  [Text] The city electoral commission yesterday 
continued registration of candidates for deputies to the City 
Assembly and reviewed complaints of independent contenders, whom 
district commissions earlier had refused to register. 
  There were a total of six petitioners. The commission 
reviewed the complaints of five yesterday. So far, only one 
candidate--Gennadiy Gordiyenko--was granted registration after 
the city commission decided that the district commission had 
invalidated too many signatures without sufficient grounds. The 
refusal to register one contender, who collected part of the 
signatures outside of his district, was upheld. The review of 
other complaints has been moved to today. The commission will 
consider the claims of Konstantin Ivanov, whom the district 
commission has accused of bribing voters, as well as of Vladimir 
Radushnyy and Feliks Sagaydakov, with respect to whom the 
district commission has annulled a considerable number of 
signatures from the lists on the grounds of suspected 
falsification. 
  The Electoral Commission Chairman Vladimir Fomichev reported 
that, by preliminary data, about 750 candidates will be in the 
running for 50 deputy seats in the City Assembly. Of them, 500 
have been nominated by electoral coalitions, and the rest are 
running as independents. 
  By profession, administrators, businessmen, and white collar 
workers comprise the greater part of contenders. The 
overwhelming majority are male.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Filippov, leader of the All </F>
Petersburg electoral coalition, by NEVSKOYE VREMYA correspondent 
Irina Lebedeva; place and date not given: "All Petersburg: Let 
Us Start With an Island"] 
  [Text] The election marathon is already halfway 
through. Of 35 electoral coalitions 17 have met the requirement 
of collecting 35,000 signatures and are nominating their members 
to run for the city assembly. Our correspondent interviewed 
Aleksandr Filippov, one of the leaders of the All Petersburg 
electoral coalition. 
  [Lebedeva] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, your bloc's desire to put 
together a team of professionals willing to take the 
responsibility for solving the city's key problems is admirable. 
A considerable share of these problems, however, is decided on a 
different level. One does not have to go far for examples. As a 
member of the higher learning community, are you prepared to 
assume responsibility for the government not fulfilling its 
obligations to people working in our institutes and universities? 
  [Filippov] There is nothing to justify such a government's 
actions: Every person must keep his word. Especially persons 
vested with authority. 
  The state has no right to remove itself from the spheres of 
life that ensure cultural, moral, intellectual, and physical 
dignity of the people. Therefore, I am bothered by Petersburg 
residents' current apathy toward elections to the city assembly. 
I was born in Leningrad; I love my city and will never agree 
that our lot, according to Pushkin, is "a yoke with rattles and 
a whip." How long can we count on rulers? My colleagues in the 
electoral coalition--finance professionals--have drafted a 
concrete program for increasing budget revenue and, accordingly, 
reorientation toward financing of socially significant spheres, 
including institutions of higher learning. The city as a 
federation component has been given sufficiently broad powers in 
matters of culture, education, and health care which we must 
use, including setting up an influential lobby in the 
government. I am not talking about pulling a blanket to our 
side; this is about conceptual things: Throughout the entire 
world culture, education, and social protection are under the 
patronage of the society. And it is at the very least 
irresponsible to leave workers in the nonproduction sphere to 
the mercy of fate and engage in demagoguery by proposing that 
they earn a living through commerce. 
  [Lebedeva] You, however, not only chair a department in the 
Petersburg University, but also are a successful businessman, 
the head of the Business Link company well known in the city, 
which was the first in the city to undertake implementation of 
the idea of territorial agencies for city reconstruction... 
  [Filippov] Three years ago when my university colleagues and 
I decided to start a consulting company, it was more an attempt 
at self-realization than a need to make money. Then came the 
idea of territorial development with the help of outside 
investors--a structure vested with sufficient powers, organized 
in order to carry out a concrete task needed by the city, with 
the right to make operational decisions. The idea was further 
developed and fine-tuned in the mayoralty's economic development 
committee. The city hopes that setting up a whole network of 
such agencies will help attract additional investment. 
  We have already registered a territorial agency for the 
development of the northwestern part of Vasilyevskiy Island. The 
plan calls for construction of a large business center in 
undeveloped territories of Vasilyevskiy Island with the help of 
foreign investment. Part of the revenue from the center's 
operation will go toward meeting the needs of the city. 
Companies will be registered in the rayon, which means that 
taxes and rents (which will be high) also will produce revenue 
for the rayon. The Vasilyevskiy Island Development Fund is the 
agency's cofounder. The money going into the local budget from 
business center utilization (which will be considerable) will be 
used to build apartments for those on the waiting list; in the 
social sphere, elimination of communal apartment living, and 
reconstruction of old buildings. We are talking about very 
specific projects that have the support of Vasileostrovskiy 
Rayon administration. By the way, the head of the rayon 
administration, Valeriy Golubev, also is running on our 
coalition's slate. 
  [Lebedeva] It looks like while all Petersburg is not yet 
part 
of your coalition, you have a good chance of bringing the entire 
Vasilyevskiy Island to your side. 
  [Filippov] By selecting this name for our coalition--which 
an 
"Itogi" correspondent recently attributed to our ambition--we 
only wanted to emphasize that the list of candidates our 
coalition is going to put on the ballot is open to all city 
residents. I thought it especially important because right now, 
despite democratic window dressing, the population is virtually 
removed from the opportunity to influence what is happening in 
the city. Even those services that operated during stagnant 
times no longer function. It is rare for a resident's petition 
or complaint to get a reply. The letters department in a 
newspaper has become an anachronism. Any talk of social activism 
of the population, or development of self-rule is perceived 
almost as retrograde. Meanwhile, for instance, in Switzerland, 
which is comparable in population size to St. Petersburg, city 
residents only need to collect 5,000 signatures to put any 
problem to a vote in the form of legislative initiative--from 
regulating store hours on holidays to the need to adopt new 
legislation on the press. To bring the problem to the federal 
level requires 50,000 signatures. Our coalition has collected 
almost as many on All Petersburg signature lists. So perhaps 
residents of our city, too, should engage without delay in 
resolution of St. Petersburg's urgent problems.

<F P=106> [Report by Lev Golovannik: "Petersburg Cannot Be Fenced In"] </F>
  [Text] Petersburg cannot be a free economic zone, 
said the mayor's chief adviser Vatanyar Yagya yesterday at a 
meeting with journalists in the American-Russian Information 
Press Center. In his opinion, the idea--great by itself--could 
be successfully implemented in our city, and in the form of not 
one but 22 subzones, the projects for which the mayoralty 
already has. 
  The potential major subzones are: Kronshtadt, Lomonosov, the 
airport, and the sea port. Foreign experience shows that a free 
economic zone should be separated from the rest of the territory 
of the country, and since it is doubtful that a fence could be 
put around all of Petersburg, the most appropriate place for it 
would be Kronshtadt because of its natural stand-alone position. 
However, as is known, Kronshtadt currently is home to a naval 
base, and the navy is not happy about having commerce for a 
neighbor. 
  Vatanyar Yagya believes that the military will not give up 
Kronshtadt, but we will not have other subzones either until the 
new State Duma passes a law defining the status of a free 
economic zone. True, there are already two such zones in 
Russia--Nakhodka Harbor and Kaliningrad Oblast; however, their 
legality remains very questionable. 
  At the press conference Vatanyar Saidovich also outlined 
priority directions along which our city authorities are trying 
to develop international cooperation. The main directions are 
the pharmaceutical and food processing industry, as well as 
transportation support. At this point, for instance, 
implementation is beginning on an agreement between Petersburg 
and Cuba for shipment of medicines to the city, of which we 
currently have only half of the needed quantities. 
  International projects in the area of the food processing 
industry envisage first and foremost reconstruction of the 
meat-packing plant, whose equipment already had become obsolete 
in the beginning of the 1930's. There is also a plan to attract 
foreign investment into setting up privately-owned bakeries in 
Petersburg. 
  The main problem in our transportation support, in the 
opinion of city authorities, may be resolved with the help of 
foreign partners--setting up our own bus manufacturing. So far, 
there are two ideas for its implementation: at the Kirov Plant 
as part of the complex of consumer goods production, and in the 
Severnyy Plant, which as a result of conversion has now began to 
manufacture mopeds.

<F P=106> [Report by Vadim Stasov: "Defense Industry Breaks the Oath </F>
of Silence"] 
  [Text] Yesterday directors of Petersburg 
military-industrial complex [VPK] enterprises discussed the 
situation in their sector. 
  "Enterprise collectives are rapidly moving towards an 
economic abyss", "a deliberate destruction of the industry is 
underway"--these quotes from the remarks of conference speakers 
reflect quite precisely the mood that reigned in the conference 
hall of one of the "secret" research institutes. 
  Directors complained about high electric power rates; about 
specialists leaving; about the government not paying for the 
output it had placed orders for. A little more of all this, and 
the Petersburg VPK will be finished for good. 
  The discussion culminated in a petition to the president, 
the 
prime minister, the chairmen of both chambers of the Federation 
Council, and the Security Council, prepared by the working group 
of the Association of Industrial Enterprises and adopted 
unanimously by 138 enterprise directors. Noting that the defense 
industry is in a critical condition, directors insist on 
holding, no later than the end of March, a special meeting of 
the parliament that would discuss the situation in the country, 
formulate the goals of socioeconomic reforms being conducted by 
the government, and work out a mechanism of officials' 
responsibility for carrying out government decisions. Also 
adopted (and also unanimously) was the text of the draft for a 
presidential edict on the measures of ensuring availability of 
finances to pay for state defense orders, which will be sent to 
Moscow together with the petition. 
  Despite these decisions, however, almost all speakers 
complained about lack of attention on the part of the 
government, which until now has not reacted at all to proposals 
and letters of defense industry captains. Having come to the 
conclusion that it was useless to rely on Moscow, the directors 
decided to look for a way out of the crisis on their own through 
joint efforts, and to prepare and adopt within the next few days 
a plan of anticrisis measures for Petersburg VPK enterprises. 
  The directors' hopes that they will finally have the 
opportunity to tell the mayor and government representatives 
face to face what they think of them, did not get realized. The 
government was represented at the conference only by Yuriy 
Kozlov, a deputy chairman of the State Committee for Defense 
Industry, for whom everything said here was no news. Neither did 
the originally planned meeting with Anatoliy Sobchak take place. 
The mayor excused himself on the grounds of an extremely busy 
schedule, and instead sent his first deputy, Dmitriy Sergeyev.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Shishov, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA </F>
correspondent: "Candidates Are Searching for Arguments"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod--The cards are on the table: 
Yevgeniy Krestyaninov, 45, deputy to the Federal Assembly, 
chairman of the Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Soviet, decided to join 
the contest for the position of the Nizhniy Novgorod local 
self-administration head. He will be running against Dmitriy 
Bednyakov, head of the city administration. Several other local 
parties are also collecting signatures for their candidates, 
among them are members of the Travkin and the communist parties. 
  During a press conference, Ye. Krestyaninov announced his 
decision not to run for the oblast legislature. In doing this, 
he hopes to avoid any accusations of trying to stay in power at 
any cost. According to Krestyaninov, the local 
self-administration head ought to establish a dynamic, lawful 
parity in the activity of the city duma administration office 
and it should not try to prevail over the representational body 
of power. Recently, he thinks, unnecessary contradictions have 
appeared in the relations between the city and the oblast. 
  Krestyaninov does not agree with the policy of the city 
administration and its head, D. Bednyakov. He thinks that the 
privatized enterprises of the public services area have been 
left to the mercy of fate. Public transportation is performing 
badly. Such services as shoe repairs have almost completely 
disappeared. 
  The famous quartet of Nizhniy Novgorod reformers, consisting 
of former city soviet chairman A. Kosarikov (he is now deputy 
governor for ecology), Ye. Krestyaninov, B. Nemtsov, and D. 
Bednyakov, has broken up. The apparent reason for the antagonism 
among the four must have been the fact that the current mayor of 
Nizhniy Novgorod started to conduct his own policy, without 
paying much attention to the interests of the oblast. 
  The general election to the representative organs of 
Nizhegorodskiy Kray will take place on 27 March. Thirty four 
deputies are supposed to be elected to the city duma. The 
districts have been determined, the city electoral commission is 
functioning, potential candidates are actively collecting 
signatures. 
  According to the regulations of the oblast soviet, a 
candidate to the city duma needs to gain the support of only one 
percent of the constituency. The city administration ruled to 
more than triple this figure. The procuracy announced a protest 
in this respect, but no concrete decision on it has been passed 
yet. 
  Governor G. Nemtsov declared that the oblast administration 
would not participate in the coming election as it adhered to 
the principle of separation of power. Ye. Krestyaninov 
characterized this Nemtsov announcement as practical respect of 
the kray executive power for the decisions of its 
representational branch.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ye.V. Afanasyev by Valeriy Natarov; place </F>
and date not given: "Concerning the `China Card.' Russia's 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arranges the Accents"] 
  [Text] Following the visit to China of A.V. Kozyrev, 
minister of foreign affairs of Russia, interest in the problem 
of relations with our eastern neighbor has grown sharply. Our 
correspondent Valeriy Natarov interviewed Ye.V. Afanasyev, first 
deputy director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Russian Federation Asia-Pacific Region First Department. 
  On Ye.V. Afanasyev's desk is an article by V. Sharov, our 
Far 
East correspondent, "The China Card" (LITERATURNAYA GAZETA No. 
43, 27 October 1993). And although this material was published 
at the end of last October, the Russian Foreign Ministry does 
not deny its relevance today also. There is a multitude of notes 
in the margins of the article, and individual paragraphs have 
been highlighted. 
  [Natarov] Yevgeniy Vladimirovich, the article "The China 
Card" outlines a very gloomy prospect for the Far 
East--multimillion Chinese masses hovering menacingly over it. 
Is the Chinese apocalypse impending? 
  [Afanasyev] It was laid on thick, of course, to say no more 
than that. And the article caught our eye immediately. 
  [Natarov] It achieved its purpose, then? 
  [Afanasyev] In the sense of catching our attention, yes. 
This 
article is one of a series of such publications, which have 
appeared in the past year in the local Far East press also. They 
purport to show that China's silent expansion is under way and 
that a vast number of Chinese are illegally penetrating our 
territory and living there. These articles maintain also that 
the territories bordering China have been stabbed in the 
back--government documents that have been signed are, in fact, 
opening our borders to the uncontrolled entry of Chinese. 
  [Natarov] Could you explain to what documents you refer? 
  [Afanasyev] The history of the matter is as follows. As 
bilateral contacts expand, there is, naturally, an increase in 
the number of people's journeys both to Russia and to China. 
Last year, for example, there were more than 1 million journeys 
from Russia to China, and from China to Russia, 2 million. And 
Russians are, perhaps, the most representative group of 
foreigners in China, what is more. In connection with the 
further development of contacts, both the center and the 
territorial authorities concluded that our citizens carrying 
diplomatic, official, and regular passports stamped "official" 
would travel to China without visas. Correspondingly, Chinese 
citizens with similar passports may enter our territory without 
visas. This procedure is based on interstate agreements, which 
were coordinated with the leaders of all the Far East oblasts in 
advance, incidentally. 
  [Natarov] That is, you see a certain distortion in this 
article: The visa-free conditions were, in fact, introduced with 
the consent of the local authorities, not in defiance of them? 
  [Afanasyev] Of course. In addition, I would like to refer to 
the stream of letters addressed to the Foreign Ministry from 
Siberia and the Far East, which say that the center is being 
slow to afford opportunities for reciprocal exchanges and that 
the expansion of free communication should be assisted. I would 
like to mention also that such a travel category as one-day 
shopping trips was introduced also on the initiative of the 
territorial authorities. Our citizens have gone on these trips 
without visas, on regular general passports, what is more. 
Chinese have, accordingly, come to us on the same basis. 
  True, it was ascertained after a certain period of time that 
dishonest people and representatives of mafia structures also 
have been actively availing themselves of the visa-free 
conditions. On both our side and the Chinese side. Chinese 
criminal elements have penetrated Russia, the number of offenses 
committed by Chinese has grown, and there has been an increase 
in the number of Chinese who have simply "gone missing" on our 
territory. 
  [Natarov] This is not, I suppose, a "headache" for the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs alone? 
  [Afanasyev] Doubtless. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
handles questions of visa practices. The rest is up to the MVD, 
the special services, the Federal Immigration Service, the 
leaders of local administrations--from kray through rayon--and 
to enterprises and organizations with direct relations with 
China. It is all of them together that create the 
situation--controlled or uncontrolled. 
  [Natarov] In other words, the local authorities have 
perfectly sufficient powers for controlling the situation 
without looking to Moscow here? 
  [Afanasyev] Perfectly correct. In addition, questions 
connected with the presence of Chinese on our territory--whether 
for business or other activity--are decided to a considerable 
extent locally. The premise contained in the article, therefore, 
to the effect that the center has opened the gates to the 
uncontrolled entry of Chinese and that this is being combated 
locally with might and main is fundamentally wrong. Basically, 
this decision was dictated to the center by a mass of requests 
from the localities. 
  But the problem about which V. Sharov writes does in fact 
exist. There are, truly, instances of disgraceful behavior on 
the part of Chinese on our territory--the examples cited in the 
article are graphic confirmation of this. But what I personally 
dislike in the way this problem is presented in "The China Card" 
article is the fact that these individual cases are attributed 
to China, that there is allegedly a conscious policy of the 
Chinese leaders aimed at winning back territory and supplanting 
the Russians, that is, creeping expansion. We in the Foreign 
Ministry and in Russia's embassy in China have the impression 
that it is by no means a question of any long-term, conscious, 
officially approved strategy. We believe that the issue of 
China's claims on our vast territory has been settled. 
  [Natarov] The question of the so-called "border 
equalization" 
in this connection. Specifically, the article of our 
correspondent mentions that the local administration is fighting 
Moscow's decision to unilaterally give China thousands of 
hectares of land. 
  [Afanasyev] This also is an entirely incorrect proposition, 
which, unfortunately, is given credence in our border 
territories, but it is based on two circumstances. The first, an 
ignorance of the essence of the border issue, which ensues from 
the secret nature of the negotiations. These negotiations had 
been conducted for more than 30 years, and the populace was not 
informed as to their content. The second, the endeavor of 
certain local political leaders to amass extra points by way of 
the incitement of nationalist sentiments. 
  The heart of the matter is that the parties agreed to 
clarify 
the line of passage of the border--4,300 km. Of these, 3,700 km 
run along the rivers Ussuri, Amur, and Argun. And here the 
parties adopted the generally recognized principle of 
international law--the border runs along the middle of the main 
channel in rivers that are navigable or along the middle of the 
river of nonnavigable rivers. That is, Mother Nature herself 
decides to whom the islands in these rivers belong. I repeat 
that this is a generally recognized principle of international 
law. This question was decided according to this principle in 
tsarist Russia also. 
  The agreement on the eastern section of the border signed in 
1991 has been ratified by the parliaments of the two countries. 
This agreement is already in operation, and any attempts to 
revise it would lead to confrontation and conflict with China. 
We know full well to what the unsettled nature of the 
territorial problem with China led from the history of the 
1960's: Remember Damanskiy Island. 
  As far as thousands of hectares of land are concerned, this 
is absolute rubbish. The borders are being clarified, as a 
result of which some sections will pass from China to Russia, 
some, from Russia to China. Representatives of the local 
authorities also are taking part in the demarcation work, 
naturally. 
  [Natarov] Let us return to the problem of illegal 
penetration 
of our territory. What are the ways of resolving it? 
  [Afanasyev] There is a problem of illegal residence and 
penetration. In some communities, considering the sparse 
population of our areas, there are more Chinese than Russian 
citizens. In these cases, specific measures need to be 
adopted--in conjunction with the central authorities, the local 
authorities, and various departments. And such measures are 
being adopted, incidentally. This matter was raised in the 
course of A.V. Kozyrev's recent visit to Beijing, and the 
Chinese side expressed understanding of this problem; more, the 
Chinese representatives were concerned to ensure that the 
impressions gained from the actions of individual Chinese 
offenders not be transferred in the minds of Russian people to 
China as a whole. Two agreements on visa travel, which tighten 
control of border crossing, have been in effect since 29 
January. Thus, travel on regular passports with the "official" 
stamp has been abolished--and a multitude of trips with such 
passports had been made on both our side and the Chinese 
side--and visa conditions for all travel other than group 
tourist travel are being introduced. Special tourist 
companies--there are five of them currently in the Far 
East--which will draw up the papers for visa-free tourist travel 
to China, have been distinguished. I would like to emphasize 
that all these questions are being tackled on a reciprocal 
basis. It is the bilateral nature of the resolution of 
Russian-Chinese problems that I would like to emphasize. The 
article "The China Card" is guilty of a one-sidedness of 
consideration of the problem. After all, it is perfectly obvious 
that if we restrict the entry of Chinese, we have a right to 
expect the same actions of the Chinese authorities. 
  [Natarov] Is there any information on the response to the 
publication "The China Card" in China itself? 
  [Afanasyev] Yes, this article was noticed in China. I will 
tell you that in unofficial conversations Chinese have told me 
that they were wondering whether or not to start a polemic with 
us, that is, who are worse: the Chinese in Russia or the 
Russians in China. 
  [Natarov] They have no less of a bill? 
  [Afanasyev] Yes. But ultimately the Chinese decided to 
refrain. They are of the opinion that the start of a public 
argument on these matters would have an extremely negative 
effect on our bilateral relations. There is much evidence, 
incidentally, of disgraceful and criminal behavior of our 
citizens in China, and were the Chinese to judge the whole 
Russian people by these cases, no good would come of this. 
  To sum up, a calm, realistic approach to this problem is 
needed. We need to take a look at it and need to think how to 
resolve it, but there should under no circumstances be 
exaggerations in the direction of charges against China and the 
Chinese people as a whole, their being ascribed sinister 
intentions of expansion into Russia. This problem can be 
resolved perfectly easily by way of order being brought to bear 
within our country and the regulation of the rules of 
foreigners' residence, with regard to the new realities. The law 
enforcement authorities of Russia and China should cooperate 
actively, and there are examples of this. 
  In short, under no circumstances must we once again erect 
along our border with China a "Wall of China" and estrange our 
countries and peoples. A prudent combination of freedom, 
communication, movement, trade and other relations, and the most 
elementary order determined by the border regime, are needed. 
This is entirely within the capabilities of good 
neighbors--Russia and China.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Belotserkovskiy: "Shameful Solidarity: </F>
When Politicians Are Incapable of Defending Their Own People"] 
  [Text] Munich--The unity of almost all factions of the 
State Duma and the executive authorities on the Serbia question 
is the most shameful disgrace. For it is clear to even the least 
informed (it is clear even to Zhirinovskiy, I am sure) that the 
Serbs are the aggressors and the main culprits of the orgy of 
brutality in the former Yugoslavia. More than merely beginning 
to tear away Serbian enclaves from Croatia and Bosnia (and 
wanting prior to this to compel by force even Slovenia to remain 
part of Yugoslavia), they captured entirely foreign territories, 
expelling from and driving out of them the indigenous population 
with the aid of terror and violence--a practice and crime wholly 
monstrous at the end of the 20th century, in Europe, what is 
more, at the center of Christian civilization! All this is as 
clear as two times two is four. Yes, brutalities are being 
perpetrated there now by all sides, and there is no 
justification for this, but it was Serbia's aggression that 
started it, and it alone can end it, having ceased the 
aggression and having returned the captured territories, wholly 
foreign territories--in which Serbs do not live--at least. And 
it is further clear to everyone that this aggression was begun 
and continues in accordance with the wishes and under the 
leadership of the nomenklatura communists, who still hold sway 
in Serbia, and that they are doing this to hold on to power, 
distract attention, and appear as patriots of a Greater Serbia. 
And to whom if not us former Soviet people should their behavior 
be very understandable, we, of all people, should know of what 
demagogy and brutality communists are capable for the sake of 
power. Finally, it is clear also that the European countries 
should long ago have intervened and stopped this medieval war, 
just as it is clear that it cannot be stopped by political 
measures alone, without the use of military force or the decided 
intention of its use. And it is a disgrace that the NATO 
countries have not yet done this. Compare this with Kuwait! If 
there were oil in Bosnia and Croatia, all would have been ended 
a long time ago. But flowing there, instead of oil, is merely 
blood, which is not quoted on the world market. The democratic 
community of the West considers the incapacity of its 
authorities to halt the orgy of cannibalism at the heart of 
Europe the breakup, virtually, of Western civilization, 
capitalist civilization, I am sorry to say. And only the Russian 
political elite, which is represented in all branches of power, 
thinks otherwise, more precisely, pretends to think otherwise, 
and wants once again to put Russia in a position in opposition 
to the world's democratic community. 
  The profound immorality of Russia's politicians, who for the 
sake of gaining political dividends within Russia are prepared 
to hamper the efforts to finally halt the bloodshed and violence 
in Bosnia, can be seen behind this position. Is not the shelling 
from guns at Bosnian cities, in which peaceful people, old men, 
women, and children, are dying, reminiscent of the shelling of 
the White House, in which there were women and children also? 
But the deputies of the Federal Assembly are not demanding an 
investigation or trial of those guilty of shelling the House of 
Soviets. They are demanding (of the Foreign Ministry) protection 
of Serbia's "Special Militia" against possible strikes, which is 
far easier and safer (for the deputies). We should, generally, 
clearly understand the cause of the clamorous attempts of all 
branches of power to protect the "Slav brothers" in the Balkans 
(as though Bosnians and Croats are not Slavs!) or the Russian 
speakers in the Baltic. They are caused by the fact that the 
authorities are incapable of protecting Russians in Russia! 
Incapable of protecting them against gangsters and hired 
killers, incapable of changing the situation engendering a 
tumultuous growth of crime, incapable of protecting people dying 
from the lack or cost of medicinal drugs and inadequate medical 
assistance and on account of the scant diet and polluted 
environment, and incapable of protecting them against state and 
mafia robbery. But let us imagine: Inflation has been halted, 
prices are headed down, production is up, housing is being built 
once again, crime is being suppressed. Zhirinovskiy, of course, 
would be shaking his fist even here (what else could he do?), 
but the majority of deputies and leaders of the executive would 
not for anything be going against the Western governments in 
their attempts to halt the war in Bosnia. They would have no 
need to earn political capital from dubious protection outside 
of Russia or to kindle hysteria over the dubious violation of 
the rights of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic 
(which is not comparable to what is being done against Russians 
in some southern republics of the CIS, where, however, Russian 
troops are protecting the local authorities against the 
opposition!). Just as there would be no need either to conduct 
ethnic purges in Moscow and Petersburg in order if only in this 
way to attempt to win sympathy among the most embittered and 
unethical people. But in defending the interests of the 
nomenklatura, the majority of members of the executive and the 
legislature cannot defend the interests of the people. The two 
are incompatible. It is necessary to deprive of power and 
ownership (of the means of production) either the nomenklatura 
or the people. The "democrats" are defending the interests 
chiefly of the new and center nomenklatura, the "communists," 
the old and peripheral nomenklatura, and the "national 
patriots," both and, particularly, the interests of the 
nomenklatura of the power departments. Under these conditions, 
how could they all not defend the interests of the Serbs in 
Bosnia? 
  More precisely, rattle the air in their defense or not 
approach the hot line with Washington. 
  The world is now anxiously conjecturing whether fascism is 
possible in Russia. The appearance of the majority of 
politicians in Russia in the wake of Zhirinovskiy against an 
ultimatum to the Serbs in Bosnia indicates that it is possible. 
An atmosphere of immorality and cynicism is the vital 
environment of any fascism and an essential condition. The 
unimpeded and endless decline in the living standard of the 
majority of the population is a complementary condition. 
  P.S. When I had already completed this article, there came 
the report of a statement of Churkin, deputy minister of foreign 
affairs, whom this report called the personal representative of 
the president (!), to the effect that the Western governments 
were misinterpreting the latest UN resolution giving its 
secretary general the right to sanction the use of military 
force in Bosnia without Security Council confirmation. No, 
Churkin declared, the Security Council must on each occasion 
confirm such a sanction. Thus Churkin, as the personal 
representative of the president, has, aside from anything else, 
disavowed the statement of Vorontsov, ambassador of Russia at 
the United Nations, who had declared earlier that the secretary 
general was "absolutely right" and that Security Council 
confirmation was not required. Together with everyone else, the 
Russian delegation at the United Nations voted for the 
above-mentioned resolution, but after Mr. Zhirinovskiy had 
scored a success at the elections, the authorities fouled their 
pants somewhat and in an endeavor to keep up with Zhirinovskiy 
and the other national patriots in Slav solidarity are 
renouncing their vote at the United Nations, going back on their 
own word. The former nomenklatura communists and their retinue 
are showing the world what the rules of the game mean for them 
when they are to their disadvantage. All that is useful for the 
cause of the proletariat is moral. All that is useful for the 
cause of the nomenklatura, the president, and the government is 
competent.

<F P=106> [Interview with N.I. Drozdov, deputy minister of foreign </F>
economic relations of the Russian Federation, by Boris Rachkov; 
date and place not given: "Russia-U.S. Business Partnership: One 
More Chance?"] 
  [Text] The 20th century, in a large part of which the 
fate of mankind has been determined by the nature of relations 
between Moscow and Washington, which are situated in different 
halves of the world, will soon be at an end. The polar 
opposition of the superpowers personifying them made a heavy 
impression on all of world history. Not a geographical 
opposition, of course, but one that grew out of political, 
ideological, and social contradictions. It was to this that the 
cooperation of the two states, potentially boundless in terms of 
mutual advantage, was sacrificed. They could long ago have 
become the world's biggest business partners, but are as yet 
still scrutinizing each other and measuring one another, as it 
were. 
  "And it is not the first time that we have taken these 
measurements, what is more," Nikolay Ustinovich Drozdov, deputy 
minister of foreign economic relations of the Russian 
Federation, says in conversation with an EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN 
correspondent on Russian-American trade and economic relations 
at their present stage. "Attempts at a rapprochement have been 
made repeatedly, by people of several generations, it may be 
said. And all such attempts have had one thing in common: They 
have been imperiously dictated to both countries by some 
irresistible forces and fateful circumstances which forced the 
politicians of Moscow and Washington to forgo antagonism for the 
sake of the simple survival of their states." 
  [Rachkov] You are referring, most likely, primarily to the 
joint participation of the USSR and the United States in the war 
against Hitler fascism and Japanese militarism? 
  [Drozdov] This also, of course. But not only this. Ten years 
before the attack by fascist Germany on the Soviet Union, and by 
Japan on America's Pearl Harbor, the entire Western world, the 
United States in particular, lay in the ruins of an 
unprecedented economic crisis. But that crisis stopped at 
borders beyond which lay one-sixth of the land area of the 
globe--the Soviet Union--where, albeit by brutal methods, the 
vigorous experiment of "Stalin's industrialization" was being 
undertaken. It created a tremendous demand for American and 
other equipment. In order to give at least some additional 
stimulus to its crisis-ridden industry the United States--the 
last of the great powers, after 16 years of hesitation--finally 
recognized the "Bolshevik dictatorship" diplomatically. In 
exchange for our goods and gold, Washington encouraged the 
supply to us of a considerable quantity of equipment, which 
brought back to the American plants tens of thousands of 
unemployed. But then the economy in the West picked up, and the 
vicissitudes of geopolitics threw Stalin and Hitler into one 
another's embrace for some time, which contributed to a winding 
down of economic relations with the United States, right up 
until the start of the joint struggle for survival at the height 
of World War II. 
  [Rachkov] And then the cold shower for our business 
relations 
with America and the majority of Western countries was the cold 
war, which dragged on for many years. Am I right? 
  [Drozdov] Yes, this is common knowledge. And one further 
attempt, far-reaching, I would say, at the trade and economic 
rapprochement of Moscow and Washington was made within our 
memory even. 
  After all, in the first decades following World War II 
supernatural force was in the full meaning of the words 
concentrated in the nuclear warheads of the superpowers. And the 
Caribbean crisis of the fall of 1962 just about sprang this 
genie from the "bottle," which would have been lethal for the 
whole world. The world was horrified at the threat of 
destruction at that time, Moscow and Washington were horrified. 
Under the conditions of the recognition of this global threat 
and on the last waves of Khrushchev's "thaw" and in the last 
months in office in the United States of the commonsensical 
President John Kennedy, our countries once again took a number 
of important steps toward one another. The treaty banning 
nuclear tests in three spheres was signed in August 1963. 
Economic contacts were stepped up. But this strongly aroused 
"hawks" of all stripes also. The assassination of Kennedy and 
the ouster of Khrushchev once again froze our relations for a 
number of years. But the common fear in the face of nuclear 
self-annihilation and the need for mutual tolerance, impossible 
without economic interaction, now made themselves felt, for all 
that. The start of the 1970's were, truly, marked by steps, 
unparalleled for both superpowers, in the creation of the legal 
foundations of trade and economic cooperation at the interstate 
and public levels. 
  [Rachkov] I remember those years distinctly. Of all the 
"projects of the century" which loomed at that time, a contract 
for the supply to the United States of Russian urea for nitrogen 
fertilizers in short supply there and for the supply to the CIS 
of American source material for phosphorous fertilizer, which is 
in short supply with us, is being realized currently to this 
extent or the other. Towering up as a solid monument to that 
period on Krasnaya Presnya is the Moscow International Trade 
Center, which was built by the billionaire Armand Hammer, the 
enthusiast of American-Russian cooperation, for a sizable fee, 
of course. And, in addition, the Soyuz-Apollo brand of 
cigarettes--a reminder of the impressive attempt to begin the 
cooperation of the USSR and the United States in space 
orbits--also still flickers in places, like the light of a 
distant star. But where are all the other cherished dreams, 
preliminary outlines, and projects? 
  [Drozdov] It is worth remembering the most far-reaching 
voluntary association of business circles of the two powers 
which emerged at that time for the purpose of promoting their 
cooperation--American-Soviet Trade and Economic Cooperation 
(ASTEC). It united on both sides over 500 firms, banks, 
enterprises, establishments, and organizations. But it no longer 
exists either, alas. But it cannot be said that ASTEC was 
useless. On the contrary, it performed a great deal of work. 
But, to be frank, it did not justify all hopes and is now being 
transformed into new associations. 
  But, generally, the onslaught of the supporters of 
cooperation of the start of the 1970's once again became bogged 
down--and once again on account of the oppression of policy and 
confrontation ideology. As in the 1960's the transatlantic 
"hawks" plunged the United States into the Vietnam slaughter, so 
at the end of the 1970's our apologies for strategists involved 
the USSR in the Afghan adventure. Against the background of the 
permanent Near East crisis, both were repeatedly accompanied by 
Moscow's and Washington's stern and rather dangerous warnings 
leveled at one another. People were not in the mood for 
large-scale trade and reciprocal work on long-term projects 
here. There had, most likely, to be a new turn in history which 
once again revealed to the new generation of politicians and 
ideologists the futility and ruinous nature of their obdurate 
opposition. 
  [Rachkov] Following the logic of your arguments, I would 
venture to maintain that this historical turn was the start of 
the democratic transformations in our country at the turn of the 
1990's, and in the United States, the ruling establishment's 
abandonment of the view of us as the "evil empire." This turn, 
dictated by the entire bitter experience of the antagonism, 
which had grown wearisome, was, truly, all-sufficing and 
"fateful" for mankind, as our first democrats put it. The world 
for the first time breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the 
cold war and both superpowers began to undertake mutually 
coordinated disarmament and take new steps on the path of 
economic cooperation. 
  [Drozdov] And once again not everything was that simple. In 
the past two years Moscow and Washington have implemented very 
important measures in the sphere of normalization of trade and 
economic cooperation. But I would not yet venture to call them 
historic, from which I am restrained by the experience of 
previous disappointments. And there is still considerable work 
to be done by myself and my colleagues and you journalists, and, 
generally, all responsible people in Russia and the United 
States for a departure as far as possible from the abyss of 
confrontation, economic included. Judge by the facts. 
  Yes, Washington has removed many of the discriminatory trade 
and political restrictions which had been established in respect 
to the former USSR and which had operated in respect to Russia. 
Thus Russia has for the first time since 1951 been accorded 
most-favored-nation status in trade. The legislative 
prohibitions on credit to us along the lines of the 
Commodity-Credit Corporation and the Export-Import Bank of the 
United States have been revoked. The restrictions on the special 
government insurance agency of the United States--the Overseas 
Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)--have been removed. Russia 
has acquired the opportunity to use soft long-term loans in 
accordance with the Food for Progress program. The extension to 
us of the General System of Customs Preferences will contribute 
to the increased efficiency of the exports of a whole number of 
our commodities to the United States. 
  Yes, we take a positive view of the Furtherance of Reform in 
New Democratic Countries Act, which has been adopted in the 
United States: It provides for the abolition of more than 70 
legislative restrictions established in the years of the cold 
war. The reform of Cocom which is being undertaken at the 
present time is reason to believe that there will shortly be 
considerable movement in the direction of abolition of the 
discriminatory restrictions on supplies to Russia of 
research-intensive goods and technology, which have been in 
effect for more than 40 years. 
  At the same time a number of discriminatory restrictions 
preventing the building of bilateral trade and economic 
relations on a firm long-term basis continues to operate in 
respect to Russia. For example, the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, 
which was introduced 20 years ago, gives the American side the 
right at any time to unilaterally cancel the most-favored-nation 
status in trade which has been accorded Russia. Antidumping 
procedures, which are hampering our exports to the United States 
or threatening to squeeze out of the American market a number of 
important Russian raw material commodities (carbamide, 
ferrosilicon, aluminum, and others), continue to operate. And 
the antidumping procedures applied in respect to our exporters 
are considerably more harsh and onerous than those that are 
applied in respect to the vast majority of countries, what is 
more. 
  In sum, the United States' share of Russia's foreign trade 
turnover is not even 2 percent, and Russia's share of America's 
trade is gauged in only tenths of 1 percent. And at the present 
stage of scientific and technological development the 
traditional forms of our trade and economic relations with the 
United States based on the buying and selling of commodities 
are, generally, exhausted to a considerable extent, evidently. 
Extensive investment cooperation should, I believe, contribute 
to the advancement of these relations to an entirely different 
level in keeping with our desires and the immense potentials of 
the two countries. 
  Unfortunately, here also we are still only at the start: The 
share of American investments in the sum total of foreign 
capital investments in the economy of Russia constitutes only 10 
percent approximately ($500 million). In tiny Hungary, 
incidentally, American investments constitute over $2.5 billion. 
American companies explain their caution on the question of 
investments in our economy by the high degree of risk connected 
with the political instability in Russia. It is possible to view 
this problem from the other side also, however--the political 
instability is largely explained primarily by the economic 
instability. An acceleration of the process of stabilization of 
the Russian economy with the aid of investments of the United 
States and other Western countries could contribute to a 
considerable extent to political consolidation in our country. 
  We are prepared to take the necessary steps to attract 
direct 
investments of the United States in Russia. Cooperation could 
encompass the leasing and concession of fuel and raw material 
deposits, land, and forest tracts and the organization of joint 
ventures for the in-depth processing of natural resources and 
agricultural raw material, which are generally accepted in world 
practice, between Western countries included. We could undertake 
the sale at auction or the leasing of real estate, including 
incomplete construction projects, and also the sale of 
securities and shares of stock of enterprises and organizations, 
the processing with the aid of foreign investments of numerous 
types of waste and secondary raw material, the investment of 
capital in the creation of a modern industry of tourism and 
infrastructural facilities for business, and so forth. 
  The development of bilateral investment cooperation should 
be 
accompanied by a sound treaty and legal base. The first stones 
in this foundation have already been laid. 
  Despite all this, the Russian side is endeavoring in every 
way to overcome the current, not entirely logical situation 
where the United States is prepared, seemingly, to cooperate 
with us on a large scale and even render assistance with its 
resources, but is at the same time in practice permitting 
actions preventing Russia earning these resources independently, 
on the American market included. 
  [Rachkov] Generally, a turnabout in Russian-American 
business 
relations appropriate to the political changes has not yet 
occurred. More, the results of our December elections were 
reason for certain circles in the United States, and in Russia 
also, to recall the vocabulary of the times of the cold war. And 
some observers are inclined to belittle the visits to Moscow of 
Vice President A. Gore and President B. Clinton, which have just 
taken place, including their significance for economic relations. 
  [Drozdov] Yes, the struggle of opposites continues, but 
under 
the conditions of a lower intensity, that is, under less 
hopeless conditions. While not a reckless optimist, I personally 
discern signs that there should no longer be an abrupt new 
rollback in our economic rapprochement. Why do I think this? 
Mainly because the democratic transformations in our country, 
the market reforms included, and Washington's healthy 
appreciation of them leave increasingly less room for an orgy of 
the totally uncontrolled, suspicious forces, I would say, on 
which we touched at the start of the discussion--be they chaos 
in the world economy or the nuclear genie in a missile package. 
There is today an opportunity to control them. 
  Only democracy and common sense finally enabled the leaders 
of our superpowers to trust one another to the extent that they 
are switching from words and small deeds in the sphere of 
disarmament to actual steps. And the first truly promising 
prospects for the economic cooperation of our superpowers have 
been afforded simultaneously. 
  The visits of the top two Americans to Moscow and their 
meetings with the leaders of Russia were not, truly, of direct 
significance for foreign trade in its traditional form. But 
together with the legal base, which was prepared not long prior 
to this at intergovernmental level, they laid the first tangible 
stone in the interaction of Russia and the United States in 
areas which pertain to the "holy of holies" of their military 
power and which had for this reason been so jealously guarded 
until most recent days. I refer to the long-term contract for 
the processing at plants of the United States of the nuclear 
filling from almost 180 Soviet missiles into peaceful fuel for 
the needs of America's nuclear power stations for a sum total of 
$12 billion. Particular compensation has been specified for 
Ukraine and Belarus. But the potential benefits to be derived 
from such a contract by the superpowers themselves and the 
world, particularly considering the fact that this has only just 
begun, are immeasurable. 
  There is much that is symbolic here also, incidentally. I 
was 
present at the signing of the contract, which took place in the 
hall of the collegium of the former Ministry of Medium Machine 
Building--the very hall where all the serious decisions on the 
creation of Soviet nuclear weapons had been adopted. 
  The first large-scale agreements on commercial cooperation 
in 
space, in which it was hard to believe just several years ago, 
have been reached. These include the joint flights of American 
astronauts and our cosmonauts and the creation of an 
international orbital station and scientific and technological 
cooperation in space. Science fiction is, you will agree, 
becoming reality. 
  [Rachkov] So history has accorded Russia and the United 
States one more chance to become worthy business partners. This 
has coincided almost, Nikolay Ustinovich, with your appointment 
to the office of deputy minister of foreign economic relations 
of the Russian Federation in charge of business relations with 
North America. What can you say about this coincidence? 
  [Drozdov] The said events are not to be compared, of course. 
But this invests my colleagues and myself with a special 
responsibility, nonetheless. Especially since I have been 
entrusted also with the position of executive secretary of the 
Russian-American Economic and Technological Cooperation 
Commission, of which V.S. Chernomyrdin and A. Gore are the 
cochairmen. The committees of the commission are led by 
ministers and other high-level persons of the governments of the 
two countries. This is a very serious instrument of 
intergovernmental interaction in the economic sphere and yet 
further evidence of the seriousness of the parties' intention 
not to let slip the present and, possibly, last historical 
opportunity in their economic relations. History might not 
forgive any force majeure now.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Shevchenko: "Conference in the Russian </F>
State Customs Committee: Customs Service Decides To Curtail 
Budget Losses"] 
  [Text] Continuing now over the course of several 
years, the reorganization of operations of the Russian customs 
service has apparently reached its peak. Despite the fact that 
the three-day all-Russian conference of the heads of customs 
organs that ended yesterday was originally supposed to 
generalize the results of 1993 operations, the main issues 
discussed here were problems related to the introduction into 
customs operations of concepts new to the service. This involves 
not only a whole series of documents dedicated to customs 
procedures, but also the transfer to the State Customs Committee 
of functions as main currency control agent.

<H3>  From the Report of Russian State Customs Committee Chairman 
Anatoliy Kruglov </H3>
  Following completion of its structural reorganization, the 
Russian customs service comprises 12 regional directorates, 127 
customs offices, and 413 customs check points. According to 1993 
freight customs declarations, 1.9 million export and import 
dispatches were registered, as were 3.2 billion tonnes of 
freight, 14.7 transportation facilities, and baggage and 
property of more than 275 million physical persons. 
  According to preliminary data, customs officials put R3.8 
trillion [rubles] (including over $970 million) into the Russian 
federal budget. This constitutes 15 percent of the revenue 
portion of the federal budget. The export of about 4,000 objects 
of art and antiquities was prevented. More than 50,000 firearms 
and ammunition, and over 2.4 tonnes of narcotics were seized.

  No matter how impressive the figures sound that are cited in 
the report of State Customs Committee head Anatoliy Kruglov, the 
customs service has accumulated more than its share of problems. 
The main portion of these are related to the introduction of new 
customs operating procedures. For the majority of customs 
workers in the regions, their exact role remains a puzzlement. 
They are confused as to how and for what the required customs 
fees should be exacted. Assembling employees at the conference 
not just from the central region but from the outlying areas as 
well, committee leaders attempted to explain the essence of the 
operating modes being introduced and procedure for their 
practical application. Customs employees are troubled most of 
all, it turns out, by the freight-in-transit mode. The fact of 
the matter is that in the absence of a precise regulatory 
statute in this regard, freight often does not reach its 
intended destination. As we know, it is precisely for this 
reason that the system of bond duties for excise commodities was 
introduced. Nonetheless, this measure has not corrected the 
situation, in the view of customs officials. The customs service 
has therefore gone one step further and announced the creation 
of a special customs escort structure. 
  The next sphere of problems examined at the conference 
concerned the introduction of rigid requirements in the 
importing of certain commodities and increased customs fees in 
their regard. In particular, a reduction in volume of imported 
automobiles was noted. The state budget simply loses as a result. 
  No less serious have been the problems associated with 
nonreceipt of appropriate hard currency proceeds from exports. 
Currency control was therefore discussed especially thoroughly 
at the conference. In spite of customs service efforts, the 
Russian budget loses something on the order of $10 billion 
annually, according to data cited at the conference. Although it 
was in 1993 that the function of main currency controller was 
transferred to the Russian State Customs Committee, observers 
believe there is still a long way to go before practical results 
of this measure are seen. The reasons for this are the absence 
of technical capabilities for setting up precise customs control 
over foreign trade operations and the lack of personnel training 
for this activity. It was reported at the conference that plans 
call for the establishment in 1994 of a single technological 
system for registering and controlling the movement of freight 
and effecting financial deductions. This system is supposed to 
unite all customs structures--from the customs check point to 
the State Customs Committee. If successfully instituted, this 
system will result in significant reductions in the time 
required to register freight and will enable timely and accurate 
compilations of customs statistics to be made. But in order for 
hard currency control to really begin to function--first and 
foremost with respect to the export of strategic raw materials 
and later for other commodities, specialized subdivisions are 
being instituted at all authorized banks which will have direct 
contact with the Russian State Customs Committee and Federal 
Currency Control Service.

<H5>  COMMENTARY </H5>
  The conference was essentially a training session for 
personnel from the localities. According to the Law on Customs 
Duties and the Customs Code, the authority of the State Customs 
Committee has been significantly expanded. First of all, in 
collecting duties, value-added tax, and excise tax from imported 
production, the State Customs Committee is carrying out fiscal 
functions. Secondly, in increasing the number of customs 
operating procedures, the State Customs Committee is controlling 
a new segment of entrepreneurial activity. Thirdly, the customs 
service is the pivotal element in the system of hard currency 
control (for both the Central Bank of Russia and Ministry for 
Foreign Economic Relations scenarios). It is the customs 
authorities that start up the mechanism for circulation of 
information: exporter--State Customs Committee--authorized 
banks. They can actually dispute the contract prices of 
exporters and importers. The multi-profile nature of the customs 
service is turning the State Customs Committee into the 
department possessing the most powerful arsenal of weapons for 
effecting real regulation of foreign economic activity.

<F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov: "All of Russia Encompassed by </F>
Hard Currency Control"] 
  [Text] The system of hard currency and export control 
has been extended to cover the entire territory of the Russian 
Federation. In accordance with the Decree of the Russian 
Government "On the Territorial Organs of Hard Currency and 
Export Control," territorial organs of the Russian Federal 
Service for Hard-Currency and Export Control are being 
established in a number of oblast centers of Russia, including 
Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
  The Russian Federal Service for Hard Currency and Export 
Control was established in June of last year by special 
governmental decree. In accordance with the Government's 
decision, the service was granted broad authority, enabling it 
to obtain information on the movement of hard currency in 
exporter accounts. In the absence of a federal network of 
subordinate structures, however, its attention was concentrated 
mainly on the large-scale producers of export production that 
have customs and hard currency privileges and on authorized 
banks. 
  With adoption of the Decree "On the Territorial Organs of 
Hard Currency and Export Control," the central organ of the 
Russian Hard Currency Control Service obtained the opportunity 
to "spread networks" throughout the territory of Russia. Now 
organs involved in controlling exports and the procedure for use 
of hard currency are being established in Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, and in a number of oblast centers. The decree also 
establishes the total number of employees in these territorial 
organs at 350 persons (not including security and building 
maintenance personnel). The wages of directors and employees of 
the territorial organs are established at the level of the 
appropriate category of employee in the central service. The 
apparatus of the territorial organs will be financed out of 
state budget funds. 
  Clearly, the formation of a network of territorial organs of 
export and hard currency control will not make life easier for 
Russian exporters. But the effectiveness of the new system is 
not indisputable in any case--there was no shortage of control 
personnel in the regions prior to the establishment of special 
control organs, and the practice of unlawful use of hard 
currency obtained from export operations was nonetheless 
widespread.

Export Control Will Be Situated </H3>

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Loginov and Andrey Melnikov under the </F>
rubric "Business: Foreign Banks in Russia": "Western Bankers 
Take First Cautious Steps in Russia"] 
  [Text] The scandal that continued this week regarding 
the privatization of Bank Slaski in Poland (a large block of 
shares was purchased at clearly understated prices by a major 
foreign investor--ING Bank of Holland) has once again drawn 
attention to the problem of the presence of Western bank capital 
in the postsocialist countries. Much dispute was seen in Russia 
in 1993 as to whether or not to allow foreign bank capital into 
the country. As a result, those who support protection of the 
national banking system from foreign competitors managed to 
effect a temporary restriction on the sphere of activity of 
foreign bankers in Russia. Nonetheless, a number of banks that 
obtained licenses in 1993 have in fact begun operations. 
<H5>  Little in Credits, Few Rubles, Few Resident Clients </H5>
  Of course, foreign banks in Russia have not yet moved as far 
ahead as they have in Poland and Hungary. But already the first 
few months of foreign bank activity in the country enable us to 
note certain "partialities" of bankers from abroad. First of all 
it must be said that because of the unfavorable economic 
situation and opposition from a certain segment of the Russian 
business community and establishment, the arrival of foreign 
banks in Russia is not proceeding very energetically. In 
particular, this is reflected in the extremely cautious approach 
Western banks are using in matters of investments and extension 
of credits to borrowers. In their first stage of operation 
virtually all foreign banks in Russia have concentrated on 
providing clearing-operations services for clients. 
  Foreign banks are opening and managing current accounts, 
issuing cash currency, effecting international money transfers, 
opening letters of credit, performing deposit and conversion 
transactions, issuing guarantees, and providing consulting 
services to clients on capital investment matters. As a rule, 
payments within Russia are effected through a system of 
corresponding accounts opened in Russian banks. 
  A comparison of terms for opening accounts and the amount of 
commission charged by foreign banks and their Russian colleagues 
shows that the foreign banks are trying to avoid standing out 
too much. Their rates are not very different from the rates of 
the leading Russian banks, although in a number of instances 
they exceed the latter. Bank Austria and BNP-Dresdner Bank 
(Rossija) have a "more democratic" look, for example. The bank 
Societe Generale Russie stands out somewhat--$1,000 to open an 
account, and a slight hint to the effect that small-scale 
clients need not apply. 
  Nonresidents predominate as clients of the foreign banks. 
This is not just related to the temporary ban on servicing 
Russian firms and citizens. A particular feature of the strategy 
of a number of large-scale foreign banks is the fact that they 
are striving not so much to gain a local clientele as to 
"escort" their traditional clients, creating comfortable 
conditions for them to carry out their business in a new country 
(Societe Generale Russie) or facilitating the economic relations 
of a particular country with Russia (Bank of China in Russia). 
After obtaining an "offshore" license from the Central Bank, 
Bank Austria set as its goal from the very beginning the aim of 
"seizing" the money of foreign firms and citizens operating in 
Russia, not the money of residents of Russia. The ethnic 
composition of the clientele of foreign banks varies. Bank of 
China in Russia services Chinese firms or joint enterprises 
almost exclusively, with the participation of Chinese capital. 
The European banks are more "international." Only one-fifth of 
all the clients of Bank Austria constitute Austrian companies 
and citizens. 
  Juridical persons predominate as clients of foreign banks. 
The explanation for this can also be found in the particular 
policy features of a number of banks (for example, the bank 
Societe Generale does not do "retail" banking business at all 
outside the borders of France). Foreign banks are presently 
performing transactions primarily in hard currency and they are 
in no hurry to initiate ruble transactions. 
  However, 1994 promises to become a year of more intense 
activity on the part of foreign banks in Russia. First of all, 
during the course of the year at least another six banks will 
begin operations in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Secondly, it is 
expected that at mid-year the restrictions on foreign bank 
activity imposed by the 15 November 1993 presidential edict will 
be lifted. KOMMERSANT-DAILY will return frequently to the 
problem of the presence of foreign banks in the country. 
<H5>  Bank Austria (Z-Landerbank Bank Austria AG) </H5>
  Bank Austria was the first foreign bank to obtain the right 
to open a branch in Russia (License No. 1). The branch began 
operations on 7 December 1992. Today 30 people work in the 
branch, of whom only two are foreigners. In essence, the branch 
is an offshore banking institution without the right to service 
residents of Russia. It operates exclusively with nonresidents. 
As of today, the bank's clientele numbers in the hundreds. Over 
half the clients of the Moscow branch of Bank Austria are firms 
(corporate customers), approximately one-third are physical 
persons (private customers), and about 20 percent are financial 
institutions. In the future it is possible that the circle of 
clients will be expanded by virtue of joint enterprises with the 
participation of Russian capital. The bank does not intend to 
carry on business with "pure" residents in the near future. 
  The Moscow branch of Bank Austria carries out transactions 
in 
foreign currency exclusively. It is tied into the Reuters 
Dealing system and SWIFT system. The bank devotes special 
attention to cash currency transactions. Ready cash can be 
obtained at the Austrian bank itself or at the offices of 
Russian banks with which Bank Austria has concluded special 
agreements (specifically, in Moscow--with Tokobank, in St. 
Petersburg--with the bank St. Petersburg).

  Holder of Central Bank of Russia License No. 2. The bank's 
charter fund--20 million ECU (about $22.5 million). The founders 
of Credit Lyonnais Russie are Credit Lyonnais Europe (35 
percent), Credit Lyonnais Belgique (30 percent), and Credit 
Lyonnais Global Banking (35 percent). The bank officially opened 
in December 1992 and began operations in July 1993. 
  Presently the bank does business with juridical persons and 
Russian commercial banks (number of clients totals about 120). 
Private individuals comprise an insignificant portion of the 
clientele. Commission rates charged by the bank have been 
declared a commercial secret. In the words of bank officials, 
these are not published in either full or abbreviated form and 
are not taken out of the bank premises. Deposit rates are 
established for each specific instance by agreement with the 
client, depending on type of currency, amount of deposit, and 
term of deposit. Minimum amount of deposit is set at $50,000 (or 
its equivalent in any freely convertible currency).

<H5>  BNP--Dresdner Bank (Rossija) </H5>
  The bank's founders are Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and 
Dresdner Bank AG, each of which owns 50 percent of the capital. 
The bank opened 10 September 1993. It currently provides 
services to physical and juridical persons, residents, and 
nonresidents. Ruble accounts are opened only for subsequent 
conversion into hard currency. Client rubles are converted at 
the St. Petersburg Currency Exchange or within the bank. The 
charge for conversion at the currency exchange is 1 percent, but 
this may be reduced in certain instances (for major clients). 
Conversion inside the bank (according to unofficial information) 
costs the client 2 percent. The bank does not operate with cash 
rubles. 
  Bank officials refused to provide information as to the 
exact 
number of clients. They noted, however, that the bank is not 
experiencing any shortage. The bank does virtually no business 
extending credits to clients. A client may be issued credit only 
under the guarantee of a Western bank, a deposit to a bank of 
the BNP-DB network against the extension of credit, or the 
guarantee of the parent company in the West (for affiliate 
structures of foreign companies in Russia).

  A subsidiary bank of Societe Generale, Societe Generale 
Russie began operations on 8 November 1994 [as published]. Some 
35 people work in the bank, including seven foreigners. Bank 
clients presently include about 10 major international companies 
in France, Great Britain, Japan, and the United States (names 
are not divulged). The bank does not currently provide services 
to residents. Societe Generale Russie is tied into the SWIFT 
system. In the spring the bank will move to a new office on 
Belinskaya Street, augment its staff, and expand its sphere of 
activity. It provides settlement-account servicing for clients 
and accepts deposits for terms of at least 30 days and amounts 
of at least $100,000 (the interest rate paid on deposits is 
somewhat lower than the LIBOR rate). Terms for the conduct of 
exchange transactions with cash and noncash currency are the 
subject of special agreements with clients.

<H5>  Bank of China (Bank of China in Russia) </H5>
  Bank of China in Russia is a branch bank of the state 
Chinese 
bank, Bank of China. In addition to Bank of China (75.4 percent 
of the charter fund), the shareholders of Bank of China in 
Russia are two Hong Kong banks--Sin Hua Bank Ltd. and Kincheng 
Banking Corp. (24.6 percent). Both these banks belong to the 
group Bank of China. The bank's charter fund amounts to $10 
million. The bank obtained a license from the Central Bank in 
April 1993 and actually began operations in November of that 
year. About 20 persons are presently employed at the bank, most 
of whom are Chinese. 
  By the end of January 1994 the bank had about 100 clients, 
of 
whom approximately half were physical persons--mainly Chinese 
residing in Russia. Chinese companies doing business in Russia 
and joint enterprises with the participation of Chinese capital 
also predominate among those clients comprising juridical 
persons. Soon the bank intends to expand its clientele and 
operate more intensively with Russian companies and citizens. 
  Transactions involving cash currency are not yet very 
widespread. Interest is presently not being accrued in deposit 
accounts because of the unprofitability of banking operations. 
The bank has not yet officially begun transactions in Russian 
rubles. At the request of clients, however, the ruble proceeds 
of Chinese companies are converted to freely convertible 
currency. Bank of China in Russia is not yet tied into the SWIFT 
system, but it is linked with the extensive network of branches 
of Bank of China throughout the world.

  This is the last of the foreign banks to begin operations in 
Russia. Citibank T/O Moscow is a subsidiary bank of the very 
large American bank Citibank. An inaugural ceremony marked the 
opening of the bank on 14 January 1994. The directors of the 
Moscow Citibank have often stated their intention to include 
residents of Russia within their clientele, but the already 
mentioned presidential edict does not yet provide the bank such 
an opportunity. In the words of Citibank T/O Moscow 
representatives, the amount of bank commission is established 
for each specific instance during negotiations with the client.

  The group of strong foreign banks now operating in Russia 
will be joined in 1994 by another six or seven banks. The joint 
Russian-Turkish Yapi TOKO Bank will soon begin operations. ING 
Bank will open around April of this year, and Chase Manhattan 
Bank--in May. Also beginning operations in Russia in the spring 
is the bank Credit Suisse (bank officials were presently unable 
to give a more precise date). The time frames for opening ABN 
Amro Bank (the Netherlands), the Russian-Turkish bank in Moscow, 
and a branch of Postipankki OY (Finland) in St. Petersburg have 
not yet been determined.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bagrov: "Oleg Soskovets Meets With </F>
Japanese Bankers. Russian Government Wants Foreign Credit Only 
Under Its Own Conditions"] 
  [Text] The Russian Government intends to put an end 
to the practice of past years and take a firmer stand regarding 
the so-called "tied" credit granted by state export-import banks 
of foreign countries. This conclusion can be drawn from the 
negotiations that took place yesterday among First Deputy Prime 
Minister Oleg Soskovets, Central Bank Chairman Viktor 
Gerashchenko, Minister of Economics Aleksandr Shokhin, and 
representatives of the Japanese Export-Import Bank and the 
Mitsui Corporation. 
  "Tied" credit was an extremely popular form of foreign 
borrowing for a long time--mainly because of the obvious 
advantage for the creditor country. This is explained by the 
fact that almost all the funds granted to Russia were ultimately 
spent on paying for products or services in the country that 
granted the credit (Russia was also obligated to pay interest on 
this credit). Moreover, for Western bankers the guarantees from 
the Russian Government were also extremely attractive. They 
eliminated all the commercial risks of such credit (in the words 
of Aleksandr Shokhin, the former Governments of the USSR and 
Russia gave these guarantees in an amount of $9 billion). The 
Russian Government managed to achieve "independence" of credit 
from the U.S. Export-Import Bank for the first time last 
summer--"oil credit" was granted without government guarantees. 
But they did not manage to get rid of the other essential 
shortcoming--the actual support of American machine building 
(through obligations to place orders only in the United States). 
  The delegation from the Japanese Export-Import Bank, headed 
by Vice President Makoto Sunagawa, imposed much stricter 
conditions, which can even be called political. In addition to 
government guarantees for two projects--modernization of the 
Yaroslavl Nefteorgsintez Association and the creation of a 
Transsiberian telecommunications system (overall cost of $3 
million)--the Japanese made further cooperation conditional on 
Russia's fulfillment of agreements with the IMF and the Paris 
Club of creditor countries. 
  This position was completely unsuitable to the Russian side: 
In the words of Oleg Soskovets, for Russia "there is no point in 
giving government guarantees for commercial, paid projects." The 
government, in the words of the economics minister, is prepared 
to guarantee the Yaroslavl Plant unchanging export quotas 
assigned for this project and to exempt it from payment of 
customs duties. Additionally, the technical and economic 
justifications for the projects considerably dampened the 
government's enthusiasm--according to Russian figures, 85 
percent of the equipment was to be purchased from Japan and the 
rest of it from third countries. (Makoto Sunagawa, to be sure, 
sees this ratio differently: 55 percent in Japan and 45 percent 
in third countries but not Russia.) 
  Taking into account this polarity in the initial positions 
of 
the parties, one can say that the negotiations ended in a 
"draw," or, to look at them from practical positions, nothing. 
The Japanese confirmed their participation in two projects and 
the Russians, stating for the sake of argument that the local 
market could be taken up by Americans, convinced the bank 
leaders to do clarification work with their government and get 
them to back off from the strict linkage between credit and 
Russia's agreements with the IMF and the Paris Club.

<F P=106> [Article by Nelli Shmakova: "New Plan for Distribution of </F>
Export Orders. Exporters of Strategic Raw Material Will 
Determine Competition"] 
  [Text] The latest measures in the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations show that the ministry leaders are 
consistently changing from administrative methods of regulating 
foreign economic activity to market mechanisms. This pertains 
not so much to the expansion of the practice of conducting 
bidding for the distribution of orders for the delivery of raw 
material for state needs as it does to the complete replacement 
of the administrative method for distribution of all state 
orders with the competition method. In particular, beginning 1 
January of this year the distribution of state orders for 
exports of petroleum, petroleum products, and nonferrous 
metals--the most important items of state exports--will be 
conducted only according to the results of the competition. At a 
conference held yesterday in the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations they named organizations that had passed the 
competitive selection. The winners will be able to begin export 
deliveries of petroleum products after the list is approved by 
leaders of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations. 
  The distribution of state orders conducted in keeping with 
the new procedure should not be confused with federal trading 
sessions for the distribution of export quotas conducted by the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. At these, as a rule, 
they place one-time orders or orders that are limited to a short 
period of time for fulfillment. In the former case this pertains 
to making deliveries for a year. 
  The plan for conducting the competition is the same for all 
kinds of raw materials. According to it, the competition is 
conducted by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and, at least at first, 
only organizations that have traditionally fulfilled the state 
order or participants in last year's bidding organized by the 
foreign economic department may participate in it. Participants 
in the competition must submit to the Ministry of Finance the 
calculated effectiveness of the forthcoming export 
operations--in other words, indicate the quantity of currency 
that will be transferred into the budget per unit of commodity. 
If all other conditions are equal, this criterion will be the 
decisive one. Additionally, the competitors will be required to 
submit a schedule of payments backed up by bank guarantees of 
meeting the indicated time periods for receiving the amount of 
the first payment. If the schedule is not met, a fine is 
collected from the exporter in the amount of the bank 
guarantees. But they are allowed to adjust both the payment 
deadlines and the payment amounts--in the event of force majeure 
circumstances or a change in conditions in the world and 
domestic markets. As for exporters who will be making deliveries 
of fuel oil and diesel fuel for state needs in 1994, so far 
there are only 17 of these organizations. 
  [begin box] 
<H5>  Commentary from the Department of Economic Policy </H5>
  In the system for competitive distribution of state export 
quotas in 1994 there were higher and lower leagues. In the lower 
league the bidding sessions being conducted are the same as in 
1993. In the higher league, where the role of the main 
arbitrator will be played by the Ministry of Finance and where 
the winners of the bidding from last year and this year will be 
included, much larger quotas are being distributed. Thus 23.4 
million tonnes of oil credited to state export quotas have 
already been distributed among six organizations. The specific 
feature of the new model is that in it we have managed to 
coordinate the functions of the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations and the Ministry of Finance (in the past it was the 
conflicting interests of these departments that reduced the 
results of the bidding sessions). The division of labor looks 
like this: The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations determines 
the group of participants and the Ministry of Finance evaluates 
their proposals from the standpoint of maximizing budget 
currency receipts and hands down a final verdict. 
  If the new system for regulating exports, which continues 
the 
policy of liberalization of foreign economic activity, is 
approved, it, along with the unraveling currency control, could 
make the institution of specialized exporters superfluous.

"Attempt Made To Accuse Lukoyl of Nonpayments to American 
Partners"] 
  [Text] Last week the Southern District Court of Texas 
suspended the case on a complaint brought by Frankenburg Est. 
(Liechtenstein) and Frankenburg Inc. against the Russian oil 
company Lukoyl. According to American legislation, a private 
company cannot file a suit against a state company. This is 
exactly what Lukoyl is--the state has the controlling block of 
shares. Lukoyl is inclined to believe that the very fact that 
the suit was filed with the court in January 1994 is an attempt 
to discredit the company in international oil circles. 
  Lukoyl severed its relations with the Frankenburg Est. 
company as far back as 1992 on the expiration of the contract 
period, without any claims against each other. Besides 
Frankenburg Est., the Canadian firm Calgary Overseas in the PO 
[production association] Kogalymneftegaz was engaged in the 
repair of wells, and is continuing this work to this day. Lukoyl 
did not at all suspect the existence of Frankenburg Inc., the 
other company mentioned. The appearance now of negative articles 
in the Western press about the largest Russian oil company, 
according to a statement by Aleksandr Vasilenko, chief of the 
public relations office, is attributed by the Lukoyl leadership 
to the reluctance of Western and American oil companies to have 
the Russian firm participate in the development of the Azeri and 
Shirak oil fields on the shelf of the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan. 
  It is well known that a protocol on intentions to develop 
these fields was signed in November of last year between the 
Government of Azerbaijan and a consortium of oil companies of 
the United States and Great Britain, and in February of this 
year a contract is supposed to be signed on the start of this 
work on the Caspian shelf. The reserve of oil in these fields is 
estimated at 50 million tonnes. The fields are considered the 
most attractive on the territory of the former Union. And the 
fact that the Russian firm laid claim to the development of 
these fields even earlier, during Elchibey's time, was no secret 
to anyone in the international oil market. It seems that 
Azerbaijan's turn toward Russia with Aliyev's coming to power 
compelled foreign claimants to Azerbaijan oil to be on guard. 
They, of course, would like to play a more significant role in 
the oil business of the former USSR. 
  The moral costs incurred by Lukoyl from the "organized" 
scandal (this is what the company thinks) are obvious. However, 
it is hardly likely that it will be deprived of a significant 
share of the oil fields on the Caspian shelf. The final word on 
who will participate in the developments, and how, belongs to 
the Government of Azerbaijan, which is favorably disposed toward 
Lukoyl and which is headed by Vagit Alekperov, an Azeri by 
nationality and a former deputy minister of the oil industry of 
the USSR. Trust in Lukoyl is also reinforced by the strong 
support of this independent oil company by the Russian 
leadership, which is of no small importance for official 
Azerbaijan under the current political and economic conditions 
in which the republic finds itself. 
  Lukoyl, laying claim to its share of participation in the 
consortium, is not going there with empty hands. It opens up for 
all its participants the possibility of transporting the 
extracted oil through the Friendship oil pipeline, or through 
the Novorossiysk port--until the new export pipeline proposed by 
Turkey is built. According to the estimates of experts, the new 
project will cost $1.4 billion. It would be cheaper to take 
advantage of the proposal of the Russian company. 
  Lukoyl's claims to Azerbaijani oil have aroused the concerns 
of Western oil companies. As has also, moreover, its activeness 
on the world oil market. Already this year Lukoyl will begin 
research and development of oil fields on the Tunis part of the 
Mediterranean shelf. The right to development was granted Lukoyl 
by the Italian company ENI, which has a license for this, in 
exchange for the oil and gas bearing sectors of Western Siberia. 
Lukoyl forces are also planning to begin exploitation of oil 
fields in southern Egypt.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Agapov: "Conflict in Maritime Kray: The </F>
Fight for the Control Over `Nakhodka' Has Intensified"] 
  [Text] After implementation of the Law "On Customs 
Tariffs" last year, the Nakhodka Free Economic Zone (FEZ), just 
like other free economic zones, virtually lost its status. 
Nevertheless, the fight for control over this region has 
intensified sharply of late. The reason for this is the 
departure of Igor Ustinov from the post of chairman of the 
administrative committee (AC) of the Nakhodka FEZ after his 
election as a deputy to the State Duma of Russia. With the aim 
of not permitting the appointment of Aleksandr Kotikov, the 
director of the department of investments of the administrative 
committee, to the position of FEZ manager, the city 
administration accused Ustinov's "team" of corruption and 
incompetence. In this connection, a regular commission of the 
Maritime administration of the tax service yesterday initiated a 
check on the financial activity of the FEZ administrative 
committee. 
  [begin boxed item] 
<H5>  Economic Potential of the Nakhodka FEZ </H5>
  --four ice-free ports 
  --70 percent of the port capacities of the Far East 
  --50 percent of the port capacities of Russia 
  --20 percent of the export-import operations of Russia 
  --272 joint enterprises 
  --48 enterprises with 100 percent foreign capital 
  --$128 million of foreign investments 
  --2,000 new enterprises in two years 
  [end boxed item] 
  The Nakhodka FEZ today can be characterized as a zone of 
clashes of interests of a whole number of major corporate and 
authoritative Russian and foreign structures. Among them are the 
city and kray administrations, a consortium of South Korean and 
American firms, and large international and interregional 
associations and corporations associated with them. However, the 
former unity in lobbying for governmental decrees and laws 
necessary for the development of the FEZ, which has continued 
over the course of two years, changed to tough confrontation 
after everyone was faced with the need to determine the 
candidate to the post of chairman of the administrative 
committee--in other words, to decide the question concerning to 
whom in these influential groups the FEZ leadership will belong. 
  As early as last year the Nakhodka administration took 
specific steps for the purpose of replacing the functioning 
administrative committee of the FEZ and removing Igor Ustinov 
from the job. Thus, Viktor Gnezdilov, head of the Nakhodka city 
administration, sent a letter to the apparatus of the president 
and the Council of Ministers in which Ustinov was accused of 
"wrecking work" and "corruption." The result of this step was a 
whole series of financial and tax inspections of the activity of 
the administrative committee. Despite the fact that the 
operating commissions did not confirm cases of violation of 
financial and tax discipline, a commission of the Maritime Kray 
tax service office began another check on the activity of the 
FEZ administrative committee. 
  The absence of cases of violation in the activity of the 
"Ustinov" administrative committee can only indicate that the 
usual fight for control over the activity of commercial 
structures was going on, including with the participation of 
foreign capital. The fight between various groups reached its 
apogee after Igor Ustinov relinquished his authority in 
connection with his election as deputy of the State Duma. The 
vacated position was most realistically vied for by Aleksandr 
Kotikov (director of the department of investments of the FEZ 
administrative committee), Sergey Dudnik (general director of 
the Nakhodkagrazhdanstroy), and Gennadiy Ukrainchenko (first 
deputy mayor of the city of Nakhodka), who represented the 
interests of various authoritative and corporate groups. 
  As a result of a series of negotiations, the opposing sides 
were unable to reach an agreement, and the tension only mounted. 
Then followed the removal of the candidacy of Gennadiy 
Ukrainchenko, with the subsequent concurrence of Sergey Dudnik 
to subordinate the administrative committee of the FEZ to the 
city authorities in the event he is appointed its head. The next 
step was the adoption last week of a joint decision of the city 
administrations of Nakhodka and Partizansk concerning the 
appointment of Sergey Dudnik to the post of chairman of the 
administrative committee. Thus Ustinov's "team" suffered a 
defeat. 
  The most negative result of this collision can be considered 
the fact that the interest of the city authorities in the future 
development of Nakhodka as a free economic zone was replaced by 
an apparatus fight for authority over the territory. The 
previous administration of the zone planned to return privileges 
to FEZ enterprises on the basis of conferring on it the new 
status of a "free economic territory." The draft decree on the 
experiment, which was calculated for 10 years, was developed by 
experts of the government and the former Supreme Soviet of 
Russia jointly with representatives of the administrative 
committee of the Nakhodka FEZ. In accordance with the draft, the 
territory could acquire a single governing organ and a single 
legislative authority consisting of representatives of the two 
cities and one agricultural rayon. However, as recent events 
have shown, the local administration does not intend to share 
authority in a region subordinate to it with some other organ of 
administration. In principle, this kind of position fully 
satisfies the federal departments, mainly the Ministry of 
Finance and the state tax service. The fact is that in the event 
of the appearance of an independent organ of administration on 
the territory of the FEZ (as this was before with the 
administrative committee of the Nakhodka FEZ), the enterprises, 
under whose aegis they are established, are granted tax 
benefits, and problems would arise with the receipt of taxes in 
the full amount. However, when everything is lumped into a 
common city pot, it is very difficult to show who is exempt from 
taxes and who is not. A precedent can serve as an example, when 
the regional tax service after the adoption of the Law "On the 
Customs Tariff" demanded from all joint enterprises operating on 
the territory of the FEZ payment of the full amount of taxes for 
two years in the sum of 2.5 billion rubles [R]. In addition, the 
favorable tax system that operated for joint enterprises before 
the adoption of the law was not taken into consideration. The 
recent events in Nakhodka have already led to concrete results: 
Work has been stopped in the government on the "free economic 
territory" project, and many foreign investors have postponed 
negotiations on investment projects for an indefinite period.

<F P=106> [Report by Yana Mirontseva: "Creation of Joint-Stock Company </F>
Envisaged for Deposit Development: Controversy Over Sukhoy Log 
Deposit"] 
  [Text] The controversy surrounding the Sukhoy Log 
gold deposit in Irkutsk Oblast has been going on for almost two 
years. By most modest estimates, at least six participants have 
been involved in it: the city of Bodaybo administration, the 
Irkutsk Oblast administration, the Lenzoloto AO [joint-stock 
company], Roskomdragmet [Russian Federation Committee on 
Precious Metals and Precious Stones], Roskomnedr [Russian 
Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral 
Resources], and the Australian company Star Technology System. 
Nevertheless, there is hope that one of the largest gold 
deposits in the world will be under development soon: Lenzoloto 
AO General Director Valentin Avlov proposed to set up a 
privately held joint-stock company especially for the 
development of Sukhoy Log. During the general director's visit 
to Moscow, which he completed yesterday, he succeeded in 
obtaining preliminary approval from federal authorities for the 
creation of the joint-stock company. 
  Sukhoy Log is the largest undeveloped gold deposit in 
the world (estimated reserves--1,000 tonnes). It is located in 
the vicinity of the city of Bodaybo in Irkutsk Oblast. 
  Let us recall the history of the conflict: The conversion of 
Lenzoloto PO [industrial association] into Lenzoloto AO 
proceeded in keeping with the government decision dated 9 April 
1992. In the text of the document things were not made clear 
regarding the participation of foreign capital, as well as 
Lenzoloto AO's succession rights to "use of land and other 
natural resources," which are in conflict with legislative acts 
adopted later--in particular, the law on mineral resources. 
Therefore, Roskomnedr does not recognize as legitimate 
Lenzoloto's license to develop the Sukhoy Log deposit. All 
materials on the subject were recently submitted for 
consideration to the Ministry of Justice. If the ministry finds 
Lenzoloto's license illegitimate, the deposit will be put up for 
bid. 
  Another violation was committed in signing the agreement in 
keeping with which the Australian company will begin financing 
of development after geological information on Sukhoy Log 
deposit is declassified. Last week a state commission of the 
presidential administration's control administration worked in 
Bodaybo. As the commission's head, control administration 
department chief Aleksandr Lapenkov, put it, "removing the 
'secret' designation is a very serious matter, and it is unclear 
who will take responsibility for it, since distribution of this 
information may influence the world price of gold and thus 
damage Russian interests in this market." Because of this, 
Lenzoloto AO cannot get money from its foreign founder. 
According to information in KOMMERSANT's possession, on 15 
December 1993 at a conference in Yegor Gaydar's office a 
decision was made to remove the "secret" designation; however, 
at this point there is no official confirmation of this. 
  According to preliminary information, the presidential 
administration commission and the Irkutsk Oblast administration 
are inclined to accept the compromise solution proposed by 
Lenzoloto AO General Director Valentin Avlov. Which is the 
following: Since the conversion of Lenzoloto PO into Lenzoloto 
AO has already taken place, let it continue to operate. To 
develop the Sukhoy Log deposit, a new privately held AO will be 
created with the participation of Lenzoloto AO, Minatom 
[Ministry of Atomic Energy], the Irkutsk Oblast administration, 
and other interested enterprises. This proposal was also 
accepted by top officials in Roskomdragmet, Roskomnedr, and the 
State Committee for Administration of State Property, with whom 
Mr. Avlov conducted negotiations during his visit to Moscow. 
This raises hopes that the conflict will be resolved very soon.

<F P=106> [Report by Yevgeniy Ostapov: "Yak's Will Invade the World </F>
Market Through Asia: Hyundai-Yak Company Ltd. Joint Venture Has 
Begun Operations"] 
  [Text] Negotiations were completed yesterday between 
top officials of the Experimental Design Bureau Imeni A.S. 
Yakovleva AO [joint-stock company] and representatives of the 
South Korean corporation Hyundai. At the negotiations, which for 
the first time were being conducted within the framework of the 
Hyundai-Yak Aerospace Company Ltd. SP [joint venture], a deal 
was made to sell to the Korean side three Yak-112 aircraft. For 
all practical purposes this deal became the beginning of 
operations of the first joint venture in Russia between a 
Russian aviation design bureau and a foreign partner. 
  The Hyundai-Yak Aerospace Company Ltd. was created at 
the end of last year (KOMMERSANT reported on the progress of 
negotiations in its issue dated 24 November 1993). Hyundai owns 
51 percent of the SP stock; however, most seats on the board of 
directors belong to the Russian side. In the implementation of 
joint projects, Yakovlev Design Bureau gains access to Hyundai 
technologies and finances. The South Korean corporation Hyundai 
(gross sales in 1993--$56 billion), which has representations in 
more than 160 countries, will make its distribution and service 
network available to the SP. 
  After Hyundai specialists complete work on interior 
finishing 
of aircraft cabins using automotive industry technologies, the 
South Korean side will begin marketing Yakovlev products in the 
West. The four-seat Yak-112 aircraft, produced in passenger, 
training, medical, and multipurpose versions, and also equipped 
with float chassis, completely meets international standards of 
fitness to fly. 
  In addition, a decision was made that Hyundai-Yak Aerospace 
Company Ltd. will in the near future introduce in the 
Asia-Pacific market two new aircraft developed by Yakovlev 
Bureau--a two-seat sports Yak-54 and a six-seat Yak-58. The 
aircraft are equipped with Western-made engines, which reduces 
their operational costs and makes them more attractive to 
potential foreign buyers. 
  The SP intends to expand its sphere of activities, not 
limiting itself to bilateral cooperation. According to Aleksandr 
Dondukov, chairman of the board of Experimental Design Bureau 
Imeni A.S. Yakovleva AO, there are very good prospects in 
cooperation between Hyundai-Yak Aerospace Company Ltd. and the 
Italian company Aermacchi in the area of so-called dual-use 
technology, which may be used for both military and civilian 
purposes. The Yak-130 training jet aircraft was selected as the 
basis for joint work with Aermacchi. A rather important factor 
is that this aircraft does not fall under the program of 
reductions of conventional arms in Europe and therefore has 
quite good market prospects. 
  KOMMERSANT experts note that Russian aviation technology's 
entry into the world market through the "Asian door" at this 
point probably represents the most realistic solution. Currently 
Russian military aviation design bureaus either do not plan at 
all or are at the stage of only considering the possibility of 
setting up an SP. Somewhat of an exception is the cooperation 
between the MiG Design Bureau and the French aviation engine 
builder SNESMA regarding equipping MiG-AT training aircraft with 
the Larzac power system. However, the partners have not yet 
considered setting up an SP.

<F P=106> [Report by MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI staff correspondent Viktor </F>
Kiyanitsa: "The Right of Way"] 
  [Text] The election campaign to the new Supreme 
Council was officially launched in Kazakhstan last week. From 
the very first days of a month-long election marathon, the pulse 
of public life quickened perceptibly--which, strangely enough, 
has not found an adequate reflection in the local mass 
media. 
  Television in Kazakhstan is not flooded with ads 
proclaiming, 
"Better with us than with Snickers." Newspapers are not filling 
their pages with candidates' endless political platforms. It 
appears that the Central Electoral Commission has learned from 
the sad experience of the Russian campaign. Paid political 
advertising is banned. All candidates are in equal starting 
conditions: Each is entitled to 10 minutes of free television 
time and 100 lines in the republic press to present his program. 
But this is not the only reason of the relatively low political 
activism of the press. Paradoxical as it may sound, it is quite 
often busy with things other than big politics. Most daily 
newspapers in the republic come out three times a week lately. 
And some are suspending publication altogether. There is no 
paper, no money for printing and delivery--a difficult economic 
situation. The republic leadership untiringly emphasizes that in 
Kazakhstan, where more than 500 periodicals are registered, 
there has not been a single incident of a "coerced" closing of a 
newspaper. Only "natural mortality" as a result of economic 
difficulties. What is interesting, however, is that it is 
primarily the state and quasi-state mass media that had been 
suffering most from economic difficulties. The very large 
newspaper KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA--a former Central Committee 
organ--finished last year "owing" the readers about 30 issues, 
although one would think that it should feel itself in a 
privileged position, having as a cofounder--along with the labor 
collective--the Cabinet of Ministers. The mighty cofounder, 
however, reminds of its existence mostly only after another 
"unpleasant" article, when the newspaper is duly reminded that 
it is a state organ and must defend state interests! 
  One of the latest such reminders was an official letter to 
the editor in chief from the republic's Ministry of Publishing 
and Mass Media. Among other things, it contains a list of 
subjects which, in the ministry's opinion, "may constitute" 
state secrets. The list is long and not very comprehensible. 
Some items in it simply contradict current legislation. For 
instance, "it is not recommended" to reveal data on the state 
gold reserves. At the same time, the law on the monetary system 
prescribes the National Bank to issue at least once a month 
information on the gold and foreign currency supply that 
supports the tenga. Actually, this is not even a full list. No 
one in the editorial offices has seen the full one. The 
newspaper's senior management reminiscences almost wistfully 
about the times of Glavlit [the Main Administration for 
Safeguarding State Secrets in the Press], when each editor had 
in his safe a list of items that constituted state secrets. Now 
the ministry suggests: "Call for guidance before publishing...." 
  More often, however, the ministry itself takes the 
initiative 
in calling and advising. They may recommend that some or other 
rubric be started, to "cover a topic." There was an incident 
when the newspaper was "advised" to put a certain headline in 
the next issue.... According so some data--so far unofficial--a 
draft for creating some sort of state-owned "press holding 
company" is in the works in the bowels of the administrative 
structures. The state will own the controlling share of stock 
and will thus get a real lever of managing newspapers' policy as 
well as the ability to appoint and remove editors in chief. 
Actually, even today the logogriph "independent newspaper" on 
the front page does not guarantee complete independence from the 
state. Just recently, Dauir, the largest publishing house in the 
republic, where many "independent" newspapers are printed, 
refused to print about 30 of them with the lowest circulation. 
The pretext for refusal was that several presses needed 
preventive maintenance. By strange coincidence, "preventive 
maintenance" coincided with the beginning of the election 
campaign. 
  The list of "low-circulation" newspapers included the 
popular 
KARAVAN newspaper, with a circulation of 200,000. This happened 
after KARAVAN and the businessmen's newspaper ABC published a 
very biting open letter from the president of Krands--the 
largest state corporation--to the mayor of the capital. On the 
day this issue came out, the city fire inspectorate sealed the 
printing house facilities. Later, electricity was cut off there 
several times.... 
  Someone wants very much literally to implement the famous 
journalistic postulate: A newspaper's life is one day.

<F P=106> [Article in three installments by N.K. Kayumov, director of </F>
the Economic Research Institute of the Republic of Tajikistan 
Ministry of Economics: "Can the Ailment Be Alleviated?"] 
<H5>  [11 Dec p 2] </H5>
  [Text] The economy of Tajikistan is today experiencing a 
profound and protracted crisis, which is a consequence of a 
number of objective and subjective processes that have developed 
in the republic in recent years. The severance of economic 
relations and the winding down of turnover between the 
Commonwealth of Independent States and the former socialist 
countries have had a particularly devastating impact. The crisis 
in which the republic's economy has found itself in connection 
also with the civil war, political instability, and natural 
disasters has proven far deeper and of greater proportions than 
it appeared earlier. In addition, the economy of Tajikistan 
inherited from the former Union a low efficiency of production 
with its hypertrophied structure, which in far from all 
instances had wide-ranging production relations with other 
countries. The most striking evidence of this has been the 
intensifying slump in production. In the past three years the 
republic's economy has in terms of many general economic 
indicators been thrown back almost 30 years. Whereas in 1991 
generated national income in comparable prices declined 8.4 
percent compared with 1990, in 1992 it had declined 31 percent. 
Industrial output in 1990-1992 declined 24.3 percent, and in six 
months of the present year, 30.5 percent. The agricultural 
product in the period 1990-1992 declined 47 percent and 
corresponds to the 1976 level. 
  From which it may be concluded that Tajikistan's economic 
situation will continue to deteriorate since the factors 
contributing to the extrication of the economy from the state of 
crisis have not yet begun to operate. 
  Mutually non-concerted actions, particularly of former 
republics of the Union which are large and better-off in terms 
of mineral and raw material resources, on questions of pricing, 
inconsistency in the implementation of economic reforms, and 
flagrant mistakes in the methods of its [as published] 
implementation under the conditions of the common ruble zone 
have led to chaos and paralysis of the economic organism of many 
states of the Commonwealth. The foundations of the credit and 
monetary system have been thoroughly undermined. The 
liberalization of prices without a restructuring of the 
necessary accompanying levers of their regulation has not been 
an effective stimulus of an increase in production, or the 
increase in pay, a factor of highly productive labor. The loss 
of the state's regulating function and the granting of the 
enterprises broad rights in respect to formation of the 
labor-remuneration fund have led to the use of profit for the 
needs of consumption to the detriment of accumulation. 
  Social tension in society is intensifying. The price rises 
have been on a considerably larger scale than anticipated. As a 
result the quality of life and the living standard of almost all 
strata of the populace, its socially unprotected part 
particularly, are deteriorating sharply. A polarization of 
society--the impoverishment of the bulk of it and the enrichment 
of a small part of it--is taking place. The shadow economy is 
assuming greater proportions. 
  Many branches of the economy, primarily its agrarian sector, 
are lacking the necessary fuel and energy resources. The 
shortage of food resources and Tajikistan's dependence on 
supplies thereof from outside are creating a real danger for the 
normal physical development of the populace. 
  The main task at present is restoration of the national 
economy and a halt to the continued recession. The republic's 
potential does not permit the rapid restoration of what has been 
demolished. We need to determine the priority facilities and 
begin the restoration with the priorities. Priority measures are 
needed simultaneously to avert a further decline in production 
in all sectors of the economy. These measures should be devised 
on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the state of the 
republic's economy in recent years. 
  The decline in industrial production in the republic, which 
began in 1990, was initially of a structural nature. It was 
connected, in the main, with the reduction in production in the 
fuel sector and construction materials industry. As of 1992 this 
slump has become general. The greatest decline in production has 
occurred in the base and processing sectors. The decline in 
production in 1991 constituted 3.6 percent compared with 1990, 
and in 1992, 24.3 percent. In three years the industrial product 
in comparable prices declined 26.7 percent and corresponds to 
the 1980 level. There was a deterioration in the level and 
dynamics of the industrial efficiency indicators: productivity, 
capital-output ratio, and materials consumption. A particularly 
difficult situation has taken shape in the fuel sector. In the 
period 1990-1992 production of oil declined by 83,000 tonnes 
(57.6 percent), gas, by 39 million cubic meters (35.1 percent), 
and coal, by 259,000 tonnes (54.5 percent). In terms of the 
production of oil and gas the republic has been thrown back to 
the level of 1940. Although the generation of electric power is 
being held at the same level, in 1992 it declined by 1.3 billion 
kilowatt-hours (7.2 percent). Under the conditions of the 
ever-growing shortage of fuel and energy resources and the 
uncontrolled increase in their price, this state of the sector 
is having a ruinous effect on the republic's economy. 
  The machine-building sector is in the same position also. 
Half as many transformers were manufactured in 1992 as in 1965, 
and their production constituted 18.5 percent of the 1990 level. 
  Construction materials industry is in a state of profound 
crisis. On account of the shortage of reinforcing steel, the 
increase in the price of energy, and the increased cost of the 
shipment of the finished product, many enterprises of the sector 
are in a grim financial condition. Some 620,000 fewer tonnes of 
cement (58.1), 92.7 million fewer standard tiles of 
asbestos-cement sheet (76.3 percent), 802,000 fewer cubic meters 
of precast ferroconcrete structures and products (75.1 percent), 
and 179 million fewer standard building bricks (60.1 percent) 
were manufactured in 1992 compared with 1990. Some 2.1 times 
less cement and 1.5 times fewer ferroconcrete structures and 
products were produced in 1992 than in 1960, and the production 
of asbestos-cement sheet was at the 1960 level. This situation 
is preventing the accomplishment of the task of restoration of 
the economy and demands special consideration and the adoption 
of specific measures for stabilization of the sector itself. 
  An extremely inauspicious situation is shaping up on the 
consumer market. The volume of retail commodity turnover and 
payable services, which has increased many times over in current 
prices, does not reflect the actual picture of the level of 
satisfaction of consumer requirements. According to official 
data, the rate of the production of consumer goods in 1992 
declined 28 percent compared with 1991, which was several points 
more than for the republic's industry on average. The 
manufacture of household refrigerators declined here by 105,600 
(63.3 percent), cotton cloth, by 64 million square meters (52.5 
percent), silk cloth, by 10 million square meters (13.2 
percent), carpets and carpeting, by 2.5 million square meters 
(22.9 percent), socks and hose, by 20.5 million pairs (34.3 
percent), knitwear, by 7.8 million items (49.7 percent), 
footwear, by 5.6 million pairs (51.4 percent), meat and meat 
products, 41,900 tonnes (84.8 percent), sausage products, by 
12,000 tonnes (77.9 percent), whole milk products, by 66,000 
tonnes (34 percent), butter, by 2,700 tonnes (45 percent), and 
confectionery, by 41,500 tonnes (77.9 percent) in 1990-1992. A 
decline in the production of consumer goods in physical terms 
occurred in other groups also. 
<H5>  [18 Dec p 2] </H5>
  [Text] In terms of the production of household 
refrigerators the republic has been thrown back 26 years, of 
cloth, 12-17 years, footwear and knitwear, 20-25 years, carpets 
and carpeting, 13 years, and socks and hose, six years. The 
production of cultural and welfare facilities and household 
commodities has declined noticeably. 
  There has been a sharp deterioration in the situation in 
trade. Retail commodity turnover in comparable prices in 1992 
constituted only 27.8 percent of the 1991 level, although in 
current prices it grew by a factor of 3.2. Because of the 
increase in prices the overpayment by the public constituted 
more than R16 billion, which made the position of the republic's 
working people far worse. The increase in consumer prices 
outpaced personal monetary income by a factor of 2.5. 
  There is not only the relative but also the absolute 
impoverishment of the bulk of the population of the 
republic. 
  The systematic reduction in the supplies to retail trade of 
the basic foodstuffs is a cause of particular concern. The 
supply of meat and meat products declined 65 percent, of dairy 
products, 48 percent, sugar and confectionery, 92 percent, 
cotton cloth, 44 percent, silk cloth, 56 percent, knitwear, 40 
percent, footwear, 35 percent, and so forth in 1992 compared 
with 1991. The consumption of meat and meat products declined 
from 26 kg in 1990 to 20 kg in 1992, and of milk and dairy 
products, from 161 kg to 72 kg. 
  The increase in prices is forcing people to spend a 
large part of their family budget primarily on the purchase of 
food. The structure of the population's diet has shifted toward 
carbohydrate consumption models. Proportional spending on 
nourishment is rising systematically and at the present time 
constitutes 65 percent. 
  Consumption at the level of the physiological minimum 
enables 
a person to exist merely as a biological organism, but not to 
restore his fitness for work. A diet at this caloric level leads 
for quite a long period of time to mental and physical 
degradation. The lack of protein and fats is reflected in 
people's health and the quality of the work force, a reduction 
in life expectancy, a change in its mentality and behavior, and 
the destruction of the nation's gene pool. Unless there is 
a change in the situation, a further increase in morbidity, 
reduced immunity, and a decline in the ability to work may be 
expected in the not-too-distant future in certain underdeveloped 
regions. 
  The agrarian sector of the republic's economy has found 
itself in an extremely difficult situation. The armed conflicts, 
the complex social and political situation, the severance of 
firmly established economic relations between countries of the 
Commonwealth, the extremely unfavorable weather conditions, 
natural disasters of unprecedented scale, the incredible price 
rises, the difficulties in the purchase of equipment, fuel and 
lubricants, mineral fertilizers, herbicides, and toxic chemicals 
associated with this, and the appreciable gap between the level 
of prices of industrial and agricultural products have been 
reflected in the situation in the sector. No sector has suffered 
as much as agriculture. A further decline in agricultural 
production is occurring against the background of the shortfall 
in the sowing of a number of crops and the reduction in the 
numbers of livestock and the decline in its productiveness. 
  In 1992 the total gross product of the sector in comparable 
prices constituted 53 percent of the 1990 level. In 1991 the 
decline in production constituted only 4 percent, in 1992, 43 
percent. In terms of the production of cereals the sector has 
been thrown back to the level of 1980, of potatoes, 1981, 
vegetables, 1986, edible pumpkins, 1978, grapes, somewhat before 
1970 even, meat, 1963, milk, 1960, and eggs, 1975. Some 68,000 
tonnes fewer of cereals, 45,000 tonnes fewer of potatoes, 78,000 
tonnes fewer of fruits and berries, 108,000 tonnes fewer of 
grapes, 340,000 tonnes less of seed cotton, 60,000 fewer tonnes 
of meat, 388,000 fewer tonnes of milk, and 346 million fewer 
eggs were gathered in in 1992 compared with 1990. 
  A particularly serious situation has come about in the 
animal 
husbandry sector. The sector's resources declined appreciably 
mainly owing to the decline in the production and the 
deterioration of the indicators of productiveness of the public 
herd. Albeit small, a growth, nonetheless, in the numbers and 
production of animal husbandry products was observed on the 
private subsidiary plots. But this growth is not making up for 
the decline in public animal husbandry. 
  The most negative result of the development of public animal 
husbandry was the sharp decline in the herd. The numbers of 
cattle in the republic as a whole had declined by 157,400 head 
(30 percent), including 35,500 head of cows (25 percent), of 
hogs, by 81,700 head (66 percent), sheep and goats, 472,500 head 
(26 percent), and poultry, by 4,129,200 head (56 percent), as of 
1 August 1993 compared with 1 August 1991. 
  This situation in animal husbandry is exerting a negative 
influence on the long-term possibilities of the development of 
the sector and reducing the republic's meat resources 
appreciably. The restoration of the numbers of animals, of 
cattle particularly, will take decades. 
  There has been a simultaneous decline in the productiveness 
of livestock and poultry. The average milk yield per cow has 
declined by 612 kg (42 percent), and the yield of a laying hen, 
by 35 eggs (35 percent). 
<H5>  [30 Dec p 3] </H5>
  [Text] The shortage of feed, formula feed particularly, 
has had a noticeable effect on the state of affairs in hog 
raising and poultry breeding. The large-scale animal husbandry 
complexes and poultry factories, which are almost wholly 
dependent on supplies of formula feed, have found themselves in 
a difficult situation with the introduction of free feed prices. 
  The scale of the decline in production in the processing 
sectors of the republic's agro-industrial complex has grown 
sharply also. In 1992 enterprises of the sector manufactured 
products 25.2 percent below the 1991 level. 
  Against the background of the general decline in production 
in all sectors of the economy there has been a marked reduction 
in investment activity. The incredible growth of prices has led 
to a devaluation of the savings and working assets of the 
enterprises and organizations. As a result the scale of 
construction has declined sharply. Investments from all sources 
of financing were in 1992 one-third below the 1990 level. 
  The efficiency of the invested capital declined somewhat. 
The 
introduction of fixed capital in the first six months of 1993 
constituted only 20 percent of total capital investments. For 
this reason the amount of incomplete construction grew several 
times over compared with 1990 and constituted R40 billion. The 
above-norm increase in incomplete construction constituted 
approximately R12 billion. According to the most modest 
estimates, more than R3 billion of funds in the increase in 
incomplete construction were spent on pay. The greatest decline 
in investment activity is being observed in the sectors that 
determine the direction of structural policy. This testifies 
that the crisis has assumed not only an economic but also a 
technological nature, and there has been a marked acceleration 
in the aging and physical deterioration of fixed capital in many 
sectors of the economy, primarily in the fuel industry and the 
machine-building, iron and steel, and chemical and timber 
complexes. Depreciation allowances are not providing even for 
simple reproduction, let alone expanded reproduction. 
  The decline in production in industry, agriculture, and 
construction and the shortage of fuel and spares and other 
resources and also the significant increase in fares have led to 
a sharp deterioration in the operation of transport. The 
shipment of freight by general use transport declined by almost 
30,000 tonnes (43.8 percent) compared with 1990. 
  The republic's financial condition has taken complex shape 
also. Its budget system was formed under the impact of the 
general economic and political crisis in society. The republic's 
financial resources have essentially lost their link with real 
material production and its efficiency indicators, as a result 
of which financing has assumed a deficit nature even under the 
conditions of the application of austerity measures. Expenditure 
on wages, food, and other priority spending is being funded, in 
the main. Nonetheless, the budget deficit is not declining but, 
on the contrary, growing. The decline in production combined 
with the intensive growth of wholesale prices and the reduction 
in export receipts has led to a sharp reduction on the revenue 
side of the budget. 
  It is perfectly obvious that a resolution of the problem of 
a 
recovery of state finances will take a long time, in the course 
of which the prerequisites for this recovery have to be created. 
In this connection, evidently, the government will be forced to 
wind down the financing of the construction of production 
facilities that do not promise rapid income or do not satisfy 
the republic's most urgent requirements, end financial 
assistance from the budget to financially autonomous 
enterprises, and establish strict legal and tax control over the 
activity of commercial structures. 
  The current situation is reason to anticipate with 
sufficient 
certainty that the economic decline will continue. Even if 
measures pertaining to financial and economic stabilization are 
stepped up, their consequences will be manifested at the end of 
next year or beyond even. 
  The time has come today for a critical evaluation of the 
entire path that has been trodden, for appreciable adjustments 
to be made to the strategy and tactics of the economic reforms 
that are being implemented, and for a number of priority 
measures to halt the continued decline in production to be 
realized. The following, in our opinion, pertain to the latter: 
  First, tasks of the surmounting of the crisis 
situation in agriculture, of which support for the harvesting 
and spring-field operations is the most important, are of the 
most significance at this time. It is necessary to establish the 
strictest accounting of the propellant and fuel and lubricants 
entering the republic and to channel them first and foremost 
into the needs of agriculture. 
  Similar measures need to be implemented also in animal 
husbandry, where, owing to missed opportunities in the 
procurement of fodder, a real threat of a further sharp 
reduction in the numbers of livestock could be created. 
  It is important also that agricultural enterprises be 
supplied with spares for the repair of tractors, other 
agricultural machinery, and motor vehicles, receive some 
new-equipment replenishment, and have the necessary quantity of 
mineral fertilizers and toxic chemicals. Government support for 
the agricultural enterprises and the allocation of soft loans 
are needed for the solution of these questions. 
  It is essential also to work out the question of the 
reprofiling of a number of shops and bays of the republic's 
machine-building enterprises for the production of spares, 
parts, and components of agricultural equipment and transport 
facilities. 
  It is essential, before it is too late, to introduce 
everywhere the family contract and to make it the main form of 
production responsibility linking compensation with the end 
result of work. World and, yes, our own experience shows that 
only thus can the food problem be resolved. 
  Second. A rapid growth in offenses in the economic 
sphere causing the economy of Tajikistan considerable harm has 
been charted in recent years on account of the absence of strict 
control and the not entirely justified liberalization of foreign 
economic activity. A tremendous quantity of raw material and 
food resources, of which the republic is today itself in need, 
is being exported without hindrance, and there is little that is 
coming in in exchange. This practice is leading to an increase 
in prices and a decline in personal living standards. We are 
confronted squarely in this connection with the question of 
Tajikistan's economic security. 
  It would seem that for stabilization in the sphere of the 
economy it is essential to devise an official program for 
fighting crime, in which tough measures against the increasing 
crime-conducing processes in the economy should be realized. It 
might be considered necessary to this end to create an 
independent state control committee, adopt a package of laws on 
the fight against corruption and on the status of the public 
servant, and to determine measures of severe punishment for 
aiding and abetting the perpetration of economic crimes. It is 
essential to create under the auspices of the Committee for 
National Security a department for the fight for the republic's 
economic security. A law banning officials from engaging in 
commercial activity is needed. It is also time to wind down all 
small enterprises, cooperatives, and other commercial formations 
at state-owned enterprises. 
  Third. It is essential to devise an effective 
mechanism of the stimulation of production, introduce a sparing 
tax system, and to grant the enterprises medium-term and 
long-term loans. It would be a mistake to think that high taxes 
might reduce the budget deficit, on the contrary, they would 
suppress incentives to production and could even, having reached 
a particular level, lead to an absolute reduction in budget 
revenue and to a slowing of the rate of turnover of capital. 
This applies to value-added tax also. Throughout the world this 
tax performs the role of stimulus contributing to a reduction in 
prices, with us, however, the other way about--to an increase. 
It should be differentiated by commodity group depending on 
social significance. It is essential to stabilize the budget not 
via an increase in taxes but by way of a reduction in government 
spending and by means of the pursuit of a preferential tax 
policy. 
  Fourth. A process of the aging of the fixed 
capital of sectors of the national economy is intensifying at 
the present time. The retirement factor in fuel industry, for 
example, has today reached 55 percent, in the construction 
materials industry, 40 percent, the processing sectors, 27 
percent, the machine-building complex, 25 percent, and so forth. 
Unless serious measures are adopted today even, the fixed 
capital of many sectors will have become decrepit within five or 
six years. It is necessary, therefore, for maintenance of the 
technical level of production to revitalize enterprises' 
investment activity. The government will, evidently, have to 
reduce the funding of state capital investments to the minimum 
necessary for maintaining the viability of the systems and the 
construction of priority facilities. It is necessary to this end 
to shift the center of gravity from budget financing to the 
financially autonomous funds of the enterprises and switch from 
the funding of capital construction free of charge to bank 
loans. It is necessary to devise a mechanism of attraction of 
the resources of the banks themselves and individuals. 
  Fifth. It may be said with confidence today that 
flagrant miscalculations were made in the tactics and strategy 
of implementation of the economic reforms. We began the reform 
from the top echelons of management of the economy. The time has 
come to shift the burden of the economic transformations to the 
sphere of real production and the subjects of market 
relations--the enterprises--and to afford them broader rights 
and freedom of action so that they themselves, following the 
example of the Baltic republics, might establish direct 
relations with enterprises of the far and near abroad. 
  Sixth. There should be a strong bridge between the 
past, the present, and the future. This bridge is lacking 
currently. The directive-plan system having been demolished, 
nothing has been proposed in exchange. The reform should be 
implemented with a high degree of state regulation and the 
strictest control of the sphere of production, circulation, and 
foreign economic activity. The outstanding role of Roosevelt as 
a statesman was that he was able to turn an uncontrolled market 
economy into a controlled economy. There is no spontaneous 
economy anywhere. It is essential, therefore, before more 
follies are committed, to restore the system of state regulation 
of national economic, intersectoral, and intra-sectoral 
proportions. But this regulation should be exercised mainly on 
the basis of economic methods of management. 
  The economy of Tajikistan will not be extricated from the 
most severe and protracted economic crisis quickly. Gradual, 
consistent, and thoughtful work is needed.

<F P=106> [Interview with B. Shikhmuradov, deputy chairman of the </F>
Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan, by Eduard Zorinyants; 
place and date not given; published under the rubric "Nations 
and Foreign Countries": "We Have Our Path to Democracy. 
Turkmenistan: Post-Soviet Euphoria"] 
  [Text] Relations between the Center and the Union 
republics in the USSR have always been like those of a rider and 
a horse, thinks the deputy chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers 
of Turkmenistan, B. Shikhmuradov. In a conversation with an 
ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent he discusses the foundations of 
the politics of the young sovereign state. 
  [Zorinyants] How do you explain the fact that in 
Turkmenistan, a multinational state, where one could expect 
internal conflicts, stability still remains? 
  [Shikhmuradov] Since the first days of our independence we 
have proceeded from the conviction that the polyethnic 
(multinational) principle for formation of the state was more 
promising, and better grounded than the monoethnic one. And we 
see in this no deprecation of the national dignity of Turkmens. 
  We do not shout about the supremacy of any ethnic groups 
over 
others and we do not take the liberty of accusing some and 
turning others into victims. Having taken a realistic look at 
the events of the recent and distant past, we said to ourselves: 
All that has happened has been both good and bad--that is our 
history. And how it will continue now depends on us. Such a 
sober view of our own history has now become a foundation for 
peace and harmony in the society. 
  Of course the republic leaders still have the right to 
correct, reasonable, and timely intervention. And they take 
advantage of this right. Look, for example, at the serious 
evolution in our legislation of the article on fanning 
intertribal and interethnic dissension. At one time this 
entailed a small fine. Now fanning dissension is regarded as one 
of the gravest criminal offenses and is punished accordingly. 
  [Zorinyants] And how is the personnel policy structured? As 
far as I know, there have been fewer and fewer non-Turkmens 
recently, both in the structures of power and among the leaders 
of enterprises. 
  [Shikhmuradov] We have no national or, more precisely, 
nationalistic preferences in personnel policy. A mechanism of 
appropriateness and occupational suitability is at work here. 
Look at the entire administrative hierarchy and you will see 
representatives of all peoples. And if Turkmens still prevail, 
that is not surprising; after all, they make up 80 percent of 
the population. 
  [Zorinyants] One gets the impression that the leaders of 
Turkmenistan have some kind of cautious attitude toward the CIS. 
  [Shikhmuradov] It seems to many people that the CIS is a new 
version of the former Union, where there is a single center to 
which one can turn on any occasion. This, as we see it, is an 
incorrect view of it. In the USSR relations between the Center 
and the Union republics were always like those of a rider and a 
horse. 
  Two years of experience with the CIS have convinced us that 
even the most difficult problems in relations among states can 
and should be resolved in bilateral negotiations. As we know, 
the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. And 
the creation under the label of the CIS of any center, a strict 
coordinating structure, is a third point, which, if it does not 
distort, at least lengthens this straight line. We want to 
reserve the right to choose what is advantageous and what is 
disadvantageous based on our own national interests. 
  [Zorinyants] Whose experience would you like to emulate in 
your reforms? 
  [Shikhmuradov] We have studied various models of 
socioeconomic development and familiarized ourselves with the 
experience of Turkey, the United States, France, China, India, 
and Pakistan. And still we have created our own purely Turkmen 
model of transition to the market. It takes into account our 
country's specific features, its customs and traditions, and 
even its behavioral stereotypes. Based on this we have published 
a program called "10 Years of Well-Being." We need 10 years of 
stability and interethnic harmony in order to conduct the 
reforms more quickly. 
  During this period we must solve two 
problems--simultaneously: building an independent state and 
changing from a centralized to a market economy. And at the same 
time we shall provide social guarantees for the people so that 
the difficulties of the transition will not be reflected 
painfully among the population, as is frequently the case. 
  [Zorinyants] Judging from what I have seen, you have not 
always succeeded at the latter. The stores are rather empty. The 
main food products are bought with ration cards and the prices 
went up again after the introduction of the national currency. 
Therefore let us move from the material sphere to questions of 
spiritual life. According to the Constitution, Turkmenistan is a 
secular state, but the highest representatives of the Muslim 
clergy participate in the work of all the most important 
conferences. The president of Turkmenistan has issued an edict 
on studying the fundamentals of religion in school. Is this not 
turning out that the revival of interest in Islam is moving and 
taking hold at the top? And is this not pandering to 
fundamentalist forces? 
  [Shikhmuradov] For many long years our people were 
physically 
separated from religion even though it is a part of their 
spiritual life. And if the return to Islam seems overly active 
now, one must allow for what you might call a thirst on the part 
of a people yearning for their own customs and traditions. The 
people generate their culture, and religion is a part of it. 
  As for threats of Muslim fundamentalism, I want to say that 
Turkmens have never been religious fanatics. And such a threat 
does not exist. 
  [Zorinyants] Does the return of Islam to the spiritual life 
of society mean that the traditions associated with it will also 
be revived: polygamy, bride money, etc.? 
  [Shikhmuradov] You are talking about things that are under 
church jurisdiction. But in our country it is separated from the 
state. Therefore these questions are neither discussed nor 
resolved at the state level. 
  [Zorinyants] That is, they are not encouraged and they are 
not condemned? 
  [Shikhmuradov] The main thing is for the activity of 
religious organizations to be in keeping with the Constitution, 
and the church has obeyed the laws of the country. This more or 
less insures us against any extremes, against religious 
extremism. 
  [Zorinyants] It is known that you have retained censorship 
and that there is only one party--the democratic, formerly 
Communist Party, and the opposition has been banned. Yet 
according to its Constitution Turkmenistan is not only a secular 
but also a democratic state. So whom should we believe--the 
Constitution or real life? 
  [Shikhmuradov] Our Constitution actually does contain such a 
stipulation. But I want to emphasize that we are now at the very 
beginning of the path to a democratic society. 
  We are convinced that it is impossible to create a democracy 
overnight. It requires a certain transition period, which we are 
now going through. It is impossible to jump from totalitarianism 
to a free society in a single hour. Whenever we begin to agitate 
the unpoliticized masses, where does it lead? The politicians 
remain sitting in their offices and the people on the streets 
shed blood. It is our duty to spare people from such things. 
Therefore the principle of moderation and weighed steps in 
conducting democratic transformation is fundamental for us. 
  We are now being accused of not having a multiparty system. 
No, we will not permit it just so that we can be called 
democrats because we are to responsive to our people's choice! 
  I want to emphasize that democracy is our ultimate goal. But 
the main thing we must do on the path to it is change the 
people's attitude toward property. We have already proclaimed 
the right to ownership of the land and we have adopted a whole 
package of laws, which shows the irreversibility of our movement 
toward the market. We think that only with the creation of a 
class of owners will there appear a basis for political reforms 
and democratization. 
  We are moving toward and will definitely arrive at a normal 
democratic society. But only on our own path.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Yakovlev, doctor of juridical </F>
sciences, plenipotentiary of the president of the Russian 
Federation in the Federal Assembly, by Olga Kondratyeva, 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent; place and date not given: 
"Aleksandr Yakovlev: 'I Intend to Serve the Constitution, and 
Not Political Ambitions'"] 
  [Text] A new position was recently introduced in the 
administration of the Russian Federation president--the 
plenipotentiary of the president of the Russian Federation in 
the Federal Assembly. Doctor of Juridical Sciences Aleksandr 
Yakovlev, with whom our correspondent met, has been assigned to 
this position. 
  [Kondratyeva] Aleksandr Maksimovich, what do you see as the 
substance of your activity? 
  [Yakovlev] The functions of the plenipotentiary of the 
president in the Federal Assembly are based directly on those 
norms of the constitution that stipulate the rights and duties 
of the president with respect to parliament. The president has 
the right of legislative initiative. Moreover, my task is to 
present this initiative to the legislative organ and, if 
necessary, to clarify, to convince, and to take counterproposals 
into account. 
  My task is to see to it that the legislative and executive 
authority work in a coordinated way. They are separated not for 
rivalry, but for interaction. I am convinced: There are no such 
contradictions that cannot be settled via the parliamentary 
route within the framework of the constitution. 
  By the way, the function of feedback--from parliament to the 
president--is not just my responsibility, but my moral and 
political duty. I will be happy, if I am able to reconcile 
disputes before they develop. After all, disputes frequently are 
not the result of somebody's malicious will, but of 
informational inadequacy. Disagreements are also possible on a 
conceptual basis, but they are not terrible if they are opposed 
by an agreement to resort to the constitutional method of 
resolving a dispute, and with mutual respect by the sides. 
  I think of myself as a servant of the constitution, and I 
intend to serve it only, and not political ambitions. 
  [Kondratyeva] Aleksandr Maksimovich, does a similar position 
exist in the political practice of the West, in particular in 
the United States? For example, is there an official in the 
Clinton administration for organizing mutual relations with 
Congress? Or is this our national character molded by the 
confrontation we all remember between the president and the 
Supreme Soviet? 
  [Yakovlev] A significant part of the activity of the 
American 
President consists of consultations and searches for mutually 
acceptable decisions in contact both with senators and also with 
members of the House of Representatives. 
  [Kondratyeva] That is, you want to say that in the 
administration of the President of the United States a whole 
service is engaged in the "building of bridges" with Congress? 
  [Yakovlev] Exactly this kind of a service is being 
established now in B. Yeltsin's administration: a working 
apparatus of the plenipotentiary of the president of the Russian 
Federation in the Federal Assembly. I am right now engaged in 
the formation of this apparatus, which will be joined by highly 
qualified lawyers who have parliamentary work experience. 
  [Kondratyeva] If your service had been established a lot 
sooner, at the beginning of the epoch of the confrontation of 
the president and the Supreme Soviet--and we recall the 
dramatism of the mutual relations of the two branches of 
authority that heated up starting from December 1992--would it 
have been possible to prevent the tragic events of last autumn? 
  [Yakovlev] The separation of powers is not a whim, but a 
condition for the existence of a free government. But this idea 
should have been put into practice by people who are accustomed 
to the idea that the unity of authority is a predominant 
principle. Therefore, a situation arose not of separation, but 
of dualism of powers: Both centers tried to concentrate power in 
their own hands; therefore, rivalry between them proved to be 
inevitable. It is precisely in this that I see the tragedy of 
the past. 
  It remains to be hoped that now, when the principle of the 
separation of powers is logically embodied in the structure of 
authority, the condition has developed for the creation of a 
rule-of-law civilized state. But again only the condition! If 
just one of the branches of authority begins to be guided not by 
the constitution, but by political consideration, expect trouble. 
  At present, one frequently hears, they say, we did not elect 
the right ones to parliament. We elected those who were 
available! Indeed, we encountered phantom parties behind which 
no one stands. But this is the result of the crudity of our 
political history. The Labor Party of England was created over 
centuries. The Democratic and Republican Parties in the United 
States also have a couple of hundred years behind them. 
  Elections are the great political eliminators of ignorance. 
We have already lived through one political campaign, now 
elections to local organs of authority are going on, and within 
two years we will have a still more serious test--elections of 
both parliament and the president. This is the best school for 
the political maturation of the people and the formation of 
leaders and parties of a democratic persuasion. 
  The word "citizen" [grazhdanin] came from the word "city 
dweller" [gorozhanin], which means "a free person." Strictly 
speaking, until 1861, a majority of Russians were not citizens. 
And they again stopped being citizens after 1917. It is only in 
recent times that the process of reanimation of a civic society 
started. What does it mean to be a citizen and a free person? To 
possess political freedom? Not only. A beggar does not need 
political freedom--in his hands it is a dangerous weapon. What 
is also needed is economic freedom associated with the 
development of the institution of private property. Without 
economic prosperity and democracy, it is not worth a farthing. 
  [Kondratyeva] What percentage of the population should 
become 
citizens in order for society to be socially and economically 
stable? 
  [Yakovlev] At least 30 percent. Then this third will entice 
those who are wavering. You know, some schooners have a lead 
keel underneath, which gives a maneuvering schooner stability. 
That which history has called the "third estate" gives a firm 
basis to a civic society. 
  [Kondratyeva] In your opinion, how much time is needed for 
Russia to receive such a rigging? I think that an important 
increase in the third estate will begin within three to five 
years. This is my intuitive feeling of the style and pace of our 
development. A lot depends on our faith in the future and in the 
possibility of living as they do in the prosperous democratic 
states.

  [Text] Early in the morning you wake up 
  And you open the newspaper 
  And on the first page-- 
  Golden words! 
  It is Klim Voroshilov 
  And brother Budennyy 
  Who granted freedom-- 
  The people love them! 
  That is what they used to sing in the camps in the age of 
the 
great and terrible amnesty after Stalin's death. I do not know 
whether in Lefortovo, Sailors' Rest, or other not so distant 
places they will compose another song in honor of the amnesty of 
23 February 1994, but if they do a whole song will not be enough 
to contain the names of those who are loved by the people. 
  Eight factions and deputy groups of the State Duma found the 
strength within themselves to take an extraordinary step for the 
sake of social harmony--to declare, along with the criminal 
amnesty, political and economic amnesty as well, accompanying 
this act with the adoption of the Memorandum on Harmony. Let us 
list just their formal and informal leaders. They include Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin (Agrarian Party), Vladimir Medvedev (New 
Regional Policy), Alevtina Fedulova (Women of Russia), Sergey 
Shakhray (Party of Russian Unity and Accord), Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy (Liberal Democratic Party), Nikolay Travkin 
(Democratic Party), Gennadiy Zyuganov (Communist Party), Sergey 
Baburin and Yuriy Vlasov (Russian Way). Nor can one fail to 
mention along with them the chairmen of Duma committees on 
legislation and security--Vladimir Isakov and Viktor Ilyukhin, 
who did an immense amount of work to find a solution that was 
mutually acceptable to the majority of deputies, even if it was 
on the third go-around. 
  By adopting it the Duma actually put forth its own political 
anticrisis platform and was days ahead of Yeltsin, who delivered 
a watered-down and content-deficient message "On Strengthening 
the Russian State." Therefore it is no wonder that from the 
president's circle one could immediately hear irritated comments 
and appeals not to implement the Duma's decision which, 
according to the text of the Constitution, which was written in 
that same circle, is its exclusive prerogative. 
  The reason for the irritation is understandable. His circle 
never expected that with such a varied and contradictory 
composition parliament would manage to achieve such a complex 
and multistage compromise. Therefore it is worthwhile to 
consider in detail how this was done. 
  The quantitative results of the voting in which the final 
decision was adopted ("for"--252, "against"--67, 
"abstentions"--28) far from fully reveals the picture of the 
struggle and even creates the illusion that the supporters of 
the decision had an overwhelming majority. But that is far from 
true. In the first place, to adopt any decision requires a 
minimum of 223 votes, and therefore not only a direct vote 
"against" but also an "abstention" and failure to participate in 
the voting and absence from the meeting actually mean to vote 
against it. In the second place, there were two votes, and the 
first was not successful. 
  The fact is that it was decided to adopt four documents all 
at once as a single package: the Memorandum on Harmony, the 
decree on general criminal amnesty, the decree on political and 
economic amnesty, and the decree on abolition of the commission 
for investigating the events of 21 September-4 October. But 
first, at the suggestion of the factions of the Agrarian and 
Communist Parties, they voted on a "small package"--without the 
four decrees. The negative result ("for"--209, "against"--81, 
"abstentions"--16) immediately put the success of the "large 
package" in real jeopardy because for many it was exceedingly 
difficult to vote to abolish the commission, on whose creation 
immense effort had been expended. And not all were willing to 
accept this difficult compromise. 
  The results of the two roll-call votes with a breakdown 
according to factions are presented in the table. It takes into 
account not only those who voted but also all deputies who were 
physically present at the session, and for greater clarity, 
abstentions and failure to vote are equated to a vote "against." 
From this it is very clear what kind of dramatic struggle took 
place in the hall and in the soul of each deputy and the 
elements from which the final decision was formed. The overall 
total of columns I and II gives the number of votes "for" and 
the total of columns III and IV is equal to the number of votes 
"against" in the first vote. And for the second vote the number 
of votes "for" is equal to the sum of columns II and III, and 
the number of votes "against" is equal to the sum of columns I 
and IV. 
  Thus the block of 209 votes "for" in the first vote changed 
(in just a couple of minutes!) by the second vote not only 
quantitatively but also qualitatively. It lost 18 of its 
previous supporters but it acquired 61 new ones. If there had 
been half this number--everything would have been ruined. 
  After studying independently how similar processes took 
place 
within the factions, the reader will be able to judge the 
essence of their positions and the degree of unity and 
discipline, and also the efforts it takes the Duma to make 
literally every one of its decisions. 
  Spiteful critics call this horse trading, a business deal! 
We 
call it something else: compromise, without which, with the 
present alignment of forces, nothing can be done in the 
parliamentary arena. Did the opposition have to concede 
something important and valuable? It did. Was this easy to do? 
Absolutely not. But what was achieved was very 
important--political defendants and prisoners were freed from 
persecution: participants in the events of 19-21 August 1991, 
and 1 May and 21 September-4 October 1993. That is the first 
thing. The second thing is that, by adopting its Memorandum, 
suggesting the idea of forming a national accord government 
based on a parliamentary majority, the Duma firmly stated that 
it does not intend to remain in the back yard of political life, 
where it was assigned a place by the "creators" of the new 
Constitution. The country simply does not need a powerless 
parliament. 
  To find a source of confrontation in these obvious steps 
toward civil peace would take a truly deranged imagination.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by Aleksandr </F>
Prokhanov; place and date not given: "Zhirinovskiy: `I Will 
Drive Into the Kremlin!'"] 
  [Text] [Prokhanov] Vladimir Volfovich, you are a very 
eccentric politician. Your takeoff, which occurred several years 
ago, has been noticed and conceptualized seriously by patriotic 
circles. Some have sympathized with you, others have called for 
caution in relation to you. Following the party's victory at the 
December elections you have become a political star, and for 
this reason the "Zhirinovskiy in the patriotic movement" problem 
has become very pertinent, problem No. 1. I would very much like 
to understand a number of your statements and postulates and to 
listen to you not as a propagandist formulating a political 
cosmogony but as an experienced technologist because the 
political role you have chosen for yourself--No. 1 in the 
country, president--demands a knowledge of technology. And the 
task I have set myself is to listen to Zhirinovskiy primarily as 
a political technologist. 
  You employ, like I myself and my friends, such a category as 
the Russian idea. In concise terms, the Russian idea in its 
contemporary interpretation amounts approximately to four or 
five positions. The first: Russia has to be vast--I refer to the 
spatial factor. The second: Russia is a polyethnic empire, and 
Russians, as the dominating people, are nonetheless open to 
other nations, that is, this is not some mono-ethnic fascist 
state. The third: Russia must under any system be a country of 
justice, it is embedded in the Russian idea. And the fourth: 
Russia is a religious country, a country of mystical search and 
a cosmic perception of the world. 
  It is in these areas that I would like to talk with you. My 
first question, therefore, is this. You will agree that this 
escheated, cloven, diminished, and mongrel so-called Russian 
Federation is in no way Russia as such. Russia is an empire from 
Vladivostok, and you would say, to Belgrade even. What do you 
think, will this weakened, this castrated Russia once again 
assemble its territories? What political techniques do you see 
for the reconstitution of these super-expanses? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] When the USSR was falling apart, I was very 
distressed. I thought that this was a tragedy. Now I believe 
that this was objective reality. It had to happen. For the real 
victory of the Russian idea we had to have the collapse of the 
artificial state of the USSR, in which Russians were swallowed 
up by the general masses, as in a musical ensemble in which the 
Russian violin was no longer audible: there are many other 
instruments, and the violin might go unnoticed altogether. We 
had to break up in order to tear off from primordial Russia that 
which was alien which had attempted to make it nondominant. The 
Baltic, Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia tower up, for 
example, everyone suddenly pays attention to them, and Russia 
and its interests are forgotten, as it were. 
  We needed this explosion, an explosion without a war, in 
order that the skeleton of the Russian state might appear. This 
skeleton is associated with historical borders--everyone knows 
where the borders of the Russian Empire with living Russian 
people ran. The Dniester region, say--there is part of the 
skeleton, and there are Russian people. There is Estonia, there 
is Kazakhstan or Kushka, Ashkhabad. There are in our party's 
administrative machinery several boys from Ashkhabad, Russians. 
The mother remarried, the father went to Ukraine with someone 
else--and the Russian boy found himself homeless. The mother in 
Ashkhabad is abroad, the father in Ukraine is abroad. These are 
your new families. And they are everywhere, Russian people. It 
is they that show us the skeleton of the future Russian state, 
that is, this means the borders, at a minimum, of the USSR. At a 
minimum! 
  Now about techniques. I was speaking about this long since. 
You can check this out, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA some time in August 
1988, an article against Novodvorskiy and myself. Such people as 
Novodvorskiy and Zhirinovskiy, it said, are well known for their 
antisocialist views and so forth. And what has Zhirinovskiy gone 
so far as to say? Russian needs to be awaken by blood!... I said 
this at an Armenian demonstration, near the Armenian Cemetery at 
Vagankovo. I said that you Armenians are now the victims of 
Sumgait, you have become victims so that the correct processes 
in the Transcaucasus might begin. Had Sumgait not happened, 
everything would have continued to molder on this way. The 
oppression of Armenians in Nagornyy Karabakh and its absorption 
by Azerbaijan would have continued, just as they swallowed up 
Nakhichevan: It used to be 100 percent Armenians there, now they 
constitute 5 percent. Nagornyy Karabakh--the same thing.... 
  Unfortunately, in Russia also, for the Russian nation to be 
awaken, it could be awaken by blood. I said this at a time when 
October 1993 was not even close. Not because I am blood-thirsty. 
It is simply that the national consciousness and understanding 
of Russia and Rus have been so enfeebled that the words "Holy 
Rus" are perceived as a tale--once upon a time there was Holy 
Rus, some Russian folk heroes, the Russian Church.... 
  What the West European world is doing today we did in 
1921--the USSR: a commonwealth of countries and peoples, one 
language, and a single currency, remaining in principle 
different peoples, without borders. They are now doing this 
also, but in a somewhat different way. They simply cannot bring 
all this to a conclusion. They are afraid of depersonalization, 
they are afraid that in a commonwealth they will be "Europeans," 
but will not be, for example, Germans. There would no longer be 
marks but ECU's. The language would be half-English, 
half-German, half-French. They are afraid of becoming dissolved 
and of losing themselves, they are afraid that the influx of 
Turks, Arabs, Gypsies, Romanians, and others could bring about 
the degradation and disappearance of certain European nations. 
  We have been fortunate in this respect. It is this component 
of Russia--its immense space--that enables us once again today 
to become a great state. And the Serbs told me: We want to be 
together with the Russians, and a new Slav Orthodox state and 
new East European community from Vladivostok to Knin--the 
southernmost Serbian city on the Adriatic coast--would then 
emerge. 
  Here we are. There are 300-500 million of us in this space, 
and we have always lived there. We never came as aggressors, as 
barbarians, we did not destroy cultures--we uplifted them. The 
Kazakhs lived in tents, the family lived by grazing 20 sheep and 
was entirely self-sufficient--in food and woolen clothing. It 
lived without lighting, without books, without an alphabet, 
without indoor plumbing--without everything. People would sleep 
on the felt mat, they would cover themselves with the felt mat. 
It was sheep, man and sheep. All production was concentrated in 
this, no science, no culture, nothing. We raised up this people 
to cosmic heights! Russians, on the other hand, we are pulling 
down.... 
  [Prokhanov] And how will you once again build into Russia 
these backward outlying areas--via the economy, via their 
inferiority complex, their ruin, via their internal conflicts 
and strife, via Russian arbitration, via Russian technology, via 
the Russian hostages who live there in enormous colonies?... How? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] You yourself, Aleksandr Andreyevich, have 
answered this question, you yourself have said it all. This is 
how parties band together. You and I were not together, in one 
party, but we think identically. Via the economy and the space 
and the Russians living outside of the present Russian 
Federation precisely. After all, today, when Russians are 
leaving Ashkhabad, the ambulance service is ceasing to operate 
because the physicians were Russians. Russians are leaving 
Tajikistan, and the airplanes are no longer flying because the 
pilots were Russians. When the Russians have left altogether, 
everything will fall apart there, unfortunately. 
  Engineers, economists, production specialists, doctors, 
architects, teachers--all were Russian specialists, and the 
Bolsheviks artificially made them deputies. The local was the 
top man, but it was the deputy, the Russian, who did everything. 
The top man merely drank tea: the Turkmen, the Tajik, the Uzbek, 
the Kazakh. The Russian deputy has left, and now everything is 
caving in.... When we stop the subsidies and sales at low 
prices, their economy will collapse in an instant. It is caving 
in already. Tajikistan is already asking back in, as are Georgia 
and Armenia and Azerbaijan. Even into this weak Russia! And if 
within a few years--two-four--we have raised it up, they will 
come running to us! 
  But the military factor is obligatory here because they will 
clash with one another. Two worlds will collide in Central Asia: 
the Farsi-speaking, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and the 
Turkic-speaking, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan. Muslims--two schools 
here: Sunni and Shi'a--will clash. In the Transcaucasus 
Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis have already 
clashed, and Christian Georgians and semi-Christian, semi-Muslim 
Abkhaz have clashed in Georgia. They have all collided already, 
they are all covered in blood. 
  Were we to halt supplies and trade with them altogether--the 
end. No more of these states! We may be quite at ease here: In 
two or three years they would be imploring Russians to return. 
And they would come back in on the terms of territories, 
provinces, oblasts. 
  One Russian family returned from Tbilisi a year ago. They 
said that slogans had appeared on the walls of houses: 
"Russians, don't go, who will bury the Georgians!" This is the 
quintessence. When the Georgians have understood that, yes, you 
can spit in the Russian's face, you can rape a Russian woman, 
you can drive out a Russian family, you can attack Russian 
soldiers, but the sole outcome of all this: Who will bury the 
Georgians? 
  [Prokhanov] So reintegration will take place via the tragedy 
of these people? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Via their ruin! The death of millions of 
Tajiks, Georgians, Uzbeks. 
  [Prokhanov] Is this, possibly, the inevitable price these 
peoples will have to pay to once again be taken into the fold of 
the empire? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, precisely. 
  [Prokhanov] Very well, now the second question. We have said 
that Russia, the Russian Empire, is a country open to all 
nations. Russian statehood was never ethnic. We built an empire 
such that the Russian factor neighbored the Tatar factor, and 
the Orthodox factor, the Muslim factor. This empire, rolling out 
the carpet, as it were, encompassed a multitude of faiths and 
peoples without suppressing them. And now, as I recall from your 
statements and books, the statehood we are beginning to build 
will contain traditional features--from the states of Kiev and 
Muscovy and from tsarism and the empire, that is, formations 
open to other nations. 
  The Russian dominant essentially presupposes the equality of 
all nations before the law, before the sovereign, before the 
territory, before history. This is how it is. But there is this 
paradox. Here is this dreadful destruction that has befallen us, 
and the calamities that are to come, that still lie ahead, will 
be the most dreadful, perhaps. They will require the maximum 
efforts, colossal sacrifices, essentially, for the revival of 
our motherland. And these efforts and sacrifices may be made by 
that same Russian people. 
  Speaking of the equality of the nations before history, 
therefore, we understand full well that once again incumbent 
upon Russians will be the immense mission of the creation of 
this new statehood. And this is not some maniacal approach, what 
is more, but historical necessity, expediency. We cannot live 
without an outlet to the Pacific, we cannot live without 
geopolitical passes through the Dzuunhaar Gate, we cannot live 
without outlets to the Baltic and the Gulf stream. 
  Do you realize that in constantly repeating "Russians 
first," 
"Russians at the center of policy," "the Russian state for the 
Russians" we are thereby saying: Russians, prepare for 
sacrifices, Russians, prepare for great building, Russians, 
prepare for the utterance of yet one more great Russian song? 
  The 20th century was essentially the Russian 
century--Russians in Africa, Russians in Latin America, Russians 
at the poles, in space, on the ocean floor.... And will the 21st 
century be a Russian century also? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It is here that a new factor, which was not 
used by the communists at the final stage, when it was clear 
that there would be no communist world, emerges. The democrats 
have not made use of it either. We need to make sure that we 
Russians are paid for the fact that we have saved the world from 
a general catastrophe--a possible World War III--environmental 
also. We must show the world that we will not again sacrifice 
the Russian people just like that. We must force them to first 
pay us for the sacrifices we have borne, for the fact that they 
contributed to the destruction of the Russian state. Only on the 
basis of this will we move ahead. 
  And for this we must make use of the remnants of the Russian 
Empire and the communist USSR--the powerful military industry, 
the powerful weapons, and the heroic spirit of the Russian 
people, but without exposing Russian boys' heads to the bullet 
or putting our daughters in the beds of all the bordellos of 
Europe. Via, precisely, the powerful factor of a revival of 
Russian military industry, when the world would be bound to be 
in a state of the constant possibility of a terrible war. We 
would not start it, but the West must understand that to prevent 
this happening it needs to pay today, to repay its debts to the 
Russians. 
  I said to the Germans: Why are you paying the Jews, 6 
million 
of them perished? You are paying Israel tremendous amounts 
annually. They said: Israel means Zionism on a world scale, we 
have to do this because we are afraid of the further Zionization 
of Germany, but the Russians, they are no threat to us.... 
  This was a mistake--the withdrawal of our army from Germany. 
A half million-strong Russian army would be there now also had 
it not been withdrawn by Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, who 
pocketed enormous sums--for the pullout of our army and the 
start of the collapse of East Europe and the collapse of the 
USSR. We should be telling the Germans today: First pay us for 
the 26 million dead, then at the start of the century, by the 
year 2010, possibly, you will reunite with East Germany. But we 
gave up everything--and for pennies. Kohl offered to pay 
Gorbachev 10 times more, made the offer himself. Gorbachev said: 
That's okay. What is this if not treachery? 
  While we still have possibilities, therefore, and we do, we 
need to start to act. And I absolutely do not believe that 
Russia might perish, that we will not manage. We will get out, 
we are already getting out of the situation. For in terms of 
spirituality the Orthodox world is first today. The West has 
become completely demoralized. It has nothing left but 
McDonalds, pornography, and this brutal rationalism: buy-sell, 
how much, if you have money, you are somebody, if not, you are 
nobody. 
  The East has its own specific features. It is far removed 
from us. We cannot be Buddhists. Shintoism, Krishnaism, 
Hinduism--all this is far removed from us, a different 
civilization. Nor does the Muslim faith suit us because for them 
we are the infidel. It is an exploit for them to kill us, the 
infidel, or to compel us to become Muslims by force. Ours, that 
of Orthodox, Slavs, remains the sole spiritual world, therefore. 
  And we live compactly. Were we to live in Australia, South 
Africa, Latin America, we would all perish, there would be no 
Russians. But Slavs and Orthodox, we truly live by one territory. 
  Even today the Poles, knowing that I am prepared to treat 
with the Germans for the return of Prussia, are agreeing to 
negotiate: They understand that they would lose part of Poland, 
that it is better to go over to the Russians and retain Gdansk, 
not Danzig, retain Szczecin, not Stettin, Wroclaw, not Breslau. 
It is this that we have to compel them to do. And I have done 
so! I, no one as yet, have forced them to do it today--prior to 
the 12 December elections. They have already taken fright.... 
  The Finnish Army has been arming for two years now because 
they have been saying there: If Zhirinovskiy comes to power, the 
return of Finland as part of the empire is possible. I do not 
want this, but they are afraid. Today they, the Finns, have a 
poorer life than we do. When I was there, in 1990, they had 
50,000 unemployed, today, 350,000. And the Finnish Army is 
consuming several times more. We have forced them by theory 
alone, not practice, only theory and a different foreign policy 
concept, to change, we have made them poorer and weaker! 
  The Turkish Army has today halted demobilization. I do not 
command the army yet, I am not yet president, but merely having 
read my book, they have delayed the mobilization [as published] 
of 1 million Turks--the strongest army on this flank of NATO, 
trained for an assault on the Caucasus and Central Asia. I am 
nobody as yet, but with this spirit and this new ideology we 
have forced neighboring countries to change their policy--both 
foreign and domestic. 
  The whole of Serbia carried posters, I am forced to say 
this, 
and they affirm: "Peter the Great II has come!" They, the Serbs, 
compare me with Peter I. I have never compared myself with him, 
of course, I am not a fanatic, and I have no plans to be a 
chief, to be a great figure. But they, the Serbs, say: 
"Vladimir, be the leader of the Slav peoples!" They gave me a 
document attesting the creation of a cultural-political center 
of Slav states, and they are imploring me to be its president. 
  So it is that we are winning here even today. But if 
tomorrow 
I am in the Kremlin, I assure you, just three months, and all 
the independent states will have collapsed. Because Kravchuk, 
for example, is saying: Let's do it today, while Yeltsin is in 
Moscow, tomorrow it will be Zhirinovskiy--that will be it, there 
will be no sovereign Ukraine. The Tatars in Kazan are saying the 
same thing. They will understand the mere fact of my accession 
to power thus: It's all over, there is only the Russian state. 
  Nazarbayev switched television off when I appeared during 
the 
elections. Fifteen million inhabitants of Kazakhstan were 
deprived of the opportunity to watch Ostankino television merely 
because I was speaking! I was still only a candidate for deputy 
of the State Duma, and they were already afraid, trembling 
nervously, and already packing their bags! 
  This is a psychological factor. They know there was a great 
Russia, the Russian Empire, and that a party has appeared that 
is saying plainly: "We will restore the borders of the Russian 
state, but peacefully." Hearing a new, tough Russian language, 
with a different vocabulary, they are already afraid. 
  Several persons in Turkmenia, fanatics, have already 
sentenced me to death. A mullah in Ufa has been collecting money 
to hire an assassin and have me killed. Information has also 
been received from Zionist circles in Europe. They met and said: 
We have made an accurate computation--the future president in 
Russia will be Zhirinovskiy. No one will beat him again, no one. 
There is just one thing for it--his physical removal. Only 
this.... 
  Others are attempting bribes. Some $100 million are being 
offered for me to quit politics. Talk about a factor! I am still 
nobody, I am the leader of a faction, which has only 64 deputies 
out of 450, not even half the deputies, not even one-third, are 
mine, and they are already so afraid that they are prepared to 
kill me or pay me off. 
  But they forget that killing would mean causing a terrible 
wave of anti-Semitism throughout Europe. The Jews would be wiped 
out completely, they would be burned everywhere--in Germany, in 
Serbia, in Russia.... Buying me is impossible--I am not for 
sale. Once again, the greatness of the Russian spirit. Were I a 
Lutheran, were I, say, a Protestant, a Catholic, they would buy 
me. A hundred million--you could live your whole life on the 
interest, your whole family, at the best resorts of Europe. I 
shall not sell myself, however, even if the entire budget of all 
the Zionists is offered. I do not want their money. 
  I want the homeland, my fatherland. I will stand in a torn 
coat, stand on Russian soil, so that the Russian flag fly and 
this be our country! It is this that they cannot understand, 
that they cannot get.... 
  [Prokhanov] Truly, giant potential is, evidently, bottled up 
in our people. They are prevented from showing what they are 
capable of, they are continually being beaten down, driven into 
the dust, into the earth. So that were this potential to be 
revealed, an absolutely new situation, global situation, would 
arise, as would that resource with which it would once again be 
possible to marshal an empire and throw funds into a 
breakthrough into the technotronic era, into a new civilization. 
  And, as far as I understand it, this entire potential, being 
realized, would, truly, force the world to pay its arrears for 
World War II and for this immense cordon we have erected along 
the Urals and for that essentially mystical energy which Russia 
is continually reproducing in the world. Have I understood you 
correctly? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes. It was for this great breakthrough that 
the potential of the great nation, which has been struggling 
continuously for a thousand years, was created. We will break 
through for the added reason that the Mongols were here for 300 
years, because Charles XII was here, there was Napoleon, there 
were the German fascists, and 30 wars with Turkey. This is 
embedded in the blood of each Slavic, Russian boy raised on this 
history. It is all this that will produce an explosion. 
  When I was in Serbia, I saw combatants of the Serbian Unity 
Party--these Orthodox boys in black uniforms. This is it, the 
new Orthodox army! These are men condemned to die, they will 
sweep aside all in their path. And these are Serbs, a small 
people, a small country! And were Russian boys to rise up this 
way, with our great science, with our tremendous military 
potential, with our missiles, with our Buran, with our tanks and 
vertical-takeoff aircraft, with our new weapons! The world would 
tremble. 
  After all, I alone have caused so much clamor, take a look 
at 
the press for December 1993--they all went mad! I merely amassed 
13 percent in the Duma, and the world is already going mad! They 
have all already taken fright. They have come to a halt because 
they have seen the new Russia. Even if this might well not be in 
my person. But they have sensed the beginning of the collapse: 
of both socialist Russia and pseudo-democratic Russia, and that 
the new Russian state is emerging. This is putting them in all 
in a fearful quiver for it is smashing all their plans. 
  [Prokhanov] All that you say impresses the Russian 
imperialist and the Russian nationalist and the Russian patriot. 
This is, most likely, correct. Now tell us about the third 
postulate of the Russian idea. This is the proposition 
concerning justice. Truly, "God is not in strength but in 
truth," God is not in a vertical-takeoff aircraft but, in some 
relationship of the pilot and copilot, probably, or the sailor, 
who puts this craft into the air and brings it in, lacerated, 
onto the deck of the carrier. 
  What do you think, what path will the building of Russian 
statehood take? What will it be--tsarism, a monarchy, a 
dictatorship, a country of presidents, a country with a chief, a 
parliamentary republic, an assembly, a town meeting? After all, 
Russia has tremendous experience of state building and a 
multitude of options. One collapses, another jumps to the 
surface. And embedded in all this is the idea of fraternity, the 
idea of mutual assistance--give the last crumb to your loved 
one, give the last shirt off your back. 
  What do you think, will the principle of justice be embedded 
in the institution of state power? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I am a supporter of the modern form of 
government here. I am not a monarchist. I understand that 
monarchy and Orthodoxy were the basis of the Russian Empire. 
But, nonetheless, I believe that to call the head of state the 
Russian tsar, in a polyethnic state, would today be something of 
an impediment for us. 
  Were there a purely Russian state, there would be the town 
meeting, the tsar--everything Russian. But considering the 
polyethnic composition of the population, it is better to take 
the international form in the shape of a presidential republic. 
He could be called in Russian chairman of the republic, as with 
the Chinese. This would be easier for the world, the word 
"empire" is intimidating. It is a good word, Russia needs it, 
but it intimidates part of the populace, just like the idea of 
communism--also not bad in itself but it intimidated people by 
the methods of its implementation. 
  We should keep the word "republic," we should keep the form 
of presidential republic where the head of state has the greater 
powers for parliament with us will willy-nilly become 
polyethnic, and we will have, like it or not, to decide 
questions of the territories there. The nationality issue will 
arise. And we provisionally need a strong executive so that we 
not deliberate but execute, and swiftly, within the framework of 
the law, because certain questions simply cannot be raised 
within the framework of parliament. 
  The treaty with Georgia today, for example. We don't need 
it. 
The president is wrong, he is making a mistake in concluding a 
treaty with Georgia. But this is not what I'm talking about. Had 
this issue been discussed in parliament, this would have evoked, 
in Georgia, for example, many reasons for not approving it. 
  Let us look at this event from the other side. Let us 
imagine 
that the president was someone else, that he was myself. 
Shevardnadze calls Yeltsin: Let's conclude a treaty, look at 
what's happening, help me, save me, we were, after all, in the 
Politburo together. He would not talk to me this way because he 
and I were not in the Politburo together. This is what the idea 
of a new president consists of! So that Shevardnadze, Aliyev, 
Karimov, Nazarbayev cannot bring it up: We are party comrades, 
we were in the same Central Committee, help me, as a party 
comrade. The "party comrades" business is over! 
  With me there would be one thing: We are the Russian state. 
We will accept you, certainly, as Tiflis Province. Certainly, we 
could agree provisionally to you, Eduard Amvrosiyevich, being 
governor of this province. But it would be even better were 
there a Russian there.... But the way in which this is happening 
today--the attempt to reconstitute the amorphous CIS in the form 
of the former model of the USSR--we don't need this. 
  The state, therefore, should be only Russian, only a 
republic. God forbid that we have some autonomies, republics 
within Russia. Only provinces--40 large provinces. We are now 
160 million--4 million in each. If we get back the former 
territories, we will be 300 million, that is, this would be 
approximately 80 provinces with a purely administrative division. 
  Forget about national state formations within our state! 
This 
would then be a modern republic with a strong presidential 
regime, a strong parliament, and a strong government. And, in 
addition, another judicial system--we need to return to the jury 
system, where the best people of the city--about 20 
persons--decide, and a highly skilled legal expert formalizes 
this decision. 
  It is Russian statehood that is needed, and it is in this 
that this goodness of ours and our attitude toward the peoples, 
which we did not destroy, consists. We made mistakes here and 
there. Destroying was out of the question, but so was elevating 
them artificially, belittling Russians here. Only that which was 
surplus should have been given. But under no circumstances the 
very last thing. It was this goodness of ours that was excessive. 
  And here is the drawback of the Mongol invasion. When the 
Russian was down to his last shirt and went against the 
conqueror with his spear, he could, indeed, share his last 
crust. But seven centuries have gone by. We are not the same. We 
cannot today undertake the privatization of forests for the 
Yakuts so that they might have hunting grounds on private 
property. Three Yakuts would have 10,000 square kilometers of 
forest, and 9 million-strong Krasnodar Kray, where Russians 
live, would have nothing. Privatization would not come off on a 
national basis either. We are Russia--one state. 
  [Prokhanov] You mentioned that Russia and the Slav world 
have 
a mysterious inexhaustible spiritual energy. As though we derive 
this energy from our valleys, expanses, and rivers, from 
history, from space, and this is, evidently, as giant a 
resource, as much a source of wealth, more even, perhaps, as 
uranium, as production itself, as, iron, steel, and the 
professional skills of the nation. It is very often asked what 
kind of system for Russia you see in the future: communist, 
bourgeois, mixed, primitive-communal.... 
  In actual fact, the future will most likely be an absolutely 
new civilization, which will not lend itself to such classical 
descriptions. And this potential of spirituality--awareness of 
God, sensory perception, and use of the colossal elements of 
history and the nation--will essentially become the driving 
factor of society, the body politic. New ethics, new 
environmental consciousness. When the perception of the life of 
grass, a rock, or a river, like the life of your own family.... 
  So if we are speaking of this component of religious, 
mystical, and scientific cognition, which will become the 
principal resource for the future state and which Russia 
possesses like no other nation--how will you avail yourself of 
this resource in the building of the future body politic? 
Primarily, of course, the economy, plants, the organization of 
the plants--and how will this be? Will the country be ruled by 
an oligarchy or, on the other hand, an equals sign?... How do 
you conceptualize this new civilization in your program of 
future restoration? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The equalizing principle is just is some 
places. A person is born and wants to have good clothes, a good 
house, good food. But economics requires that gifted people get 
more, for all that. Not because he needs black caviar, but it is 
simply that he has to see this appreciation of his labor in 
order to work harder and do more for others. Remuneration not on 
a party basis, it is not the communist who should receive more, 
not the mafioso, not the partocrat but the gifted individual, in 
any sphere: the gifted cabdriver, the gifted janitor, the gifted 
manager, the gifted scientist. We must pay talent in any sphere. 
This must be a rule of the evaluation of labor.... 
  I go abroad. Everyone knows and talks about us: 
Dostoyevskiy, 
Pushkin, Tchaikovsky. Throughout the world, the names of great 
Russians are known everywhere. Everyone knows Lenin also, 
Stalin--although with the blood and violence there--they know 
him, then space--Gagarin.... Russia has influenced the world 
consciousness to such an extent that any country will name 
someone Russian for you. 
  About Poles--nothing of the sort. I know Oginski's 
polonaise, 
I like it, the rest are not known. Or Bulgaria--some people 
simply do not know that there is such a country. 
  We are already putting pressure on the whole world 
psychologically, for we have in some respects become engraved on 
the consciousness of all of mankind. But for this new Russian 
state we must have an additional source of financing in order to 
more quickly raise up research and our education. We need to 
clear out all the inter-nation higher educational institutions. 
No University of Friendship of the Peoples--a Russian national 
university! And we must teach our children--Russians, Slavs. 
  Why are we teaching tribes which are returning to Africa and 
destroying one another? They are, after all, still cannibals, 
and we are teaching them! Had we ourselves assimilated the 
entire potential which the communists threw virtually free of 
charge into assistance to the world--Cuba, Nicaragua, Laos, 
Vietnam, Africa--we would be a very rich state. We need to stop 
helping others. We need to stop temporarily being kind. 
  Let us be kind to ourselves and think about ourselves a 
little. Let us be kinder among ourselves--we are, after all, 
Slavs, Russians, Orthodox. Let us get by without helping those 
who are living better than us. If we stop feeding people who 
today have a hostile attitude toward us, we will win 
automatically! 
  Nationalism has today been imposed artificially. Were we to 
halt supplies of Russian timber to Central Asia, all their 
construction projects would come to a halt. They would be left 
roofless, without homes. They should know: We would not perish 
without Uzbek cotton, Egyptian cotton is of better quality, and 
the Egyptians still owe us for the Aswan Dam. We would obtain 
cotton from Iraq, Iraq owes us too. But Uzbeks without Russian 
timber--that would be it, the end. The end for all of Central 
Asia--Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzia and Tajikistan. The Transcaucasus 
particularly--they have all been living on subsidies. 
  Within the next 10 years the new Russian state will be a 
leading light. Delegations of dying nations, worn out and bled 
white by a lengthy war, epidemic disease, and gangster raids, 
will be applying to join us--standing in line to get into the 
Kremlin, to see another president. They will beseech the 
president of Russia to incorporate them as a territorial unit 
within Russia. 
  We can do all this only thanks to the existing Russian 
industry, science, and culture. We need only a different form of 
government. To free ourselves from the vestiges of the communist 
past and this entire fraudulent democracy and to return to the 
best that had been accumulated in the Russian Empire, to some of 
the positive aspects in the communist USSR, to some positive 
endeavors at this time. We have some pluralism, for all that. 
  Despite all these bloody events, Russia is still without 
civil war. There is somewhat of this in the North Caucasus and 
in the Transcaucasus, but it is not taking place on the 
territory of Russia. We have been able to negotiate this tight 
spot. 
  Even today more than half the Russian Parliament practically 
is composed of the new, patriotic Russia. Five of the eight 
traitor-ministers have already left the government, just three 
remain. I will name them: Kozyrev, Chubays, Shokhin. Just three 
out of 23! And there are a further 56 committees, that is, out 
of the almost 80 members of the government, just three 
traitor-ministers. This is negligible! And the most repulsive 
faction of deputies consists of just 76 persons. Out of 450! 
Were they to unite, there would be 150 of them, but no more. And 
300 are different deputies. We have already won! 
  And the Russian Army is already restoring its might, our new 
MiG's are the fastest fighters, and no one has surpassed our 
Buran. In half an hour it can deliver a 60-tonne payload to any 
part of the planet. The Americans do not have anything like 
this. We have the necessary power today even. We need only a 
conclusive change of political leadership. 
  We will restore what we had and will develop further. Our 
scientists will return, our daughters will return, our boys will 
return from all the "flash points," families will be restored, 
and our economic potential will begin to work. 
  The Serbs are saying: We will clothe you and feed you, give 
us your raw material. Our chemical plants are at a standstill, 
you used to supply us with phosphates, let us have them today. 
India is saying: Let us have 100 submarines, and we will clothe 
you and feed you. Saddam Husayn said to me: I don't understand 
you, I owe you $10 billion--take it. Why don't you take it? 
  Were we to revise our foreign and domestic policy a little 
and take what we are being given, being implored to take, this 
in itself would have an enormous effect. But we need to quit the 
blockade of Iraq and the blockade of Yugoslavia and to restore 
normal relations with India, China, Japan. And we would resolve 
all our problems! Two or three years, and Russia would be 
unrecognizable. But for this one last step is needed--elections 
to the Russian Parliament once more, elections for the president 
of Russia once more. That's all! 
  [Prokhanov] I am most grateful to you for the interview. I 
have deliberately not commented on what you have said, merely 
asked you questions. And you have stated your ideas frankly and 
with absolute candor. I believe that what you have to say will 
be of interest to the readers of my newspaper and to patriotic 
intellectuals, who are concentrated around the newspaper, in 
general. I repeat: I have no desire to comment on it, to dress 
it up. Here is Zhirinovskiy extempore, in this interview.... 
  But the final, very brief, question. When do you plan the 
breakthrough into the Kremlin? What difficulties do you expect 
on this path and when do you intend to concentrate your entire 
willpower and your entire party machinery and potential for this 
surge? A push not to the South but to the Cathedral of the 
Assumption.... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We will officially begin our campaign on 2 
April--the party's fifth congress. We will begin a furious 
campaign for elections both for a new parliament and for the 
president of Russia. Some fall of 1994 option is entirely 
possible, I believe.... 
  [Prokhanov] Your intuition tells you this, as a political 
improvisation? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, yes, this is possible. The fall could 
once again bring surprises. When we put on one more spurt and 
the Kremlin is finally purged of anti-Russian forces.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "There Is a Little Tatar in Every </F>
Russian"] 
  [Text] Fedor Mikhaylovich Burlatskiy, candidate for deputy 
in the State Duma for Moskovskiy District No. 24, opened his 
press conference with this witty statement on the eve of a 
series of meetings with voters. Responding to journalists' 
friendly question why he is being nominated from the Republic of 
Tatarstan when he is not a resident of Tatarstan, the candidate 
said the sovereign republic's concerns are close to him, for as 
a member of the USSR Supreme Soviet he studied the problems of 
state organization, took part in preparing the federative 
agreement, and spoke out in support of granting autonomous 
Tatarstan the status of a union republic at that time. 
  Burlatskiy told the journalists that, as a deputy in the 
State Duma, he could be useful to Tatarstan in several areas. 
First of all, he has good contacts in the current parliament and 
the parties of democratic persuasion. Secondly, by having high 
international prestige, being in favor with many presidents, and 
by being a professor at three universities (Oxford, Harvard, and 
Heidelberg), he could help to strengthen Tatarstan further in 
the international arena. 
  Noted commentator Burlatskiy really is tremendously popular. 
He is familiar to many people from television and his articles 
in LITERATURKA, where he has been a political columnist and the 
editor in chief. Fedor Mikhaylovich has written political 
biographies of Khrushchev, Dobrolyubov, Mao, Kennedy, Franco, 
and Machiavelli... 
  He has been persecuted repeatedly by the powers that be. in 
1967 he was dismissed from PRAVDA for articles aginast the cult 
of personality and censorship. Even before that, in 1964, he 
resigned from a prestigious position as head of a group of 
consultants in the International Department of the CPSU Central 
Committee to show his disagreement with policy based on a 
revival of Stalinism. 
  Acquainting the journalists with his work as a former 
people's deputy of the USSR, Burlatskiy said he was involved in 
drafting laws on freedom of the press, religion, and movement. 
As chairman of the public Commission on Human Rights and the 
International Human Rights Movement (Carter's wife is cochairman 
of the latter), he brought about the release of over 400 persons 
who were imprisoned for so-called religious crimes. The 
commission has provided assistance in resolving political, 
housing, and other problems for 300,000 persons. 
  At present, Fedor Burlatskiy is working at the State and Law 
Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He has three 
children, and his wife is a journalist at NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. 
Burlatskiy's favorite hero is Don Quixote.

<F P=106> [Article by Armen Khanbabyan: "AES Will Resume </F>
Operations--But an Alternative Is Still Being Sought"] 
  [Text] A few days ago the Armenian state statistical 
administration published the data on the results of national 
industry operations for 1993. And some amazing things came to 
light. Despite the cutbacks in the volume of power engineering 
that brought its output to one-third of the 1992 level, 
industrial decline has been halted, and in some sectors--for 
instance, radioelectronics--there was even a perceptible upturn. 
VPK [Military-Industrial Complex] enterprises undergoing 
conversion did especially well; overall, 1 percent more of 
output was produced in 1993 than in 1992. The trend toward 
stabilization and growth continued in the current January as 
well. 
  The government maintains that this success is the result of 
a 
correct economic policy, the beginning of structural 
restructuring, and the change of the import-export ratio in 
favor of the latter. And most importantly, in the opinion of the 
Council of Ministers, this is the result of calculated and 
judicious use of scarce fuel and power resources. Everybody in 
Armenia, however, also knows quite well that in most cases 
enterprises are able to operate because they have a priority 
with respect to power supply at the expense of cutting back the 
consumption for social and household needs. For instance, this 
winter electric power for household needs was available for no 
more than three hours a day, and lately even that has been cut 
down to one hour. 
  This is why the government's intention to resume operations 
at the Armenian AES [nuclear electric power station], which was 
shut down immediately after the 1988 earthquake, today meet with 
practically no protestations. True, the AES has a lot of 
opposition outside the country. Both Tbilisi and Ankara are less 
than happy about the idea of its resurrection. The objections 
are mostly ecology-related. In Washington and other Western 
capitals there is less concern about the environmental health in 
the region; they, on the other hand, do not hide concerns that 
resumption of AES operations, which will produce spent nuclear 
fuel, may allow Armenia to start working on creating its own 
weapons of mass destruction. Moscow also has always entertained 
some suspicions of this kind. This may be the reason why all of 
Yerevan's pleas for credits for the station's restoration went 
unheeded. 
  The issue was suddenly resolved in an unexpected way. While 
on an official visit to London last week, President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan announced that Russia and Armenia will soon sign 
an agreement on creating a joint Armenian-Russian enterprise on 
the base of the AES. Thus, it was made clear to the West that it 
should not fear potential "nuclear ambitions" on the part of 
Yerevan: the station's operation will be under the control of 
one of the great powers which, of course, will never allow the 
AES to be used for military purposes. This already makes 
possible the prospect of receiving targeted credits from the 
West for development of the fuels and power sector. Meanwhile, 
Russia will undertake the main burden of financing AES 
restoration work. This should make it possible to restart one of 
the station's generators as early as the end of this year and to 
produce an additional 400 megawatts of electric power. One half, 
of course, will belong to the Russian side, and this factor will 
reinforce even more Yerevan's traditional economic and political 
dependence on Moscow, which literally will gain the ability to 
turn on and off the light in the Armenian population's 
apartments. In addition, transfer of electricity from Armenia to 
Russia is not economically effective because of the great 
distances. Therefore a piquant situation may arise whereby 
Russia will be selling electric power produced in Armenia to 
neighboring countries, with which Armenia at this point has 
strained relations, to put it mildly--to Turkey or even 
Azerbaijan. 
  The upcoming restart of the station is in every respect a 
forced step. The AES is situated in a troublesome area and may 
at any moment become the subject of a military attack. 
Therefore, Armenia is working on a parallel track searching for 
alternative solutions in finding reliable sources of energy for 
the country. In April, prospecting drilling probably will 
finally begin in Ararat Valley, where there are assumed oil and 
gas deposits. A program of building a score of medium- and 
small-capacity hydroelectric stations is in the development 
stage. In the production sphere the priority is given to 
energy-saving technologies. Certain hopes are also pinned on the 
plans for building a new major gas pipeline between Iran and 
West Europe. 
  In any event, implementation of even a part of these plans 
and projects will require considerable resources which Armenia 
today does not have. The restart of the AES will allow, however, 
achievement of a qualitative improvement in national industry 
operations and will seriously expand the republic's export 
potential. Another thing is clear as well: the soonest possible 
restoration of the AES, with all attendant costs, is necessary 
in order to create future conditions that will allow it to shut 
down again as soon as possible--this time, hopefully, for good.

<F P=106> [Appeal from Azerbaijan People's Front: "APF Calls On </F>
Government To Refrain From Strengthening The Fragmentation 
Within The Nation "] 
  [Text] The Azerbaijan People's Front [APF] has issued a 
statement in connection with the strengthening of the campaign 
by ruling circles against the APF and other opposition forces. 
The text of the statement is below: 
  "Recently, attacks against the APF and opposition forces in 
state information organs and statements of representatives of 
the ruling circle have become even stronger. The accusation is 
being spread that the political opposition is disturbed by 
successes gained by Azerbaijan's army on the front and about 
barriers standing before the successful course of military 
operations. [passage illegible] 
  "Even during the empire the APF, which was the first 
organization to rise to the struggle for Azerbaijan's 
independence and its territorial integrity, and which gave 
thousands from its ranks as martyrs in the struggle for 
Karabakh, emphatically rejects these accusations. At a time when 
a great portion of our soil is still under enemy control these 
accusations are the manifestation of a devious and malicious 
policy to create dissension in the ranks of the opposition 
within the nation and efforts to deal a new blow to our national 
unity under a situation when our territorial integrity is being 
violated. 
  "There have been times of great success and times of crisis 
in the history of the APF. But always and at all times 
patriotism, the Fatherland and the interests of the people have 
been and are our most important principles. The relationship of 
the APF to the present foreign and domestic policies advanced by 
the ruling circles is well known. At the same time, from the 
time of the further strengthening of attacks by the 
occupier-Armenians and the broadening of military operations on 
the front as a consequence of this, the APF has supported all 
measures for the sake of maintaining stability within the 
country. [passage illegible]...Despite the cessation of the 
publication of some channels of information, no sharp articles 
have been permitted. 
  [Passage illegible]..."although it remains questionable as 
to 
what these great military successes consist of, the organization 
is using all its possibilities and influence to verify these 
victories, and has directed the efforts of its members in this 
way. 
  "But at the same time, we also see efforts to blame every 
possible failure and all sins on the opposition, primarily the 
APF, and to direct public opinion along this line. At this 
responsible moment, the Azerbaijan People's Front appeals to the 
ruling circles of the republic to refrain from the dangerous 
path of strengthening the fragmentation within the nation during 
the fourth anniversary of 20 January which was a serious tragedy 
for our people and to call on the population not to listen to 
provocations."

  [Text] In the central offices of the Azerbaijan People's 
Front [APF] a meeting was held between leaders of the 
information operations of the APF, the Musavat, the Milli 
Istiglal [National Independence] and the "Yurddash" [Compatriot] 
parties. At the meeting, discussions on defining the principles 
of exchange of information and cooperation were discussed. It 
was noted that there was a great need for the constant exchange 
of accurate information due to the frequent distortion of 
information on resolutions passed and work done at the regular 
meetings of these organizations. Agreement was attained on this 
and measures for quickly completing the technical preparatory 
work have been defined. 
  The situation created in connection with the stoppage of 
publication of the press organs of a number of parties and 
independent newspapers was also discussed at the meeting. An 
appeal was dispatched to the National Assembly and international 
organizations. 
  At the meeting the question was also raised about creating 
the opportunity for the newspapers that have stopped printing to 
speak out in the party organs which continue to publish.

Opposition Newspapers"] 
  [Text] At the 13 January meeting of press and information 
service leaders of a number of party and public political 
organizations active in the republic, an appeal was sent to the 
National Assembly and the Permanent Representative of Azerbaijan 
at the UN. In is stated in the appeal: "After a decree was 
issued on 6 December 1993 on the application of military 
censorship in connection with the wartime conditions, political 
censorship was also reinforced. Recently the printing of 
newspapers was stopped under the pretext that they were 
obligated to do so. Printing permits were not issued to some 
newspapers to meet this obligation. We believe you will aid us 
in eliminating artificial obstacles which have been thrown in 
the way of the publication of opposition newspapers."

<F P=106> [Article by Babek Bekir: "Emigration From [Iranian] </F>
Azerbaijan To Azerbaijan; the Dust of This Caravan Still Has Not 
Settled"] 
  [Text] Emigration from [Iranian] Azerbaijan basically took 
place in the time period following the fall of the Azerbaijan 
Democratic Republic [ADR]. The refugees came to Azerbaijan in 
earlier times and are still coming. They did not always expect 
that a good destiny awaited them in Azerbaijan...But, about this 
a bit later. 
  The majority of people coming to Azerbaijan have been 
"southerners" -- Iranian Azeris. Iranian refugees came to 
Azerbaijan even during the time of Tsarist Russia. They were 
basically dissatisfied with the political situation in Iran, 
they were participants in the national liberation struggle and 
the unemployed who wished to earn money to buy a piece of bread. 
These emigrants functioned freely on the territory of Tsarist 
Russia and did what they wished. No matter that the interests of 
Tsarist Russia in Azerbaijan coincided with the interests of 
neighboring Iran, the Tsarist government was unable to send the 
refugees back, or return them to their own homeland. Even then 
domestic opinion was taken into consideration. 
  Later, during the period of Soviet Russia, even newer armies 
of refugees began to come to Azerbaijan from Iran. These, 
basically, did not accept the rule of Reza Shah and were 
national freedom fighters, headed by Heydar Emioghlu. At first, 
the Soviet state met them with great sympathy. But a few years 
later, Mirjefer Baghyrov, at Stalin's order, imprisoned these 
refugees as "doubtful persons," and returned them to Iran where 
some were hanged and some exiled to Iran's southern provinces. 
  After the S. Pishevari movement a number of members of the 
Azerbaijan Democratic Party tried to emigrate from Iran to 
Azerbaijan. At the last moment, the emigres met with automobile 
accidents, were shot, or exiled. All of this happened on the 
territory of the USSR. 
  The number of refugees did not diminish even after the 
victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran. On the contrary, they 
significantly increased. In the period after the revolution, the 
fate of the refugees coming to Azerbaijan was somewhat 
different. Only a few of these refugees, those who were 
dissatisfied with the political situation in the USSR, went back 
to Iran. (Employees of the KGB put them back over the border to 
Iran.) The Soviet state gave some of them visas and they set 
forth for the West. As for most of the refugees, normal 
conditions were established for them. In some places of 
residence, additional amenities were given to these refugees. 
The last emigre wave from Iran took place during the Elchibey 
presidency. At this time some of the refugees came with the 
desire to live in democratic, independent Azerbaijan, and 
others, simply, because their security was not guaranteed in 
Iran. And in high circles in Azerbaijan granting them 
citizenship was even discussed...[passage illegible] 
  In our opinion, if such a step were taken, it could create 
very unpleasant consequences for us. There is a notion in the 
West that the Azerbaijan Republic has little concern for the 
Helsinki Convention and UN resolutions. According to UN 
resolutions every individual has the right to live in the 
country of his choice and the ruling powers of each country are 
obligated to create normal conditions for the refugees. 
  But, at the same time, peoples of our neighbor country have 
negative feelings toward Azerbaijan, and the faith of the 
democratic forces and the national liberation movement of Iran 
in independent Azerbaijan is being shaken. 
  And finally, ties between Northern and Southern Azerbaijan 
could weaken.

<F P=106> [Article by Huseynbaba Selimov: "The War, The Authorities, </F>
The Opposition And...The Public"] 
  [Text] A question often heard from our readers and 
acquaintance is: "Could recent operations at the front mark an 
important turning point in the war?" Sometimes conditions demand 
that certain questions remain unanswered but, unfortunately, 
Azerbaijan's public, which is used to viewing all questions from 
the point of view of relations between the rulers and the 
opposition views silence itself from the same point of view... 
  We said above that sometimes conditions demand that some 
questions remain unanswered. Why? 
  First, because a word written or an idea addressed to a wide 
audience creates a definite opinion and a certain behavior as a 
consequence of this. 
  On one hand, the situation in the world is now such that to 
boast of strength is inappropriate, and advertisement or 
publicity of such efforts can only harm Azerbaijan; for more 
than five years the Armenians have attacked, taken new 
territories, driven hundreds of thousands of people from their 
lands and homes and made them refugees, and during these same 
five years the Armenians have turned to the world and said: 
"Help us, they are destroying us!" There is no need to transfer 
some positive qualities special to our nation (faithfulness, 
pride, etc.) to politics because the behavioral rules of 
politics are different... 
  They say that the triangle is the most perfect, strongest 
figure. It is certain that politics resting on three points will 
also be strong and that from this point of view one must also 
view politics from its three points and determine if its 
"strength coefficient" is adequate. If one of these points is 
the ruling group, then the other two are the opposition and the 
public. Let us begin with the public... 
<H5>  1. What Does The Public Say? </H5>
  In order to get an idea of this it is sufficient to examine 
the results of a poll conducted in the last months of 1993. 
  Eighty-three percent of those queried demanded that no 
status 
be given the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, and 12.4 percent 
mentioned the possibility of being satisfied with cultural 
autonomy. 
  In resolving the problem, 35.2 percent preferred a military 
solution, 47.6 percent a military-political solution, and just 
11.2 percent saw the way out through talks. 
  It is natural that public opinion is not stable and that 
these numbers could change by going up or down. But the result 
is in front of our eyes: the feeling of no reconciliation is 
strong among our people and this feeling can be further 
strengthened through military operations. The ruling circles 
must take this factor into consideration in their policy. 
<H5>  2. The Opposition Is Not Impeded... </H5>
  We are not going to engage in classifying the opposition in 
Azerbaijan, but a cursory view of the political forces in 
Azerbaijan brings out an interesting detail: there is a lack of 
proportion between relations to the opposition forces and their 
"security coefficient." 
  Essentially, traditional forces or, more correctly, forces 
which the ruling circle considers to be in opposition to them, 
do not make up the opposition of today. Leaders of opposition 
political forces have often said that they have organized their 
activities within the framework of the constitution and 
democratic principles, and have stated that they are taking 
Azerbaijan's military-political situation into consideration. 
The opposition today is only engaged in healthy criticism; as 
for the ruling circles, they must make the effort to make use of 
this criticism. The opposition cannot not accept a shortcoming 
of its own: a policy advanced on questions of war (in general, 
policy) must not be based on "temporary advances" but must 
advance a future-based policy by turning these into long-term, 
durable results. 
<H5>  3. Finally, The Government... </H5>
  It is impossible to advance a policy on wartime issues 
without clarifying the Armenian military-political doctrine 
(with regard to Azerbaijan). What goals are the Armenians 
keeping to in enlarging and widening its geography? 
  One: The Armenian side understands well that talks will only 
be profitable and useful for their side by controlling an ever 
larger territory and they are expanding the geography of the 
conflict with this goal; they are trying to expand not only 
outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh, but of Karabakh as a 
whole, and, by this, gain "territories which could be 
compromised" in future talks; they also wish to build a security 
zone around Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan must not forget this 
side of the issue and try to guarantee a "useful geography" for 
the talks. 
  Second: It is clear to everyone that Armenia is not only 
engaged in its own goals but also in realizing Russia's 
geopolitical plans. At one time many doubted that the Armenians 
would advance in the direction of Azerbaijan's southern borders 
and used the Iran factor as an argument. But the recent 
development of events has shown that the Armenians did advance 
toward the southern borders and met with no opposition. In our 
opinion, there is a reason for this: a situation had to be 
created wherein Azerbaijan stood before a dilemma. This dilemma 
consisted of to whom to give "control" over the southern 
borders: "Armenia" or Russia? From this point of view, although 
our military efforts have not been contradicted by definite 
"advances" in our relations with Russia, it is difficult to 
speak of real results. 
  Azerbaijan was forced to define its own "security space." It 
became a member of the CIS. And perhaps it is a result of this 
that Azerbaijan's name (or the Transcaucasus, since Georgia is 
also a member of the CIS) is not mentioned in the talks between 
two superstates -- the talks are more about regions that have 
remained outside of "security zones" such as the Baltic and 
Eastern Europe. We have selected our own destiny...Now one road 
remains: making use of contradictions within the CIS and, with 
this objective, broadening some bilateral relations. 
  Third. It was claimed at one time in Armenian propaganda 
that 
the Armenian community in our republic did not have the 
guarantees to "survive" in a totalitarian Azerbaijani state. 
Thus, the fact that Azerbaijan's name was listed among countries 
where freedom of speech was limited, human rights, etc., were 
violated could pose an obstacle to Azerbaijan's war policy. 
Unity between the ruling party and the opposition on the war 
issue has exceptional importance, and it is even necessary to 
proclaim and advertise this unity. Thus, it should refrain from 
accusations against the opposition: it could be that an 
irreconcilable relationship against opposition forces gives a 
certain effect domestically (even if this were the case, it 
would be impossible to attain longterm stability in this way), 
but from outside, from abroad, a polarized Azerbaijan as a 
political union lacks esteem; on the contrary, our "near abroad" 
can use this kind of polarization skillfully.

<F P=106> [Report by Premier V.S. Chernomyrdin at enlarged session of </F>
Russian Federation Government 4 March 1993: "The Government 
Intends To Abide by Its Program No Matter How Difficult It May 
Be"] 
  [Text] 
  Esteemed President, 
  Esteemed participants in the government session! 
  This is our first meeting in this composition in the new 
year, 1994. However, I want to stress in particular that the 
Russian Government, which is meeting today in an enlarged 
session with the participation of leaders of the regions and 
deputies of the Federal Assembly, is not a new state organ born 
in January this year. It is the same pro-reform cabinet which, 
together with the president and under his direct leadership, has 
carried out and is continuing to carry out the qualitative 
transformation of the country's economy. 
  The main directions of this multifaceted work have been 
determined in the Message of the President of Russia to the 
Federal Assembly and in effect to all Russians. The government 
fully supports the aim set out in the Message -- the 
strengthening of the Russian state. It is this which is the 
basis of the continuation of the reforms, the elimination of the 
crisis, the implementation of the structural restructuring of 
the economy, and the creation of conditions for economic, 
political, and social stabilization. 
  As far as the government is concerned, the president's 
Message is the point of departure in the formation and 
implementation of socioeconomic policy. 
  In recent weeks we have often been accused of maintaining a 
prolonged silence, of lacking an action program, and of having 
nothing to say. 
  On the one hand, there have been demands for a change of 
course. On the other hand, there has been a flurry of 
accusations that we are deviating from the reform policy. 
Chernomyrdin is being accused of constantly stating his loyalty 
to the reforms while at the same time being unprepared to prove 
that in practice. 
  I want to clearly and precisely define my position right 
now. 
  First of all we see neither a justification nor an 
opportunity for a radical change of course. 
  The government has its program, adopted 6 August 1993 and 
approved by the president. We intend to abide by this program 
and will implement it no matter how difficult that proves to be. 
  At the same time we reject in principle the dangerous theory 
of "letting things drift." We are not satisfied either with the 
pace and intensity of the reforms or with the quality of work of 
management structures at all levels -- from federal to local -- 
and we fully share the president's alarm and society's concern 
at the country's economic situation. 
  However, neither are there any grounds for hasty conclusions 
about an imminent catastrophe or that the reform has stopped and 
that it is necessary to go back to 1992 in order to "renew" the 
radical transformations. 
  I should like to recall the old saying: Do not make the same 
mistake twice. The country, the reforms, and we all are not 
what we were a year or two ago. One can and must discuss what 
has been done and what has not been done and why. But we cannot 
fail to see the obvious: A market economy already exists in 
Russia. 
  Now it is necessary to move on, not backward but forward, 
taking into account the qualitative differences in the economic 
and political situation prevailing at the start of 1994 and 
drawing the lessons from our own errors and omissions. 
<H5>  1. 1993. Trends and Lessons </H5>
  A detailed account of the characteristics of economic 
development over the past year is contained in the materials 
distributed to the participants in the session. So I would like 
to pay greater attention to the qualitative aspect of the 
results in 1993 and the government's work to implement the 
program for the development of reforms and stabilization of the 
economy. 
  In the complex domestic political situation of 1993 the 
government succeeded in taking major steps to promote the 
progress of reforms. The moderately tough financial and 
monetary policy made it possible to keep inflation under control 
and reduce it significantly by the end of 1993. Privatization 
proceeded dynamically and additional measures were adopted to 
liberalize foreign economic activity. The government did 
everything it could to support production. 
  Nevertheless, the economic situation remains alarming. At 
the end of the year the slump in industry intensified. We have 
come very close to the point of the irreversible destruction of 
our scientific and technical potential. The country's situation 
as regards foreign economic activity and hard currency remains 
tense. The problem of nonpayments has worsened again. 
  I am certainly not saying all this so as to "inflame" the 
atmosphere or to attribute all our own failings to "objective 
circumstances." We intend to draw conclusions for ourselves 
first and foremost. 
  For example, in the fight against inflation we got carried 
away by the sequestration of budget expenditure but sometimes we 
cut to the quick and did not examine in detail the consequences 
of the reduction of this or that budget item. 
  As a result the budget was not able to pay in full for 
output 
produced for the state's needs or for a number of other 
commitments, including the payment of wages in the budget-funded 
sphere. Instead of seeking reserves to strengthen the revenue 
base and rationalize expenditure, measures of a "crisis 
management" character were adopted. 
  I have to say bluntly that we sometimes fail to keep pace 
with events simply because of the low quality of work by 
ministries and departments. 
  For over a year we have been talking about the disastrous 
impact of nonpayments on the financial position of enterprises, 
the budget, and the economy as a whole and we have been issuing 
instruction after instruction. But what is the result? We 
still do not have a full, day-to-day account of reciprocal 
indebtedness in the national economy. 
  I am not saying that the problem is simple. But at times you 
get the impression that neither the Finance Ministry, nor the 
Economy Ministry, nor the State Committee for the Management of 
State Property, nor the Central Bank considers this to be its 
problem. Meanwhile the situation is getting worse day by day. 
  I want to talk in particular about sectorial ministries and 
departments. It seems at times that even now their main aim is 
to obtain money and benefits for their enterprises in the belief 
that [the constraints of] state policy and the government's real 
potential do not apply to them. Meanwhile, very little specific 
work is being done with enterprises, including work to sort out 
nonpayments, to evaluate the state of and prospects for 
enterprises, and to prepare effective recommendations for them. 
  The Finance Ministry must be reminded that it is not merely 
a 
bookkeeper and that ultimately the budget and its execution are 
among the main instruments of the government's economic policy. 
A host of grievances and mutual recriminations sometimes result 
from an elementary reluctance to explain the real situation 
regarding state finances and the reasons for harsh budget 
restrictions. I know that it is very difficult to work in this 
area today. Nevertheless, the economy does not exist for the 
sake of the Finance Ministry, the Finance Ministry exists for 
the sake of the economy. 
  Last fall we adopted the action plan to implement stage one 
of the government program. How is it being carried out? 
  An analysis has shown that only one-half of the 88 
instructions included in the plan have been implemented in full. 
Furthermore, in a number of cases that implementation is 
clearly only formal. The implementation of such fundamentally 
important decisions as, for example, agricultural 
production-sharing, the development of agricultural credit and 
insurance, and the introduction of land as a surety and 
mortgages, has been frustrated. Yet the Ministry of Agriculture 
knows that beyond these decisions lies the solution of many 
difficult problems in agriculture. 
  The leaders of ministries and departments must view the 
economy as a whole and pursue an overall state policy. By no 
means all leaders proved capable last year of resisting the 
pressure of lobby interests especially when these attacks were 
accompanied by a powerful "barrage of noise," which, 
furthermore, had political overtones. 
  I want to make one more point. It is impossible to implement 
a reform if one looks down on the country and the people and 
does not explain things or ask for the consent of those on whose 
behalf we are actually working. Or on whose behalf we should be 
working at any rate. I want our government and leaders of the 
executive organs of power in the regions to be able to see the 
country's economic problems from grass roots level -- through 
the eyes of our citizens. Then I am convinced that the majority 
of the poeople will understand and support the reforms. 
<H3>  2. Move Forward While Taking Account of Socioeconomic 
Realities </H3>
  When summing up the results not just in 1993 but also over 
the past two years of reforms, we must see first and foremost 
the new problems which the Russian economy is encountering today. 
  First, a new situation has developed over prices. Domestic 
prices for the majority of goods and services (apart from energy 
sources) have moved close to world prices. This, on the one 
hand, has helped to saturate the market and has been conducive 
to the free establishment of new economic ties and the 
development of trade and normal market relations. Russian 
enterprises have experienced the competition of foreign goods 
and a perceptible blow has been dealt to monopoly practices. 
But, on the other hand, a steadily growing number of 
enterprises are running at a loss and are proving inefficient 
and uncompetitive. 
  Second, the moderately tough financial and monetary-credit 
policy did yield definite fruit although it failed to stop 
inflation. The rate of inflation, disregarding January 1994, 
has slowed perceptibly. In February it was 13-15 percent at 
most, in other words it was at the level of November-December. 
There are grounds for hoping that we will be able to maintain 
that level in the next few months and then achieve better 
results. 
  However, I make no secret of the fact that we are alarmed by 
the asymmetrical response of the national economy to the 
measures contained in the tough monetary policy: On the one 
hand the swelling of the money supply is a powerful boost to 
inflation but, contrary to expectations, it is not leading to a 
stabilization of production and is blocking the so vital 
processes of its structural restructuring. 
  At the same time, the slowdown in the rate of growth of the 
money supply is causing a sharp slump in production and 
increasing the strain on enterprises' financial situation 
without influencing price movements. 
  This is what we have gained as a result of the powerful 
pressure on the money supply in June-October 1993. 
  Consequently it is necessary to recognize not only the fact 
that macroeconomic stabilization has not been achieved yet, but 
also that this can hardly be achieved by means of a tough 
monetary policy alone. 
  You cannot make great progress by cutting budget expenditure 
or by raising taxes alone. Nonpayments and the large tax 
arrears today are attributable not just to budget debts and the 
debts of the CIS countries but also to the extremely poor 
financial discipline and mutual lack of exactingness by partners 
who prefer to address all their claims to the government. 
People often talk about the lack of money in the economy as a 
consequence of the shock therapy policy. But the facts indicate 
otherwise: On the whole there is enough in circulation, what is 
lacking is order and the normal control of money movements. 
  Third, the slump in production in 1993 and in the opening 
months of this year proved greater than anticipated. Efficiency 
is in decline and there is a threat of mass unemployment and the 
reduction of the production apparatus. In a number of sectors 
the volume of production is less than 50 percent of the January 
1990 level. 
  Stoppages of work at production units, including such major 
enterprises as "Avtovaz," "Kirovskiy Zavod," "Baltiyskiy Zavod," 
and others have acquired a new and hitherto unseen quality. 
  The crisis has affected not just those sectors where the 
greatest reduction of production was forecast but also those 
which are producing what is, in principle, competitive output, 
output which is in demand, such as consumer goods. 
  In these conditions it is obvious that the question can no 
longer be expressed merely in terms of "more or less money." It 
is clear that without a sufficiently tough financial and 
monetary policy no progress will be made here, just as has 
happened in other countries. 
  But it is hardly possible to radically change the situation 
in the country for the better by these means alone either. 
Hence the need to use the full range of market methods of state 
regulation. 
  Thus today, while not slackening our efforts in the sphere 
of 
economic stabilization in the slightest, we must operate equally 
resolutely on other aspects of Russia's economic life. Many of 
the reserves of the reform have not been fully utilized. 
  The solution, in our opinion, is to focus efforts on the 
solution of the following main tasks: 
  -- the strengthening of state power and the imposition of 
order in all spheres of the economy and society's life; 
  -- the implementation of an intelligent, moderately tough 
financial policy; 
  -- the resolute stepping up of structural investment policy; 
  -- substantial changes to the privatization policy so as to 
direct it not simply toward the distribution of state property 
but also toward increasing production efficiency, stimulating 
investments, and stepping up the structural restructuring; 
  -- using every opportunity to intensify social policy so as 
to finally steer the reforms toward the people and eliminate the 
main sources of people's discontent; 
  -- and the consolidation of all the healthy forces in 
society 
to resolve the tasks of the new stage of the reforms and achieve 
national accord on this platform. 
  I proceed from the premise that virtually the entire range 
of 
these tasks of ours was presented in the president's message. 
That message tells us what we must do. Our duty is to 
determine how to do this and fulfill what has been planned. 
<H3>  3. Formulating Effective Mechanisms for Economic 
Stabilization </H3>
  Let me begin with the imposition of order and the 
strengthening of the state principle in the economy. The 
measures we have proposed have nothing to do with unquestioning 
administration by decree or autocratically putting the screws on. 
  It must be understood that we are not talking about 
reverting 
to the old methods of government or restoring the omnipresent 
role of the state. 
  The objective is to put an end to chaos and secure 
elementary 
things that are natural in any civilized state, but which are 
regrettably lacking in ours, namely the proper fulfillment of 
commitments to partners, the payment of taxes and debts, or 
failing that, a declaration of bankruptcy. 
  Therefore, as far as I am concerned, order is synonymous 
with 
reliable laws that work and a developed system of institutions 
which are needed for a full-fledged market economy. Let me say 
that the president's message says outright that the 
institutional avenue of reform should be the main one. 
  On the other hand, the creation of new market institutions 
effectively means the continuation in the economic sphere of the 
general guidelines for state building that Russia is 
implementing today. 
  What are the immediate urgent tasks here? 
  We will set up the missing institutions in the investment 
and 
social spheres and in the management of the domestic and foreign 
state debt, as well as support for Russian industrial exports. 
  On the other hand, it is necessary to take a careful look at 
what has been achieved by, for example, existing institutions 
like the State Investment Fund, the Financial Corporation, the 
Russian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and countless 
extrabudgetary funds. Plenty of time has already elapsed since 
they were set up. What return have these structures provided, 
especially since many of them were given the rights of 
government agents? 
  There is just one approach here -- state funds and state 
prestige must serve national economic interests. 
  Institutional transformations will be continued in the 
sphere 
of banking. The Central Bank regrettably does not always rise 
to the situation. We expect it to make specific proposals on 
how to develop the banking system. We are in favor of 
amalgamating banking capital and bringing it closer to 
production up to the point where it would be directly involved 
in the financial-industrial groups that are being formed. We 
are also in favor of lifting the unwarranted restrictions on 
participation in privatization and the investment process in 
1994. I think that life will force us to take a different 
approach to competition with foreign banks. Our bankers by no 
means benefit from "hothouse" conditions. We cannot see or feel 
any initiative, where is it? 
  Strengthening legislative backup for market reforms remains 
the government's special concern. Using its constitutional 
right of legislative initiative, the government has prepared 
over 60 top-priority draft laws for the State Duma to examine. 
Suffice it to mention the draft Civil, Commercial, and Criminal 
Codes, amendments to the laws on enterprises and on banks, draft 
laws on state monopolies, on the fundamental principles of 
self-government, on mortgages, and so on. 
  It would take too long to list all the draft laws we have 
initiated. A list of them has already been sent to the State 
Duma. What is more, it is very important that the draft federal 
constitutional law "On the Government of the Russian Federation" 
be drafted and submitted to the Duma forthwith. 
  The adoption of this law would be the culmination of the 
reorganization of the federal executive structure in line with 
the Constitution. 
  The government's work is also being restructured to preclude 
duplication and draw a distinct line between the areas of 
competence of the Presidential Administration, the Security 
Council, and executive organs at local level. To date the 
number of federal executive and state government organs has 
dropped from 93 to 77, including a fall in the number of organs 
in the Government from 37 to 23. The number of apparatus 
personnel, including government apparatus personnel, is also 
being cut. 
  Agrarian reform provides a classic example of the formation 
of new market institutions. I will be frank and say that its 
future is beginning to cause misgivings. The government's 
interest in this is supremely clear. The more intensive the 
transformations in the agrarian sector, the more effective the 
structure of ownership, the fewer problems with reform, and the 
less strain on the budget. Subsidies for agricultural producers 
are essential, but they are burdensome for the budget and often 
ineffective now. We must be realists after all! By the middle 
of last year we had not only drawn close to, but had effectively 
overstepped the mark in terms of the amount of budget aid that 
we can give agriculture without jeopardizing other sectors of 
the economy. 
  At the same time I must also mention the unscrupulous 
speculation regarding the government's policy on the agrarian 
sector. The figure of 34 trillion rubles [R] -- which 
Chernomyrdin allegedly wants to earmark for agriculture from 
budget funds -- has been brought up by someone and has begun to 
appear in the press. That is not true, I would willingly 
provide that amount, but where is it to come from? The measures 
of state support in force in 1993 will remain the same in 1994, 
but no more. 
  We are embarking on the radical reform of the whole system 
of 
state support for agriculture. We will provide money in return 
for a guaranteed result and for strictly defined purposes. 
  We must know how much food -- and of what quality -- Russian 
citizens will receive in return for the budget funds allocated. 
We will extend our support for agricultural production via the 
network of specialized credit and other market institutions: 
cooperative, mortgage, and land banks, consumer credit 
companies, and wholesale food markets. 
  Everything that I have mentioned, plus rigorous observance 
of 
the balance of powers and responsibility between the Center and 
the regions, are the main components of policy in 1994, a policy 
that is designed to streamline the economic system. 
  But there are also urgent problems that need to be resolved 
over the next two-three months. 
  These are primarily the creation of mechanisms to resolve 
the 
crisis of reciprocal nonpayments in the national economy. 
  In order to combat nonpayments the government has formulated 
additional measures to improve settlements in the national 
economy. We will introduce compulsory registration of all 
enterprises' accounts, including those abroad, and tighten up 
administrative and financial liability for concealing such 
accounts and for exceeding the timeframe for processing payment 
documents. 
  The work on converting overdue debts into bills of exchange 
will be completed in March or April. This will make it possible 
to tackle the nonpayment problem on a regular basis in line with 
the requirements of a market economy. And we will rigorously 
apply the following rule: If you do not have the money to pay 
your debts, your property is forefeit. It is time that 
creditors learned to recover their debts via the courts and not 
put their trust in "kind uncles" in the government. 
  However, resolving the problem of nonpayment and collecting 
taxes in full is not just the task of the Federal Government. 
The Central Bank of Russia is being intolerably slow in its 
work to create a reliable, fast payment system based on 
interbank clearing and the use of modern technical facilities 
and new means of payment. Controls have been relaxed with 
regard to the activity of commercial banks which "hold" to their 
own advantage money which enterprises have paid to cover 
reciprocal debts or in taxes. Tough, prompt steps must be taken 
here. Consider this both a request and an instruction to the 
Central Bank leadership. 
  The economic situation requires a resolute enhancement of 
the 
effectiveness of financial policy. 
  We cannot allow ourselves the luxury of living for two years 
without a ratified budget, to all intents and purposes amid 
financial lawlessness. Therefore the number one task is to 
complete the work on the draft budget for 1994. 
  The key task here remains to prevent the budget deficit 
rising through inflationary sources of funding. The main means 
of stopping this is to reduce the rate of inflation to 7-9 
percent by the end of the year and the federal budget deficit to 
no more than 9-10 percent of GDP. 
  I would point out that these parameters must be regarded as 
the maximum permissible levels -- particularly in terms of the 
level of inflation -- as a kind of "minimum program." When 
implementing the budget and carrying out other measures, we will 
actively seek reserves which make it possible to consistently 
move toward the figure of 3-5 percent inflation by the end of 
the year mentioned in the president's message. 
  Needless to say, this represents a fairly tight framework 
especially since we have to pay in full the debts carried over 
from 1993. 
  Regrettably, this year too we will be unable to avoid 
sequestration. But how are we to approach this? A simple 
repetition of last year's method, using the principle of 
something for everyone, can only aggravate the situation. 
  We may "lose" all structural and investment policy if we do 
not carry out a detailed preliminary analysis of the financial 
situation in each sphere of budget funding and the consequences 
of a further reduction in spending. And we have no right to 
permit that now. 
  The structure of budget spending and the mechanism for 
funding this spending are being substantially reformed. 
  Extremely tight supervision is being established to ensure 
that budget appropriations reach their destination promptly and 
are used for their prescribed purpose. The results of 1993 
showed that state funds by no means always reach those for whom 
they were destined. As happened, for instance, with the budget 
loans to cover grain procurements, which were used by 
Roskhleboprodukt to fund its current spending. 
  Beginning in March, the Ministry of Finance will be 
responsible for delivering monthly reports to the government 
regarding the results of inspections to verify that budget 
appropriations have reached their destination. 
  A government commission will carry out similar inspections 
regarding the utilization of centralized credit resources. The 
situation here, as you know, is even worse: The recipient 
receives the money every six months, or not at all. Things are 
particularly bad with regard to credits for "shipments to the 
North." 
  Funding of targeted social security, along with support for 
certain sectors of industry, the agro-industrial complex, the 
fuel and energy complex, and the investment complex remain a 
priority in state spending in 1994. 
  It is envisaged that over 20 percent of all budget spending 
will be channeled into these areas. Spending on financial 
support for the regions is up from 10 to 13.4 percent. Compared 
with 1993 appropriations for payment of wages in the 
budget-funded sphere are also up (from 6.7 to 7.2 percent). 
  Financial stabilization cannot be ensured without an 
effective /tax system./ It is here that the main reserves for 
raising budget revenue are concentrated. 
  The government regards the following as priority tasks: 
ensuring the stability of the tax system, considerably 
simplifying and streamlining taxation procedures, abolishing 
individual concessions to enterprises and regions, and 
reinforcing the tax service. 
  At the same time we will improve tax legislation in order to 
ensure that it helps to support commodity producers and 
stimulate investments. 
  That will ultimately enable us to avoid introducing new 
taxes 
and levies and reduce the overall burden of taxation. 
  Tax arrears and extremely poor financial discipline are 
still 
the major problem. The situation here is not merely 
intolerable, but effectively an emergency. In 1993 alone the 
federal budget failed to receive R7.5 trillion or 30 percent of 
the total predicted revenue. 
  Enterprises' and organizations' tax arrears which are 
increasing every month amid the ongoing nonpayments crisis are 
particularly alarming. In January 1994 alone the federal budget 
was owed almost R1 trillion in tax arrears. 
  These figures conceal a scandalous situation, one that 
affects virtually all sectors of the national economy, moreover. 
In the fuel and energy complex, in particular, in the last six 
months alone tax avoidance has been revealed to total R200 
billion! Especially major irregularities have been revealed at 
the "Kirishinefteorgsintez," "Permneft," and "Orenburgneft" 
Production Associations and other enterprises. Thus an audit at 
the "Kirishinefteorgsintez" Production Association revealed that 
hard-currency profits had been concealed along with major 
irregularities in financial documentation. The budget has 
recovered around R13 billion, including fines. 
  Nevertheless, the tax service and the tax police still have 
an extremely low success rate. Since it spends a considerable 
amount of money on over 135,000 personnel in these organs, the 
state has a right to expect them to be more effective in 
suppressing tax crime and in collecting the state revenue due in 
full and on time. 
  I would particularly like to dwell on the radical 
restructuring of budget relations with the regions, which is one 
of the main areas of financial policy in 1994. 
  The new system of budget federalism will be based on unified 
rules whereby state spending and revenue are to be allocated 
among the federal budget and the budgets of Federation 
components. With no exceptions. That will make it possible to 
avoid unnecessary centralization of spending and to create a 
real revenue base for federal and regional budget autonomy. 
  The main principles and avenues for the reform of budget 
relations have been laid down in the president's message and his 
22 December 1993 edict. Our task is to work out forthwith a 
coordinated mechanism for their implementation in the 1994 
budget. 
  To wind up the subject of the budget I would like to 
underline particularly the following point: To all intents and 
purposes in this document we have tried for the first time in 
many years to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. It is 
all there for the public to see: How much we have at our 
disposal, how we intend to handle what we have got. The 
government has no "secret hiding places." Let us act on the 
basis of reality and learn to live according to our means. 
There is no, and there will be no other option. 
  The choice is an extremely tough one: If we allow 
hyperinflation, we will break into a flat spin from which there 
is no escape. If we stop production, we will end up with a 
country in ferment, amid collapse and chaos. Thus, we have to 
literally walk on a knife edge and show strength of character in 
order to prevent any breakdown. That is the main question today, 
  Structural-investment policy is taking center stage today 
among the priorities of economic reform. Very many industrial 
enterprises have found themselves in an extremely difficult 
situation -- either they reorganize production and find 
themselves a real long-term foothold in the market or they close 
down, forever. I think that everyone is aware of the social 
consequences of this choice, which may be an extremely common 
phenomenon. 
  This is why the state simply no longer has the right to 
remain aloof. We have no more resources. Financial 
restrictions are becoming tighter and tighter. But we must 
therefore start the maneuvers that will in time enable us to 
expand the frontiers and create the conditions for stable growth. 
  The national economy already has certain resources in the 
form of private savings. But they are not geared to production 
investment in current conditions without state support. At the 
same time the amount of budget spending on state investment is 
far inferior to subsidies and grants and, at the same time, the 
bulk of this money is invested in facilities with a dubious 
return, to put it mildly. This is an impasse from which we must 
extricate ourselves. 
  We will first embark on the radical redistribution of budget 
funds into state investment. To total 3 percent of GDP (up from 
1.7 percent). Three-fourths of budget funds destined for 
capital investment will be used to fund the construction of 
federal installations within the framework of the corresponding 
state programs. Naturally, we must review the list of these 
installations and considerably tighten our belts. 
  Without abandoning our avowed priorities in structural 
policy 
we are now switching to a more specific "point-by-point" 
definition of these priorities. Investment policy in 1994 is 
being adjusted with an eye to this. Around 40 of the 66 federal 
programs that have already been ratified and submitted to the 
government this year will be implemented. At the same time we 
are revising the procedure for the provision of subsidies and 
grants. They will drop from 9 to 7.4 percent of total budget 
spending in 1994. And that is not the end. 
  It is also necessary to learn that state investments are not 
only investments in capital construction but also in enterprise 
reorganization, improvement of management, scientific 
developments, the development of a sales network and marketing 
services, and personnel training. Small investments in 
"eliminating" countless difficulties and adapting enterprises to 
market requirements that will bring a return in a year or two 
can more rapidly ensure a breakthrough in the production sphere. 
  We cannot further delay work to shut down ineffective 
production units. We already have a list of enterprises whose 
viability is to be checked out. Many will simply have to be 
shut down. Needless to say, we will do that in our own good 
time, mindful of people's interests, the state of cities and 
regions, and opportunities for creating new jobs. It will be a 
hard decision. But it must be done. 
  The government will help in carrying out major investment 
projects involving private capital that are of fundamental 
importance for the future of the Russian economy. We have 
something to offer the private sector and foreign investors. We 
already have projects for housing construction, the construction 
of toll highways and bridges, and the development of civil 
aviation and the automobile industry, projects whose 
implementation will provide hundreds of thousands of extra jobs 
by forming new markets and reviving business activity in these 
and associated sectors -- namely the development of highway 
machine building, the construction industry, and so on. 
  It is particularly important that real conditions should 
emerge for major resettlement programs in many parts of the 
Chernozem Zone, the Nonchernozem Zone, and the Urals, for 
instance, which people left in order to open up new areas and 
build industrial complexes in the former USSR republics, and so 
on. 
  I think that state funds will bring the greatest return if 
they are provided on commercial principles, via banks and other 
financial institutions. It is these institutions that can 
select, professionally formulate, and evaluate investment 
projects, invest their own resources and those they have 
enlisted in these projects, and bear economic accountability for 
their effective use as scheduled. 
  I must say that banks and entrepreneurs are already 
beginning 
to show interest in this work. I have got to sign a government 
decree which envisages measures to stimulate private investment 
organized by a consortium of Russian banks and entrepreneurs. 
It is intended to provide state guarantees for private 
investment in projects they have chosen in conjunction with the 
Russian Ministry of the Economy. New proposals of this kind 
must be implemented and formulated without fail. 
  I take this opportunity today to urge entrepreneurs, 
bankers, 
and leaders of major joint-stock companies, in a word, Russian 
business people to be bolder in participating in investment 
projects and enlisting capital to our Russian market. And there 
are projects in which to invest. Splendid projects, 
interesting, highly profitable projects in which investors can 
recoup their investment. The government will do all this and 
will be accountable, jointly with you, for the results. 
  I am convinced that only then will foreign investors be 
bolder and more confident about following your lead. 
  The result being that we will obtain what the country needs 
so badly today -- highly productive labor, "high" technologies, 
modern machinery and equipment, and production discipline and 
order that are up to world standards. And we will therefore be 
able to produce output that society really needs, output that 
will not be afraid of competition on either the home or the 
foreign markets. 
  I am convinced that we can achieve this by joint efforts. 
  During the next stage of reform one of the most important 
instruments for the structural restructuring of the economy, 
which is proceeding by strengthening the institutions of private 
ownership, is /privatization./ 
  By 1 July we must complete the program of mass (check) 
privatization. This means that we must provide every Russian 
citizen with an opportunity to invest vouchers in shares in 
enterprises or investment funds, in plots of land, and other 
facilities. 
  A new phase of privatization policy will start as of the 
second half of the year. During this phase the main form of 
privatization will be commercial and, most importantly, 
investment tenders with fairly tough terms which ensure the 
reorganization and modernization of enterprises and the 
requisite flow of investment, including from abroad. 
  The progress of privatization is undoubtedly one of the most 
important criteria by which one can judge the extent to which 
the Russian economy is acquiring market qualities. From this 
viewpoint it is extremely important to ensure that in 1994 
privatization becomes a kind of locomotive of reform at 
microlevel. We must bring reform to enterprise level and 
consolidate it via real changes in the economic behavior of 
Russian commodity producers. 
  In order to achieve this it is necessary to, first, launch 
mechanisms for financial recovery and bankruptcies at 
enterprises that are recognized to be insolvent debtors, which 
are essentially unnecessary and operating at a loss. 
  Second, it is a question of postprivatization support for 
enterprises. One "sound" plan based on the "LOMO" Association 
in St. Petersburg is already prepared. I know that another 12 
similar projects are in the offing. That is something. But 
efforts must be stepped up. In 1994 we must create a continuous 
flow of projects to restructure enterprises. We will use 
foreign credits provided by the G-7, the World Bank, and the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for this 
purpose. 
  The purpose of all our privatization efforts today is to 
move 
away from distributing and redistributing property to creating 
the conditions to enhance the effectiveness and competitiveness 
of production, improve management, and stimulate investment. 
There are tremendous reserves here and we must utilize them. 
<H5>  4. Carrying Out Reform for People </H5>
  It should be acknowledged that social policy has proved to 
be 
a weak point in the government's work. Such a situation cannot 
be tolerated any more and must be rectified forthwith. 
  The majority of citizens should feel that the reforms are 
bringing real benefits to them, their families, and the people 
around them and that the full burden of the crisis is being 
borne not only by ordinary working people but also by those who 
-- in the new conditions -- have drastically shot ahead in terms 
of prosperity. 
  We are, of course, carrying out reform not in order that 
"there be no rich" but, on the contrary, in order that there be 
no poor. But we have no right either to allow a ten- to 
elevenfold gap to develop in incomes and standard of living 
between the lowest-income and highest-income groups of the 
population and let Russia become the world record holder in this 
regard. 
  Reform should be not just economically effective but also 
socially just! 
  In this regard the government has recently been working on 
the formulation of a more vigorous social policy course. You 
have been issued with the draft Basic Guidelines of Social 
Policy of the Russian Federation for 1994, supported by a list 
of priority tasks. Incidentally, several of them have already 
been implemented. 
  Seeking to ensure that social policy take more specific 
account of the interests of all strata of the population, the 
government intends first and foremost to enhance targeted 
support for the disadvantaged and strengthen the financial base 
of the relevant funds. Recalculation of the old-style pensions 
will start on 1 April 1994, in accordance with the president's 
edict. The new pensions law, the draft of which will be 
submitted to the Federal Assebly for examination, will be the 
next step aimed at improving pensioners' material position. 
  It is extremely necessary to do everything possible to 
ensure 
that priority is given to veterans and those people who simply 
cannot wait for an overall solution of the problem during the 
process of /gradually restoring the savings/ of citizens. Some 
of the savings could and indeed must be restored by transferring 
some state property -- shares, state enterprises, and land -- to 
depositors. The government is now working on this task. 
  Unemployment has become tangible. There is still relatively 
little overt unemployment, but almost 4 million people are now 
working part time. And we must be prepared for an upsurge in 
the problems of unemployment in the immediate future -- we must 
be prepared in psychological, material, and organizational 
terms. It is essential to start considering right now in 
specific terms the organization of public works, particularly 
the construction of housing, roads, bridges, and other socially 
important facilities. I am repeating myself again, but I do 
regard this as extremely important. We will give priority 
support to all private capital initiatives in this sphere. 
  The government intends/to intensify incomes policy/ 
substantially, we will introduce tougher progressive taxation of 
high and very high incomes and the declaration of incomes when 
carrying out major purchases, and will make changes to the 
taxation of real estate. 
  The procedure for regulating enterprises' outlay on labor 
remuneration is being changed. The gap between the wages of 
enterprise directors and the wages of the bulk of the workers -- 
which is sometimes gigantic -- must be closed. It is 
unacceptable when the average wage of a worker is 50,000 rubles 
[R] while the director allocates himself 3-4 million for his 
vacation. 
  The introduction of an official subsistence level and the 
linking of the size of the minimum wage and minimum pension to 
it will be an important step. The country's financial position 
does not permit their equalization during 1994. However, the 
government does consider the creation of conditions for their 
subsequent harmonization to be one of its most important tasks. 
  And one more thing I would like to say. Is there anyone at 
local level and in the sector departments thinking about what 
people will do if their plant goes bankrupt or production comes 
to a halt? 
  They may have skilled hands, a clear brain, and an enormous 
desire to work, but a host of bans, restrictions, and 
bureacratic obstacles prevent their opening up a "business" -- 
the business may be small but it could develop with time into a 
major production unit of Russia-wide importance. I see the 
government's task here as being to remove as quickly as possible 
all obstacles to displays of initiative, enterprise, and hard 
work by our citizens. 
  Today we should promote the task of drastically boosting 
housing construction and making the acquisition of housing 
easier for the population, particularly for low-income groups. 
This is, in the full meaning of the word, a nationwide task. A 
package of decrees has already been adopted on the development 
of a system for granting credit in the housing sphere and on 
subsidies for the construction and acquisition of housing, 
including subsidies to people on waiting lists, servicemen, and 
others in preferential categories. But this is extremely 
little. In future we intend to increase out efforts, developing 
above all extrabudgetary forms of investment in housing 
construction, attracting private capital and foreign investment 
into this sphere, and bringing new credit and mortgage 
mechanisms into operation. 
  It has to be honestly admitted that today we are not in a 
position to repay in full from the federal budget all that is 
owed to the spheres of science, education, and culture, notably 
as regards compliance with the president's edict No. 1. This is 
both our misfortune and our pain. I consider that it is 
impossible for the regions either to stand aloof from this now. 
At the same time, while I do understand the sense of 
dissatisfaction felt by higher education lecturers, students, 
and staffers of scientific institutes, I have to say frankly 
that the system of science and higher education will not survive 
without rationalization of their activity, sensible 
redistribution of resources, and jettisoning of superflous 
tiers. A selective approach is also required here -- the best 
must be kept. 
  The underfinancing of social expenditure is a very serious 
question. But there is also another aspect too. The 
preparation of documents and decisions aimed at radically 
reforming the social sphere has been dragged out intolerably and 
the new mechanisms for social protection and the implementattion 
of incomes policy are being developed and introduced into 
practice extremely slowly. I want to draw the attention of 
ministers with a social brief to this. 
  Fighting crime is our nationwide social, political, and -- I 
would also say -- economic priority task. 
  I would like to convey to you our serious concern over the 
current state of law and order in the country and the ability of 
the authorities to counter the aggression of the criminal world. 
There are still to date very, very few real and, most 
importantly, effective measures capable of easing the tension 
surrounding the growing threats to society and to people's life, 
health, and property. Russians have the right to expect and 
demand more from us all. 
  I will refer to just a few trends, first and foremost those 
in the economic sphere. 
  The danger of organized crime and corruption is growing. 
According to the figures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
criminal associations control at least 40,000 businesses, 
including buisnesses in the state sector. The unprecedented 
scale of criminal activity in the finance and banking systems is 
causing special alarm. We estimate that the damage now runs 
into hundreds of billions of rubles. 
  All this is no longer just a list of unpleasant facts. What 
we have here is a dangerous trend toward the malignant 
degeneration of a number of pieces of the living tissue of the 
economy. We see the danger and will block it. 
  We are carrying out tough measures aimed at freeing state 
structures from the influence of mafia elements, organized 
crime, and corrupt individuals. We will act regardless of the 
person involved, as it were. 
  We are also implementing the task put forward in the 
president's message of taking all necessary financial, cadre, 
and organizational measures necessary to ensure the normal 
operation of the law enforcement organs. We will be doing all 
within our power to ensure that the just-adopted federal 
anticrime program operates to its full potential. 
  Esteemed participants in the session, 
  the government bears a great responsibility today -- 
responsibility for the progress of reform, its cost to the 
millions of people, and for the political temperature of the 
young Russian democracy, which is going through the difficult 
period of its self-determination both in this country and the 
world. 
  Each week this year will see this responsibility merely 
augmented by more and more facets. 
  We do not have classic "government parties" in our country. 
Nor do we have monotonous "orthodoxy" subject to some kind of 
party discipline. We have already gone through all that. There 
are parties whose representatives work in the cabinet on a 
professional basis. In presenting to society today our 
understanding of the tasks at the new stage of reform we can see 
that they are in keeping with the demands and manifestos of many 
parties and movements. And it follows from this that political 
consolidation and national accord are gaining real ground in 
Russia today. 
  I would like to express the hope that the State Duma's act 
of 
political and economic amnesty will, for all the differences in 
interpretation of that decision, nevertheless become a step 
toward reconciliation and not signify another spiral in 
confrontation and destabilization of the situation in society. 
  The president and the government stand as firm guarantors 
ensuring that no such development of events occurs. 
  I cannot today avoid touching on a problem that is extremely 
important both for me personally and for the government I head. 
The point is that a noisy campaign has recently been launched by 
some mass media organs aimed at "convicting" the government 
chairman of concentrating power, of taking too much upon 
himself, and of virtually organizing plots to take over the 
presidency. Even some polls have begun to be organized on this 
topic. 
  Let me tell you honestly and frankly that I am not one of 
those versatile "whizz kids" who can immediately leap from being 
laboratory head to being a minister and then president. 
  First: Russia is not a racing car and I have not gotten 
behind its wheel, taken it for a spin, and then gotten out of 
it, leaving the whole country trembling as if suffering from a 
fever. 
  Second, I consider it impossible and simply unethical to 
hold 
any discussion on the presidency while there is a president in 
office. We have a nationwide leader elected by all the people, 
and I have no intention of scheming against him. 
  And, third, attempts to drive a wedge between the president 
and the chairman and cause us to fall out are in vain. It won't 
work. There is no point in trying. 
  We all need accord today. All branches of power and all 
leaders, whichever posts they occupy, need it. Accord is 
essential for all the people. 
  All the conditions for this are in place. There is the new 
Constitution. There is the president, who acts as a reliable 
guarantor of reforms and stability. There are the bases of the 
concept of national development formulated in the president's 
Message. There is parliament, which, for all the diversity of 
views on the country's present and future represented in it, 
aims to secure Russia's strategic interests. There is the 
government, which is committed to the president's course and is 
open to businesslike cooperation and professional work with 
everyone who is ready and really want this. 
  There is finally the Russians' common desire to revive the 
country as a great, powerful, and prosperous state. 
  This year promises to see the development and strengthening 
of many healthy economic processes. There is therefore every 
reason to hope that the gradual stabilization of the economy and 
normalization of life will finally become a tangible reality for 
miliions of people. 
  For all this to happen we have to think more about work 
today. Strict dicipline, order, and a sense of responsibility 
are absolutely essential to us. 
  All of us must really shake ourselves up and realize that 
what we need today is to create and work, ditching old relations 
and old production units while maintaining and supporting modern 
high-tech production and the fundamental sciences, for otherwise 
we will fall into the trap of stagflation, which will lead in 
turn to the total degradation of the whole economy 
  We must not fall below the start-up level so essential if a 
powerful upsurge in the industrialization of the country is to 
be launched. 
  Although certain "friends" very much wish this upon us. 
  We cannot allow the people of a country, which possesses 
powerful resources and all that is required for [economic] 
reproduction, to live in poverty -- that is a crime, a crime 
which can be neither explained nor understood. 
  I appeal to members of the government, the leaders of 
departments, the intelligentsia, and academics -- we must create 
the conditions and mechanisms for free labor, and we need to do 
this quickly, without delay. 
  I appeal to parliamentarians and the two speakers of the 
chambers -- we expect of you the laws and statutes that are so 
essential and necessary, and also perhaps provisional statutes 
at times during this transitional period -- the main thing is 
that work should not stop. 
  I appeal to our labor collectives in all regions of the 
country -- the difficulties we face are enormous, but trying to 
solve them by strikes and stoppages is a delusion, it will only 
make the situation of your families and friends worse rather 
than improving it. That is not what is required today -- we 
must all stand firm together, that way we will pull through. 
  We need less moaning and whining today and more initiative 
and self-discipline. That is the only way we will be able to 
pull out of the spin we are in, gain height, and develop a 
cruising speed for reforms. 
  This is where I today see the thrust of the government's 
work 
in 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Livshits, head of Russian </F>
presidential group of experts, by political observer Vitaliy 
Golovachev; date, place not given: "Aleksandr Livshits: `Price 
of Reform Must Be Reduced'" -- first three paragraphs are 
introduction] 
  [Text] Doctor of Economic Sciences Professor Aleksandr 
Livshits has been appointed to a key post that has a direct 
bearing on the implementation of reforms. He has become head of 
the Russian presidential group of experts and is, in effect, one 
of Boris Yeltsin's main economic advisers. 
  Aleksandr Livshits recently taught at Moscow's Machine Tool 
and Instrument Building Institute -- he was head of the Economic 
Theory Department. He wrote the textbook "An Introduction to 
the Market Economy" [Vvedeniye v Rynochnuyu Ekonomiku] (1990). 
He has spent the last two years working at the presidential 
administration's Analysis Center. He was responsible for 
formulating the economic section of Boris Yeltsin's draft 
message to the Federal Assembly. 
  In an exclusive interview with TRUD Aleksandr Livshits said 
the following: 
  [Livshits] We will not only analyze objectively the course 
of economic reform, but will also forecast the results of 
proposed decisions and point to any possible adverse results. 
The group of experts' tasks include proposing specific measures 
to prevent events taking an undesirable turn. 
  [Golovachev] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, the president's message 
says that the state should repay its debts (which currently run 
into many trillions) and at the same time prevent a rise in 
inflation. How can it perform these incompatible tasks? 
  [Livshits] First, the debts must not be repaid straightaway, 
but gradually. But it is absolutely essential that they be 
repaid. The state debt is a hallowed concept: It must be 
repaid, particularly as regards wages and other payments. 
  Second, there are noninflationary means of swelling state 
funds, which I think the government will announce in the near 
future. Specifically, by expanding the consumer market and 
reforming the state sector. 
  [Golovachev] Many specialists consider that the government 
and Yegor Gaydar in particular, made a major miscalculation in 
abandoning state enterprises to the will of fate for two years 
while the state -- their owner -- dodged managing them, putting 
its trust in the "unseen hand of the market." 
  [Livshits] Of course this was a miscalculation. State 
property ended up a kind of no-man's-land, more often than not 
the director's patch. The market is still weak and the owner 
(the state) is not managing his enterprises. And now look at 
the result -- disorganization, nonpayment, a very serious 
situation.... But we do have experience of managing state 
enterprises, and considerable experience at that. We now have 
to rectify the situation. 
  Let me say that management means, in particular, creating 
favorable conditions for attracting mixed (private and state) 
capital for structural restructuring and investments, it means 
rescue and rehabilitation packages, bankruptcies, support for 
promising enterprises, well-considered cadre and pricing policy, 
and so on. 
  [Golovachev] The president's message to the Federal Assembly 
made fairly tough assessments of the activity of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's government. "The government was unable to impose 
the requisite order" (with state enterprises). "The downside of 
the reform was attributable to mistakes by the bodies of state 
power responsible for reform. The government took poor account 
of the consequences of some decisions, postponed the adoption of 
others, was slow to make overdue corrections to reform.... The 
pause in reformation became protracted." "In two years of 
reform the government has simply been unable to elaborate an 
effective structural policy. This inaction will cost the 
Russian economy dear." And so on. The following question 
arises: Has the government exhausted its potential? What is 
your view? 
  [Livshits] We will be able to answer this question in the 
near future. Let us see how skillfully the government performs 
its new tasks. I personally am confident that the government 
still has tremendous potential. 
  [Golovachev] What do you see as the main problem today? 
  [Livshits] The main point is to ensure that the price of 
market transformations is not too great for society. So far we 
have, regrettably, failed in that. That is why the president's 
message raised the following important task: "Without reducing 
the pace of reform, market transformations must be rendered less 
burdensome for society." 
  [Golovachev] One last question. Being totally sincere, do 
you believe in success, in other words that it is possible to 
start getting out of the hole without reducing the standard of 
living further? 
  [Livshits] I am convinced of that although this task is a 
very difficult one today. But it is reassuring that mutual 
understanding with the State Duma and its Committee for Economic 
Policy is growing stronger. The day before yesterday we held a 
press conference with Sergey Glazyev, head of this committee. I 
would like to hope that we will attend future briefings as a 
trio -- with a government leader as well. 
  We have no other option. If we do not secure the 
preconditions for economic stabilization this year by joint 
effort, the country may find itself beset by tremendous 
upheaval. I believe that we will not permit this, common sense 
will prevail.

<F P=106> [Article in two installments by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy under </F>
the rubric "Concept": "A Different Kind of Reform: An Alternate 
Strategy for the Transition Period Is Possible"] 
<H5>  [10 Feb p 4] </H5>
  [Text] The reform that began in 1992 consisted of several 
main elements. 
  Stabilization of the ruble and the budget, and ruble 
convertibility. The result: 25-30 percent inflation, a real 
budget deficit amounting to 20 percent of GNP, and the ruble 
exchange rate in relation to the dollar has fallen from 100 to 
1,600 rubles [R]. 
  Privatization: In the current year the decline in production 
constitutes around 50 percent of 1989's [production]; investment 
in industry in 1993 was close to zero, while the outflow of hard 
currency to the West amounted to $15 billion. 
  Improving management: The ranks of staff employed by the 
central executive authority have swelled by a factor of five to 
six. 
  Crime, corruption... 
  Perhaps it is time to thank the reformers and, without 
emotion, answer the question of how to proceed with reforms from 
now on so that at least at some time in the future we will get 
different results. 
  The content of the book "Lessons of Economic Reform" is not 
a 
correction to the course of reform, not an exhortation for "more 
therapy and less shock" as is currently promoted by some people 
in the government and opposition politicians. It is a 
principally different transition period strategy. Its meaning is 
not in the self-withdrawal of the government but, on the 
contrary, in active actions by it in the area of 
demonopolization, the creation of a competitive environment, and 
privatization, with a serious accent on protection of property 
and development of national industry, as well as the creation of 
a financial system supporting savings, capital investment, and 
growth, which is the only road to true financial stabilization. 
  The book "Lessons of Economic Reform," which presents a new 
understanding of reforms in the most complete and structured 
form, is now being readied for a second edition. 
<H5>  1. Failure--of the Free Market or the Government? </H5>
  Let us summarize a few things. Standard economic recipes 
were 
applied to the institutional, market, financial, and political 
structures of Russia as they have been formed over 75 years in 
the environment of a planned socialist system; they consisted of 
deregulation, liberalization, and financial stabilization. As a 
result, the perception of a closed vicious circle has emerged in 
the economy; effectiveness dropped dramatically, and prospects 
disappeared over the horizon. Blood was spilled in the country. 
In this chaos it is very difficult to distinguish what 
constitutes a change for the better (contains in it the seeds of 
future development of a normal free market economy), and what is 
an obvious weed that may overcome and destroy all the good 
plants if nothing is done. 
  There is absolutely no doubt, however, that the outcome has 
very little in common with what the official reformers and 
Western well-wishers had hoped to obtain. 
  I am frequently asked what I think is wrong in the 
reformers' 
economic policy in the postsocialist countries of the former 
Soviet Union and what, in my opinion, should be corrected. 
Actually, I do not know the best answer. Imagine that you are an 
artist and you are shown a painting created by someone whose 
main problem is that the idea is not coming through. And then 
you are asked to correct, improve, this work. In all probability 
you will refuse and say that the only thing that can be done is 
to take a blank sheet and try to draw everything from scratch. 
  Economic reform in a big country is not a case where you can 
throw away everything that has been done so far and start with a 
blank sheet. The misfortune of Russia and the other former 
republics of the Soviet Union is that the "picture" of reforms 
until now was being painted and is still being painted by 
absolutely different people. When the government is in a state 
such as it had been in the former Soviet Union and Russia over 
the past few years, it is very difficult to decide what is 
worse: trust the authorities or take the risk of going into the 
still "unknown country" of the failure of the Russian market. 
This truly is a Hamletian question, because in the Russian 
economy today problems are being created both by the market and 
by the government. 
  The market is failing because technological monopolies are 
keeping prices and distortions in the area of wealth at a level 
that sometimes even exceeds the old distortions of the planned 
economy. The market is failing because property relations are 
not defined clearly; because market agents do not think 
strategically; and because there are no institutions that would 
ensure free and fair access to information resources, as well as 
competition in most markets. 
  The government is failing because it has not been able to 
give up regulation. It still interferes in the economy, and by 
arbitrary and ineffective methods at that. The system that 
rationalized this interference in a planned economy and the 
entire rationale for this interference have disappeared, but the 
fragments of the old system may still be found here and there, 
except that now the primary role they play is that of a life 
support, providing "quite a nice life" first and foremost for 
corrupt bureaucrats. 
  The government is failing because it cannot control the 
budget and money; cannot get things in order; cannot force 
economic agents to play by established rules and, moreover, 
cannot itself refrain from changing the rules from day to day. 
  So, will we not perhaps improve the situation by choosing 
free market instead of government interference? After all, the 
free market has self-correction mechanisms, and many failures of 
the system would be alleviated, provided the government had the 
will to truly remove itself from the scene. For instance, 
getting rid of arbitrary licensing, regulation, subsidies, and 
investment could put an end to a considerable part of 
corruption. This is the last bastion that needs to be conquered 
(from the position of those who insist on total liberalism). 
  My answer to this may be divided into two parts. First, even 
if it were desirable, this is impossible, because Russia is not 
the United States of Thomas Jefferson. One of the legacies of 
communism is a very complex, extremely unreliable 
industrial-technological potential (not to mention the stockpile 
of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons), which produced 
Chernobyl and may produce many others if the government does 
indeed decide to "resign" completely. It is also impossible 
because the time frame and costs of a reform based solely of 
market self-regulation will be so immense that they may exceed 
even the Russian people's famous capacity for patience. 
  I am literally very distraught over concerns about the 
"Weimarization" of the situation in East Europe--for instance, 
in Hungary--which serious politicians and scholars voice 
increasingly often. The socioeconomic situation in Russia is 
several times worse, and, correspondingly, the threat to its new 
institutions of political freedom and democracy is several times 
greater. But if political freedom and democracy fail in Russia, 
the entire world will feel the consequences. Therefore we must 
be very responsible in our professional assessment of the 
situation and in our actions. And the most important lesson we 
must draw from the experience of the past two to three years is 
that the state still should play a substantial role during the 
transition period. 
  Second, in the current political conditions in Russia, no 
matter who is the head of the government, it is practically 
impossible for them to do anything constructive. I respect and 
have high regard for some members of the Russian government. 
Nevertheless, I feel that on the whole we should not expect 
anything good from the current Russian government because of the 
bottomlessness of the political crisis. 
  When Prime Minister B. Chernomyrdin was asked a question 
about the well-remembered July exchange of banknotes, he 
answered with the remarkable candor that I like so much in many 
current Russian politicians. "We wanted to do what is best," he 
said, "but the result was as usual." This was echoed by the 
statement of a prominent Russian businessman: "We really can 
depend on our government: If it can do anything to worsen the 
economic situation, it will." 
  This second point does not necessarily mean desperation. On 
the contrary, for me at least it means only one thing--political 
conditions must be changed, and a new government that will be 
able to work effectively must come to power. How to achieve this 
is a separate topic. Therefore, permit me at this point to 
bypass this problem and go on to describe what kind of 
purposeful transformation is still possible in the current 
conditions. 
  Our challenge to most economists' perceptions regarding the 
general concept of transforming the postsocialist economy will 
consist of the following: 
  1) It is impossible to achieve macroeconomic stabilization 
before a sizable and real private sector emerges in the economy 
and structural and institutional restructuring takes place. 
  Macroeconomic stabilization as a goal placed ahead of 
everything else was a fallacious strategy from the very 
beginning (see DIAGNOSIS, EPIcenter, May 1992). A planned 
economy is an economy specially set up to function without money 
in its true sense. Therefore it does not react to a tighter 
macroeconomic policy the way it is described in textbooks. In 
reality, for all practical purposes it does not react positively 
to macroeconomic regulation altogether, and if there is any 
reaction at all, it is very distorted, superficial, and very 
often--as in the case of foreign currency exchange 
rates--artificial. 
  This may seem an exaggeration on our side, but it is a fact. 
And although certain market elements have emerged in the 
economy, the bulk of it remains untransformed, and therefore we 
are currently unable to do anything serious about either the 
budget deficit or inflation. 
  2) It is impossible to correct disproportions in relative 
prices, create the correct motivation for producers, and reduce 
the loss of public wealth by merely removing controls and 
freeing prices. 
  In order for Adam Smith's "invisible hand" to bring the 
desired results, we, again, need institutional and structural 
changes, including a resolution of the main issue--property; 
real implementation of land reform; demonopolization of the 
economy--first and foremost, liquidation of technological 
monopolies--and at least the first signs of competition; freeing 
enterprises from the burden of financing the social sphere; and 
many other measures. 
  Otherwise the disproportions that existed before will 
remain. 
Moreover, new disproportions are added to existing ones, forming 
a market economy of a very specific type. The outcome can hardly 
be called a more effective economic system, not to mention one 
providing greater fairness as compared to the old one. 
  3) It is impossible to achieve either macroeconomic 
stabilization or correct market behavior without creating 
conditions for economic growth, and on top of that on a basis 
completely different from the one that existed in the planned 
economy. 
  The success of the stabilization program in Japan in 
1949--one of the most outstanding successes of standard 
macroeconomic policy in modern history--was predetermined by the 
restructuring of production, as well as of demand and supply, 
that had taken place during the years preceding the 
stabilization program--from 1946 to 1949. All this had been 
taking place in an environment of considerable, sometimes even 
galloping, inflation. Also, we should not forget that the Korean 
War, which broke out soon after implementation of this program 
had begun, practically removed the overheating of the economy by 
opening up greatly needed opportunities on the side of external 
demand. Moreover, for two more decades after the success of this 
program, state interference at both the macroeconomic and 
microeconomic level remained quite considerable. 
  4) A model intended for small open economies is unsuitable 
for the Russian economy. 
  Until now the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and other 
advisers mainly had to deal with exactly this--small countries, 
including in East Europe. This is their first attempt to help a 
country that is so large, and it is quite natural that a 
different approach is needed here. For instance, the Russian 
economy cannot be based on only one export sector (for instance, 
fuel and power engineering), leaving all other industrial 
sectors to the mercy of fate. And external demand will never be 
able to make up for the collapse of domestic demand; in other 
words, a "Keynesian" type of decline represents a much more 
serious problem here than in a small country. 
  5) We cannot disregard political and geopolitical factors. 
  Russia is part of the former Union. Fourteen republics of 
this former Union have declared their independence, but most of 
them will never be able to achieve real economic independence, 
at least in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, Russia 
cannot remain indifferent to this aspect--if for no other reason 
than because 25 million Russians live in the CIS republics. 
  In addition, Russia itself is a grandiose conglomerate of 
heterogeneous regions, including many that used to consist of 
ethnic minorities [sentence as published]. No economic reform 
can be successful unless it takes this reality into account. 
  The topic of the correct political design for further 
transformations requires time and space exceeding what we are 
allotted for this article. Therefore we will outline only 
briefly what, in our opinion, can be done in order to channel 
the process underway in the right direction; how to give a boost 
to those transformations that promise an effective market 
economy in the future and at the same time erect high defensive 
barriers against those trends that carry the inherent danger of 
leading the economy astray. 
<H5>  2. The Effective Proprietor </H5>
  The main argument of supporters of self-development in 
privatization may be summarized this way: All state property 
must be transferred into private hands as quickly as possible. 
It is unimportant who gets this property initially; all that is 
needed is to enable free trading of newly acquired property 
rights, and in the end more effective proprietors will gain 
possession of this property. 
  Needless to say, there is an enormous distance between this 
theoretical construction and real market conditions, since the 
market is always replete with all sorts of imperfections. 
However, the Russian Government's faith in this liberalistic 
dogma was so great that a whole system of so-called voucher 
privatization was specially constructed to accommodate this 
concept. 
  We have already commented on the results of the 
privatization 
scheme. As to the vouchers, the only thing we could add here is 
that capital asset prices have multiplied tens of times over 
during the past few years even at the level of book value, let 
alone market prices. At the same time, the voucher's market 
price has just reached twice its face value (R20,000). We have 
to remember, however, that the face value of the voucher should 
have been correlated with the total value of capital assets 
measured in the prices of the 1970's-1980's. 
  Thus, the total value of vouchers distributed to the 
population, a considerable part of which still had not been 
invested in anything, currently corresponds to only several 
percent of the total wealth they were supposed to represent. Of 
course, the price of a voucher, like that of any other capital, 
is never determined by its real or perceived share in some 
wealth, since the price of any capital is nothing other than a 
discounted sum of the future income flow expected from this 
capital. 
  Income flow is controlled by directors of post-state 
enterprises, for whom the vouchers are nothing but a headache, 
since they do not help to attract additional capital but require 
that dividends be paid on them. In this sense the entire idea of 
"people's privatization" is false from beginning to end. 
  The concept of privatization in the environment of 
purposeful 
transformation must be completely different. A democratic 
government must for the last time truly act as a proprietor of 
state enterprises and resources. And in this role it must do 
everything possible to transfer this property into reliable (to 
the extent possible) private hands. 
  There were 23,766 enterprises in Russian industry in 1992, 
of 
which 20,757 were the property of the state or of local bodies 
of authority. Many have already been converted into joint-stock 
companies in 1993, but this is actually collective property with 
a great share of stock still in the hands of federal 
authorities. It is not that easy to make the directors of all 
state and post-state enterprises submit to government short- and 
medium-term plans for enterprise reconstruction so that the 
state, having studied these plans, could decide whether to leave 
these directors where they are or replace them. 
  It is not easy, but it has to be done. If the Russian 
Government currently does not have enough resources to carry it 
out, then it may be just the area where technical aid on the 
part of developed countries could be best applied. In the 
process of putting together and studying these plans, the most 
important task is to prepare an outline for the break-up of a 
score of technological monopolies. But even more importantly, 
from the standpoint of the "proprietor--director" problem, it is 
necessary to ensure an atmosphere in which directors are 
answerable to proprietors. First to the reformist government; 
then, as privatization progresses, to the stockholders that will 
come with it. Naturally, directors themselves may become these 
new owners-stockholders, if the government is satisfied with 
their activities in managing the enterprise reconstruction after 
a certain period of time, during which they will be monitored. 
  Keeping in mind the confusion in the privatization 
situation, 
we have attempted to present our proposals in the form of 
consecutive steps (this scheme was proposed by my EPIcenter 
[Center for Economic and Political Research] colleague S.I. 
Ivanenko): 
  1. It is, of course, necessary to fulfill the obligations 
already undertaken--complete the exchange of privatization 
checks for stock. After that, announce no future use of vouchers 
for purposes of further privatization. 
  2. On a mandatory basis, sign contracts with managers of 
state enterprises. The contract should envisage only two points: 
the manager's obligation not to allow the enterprise to go 
bankrupt and the obligation to submit and implement a plan of 
enterprise reconstruction and its preparation for real 
privatization. 
  3. Provide incentives in the form of tax and other 
preferences to transfer the controlling share of stock from 
enterprise employees to large institutional investors. 
  4. Revise the entire legislation, including administrative 
acts, in the direction of establishing the priority of private 
law. Draft and adopt the laws (the Civil and Trade Codes, etc.) 
that are absent and repeal those that are obsolete. Laws should 
be primarily of the direct action kind, with a clear mechanism 
of implementation and concrete sanctions in the event of 
violation. 
  5. Conduct privatization of state property only through 
auctions (the factor mentioned in the past was lack of money; 
now there is money and it is sitting in Western banks). 
  Expand the privatization front: Rights of limited 
availability, which the state grants to commercial companies, 
must be sold, and only at open auctions and only publicly. For 
instance, the rights to lease land in the central part of major 
cities, export licenses, etc. 
  6. Organize a system of antitrust bodies' control over the 
activities of local authorities. It is necessary, through the 
use administrative methods, to protect and develop competition 
in the market of goods, capital, and labor: the allocation of 
facilities and control over wholesale and retail markets; 
increasing the number of stores; the sale of housing and 
allocation of land; squeezing out the mafia; and so on. 
  7. Dramatically cut state procurement in the agro-industrial 
and fuel and power generation sectors (sectors that receive the 
largest subsidies): accelerated denationalization, phased 
reduction of subsidies (time frame should be officially 
announced), organization of a market in agricultural commodities 
futures, and privatization of the main elements of distribution 
systems. 
  8. Set up a system of voluntary reorganization of 
enterprises 
("voluntary bankruptcy") with state support: investment, 
credits, preferences, managerial cadres. 
  To encourage the voluntary bankruptcy of chronically 
insolvent enterprises (50-100 enterprises over three years), 
develop individual packages for voluntary bankrupts, which will 
include clear points of reference: 
  --reorganization of production and management; 
  --assessment of the enterprise's financial and economic 
prospects; 
  --appraisal of the enterprise's (property) market value; 
  --search for investors; 
  --placement of stock in the securities market. 
  Another urgent task in the area of privatization is the 
development of a secondary market of privatized assets. The dual 
system of prices for most capital assets must be liquidated as 
quickly as possible. In those instances when for certain reasons 
it is not desirable to sell capital assets and capital to those 
who offer the highest price (keeping in mind the already 
developed very uneven distribution of financial resources, 
caused to a considerable extent by the ineffectiveness of the 
1992-1993 policy and "mafia-ization"), public auctions should be 
held, with clearly defined and widely publicized decisionmaking 
criteria and mechanisms. 
<H5>  3. Industrial Policy and State Investment </H5>
  The "government of reform" was not only the first 
post-Soviet 
government but also the first government that was knowledgeable 
in economics, at least in theory. To employ a chess analogy, we 
had for the first time a government that knew how to move the 
pieces on a chess board. But in order to win the game it is not 
enough to know how to move the pieces. The chess player must 
have a strategy. At the time the government said that the 
situation was so urgent that at least some kind of game had to 
be started immediately, and then the necessary moves would pop 
up on their own as the situation developed. But even a chess 
genius is unlikely to win a game by merely responding to his 
opponent's moves, without understanding the game design as a 
whole. In this particular case, events themselves handed down 
judgment on the quality of the players. 
  The net result of the reform plan (if there was one at all) 
implemented in Russia in 1992 was a further exacerbation of 
distortions in relative prices and preservation of the 
inefficient structure of industry. The share of sectors 
producing intermediate products in the GDP, already high in the 
Russian economy, has grown even more over the past two years 
since wholesale prices increased most in the primary sectors (in 
the fuel and power generation sector, including due to high 
external demand); followed to a lesser extent by intermediate 
sectors (such as metallurgy, chemical and petrochemical 
production); even less in machine building; and least of all in 
light industry, with the exception of the food processing 
industry where they increased somewhat more. At the same time, 
the rate of retail price increases continuously lagged behind 
that in wholesale prices, and the difference between these two 
indices since 1990 has exceeded 3,000 percent. 
  The post-price liberalization cause-and-effect chain that 
has 
produced this paradoxical situation may be described as follows. 
The persisting sellers market and technological monopolies 
resulted in price rises for primary resources and intermediate 
products. At the stage of final demand the government attempted, 
albeit unsuccessfully, to introduce strict budget restrictions, 
constraining monetary income and cutting back on state 
procurement of armaments. In this area a buyers market began to 
emerge, but only for the final product. This began to exert 
downward pressure on retail prices and wholesale prices in those 
sectors that are positioned closest to the final consumer. The 
latter could not sustain their costs and sharply cut back on the 
level of production. 
  At this stage the government and local bodies of authority 
had to interfere. Especially local bodies of authority, which 
now have the responsibility for subsidizing retail prices, and 
which implemented their own system of subsidies, which lead, 
among other things, to sharp regional price differentiation. For 
instance, in June 1993 a kilogram of bread cost R56 in Nizhniy 
Novgorod, R32 in Samara, and R18.67 in Ulyanovsk. These three 
cities are in the same geographic region and their populations' 
income level is approximately the same. The central government 
had to compensate for the losses of suppliers producing for the 
final consumer. The system of subsidies, which in the past was 
more or less evenly distributed throughout the economy, is 
currently skewed toward production and sales of foodstuffs, 
light industry, and the defense sector. The government also was 
forced to considerably subsidize imports of consumer goods. The 
share of subsidies in the GDP is at the level of about 30 
percent, while preferential credits that went mostly to the 
state-controlled agrarian sector and the fuel and power 
generation complex topped 12 percent of GDP in 1992. This is a 
serious failure of the economic program, which basically was 
envisaged as one founded on a liberalistic approach. 
  Instead of these self-destructive measures, which do not 
lead 
to real structural technological restructuring of relative 
prices, we propose a different approach, the cornerstone of 
which is a carefully thought-through industrial policy. 
  A task of enormous importance is to get rid of technological 
monopolies. However, in most cases this is constrained by the 
fact that giant state (post-state) enterprises, whose labor 
force in some instances numbers in the hundreds of thousands, 
maintain the entire life support system of large cities: 
housing, medical services, child care facilities, recreation 
facilities, and even education are dependent to a considerable 
degree on state enterprises, whose directors frequently behave 
like feudal lords in their fiefdoms. However, by now this system 
already represents an unsustainable burden for post-state 
enterprises. 
  The results of our research in Nizhniy Novgorod have 
revealed 
the following picture. A considerable number of state and 
post-state enterprises directed up to 80 percent of their 
profits to support of social infrastructure. Therefore, the 
first step on the road of structural restructuring, conversion 
in the military-industrial complex, and breaking up monopolies 
should consist of separating social infrastructures from state 
and post-state enterprises. Many things, including breaking up 
industrial giants into several parts, simply cannot be carried 
out without it (see "Nizhniy Novgorod Prologue," Moscow, 1993). 
  The next task of industrial policy is to create a mechanism 
for the redistribution of resources between sectors. This 
mechanism currently practically does not exist. The structure of 
production is rapidly changing in current prices. But profits 
and losses in different sectors of the economy practically do 
not lead to a situation whereby new companies open in some 
sectors and old ones close in others. And the reason is that 
there is no true market in any of the three production factors: 
labor, land, and capital. Therefore redistribution of resources 
will be possible only when these markets are created and 
organized, and also when they have financial resources 
available. The state should play a most active role in carrying 
out this task. 
  The formation of the labor market will be partly achieved 
when social infrastructure, including housing, is separated from 
enterprises. Other steps in this direction should include state 
support for part-time training while continuing work, and 
creating a support system for small and medium-size businesses, 
especially in agriculture, the service sector, etc. 
  A market in land cannot be created with land reform. 
Although 
some progress has been achieved in the area of limiting state 
kolkhozes' monopoly on agricultural land, nevertheless the legal 
situation in this respect remains very confusing, and land 
reform remains an item on the agenda. 
  A market in urban and industrial land also should be 
developing under appropriate political guidance on the part of 
the government. As to fixed assets and other capital goods, the 
privatization scheme described above should create the 
conditions for this market. 
  As soon as these funds find their new owners vested with all 
rights--whether they are the current managers of post-state 
enterprises or someone else--their true capital value based on 
the expected future income flow can be determined. This will 
root out the current dual price system, in which one is 
laughably low, while the other also is in many instances 
inadequate since it includes the elements of a purely 
speculative market. 
  And, finally, the government should play an active role in 
determining priority sectors in industry and forming the future 
industrial structure. The solution to this task must first and 
foremost include laying a foundation for a substantial economic 
growth built on these priorities, which represents in the final 
analysis the main condition for achieving macroeconomic 
stabilization. 
  An approach from the position of vulgar liberalism currently 
leads to hypertrophied growth in the primary sector and a 
gradual washout of the processing industry. We are convinced 
that this trend should be halted. Russia, with its resources and 
human potential, can and should be a modern industrial country. 
But vulgar liberalism will not lead us there even in the most 
distant future. Instead of simply relying on market forces, the 
government should create a serious program for development of 
the processing industry on a new basis, and one of the 
priorities on the part of the government should be in the sphere 
of basic infrastructure--construction of auto and rail roads, 
means of communications, and housing. One may consider this 
utopian given the current crisis in the budget sphere, but we 
will try to show that this not the case. 
  There are currently many plants or, for instance, mines that 
are so obsolete in terms of technology and equipment that it is 
cheaper to close them than modernize them. 
  They are still being artificially kept afloat by direct or 
indirect government subsidies. It would be possible, for 
instance, to use labor resources engaged at such enterprises in, 
for instance, public housing construction, where an incentive 
for workers themselves would be a share in the ownership of the 
newly constructed housing. This can be done without increasing 
the budget deficit. 
  This logic is even more universal. It is true that by 
manipulating the figures the government has been able to reduce 
the federal budget's statistical deficit to 7-8 percent of GDP, 
but the all-inclusive deficit as calculated by the IMF still 
amounts to 20-25 percent, and the difference mainly consists of 
subsidies that do not go through the budget, and preferential 
credits. What is really bad in all this is that the greater part 
of the deficit is used almost fully for consumption and issuance 
of credits to settle current accounts between enterprises. The 
banks use the money in enterprises' accounts for short-term 
lending, earning enormous profits. Thus, the current system of 
combating the budget deficit has practically replaced long-term 
government state investment by short-term credits for current 
operations, to which on top of that the banks in practice add 
their own "tax." If the government returns to long-term 
investment in the development of basic production infrastructure 
and support of modernization of priority sectors in industry, 
while simultaneously reducing the availability of current 
capital (which only serves to perpetuate economic inefficiency), 
it will not increase the correctly calculated budget deficit as 
such, and at the same time at least will provide a ray of hope 
that this deficit will bear some fruit in the future rather than 
leading to ruin. 
  The next important priority should be conversion of the 
military-industrial complex [VPK]. Much has already been said 
about this, but little has been achieved. Freeing state-owned 
VPK enterprises from their social infrastructure is one step; 
another should consist of a state investment program, in this 
instance based on attracting credits. Finally, as to selection 
of other priority sectors in industry, politicians may use the 
following dual criterion used by Japanese politicians in 
1950's-1960's, namely, the sectors selected should have, first, 
the highest potential for labor productivity increase, and 
second, the highest income-related demand elasticity. 
  It is interesting to note that the primary sector is 
excluded 
by both criteria even without any special research. Taking into 
account also a Keynesian-type depression, we can currently add 
another criterion--that of a high multiplicative effect. 
  Of course, an acute need for foreign currency will force the 
government to pay attention to oil production and other resource 
sectors. Nevertheless, the role of these sectors in the 
government's strategic industrial policy (we are not talking 
here about the realities of the current Russian economy as a 
whole) must be limited to simply ensuring sufficient export 
earnings to cover the most acute state needs. If the government 
succeeds in implementing such an industrial strategy, in the 
final analysis it will also be able to achieve a change in a 
real market situation, that is, the processing industry will 
displace the primary sector in its role as Russia's main export 
potential.

<H5>  4. The Banking System, Money, and Savings </H5>
  We have already noted several times that economic growth is 
needed in order to stabilize the national financial system and 
its currency. But there is also a very important reverse 
influence of financial system on growth. It will be impossible 
to achieve growth and structural restructuring, especially in 
the current Russian conditions, unless the policy in the sphere 
of the real economy outlined above is supplemented by adequate 
measures in the financial sphere. 
  We are not talking here about a standard stabilization 
program. It has already failed, and I think it is now clear to 
everybody why. In what follows I want to use the logic presented 
for the first time by Schumpeter in his famous "Theory of 
Economic Development." His concept of economic growth was based 
of the notion of "innovator," one who is capable of utilizing 
some new combination of resources in order to produce more 
efficiently than the current technology of general equilibrium 
permits. In utilizing these new combinations, innovators earn 
profit, which is then offset because scores of emulators emerge, 
but it is offset only to finish its cycle as higher payment for 
"primary production factors," that is, in increased net economic 
wealth. However, in order to utilize these new combinations, 
entrepreneurs need liquid resources in order to initially offer 
"production factors" higher prices and lure them away from less 
efficient producers. 
  The general logic of monetarist theory usually looks at the 
process of money creation and the functioning of the banking 
system at the macroeconomic, that is, aggregated level. For 
Schumpeter, on the other hand, the role of banks consisted 
mainly in their enabling a fast transfer of resources between 
sectors and making liquid resources available to potential 
innovators. In other words, banks do not merely make money. In 
making money, they at the same time accomplish the needed 
redistribution of resources in the economy. This point of view 
is practically completely lost in the current general logic of 
macroeconomic analysis, which still (following Irving Fisher) 
believes that "monetary inflation cannot increase the production 
of farms and factories, cannot speed up the movement of trains 
or vessels. The flow of business depends on natural resources 
and technical conditions, not on the amount of money" (I. 
Fisher. "The Purchasing Capacity of Money," 1912. p 155). There 
is a case, however, where this contention does not stand: When 
"monetary inflation" is accompanied by redistribution of money 
from some users to others, especially in conditions of enormous 
potential, in order to improve economic efficiency. This is 
precisely the situation that is characteristic of the Russian 
economy today. 
  Commercial banks, of which there are currently about 2,000 
in 
Russia, lend money only short-term. One cannot expect anything 
else of them in an economy where the annual inflation rate is 
measured in four-digit figures. Real interest rates rose 
substantially in 1993 but remain negative. At the same time, the 
banking system maintains high profitability, which is achieved 
in the following three ways: 
  --first, many loans are issued for an extremely short 
term--between one and three months--and a considerably higher 
interest rate is applied in this type of lending; 
  --second, interest rates on deposits are naturally lower 
than 
interest rates on loans, while the banking system has a legal 
monopoly of clearing transactions between enterprises. 
Therefore, it is quite enough to simply issue loans with a 
mark-up on the interest rate paid on enterprises' clearing 
accounts (perhaps the widespread intercompany credit--the 
nonpayments problem--may be partially explained by enterprises' 
desire to avoid this de facto taxation by the banks); 
  --third, many major banks effectively combine ruble and 
dollar loans, thus raising the effective interest rate. There 
are known instances where enterprises in need of rubles received 
bank loans in which 50 percent were made up of dollars. For 
instance, during the second half of 1993, when the ruble 
exchange rate to the dollar was stable, and the interest rate on 
loans in rubles stood at 200 percent, this meant that the 
200-percent interest rate was also applied to loans in dollars. 
  All these means serve any goal except the one, the main one, 
that the banking system should serve in the current Russian 
economy. Therefore, the government must absolutely urgently 
create a system of state and private banks that will provide 
long-term financing. Long-term loans currently are provided by 
the Central Bank and are distributed mainly through the group of 
banks that are in fact former government banks commercialized in 
1991, which makes them very political in nature and does not 
guarantee efficient research and monitoring. This system must be 
replaced by a system of state and private long-term financial 
institutions that would operate with government support and 
coordinate their activities with the World Bank, the European 
Bank for Reconstruction, and other international financial 
institutions that wish to help Russia finance its long-term 
economic restructuring. Again, the know-how of the Japanese 
financial system in this respect could be very helpful. Western 
financial aid to long-term development and conversion could be 
channeled through these long-term loan institutions, with the 
compulsory participation of experts from the donor countries in 
the selection of projects and monitoring of their realization. 
  Another task, which is very important if we want to have 
these long-term projects financed in the final analysis not by a 
budget deficit but from private sources, is to increase personal 
savings. The Savings Bank traditionally held and to a 
considerable extent continues to hold a monopoly in the 
accumulation of small personal, "individual" capital. However, 
the interest rate on deposits is low. If we direct the money 
accumulated through the Savings Bank into long-term investment 
loans, it will not be possible to increase these interest rates. 
Social savings deposits, with repayment in kind (for instance, 
in the form of automobiles), were tried during the last years of 
the Soviet Union, but what amounted to a default on the part of 
the state on its obligation sharply decreased confidence in 
them. Nevertheless, perhaps a new government should try to 
introduce them again, this time providing complete state 
guarantees against deception. 
  The experience of Russia itself in the 1920's can perhaps be 
used as a means of stabilizing the currency and stimulation of 
savings. This experience consisted of introducing a new parallel 
currency completely backed up by liquid reserves, precious 
metals, and hard currencies. We have already mentioned that the 
need for a stable monetary unit is very broadly felt in the 
emerging market economy in Russia today. 
  This vacuum is partially filled today by the American dollar 
and German mark, but it would be much more sensible to have a 
national currency that would be stable in international terms 
and fully convertible. The right to issue such currency should 
not be granted to any of the currently existing central banks of 
the former USSR, including the Bank of Russia--it should be 
vested with a specially created bank managed by a group of 
absolutely politically independent professionals. 
  The new money should be introduced into the economy very 
carefully and gradually in order the preserve a fixed exchange 
rate between it and an individual hard currency or basket of 
currencies. Initial means may be drawn from the ruble 
stabilization fund, which is so widely discussed but is doomed 
to remain no more than a phantom in an environment where the 
ruble is used practically without limit to simply cover the 
current state budget deficit and Central Bank credits to provide 
working capital. This new money, because of its stability, will 
gradually but surely displace all soft currencies, probably 
including the current Russian ruble itself, while simultaneously 
easing repatriation of money from abroad. This effect was 
achieved in the 1920's in less than two years. 
<H5>  5. The Russian Federation and the CIS </H5>
  In conclusion we would like to dwell on the problems of the 
Russian Federation and the CIS. The task is to replace the 
chaotic and destructive disintegration of organized 
decentralized authority, supplemented by coordinated regulation 
in the spheres that must be regulated. 
  It is clear that true systemic and structural changes must 
mainly and first and foremost develop from below. But the role 
of political leadership is to organize these changes and give 
them a certain direction. This includes not only economic 
problems but also first and foremost problems of the political 
organization of the state. What is currently happening in this 
sphere by general admission constitutes one of the main 
obstacles to the path of economic reform, although, as our 
economic analysis shows, the importance of this sphere is indeed 
being somewhat exaggerated. 
  The first Soviet reformist regime of President Mikhail 
Gorbachev began a deep-reaching political transformation but had 
to leave the scene because it had never really began true 
economic reform. The new reformist regime of President Boris 
Yeltsin fell victim to another extreme. His government has not 
taken a single step in two years to continue the process of 
political transformation. As a result, the reform process has 
again rolled into a dead end, the attempt to get out of which 
resulted in bloodshed in October 1993. I have already on 
occasion compared the process of transforming postsocialist 
societies with riding a bicycle. The left pedal is political 
reform, the right pedal--economic. If you stop pushing, that is, 
apply the brake to one of the pedals, the bicycle immediately 
overturns. 
  The topic of political reform is on the whole outside the 
scope of this article, but some political initiatives are 
absolutely necessary in order for the transformation process 
described in the preceding subsections to begin to take place. 
  First, a much more effective decision must be made on the 
form of the Federation. This includes not merely separation of 
authority but, more important, the distribution of authority 
between the center and the regions. It is meaningless to resist 
decentralization--it is needed both politically and 
economically. The fact that with respect to many aspects of 
privatization, pricing policy, and social programs power has 
been delegated to local authorities is a step in the right 
direction, but the paradox of the current legal situation is in 
that too many important matters are under "joint jurisdiction." 
In our view, the central government should retain enough 
authority and levers with respect to heterogeneous Russian 
regions to enable it to effectively block chaotic 
disintegration, which in the final count will be dangerous for 
all the regions comprising the Russian Federation--without 
exception. Of course, for a certain time period the south, rich 
in grain, or Siberia, rich in oil, will be able to ignore the 
industrial centers in the Volgo-Vyatka region or the North 
Urals, but disarray in Arzamas-16 or Chelyabinsk-5, situated in 
precisely these regions, may destroy the entire country and a 
considerable part of Europe. 
  The realities of Russian industry and infrastructure are 
such 
that they, much like the Russian military machine, will continue 
to call for a strong coordinating and controlling role of the 
state for many years to come. 
  As to purely economic aspects of the transformation process, 
our opinion is that coordination must be carried on not only in 
Russia but in the entire CIS. The economies of all the newly 
independent states are still so much intertwined that, 
especially bearing in mind industry's low capacity for charge, 
it is much cheaper to gradually phase out the existing system of 
division of labor than to destroy it overnight. This simple 
truth is currently gaining understanding all over the territory 
of the former Soviet Union. 
  Border control between former Soviet republics is 
practically 
nonexistent, and therefore it is important not to get carried 
away by attempts to set up customs controls at borders but 
instead to set up a Customs Union, using the borders of the 
former Soviet Union that are well-equipped for that purpose. 
  Economic ties between enterprises situated in different 
newly 
independent states should not be subjected to any regulation or 
restrictions; the same goes for movement of goods, labor, and 
capital. A common currency area is in the interests of all the 
republics, including Russia. How to form this area, however, is 
a delicate problem. The economic potential of the Russian 
Federation is so overwhelmingly great that it will still de 
facto play a leading role in any multilateral agreement, but if 
other newly independent states begin to suspect foul play or 
encounter direct diktat on the part of the Russian Government, 
as occurred in some recent proposals regarding the ruble zone, 
the problems of the common currency will be sharply politicized 
and will become practically unresolvable. 
  In addition, it is completely unclear, no matter from which 
angle we look at it, why it is that the Russian Government and 
its Central Bank--which allowed inflation to reach 2,600 percent 
the year before last and 1,000 percent last year--should be 
entrusted with the task of maintaining the value of the common 
currency. 
  In this respect our proposals for the introduction of a new 
convertible currency controlled by an Independent Reserve Bank 
and a Banking Union, for instance, may offer one way to avoid 
these difficulties. A special bank for mutual clearing between 
CIS countries also may be set up on the basis of Western credits 
convertible into this new currency. Simplifying clearing 
procedures between CIS countries could become an important step 
on the path to economic revival. 
  In 1991 we proposed and prepared the Economic Union Treaty, 
which was signed in October by the heads of 10 republics-newly 
independent states. At the beginning of December 1991 the 
leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus met in Minsk and decided 
to take another road. They were so overcome by enthusiasm on the 
subject of the new agreement they had just happened to think of 
that they even without hesitation renounced their signatures on 
the previous agreement. Actually, this was only one of this kind 
of action in a chain of endless reneging on previous promises 
and political statements. Unfortunately, all this did not start 
then and did not end there. 
  The very course of history over the past two years has 
proven 
that we were right to insist on an economic union. Now those 
same politicians are beginning to speak differently. It is 
becoming obvious even to them that it is impossible to implement 
an effective reform policy in countries without borders and 
customs, without a currency and financial system, without law 
and order, with ties disrupted both internally and between 
sectors; on top of this now dozens of self-proclaimed regional 
sovereignties, presidents of small regions, and ethnic and civil 
conflicts in many parts of what was recently one country and 
remains to a considerable extent a whole entity as a territory 
of habitation. 
  An economic treaty between the republics of the former USSR 
was signed in September 1993 for the second time, two years 
later. It is clear that without it, reforms cannot succeed. Will 
the current politicians want it to work? I do not know; I am not 
sure. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  Both we and our opponents of substance support 
liberalization. But there are two different kinds of 
liberalization. Vulgar liberalization has set free 
supermonopolistic monsters and let go of traditions, relations, 
systems, and the ties of the command economy. What we want is 
for society to be free of such an economy. 
  How the history of our country will look in the 21st century 
depends to a great extent on whether we give a free hand to the 
mafiosi monster of the totalitarian economy or whether we are 
able to overpower it this time. This is the angle from which we 
view the processes currently underway and the criterion by which 
we measure our political decisions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar by Oleg Bondarenko at the </F>
Institute of Economic Problems of the Transitional Period, under 
"Reform" rubric; date not given: "The Three Faces of Gaydar: 
the Economist, the Politician, and the Entrepreneur" -- first 
paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] I met with Yegor Gaydar at the Institute of the 
Economic Problems of the Transitional Period, which he headed 
prior to his return to the government. Now he has returned to 
the director's chair. 
  [Bondarenko] Did you not quit the institute during your time 
in the government? 
  [Gaydar] No, I left these walls temporarily, although I 
maintained many links with the institute. 
  [Bondarenko] Clearly it is dear to you personally. 
  [Gaydar] Of course, because the institute represents a 
community of skilled specialists. Many of them think as I do. 
On the whole this is a viable scientific collective. 
  [Bondarenko] Would you say that this is your scientific 
school? 
  [Gaydar] I would not put it that way. It is more a question 
of a group of economists who came with me to carry out reforms. 
  [Bondarenko] As I understand it, whatever the situation, you 
intend to use the institute to advance the reforms which have 
begun? 
  [Gaydar] In any event we shall try to do everything in our 
power to give a precise analysis of what is going on, to express 
our views on what is being done right and what is being done 
wrongly, and to submit our own proposals. 
  [Bondarenko] On the matter of analyses, incidentally, what 
is your assessment of the country's socioeconomic situation at 
the present time? 
  [Gaydar] It is characterized by a considerable instability. 
The most serious problem, in my view, is the lack of 
determination on the part of the organs of power to continue to 
implement the economic course adopted. We have already seen how 
in the period between 1989 and 1991 an ominous situation 
developed in which the old system of economic management had 
already outlived itself but the union authorities could not make 
up their minds to embark on a new one. Consequently the most 
urgent question today remains that of stepping up the dynamic 
transformations so as to more quickly organize the kind of 
integrated life-support system for the country which would be 
based on market relationships, private ownership, and civil law. 
  In my view, things began to go wrong at the start of 1993, 
when the rate at which outmoded economic structures were being 
dismantled slowed considerably. That is why the former sources 
of financial receipts rapidly ran dry, while the proper 
preconditions for new sources were simply not created. 
  [Bondarenko] How long can this uncertainty go on? 
  [Gaydar] World experience suggests, unfortunately, that 
there is certainly no definite time limit. For example, there 
is a whole series of states which, like Russia, have moved away 
from socialist methods of economic management but have not been 
able to find within themselves the strength to carry the reforms 
they have begun through to their logical conclusion. Although, 
it is true, some countries can already boast of successes. 
  [Bondarenko] In your opinion, which countries have been 
successful? 
  [Gaydar] Well, first of all I would name Poland. You will 
recall how back in the late eighties it had far more appalling 
indicators of declining output volume than, for instance, 
Romania, which was not very prosperous at that time either. But 
whereas Bucharest is still unable to cope with such a decline, 
Warsaw has managed to improve the situation for three years now 
and has recently achieved tangible and stable growth of the 
national economy. 
  [Bondarenko] Nevertheless, in Poland they also change the 
composition of the government quite often, the country is 
periodically shaken by strikes, and there are demonstrations of 
discontent. 
  [Gaydar] All of this merely demonstrates one thing: The 
process of the transition to the market is bound to have 
problems by virtue of its complexity and extraordinary nature. 
Thus even when its implementation is generally successful, a 
temporary socioeconomic tension is always bound to occur. In 
addition to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary have also 
been coping with the reforms quite well. 
  [Bondarenko] How, then, do you explain the undoubted 
economic successes of such recently poor countries as China and 
Vietnam, even though the regimes there are still authoritarian 
and they still have party general secretaries as leaders? 
  [Gaydar] It is simply that in those countries we see an 
example of economies which are only just becoming 
industrialized. In that sense the states you mention are 
comparable more with the Russia of the NEP period and the 
subsequent industrialization. In China and Vietnam a large part 
of the population is still employed in the agrarian sector. 
Thus the potential for the redistribution of labor resources to 
industry is still huge there. So comparing their situation with 
the present situation in Russia is unacceptable, in my view. 
Especially since the level of poverty in those countries and in 
ours still does not favor them. 
  The question here is more one of whether it is possible in 
industrialized postsocialist countries to make the transition 
from the plan to the civilized market gently and painlessly. At 
the present time we have approximately 23 states, including the 
former republics of the USSR, which made the transition between 
systems between 1989 and 1994. Their experience suggests that 
the attempts to implement the reform slowly and in small steps, 
with one eye on the past, without counting the cost, and 
retaining state monopoly of the management of the economy 
entails the most catastrophic failures. The closest example of 
that is provided by Ukraine, with its policy of rock-bottom 
prices. Nevertheless, that is effectively what the leaders of 
Civic Union, the communists, and the agrarian-industrial 
factions in parliament are urging us to do. 
  For my own part I drew the conclusion long ago that 
indecision during the transition to fundamentally different 
forms of economic management is the worst sin. 
  [Bondarenko] Are there significant differences between 
Zhirinovskiy's econonmic program and what is offered by, say, 
the communists and agrarians? 
  [Gaydar] Zhirinovskiy has no economic program at all. How 
can you describe a great mass of empty promises as an economic 
program? 
  [Bondarenko] Yegor Timurovich, is there anything for you to 
criticize yourself for during your tenure as head of the 
government? 
  [Gaydar] That is inevitable. First, for not doing enough to 
explain our work. Furthermore, we did not do enough to create a 
theoretical base to ensure the irreversibility of the reforms. 
  [Bondarenko] I can somehow understand the rejection of your 
program by the venerable academics whom Konstantin Borovoy 
called, aptly I think, the pensioners of perestroyka. However, 
how do you explain the fact that you were and still are sharply 
criticized by those who would seem to be your potential 
supporters, people of undoubted democratic convictions and, 
furthermore, your coevals. I have in mind Grigoriy Yavlinskiy 
and Larisa Piyasheva. Would it not be better to win them over 
to your side and include them in the government rather than 
simply leaving them among your opponents? Because, it seems to 
me, many people are confused and cannot make up their minds 
which of you they ought to trust. 
  [Gaydar] I would gladly take Grigoriy Alekseyevich into my 
team, but I fear he would not accept. 
  [Bondarenko] Did you sit down with them at the same table, 
counter their objections, and come to some kind of consensus? 
  [Gaydar] I have spoken with Yavlinskiy many times. And I 
was convinced that we do not have as many substantial 
differences of opinion as we may seem to have to outsiders. The 
only problem is that our views do not coincide on certain 
practical steps in the implementation of the reforms. 
  [Bondarenko] What about Larisa Ivanovna? 
  [Gaydar] To be honest I have not had the occasion to meet 
with her. I do know, however, that Anatoliy Chubays has had a 
thorough discussion with her on the problems of privatization. 
As is well known, Piyasheva was the initiator of the so-called 
wholesale privatization carried out in Moscow. As a result the 
majority of the capital's stores passed virtually for nothing 
into the hands of the sales staff alone, which had dire 
consequences for the efficiency of the trade sector. 
  [Bondarenko] You will remember that when you were premier 
many business people explained their exclusively commercial 
activities by saying that excessive taxation simply does not 
allow them to invest resources in production. 
  [Gaydar] On the whole I agree with such assertions. Taxes 
in our country are indeed high. Thus their gradual reduction 
is, generally speaking, our state's strategic task. 
  [Bondarenko] But was it impossible to act differently 
before? 
  [Gaydar] Bear in mind that taxes are set in such a way as to 
cover state expenditure. At present state expenditure is so 
high that it does not allow enterprise to develop normally in 
this country. We in the government sought to create the 
preconditions for the gradual lowering of expenditure, to which 
end it was proposed to reduce appropriations for defense, cut 
subsidies on imports and in the national economy in general, and 
abandon preferential credit issue and everything else which has 
an adverse effect on the level of taxation. But strange as it 
may seem, it was for steps such as those that we were criticized 
most. 
  [Bondarenko] After the collapse of the USSR, the great many 
union departments, ministries, and party committees at various 
levels were scrapped, of course. As a result, in Moscow alone a 
mass of official buildings were due to be vacated. But what has 
happened in practice is that there is a chronic shortage of 
them. Does this mean that the administrative apparatus has not 
only not been reduced since then, which could logically have 
been expected, but on the contrary has grown even larger? 
  [Gaydar] I must object straight away that a considerable 
part of the premises are actually not now occupied by 
administrative organs but are leased by commercial structures. 
As for the former union sectoral ministries, they have 
virtually all been transformed into concerns without changing 
addresses. Nevertheless, I do not deny that the old managers 
were able to adapt very quickly to the present economic 
conditions. Both because of the inconsistency of the reforms 
and the fact that the most important levers of individual 
control held by functionaries were not dismantled, with the 
latter managing to a considerable extent to seize real power at 
a new level. You have deprived us of the opportunity of 
allocating funds and setting limits, they say, so we will 
distribute quotas and preferential credits just as successfully. 
  [Bondarenko] Your opponents claim that relative financial 
stabilization has largely been secured by artificial means. 
They cite the chronic holdups with wage payments, the state's 
tremendous internal debts, irritating problems with mutual 
nonpayments, and much else besides. They even predict that one 
fine day it may all burst like a soap bubble and total collapse 
will, they say, hit the economy. 
  [Gaydar] I agree with one point you made. The excessive 
financial promises made a year ago have caused a very severe 
financial crisis which is still having a very painful effect on 
the Russian economy. Because nonpayments and underfunding of 
state spending have regrettably become a regular phenomenon. 
Hence the endless complaints from all quarters. 
  Thus, the gap between financial commitments and real 
potential has proved an extremely unpleasant fact of life, the 
result of ill-conceived government decisions. This must of 
course be taken into consideration and our work must be geared 
to this. Nevertheless, amid these unfavorable conditions we have 
nonetheless been able to drive the rate of inflation down from 
26 percent last August to 21 percent in September, 16 percent in 
November, and end the year on 13 percent. We brought about the 
marked improvement in the picture not by reducing current state 
funding but by cutting back excessive state commitments. 
  [Bondarenko] Do you not think that the dictatorship of the 
proletariat which the Bolsheviks discussed at such length is 
today manifesting itself more perceptibly than ever? You only 
have to compare the wages of a professor at a higher educational 
establishment and a miner. 
  [Gaydar] As for miners' wages they are by and large not as 
high as they were in the former Soviet Union, say. At the same 
time there are many industrial sectors where the pay is 
extremely miserly. However, I do agree with you on another 
point. The income of representatives of fundamental science, 
culture, and education has of course suffered the most. This 
abnormal situation has arisen in my view because the above 
spheres of intellectual labor had the least protection in the 
face of the powerful lobbying done by various sectors of the 
economy. People must clearly realize that every extra ruble 
they get for themselves ultimately means one ruble less to fund 
the social sphere. 
  [Bondarenko] It is no secret that the government did not pay 
peasants on time for last year's harvest. It is only now that 
the agrarian sector is being allocated a sum running into 
trillions. Fears are being voiced that this money will once 
again go down the drain. Yet at the same time, something must 
be done about the debts. What do you see as the best solution? 
  [Gaydar] This question must be divided into two parts. The 
ordered grain must of course be paid for. But at the same time 
we must also see the root of the current nonpayments crisis. I 
repeat, the government has taken on a financial burden that is 
totally beyond its capabilities. In 1993 decisions were 
promulgated regarding the retention of the state order for food, 
major federal investment programs, and high -- and, what is 
more, indexed -- purchase prices for the harvest, whereby the 
government drove itself into a corner. 
  [Bondarenko] Shouldn't the unfavorable consequences of these 
measures have been foreseen straightaway? 
  [Gaydar] They were quite obvious even then. A very serious 
mistake was made, let me tell you. 
  [Bondarenko] But why? 
  [Gaydar] Because there is a tremendous temptation not to 
take money seriously. Especially if you can avoid paying today 
and leave it until a few months later. Because current funds 
and what are still only proposed funds are quite different 
things: You are very conscious of the former, but the latter 
are just a hope of better things to come. Especially when you 
are coming under pressure from all sides, beset by demands or 
even threats. Take the agrarians. They simply implored us: 
Just make us a promise and it will all work out all right. 
Nevertheless everything ultimately has to be paid for and, 
regrettably, at a very high price. 
  What do I see as a reasonable solution? Once you make 
promises, you must carry them out like it or not. But you must 
think twice before venturing to make any promises. And 
agriculture is by no means the exception here. 
  [Bondarenko] In the light of what we have said, how do you 
see the country's economy developing by the end of the year? 
  [Gaydar] Two scenarios are likely. One presupposes that the 
government will nonetheless be able to keep some control of the 
situation and not take the stupid actions that it is vigorously 
being pressed to take. Let us hope the authorities will not 
fling credit around all over the place. Although even in that 
situation the Cabinet of Ministers will be forced to work under 
serious pressure. Because in my view inflation will remain 
fairly high until the end of the year, fluctuating between 15-20 
percent a month. In any case, I do not see any real chance of 
an appreciable fall in this indicator. This means that we 
should not expect major private capital investment, nor will the 
preconditions for economic growth emerge. But at the same time 
this does not mean inevitable collapse. 
  The second scenario is far less favorable. If the government 
succumbs to the lobbyists' demands, it will have to considerably 
increase the growth of the money supply. And, faced with the 
subsequent rapid price rise, the authorities will end up having 
to introduce a fixed ruble rate of exchange and establish tough 
price controls. As a result we will once again be faced with 
commodity shortages, loss of ruble convertibility, and, 
ultimately, the end of the reforms. 
  [Bondarenko] In your view, what should the center's regional 
policy be? 
  [Gaydar] It should of course be based on the principles of 
normal federalism, which presuppose the clear-cut distribution 
of sources of income for the federal and local budgets. The 
republics, krays, and oblasts must be able to use their own 
financial resources independently. They must be given extensive 
powers in the field of economic activity on the territory under 
their jurisdiction. Nevertheless, federal bodies must 
effectively monitor the unity of the Russia-wide market and 
regulate foreign economic ties. 
  [Bondarenko] We are coming up to new elections to local 
bodies of power. Not-unfounded fears are being voiced that the 
communists and similar forces may quite easily take their 
revenge during these elections. And once they have consolidated 
their position at the helm in the regions, they would wage a 
more decisive offensive on the center. I would like to know 
what you think about this. 
  [Gaydar] The situation is indeed a difficult one. That is 
why we have tried to create more organized and competent 
managerial organs in the regions that would not subsequently 
repeat the vexing mistakes of the past. I believe the results 
of the coming elections will be like the previous ones, 
extremely differentiated. We do know, after all, that the 
December elections to the Moscow Duma brought success for the 
democrats. I am hoping for a similar result in other major 
centers. Nevertheless it is too early to predict the outcome of 
the campaign in many regions. 
  [Bondarenko] I realize that both the "Russia's Choice" 
movement you lead and the president need one another's support. 
Nevertheless, a perceptible distance between them has been felt 
just recently. Is that due to tactical considerations, or is 
the problem more serious? 
  [Gaydar] I must state unequivocally that we still support 
Boris Nikolayevich and he us. The fact that, as head of state 
elected by the whole people, B.N. Yeltsin must consider various 
factors and cooperate with a broad spectrum of political forces, 
is another matter. It is no secret, however, that we by no 
means always agree with the decisions taken within the 
president's entourage. 
  [Bondarenko] Can "Russia's Choice," in view of the size of 
its deputy faction, use the State Duma not only as a platform to 
propagandize its ideas but also to put them into effect? 
  [Gaydar] I admit this is difficult. We do not after all 
have a parliamentary majority, but nonetheless we are not 
abandoning our attempts to achieve our aims. For instance, we 
have just been able to make substantial amendments to the new 
Criminal Code. There are also other draft legislative acts that 
we intend to promote with the support of other factions. 
  [Bondarenko] How strict is internal discipline within your 
faction? Are deserters threatened with exclusion from the list 
of deputies? 
  [Gaydar] We give our deputies fairly broad autonomy. We 
even agreed to two of them switching to other factions, although 
that was indeed only their own wish. I am very surprised by the 
press speculation regarding the alleged crisis or even split in 
our bloc. On the contrary, "Russia's Choice" now seems to me to 
be the most disciplined faction -- and the most solid faction in 
light of the results of voting in the Duma, since the other 
democratic factions cannot compete with it. Nevertheless I do 
not rule out the idea that in time one or two people may break 
away from us. However, the express desire of representatives of 
other parties and independent deputies to cooperate with 
"Russia's Choice" easily makes up for these losses. 
  [Bondarenko] How did parliamentarians react to your 
intention of creating a party of the same name on the basis of 
the election campaign movement? 
  [Gaydar] You know, to my amazement this idea met with 
extremely broad support from democratic factions. Even those 
colleagues who were previously seen to waver are vigorously 
joining in the work of organizing the new political party, whose 
task is to act as a stable base for implementing socioeconomic 
transformations. 
  [Bondarenko] Which factions do you rank among your closest 
allies in the Duma? 
  [Gaydar] Based on the results of the voting, the "12 
December" deputy group is very close to us. They are followed 
by the Party of Russian Union and Accord and the 
"Boldyrev-Yavlinskiy-Lukin" faction. 
  [Bondarenko] How likely is the possibility of a broad union 
of democratic forces in the near future? 
  [Gaydar] We have always been and will remain in favor of 
that. So, it is up to the other members of the democratic 
movement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Illarionov, former adviser to the </F>
prime minister of the Russian Federation, by Dmitriy Travin; 
place and date not given: "Andrey Illarionov: No One Asked for 
My Assent. The Adviser to the Prime Minister on His Former Boss"] 
  [Text] On the heels of the resignations of Gaydar and 
Fedorov followed the resignation of Andrey Illarionov, head of 
the analysis and planning group under the prime minister. The 
resignation was completely logical, since it was precisely 
Illarionov, side by side with Gaydar and Fedorov, who was a most 
active proponent of an intensified toughness in credit and 
financial policy. Our conversation took place on the day after 
the announcement of the resignation. 
  [Travin] Today you are taking your leave of Chernomyrdin 
with 
a fair amount of fanfare. But when your collaboration was 
beginning, you evaluated the prime minister's possibilities as a 
reformer, evidently, fairly optimistically? At that time, the 
union of Chernomyrdin and Illarionov surprised many people. 
  [Illarionov] To be precise, I must note that I did not come 
to Chernomyrdin. I was simply appointed to the post of head of 
the analysis and planning group. 
  The proposal that I fill the post in question came to me at 
the end of January of last year. I said that I needed to think 
about it. The mulling lasted for three months. Chernomyrdin 
during that time did not express any great desire to appoint me 
to the post, and I did not strive toward it, particularly. 
  More than that, if in January our meetings were fairly 
regular, in the spring I was not able see him for more than two 
months on a very important matter. At that time, the government 
apparatus was engaged in the quiet suffocation of the working 
center of economic reforms (an organ created by Gaydar at the 
dawn of the reform--D.T.). I wanted to discuss this problem and 
to stop the destruction, but Chernomyrdin evaded a meeting with 
me. 
  There were days when I spent almost 24 hours in the prime 
minister's waiting room, but my efforts were spent without 
success. It became clear that Chernomyrdin was well apprised of 
the problems of the working center, and that everything was 
taking place with his knowledge. I ceased any attempts at 
establishing contact. 
  Suddenly, on 26 April, several hours after the results of 
the 
April referendum became known, the telephone rang, and I was 
invited to a meeting with the prime minister. Everyone remembers 
the results of the referendum today, just as they remember that 
on the eve of the voting many people evaluated Yeltsin's chances 
for victory extremely skeptically. 
  I spent three hours with Chernomyrdin at that time. An 
unprecedented fact. After all, the prime minister, and 
especially at such a moment, had an enormous number of important 
matters to attend to. It suddenly transpired that the order 
naming me to the post of head of the analysis and planning group 
had long been ready. And now no one was asking for my assent. 
  [Travin] But you, apparently, perceived Chernomyrdin's 
actions as a sudden change in his consciousness, brought about 
under the influence of the referendum. The possibilities of 
cooperation in such a political situation were evaluated more 
optimistically than during the time you were trying to get 
through on the subject of the working center. 
  [Illarionov] It was not a change in consciousness, but 
precisely a change in the political game. It was necessary to 
demonstrate to the public some change in the composition of the 
government. My optimism applied not to April but rather to 
January, when it seemed that Chernomyrdin grasped reformist 
ideas. At that time, after all, he gave voice to several very 
strong speeches, in Davos, for example. It seemed to me that the 
prime minister was not simply repeating my words, but perceived 
what was said as his very own. 
  In April I no longer thought this, but I still believed that 
I could bring some benefit if I were in the post in question. 
Our relations remained more or less acceptable until July, that 
is, until the moment that Mr. Gerashchenko conducted his money 
reform. The prime minister supported this reform. 
  [Travin] Soon after this, you made a series of sharp 
statements, coming out in print against the reform. Obviously, 
there was some kind of confrontation with Chernomyrdin? 
  [Illarionov] We had two conversations on this topic. The 
most 
serious was on 29 July. We talked for about an hour with raised 
voices and could not find common ground for a long time. 
Finally, I said that I had to go to a press conference that had 
been arranged earlier. The prime minister got scared and said 
that he forbade me to give it. 
  I have to say that it was originally planned to hold the 
press conference on Ilinka. But the government press center 
issued a statement--three times, in fact--to the effect that it 
would not take place. I announced to its management that I would 
speak with journalists in any case, even if I had to do so in 
the street; plus I would tell them about the prohibition laid on 
the meeting with the press. In the end I managed, bypassing the 
press center, to come to an agreement on the conduct of a press 
conference on Zubovskiy Boulevard. It was to that place that I 
planned to go from Chernomyrdin's office. 
  When the prime minister tried to forbid me to meet with the 
press, I said that it was impossible to call it off and that the 
best egress from the situation that had taken shape would be the 
personal appearance of Chernomyrdin at Zubovskiy Boulevard. And 
I added that he should make a statement on the erroneousness and 
criminality of the money reform and that Gerashchenko had led 
the government astray. To that the prime minister responded that 
he was not about to do that but that still, now he had begun to 
understand the situation better. He also expressed regret that 
our conversation had not taken place earlier. 
  [Travin] But after all, the conversation could not have 
taken 
place earlier, since the whole government was not informed in 
advance about the conduct of the money reform in such a variant. 
  [Illarionov] Of course. That was the reason that I still 
insisted that I would hold the press conference. To this I 
received the response: Illarionov, do not forget yourself.... 
  [Travin] He came out and said that? 
  [Illarionov] No, in fact he said it much more sharply, but I 
am not going to repeat his expression now. Then the prime 
minister gave me to understand that no one in particular was 
keeping me in the government. To which I, likewise, frankly gave 
him to understand that I was not hanging onto the job but that I 
was obligated to speak my mind directly, both to the prime 
minister, since I was his adviser, and to the journalists. 
  The upshot was that we agreed that I would refrain after all 
from any statements to the press; however, the prime minister 
had to convince the president of the fallaciousness of the 
conducted money reform and (since repealing it was already 
impossible) of the necessity of immediately firing Gerashchenko. 
The agreement was strictly a gentlemen's one. I fulfilled it 
completely, saying not a word at the press conference about the 
money reform. Chernomyrdin did not keep his promise. 
  [Travin] Did the prime minister never realize the 
harmfulness 
of the money reform, or was the patronage of the Central Bank's 
policy a conscious political play on his part? 
  [Illarionov] The main goal of the activity both of 
Chernomyrdin and of Gerashchenko consists by no means in the 
reformation of the economy, but in the attainment of a maximum 
of power, both on the territory of Russia and also beyond its 
borders: within the framework of the entire former Soviet Union. 
Money reform in the form in which it was conducted answered only 
one goal--the restoration of the USSR, at least in questions of 
the conduct of credit and monetary policy. 
  [Travin] Immediately after the exchange of banknotes, 
representatives of the republics of the CIS came running to 
Moscow.... 
  [Illarionov] And they ran to see not the president, or even 
the prime minister, but precisely Gerashchenko--the person 
distributing the money. And the policy of gathering all the 
republics under the Russian roof almost succeeded. The agreement 
on the ruble zone of a new type was prepared on an emergency 
basis and quickly signed. 
  [Travin] How in the world, after that episode, did relations 
with Chernomyrdin evolve? 
  [Illarionov] They hardly evolved at all. As a result of our 
conversation, I ended up in the hospital, where I spent more 
than a month. After that, I convalesced in a sanatorium, 
although not very successfully. Then I went to work, but for the 
last half-year Chernomyrdin has not once shown a desire to speak 
with the head of his analysis and planning group or to give him 
any kind of assignment. 
  He and I met only three times, at my initiative, and these 
meetings worked out because they were held at times of 
emergency: on the night of 21-22 September, on the night of 3-4 
October, and on the morning of 13 December. 
  [Travin] Were these meetings marked by anything in 
particular? 
  [Illarionov] Each of them was memorable in its own way, but 
what brings them all together is the figure of the main hero of 
our conversations. Each time, we talked about Mr. Gerashchenko. 
In particular, on 13 December I spoke out about my understanding 
of the election results. In my view, a most important reason for 
such results was inflation. People voted not so much for 
Zhirinovskiy as against the government. It is interesting that 
Chernomyrdin, generally speaking, again promised me to resolve 
the issue of Gerashchenko. He asked me to provide him with 
materials substantiating the necessity for firing the chairman 
of the Central Bank, and he did receive these materials. In two 
weeks, the prime minister declared that he did not know a 
greater reformer than Mr. Gerashchenko and that there were no 
problems in working with him. 
  [Travin] Much is being said today to the effect that 
Chernomyrdin aspires to the presidency. How do you assess his 
chances? 
  [Illarionov] They are very high. At least, among the 
candidates there are at the given moment. There is no question 
that Chernomyrdin is a talented politician. He knows how to 
avoid conflict and criticism aimed in his direction. After all, 
even after having spent more than a year in the prime minister's 
seat, he was able to represent the situation in such a way that 
all the fire of criticism for the economic problems was directed 
at Gaydar and Fedorov. Besides, he has been able more than 
anyone else to gain the favor of the president. 
  [Travin] How did he manage to get so far into his good 
graces? 
  [Illarionov] I think that personal qualities were at work 
here, and also the fact that the president and the prime 
minister are people of the same generation. Gaydar and Fedorov 
have neither the same life experience behind them as does 
Chernomyrdin, nor a period of administrating the largest gas 
corporation in the country, with a billion-dollar turnover. 
  Chernomyrdin is a person who stands firmly on his feet. 
Suffice it to recall how he appeared in the government in May 
1992, and immediately in the post of deputy prime minister, and 
not minister of fuel and energy. There is much that is 
mysterious in the story of the firing of Lopukhin (the former 
minister of fuel and energy) and the appointment of Chernomyrdin. 
  [Travin] In order to become president, Chernomyrdin will 
have 
to go through the procedure of national elections, and that is a 
different story than apparat games. 
  [Illarionov] That is exactly what will be the simplest 
thing. 
In the first place, the prime minister has already accomplished 
a great many trips around the regions, and he has met with a 
mass of people. Everywhere, he has made good contacts, since he 
has said, "Yes," and not "No." 
  In the second place, the balance of forces will be 
approximately the following. On the democratic 
flank--Yavlinskiy, possibly Shakhray, possibly Gaydar. In the 
center--Chernomyrdin. On the right--Zhirinovskiy. Only 
Zhirinovskiy and Chernomyrdin will emerge in the second round. 
After that, all clear-thinking people will start to call to vote 
for Chernomyrdin, and since, I am convinced, most Russians are 
sober-minded people, he is exactly who will become president. 
  [Travin] Could all of that happen earlier than in two years? 
  [Illarionov] It could, If, in a year and a half, the country 
finds itself in a condition of hyperinflation, the question will 
arise as to who is responsible for this. Since the prime 
minister has already repeatedly proven his amazing capacity for 
evading direct responsibility, then probably a multitude of 
people will appear who will do everything possible so that the 
responsibility lies with the president. 
  [Travin] What awaits the country under President 
Chernomyrdin? 
  [Illarionov] Policy will be about the same as it has been 
lately under Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. We will have a highly 
monopolized economy with an enormous share of expensive 
governmental regulation. And the basis for the monopolies will 
be the old ministerial structures. 
  It is fairly clear what will be in the political sphere. If 
under President Yeltsin human rights are basically observed, 
judging from the customs that reign in Chernomyrdin's team, the 
situation could change in a radical way. Take if only the recent 
accusation of Fedorov that after his resignation announcement, 
he supposedly went to the U.S. Embassy and asked for a 
profitable job overseas. Chernomyrdin also committed a rudeness 
to Gaydar soon after the latter returned to the government. He 
declared that the first deputy prime minister would do as he was 
directed. In Italy, in a moment of candor, it was said that in 
Moscow Chernomyrdin was in command. That says a lot. [end 
Illarionov] 
  When our conversation with the former head of the 
analysis and planning group was over, an INTERFAX tape was 
brought in, which contained the well-known report by the 
government press service to the effect that Andrey Illarionov 
had been fired for absenteeism. This was the interpretation of 
his recent business trip to London, attempting to show that it 
was not a matter of ideological differences and not of voluntary 
resignation, but of an ordinary violation of work discipline, 
which somehow happened at a moment very convenient for the prime 
minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergei Dubinin, Russia's acting finance </F>
minister, by Vladimir Gurevich, MOSCOW NEWS deputy 
editor-in-chief: "Russian Economy at a Turning Point"; first 
paragraph is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] "I do not agree that everything has been lost, that 
we are in free-fall. But I fully agree that we are at a decisive 
stage, while finances and the economy have found themselves in a 
sense on the top of a mountain," said Russia's Acting Finance 
Minister Sergei Dubinin in an interview with Vladimir Gurevich, 
MOSCOW NEWS Deputy Editor-in-Chief. 
  If we are atop a mountain pass we can only go down in 
any case. 
  The question is what will go down, whether we will secure a 
reduction of inflation or roll down the mountain side ourselves. 
  Expectations of a mounting inflation and then of a 
financial collapse resulting from the actions of the present 
government are quite widespread today. 
  These may be deceptive expectations. In any case no steps 
towards a catastrophe have been taken so far. As for inflation 
in the near future, it will certainly go down to about 
15% in 
February compared to 21-22% in January. 
  But everybody is talking about major injections of 
money on account of the last years' government debts. 
  Everybody also says that debts should be repaid and begin to 
count how much the treasury owes them. Meanwhile all obligations 
for expenditure under the budget drawn up last summer and 
submitted to the then Supreme Soviet were fulfilled by the 
government. There would have been no debts if expenditures had 
not been indexed in the fourth quarter. Besides that some people 
are fond of counting debts only one way. The agrarians, for 
instance, borrowed heavily in 1992 but returned very little in 
1993, and there was no big fuss, although the sums were very 
large. 
  The government is now repaying some of its debts. A decision 
has been made to pay in the first quarter 3.8 trillion rubles on 
account of contracts concluded last year. This is a 
comparatively safe level with respect to inflation. We will not 
induce the collapse of the financial system. It should also be 
pointed out that the entire situation is a stern warning to the 
government itself when it undertakes further obligations. 
  There is a case in point now that the discussion of 
this year's draft budget is under way. 
  The draft was drawn up with great difficulty but has been 
made sufficiently strict, as it should be. The planned budgetary 
deficit of 54 trillion rubles, plus the repayment of about 60 
trillion rubles of 1993 debts makes it possible to keep the 
finances within permissible limits. It is envisioned that 19 
trillion of this deficit will be covered by external borrowing, 
4.5 trillion by state bonds and the rest by credits from the 
Central Bank. 
  Boris Fyodorov makes a much more pessimistic appraisal. 
He believes that in reality the deficit of this year will exceed 
critical limits and reach 100 trillion rubles. 
  This will happen if the proverbial "financial blanket" is 
torn to pieces during and after the draft's discussion. But 
today I hold a more optimistic view. It is realistic to expect, 
under the draft budget, the reduction of inflation by the end of 
the year to 10% a month and maybe even lower. More serious 
results could be expected, but I am not sure this is realistic 
in the present situation. 
  By the way you are, along with the First Deputy 
Minister Andrei Vavilov, conducting another round of 
negotiations with IMF which usually links its credits to the 
realization of "more ambitious" results. 
  We expect representatives of the fund and the G-7 countries 
to also be realistic. No one hopes, of course, that they will 
pull us out of the crisis, but the situation would have been 
much more grave without their assistance. 
  What and who else do you count on? On just yourself? 
The question is not very correct, but aren't you pressed by the 
word "acting" preceding your title? 
  I find even some advantages in it, for nobody expects 
something special from me, but if I manage to do more... I count 
on the Finance Ministry's team which is a strong one largely 
thanks to Fyodorov. And I certainly count on the premier who 
supports our draft budget. This is important since, in my view, 
he is fully in control of the situation in the Cabinet. Finally, 
I count on cooperation with the Central Bank, without which it 
is difficult to think about financial stability. It was somewhat 
unexpected but we met with the Central Bank's call for even a 
"stronger" policy than the Finance Ministry itself planned. 
  How do you explain this? Is Mr. Gerashchenko satisfied 
with Fyodorov's departure and ready to offer his assistance? 
  I explain this by the fact that the Central Bank has looked 
beyond the edge of the abyss, has assessed the consequences of 
the possible financial injection of which we spoke. Everyone 
will have to answer for a collapse. The situation is very tense: 
one or two steps can lead us to conditions in which nobody will 
be able to do anything and a financial collapse will become 
inevitable. 
  According to forecasts, this may happen in the 
autumn. 
  This has an inertia of its own. The rise in prices occurs 
over two months, we inject money today and have a flare-up of 
inflation in two months. To start an uncontrolled hyperinflation 
would require, I think, six to seven months. Then we would have 
40% monthly inflation by autumn, 50% by the end of 
the year, 
and things would finally get out of control in the first quarter 
of the new year. I consider the prevention of hyperinflation my 
main task, although it is in fact only a minimum task, and I 
shall consider myself successful if inflation falls from its 
present level. 
  What do you consider the main threat? 
  It is the fact that our society is built on a corporative 
or, 
more simply, a sectoral basis. Various "corporations" are drawn 
into the escalation of demands. If this is not firmly resisted, 
in time the pressure will grow so that resistance will be almost 
useless. 
  Are you a supporter of high duties on imported 
goods? 
  I am ready to agree to demands for sky-high duties on the 
import of agricultural products based on the argument that every 
country in the world protects its own farmers by high taxes on 
agricultural imports. But then we must tell our consumers that 
this means a sharp rise in food prices. Second, we should look 
honestly at what will happen to our agricultural sector if it's 
protected from competition. Will this raise its efficiency or 
will it remain the same? It was protected before, why didn't it 
develop greater efficiency then? 
  The logic of producers is clear: the tax on imports 
should be raised and taxes on production should be lowered. An 
increasingly popular idea of late is that most taxes should be 
lowered or cancelled altogether and the budget should be formed 
from two sources: the tax on the extraction of raw materials and 
the tax on land. These taxes are easier to collect, incomes will 
be more stable, and manufacturing industries, freed from the tax 
pressure, will begin to develop. 
  But what will raw-materials' industries, crushed by this 
tax, 
begin to do? They will further raise prices of their goods which 
will reach manufacturers and affect them as badly as taxes do. 
  Do you think that the present tax system works well? 
Even though tax contribution to the budget has diminished? 
  It was about 16% of the gross national product in 
the first 
quarter of the last year, then went down to 9% and rose 
somewhat by the end of the year. Still I must say that the 
existing system works quite well. During two years we introduced 
a complicated tax, the VAT, which is functioning. 
  But the tax arrears are immense. 
  Let me specify. The arrears of taxes, which have been 
accurately calculated, total 4.5 trillion rubles. The defaulters 
have been identified, but they don't pay. Because they have 
nothing to pay with. 
  But besides, arrears there are sums which are concealed 
from taxation, which are, according to estimates, immeasurably 
higher. 
  They are great indeed, but I would not say that their share 
is unprecedented. In the United States with its immensely 
developed tax laws, great experience and "tax abiding" 
traditions, only 80% of tax that should theoretically be 
collected is actually collected, and 20% is concealed. We 
collect about 60%, which, incidentally, greatly impressed 
foreign financial experts who expected a much lower figure. But 
if you think that 40% of concealed taxes makes me happy 
you are 
badly mistaken. 
  Have you agreed to make very complicated and difficult 
decisions? 
  It seems to me that such decisions would have to be taken 
anyway. It is, of course, possible not to take them and let all 
proportions in the economy be formed in a purely market way, but 
they will actually develop under the powerful impact of various 
interests. It should be pointed out that interests within 
economy complexes, within industries are also contradictory. 
  Can the present government be successful? 
  It seems to me that the current government situation closely 
corresponds to the situation in society where none of the major 
political blocs has a stable majority. Any political homogeneous 
government would now serve as an object of political passions. 
But then any government formed by various forces as a coalition 
one would be much too amorphous and unable to do anything. Today 
we have a government of technocrats, managers of production who 
are prepared to obey the premier who is politically neutral 
enough. The president as well, did not align himself with a 
specific party during the elections. As a result, we have a 
government which can act more successfully in this situation 
than we could have expected.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker: "A Drowning Man Clutches At </F>
Straws"] 
  [Text] While angry and argumentative, the RSPP [Russian 
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] leaders, Messrs. 
Bolskiy and Vladislavlev, are able to ascertain "who is the most 
valuable from a historical standpoint." Meanwhile the leader of 
the association of goods manufacturers, Yuriy Skokov, expresses 
his presidential aspirations, while the producers themselves 
presented the president and the government with a package of 10 
proposals, after which the financial crisis, in their opinion, 
vanished as if by magic. As expected, they are raising as a 
matter of priority concern for politically oriented people, the 
development of an economic program and a strategy for structural 
reorganization that is "coordinated with the goods 
manufacturers." The allergy to all types of programs, declared 
earlier by them on more than one occasion, it turns out is 
rooted in the absence of a visa for the goods manufacturers for 
developed programs. With the removal of this ommision and 
"having assigned priorities and outlined effective methods for 
supporting them," the country can look boldly into the future. 
  Their advice is to slash the producers' nonpayments in a 
manner such that the government returns the debts to the rural 
areas -- whether or not the products were ordered by the state 
or they constitute a line in the budget is of little importance: 
the chief concern is whether or not the guns and butter are in 
the homeland's storage facilities, in accordance with the 
producer prices. The producers supplement the return of debts 
with a proposal to free the enterprises from bank credit 
interest rates, that is: in early 1993, the director seized 300 
million rubles and, taking inflation into account, can pay out 
40 million rubles. But this is not a limit for the "traders": 
they insist that they be granted two years of interest-free 
credit for augmenting their working capital. Meanwhile, no 
provision is made for such "ceilings" and if one recalls that 
commencing 1 January the balance value of the fixed capital of 
enterprises was increased on average by a factor of 25, then it 
becomes clear that such credit will prove to be very costly for 
the state. 
  The subject of taxes, which suppress production, and the 
instincts of entrepreneurship are found throughout the document 
of the goods manufacturers. A reduction in the total amount of 
tax to 35 percent is being proposed. Although wise in principle, 
this measure is long overdue. According to data supplied by 
Minfin [Ministry of Finance], in 1993 the proportion of taxes 
amounted to 23.4 percent of the VVP [gross domestic product], a 
reduction of 2.7 percent compared to 1992. With regard to the 
almost mandatory requirement of the producers, to release from 
taxation in 1994, with no restrictions or reservations, all 
resources actually intended for investment in production, it is 
appropriate to cite here an evaluation provided by the chairman 
of Goskomnalog [State Committee for Taxes]. Vladimir Gusev 
stated that enterprises make only weak use of the benefits 
allowed by law for taxing the profits used for production 
development, preferring to increase wages or to spend for social 
assistance. And the directors themselves, according to Minister 
of Labor Gennadiy Melikyan, are "taking advantage of the legal 
chaos and rapidly increasing their own wages." 
  It would seem that monthly earnings ranging from 2 to 7 
million rubles can furnish some comfort to a plant 
administration that is oppressed by reforms. But no, today their 
state of well-being is low. They think about the future, 
proposing to raise export duties such that energy carriers 
generally will not be exported. A similar thought prevails with 
regard to import rates -- to protect themselves from foreign 
competitors, although a flowery proposal is being developed: on 
the one hand, the duties must ensure a "sensible priority for 
domestic goods manufacturers and, on the other, they must 
destroy monopolism in the internal market." 
  The proposal "to introduce temporary state price regulation 
for primary energy resources, after first ensuring financial 
support for the extractive enterprises of initial processing," 
contains much that is interesting although high-sounding. That 
is, in all branches with the exception of TEK [fuel and energy 
complex], the prices are free and for TEK -- temporary 
subsidies, with the time period to be established later by the 
producers. It appears that they refer to these as "reforms -- 
for the people and not at their expense." In their present form, 
according to Yuriy Borodin, the general director of "Mashpribor" 
AO [joint stock company], the reforms pose a threat to the very 
existence of the nation and state." Hence the tenth point of the 
Proposal by the goods manufacturers is quite logical "to restore 
the thoughtlessly destroyed economic contacts with the republics 
which comprised the Soviet Union." 
  It is doubtful if the manifest of economic outsiders was 
adopted by the government as a guide to action. But it is 
interesting as an indicator of the frame of mind of a 
considerable portion of our domestic directorate.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kotelnikova: "The Prime Minister </F>
Re-establishes Management of the State Sector"] 
  [Text] The increased influence of the sectorial 
ministries on the activity of the cabinet of Viktor Chernomyrdin 
has permitted them to partially regain the positions with 
respect to enterprise management lost during the time of the 
reforms. The governmental decree "On Delegation of the Powers of 
the Government of the Russian Federation With Respect to the 
Management and Disposal of Federal Property Facilities," which 
was officially distributed yesterday, grants to sectorial 
ministries the right to determine personnel and production 
policy. It is obvious that by this decision the government not 
only seeks to re-establish the manageability of the state sector 
but also to constrict the influence on it of the State Committee 
on the Administration of State Property, which is to be 
restricted now to the monitoring of the use of state 
property. 
  The new governmental decision has the object of "improving 
the management of the state sector of the economy." The sector 
people lost their managerial functions already in the time of 
the "romantic" period of the reforms, after the liberalization 
of the economic activity of state enterprises. 
  According to the document adopted, management of the state 
sector is shared between the sectorial ministries and the State 
Committee on the Administration of State Property. The sectorial 
ministries have now been granted the right to conclude contracts 
with the managers of enterprises and to approve their charters 
while the State Committee on the Administration of State 
Property is to regulate, correspondingly, the specific-purpose 
use of state property. The document also permits the sectorial 
ministries to monitor the dimensions of the state sector. The 
point is that not only the creation of an enterprise but also 
its liquidation will require coordination with the sector 
people. In this connection the possibility of denationalizing 
enterprises through bankruptcy that is incorporated in the State 
Privatization Program is to be constricted. That is why the 
forecasts of the experts who thought that introduction of the 
institution of bankruptcy would neutralize the victory of the 
sector people, which involved the removal of enterprises from 
under denationalization (in the course of the months-long 
discussion of the State Program the restrictive list of 
enterprises not subject to privatization was increased from 30 
percent to 36 percent), are not justified. However, the consent 
of the sector people alone will be insufficient for the 
bankruptcy of an enterprise since it will be further necessary 
to obtain the "all right" of the local organs of executive power 
of the subjects of the federation. 
  The clear pro-sectorial direction of the document is 
obvious. 
Moreover, the unwarranted change in the powers of the State 
Committee on the Administration of State Property--their 
reduction to monitoring the use of an enterprise's property 
(minus management)--exceeds the limits of the existing normative 
base. That is why the Prime Minister has proposed that the State 
Committee on the Administration of State Property "adjust" its 
powers and submit the draft of a statute on the Russian 
Federation State Committee on the Administration of State 
Property to the government within a month. 
  If the State Committee on the Administration of State 
Property consents to the new distribution of functions, its 
status (now defined by law) as well as the influence of its 
leadership on economic policy will be substantially reduced. 
<H3>  Distribution of Powers Between the Sectorial Ministries and 
the State Committee on the Administration of State 
Property </H3>

  -  The sectorial ministries are granted the right to 
approve the charters of federal enterprises, to appoint and to 
dismiss the managers of federal enterprises, and to conclude, 
change and cancel contracts with these managers. The ministries 
also act as legal successors with respect to contracts 
previously concluded with the managers of federal enterprises by 
the organs of state administration of Russia, the former USSR 
and RSFSR, as well as by concerns, associations and other 
amalgamations of enterprises in the period when they were 
granted the corresponding powers. 
  -  The jurisdiction of the State 
Committee on the Administration of State Property entails the 
transfer of state property to full economic management and 
operational control, as well as to leasing and the right to use, 
by legal persons, and the monitoring of the specific-purpose 
utilization of state property.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Bochin, Chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support 
of New Economic Structures, by an unnamed IZVESTIYA 
correspondent; date and place not given: "The State is Obliged 
to Protect the Consumer from the Arbitrariness Which has Begun 
to Reign on the Russian Market"] 
  [Text] The Chairman of the Russian Federation State 
Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic 
Structures, Leonid Bochin, answers IZVESTIYA's questions. 
  [Correspondent] They told us about such a case recently in 
the State Trade Inspectorate: a store obtained ham from a local 
meat combine at 4,500 per kilogram each and, passing it off as 
imported, sold it quite openly and quite uninhibitedly at 18,000 
rubles each. Consumers are now being robbed everywhere and on a 
mass basis. In protecting their interests, they are compelled to 
unite in associations and parties. But what is the state 
undertaking for the protection of the rights of consumers? 
  [Bochin] Public organizations of consumers have begun to 
work 
really actively in some regions, but for the most part their 
organization is still only going on. The territorial 
administrations of the Antimonopoly Committee support this 
process in every way possible. However, the principal role in 
protecting the rights of consumers still belongs to state 
organs. Basing itself on the Law "On Protection of the Rights of 
Consumers," the Antimonopoly Committee alone has investigated 
16,000 citizen's appeals during the past year. As a result goods 
have been replaced, operations have been corrected and penalties 
paid, and moral and material losses to consumers amounting to 
hundreds of millions of rubles reimbursed. More than 600 
administrative actions have been brought. Representatives of the 
Antimonopoly Committee are active in the legal defense of 
consumers or assist them in the preparation of suits in court. 
We do this free of charge. 
  I can cite a lot of cases when people who have found 
themselves in a desparate plight have obtained justice with our 
help. For example, a person's Zhiguli was stolen from the paid 
parking lot of the oblast car-owners' council in Kursk last 
summer. No one wants to be answerable for this; the parking lot 
owner is not accepting claims. There was a vehicle--and it was 
gone. Then the victim appealed for help to the territorial 
administration of the Antimonopoly Committee. A trial took 
place. As a result a VAZ-21063 motor vehicle and a further 
R3,200,000 in compensation were recovered from the Kursk oblast 
council of the car owners' society to pay off the losses. 
  There are many such examples. However, I want to say that 
much depends on the consumers themselves. They should know that 
the law has given them significant rights which are protected by 
the state. 
  [Correspondent] Russia has been turned into a dump where 
they 
cart low-quality goods from all over the world. What is the 
Antimonopoly Committee doing to stop this flow? 
  [Bochin] Indeed, state monitoring of the implementation of 
the contracts of Russian firms with foreign suppliers is rather 
weak. Our merchants buy up a low-grade good at dumping prices, 
they carry it to Russia and don't encounter any particular 
obstacles. Deserving of censure, for example, is just one 
incident with Argentinian chickens which were brought into 
Russia through the Maritime Kray customs house. The chickens 
were slaughtered as far back as 1986-87 and had lain around a 
long time, since they hadn't sold because of low quality. And 
then the Russian merchants, who don't care a rap about their own 
people, turned up. They bought this trash and delivered it to 
the Far East without certificates of fitness. And no one has 
been able to stop this outrage. But such a fine should have been 
exacted from the firm that it would have forever lost the desire 
to import refuse quality products into Russia. 
  It is time to take measures on the state level about 
liability for trading in low quality goods. The Antimonopoly 
Committee has prepared its own proposals to the government about 
bringing the system for monitoring the safety of imported 
products into conformity with the legislation of Russia and 
international agreements. 
  [Correspondent] We had expected that the denationalization 
of 
trade would lead to the development of competition and this, in 
turn, would improve trade service and eliminate standing in 
line. But in the matter of trade, the producers of goods and 
services have remained monopolists who literally rob us. Dirt, 
lines, and rudeness everywhere. When will there be an end to 
this? 
  [Bochin] There is no longer monopolism in trade. During the 
last two years of the implementation of the program of 
small-scale privatization and of the demonopolization program 
one has succeeded in creating a competitive environment in 
retail trade. Some 32,000 stores and about 9,000 public catering 
enterprises have now been privatized in Russia. This constitutes 
65 and 61 percent of the total number respectively. 
  That the level of trade service, the number of stores, and 
even the number of those employed in trade as before does not 
correspond to the norms of developed countries is another 
matter. And I think that one should not expect fundamental 
changes too quickly. It needs to be taken into account that the 
same personnel and leadership have remained in the majority of 
stores. The majority of these people never will become civilized 
merchants. They trade as they are able to. However, even they 
will have to take the competition which has arisen into account. 
In particular, the emergence of unorganized street trade has 
forced the stores to expand assortment, to stick to acceptable 
prices, and even to improve somewhat in the organization of 
trade. 
  Matters are worse in wholesale trade, since here the 
creation 
of parallel structures is connected with the development of 
warehouses and transport support, and all this requires time and 
lots of money. 
  [Correspondent] What is the Antimonopoly Committee doing to 
develop competition on the consumer market? 
  [Bochin] Within the framework of the powers granted us we 
are 
bringing about the break up of the former trade organizations, 
trusts, and supply and sales structures into smaller units. We 
are providing support to small and medium-sized business through 
the creation of the approriate funds. In order for new 
monopolists not to arise in place of the former ones, we are 
keeping an eye on the creation, mergings, additions, and 
liquidations of economic subjects. Sometimes the activity of 
local organs of power and administration directed to the 
restriction of competition has to be stopped. We are monitoring 
enterprises and firms which occupy a dominating position in the 
market. If they begin to dictate conditions to consumers we have 
to intervene. 
  [Correspondent] Has the Antimonopoly Committee itself been 
endowed with sufficient rights so as to effectively protect the 
rights of the consumers? 
  [Bochin] Our rights and powers are defined by the Law "On 
Protection of the Rights of Consumers." However, I am convinced 
that effective practical work in resolving this problem is 
possible only with the interaction of all the interested organs 
of state power and surveillance. For this purpose we have 
developed an agreement which nine interested departments have 
signed. It is called "On Concerted Action for Ensuring State 
Protection of the Rights of Consumers of Goods, Work, and 
Services." Joint measures are outlined in this document, the 
results of which, I think, the citizens of Russia will soon be 
able to perceive.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Frolova: "Prices Will Be Re-evaluated"] </F>
  [Text] The Anti-Monopoly Committee of the RF [Russian 
Federation] has begun a check on the tariffs of the Ministry of 
Communications and other "natural monopolies." 
  At the last meeting of the Chamber for Information Disputes 
under the president of the RF, the second issue to come up had 
to do with delivery of newspapers and journals. A representative 
of the federal administration of postal communications stated 
that the postoffice as before intends to cover all its losses 
through an increase in prices for delivery of print media 
publications. Staff members of the anti-monopoly committee of 
the RF considered this a violation of the rights of consumers. 
The subscription price substantially exceeds the initial amount 
established by the editorial boards. 
  As the chief specialist for the state committee for 
anti-monopoly policy and support for new economic structures 
Aleksandr Kartashev explained to a correspondent of MOSKOVSKIYE 
NOVOSTI, the arbitrariness of postal prices can be stopped in 
two ways: by competition or by the state. For now, the postal 
department does not intend to share its authority with respect 
to subscriptions with any one. Consequently, almost every three 
months new tariffs are established, the basis of which it is 
impossible to check. This is because oblast postoffices have 
been removed from the control of financial and taxation organs 
and are answerable to no one except their own superiors. The 
situation can currently be changed only by the emergence of 
competition in the market of the distributors of print media 
publications. But the chief monopolist will be transformed into 
an ordinary participant in this market only after "delivery" 
enters the list of licensed services. 
  A check of the tariffs of the ministry of communications is 
being conducted by assignment of the government. The 
anti-monopoly committee intends to find out "whether the postal 
workers are not running ahead of inflation." In the first 
instance, specialists are analyzing prices for telephone calls, 
delivery of periodical publications, and other communications 
services. The results of the findings of this economic expertise 
will be announced at one of the next meetings of the 
government's commission for operational questions. 
  According to preliminary data, even in the absence of 
obvious 
violations in the actions of the ministry, the experts of the 
anti-monopoly committee intend to raise the question of a more 
precise specification of the organizational-legal structure of 
the postal department. And they also intend to press the 
question of whether post offices should be transformed into 
subordinate enterprises, which will compete on an equal footing 
with private firms in the delivery of print media publications. 
Only after this will delivery prices cease to rise.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Ivanovich Potapov, member of the Council </F>
of Russia's Association of Mortgage Banks, president of the 
Yunifyucher Firm: "Problems of Russian Mortgage"] 
  [Text] Mortgage in Russia is beginning to revive. 
Approaches to the extension of mortgage credits on the real 
estate market are being developed and standard credit products 
convenient for consumers are being created. Sergey Ivanovich 
Potapov, member of the Council of Russia's Association of 
Mortgage Banks, president of the Yunifyucher Firm, told our 
correspondent about the state of the mentioned problem and ways 
of solving it. 
  Talking about what is missing for the formation of a 
civilized real estate market in Russia, I want to dwell on the 
basic factors. First, the absence of a comprehensive mortgage 
law. Second, the absence of realistically operating mortgage 
mechanisms. Third, the absence of a unified computer service of 
registration of real estate facilities and deals with them. 
Fourth, the tax policy of the state does not fully take into 
account the justification for preferential terms for the 
subjects of the real estate market. Fifth, the training of new 
people working in this sphere has only begun. Sixth, the 
formation of a positive image. 
  The extension of mortgage credits is one of the elements 
necessary for the creation of market relations; of course, not 
only in the housing sphere. However, mortgage in its present 
sense does not yet exist in Russia. Today we have a very 
distinctive "mortgage," all the problems of which are caused by 
the crisis state of the economy and by the lack of a 
comprehensive legislative base, without which it is impossible 
to fully actuate the classic mechanism of extension of mortgage 
credits. 
  At the present stage, subjects of the real estate 
market--mortgage banks, insurance companies, available housing, 
independent appraisers, and real estate firms--cannot manage 
without state assistance. It is not a matter of monetary 
subsidies, which can only spur on inflationary processes. We 
expect the most rapid coordination of the "rules of the game" on 
the real estate market from the state. 
  At the same time, the Association of Mortgage Banks 
established in August of last year is the leading active 
lobbyist in the good sense of this word, which promotes the 
fermentation of the process of adoption of a comprehensive 
mortgage law. This law must take into account without fail the 
mortgage of housing, of nonresidential premises, of land, and so 
forth. It must expand the field of activity not only for banks, 
but also for the system of real estate appraisal and mortgage 
insurance, as well as for investment-construction companies. 
  In our country there is tremendous interest in mortgages. 
The 
number of mortgage banks is growing and their affiliates are 
being opened in Russian cities. According to the evaluations of 
our firm's experts, the extension of mortgage credits in Russia 
should attract no less than 50 percent of all the financiers. 
However, a great deal will have to be done to reach these goals. 
  In the real estate community there are two points of view of 
the formation of the legislative base in Russia--evolutionary 
and revolutionary. The advocates of the first assume that in a 
short time it is impossible to do with real estate legislation 
what in economically developed countries was perfected for 
centuries. Advocates of more radical views have a no less 
weighty argument: If we are unable to establish normal mutual 
relations on the real estate market, of course, taking the 
experience of other countries into consideration, we will 
definitely destroy the country's economy. 
  I think that this year is decisive and it will take place 
against the background of the integration of real estate and 
financial markets. In this connection the problem of an 
efficient utilization of real estate by its owners is of no 
small importance. Tens of thousands of real estate facilities 
throughout the country have already been privatized. Most of 
them, just as they did not see builders last year, so, very 
possibly, will not see them in the very near future. At the same 
time, the cost of leasing premises is rising steadily, which is 
due to the shortage of real estate equipped in accordance with 
elementary norms. Only economic levers, which bring about an 
efficient use of property, can change this situation. A property 
tax at the rate of 1 percent of the value of realistically 
appraised real estate is the simplest. The introduction of such 
a basic rate is next year's task. Without this the process of 
formation of the real estate market cannot be accelerated. 
  It must be stated that the body of directors of industrial 
enterprises, who are forced to attract credit resources and to 
interact with credit extending banks, are interested in the 
appraisal of a realistic property value. At the same time, 
insurance savings of enterprises will make up 5 to 8 percent. 
  With regard to construction organizations the problem of 
searching for finances in order to retain their house building 
collectives worries them more than making profits. For example, 
they are very interested in shareholding in housing construction 
and seek opportunities to attract the population's funds. Most 
builders believe that for the time being matters pertaining to 
the extension of mortgage credits, basically, are theoretical. 
In their opinion, there are very few real plans and practical 
achievements here. 
  For the most part Russian mortgage banks work with juridical 
persons. Some of them also tried to work with natural persons. 
However, they incurred neither substantial losses nor obtained 
profit and, therefore, abandoned such an activity. It must be 
admitted that, of course, mortgage banks managed to achieve 
something, but this represented only a small part of their 
potentials. I repeat: There is a need for a firm comprehensive 
legislative mortgage base, which unequivocally interprets the 
mortgage of land, of housing, and of nonresidential structures. 
  What positive sprouts are there? First of all, mortgage 
banks 
actively seek their market and conduct negotiations with 
investors and large organizations, which are ready to subsidize 
borrowers interested in mortgage credits. For example, Moscow's 
municipal council is ready to cooperate with some banks, which 
made a good showing, such as the Joint-Stock Mortgage Bank and 
the Standartbank. A draft decree of the municipal council on the 
development of the extension of mortgage credits in Moscow has 
been prepared and in accordance with it mortgage banks will be 
creditors for citizens on waiting lists for free municipal 
housing in local bodies of power. The municipal council intends 
to subsidize such credits through the commercial sale of 
municipal housing. Various big organizations can also play the 
same role as the municipal council. After all, all large 
monopolist enterprises build housing for their workers with 
their own funds. They are forced to do this and incur big 
expenses on the construction and operation of buildings. 
Therefore, they are interested in mortgage credit subsidy. This 
would enable them to relieve themselves of this problem and to 
transfer housing to the ownership of their workers. In order to 
ensure current expenditures, the bank must act as an ordinary 
commercial bank--to issue commercial credits and to actively 
operate on the interbank market. Banks began to establish 
subsidiary firms for operations on the real estate market and to 
ask well-known firms for assistance in the appraisal of 
residential and nonresidential premises and their sale if 
credits are not returned. For example, our firm has drafted a 
package of mutual contractual relations among the bank, the 
client, and the real estate firm concerning the appraisal and 
sale of an apartment not bought out by the client. 
  What should be done in order to attain progress in mortgage 
development in Russia? 
  Naturally, with the large number of credit products and 
their 
modifications it is difficult to get oriented in them. 
Therefore, if the opportunity of getting mortgage credits is now 
granted to our population, it will be sufficient to make do with 
only a small number of versions of credit products. This is 
convenient both for the bank and for the investor. It is simpler 
to buy up mortgages. If every mortgage is individual, it will 
not be possible to sell it wholesale on the secondary market. 
Let us turn to the concept of a "securities market." In what 
cases does it develop? When such a concept as the grade of a 
security appears. Owing to it, stocks and bonds find extensive 
application--they are the same, standard. When the moment comes 
that the market accepts only a small number of credit products, 
it will become very convenient for banks to operate. 
  The issue of mortgage credits by banks both to citizens and 
to juridical persons should become constant practice in bank 
operation. At first these will be credits within the framework 
of specific programs, where there are already investors and 
organizations ready to subsidize these credits. Such examples 
already exist. The Standartbank, which has begun such operations 
with the Kama Motor Vehicle Plant, can be mentioned. Several 
thousands of long-term credits have been issued at a low 
interest. This is a large-scale plan, according to which the 
issue of about 10,000 credits until 1995-1996 is anticipated. A 
great deal will depend on investors, that is, on the resources 
that they are prepared to invest in mortgages. Bank plans also 
include the extension of credits to private individuals. All 
over the world it is believed that for banks these are the least 
risky operations owing to the small sums. In the 19th century it 
was precisely the private issue of large credits into the same 
hands that was the cause of the collapse of the first commercial 
banks in Russia. As a rule, large amounts of credits are not 
issued to natural persons. However, the risk of nonreturn also 
exists. In order to reduce it, very serious prerequisites are 
needed. I will try to note the main ones: 
  1. The availability of reliable data on the borrower's 
income, which is necessary for an evaluation of his solvency. An 
efficient operation of the tax service is required for this. 
  2. The establishment of a bank of data on borrowers' credit 
histories at the level of cities and regions. If a person has a 
bad credit dossier, no bank will grant him credit. 
  3. Insurance companies must provide another type of 
service--insurance of the return of mortgage credits. 
  4. Firms insuring the purity of the title of ownership, 
which 
does not yet exist in our country, are needed. 
  It is very important to have reliable information on the 
value of real estate. Our firm--Yunifyucher--plans to 
computerize this kind of information all over Russia. We are 
mainly interested in the value of enterprises, office premises, 
and municipal housing so that our clients--banks and other 
financial institutions--may be able to use these data. 
Negotiations are now being conducted with several American 
firms, which have computer real estate bases both in the United 
States and all over the world. At our clients' requests we hope 
to receive information through the real estate telecommunication 
system operated by us. 
  There should be a surplus of information on the real estate 
market. True, everything depends on the condition of the real 
estate and where it is located. There are unfinished projects, 
with which nothing can be done--they are ruins. There are 
projects not meeting international standards, in which technical 
backwardness is inherent even at the planning stage. Foreign 
investors more often prefer to dismantle abandoned projects and 
to build in their places first-class hotels, profitable houses, 
and supermarkets. Unfinished projects must be sold at cut-rate 
prices, but economic sanctions must be established for those who 
simply stake out a claim in expectation of better times. Russia 
has lost too much, transferring money to foundation pits so that 
they may disfigure its appearance for a long time. There should 
be only economic levers here. But the scope for activity is 
wide. Firms working with real estate do not hamper each other. 
Specialization has already appeared: some are reconstructing 
private houses, some lease out housing, and some sell cottages 
with land plots. I will touch upon the characteristics of the 
Yunifyucher Firm, which I head. Its name reflects the idea of 
combining people's efforts for the creation of a worthy future. 
Our philosophy is based on the fact that we are surrounded not 
by competitors in the form of real estate firms, but by 
colleagues, together with whom we are creating a civilized real 
estate market. We are trying to counterpose the systems 
approach, "turnkey" work, and a system of guarantees for the 
client to amateur brokers. 
  About 970 firms connected with the buying and selling of 
dwellings advertise themselves in Moscow now. Things are going 
well for approximately 110 of them. Fifty such firms are former 
state structures established with large investments and, 
therefore, have strong starting positions. They had access to 
information and powerful connections, which at times plays a 
decisive role. However, private firms achieved everything by 
themselves, beginning from small things. For example, 
Yunifyucher had a charter fund of only 1,000 rubles. Like the 
legal association BAISO and the SAVVA Firm our firm has gained 
recognition only through its own efforts. 
  In June 1993 we presented the first real estate 
telecommunication system. The development of a remote access 
system is being completed now. It will enable our subscribers, 
sitting in Vladivostok, Yekaterinburg, San Francisco, or a dacha 
near Moscow, to communicate with Yunifyucher by telephone, to 
access our central computer, and to make any request in an 
arbitrary form. For example, there is a need for a prestigious 
office in the center of Moscow with an area of 200 square meters 
or a separate building in the capital. At present we are ready 
to discuss with interested financial institutions and legal 
structures the question of the establishment of a joint-stock 
company, which will introduce the real estate telecommunication 
system into the Russian market. 
  I will also touch upon the realtors' guild. It unites 
professionals and, therefore, the very participation in the 
guild gives a certain image to a firm and indirectly attracts 
clients to it. The guild raised the question of licensing real 
estate activity. When this is carried out, there will be fewer 
amateurs and simply incidental people in our business. In the 
United States there are brokers, who have received licenses and 
who are able to work on their own. The same can also be in our 
country. The fact that the guild gives information and 
methodological materials to its members is also important. It 
widely popularizes mortgage ideas, realizing what important 
place in its infrastructure is assigned to realtors. 
  I think that it is important for people who make decisions 
to 
pursue their policy in the real estate sphere through serious 
firms. After all, the wider the contact with professionals, the 
bigger the guarantees that policy in the real estate sphere will 
bring success in the realization of the housing program, 
development of cities, and an efficient utilization of our 
country's land.

<F P=106> [Article by Rustam Narzikulov: "Indexation of Bank Defects"] </F>
  [Text] Judging from the reaction of bankers, the decision 
of the Russian Federation Central Bank effective 1 March to 
raise the minimum amount of authorized capital of commercial 
banks from 100 million rubles [R] to R2 billion was unexpected 
not only by the mass media. The true motivation behind the 
20-fold indexation of the most important banking standard is not 
apparent either to the overwhelming majority of bankers or to 
Central Bank personnel themselves, although from the official 
point of view the actions of the Central Bank constitute a 
normal step on the path to achieving convergence of the Russian 
monetary system with international standards. 
  These include: mandatory increase of the minimum amount of 
authorized capital to 5 million ECU ($5.6 million) by 1 January 
1999; registration of new banks, effective 1 March 1994, with 
minimum amount of capital not less than 1 million ECU; and 
establishment of the norm for including material assets 
(building, equipment, etc.) within authorized capital--their 
share must not exceed 20 percent during the first year of the 
bank's operation, and cannot be less than 10 percent 
subsequently. 
  All these measures are directed, in the words of Dmitriy 
Tulin, deputy chairman of the Central Bank, towards "enhancing 
the responsibility of banks for services afforded" and 
overcoming "the absurd situation existing when it is easier to 
open up a commercial bank than a booth." 
  According to data as of 1 January 1994, 28 banks had 
ownership capital amounting to more than R5 billion; that of 138 
banks ranged from R1 to R5 billion. Thus, not more than 7 
percent of all Russian banks have any real prospect of falling 
within the norm established in accordance with recommendations 
of the European Community. With a more stringent valuation of 
fixed capital (factoring out translation gain/loss and 
undistributed profits, for example), their number is limited to 
just 100. The overwhelming majority of banks (about 1,500) have 
capital ranging from R100 million to R1 billion, and 272 of 
them--less than R100 million overall. 
  The flea-sized dimensions of many banks reflect the fact of 
the shortage of capital, so deplorable for the Russian economy, 
while the main problem in the poor quality of banking services 
is still the consequence of unmanageability of the banking 
system on the part of the Central Bank. This unmanageability is 
explained primarily through appreciable criminalization of the 
most profitable sector of the economy today, and therefore the 
indexation of capital in and of itself will not force banks that 
are violating legislation to alter their behavior. 
  Nevertheless, the increase in minimum amount of bank capital 
could be characterized as a first step of the Central Bank to 
improve the banking system if it is incapable of taking other, 
more radical steps, or if these are impossible by virtue of the 
system's high propensity for crime. However, another decision of 
Viktor Gerashchenko adopted several days earlier--on the virtual 
reconstruction of a very large special bank in the form of "the 
holding company Promstroybank"--is somehow too closely related 
to his telegram of yesterday to appear coincidental. 
  If this theory is confirmed, then the resoluteness with 
which 
Mr. Gerashchenko is pursuing European standards will indeed rid 
the newborn special institutions of tiny competitors, and will 
rid Russia--not suffering from an overaccumulation of capital as 
things are--of 95 percent of its banks.

<F P=106> [Article based on RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA information under the </F>
rubric "Business News": "Bankers Bet on Solidarity"] 
  [Text] A general meeting of partners of Solidarity 
Bank, at which the results of two years of operation of the 
banking collective were summed up, has been held in Moscow. 
  Aleksandr Zaikin, chairman of the board of the bank, told 
the 
audience: "Indicators of our operations are closely associated 
with the situation of the bank's founders, among which we can 
point out the FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of 
Russia], the Social Insurance Fund of the Russian Federation, 
and some others, as well as our numerous business partners. The 
reinforcement of the financial standing of our colleagues and 
clients is behind the 13-fold increase in the statutory fund, 
the 13-fold increase in assets, and the 20-fold increase in 
transactions on the balance-sheet accounts of the bank." 
  In the opinion of independent experts, Solidarity Bank is 
among the most stable and rapidly developing in Russia. In 
particular, this was facilitated by the orientation of the 
collective of the bank toward ensuring the complete automation 
of financial transactions. Solidarity has implemented a network 
version of an automated accounting system. Clients of the bank 
are offered the use of the "Bank-Client" system which makes it 
possible to make payments and receive original banking documents 
directly in one's office. 
  Recently, Solidarity Bank received a license to conduct 
operations in foreign exchange which has considerably expanded 
the list of services it provides and made it possible to 
strengthen contacts with quite a number of the largest trade 
union banks of Europe such as, for example, the Norwegian 
Landsbank. 
  The meeting of Solidarity's partners unanimously approved 
the 
report of the board of the bank and once again elected Aleksandr 
Zaikin as its president, thus showing complete confidence in him. 
  Yuriy Shatyrenko, chairman of the Social Insurance Fund of 
the Russian Federation, was elected chairman of the bank council.

<F P=106> ["Proposal for the Government and President of the Russian </F>
Federation Concerning Urgent Measures To Overcome the Financial 
Crisis of Manufacturing Enterprises" under the rubric "The 
Nonpayment Crisis": "Businessmen Want To Work for the Benefit of 
Russia"] 
  [Text] 
  1. An economic program and a strategy for structural changes 
in the economy that are coordinated with manufacturers should be 
developed and released, with priorities pointed out and 
effective ways for their support and development outlined, 
including those in the area of conversion. 
  2. The country's problem of nonpayments, which is rooted in 
the failure of the state to honor its obligations to pay 
industrial and agricultural enterprises for products, should be 
solved. 
  The state's debt to defense enterprises, the agrarian 
sector, 
and the spheres financed from the budget should be settled. 
  An amnesty should be implemented for the status as of 1993 
with regard to arrears in the payment of interest for the use of 
bank credit and in penalties of all types for delays in 
compulsory payments. 
  3. In 1994, the upper limit of all types of taxes actually 
paid and other compulsory payments made by manufacturers of 
goods should be restricted to a level not exceeding 35 percent 
of the actual generated profits. 
  The rate of tax on property should be restricted to a volume 
of no more than 0.1 percent of the book value, with depreciation 
factored in. 
  4. Funds allocated by manufacturers to replenish their 
proprietary working capital should be exempted from taxation in 
1994 without any restrictions or qualifications; to this end, 
manufacturers should also be granted the right to interest-free 
tax credit with a repayment term of 24 months. 
  5. All funds actually allocated as investment in production 
should be exempted from taxation in 1994 without any 
restrictions or qualifications. 
  6. A special bank investment rate shall be set at a level 
not 
to exceed one-third of the discount rate of the Central Bank on 
loans used for housing construction. 
  7. The standard duration of postal transit in the processing 
of payments by banks should be established. 
  The sender and recipient banks should be charged with 
monitoring the duration of payment processing and should be 
granted the right to debit from the guilty parties without 
acceptance, for the benefit of the sender enterprise, fines for 
delaying payments in the amount of two times the discount rate 
of the Central Bank of Russia, on the basis of the registration 
dates of payment documents. 
  8. Export duties on raw-material commodities should be set 
in 
1994 at levels equalizing domestic and world prices. 
  Import duties on goods should be set in 1994 at levels 
which, 
on one hand, ensure reasonable priority for domestic 
manufacturers of similar goods while, on the other hand, 
destroying monopolies on the domestic market. 
  Technical equipment and subcontracted parts imported for the 
purpose of manufacturing competitive products should be exempted 
from customs duties on imports. 
  9. Temporary state regulation of prices for primary energy 
resources should be introduced, ensuring financial support for 
extractive enterprises at the initial stages out of funds 
especially created to this end, gradually reducing subsidies as 
the economy is restructured. 
  10. The thoughtlessly destroyed economic relations with 
republics that belonged to the Soviet Union should be restored, 
and artificial barriers in the path of the movement of 
merchandise and money should be removed.

<F P=106> [Article by the Trade Union Information Center under the </F>
rubric "FITUR": "The North Does Not Forgive Deceit"] 
  [Text] At present, our entire country is in a calamitous 
situation. However, it is particularly hard on northerners. If 
it were not enough that they live under the most severe climatic 
conditions, they fail to get their wages for months at a time. 
  The hopes attached to the enactment of the Law on State 
Guarantees and Compensation for Individuals Working and Residing 
in the Regions of the Far North and Areas Equated With Them on 1 
June 1993 were dashed. A number of statesmen have come to wish 
for the northerners to be deprived of even the relief envisioned 
in the document. As we have learned, this was discussed on 13 
December 1993 at a conference with First Deputy Prime Minister 
Ye. Gaydar (by now, the former first deputy prime minister). On 
instructions from the conference, the Ministry of Finance 
prepared for the government proposals of precisely this nature 
to be subsequently submitted to the Federal Assembly. 
  The FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia] 
considers such a decision impermissible. Social tension in a 
number of northern regions has reached the limit; the labor 
collectives of many industries are on a pre-strike status. 
Because of this, the FITUR was forced to approach the head of 
the government, V. Chernomyrdin, as well as the chairman of the 
State Duma, I. Rybkin, with the request to provide for 
reinforcement of rather than reduction in socioeconomic 
protections for the residents of the North. 
  What caused this? The law proposed by the Ministry of 
Finance 
omits the highly significant words "state guarantees and 
compensation." The reference is simply to "guarantees and 
compensation". That is to say, it is proposed that the issues of 
survival be resolved on the principle "to rescue the drowning is 
up to the drowning themselves." This begs a reasonable question: 
Why does a state need rulers who do not guarantee anything to 
their subjects? 
  How does the Ministry of Finance justify the intention to 
omit the guarantees of the payment of regional coefficients and 
percentage bonuses in addition to the wages of the northerners? 
By the fact that the list of areas classified as regions of the 
Far North and localities equated with them has been changing 
continuously. (What if the North Caucasus lays a claim to 
preferences tomorrow?) However, the northerners will get a great 
"benefit" from a proposal in Article 12: "The combined volume of 
the payment of regional coefficients and percentage bonuses in 
addition to the wage of one worker per month shall be restricted 
to six times the minimum monthly volume of remuneration for 
labor." 
  One gets the impression that the people in the Ministry of 
Finance are simply unaware of the fact that regional 
coefficients and bonuses were introduced in the North in 
conjunction with sharp differences between local prices for 
consumer goods, foodstuffs, and services from prices "on the 
mainland." They were introduced in conjunction with special 
geographic, natural, and climatic conditions of the North. As 
residents of these regions state, the cancellation of 
coefficients and bonuses will reduce their wages by 60 percent. 
Between 70 and 75 percent of employees will end up below the 
physiological subsistence minimum. 
  The losses that northerners will suffer, if the proposals of 
the Ministry of Finance are accepted, are not restricted to 
those enumerated. Preferences for women and a block of articles 
concerning retirement benefits will also be abolished. Extra 
leave and the right to free passage to the site of vacation, the 
right to tax relief for enterprises manufacturing consumer goods 
and agricultural products, and so on will be restricted. 
  Of course, we cannot say that the developers of proposals 
that infringe on the rights of Northerners have acted on their 
own whim. They were prompted to do so by the most acute crisis 
in the economy. At the same time, they cannot slice through 
living flesh in this way, dooming millions of our fellow 
citizens to the status of Siberian hostages.

Androsenko: "The Moscow Chokehold Around Kolyma's Neck"] 
  [Text] Magadan--It turns out that there has not been, 
nor is there now in our government, anyone more preoccupied with 
ideas of social fairness than Ye. Gaydar, leader of Russia's 
Choice, and his team. The gap in incomes has made life 
unbearable for them. So they wanted to make everyone equal. 
  True, the excessive wealth detected by the worthy 
reformers was not at all in the possession of the latter-day 
nouveaux riches, but in the possession 
of...Northerners--doctors, teachers, librarians, and 
pensioners--who are supposedly receiving enormous sums for 
nothing. And they propose only one way of eliminating this 
"crying injustice": to take away the northern and regional 
coefficients and to make everyone equally indigent. 
  Yes, it was this very topic that was discussed on 15 
December 
of last year by Yu. Yarov, E. Pamfilova, and others who had 
gathered at Ye. Gaydar's office. In the draft edict of the 
president, hastily put together in the bowels of the Ministry of 
Finance on instructions from the high-level gathering, this is 
directly stated: "The existing system of benefits and 
compensations (for Northerners) levels the measures taken by the 
president and the Government of the Russian Federation on social 
protection of the needy and insufficiently provided-for strata 
of society, and it increases the inequality of citizens who are 
living in the same climatic conditions and receiving benefits 
for the discomfort of their living conditions. A significant 
disproportion in incomes of separate strata of the population 
has become apparent in the payment of regional coefficients and 
percentage wage increases in the regions of the Far North, and 
in localities and regions of equal status, where regional 
coefficients have been established by legislation currently in 
force." 
  Further, the Council of Ministers is given the instruction: 
"In one month's time, prepare the appropriate decision, meaning 
the revocation of baseless benefits and compensations, and the 
elimination of disproportions in the incomes of separate strata 
of the population due to paid benefits and compensations and the 
limiting of the total size of payments of regional coefficients 
and percentage wage increases to six times the amount of the 
minimum monthly wage." 
  In the regular draft law on the North that is affixed to the 
edict, many of the compensations won by the working people have 
been revoked (for instance, paid fare to a vacation place once 
every two years), and the previous law, which had been worked 
out with such assiduity and adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the 
Russian Federation, has been, to all practical purposes, 
liquidated. 
  But we shall see what the measures proposed by Ye. Gaydar, 
B. 
Fedorov, and company (I speak of these people advisedly, for 
despite the formal exit of these gentlemen from the government, 
it is precisely now that their drafts are being intensively 
"forced through") will bring the Far North and its inhabitants. 
The edict will concern primarily workers paid from the budget 
and workers in subsidized sectors. And to a greater degree, 
even, than proposed by the rosy-cheeked fighters for justice. 
The point is that in the packet of affixed documents, the 
guarantees and compensations are called state ones, although 
their carrying out is entrusted to enterprises and 
organizations, and also to local budgets. Considering their 
disastrous position, it is possible to say straight out: 
Compensations will inevitably be curtailed, with the exception, 
perhaps, of payments of the above-mentioned sixfold minimum 
wages. Will they cover the real needs of northerners? 
  Today the total sum of the regional coefficients and 
northern 
supplements in regions of the Far North fluctuate between 150 
percent and 200 percent. That is, with the payment of a base 
salary of 100,000 rubles [R], the worker is entitled to another 
R150,000 or R200,000. Is this a lot or a little? 
  The cost of food products in Kolyma is seven or eight times 
higher than in Moscow, and four times higher than in the Far 
East. A loaf of bread, for example, costs R1,500 here; a liter 
of milk, R3,000; 10 eggs, R4,000; and a kilogram of meat, 
R15,000. The basket of physiological survival--of the minimum 
selection of food products capable just barely of sustaining 
life--cost R70,000 in Magadan in December, and in the backwoods 
of the oblast it cost R120,000. 
  But after all, a person wants not only to survive, but to 
live--to eat, drink, clothe himself, and support his family in 
normal fashion. Until now, workers paid from the budget, thanks 
to a contrasting replacement of coefficients, have been able to 
maintain their not very substantial existence. At the end of 
last year their average salary in Chukotka amounted to 
R150,000-R180,000, which is already higher than the level that 
the Gaydarites propose to establish. But in fact since the new 
year, prices, running ahead of the wage increase promised by the 
president, surged sharply higher. 
  The cost of electricity, heating, and hot and cold water is 
going up by a factor of five; apartment rents are going up 
10-fold. By May, specialists predict an increase in the price of 
a liter of milk to R5,000 in Magadan and to R8,000 in Kolyma, 
and the price of 10 eggs, to R6,000-R9,000. These prognoses, 
without a doubt, will prove justified, for a lack of fodder has 
compelled the slaughter of cows and hens--their numbers now 
amount to a third of what they were before the reforms. This 
means that in the near future we must expect a four- or fivefold 
increase in the cost of living, at a minimum. 
  The rottenest thing about it is that the northerner has 
nowhere to go from this hopeless situation. He can no longer go 
anywhere from here. Just one ticket, for instance, from Susuman 
to Novosibirsk costs half a million rubles. And with all one's 
household things--R3-4 million. Whereas according to the latest 
government decree, a person moving away from Kolyma can receive 
for his vacated housing only 10 minimum wages for every year 
worked. That is, for 20 years of northern work, a person is 
entitled to an amount that is insufficient even to pay for his 
freight. 
  And such a "good life" brings down on northerners the 
accusation of extravagance. Oh Lord, what is it that makes those 
in power hate their own people so? 
  The Magadan association of trade unions called on the 
citizens of Kolyma actively to oppose the adoption of these 
acts. "The main thing here is not to allow the signing by the 
president of the draft edict prepared by the Ministry of 
Finance," says the chairman of the association, A. Makhankov. 
"The draft law must be discussed in the Federal Assembly, where 
it will inevitably be voted down. But the edict, having become a 
fait accompli, will make the defense of northerners' vital 
interests immeasurably more difficult." 
  And that is why rallies are being held at enterprises in the 
oblast, and an appeal is being drafted to the government and the 
president, protesting against the new infringement of the rights 
of northerners. 
  A fundamentally different attitude toward these events is 
being expressed by the oblast administration. "Inflaming popular 
opinion, the trade unions are pursuing their own political 
ends," believes its head, V. Mikhaylov. "No one has come to 
discuss these documents with us by the official channels, and 
therefore we cannot believe just any conjecturings." In other 
words, the administration considers what is happening to be 
merely provocation on the part of the trade unions, resting on 
no real grounds. 
  The administration is playing games. The trade unions 
provided it with copies of the documents put "into production" 
by the Gaydarites.

  How a Successful Bryansk Plant That Made It to the 
World Market With Its Unique Product Sustained Crushing Losses 
Caused by Ideas of Homegrown Radical Reformers 
  There is little to cheer about in factory life these 
days. Nevertheless, until recently the Bryansk Machine Building 
Plant [BMZ] seemed to be a happy exception to the rule. The BMZ 
Association had integrated into the world division of labor 
earlier than many Russian enterprises. Thanks to many years of 
close cooperation with the well-known European firm 
Man-Burmeister and Wein Diesel AO [name as transliterated], 
Bryansk ship diesels sell well among ship owners of many Western 
countries. This brought our producer the desired foreign 
currency and some economic independence. I am convinced that the 
BMZ can serve as a model for Russian industry's entry into the 
world market. 
  Actually, the famous formula "do as I do and you will 
succeed" requires some clarification in this case. This 
industrial giant's road to the market is far from being the 
result of the current economic reform. The foundation for 
integration was laid at the time Aleksey Kosygin headed the 
government. The advance technical base developed in the 1960's 
and subsequent years. But on top of that it took several decades 
to adapt to the world of Western business. Our mentor and 
companion all these years was one of the oldest engineering 
firms in West Europe with an impeccable reputation. 
  This latter circumstance to a large extent predetermined our 
success. And this is what we need to remember: The circles where 
the company, whose name begins with "Man," rules, do not accept 
novices and strangers. There is apparently no other road to 
success in the West. Most Russian goods producers today do not 
have such a unique experience in working with Western partners. 
Nevertheless, all want access to the world market, the road to 
which is simply closed to many. We, on the other hand, 
habitually explain first failures as intrigues of capitalist 
monopolies, who do not want to see Russia as a worthy partner. 
  The situation is somewhat more complex. We have lived in a 
closed economic space at the time when the world was going 
through integration. Integration of financial power; 
concentration of scientific and technical intellect; settling 
spheres of influence. The militarized, secret Soviet industry, 
with all its technical achievements, remained on the wayside of 
the world integration process, and no laments, obligations to 
put one's life on the line, or shock therapy experiments will 
reduce this lag, will relieve Russian producers of the necessity 
to go through a natural, rather lengthy process of adaptation in 
the world community. By the way, our air and space industry is 
embarking on the beginnings of this road--they have signed 
agreements on joint projects with U.S. companies. 
  At different times over a number of years I was present at 
key negotiations between the Bryansk Machine Building Plant and 
Western partners. There were moments when the fate of subsequent 
relations with companies hung in the balance depending on the 
last word of our general director. The negotiations scenario is 
routine: We are offered cooperation on terms by which we have to 
give up a considerable part of our own profit; if this is not 
acceptable, negotiations inevitably fail. 
  After one such climactic moment, which resulted in signing a 
long-term agreement, I had a frank conversation with BMZ General 
Director Artur Chebrikov. 
  "If you did not accept the terms, what would be the 
consequences?" was my question. 
  "Lamentable," summed up Chebrikov. "Our country would have 
to 
cease production of ship diesels within the next few years. We 
would begin buying the same kind of diesels in other countries 
and equip our sea vessels with them." 
  "But our diesels are as good as foreign, are they not?" 
  "They are just as good," agreed Chebrikov. "But the Man-B. 
&amp; 
W. Diesel AO controls the world network of company service and 
maintenance of sea transport, and in the event we break our 
relations no service will be available in any port for vessels 
equipped with Bryansk diesels. Then no ship owner will want to 
buy BMZ products." 
  This is how small the world is. 
  Chebrikov accepted all the terms of the firm, and in the 
final count the contract turned out profitable for both sides. 
Actually, even more profitable than all previous contracts: In 
the past, Bryansk diesel-builders themselves searched for buyers 
for their products; after signing this deal, the Germans and 
Danes took this responsibility, and they know the Western market 
far better than we do. 
  Orders from leading ship-building companies started pouring 
as if from the horn of plenty. At the same time, the firm was 
extremely conscientious in fulfilling obligations with respect 
to technical cooperation. The West's good will also showed 
during those difficult times for BMZ when the Union Government 
confiscated the foreign currency holding in the plant's 
accounts. Chebrikov ran up a considerable debt to his partners. 
But the Germans were patient, did not break relations. Debt 
deferment helped our side to resolve the problems of financing, 
pay off old debts, and get on its feet. 
  The Western business world needs the peaceful Russian might. 
Farsighted people in Europe do not live day by day. It all 
depends on how things will proceed with respect to our own 
reforms. But even with respect to such "market" enterprise as 
BMZ's one cannot say with certainty that the crisis is over. 
  A year ago it looked like the Bryansk Machine Building 
Plant, 
with numerous orders from the West, had all the chances of 
avoiding the problems that are rocking Russia today. The 
powerful Man-Burmeister and Wein teamed up Bryansk 
diesel-builders with its subsidiary Holeby [as transliterated], 
a world-recognized authority in the area of design and marketing 
of auxiliary ship diesels. New profitable orders came. In the 
current year of 1994, BMZ will build 30 ship diesels. Last year 
they built 26; a year before, 22. Our industry has not seen such 
dynamic growth for a long time. 
  It is even more regrettable that success in the world market 
does not make the life of this labor collective easier. The 
enterprise's situation today differs little from the lot of 
troubled Russian plants that have found themselves on the verge 
of bankruptcy. Alas, one cannot build a market economy on the 
territory of one separate oblast or factory. 
  The BMZ combines several major production facilities. The 
state of the world market for ship diesels was favorable, but 
the rest of the output has always been oriented towards domestic 
needs. And that single country no longer exists. 
  As a result of the Belovezha impromptu, BMZ lost its 
traditional market in Ukraine and Central Asia. The Ministry of 
Railroads found itself insolvent. There are no buyers today for 
freight railcars, refrigerator sections, diesel locomotives and 
engines for them, as well as consumer goods. 
  Forced lengthy stoppages of these productions followed. 
About 
1,000 workers were sent on an indefinite leave. But these people 
need to be paid at least a minimal allowance. It amounts to 
R15,000 rubles a month. In 1993, BMZ began to irretrievably lose 
highly skilled cadres. Low-skilled workers, whose services these 
days could be dispensed with, on the contrary, hold on tight to 
their jobs. Labor veterans also are seen as an additional burden 
today. There are about 3,000 of them still working today. They 
are the first candidates for layoffs, but the process probably 
will not be limited to just pensioners. 
  Without producing material goods, unneeded people live today 
at the expense of those who have jobs. One salary is sometimes 
shared by two, three, or four. There is a rumor that CIS 
railroads are on the verge of collapse. Unless mass replacement 
of the rolling stock is undertaken within the next two years, we 
will have a situation similar to the times of the civil war. 
This brings a weak hope for revival. The hope is based not on 
real credits or investment, but on the anticipation of 
irreversible ruin. 
  The BMZ Association today resembles an air balloon that is 
rapidly losing altitude. The travelers, in order to save 
themselves, hurriedly dispose of extra weight on board. What 
gets sacrificed are child care facilities, recreation bases, a 
sports school, housing construction, municipal services, and 
jobs. True, the association earned a R12-billion profit over the 
past year, but it is also owed the same amount by insolvent 
customers. 
  The insolvency crisis is exacerbated by the thoroughly 
corrupt financial and banking systems. As is known, a market is 
based on the reciprocal movement of goods and money supply. 
Success comes to those who can ensure for themselves a high 
velocity of capital turnover. The higher the velocity, the 
greater the profit, and the greater the working capital savings. 
  In the world of civilized market economics the 
procedure of completing a payment is measured in minutes. Under 
Gaydar, a new procedure was put in place whereby payments take 
two to three weeks to reach their destination, or sometimes 
"wander around" for months. Other people's money that is not 
transferred to its proper owner in a timely manner, is put into 
turnover, bringing considerable profits to speculators and 
dishonest bureaucrats. This is how initial capital is 
accumulated. 
  It appears that things have been straightened out under 
Chernomyrdin. Now payments sent by telegraph take three days. 
Regular payments--one week. At the same time, the problem of 
clearing with Ukraine and the other CIS countries has not been 
resolved. Gaydar proclaimed presumptuously that he had put in 
place the foundations of market structures in Russia. But if 
this is a market, then it would be appropriate to remind that 
during the notorious times of stagnation the planned system, 
with all its vices, ensured that payments reached addresses in 
any point of the Soviet Union within hours. 
  What meaning then does Yegor Timurovich put in the 
notion of "market?" 
  The Bryansk Machine Building Plant is not isolated from 
Russian reality. Income earned from ship diesel production keeps 
the association's entire infrastructure afloat. There are simply 
no other sources today for propping up the shaky financial 
situation. There is an earring for each sister, and in the final 
count the general financial collapse is avoided only thanks to 
foreign currency earnings. 
  The forecast for 1994 also is bleak. Further sharp decline 
is 
expected in orders for freight railcars, diesel locomotives, 
engines for them, and refrigerator sections. Entire plants will 
be idled for long periods of time, as happened quite recently in 
automobile building. 
  The enterprise leadership no longer speaks of the 
possibility 
of averting mass unemployment, but hope to at least preserve the 
skeleton cadres. The list of insolvent debtors is growing 
menacingly fast. Ukrainian ship builders owe BMZ R7 billion. To 
refuse to ship more products means to lose the plant's 
traditional distribution market for a long time. But working for 
free for an Ukrainian uncle also means neglecting one's own 
needs. 
  This was the situation at the time the plant approached the 
new phase of the reform, widely promoted by the well-supervised 
press. What a tempting word: privatization. It means transfer of 
the state-owned depersonalized property into the hands of real, 
judicious owners. The BMZ has just been proclaimed a joint-stock 
society. Today this major industrial enterprise is owned by 
27,000 people. 
  But the social portrait of the new owner comes out one-sided 
and faceless. It is workers and office workers who have been 
practically reduced to the status of lumpens, temporarily 
unemployed, and pensioners. In short, the same hired labor, 
which now has also lost the right to social protection, unsure 
even of tomorrow. Are these the owners, free proprietors, 
independent from the state and the rulers? According to Mr. 
Chubays, it appears to be so... 
  The status of owner does not elicit any enthusiasm 
among the newly-baked stockholders-capitalists. The enterprise 
cannot give anything today to its nominal owners. Forget 
dividends! The "owners," stockholders cannot even get an 
elementary guarantee of the right to keep their jobs. 
  And the "owners" themselves cannot offer the plant, 
which theoretically belongs to them personally, anything but 
their own pair of working hands. The Bryansk Machine Building 
Plant Joint-Stock Society, however, at this point has no need 
for this valuable--or at least this is what we have been taught 
under socialism--capital. 
  One has to admit that the new interpretation of the 
famous slogan "he who had been nothing will become everything," 
for the sake of which, actually, the people rose in defense of 
the White House and President Yeltsin in August 1991, clearly 
has suffered an utter defeat. More than anything, the BMZ 
Joint-Stock Society needs credits, investment, orders, 
distribution markets. There are no rich owners, however, among 
the stockholders. 
  And where are our Russian banks and investment funds? 
Created, in theory, for the purpose of supporting domestic 
industry by financial resources, all they have been able to 
accomplish so far is loud, to the point of vulgarity, 
self-advertising on television. They also have enough drive to 
engage in speculative operations in playing the dollar exchange 
rate, Royal spirits, and Snickers. Russian foreign currency 
accumulates in foreign banks. 
  BMZ General Director Artur Chebrikov and other enterprise 
managers had entertained some hope that Western partners would 
show some interest in the stock of the Bryansk joint-stock 
society. The Man-B. and W. Diesel AO does not display any such 
interest in Russian affairs, however. What capitalist would 
assume somebody else's headache? And with it, the burden of 
crashing state taxes, the responsibility for others' debts and 
others' unemployed? 
  The ideal of the proclaimed Russian reform was the revival 
of 
the owner, a proprietor free from the state. The outcome of the 
two-year-long exhausting shock therapy epic shows that Russia 
today is farther away from the conceived goal than it was at the 
beginning of this road. 
  The result of privatization according to Gaydar and Chubays 
is property that is still ownerless, but on top of this, is now 
lumpenized. This is a terrible result for a great country at the 
finish of the century. We were promised the rebirth of a class 
of proprietors. But today all that looms over nationalized 
factories and plants is the specter of common proletarian 
poverty.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Bobkov, RF VTsUZh director, and A. Razumov, </F>
RF VTsUZh deputy director: "Standard of Living for Russia and 
Its Regions"] 
  [Text] The problem of the standard of living under 
conditions of radical transformations is at the center of 
society's attention. In complex scientific studies by the 
All-Russian Center for the Standard of Living [VTsUZh] under the 
Russian Federation [RF] Ministry of Labor, official statistics 
based on data from the RF Goskomstat (State Committee for 
Statistics) have been used along with the VTsUZh's own 
calculations, which are based on original methods that make it 
possible to obtain comparative estimates of the level and 
dynamics of real incomes and personal consumption for Russia's 
regions. The VTsUZh is also conducting selective sociological 
research among the population in order to determine the 
connections between the level of material provision of the 
members of the families studied, on the one hand, and their 
status (employment, behavioral motivation, and so on) in the 
labor market, on the other. 
  The standard of living represents the degree of development 
and satisfaction of needs for the individual living in a 
society. In accordance with Article 25 of the ILO Convention "On 
the Basic Goals and Norms of Social Policy" No. 117, an 
individual has the right to the standard of living, including 
food, clothing, housing, medical care, and social services, 
necessary to maintain his own health and well-being and that of 
his family, as well as the right to provision in the event of 
unemployment, disability, widowhood, or other instance of the 
loss of the funds for existence due to circumstances beyond his 
control. According to a U.N. recommendation, the standard of 
living is measured by a system of indicators characterizing 
health, consumption level, employment, education, housing, and 
social provision. 
  The most general measure of a population's standard of 
living 
is its real income as a monetary measure of all goods received 
in the course of a given period on a per capita basis. With 
inflationary processes, the necessity arises to assess these 
incomes, and above all salary, according to their purchasing 
capacity, i.e., corrected for the price index. 
  Real monetary income for the Russian population at the end 
of 
1992 was 96.4 rubles [R] (in 1983 prices) per capita per month. 
Analysis of the dynamics of real monetary income for Russia as a 
whole for the period 1992 to July 1993 attests to their 
vacillating nature due to the time lag between the dynamic of 
monetary income for the population and the dynamic of prices. 
According to our calculations, real monetary income for the 
Russian Federation in the third quarter of 1993 was less than 
two-fifths of what it was in the fourth quarter of 1991. 
  One reason for this level of real monetary income lies in 
the 
fact that minimum levels for wages, pensions, stipends, 
subsidies, and other social outlays have been reviewed 
quarterly, resulting in a substantial lag behind price rises. 
With the increase in inflation, this has led to a growth in 
poverty. 
  We see an obvious rift between the tendency of prices to 
approach the world level and the relative devaluation of Russian 
manpower. The lack of development of the labor market and the 
absence of objective price setting, including for manpower, 
encourage a specific and growing portion of the population to 
engage in activities in economically and socially ineffective 
spheres (the shadow economy, speculation, resale, and so forth). 
New strata of the population are being formed, including 
entrepreneurs, with high and super-high monetary incomes. On the 
other hand, the portion of the population doomed to poverty or 
at best to a low material sufficiency is mounting. 
  The extremely difficult situation with real monetary incomes 
is partially alleviated by in-kind incomes and free services. At 
the present stage of the reforms, incomes are growing as a 
result of people holding more than one job or working private 
plots, as well as engaging in individual activity. From 1985 to 
1992, gross output from private plots increased in comparable 
1983 prices by a factor of 1.4, and their proportionate share in 
gross output for all of Russia's agricultural output for the 
same period increased by 23-33 percent. 
  For the most part, free state services for health care, 
education, and housing have been maintained. Taking into 
consideration both the fact that the population obtains some of 
its goods as a hedge against future higher prices, and 
nonmonetary income, real income for the population as a whole in 
recent years declined from R138 per capita per month in 1991 on 
average by a factor of about 1.5, a decline that affected 
primarily the less well-off part of the population. 
  The decline in real income has been expressed in the fact 
that in 1992 the population began to consume the most important 
food products and to buy nonfood goods to a significantly lesser 
extent than in 1990: consumption of meat and meat products fell 
from 68 kg to 58 kg per year; meat and dairy products from 386 
kg to 295 kg; eggs from 296 to 256; sugar from 47.2 kg to 33.6 
kg; vegetable oil from 10.0 kg to 6.5 kg; vegetables, melons, 
and gourds from 89 kg to 83 kg; and fruits and berries from 35 
kg to 33 kg. Only the consumption of potatoes and grain products 
rose slightly, reaching 119 kg and 122 kg per capita per year, 
respectively. Fabric consumption for this period fell from 39.14 
to 22.0 square meters, and shoes from 3.27 to 2.16 pairs per 
capita per year. 
  At the present time, what is advancing ever more sharply to 
the fore is the task of studying the influence of the transition 
to a market economy on the standard of living in the various 
territory-subjects of the Russian Federation and the 
possibilities of comparing individual regions for standard of 
living achieved and its dynamic. In order to address this task, 
the VTsUZh is monitoring incomes and consumption for the regions 
of the RF. 
  The dynamic of real incomes and personal consumption differs 
substantially for individual regions. These indicators are 
dropping most quickly in the Severo-Kavkazskiy and Tsentralnyi 
and Severo-Zapadnyi regions. Matters are slightly better in the 
Tsentralno-Chernozemnyy and Povolzhskiy regions, where the level 
of self-provision of consumer goods has always been relatively 
high, as well as in the Uralskiy and Volgo-Vyatskiy regions, 
that is, the regions where defense complex branches are 
concentrated and where the level of consumption is being 
supported by the state at the present time. 
  The Tsentralnyy region has ceded first place for level of 
per 
capita consumption to the Dalnevostochnyy region. The average 
Russian level of per capita consumption for the Povolzhskiy and 
Severnyy regions has begun to rise tangibly. Meanwhile, the 
Zapadno-Sibirskiy and Vostochno-Sibirskiy regions, where 
previously the per capita consumption corresponded more or less 
to the average Russian level, have begun to lag behind it. 
  We think that the subjects of the Russian Federation as well 
as the central economic organs would be interested in obtaining 
and utilizing this information in order to develop and fine-tune 
their own measures for implementing the social policy being 
carried out on the territorial level. 
  To assess citizens' standard of living, the concept of a 
"minimum consumption budget" (MPB) is used. The MPB is 
calculated to provide for the full satisfaction of a person's 
reasonable requirements. The BPM (minimum subsistence budget) 
ensures the basic conditions for life at this stage in society's 
development so as to maintain both people's ability to work and 
their health. 
  The BPM envisages average per capita consumption as follows: 
grain products 130.8 kg per year; potatoes 124.2; vegetables 
94.0; fruits and berries 19.4; sugar 20.7, meat products 26.6, 
fish products 11.7; dairy products 212.4; vegetable oil and 
margarine 10 kg per year; and 151 eggs. The food basket used in 
calculating the subsistence minimum was developed by specialists 
at the Nutrition Institute of the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences. In accordance with their recommendations, the daily 
caloric value of foods included in the BPM comprises at least 
2720.4 calories for working-age men, 2138.4 calories for 
working-age women, 1976.6 calories for pensioners, 1581.6 
calories for children under 6 years of age, and 2385.6 calories 
for youths ages 7-15, or 2236.7 calories on average. The food 
basket underwent expert analysis in the World Health 
Organization and received a positive evaluation. The structure 
of the BPM includes, apart from expenditures for food, 
expenditures for nonfood goods, services, taxes, and other 
mandatory outlays. 
  The minimum subsistence level varies according to regional 
characteristics in its monetary expression as well. Thus, its 
highest amount was in the Dalnevostochnyy region (R58,237 in 
October 1993), in Khanta-Mansiyskiy Autonomous Okrug (R87,244), 
and in Amurskaya Oblast (R69,126); its lowest was in the 
Tsentralno-Chernozemnyy regions of Russia (R18,864), the 
Republic of Tatarstan (R15,815), the Republic of Karelia 
(R10,970), and Rostovskaya Oblast (R17,123). 
  If we compare conditions of current minimum-level 
consumption 
in October and with July, we discover the following tendencies. 
The minimum cost of life declined in comparison with the average 
Russian level in the Severo-Zapadnyy, Volgo-Vyatskiy, 
Tsentralno-Chernozemnyy, Povolzhskiy, and Uralskiy regions. It 
increased, and quite noticeably, in the Vostochno-Sibirskiy, 
Zapadno-Sibirskiy, and Dalnevostochnyy regions. In the remaining 
areas the correlation between the monetary assessment of minimum 
requirements and the average Russian level remained virtually 
unchanged. 
  Contemporary reforms have significantly intensified the 
differentiation in the population by level of income and 
consumption. Usually for these indicators the 10 percent 
worst-off and best-off portions of the population are compared. 
According to data from budgetary research, in October 1993, the 
average level of monetary per capita income among the 10 percent 
best-off exceeded the corresponding level among the 10 percent 
worst-off by a factor of 6. Within a year, the degree of 
differentiation had nearly doubled. In October 1993, the share 
of income among the 10 percent best-off in the total income fund 
comprised 19.3 percent, whereas the share of the 10 percent 
worst-off in the total income fund comprised 3.2 percent. 
  The data cited above must be evaluated critically, since 
budgetary statistics do not reflect sufficiently fully all 
strata of the population. The most well-provided, rich families 
get left out and thus the proportion of poor in the total 
numbers is greatly exaggerated. 
  The VTsUZh differentiates the population by level of income 
and consumption in relation to consumption budgets. It has 
distinguished five population groups with various levels of 
material provision: 
  --group I are the "poor" families, whose per capita income 
is 
less than or equal to the cost assessment of the minimum 
subsistence budget; 
  --group II are the "low-income" families, whose per capita 
income falls between the cost assessment of the minimum 
subsistence budget and the cost assessment of the minimum 
consumption budget; 
  --group III are the "middle-income" families, whose per 
capita income falls between the cost assessment of one and two 
MPBs (or varies around the average budget); 
  --group IV are the "well-off" families, whose per capita 
income falls between double the MPB (or the average budget) and 
the per capita income level (or reasonable consumption budget) 
that conventionally characterizes "rich" families; and 
  --group V are the "rich" families, whose per capita income 
is 
higher than the income conventionally characterizing "rich" 
families (or the reasonable consumption budget) and is defined 
by differentiated budgets (as of July 1993 this was accepted as 
being over R150,000 per family member). 
  According to data from selective research, in July of this 
year, poor families made up 32 percent of the population, 
low-income 41 percent, middle-income 20 percent, well-off 5.5 
percent, and 1.5 percent of the population lived in rich 
families. Special research indicates that the breaking down into 
extreme groups for per capita income levels is mounting at an 
increasing rate. In 1993, the incomes of "rich" families (group 
V) exceeded the per capita incomes of poor families (group I) by 
a factor of as much as 30. 
  In world practice, the proportion of income used for food in 
the family budget is used as a general indicator for standard of 
living: the lower this proportion, the higher the standard of 
living. Selective research by the VTsUZh indicates that in the 
middle of this year for the 14 percent worst-off in the 
population, the share of expenditures for food in the budgets of 
their families was over 83.1 percent, for 31 percent 67.1-81.3 
percent, for 34 percent 44.1-67.0 percent, and for 14 percent 
23.0-44.0 percent. For the 8 percent best-off, the proportionate 
weight of expenses for food in families' budgets came to less 
than 23 percent. 
  As analysis indicates, the poor include the greatest degree 
of broken families. Families with many children find themselves 
in the most difficult material position, up to 60 percent of 
them being concentrated in group I. Refugees and migrants, up to 
three quarters of whom fall into the category of poor families, 
are in an especially difficult situation. 
  The level of family income rises in direct proportion to how 
much of that income is in the form of wages. The highest level 
and proportionate weight of wages in rich families is determined 
by additional employment. In these families, income from 
cooperative enterprises and from other labor activity comprises 
up to 30 percent of all sources of income, or about 30 times 
more than the corresponding income in poor families. Poor 
families are characterized by a higher proportion of income in 
the form of pensions, subsidies, and stipends. The proportionate 
weight of these incomes nonetheless declined in poor families by 
comparison with the initial period of reform in 1992. 
  Among the poor able-bodied population, the proportionate 
weight of those working in state and municipal enterprises is 
approximately twice as high. At the same time, up to 40 percent 
of all those working from the rich income group work in 
individual (family) and private enterprises, while among the 
poor able-bodied population this indicator is 20 times or more 
lower. Among the rich, income from shares and other forms of 
property (other than private plots) reaches up to 10 percent of 
the total volume of income, while among the poor this income 
does not exceed 1.5 percent. As income rises, the commercial 
orientation of the private plot is increasingly manifested. If 
in poor families the overwhelming mass of output is used for 
personal consumption, in well-off and rich families up to 50 
percent of all net output from private plots is sold. 
  Poor families have been most affected by unemployment. 
Analysis indicates that up to half of those individuals who are 
able-bodied and who receive an unemployment subsidy are 
concentrated in poor families. 
  Among poor families, the proportionate weight of the 
non-able-bodied is significantly higher than among rich 
families. According to VTsUZh assessments, at present more than 
two-fifths of the members of poor families are children or 
individuals older than working age. In rich families these 
social-demographic groups comprise about one-sixth. In several 
regions up to 40 percent and more of all children live in poor 
families. Among the dependents in these families, mothers 
raising young children are represented significantly more often 
than in others. 
  In social programs to support the standard of living, it 
obviously makes sense to separate out the following blocs: 
  --measures to provide guarantees to all population groups 
and 
strata (minimum social norms: salaries, pensions, stipends, 
other social payments, taking into consideration socioeconomic 
conditions in the regions; ecological conditions of survival, 
safety, and others); 
  --measures for the social support of the able-bodied 
population (above all, the creation of conditions for the 
independent resolution of the problem of raising their families' 
standard of living); 
  --measures for targeted social protection of the 
non-able-bodied population, measures to protect citizens who 
find themselves in difficult life situations, and marginal 
population groups; as well as resource, information, and 
organizational provision for the program. 
  Such a structure for this type of social program makes it 
possible to isolate the most severe social problems, to lend a 
systematic nature to all envisaged measures, and to take into 
account specific local features. 
  As a result, we can expect an increase in the efficiency of 
social policy and the approach of a turning point for 
inauspicious tendencies in the socioeconomic status of Russia's 
population.

<F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Economic Sciences Aleksandr Frenkel, </F>
under the "A Forecast" rubric: "Russian Industry in February"] 
  [Text] Since the beginning of 1994, the situation in 
industry has worsened sharply. According to the current data, it 
looks as if the decline of production in January will be more 
substantial than had been presented in our January forecast. 
  There will be 20 work days in February 1994--the same number 
that there was in February 1993. A sharp decline in production 
will continue in an absolute majority of industrial sectors in 
all regions of Russia. Output of more than 85 percent of 
varieties of products produced will decline. The output will 
decline by more than 20 percent in most machine-building 
sectors, the chemical industry, a number of sectors in the 
construction materials industry, production of home appliances, 
and the light industry. 
  The value of the physical volume index of the output will 
measure in February in Russia as whole at 0.802 (in December it 
was to 0.839 as compared to the forecasted value of 0.854--see 
DELOVOY MIR, 10 December 1993), that is, production will decline 
by 19.8 percent. The average daily output of industrial 
production will decline in February also by 19.8 percent as 
compared to 1993. (In December, the average daily output 
declined by 14.1 percent as compared to the forecasted value of 
14.6 percent--see DELOVOY MIR, 10 December 1993). 
  The financial situation of most enterprises is unstable. To 
a 
large extent, this is associated with the exacerbating solvency 
crisis. According to the Russian Goskomstat [State Committee for 
Statistics] data, as of 1 December past due payments owed to 
suppliers by consumer enterprises amounted to 8.304 trillion 
rubles [R] and increased over the month by 30.3 percent. Past 
due indebtedness will continue to increase in February. 
  The situation in the fuel and power generation complex 
sectors in February will change only insignificantly as compared 
to the preceding winter months. Production of oil will decline 
over the month by 3 million tonnes (11 percent) and will amount 
to 26.8 million tonnes. Oil production in Tyumen Oblast, which 
accounts for two-thirds of all oil production in Russia, will 
decline in approximately the same proportion. The drop in the 
output results in cutbacks in primary processing of oil, which 
will reach 10 percent in February. This in turn will cause a 
decline in the production of automotive gasoline by 9 percent, 
diesel fuel by 12 percent, and boiler oil by 9 percent. Gas 
production will decline somewhat in February--by 1 percent (0.5 
billion cubic meters). The decline in production is the result 
of the difficult economic situation in the industry and the 
strained circumstances of consumers of its output. The problem 
is that the current level of production lately on the whole 
corresponded to domestic needs in gas. At the same time, 
consumers' insolvency in near-abroad countries results in 
cutbacks of its deliveries there and, as a consequence, cutbacks 
in production. 
  Electric power generation at public utilities will decline 
over February by 2.6 billion kWt/hr (3 percent), which will be 
brought about mainly by a decline in power generation at heat 
and power plants (by 4 percent) and hydroelectric stations (also 
by 4 percent). Production decline in power engineering results 
to a large extent from disruption in fuel deliveries (especially 
coal), as well as cutbacks in deliveries of electric power to 
consumers with whom the utilities have outstanding unpaid bills 
for many months. The structure of fuel consumption by heat and 
power plants in the beginning of 1993 was as follows. The share 
of gas in all fuels used equals 64 percent, coal--24 percent, 
and petroleum products--12 percent. 
  Production of coal in February as a whole will drop off by 
1.2 million tonnes (4 percent), including coal for coking--by 2 
percent. A number of mines have declared a prestrike condition. 
Many of them are delaying shipments of coal to consumers because 
of considerable past due payments to coal producers. 
  In ferrous metallurgy, the decline in operations of iron ore 
enterprises continues to accelerate. In February iron ore mining 
will drop by 8 percent as compared to last year. Deliveries of 
scrap metal, whose collection will fall off by almost 40 
percent, also will diminish. The result will be that the 
proportion of more expensive pig iron used in steel smelting 
will increase and that the less expensive scrap metal will 
decrease. These negative processes will take place against the 
background of a declining supply of fuel to the industry: Coke 
burning will decrease over the month by 9 percent. In addition 
to an insufficient supply of raw materials to the industry, its 
development is substantially affected by a problem common for 
the entire of industrial production--considerable insolvency on 
the part of consumers. As of 1 December 1993, past due arrears 
on the part of buyers for the products shipped by metallurgical 
enterprises amounted to R1.547 trillion. All of this is 
seriously undermining ferrous metallurgy, which is already in a 
critical condition even without this. As a result, the output of 
pig iron in February will decline by 18 percent, steel 
smelting--by 24 percent, and that of finished rolled metal--by 
23 percent. There is a continuing decline in the production of 
steel pipe, which will reach 50 percent in February. To a 
considerable extent this is related to the declining demand for 
the sector's output. The situation in machine building continues 
to worsen dramatically. The output of more than 85 percent of 
categories of products counted in periodic reports will decline 
in February. With respect to a considerable share of items, the 
output will decline by 30 or more percent. Among them are 
forge-press machines, whose output will drop off by 73 percent; 
metal-cutting machine tools--by 49 percent; bulldozers--by 50 
percent; and excavators--by 30 percent. 
  The situation in transportation machine building will worsen 
substantially. The output of diesel locomotives will fall off by 
50 percent, electric locomotives--by 90 percent, railroad cargo 
cars--by 30 percent, railroad passenger cars--by 20 percent, and 
trolleys--by 33 percent. 
  Production of agricultural machinery also will continue to 
decline: The output of tractors will drop off by 90 percent, 
tractor hitches--by 93 percent, and grain harvesting 
combines--by 67 percent. 
  While the volume of production in automotive machine 
building 
had been increasing until recently, in February the picture will 
change. The output of trucks will decline by 47 percent, 
passenger automobiles--by 17 percent, and buses--by 5 percent. 
  The output of equipment for light industry also will 
decline: 
production of spinning machines will decline by 11 percent, and 
weaving looms--by 20 percent. Production of ball bearings will 
drop off by 45 percent. 
  The situation in the chemical industry will worsen in 
February. A considerable decline in production will take place 
first and foremost with respect to the output of the sector's 
raw materials. For instance, the output of synthetic ammonia 
will decline by 17 percent, sulphuric acid--by 31 percent, soda 
ash--by 40 percent, and caustic soda--by 19 percent. 
  The decline in production of mineral fertilizer will 
exacerbate considerably. In February it will reach 32 percent. 
This is related first and foremost to the shortage of 
mineral-chemical raw materials, which has developed as a result 
of depletion of mineral reserves, as well as the lack of modern 
equipment and technologies for more complete extraction of 
minerals used in production of mineral fertilizer. As a result, 
the structure of mineral fertilizer production has changed. In 
1993 the share of nitrogen fertilizer amounted to 52 percent, 
while the proportional share of a more effective phosphorus 
fertilizer, whose production is more labor-intensive, amounted 
to only 24 percent. The share of potassium fertilizer also 
amounted to 24 percent. Second, the exacerbating insolvency 
crisis put the sector's enterprises in an extremely difficult 
financial situation. As a result, serious difficulties arise 
with respect to purchases of raw materials and components, which 
leads in turn to lesser utilization of capacities. Even more 
considerable will be the decline in production of 
microbiological feed protein--by 41 percent; production of 
chemical fiber and filament will drop off by 32 percent. 
  In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry in 
February the decline in production will increase as compared to 
the preceding winter months. This is associated first and 
foremost with a disruption in the operations of the 
timber-logging sector, which serves as a base for 
timber-processing productions. For instance, the outtake of 
round timber declined over the month by 22 percent, which will 
be the main factor in the expected 38 percent decline in the 
production of commercial timber. The technical base of the 
sector is extremely backward. The equipment is extremely 
obsolete, while the financing for accumulation of 
between-seasons reserves of timber are allocated belatedly and 
in insufficient volume. The sharp increase in railroad tariffs 
creates difficulties in transporting timber from Siberia and the 
Far East to the European part of Russia, where the greatest 
number of timber-processing enterprises are located. The limited 
supply of timber material to enterprises will lead, in turn, to 
a decline in the output of lumber by 29 percent, plywood 
laminate--by 22 percent, and wood particleboard--by 8 percent. 
Serious deficiencies in deliveries of wood materials and the 
extremely poor technical condition of equipment are the main 
causes of the declining output of paper and cardboard, which 
will fall in February by 21 percent and 30 percent, respectively. 
  In the construction materials industry, the decline slowed 
down somewhat in the fourth quarter of 1993, which was caused by 
a pick-up in housing construction (individual, as well as 
construction done by joint-stock companies and other nonstate 
organizations). However, at the beginning of 1994 this trend 
will change. Production of cement will decline in February by 12 
percent, of asbestos-cement sheeting by 62 percent, 
asbestos-cement pipe and couplers by 43 percent, construction 
brick by 8 percent, prefabricated ferroconcrete by 14 percent, 
soft roofing materials by 30 percent, and window glass by 34 
percent. 
  In the beginning of 1994, the trend toward a decline in the 
production of most varieties of complex home appliances, which 
emerged in the fourth quarter of 1993, has settled in. Only the 
output of refrigerators and freezers will increase by 2 percent 
in February of 1994. Production of most other categories of 
complex home appliances will be declining: washing machines by 
45 percent, electric vacuum cleaners by 55 percent, tape 
recorders by 40 percent, radio receivers by 36 percent, 
television sets by 23 percent, sewing machines by 66 percent, 
and bicycles by 66 percent. The reasons, which have already 
become habitual for many industrial sectors, are the shortage of 
material and financial resources and the declining demand 
because of a substantial increase in prices. The output of 
synthetic detergents will drop off by 37 percent. 
  In light industry in February, as during the preceding 
months, the output of cotton fabrics will be increasing and will 
reach 222 million square meters (133 percent). Production of 
other most important categories of the industry's output, 
however, will be falling: woolen fabrics by 42 percent, silk 
fabrics by 40 percent, knitwear by 28 percent, hosiery by 26 
percent, and footwear by 51 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Weekly Prices for 15-22 February"] </F>
  [Text] From the 15th through the 22d of February, the 
inflation level amounted to 1.9 percent and this is the lowest 
weekly value in the current year. Over the past week, the 
increase in prices for nonfood goods was equal to 2.4 percent. 
Foodstuffs and paid public services became more expensive over 
the week by 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. 
  The difference in the price increase rates for basic 
consumer 
goods and paid public services for Russia's individual economic 
regions was insignificant. 
  In Moscow and St. Petersburg, the increase in prices for 
goods and services was higher than the national average increase 
and amounted respectively to 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent. In 
Moscow, the prices for nonfood goods increased most of all -- by 
3.1 percent, while, in St. Petersburg, paid public services 
became more expensive by 4.5 percent. 
<H5>  Only Vodka Is Becoming Cheaper </H5>
  Basic food products over the past week became more expensive 
by 1.6 percent. Prices rose most of all for vegetables -- by 4.4 
percent, for groats and pasta items -- by 3.5 percent and for 
dairy products -- by 3.4 percent. The prices for vegetable oil 
and sugar hardly changed at all. 
  Over the week, vodka became cheaper on the average by 1 
percent. 
  At the municipal and unofficial markets, the prices for meat 
and fish products, butter, eggs, sugar, flour, and salt remained 
unchanged.

  Somewhat higher than in the preceding week was the 
difference 
in the rate of increase in prices for foodstuffs for Russia's 
individual economic regions. Food products became more expensive 
in the Northern Caucasus region than anywhere else. Here, 
vegetables and fruits were 10 percent higher than a week ago, 
butter was 5 percent higher and dairy products, pasta items and 
some types of canned goods were 3-4 percent higher. 
  Prices for foodstuffs in the Eastern Siberian region 
remained 
practically unchanged in comparison with the preceding week. 
  The average cost of a basket of the 19 most important food 
products on 22 February amounted to 40,500 rubles [R] calculated 
on a monthly basis and rose over the week by 1.6 percent and, 
since the beginning of the year, by 32.8 percent. The cost of 
this basket, based on organized trade prices, was equal to 
R39,200 and, based on unorganized trade prices, to R54,300.

    The disparity between the maximum and minimum costs for a 
basket in different Russian cities amounted to a factor of 3.4 
(in the previous week, it was a factor of 3.9).

  The greatest increase in the cost of a basket, just like a 
week ago, was noted in the Northern Caucasus region -- 4.4 
percent. 
  The most "inexpensive" region in basket cost in the past 
week 
was the Central Chernozem region -- R21,600, while the most 
"costly" was, as before, the Far East region (R70,200). 
  Among the surveyed Russian cities, a substantial increase in 
the cost of a basket was noted in the cities of Tatarstan 
(Kazan, Chistopol and Naberezhnyye Chelny), where, over the 
week, milk and sour cream became more expensive by a factor of 
1.4-1.6, while rye-wheat bread, wheat bread from grade I and II 
flour and potatoes increased by a factor of 1.3-1.4. 
  The cost of a basket of the 19 most important food products 
in Moscow and St. Petersburg amounted to R45,300 and R41,800 and 
increased over the week by 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, 
respectively. On the list of surveyed cities, Moscow, just like 
a week ago, occupied the 30th position, while St. Petersburg 
moved from the 49th position to the 51st position. 
<H5>  Fabrics, Powders and Wallpaper Are Becoming More Expensive </H5>
  Nonfood products became more expensive by 2.4 percent. Over 
the past week, just as over the 2 preceding weeks, the greatest 
price increases were for fuel -- by 9 percent, and for medicine 
-- by 8 percent. Fabrics, synthetic detergents and wallpaper 
became 4-5 percent more expensive over the week. The prices for 
footwear changed less than those for other nonfood products 
(just like a week ago -- by 1 percent). 
  The increase in prices for non-food products amounted in 
nearly all economic regions to 2-3 percent. And only for the 
inhabitants of the Eastern Siberian region, where fabrics, fuel 
and medicine became 12-15 percent more expensive, did they 
increase overall by 4 percent. 
  The disparity between the minimum and maximum price levels 
for individual goods is not shrinking. So, for example, in the 
surveyed Russian cities, the differences in the cost of footwear 
in February amounted to a factor of 6-8. Whereas one pair of 
men's good-quality shoes cost R11,000-14,000 in Novocheboksarsk, 
Cheboksary and Shebekino at the end of February, their price 
exceeded R90,000 in Groznyy.

<H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services in the Consumer Market </H5>
  Over the period 25 to 31 January 1994 prices for consumer 
goods and services rose by 2.4 percent, including those for 
foodstuffs by 2.4 percent, nonfood items--by 2.3 percent, and 
paid services--by 3.2 percent. 
  The dynamics of price indices for consumer goods and 
services 
in January were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding

  In the fuel industry prices for the main 
categories of energy resources rose in January on average by 24 
percent, which was more than twice the average monthly rate of 
increase in this industry in the fourth quarter of 1993. 
  Average prices for coal and oil in Russia increased over the 
month by 20 percent and amounted, respectively, to R12,000 and 
R39,000 per tonne; for gas they increased by a factor of 1.5 
(R2,600 per thousand cubic meters). Oil refining enterprises 
raised prices for their products on average by 26 percent. The 
wholesale price of gasoline at the end of January was R129,000, 
diesel fuel--R119,000, and fuel oil--R41,000 per tonne. 
  Because of rising coal and gas prices, electric power rates 
in January went up by 22 percent as compared to prices in effect 
in the fourth quarter of 1993 and amounted by the end of January 
on average for all categories of consumers to R20.2 per kw-hour. 
The greatest rate increases took place with respect to electric 
power supplied to electricity-powered transport, municipal 
services, and other nonindustrial consumers. In some regions 
power rates per kw-hour increased more significantly (by a 
factor of 1.4-1.5). Among them are Perm, Orel, and Tula Oblasts, 
Chuvash Republic, and some others. 
  In the chemical industry prices, after slowing 
down somewhat in the forth quarter of 1993 (to a level of 13 
percent a month on average), took off again in January, 
increasing by almost one-quarter, and with respect to some 
categories of products (nitrogen, phosphate, and combination 
fertilizer, hydrochloric acid, soda ash, synthetic dyes, 
detergents, and some others)--by more than half. 
  In machine building the greatest price increases 
were registered at enterprises in railroad, chemical, petroleum, 
road construction, and municipal services machine building, and 
in the electrotechnical industry, where prices in January rose 
on average by 122-128 percent as compared to 115-199 percent a 
month in the fourth quarter of 1993. 
  Because of diminished demand for domestically produced goods 
and increased competition from imported goods, prices for light 
industry goods and household and cultural goods rose at a slower 
rate than in the past. The average rate of prices increases in 
light industry dropped in 1993 from 45 percent in 
January to 8 percent in December; in January 1994 these prices 
rose by 12 percent, including by 5 percent in leather, fur, and 
footwear industry; by 8 percent in the garment industry; and by 
10 percent in knitwear industry. Prices for household and 
cultural goods in January increased on average by 10 percent, 
and for furniture--by 18 percent. 
  In the food processing industry in January prices 
for butter and oil, cheese-making, and dairy industry products 
increased by more than one-quarter; in the bread-baking 
industry--by 18 percent, and in the meat-processing industry--by 
14 percent. Fish industry enterprise raised prices for their 
output in January by 20 percent as compared to December. 
<H5>  Results of Industry Operations </H5>
  In January of this year Russian industry produced more than 
R15 trillion worth of output in current prices. The physical 
volume of production fell by 23.1 percent as compared to January 
1993. As compared to the level of December 1993 the total output 
fell by 17.2 percent, and the average daily output--by 11 
percent. 
  Production in the fuel and power generation industries and 
nonferrous metallurgy declined by 5-9 percent as compared to 
January 1993. In most processing industries the scale of decline 
was considerably greater. In the light and food processing 
industries production declined by 19-28 percent. In the sectors 
producing producer goods the scale of decline ranged from 23 
percent in ferrous metallurgy to 28-35 percent in the 
construction materials, chemical and petrochemical, timber, 
woodworking, and pulp and paper industries, and 52 percent in 
machine building.

<H3>  Distribution of Population of Russia by Size of Per Capita 
Monetary Income and Size of Subsistence Minimum </H3>
  By the end of 1993 differentiation with respect to family 
income continued to grow. The income of the population in the 
top 10 percent bracket exceeded almost by a factor of 11 the 
income of the same share of the lowest-income population, while 
at the end of 1992 this value was measured by the factor of 7.5 
to eight. The index of income concentration (the Gini 
coefficient) increased in January 1994 to 0.352; at the end of 
1993 it measured at 0.346, and in 1992--0.327.

  In January 1994 (according to estimates) 20 percent of the 
high-income population accounted for 42 percent of total 
monetary income, while the low-income 20 percent accounted for 
only 7 percent. 
  The average per capita value of the subsistence minimum 
(according to the methodology of the Russian Ministry of Labor 
approved in November 1992)--in January 1994 prices--was 
calculated to be R51,400, including R58,000 for a work-eligible 
person, R36,200 for a pensioner, and R51,300 for a child. The 
cost of the consumer food basket (19 products) amounts to 68 
percent of the minimum subsistence value. 
  The income of a considerable part of the population does not 
cover even the cost of the consumer food basket factored in the 
calculation of the subsistence minimum, as may be seen from the 
following data.

  The subsistence minimum value varies greatly across Russian 
regions: from R18,000-30,000 in Ulyanovsk Oblast, Republic of 
Tatarstan, and Kursk, Tula, Orel, Smolensk, Voronezh, and Penza 
Oblasts to R73,000-97,000 in Moscow, Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk 
Kray, and Republic of Sakha and R117,000-119,000 in Sakhalin and 
Magadan Oblasts. 
<H3>  Construction of Processing Sectors Facilities in the 
Agro-Industrial Complex </H3>
  In 1993, R659 billion from all sources of financing, or 16 
percent of all capital investment in the APK [agro-industrial 
complex], was used for development of the material and technical 
base of the complex's processing sectors. As compared to 1992, 
this investment decreased by almost one-quarter. 
  The 1993 targets for putting into operation capacities for 
processing and storing agricultural output were met only to a 
small extent, as may be seen from the following data.

  Over the past year no capacities were put into operation for 
production of processed cheese, fish processing, or elevators 
and cereal-making enterprises. 
  In 1993 construction of 355 facilities was envisaged with 
federal budget financing in accordance with targeted federal 
programs for development of the baby food industry, "Sugar," 
"Bread for Russia," "Vegetable Oil," and "Fish;" 122 of them 
were supposed to be put into operation in 1993. Actually, only 
nine facilities were put in operation over January-December of 
last year. Construction of 46 facilities has not yet began. 
  Of the enterprises that were supposed to be put into 
operation in 1993 but were not, 10 were in the program for 
development of the baby food industry, 11 in the "Sugar" 
program, two in "Vegetable Oil" program, 57 in "Fish" program, 
and 34--in "Bread for Russia." 
  Among those not put into operation were capacities at dairy 
combines in Novocheboksarsk in Chuvash Republic, Krasnodar, and 
St. Petersburg; at the sugar factories Bolshevik in Belgorod 
Oblast and Meleuz in the Republic of Bashkortostan; at oil 
extraction plants in Millerovo in Rostov Oblast and Georgiyevsk 
in Stavropol Kray; at the fish combine in Ivanovo and 
fish-breeding farm Zheleznogorskiy in Kursk Oblast; an elevator 
in Dimitrovograd in Ulyanovsk Oblast; a cereal production 
department at a bread-baking combine in Tolyatti in Samara 
Oblast, and others. 
<H5>  Construction of Nursing Homes </H5>
  As of 1 January 1993, 5,500 persons in the Russian 
Federation 
were on waiting lists for placement in a nursing home for the 
elderly and disabled. Over 1993 enterprises and organizations of 
all forms of ownership put into operation such facilities for 
3,400 accommodations (including boarding homes for labor 
veterans), which comprises 113 percent of the 1992 level. 
  Of 87 facilities envisaged to be put into operation over 
January-December, only 48 were completed. 
  A dismal situation with respect to construction of nursing 
homes is developing on the territory of the Northern Economic 
Region, where 1,389 persons are on waiting lists for placement. 
Of the five territories in this region, only the Komi Republic 
put into operation a 240-bed nursing home. 
  Construction of these facilities frequently exceeds the 
normative time frame. The opening date for a 170-bed nursing 
home for elderly and disabled in Yoshkar-Ola in Mari El Republic 
and a 110-bed home in Vladimir in Irkutsk Oblast has already 
been postponed for two years. The sleeping quarters in the 
120-bed nursing home for elderly and disabled at Mukhinskaya 
station in Amur Oblast have been under construction since 1990. 
  Among those not ready to open in 1993 were a 100-bed nursing 
home for the elderly in Verkhoshizhemye settlement in Kirov 
Oblast, a boarding home for retarded children for 300 
accommodations in Shemordan settlement in the Republic of 
Tatarstan, and a 315-bed nursing home for elderly and disabled 
in Tolyatti in Samara Oblast. 
<H5>  Capital Repairs of the Housing Stock </H5>
  Eleven percent of the state-owned housing stock in the 
Russian Federation is currently in need of immediate repairs. 
Because of the shortage of financing, repairs are done annually 
on no more than 1.5 percent of the housing stock. 
  In 1993, R842 billion was spent on housing repairs. The cost 
of repairs on one square meter of living area amounted on 
average to R37,000, including R60,000 in municipal property 
buildings, and R19,000 in buildings assigned to organizations 
and enterprises. 



                           Total living area of housing that      As % of 1992 
                         underwent capital repairs in 
                         1993--million square meters

  The volume of capital repairs of housing increased 1.5-fold 
or more in 1993 as compared to 1992 in the Republic of Tatarstan 
and Altay Republic, Maritime and Krasnodar Krays, and Leningrad, 
Vladimir, Tula, Voronezh, Kaliningrad, Tyumen, and Rostov 
Oblasts. At the same time, in the Republics of Komi and 
Dagestan, Krasnoyarsk Kray, Arkhangelsk, Kirov, Saratov, Amur, 
and Kamchatka Oblasts, and Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast the 
volume of repair work decreased over this period by 40-50 
percent. 
  Despite existing five-year targets, not a single kilometer 
of 
the gas distribution system was built at economic entities in 
Irkutsk and Sakhalin Oblasts and Komi Republic or withdrawal 
branches in gas pipelines on the territories of Russia's 17 
constituent republics, krays, and oblasts, including Komi and 
Sakha (Yakutia) Republic, Kemerovo, Kirov, and Tambov Oblasts, 
and Altay Kray.

  The cost of this selection is used to compare the level of 
prices for foodstuffs in different cities. The selection 
consists of 19 basic foodstuffs and is calculated on the basis 
of consumption norms needed for a male of work-eligible age. 
This selection (consumption volumes are indicated on a per-year 
basis) includes: rye bread (92 kg), wheat bread (86.7 kg), 
millet (18.1 kg), vermicelli (7.3 kg), sugar (24.8 kg), 
vegetable oil (10 kg), butter (3.6 kg), beef (42.0 kg), boiled 
sausage (2.2 kg), salami (1.1 kg), milk (184.3 kg), sour cream 
(4.2 kg), hard cheese (2.0 kg), eggs (183), potatoes (146 kg), 
fresh cabbage (29.8 kg), onion (10.2 kg), apples (11 kg), and 
cigarettes (96 packs). 
  This listing was chosen by virtue of the relative stability 
seen in availability of these products for sale, enabling a 
well-founded analysis to be made of the cost dynamics of product 
selection. 
  Only those cities were taken into consideration where not 
more than three items from the listing were absent during the 
given or preceding price registration. 
  The value of the selection of basic foodstuffs shown is on a 
per-week basis.

<H5>  Prices for Goods and Services </H5>
  Over the period 1-8 February 1994 prices for consumer 
goods and services rose by 3.3 percent, including those for 
foodstuffs--by 3.8 percent, nonfood items--by 2.8 percent, and 
for-fee services for the population--by 3.1 percent. 
  Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in 
January-February were as follows (as a percentage of the 
preceding date): 



                  01/25      01/31      02/08      Average daily price rise

  Prices in the consumer market continue to rise at a faster 
rate (4.4 percent) in the cities of the Far East. They rose the 
least (by 1.8 percent) since the beginning of the month in the 
cities in the Urals. 
<H5>  Foodstuffs </H5>
  From 1-8 February prices for basic foodstuffs rose by 3.9 
percent in organized trade, and by 3.5 percent in nonorganized 
trade. Price changes by main categories of food products over 
this period are shown below (in % of 31 January 1994):

  Prices with respect to milk products and bread and bakery 
products in organized trade continue to rise at a high rate. 
Over January--beginning of February prices for these products 
rose by 1 percent daily on average. Over the past week prices 
for meat products and vegetables rose by almost 3 percent; the 
rate of price increases with respect to eggs slowed down 
somewhat (by 2 percent). Prices for sugar, confectionery items, 
and tea also rose insignificantly (by 1-2 percent). 
  In nonorganized trade prices rose over this week on average 
at almost the same rate as in organized trade. Prices for milk, 
sour cream, beef, poultry meat, and vegetable products rose at a 
higher rate (5-13 percent). Prices for pork, butter, vegetable 
oil, eggs, and apples rose by no more than 2-3 percent. 
  The cost of a consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs rose 
over the week by 4.2 percent and amounted as of 1 February to 
39,100 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. Magadan 
remains the most expensive city (R94,900) and Ulyanovsk the 
least expensive (R22,200). The price differential between them 
measures a factor of 4.3. Moscow has moved from 35th to 29th 
place of 132 monitored cities (R43,800 on a monthly basis). 
<H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>
  In the beginning of February prices for these items 
continued 
to rise at a moderate pace. Prices for sewn items and knitwear, 
fabrics, tobacco items, and cultural and household goods 
increased by 2.0-3.8 percent. 
<H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>
  Prices rose over the week by 3.1 percent. For some types of 
consumer services, prices increased by 10-12 percent. The cost 
of basic residential telephone service increased two- to 
fourfold in 24 cities and amounted to R1,500-2,000 a month. 
<H5>  The Consumer Market </H5>
  The total volume of retail turnover and for-fee services (at 
officially counted enterprises) amounted to R6.6 trillion in 
January of this year and increased eightfold as compared to 
January of last year. In comparable prices, it declined by 6.6 
percent. 
  Retail turnover amounted to R5.9 trillion and 
increased 7.8-fold in current prices as compared to last 
January. The physical volume of goods sold decreased over this 
period by 2.9 percent, and as compared to December--by more than 
one-quarter. 
  The private sector share (including consumer cooperatives) 
of 
officially reporting enterprises accounts for 56 percent of the 
retail turnover (38 percent in January 1993); the state 
sector--for 37 percent (60 percent); and other nonstate forms of 
ownership--7 percent (2 percent). 
  There were R3.1 trillion worth of foodstuffs sold to the 
population in January of this year, which is eight times more 
than over the same month last year in current prices, and 7.8 
percent less in comparable prices. 
  In January 1994 the population purchased R2.8 trillion worth 
of nonfood items (a sevenfold increase in current prices, and a 
3.3 percent increase in comparable prices). 
  In January of this year R0.7 trillion worth of for-fee 
services were rendered to the population (at officially counted 
enterprises), which constitutes an 11-fold increase in current 
prices as compared to last January, and a 48-percent decline in 
comparable prices. 
  The share of household consumer services in the structure of 
for-fee services is declining. In rural areas over the past year 
the number of combination point-of-service facilities declined 
by 12 percent. Professionally equipped barber facilities 
remained in only one half of currently operating enterprises. 
Only one-third of these facilities still provide electronics and 
complex home appliances repair services; photo services--7 
percent; and shoe repair--10 percent. Mobile services in rural 
areas are being phased out. 
  Consumer goods and services sold to the population in 
January 
of this year through all sales channels amounted to about R13 
trillion[.sup]*[/], which exceeds that for last January by a 
factor of 8.5 in current prices, and by 1.3 percent in 
comparable prices. 
<H5>  Inventories of Goods </H5>
  As of 1 February of this year the value of current 
inventories of consumer goods in trade and industry of the 
Russian Federation amounted to R9.2 trillion (at officially 
reporting enterprises). As compared to 1 February of last year, 
their volume declined by 4 percent in comparable prices. About 
79 percent of inventories (R7.2 trillion worth) are concentrated 
at retail trade enterprises. 
  Below are data characterizing turnover sufficiency level in 
terms of inventories of goods:

  As compared to January 1993, inventory sufficiency in 
January

margarine and margarine products, sugar, confectionery items, 
tea, salt, woolen fabrics, clothing and underwear, knitwear and 
hosiery, footwear, synthetic detergents, radio receivers, 
refrigerators, and tobacco items. 
<H5>  Market Saturation With Consumer Goods </H5>
  In January of this year saturation of all retail trade 
channels with consumer goods increased as compared to last 
January by 23 percent, and as compared to December by 4 percent. 
  Below are data characterizing the changes in the consumer 
market saturation by individual groups of goods (in percentages):

  As the consumer market develops and new channels for selling 
goods appear, part of the population is shifting from organized 
to nonorganized trade in regard to goods purchases. While 
purchases of meat products, sugar, and vegetable oil increased 
last year by 12-26 percent, and milk products--by 6 percent, 
their sales in organized trade dropped by 4-15 percent. 
<H5>  Monetary Income of the Population </H5>
  The monetary income earned by the population in January of 
this year amounted to R14.4 trillion and increased 9.7-fold as 
compared to January 1993; adjusted for the consumer price index, 
they increased by 7 percent. Disposable monetary income (income 
less compulsory payments) adjusted for the consumer price index 
increased over this period by 8 percent. The volume of nominal 
monetary income in January of this year was lower than in 
December of 1993 by 16.6 percent. This is typical for a number 
of years and stems from December payment of quarterly and yearly 
bonuses, as well as income in the form of interest paid on 
deposits at the end of the year. 
  The average wages due to workers in January of 
this year amounted to an estimated R145,000 and increased as 
compared to December 1993 by 3 percent (in December as compared 
to November it increased by 39 percent). As compared to last 
January the average wage increased 9.5-fold. 
  Stratification of the population by level of per capita 
monetary income continued to increase in January. The 
income concentration index (Gini coefficient) measured 0.352 in 
January 1994 as compared to 0.346 in December 1993 and 0.327 in 
1992. 
  The value of the subsistence minimum in January 
1994 amounted to R51,400 per capita, including R58,000 for 
work-eligible persons, R36,200 for pensioners, and R51,300 for 
children. The cost of the consumer food basket included in the 
subsistence minimum accounts for 68 percent of it. 
  Income of a considerable part of the population (mainly 
families with many children, incomplete families with children, 
families with a high proportion of dependents where working 
members' labor remuneration is close to the minimum, single 
pensioners, and the disabled) cannot cover even the cost of the 
consumer food basket taken into account in the calculation of 
the subsistence minimum, which may be seen from the following 
data:

  The value of the subsistence minimum differs substantially 
across the regions in Russia: from R18,000-30,000 in Ulyanovsk 
Oblast, the Republic of Tatarstan, and Kursk, Tula, Orel, 
Smolensk, Voronezh, and Penza Oblasts, to R73,000-97,000 in 
Moscow, Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk Kray, and the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia), and R117,000-119,000 in Sakhalin and Magadan Oblasts. 
<H5>  Industrial Production </H5>
  In January of this year Russian industry produced almost R16 
trillion worth of output in current prices. As compared to last 
January industrial production declined by 23.1 percent. As 
compared to December 1993 total output declined by 17.2 percent, 
and daily output--by 11 percent. 
  The fuel and power generation sectors in January 
of this year produced 89.5 billion kw-hrs of electric power (5 
percent less than in January 1993), 27.5 million tonnes of oil, 
including gas condensate (10 percent less), 25.3 million tonnes 
of coal (8 percent less), and 57.2 billion cubic meters of gas 
(the same level of production as January 1993). 
  There has been a considerable decline in the output of the 
main products of ferrous metallurgy. Steel smelting 
in January of this year amounted to 3.9 million tonnes (23 
percent below January 1993 level); pig iron production--3.0 
million tonnes (17 percent less); finished rolled metal--3.0 
million tonnes (20 percent less); and steel pipe--327,000 tonnes 
(47 percent less). 
  In January of this year, the output of half the monitored 
items in machine building amounted to 50 percent or 
less of last year. The output of large electric machinery 
amounted to 400 units (41 percent less than last January); of 
metal-cutting machine tools--1,800 (47 percent less); drop forge 
machines--295 (62 percent less); bulldozers--351 (46 percent 
less); trucks--16,500 (60 percent less); passenger cars--21,300 
(71 percent less); and tractors--2,100 (77 percent less). 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industry, 
because of resource limitations production of most varieties of 
output continued to fall in January. Overall, 660,000 tonnes of 
synthetic ammonia was produced over the month (a 27-percent 
decline as compared to the January 1993 level), 511,000 tonnes 
of sulfuric acid (35 percent), 135,000 tonnes of calcinated soda 
(47 percent), 107,000 tonnes of caustic soda (23 percent), 
547,000 tonnes of mineral fertilizer (26 percent), 18,300 tonnes 
of chemical thread and fiber (46 percent), and 1.8 million 
automotive tires (37 percent). 
  In the petrochemical industry, the output of synthetic 
spirits declined by 11 percent as compared to January 1993, 
technical hydrocarbon--by 42 percent, and synthetic rubber--by 
37 percent. A similar situation existed in the rubber-asbestos 
industry: production of rubberized-fabric and conveyer-type 
rubberized-cord belting, needed for repairs of agricultural 
machinery, declined by 37 percent and 17 percent, respectively, 
and that of metal-braid sleeves--by 68 percent. 
  In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper 
industry in January of this year the outshipment of timber 
amounted to 68 percent of last year's volume. Production of 
lumber amounted to 1.9 million tonnes (29 percent below that for 
January 1993), commercial cellulose--101,000 tonnes (30 percent 
below), and cardboard--87,700 tonnes (42 percent below). 
  The shortage of timber raw materials resulted in a decline 
in 
the production of laminated plywood and window and door frames 
by 21-26 percent; of mine props and shaft slab--by 34-58 
percent; and of preassembled homes made of wood--by 
three-quarters. 
  In the pulp and paper industry, as a result of difficulties 
in distribution of paper, whose price has risen numerous times, 
output declined by 18 percent as compared to the level of the 
corresponding month of last year. 
  In the construction materials industry in January, 
a further reduction in output was registered with respect to 
products used first and foremost in industrial construction. In 
particular, production of prefabricated ferroconcrete, panels 
for preassembled-component house building, and aluminum alloy 
components declined by 25-30 percent; of steel and roof panels 
and light metal constructions--by 57-63 percent. 
  The output of general-use construction materials declined to 
a somewhat lesser extent. Production of cement amounted to 2.3 
million tonnes (40 percent less than in January 1993), 
brick--1.1 billion units (22 percent less), window glass--7.0 
million square meters (31 percent less), and soft roofing and 
insulation materials--28.3 million square meters (39 percent 
less). 
  A considerable decline occurred in January in the production 
of asbestos-cement items. Suspension of production of high-grade 
asbestos in the first half of January led to a decline in the 
output of roof slate by 80 percent, and asbestos-cement pipe and 
couplers by 49 percent. 
  Production of consumer goods in January declined 
as compared to last January by 27 percent, including that of 
nonfood items--by 35 percent, and 
foodstuffs--by 15 percent. 
  At light industry enterprises in January of this 
year 232 million square meters of fabrics was produced (5 
percent less than in January 1993), 31.2 million pairs of 
hosiery (26 percent less), 18.0 million units of knitwear (28 
percent less), and 4.8 million pairs of footwear (54 percent 
less). 
  Shortage of material and financial resources remains the 
main 
cause of production decline, as well as difficulties in 
distribution of final products because of their high prices. 
  Production of goods for children is declining at a faster 
rate. In January of this year as compared to last January, the 
output of hosiery and knitwear for children declined by 32-45 
percent, and of footwear--by almost two-thirds. 
  In the production of complex home appliances the 
output of refrigerators and freezers, universal kitchen 
appliances, and electric juicers is rising. With respect to 
other varieties of home appliances, the January output was below 
that for January 1993: production of washers amounted to 185,000 
(41 percent less); television sets--259,000 (10 percent less); 
tape recorders--102,000 units (49 percent less) and porcelain, 
stoneware, and majolica tableware--36.6 million units (19 
percent less). 
  As compared to January 1993, the output of vegetable oil, 
high fat cheese and feta cheese, canned milk, and mayonnaise 
increased somewhat. Production of most foodstuffs 
declined somewhat as compared to January 1993: there were 
192,000 tonnes of meat produced (24 percent less), 546,000 
tonnes of whole milk products (16 percent less), 23,600 tonnes 
of butter (39 percent less), 1,088,000 tonnes of flour (18 
percent less), and 110,000 tonnes of cereals (30 percent less). 
  The process of sugar beet processing is nearly complete. In 
January of this year 82,400 tonnes of granulated sugar was 
produced from sugar beet, which is 14 percent less than over the 
corresponding period of last year. 
  Production of canned meat, baker's yeast, tea, and macaroni 
and confectionery items lagged considerably (21-41 percent) 
behind that of January 1993. Commercial bakeries reduced 
production of bread and bakery items by 12 percent. Production 
of some varieties of baby food continues to contract. The output 
of canned meat and grain-based dry mixes for baby and 
restricted-diet nutrition amounted to 20 percent and 11 percent, 
respectively, of the January 1993 level. One of the main reasons 
for this contraction is a build-up of unsold inventories at 
enterprises. 
<H5>  Preparation for Spring Sowing </H5>
  On the threshold of spring sowing, Russia's enterprises are 
in somewhat worse shape with respect to supply of seed of spring 
grain crops. 
  By the beginning of February the seed supply at farms 
amounted to 10.3 million tonnes of spring grain crop seeds (not 
including corn), or 98.5 of the needed quantities as determined 
by the farms themselves. The supply of wheat and millet seed is 
adequate. 
  At the same time, farms are short 9,000 tonnes of buckwheat 
seed (7 percent), 5,000 tonnes of rice seed (8 percent), and 
115,000 tonnes of legume seed (12 percent). 
  There is a considerable shortage of seed potatoes (441,000 
tonnes, or 17 percent).

  Farms on 30 territories in Russia have the full supply of 
seed they need for spring grain crops. Farms in Kaluga, 
Yaroslavl, Samara, Penza, Tyumen, and Chita Oblasts have 80-90 
percent of needed quantities; at the same time, in most of the 
territories listed above this year's spring sowing will have to 
make up for a considerable shortfall in the sowing of winter 
grain crops in the fall of last year. 
  Farms in Smolensk, Perm, and Sverdlovsk Oblasts and 
Bashkortostan have 56-65 percent of the needed quantities of 
seed potatoes; in Vladimir, Moscow, and Lipetsk Oblasts--71-75 
percent. 
  Preparation of machinery for spring field work is proceeding 
at a slower pace that past years. By the beginning of this 
February one-fourth of tractors and trucks and approximately 
one-third of plows, cultivators, and seeders were in need of 
repair.

  The highest proportional share of tractors and trucks, 
soil-tilling equipment, and seeders in need of repairs was 
reported at agricultural enterprises in Arkhangelsk, Pskov, 
Ivanovo, Kaluga, Ryazan, Nizhniy Novgorod, Kurgan, Perm, and 
Amur Oblasts. 
  In January of this year agricultural petroleum products 
storage facilities received one-third less diesel fuel and 
gasoline than January last year. Stocks of petroleum products as 
of 1 February were considerably below last year's level.

  Farms in Vologda, Novgorod, Vladimir, Kirov, Tambov, 
Ulyanovsk, Chelyabinsk, and Kemerovo Oblasts had on hand only 
20-40 percent of last year's quantities of diesel fuel and 
gasoline. 
<H5>  The State of Animal Husbandry </H5>
  In January of this year at all categories of farms, 
including 
the population's plots and private farms, sales of livestock and 
poultry for slaughter dropped by 13 percent as compared to the 
same period of last year, milk yields--by 9 percent, and egg 
production--by 6 percent. 
  At agricultural enterprises, which account for the 
production 
of 60-70 percent of all animal husbandry output, production 
volumes in January were as follows:

  The output of animal husbandry products at agricultural 
enterprises declined practically everywhere. As compared to last 
January, sales of livestock and poultry for slaughter declined 
in 62 territories of Russia; gross milk yield--in all 
territories with the exception of Krasnoyarsk Kray and 
Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast; and egg production--in 56 
regions. The most significant decline in the production of meat, 
milk, and eggs took place at agricultural enterprises in Kursk, 
Tambov, Rostov, and Omsk Oblasts and Stavropol Kray. 
  The production decline in most territories was caused mainly 
by reductions in the herd of livestock and poultry. By the 
beginning of February the herd of horned cattle at agricultural 
enterprises had decreased by 10 percent as compared to the 
corresponding date of last year; cows--by 7 percent, swine--by 
13 percent, and sheep and goats--by 22 percent. 
  The greatest reductions in the herd of main categories of 
livestock occurred at farms in Kursk, Volgograd, Samara, 
Saratov, Rostov, Tomsk, Tyumen, and Kaliningrad Oblasts and 
Stavropol Kray. 
  The decline in the size of herd at agricultural enterprises 
is only partially offset by an increase in the number of animals 
on the population's personal plots. 
<H5>  City and Local Transportation Services for the Population </H5>
  In January 1994 in almost one-quarter of the republic's 
capital cities and kray and oblast centers of the Russian 
Federation more than 15 percent of the planned trips by city 
ground passenger transportation were not made. The figures for 
individual cities where public transportation operations were 
most irregular are presented below:

percent, 1,400); Orenburg (23 percent, 3,700); Novosibirsk (21 
percent, 3,400); Rostov-na-Donu (18 percent, 2,900); and 
Volgograd (18 percent, 2,500). 
  During January of this year 1,300 runs on local commuter 
electric trains (34 percent of the scheduled number) were 
canceled in Volgograd; in St. Petersburg--100 (1 percent); 
Moscow--74 (0.2 percent); Krasnoyarsk--32 (2 percent); Kursk--28 
(5 percent); and Tver--8 (1 percent). 
<H5>  Exchange Trading </H5>
  As of the beginning of 1994, 180 commodity, commodity and 
stock, and stock exchanges were operating in Russia. Over the 
past year their number decreased by almost one-third. Most 
exchanges that ceased operations were in Moscow, Novosibirsk, 
Tyumen, Samara, and Saratov Oblasts, and Maritime Kray. Exchange 
closings are mostly the result of their conversion into trading 
houses, liquidation of economically weak exchanges, and loss of 
buyers because of high prices for products and goods. 
  Over the elapsed year exchange activities were characterized 
by the following data:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The bulk of exchange activities is concentrated at 40 
exchanges (13 of which are in Moscow), which account for 87 
percent of all turnover. 
  Typically they hold trading sessions regularly; their volume 
of sales is on the increase; and they deal in futures contracts 
that guarantee delivery of a product at a certain time. The 
proportional share of operations in buying and selling futures 
contracts amounted to 9 percent of the 1993 turnover as compared 
to 1 percent at the beginning of the same year. 
  In December 1993 four exchanges (Moscow commodity, Russian 
commodity and raw materials, Russian grain commodities, and 
Murmansk commodity and raw materials) began selling agricultural 
products received from the United States as humanitarian aid. 
Over this month they sold 510,000 tonnes of wheat, 210,000 
tonnes of corn, 85,000 tonnes of rice, 4,500 tonnes of pork, and 
1,600 tonnes of chicken legs. Average exchange prices were 
considerably lower than domestic producers' prices: the price of 
pork was R700-800 per kg, chicken legs--R1,000, wheat--R27-32, 
corn--R25, and rice--R75 per kg. 
  The structure of exchange turnover has changed. Over the 
elapsed year the share of sales of securities and monetary 
resources increased by 41 percentage points, while that of 
consumer goods and producer goods declined, respectively, by 18 
and 23 percentage points. 
  The volume of output sold through exchanges remains 
insignificant in the total production and amounts to about 2 
percent; with respect to individual items it fluctuates in the 
range of between 0.05 percent and 6 percent. Many enterprises 
and organizations in the environment of poor solvency and high 
exchange prices prefer to purchase products direct or through 
barter. In particular, in 1993 direct sales of automotive 
gasoline were 5.5 times greater than those through exchanges, 
and of diesel fuel--18 times greater. 
  This review has been prepared using data of the Russian 
State Committee on Statistics

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Istomin: "Charity Begins at Home..."] </F>
  [Text] The policy line of reform in agriculture, which 
seemed to have had only destructive aims, now appears to be 
relenting. Actually, to put it more precisely, it is preparing 
to relent. This is the impression that was created by the press 
conference Russian Vice-Premier A.Kh. Zaveryukha held when he 
returned from Orel. It is time to recover from the shock, the 
vice premier stressed. It is time to begin protecting the 
domestic producer of goods and to supply the population with 
stocks of its own food. 
  This year Russia will officially refuse to import many types 
of agricultural products, or at least will not be buying them in 
the same quantities as before. Calculations have shown that we 
have enough forage grain, for example. Of course, this does not 
mean that the country will call a complete halt to integration 
with foreign partners. It still cannot get by without buying 
part of its corn, groats, and components for the mixed feed 
industry. 
  Protection will also be required for animal husbandry, a 
branch which suffered more than others last year--the output of 
meat and milk decreased and the size of the herd was reduced. 
Furthermore, the products of our meat combines are frequently 
crowded off store counters by inferior but cheaper foreign 
products. Apparently, more formidable customs tariffs will be 
instituted for these imports. 
  As for the financial status of the agroindustrial complex, 
it 
is more critical than ever before. The reason is that capital 
investments in agriculture are incommensurate with the 
proportional importance of this branch in the economy: It 
accounts for more than 30 percent of the gross national product. 
And what about the price disparities? Last year the prices of 
agricultural products increased 8.5-fold while the prices of 
manufactured goods increased 12-fold. Furthermore, a debt of 1.8 
trillion rubles is already owed to the rural community, and this 
is the reason for all of the unclaimed fertilizer, equipment, 
fuel.... 
  There is still time to correct the situation, however. The 
vice premier reported that allocations to agriculture in just 
the first quarter might amount to 2.3 trillion rubles. 
Otherwise, the upcoming sowing season could be disrupted. In 
all, the government has requested around 14 trillion rubles for 
specific programs. This would be enough to make the agrarian 
sector work, even if not at top efficiency. Otherwise, A.Kh. 
Zaveryukha stressed, we can return to the shovel and rake.

Zaveryukha's address at 1994 Russian Wholesale Food Fair in 
Smolensk] 
  [Text] The day after the conference in Orel, Vice-Premier 
A. Zaveryukha of the RF Government flew to Smolensk for the 1994 
Russian Wholesale Food Trade Fair. The vice premier's interest 
in the fair is understandable. After all, it is taking place in 
an atmosphere of budding market relations and essentially should 
serve as the prototype of future business contacts between the 
producers and buyers of food. 
  When the agrarian reform was being carried out, priority is 
known to have been assigned to changes in forms of property 
ownership and economic management. The problems of product sales 
were virtually overlooked. In fact, to put it more precisely, 
they were ignored. 
  It is not surprising that this resulted in the emergence of 
numerous middlemen (experts estimate that there are 7 million of 
them at this time) who are appropriating a high percentage of 
the earnings of agricultural producers--up to 30-40 percent of 
the market price. All of this is heightening the local 
monopolism of the processing industry and trade and impeding 
sales of agricultural products. This has resulted in the 
creation of the artificial problem of simulated agricultural 
overproduction. 
  When A. Zaveryukha addressed visitors to the fair, he said 
that the government is now planning ways of accumulating 
national food resources. To this end, the ministries of 
economics and finance will have to arrange for government 
regulation of public purchasing power, the guaranteed sale of 
agricultural products, and the provision of agricultural 
producers with incentives for increased output. 
  In addition, this year there will be a substantial decrease 
in federal demand and the number of federal consumers. Food 
purchases by the government will be used only to satisfy the 
needs of military personnel and equivalent groups of consumers, 
to contribute part of the food supplies of the cities of Moscow 
and St. Petersburg and regions of the Far North, to supplement 
state reserves, and to create operational government reserves of 
a select group of products: grain, potatoes, vegetables, meat, 
dairy products, eggs, sugar, vegetable oil, and fish. The 
emphasis will be on local production, because less food will be 
brought in from CIS countries, and there are virtually no plans 
for centralized imports. 
  In this way, the supply of food for the public and all 
consumers will be redirected into market channels. Wholesale 
food markets are to be set up on the federal and regional levels 
to speed up the transition to more effective forms of trade, 
facilitate the offer of agricultural items and food to consumers 
by producers, give consumers free access to goods, speed up the 
delivery of food products to the retail trade network, establish 
realistic market prices, and regulate settlements. 
  This system should include rayon wholesale markets, 
interrayon livestock markets, and large urban wholesale potato, 
produce, meat, and fish markets. The system will also include 
specialized and general exchanges trading in grain, oil and 
oil-bearing seeds, sugar, and several other foods, as well as 
forward exchanges and futures. 
  The Russian wholesale food fair was attended by more than 
1,700 representatives of industry and wholesale trade in Russia, 
the CIS countries, and the Baltic states and of several foreign 
firms, small businessmen, and the agents of various commercial 
structures.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Money Is Starting To Come In"] </F>
  [Text] The agroindustrial complex is starting to receive 
money from the state credit of 1.3 trillion rubles allocated in 
the first quarter of this year. Around 800 billion rubles will 
be used directly in agriculture. 
  As Vice-Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent, this will be enough to cover the end of the 
livestock wintering season, the preparations for spring sowing, 
and the payment of the many debts of farms to numerous suppliers. 
  Aleksandr Zaveryukha still hopes that the agroindustrial 
complex will receive the requested 6 trillion rubles in credit 
in the first half of the year. He believes that branches of the 
complex cannot survive their present difficulties without this 
money. The use of credit, tax, and price policies to support 
agriculture is a common practice in all countries, he stressed. 
This is particularly important today, now that price disparities 
are growing more pronounced. Last year the prices of 
agricultural products increased 8.5-fold, but the prices of 
manufactured goods increased 12-fold. 
  In reference to the heated arguments over the financial 
requests of the agroindustrial complex, Aleksandr Zaveryukha 
suggested that certain groups are disturbed by the position of 
complex administrators. These groups, which include officials 
from some ministries and departments, he remarked, "are 
infuriated that we are not requisitioning imports, requesting 
credits for imports, or requesting funds in connection with the 
so-called coefficients that forced us to lower the prices of our 
own products to someone's benefit. They also object to our 
insistence on the use of customs duties for the slight reduction 
of food imports." 
  The vice premier said that the projected financing for the 
agroindustrial complex is "closely related to the preliminary 
budget." The budget is based on earlier decisions, particularly 
the presidential edict on the creation of a fund to support the 
most important branches of the national economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Ostrovskiy: "Get Your Money Ready: The </F>
Government is Allocating Preferential Credit to Agriculture. The 
Pace of Inflation Will Increase in Coming Months"] 
  [Text] For 2.5 hours on 3 February the members of the 
government's presidium discussed the draft, "Economic Conditions 
for the Operation of the Agricultural Complex in 1994." 
  Since it is traditional to make up subtitles to government 
documents, in my opinion this one could be called the classic 
manual to branch lobbying. 
  The 24 points contain almost everything against which the 
reform government struggled for 2 years, as, for example, 
government subsidies for the procurement from abroad of agents 
to protect vegetation and raw materials for the food industry, 
and the cancellation of duties on imported spare parts and 
equipment for some branches of industry. These are seemingly 
innocuous points, but they radically undermine domestic 
industry, especially the chemical industry, machine building and 
the military industrial complex. With government protection of 
the domestic market they would be able to supply the 
agroindustrial complex with all it needed, but without it the 
domestic industry will not be able to withstand competition with 
foreign suppliers. 
  Let us say that the procurement of sugar from abroad 
requires 
a 20-percent duty. Even without this, our sugar prices are the 
highest in the world. Now the sugar barons, protected from 
competition, will be able to do with us what they will. 
  It is possible to analyze every point of the document, but 
it 
is better to provide summary figures. In the course of this year 
direct subsidies from budget allocations will equal 14.1 
trillion rubles; the creation of a federal food fund will 
require 14.5 trillion; and special-purpose preferential credit 
for spring field work - 6 trillion. Add some other benefits to 
this and you will have a total of 34.7 trillion. 
  From past experience we know that ultimately almost half of 
preferential credit is transformed into cash and appears on the 
market. The reaction to this will be unequivocal -- first there 
will be an increase in the cost of durable goods because they 
are purchased in expectation of inflation. We can assume that in 
the coming 2-3 months there will be a sharp increase in the cost 
of televisions, refrigerators, VCR's and other embellishments of 
our lives. 
  We cannot avoid price fixing on the hard currency market, 
which is completely understandable because people prefer to 
exchange "mad money" for something more dependable, i.e., hard 
currency. During the January panic about 2 trillion rubles were 
thrown into the currency market. What if several times more 
rubles follow this route? In such a case we cannot rule out that 
B. Fedorov's prediction that by year's end $1 will be equivalent 
to 10,000 rubles might come to pass even sooner. 
  Everything taken together -- the sugar, meat, flour and milk 
monopolies, their protection from competition with cheap foreign 
products, and the growing pace of inflation -- will result in 
price increases. I think that very soon we will be paying 10,000 
rubles for a kilogram of meat and 20,000 for a kilogram of 
butter. 
  The government has already corrected its goals for the end 
of 
the year several times. First there was talk of 4-5 percent 
inflation in December, then 7-9 percent and then 15-16 percent. 
But independent experts feel that the upheavals arising from the 
implementation of "economic conditions" will be so painful that 
already in April inflation may exceed 30 percent, and in July -- 
50 percent. Why should millions of Russians suffer new 
deprivations and difficulties? 
  The attack on the state treasury proceeded under the pretext 
that it is essential to rescue the village and to save the 
peasant from death by starvation. But is the situation within 
the branch all that tragic? In the course of 2 years production 
volume decreased within the branch at the slowest pace -- by 4-5 
percent as compared to 16-19 percent in industry and 24-27 
percent in transportation. Last year there was an increase in 
the consumption of almost all types of food products except fish 
and vegetables. Especially great was increased consumption of 
sugar, confectionery goods, fruit and citrus products -- by 21 
percent. 
  The average wage within the agroindustrial complex is 80,000 
rubles. At the same time, if we take into consideration income 
from private plots, then peasants receive more than the workers 
of half of the sectors of our economy. Perhaps it is not a 
matter of poverty? 
  Everyone who lives in this country realizes that the entire 
society is in debt to the village. We would not begrudge any 
amount of money if it were directed into solving the most acute 
social problems and into structural reorganization. 
Unfortunately, there is no talk of this. 
  The people's money will be used according to former methods 
-- to support that which exists, and not for a structural 
transformation of the village. This is a guarantee that these 
tens of trillions will not be enough. They, like previous credit 
infusions, will disappear into the black hole of ineffective 
agricultural production. 
  On 3 February the draft was not passed. But we can assume 
that the basic numbers will not change because the only voices 
of opposition were those of A. Chubays, S. Dubinin and V. 
Mashits. 
  At the meeting one of the representatives of the 
agroindustrial complex said: "The Russian people must feed their 
peasants." It cannot be said any better. 
  So, fellow countrymen, get out your wallets.

<F P=106> [Article by G. Vasilyev: "Ruinous Price Discrepancies"] </F>
  [Text] Each one of us is a consumer. Naturally we become 
very upset when faced with the unpleasant fact of increased 
prices for goods, especially for food products. 
  There are many factors that contribute to the growth in 
market prices. One of the important ones is increased 
procurement prices for agricultural products. But do enterprises 
themselves benefit from them? The growth in procurement prices 
only partially covers expenditures by villagers needed to obtain 
industrial goods. Let us look at data recently prepared by the 
price policy administration of the Russian Ministry of 
Agriculture. Here is how procurement prices for agricultural 
products increased in terms of 1986 prices after so-called price 
liberalization. In 1992 they increased by a factor of 18, and in 
1993 -- by a factor of almost 150. Now let us look at how 
wholesale prices for industrial goods have changed. During these 
years they increased by factors of 44 and 495 respectively. 
  It is not difficult to see that the pace of growth of prices 
for industrial products is considerably higher than for 
agricultural, and this difference is increasing. Procurement 
prices should be increased at least threefold in order to give 
villagers the opportunity to buy material-technical products in 
the necessary quantities. But at present no one is moving in 
this direction. To act in this manner means to overstock store 
shelves with food products in the face of their obvious 
shortage. The problem comes up against the low solvency of the 
population. 
  Despite the difficult economic situation within industry as 
well, its enterprises nevertheless find themselves in an 
advantageous position as compared to agricultural enterprises. 
Their products can "await" a buyer until better times. But many 
agricultural products are subject to rapid deterioration. This 
is why it is not wise, and even wasteful, to establish very high 
prices for them. 
  Today specialists suggest various ways to eliminate the 
negative consequences of price disparities for industrial and 
agricultural products. Some feel that supplementary expenditures 
by villagers related to non-equivalent exchange between the city 
and the village should be covered by adequate government 
subsidies. Others propose the introduction of guaranteed 
(protective) prices that will provide peasants with a minimum 
income needed for simple reproduction. But the amounts of 
subsidies remain small and are allocated with great delays, and 
protective prices remain good intentions. 
  In actuality, the problem does not lie in the selection of a 
form for providing financial support for villagers. It is 
important to provide a type of aid that will protect them from 
inflation and enable them to manage efficiently and profitably. 
It is this kind of considerable support that the developed 
countries of Western countries give to their farmers, and this 
experience is what our people like to cite more and more often.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Shcherbakov: "The Debt is Being Repaid, But </F>
Clearly in Devalued Form; 2.3 Trillion Rubles Allocated to the 
Agricultural Sector by the Government -- A Late Payment For 
Products Delivered Last Year"] 
  [Text] Last week on 3 February at a closed session the 
Government of the Russian Federation examined the draft 
resolution, "Economic Conditions for the Operation of the 
Agroindustrial Complex in 1994," at a closed session. According 
to this draft, it is planned to allocate 14 trillion rubles from 
the budget to support agriculture. The resolution as a whole was 
approved, but under the condition that finishing touches be put 
on it and that certain figures and details be made more precise. 
Judging by everything, the figures, which are nothing but 
financial resources being directed into the APK [Agroindustrial 
complex], will be correction in the direction of a decrease. 
  This decision reminded me of a recent reaction by some mass 
media to a regional meeting in Orel, where a program for the 
development of the regions in Central Russia was being 
discussed. At that time, specific steps taken by the government 
to effect the economic, social and spiritual rebirth of the 
age-old Russian central regions were termed "political 
demonstrations," "attempts to win authority by means of handing 
out financial benefits to territories and the agricultural 
sector" by some newspapers. 
  At that time, A. Zaveryukha, deputy prime minister of the RF 
Government, held a press conference for Russian and foreign 
journalists. He was forced to clarify, patiently and on a 
popular level, the absurdities of the newspapers' 
disinformation, as for example that concerning 2.3 trillion 
rubles that were soon to be directed into the agrarian sector. 
What money is this? However, government and non-government 
consumers do owe a debt for products, including grain, acquired 
from village goods producers. Moreover, this debt was incurred 
in August to September, and it can be termed preferential with 
complete justification. Add to it how much the ruble has been 
devalued during the last 4-5 months. Is the suggestion being 
made that we should not repay our debt to the peasant because we 
must stabilize the budget? 
  A similar situation is developing with regard to the delay 
in 
signing the government document that is important for the entire 
agricultural sector. Sowing operations are right around the 
corner. How will kolkhozes, sovkhozes, farmers, joint-stock 
societies, partnerships and cooperatives implement sowing 
operations if all they have in their accounts is the debts owed 
to them by the government and not a single penny cash? As we 
know, oil producers, machine builders and chemical workers do 
not sell their products for credit. Moreover, they demand a 100 
percent prepayment. 
  We have untuned machinery standing idle in enterprises, and 
mineral fertilizer storehouses remain empty although the 
enterprises that sell these products stop production due to 
overstocking. According to data from the agrochemical service, 
in many regions of the country enterprises have acquired only 
2-3 kilograms of mineral fertilizer of the amount needed per 
hectare of plowland. This situation is threatening not only in 
terms of a considerable underproduction from fields and farms 
this year, but also, and this is especially important, in terms 
of a catastrophic fall in land fertility. As we know, fertility 
cannot be restored in just 1-2 years. And the expenditures that 
will be required will not be comparable to today's so-called 
preferential credit. 
  An especially alarming situation has developed in supplying 
enterprises, regardless of form of ownership, with fuel and 
lubricating materials and seed. This spring there will be a 
significantly larger demand for these than last year. Last fall 
because of the complicated weather conditions and again because 
of the absence of money it was not possible to plow up late fall 
fields or sow winter crops on many millions of hectares. 
  Judging by everything, in government not everyone is 
concerned with current conditions within the country's 
agroindustrial complex, especially since the course that has 
been set involves self-sufficiency in food products. Here we 
cannot do simply with declarations and assurances about devotion 
to reforms. Specific actions are needed, particularly in 
protecting domestic production.

<F P=106> [Article by meteorologist Lyudmila Parshina: "Spring the </F>
Beautiful"] 
  [Text] The weather during the last winter month on the 
territory of the European part of Russia was mostly cold. The 
coldest temperatures were registered closer to the middle of the 
month, when the freezing Arctic air penetrated all the way to 
southernmost latitudes. 
  On clear nights the temperature in many cities in Russia and 
the Baltic countries dropped below the absolute lowest values. 
On 12-13 February new cold records were registered in Kursk, 
Voronezh, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, Saratov, Astrakhan, 
Krasnodar, and Kaliningrad; in Ufa on 12 February the cold 
temperature reached the -40 degree mark. 
  Thus February has lived up to one of its names--"the severe 
month." However, as the end of winter approached, there were few 
blizzards and snowstorms. Only during the last days of the month 
did the snow swirl descend. Still, despite the cold, on clear 
days we were cheered by the sun and the anticipation of imminent 
spring. 
  Ahead of us is March--the morning of the year. True, the 
first half of March is still winter in the middle belt of Russia 
and the north of the country: solid snow cover, frequent 
blizzards and snowstorms. On a considerable part of the European 
territory of the country, however, the average 24-hour 
temperature climbs above the freezing mark, and in the southern 
parts of the country (Sochi) it rises above five degrees. 
  The day of 22 March is the spring equinox, the beginning of 
spring astronomically. The number of sunshine hours increases. 
The snow begins to melt. 
  In the north and the middle belt of Russia there is still 
ice 
cover on rivers in March; in the south of the European territory 
(the lower part of Volga, Don, and Dnieper) the ice begins to 
break. 
  Even more noticeable than in February will be the increase 
in 
daylight hours. And the sun's warmth reaching the earth's 
surface will be twice as great as in February. This is a 
dangerous time for orchards. The trunks of fruit-bearing trees 
crack because of sharp fluctuations in temperature over the 
24-hour period. If the orchard is neglected at this time and the 
trees are not stained with bleach, they will be traumatized and 
may die altogether.

Golubev, chief specialist of the Russian Hydrometeorological 
Center: "The Sound of Dripping Snow!"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Weather for the Month... </H5>
  In its characteristics March is still closer to the winter 
months than to spring. This is indicated both by the negative 
radiation balance (the difference between sun's radiation and 
the earth's surface and the atmosphere's own radiation) and the 
negative values of the average air temperature measured over 
many years on the greater part of the European territory of 
Russia and West and East Siberia. 
  However, as compared to February, in March the temperature 
begins to rise quickly. Therefore, on the entire territory of 
Russia (with the exception of the shores of Arctic seas) March 
is four to 12 degrees warmer than February. 
  March's weather characteristics on the territory of the 
former USSR vary. While in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus 
orchards are already in bloom in March and seedlings appear in 
the fields, in the middle belt of European Russia the first 
thawed patches appear in the fields. At the same time, in the 
northern part of the territory, Siberia, and the northern part 
of Kazakhstan winter still reigns supreme, with bitter cold and 
blizzards. 
  What will March look like this year? 
  On the entire European territory of Russia (with the 
exception of the North Caucasus) and the southern parts of 
Ukraine temperatures will one to three degrees above normal. 
  In Murmansk, Arkhangelsk, Vologda Oblast, and the 
Republics of Karelia and Komi the prevailing air 
temperature at night will be minus six to 11, and at daytime 
between minus two and plus three degrees. On some days of the 
first 10-day period night temperatures may drop to minus 16-21, 
and daytime temperatures to minus six to 11. 
  In Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov, and Kaliningrad 
Oblasts--minus three to eight at night and freezing to plus 
five in during the day. Night temperatures may drop to minus 
10-15 and daytime temperatures to minus two to seven during the 
first and third five-day periods. 
  Weather patterns will be approximately the same in the 
Central and Central Chernozem regions. 
  In Nizhniy Novgorod and Kirov Oblasts and the Republics 
of Mordovia, Chuvashia, and Mari El minus five to 10 at 
night and freezing to plus five during the day. Night 
temperatures may drop to minus 16-21 and daytime temperatures to 
minus six to 11 during the first and third five-day periods. 
  In the Volga region minus one to six at night, 
plus one to six during the day. 
  In the North Caucasus and southern Ukraine the 
average monthly temperatures will be close to normal. Freezing 
to plus five at night and plus 11-16 during the day. Night 
temperatures may briefly drop to minus two to seven and daytime 
temperatures to minus four to plus one during the first five-day 
period. 
  In Sverdlovsk, Perm, Chelyabinsk, Kurgan, and Orenburg 
Oblasts, Bashkortostan and Udmurtia minus five to 10 at 
night and freezing to plus five during the day. In the middle of 
the month night temperatures may drop to minus 15-20 and daytime 
temperatures to minus eight to 13. 
  In the northern part of Ukraine minus two to plus 
three at night and plus 8 to 13 during the day. Night 
temperatures may drop to minus three to eight and daytime 
temperatures to minus one to six on some days during the first 
and third five-day periods. 
  In Belarus and the Baltic countries minus three to 
plus two at night and plus four to nine during the day. In the 
middle of the month colder temperatures are expected, down to 
minus four to nine at night and to minus two to seven during the 
day. 
  The Black Sea shore of the Caucasus and the southern 
shore of Crimea will be springlike warm. Plus two to seven 
at night, plus 13-18 during the day. However, here, too, a brief 
drop in temperatures is possible in the middle of the 
month--freezing to minus five at night and plus one to six 
during the day. 
  In Novosibirsk, Omsk, Tomsk, and Kemerovo Oblasts and 
Altay Kray freezing cold at night--minus nine to 14, and 
plus one to six during the day. On some days during the first 
and third 10-day periods possibly colder--to minus 17-22, and 
minus seven to 12 degrees during the day. 
  In Irkutsk Oblast and in the south of Krasnoyarsk 
Kray the average monthly temperature is close to normal; in 
Buryatia, Tuva, and Chita Oblast--one degree above 
normal. In these areas, cold at night--minus seven to 12, and 
minus two to plus three during the day. Colder on some days 
during the second 10-day period--to minus 22-27 at night and 
minus 15-20 degrees during the day. 
  In Amur Oblast and Maritime and Khabarovsk Krays 
the average monthly temperatures will be one to three degrees 
above normal. Cold at night--minus 10-15, and minus five to 10 
during the day. Possibly colder on some days during the first 
10-day period--to minus 25-30 at night and minus 15-20 degrees 
during the day. 
  In the central area of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) 
and Magadan Oblast March will be winterly cold. Cold at 
night--minus 25-30, daytime--minus 15-20 degrees. Night 
temperatures may drop to minus 40-45 and daytime temperatures to 
minus 25-30 degrees on some days during the first and third 
five-day periods. 
<H5>  ...And Today </H5>
  The Russian Hydrometeorological Center reports that an 
anticyclone from Scandinavia brought colder temperatures to the 
northwestern and central oblasts of Russia. Following the 
Atlantic cyclone's move to the east, temperatures dropped in the 
Upper and Middle Volga areas, with snow and blizzards.

<F P=106> [Article by health resort physician Asya Uyanayeva under the </F>
rubric "Meteorological Dictionary": "These Dangerous Thaws"] 
  [Text] The weather in moderate latitudes is formed in a 
struggle between warm and moist sea air and cold, relatively 
dry, air forming in Arctic latitudes. 
  Over the past years on the European territory of the country 
winters have been warm, with frequent invasions of Atlantic 
cyclones. The result of this process was protracted thaws. 
  The meteorological dictionary gives the following 
definition: 
A thaw is the warming of air temperature to the freezing mark 
and above in winter time amidst temperatures that have settled 
below freezing, most often as a result of the spread of warm air. 
  On the European territory of the country thaws result from a 
stream of either moderate latitude sea air from the Atlantic 
Ocean or the moderate latitude air returning from southern 
regions through the Balkans and Asia Minor. Thaws are frequently 
preceded by snowstorms. They are accompanied by cloudy, foggy 
weather. 
  What is the danger of thaw periods? First and foremost, the 
snow begins to melt, which increases the probability that 
wintering plants will be subjected to the impact of the cold 
when cold temperatures return. If the snow cover is low, and the 
impact of warm air is long enough, the snow may to a 
considerable extent or even completely melt. 
  The southern and western regions of the European territory 
of 
the country are subjected to the most frequent thaws. In the 
current year December and January had plenty of protracted 
thaws, which were only briefly interrupted by minor cold spells. 
The most frequent thaws occur in March, when the atmosphere 
shifts to summer mode.

<F P=106> [Agricultural forecast by Tamara Maksimenkova, chief </F>
agrometeorologist of the Agricultural Meteorological Forecasts 
Department of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center: "Under the 
Snow Blanket"] 
  [Text] Over almost all of February, cold weather persisted 
over the entire territory of Russia. It warmed up only during 
the last few days of the month; precipitation, on the other 
hand, was low (mostly 20-40 percent of the normal level). The 
coldest temperatures in the European part of Russia were 
registered during the first half of the month. The average 
temperature during that period was eight to 12 degrees below 
normal. 
  However, on the greater part of the territory of the 
Central, 
Central Chernozem, in the south of the Volgo-Vyatka and Urals 
regions, and in the Middle Volga area winter grain crops and 
perennial grasses were securely protected from cold by a 
sufficiently high snow cover. In most places it was 35-45 
centimeters high, which is one and a half to two times as high 
as the average value calculated over many years. 
  The lowest soil temperature at the winter grain tilling 
depth 
here stayed mainly within the optimum range--minus six to minus 
nine degrees, and the extreme cold (minus 28-35 degrees and 
below) was not dangerous for the crops. 
  In the Central Chernozem region, in the eastern part of the 
Central region, and in the Middle Volga area registered cold 
temperatures (below -28 degrees) could cause damage to flower 
buds and the annual growth of fruit-bearing plants in some 
places. 
  In the Northern, the northern part of the Central, and in 
the 
north part of the Volgo-Vyatka and Urals regions winter grain 
crops were still under a very high (55-65 centimeters or more) 
snow cover. Soil did not freeze much under such a blanket. 
  Rotting process have been noticed over the greater part of 
the month. Plants continued to intensively use up nutrients for 
breathing, which leads to their exhaustion. These conclusions 
are supported by results of test sprouting of winter crops 
conducted by meteorological stations. Higher than usual 
sparseness of winter rye plants in tests (more than 10 percent 
of plants, and in places more than 30 percent) has been already 
noted in a number of rayons in Vologda, Yaroslavl, and Kirov 
Oblasts, as well as in some fields in Arkhangelsk and Perm 
Oblasts and the Republic of Bashkortostan. The lowest soil 
temperature at the tilling depth of winter crops was around 
freezing in February as well. 
  In the North Caucasus and the Lower Volga area the coldest 
temperatures were registered in the beginning of the second 
10-day period of February. The average air temperature during 
this period was seven to 12 degrees below normal. There was no 
snow cover in the fields, or its height was no more than 1-3 
centimeters. The soil cooled quickly. The lowest soil 
temperature at the winter grain tilling depth dropped to minus 
12-15 degrees. 
  In the south of Rostov Oblast, in a number of rayons in 
Krasnodar Kray, and in some rayons in Stavropol Kray, as well as 
in Kalmykia and Astrakhan Oblast, the soil temperature at the 
winter crops tilling depth was even lower--minus 16-18 degrees 
(in the south of Astrakhan Oblast -20 degrees). In this region, 
winterkilling is possible over a considerable part of the area, 
especially of underdeveloped crops of winter wheat and barley, 
and in the south of Astrakhan Oblast, of rye. 
  An unfavorable factor for further wintering of winter crops 
is that a ground-in ice crust remains on the soil in the fields 
in the Northwestern, Central, and Central Chernozem regions and 
in some places in the south of the Volga Region. Its thickness 
practically has not increased in February and measured 15-30 
millimeters in most places, and in Saratov and Volgograd 
Oblasts, 10-20 millimeters. 
  In West Siberia, winter grain crops in February were under a 
snow cover that in most places was 25-45 centimeters high or 
more. Therefore, despite severe cold temperatures registered 
during some periods of the month, the lowest soil temperature at 
the winter crops tilling depth stayed mostly within the range of 
-7 to -12 degrees and only in some places in Altay Kray and 
Kemerovo Oblast did it drop to minus 16-20 degrees. The 
wintering of winter grain crops in February proceeded well. 
  According to the preliminary forecast of the Russian 
Hydrometeorological Center, the average air temperature in March 
over the greater part of territory is expected to be one to 
three degrees above average. Only on the greater part of the 
territory of the North Caucasus region will it be close to 
normal. 
  The amount of precipitation to the south of the 
Kaluga-Penza-Samara line is expected to be below normal; in the 
Northwestern region and in the Urals--above normal. On the rest 
of the territory of the European part of Russia it will be close 
to normal. 
  In the northeastern part of the European territory higher 
than usual temperatures expected in March (two-three degrees 
above normal) will help to melt snow in the fields and to 
diminish the rot damage to winter grain crops.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Kalashnikov, Russian deputy minister of </F>
Labor, by EIZh [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Department of Social Problems 
and APK [agroindustrial complex]: "Labor Legislation: New Trends 
and Directions"] 
  [Text] V. Kalashnikov, Russian deputy minister of 
Labor, answers our readers' questions. 
  [EIZh] Viktor Vasilyevich, in our opinion, the existing 
labor 
legislation is to a great extent oriented toward the former 
system of economic operation. The situation has changed sharply, 
however, particularly in the past year: a tremendous number of 
private firms are in operation, and their development is in many 
ways held back by the present labor law. What is the Russian 
Ministry of Labor planning to do this year, what basically new 
documents will it adopt, and what draft laws are being drawn up? 
  [Kalashnikov] In the course of political and economic 
reforms, social processes proceed in an ambiguous way. 
  We are therefore faced this year with the problem of drawing 
up new and revising existing fundamental legislative acts in the 
sphere of labor relations. They include: the Fundamentals of 
Labor Legislation, laws and edicts on the minimum subsistence 
level, settling collective labor disputes and conflicts, 
regulating wages and the insolvency (bankruptcy) of enterprises, 
indexing the minimal amount for wages, unemployment benefits, 
allotments and many others. 
  When drawing up labor legislation, we intend to orient the 
consolidated norms and rules primarily toward achieving higher 
labor productivity and strengthening the socio-economic 
positions of the labor collectives. This is to be ensured on the 
basis of improving the forms and methods of social partnership 
and wages and removing the artificial restrictions to labor 
stimulation. We are now seeking these methods of economic 
influence on all the participants in the labor process. For 
example, the draft of the Law on Social Insurance specifies 
differentiating the rates of enterprises' withholding funds for 
the social insurance fund on the basis of work time lost because 
of illness, occupational illness, and other factors. This will, 
of course, rouse and stimulate employers to improve labor 
conditions, and, on this basis, reduce the number of sick 
workers and the amount of work time lost because of their 
illness. 
  Another point. The system of paying enterprise directors in 
many ways determines the amount and nature of the wages of the 
collective and hired workers. In connection with this, the 
ministry has conceived the idea of determining the wage level of 
state enterprise directors, even if in accordance with the 
recommended procedure, by the appropriate normative acts, so 
that the size of their wages is tied in with the results of 
production activity. 
  In a word, in the process of improving the labor code, 
together with the statute on labor safety and social insurance, 
the main goal is to create, under the new conditions, reliable 
legal protection for every worker and at the same time to 
provide the prerequisites for the further growth of work 
efficiency in the national economy. 
  [EIZh] In the developed countries, the average small 
business 
has a substantial influence on the development of the economy as 
a whole. Russia too is moving in this direction. Let us imagine, 
however, this situation: a new enterprise of 10-20 people, and 
one employee has fallen ill. For four months he cannot be even 
fired. Or another point: when the firing is at management's 
initiative, the employee must be notified two months in advance. 
Indeed, one must even ask for the trade union committee's 
agreement on this. The case, meanwhile, comes to a standstill. 
In the United States, for example, there is no sick list system 
at all. There they have a different, simpler procedure even for 
firing at management's initiative. Why does our country still 
have such a conservative Labor Code? 
  [Kalashnikov] Yes, it is true, in the United States, only 6 
states have legislation on insurance for temporary incapacity, 
and the other 44 do not have it. A number of other countries do 
not start paying benefits for temporary incapacity from the 
first day of the illness: for example, Italy pays from the 
fourth day, and Finland -- from the eighth day of incapacity. 
  These problems, however, must not be considered separately 
from other trends in social security, wage level and other forms 
of social insurance. In the United States, where there is no 
social insurance by legislation, it is widely organized on 
voluntary principles, through commercial insurance companies and 
collective contracts. 
  I do not think that the time has yet come in our country 
when 
we could leave workers without compulsory state social 
insurance. Considering the income level of the basic mass of the 
population, this is fraught with many negative social 
consequences. 
  With respect to the conservatism of the Labor Code as 
regards 
other social guarantees, it can be said that problems mainly 
arise here not with the scale, and not with the size of the 
social guarantees, but with the procedure for their 
presentation. Obviously, with respect to individual social 
guarantees based on improving the tax legislation and the 
procedure for forming social funds, a redistribution of 
responsibility between the state and the workers should be 
carried out. 
  Therefore, the ministry now finds itself seeking improvement 
in labor legislation in all directions. This includes drawing up 
statutes on state support of small-scale entrepreneurship as 
well. We will be grateful for all suggestions on this subject. 
  [EIZh] Viktor Vasilyevich, one of the problems which 
constantly "scares" us is unemployment. It would appear that the 
state's influence over this should be an active one. It can't 
pay money to the unemployed just like that. Who will go work in 
the rural areas, if the unemployment benefits are higher than 
the average wage in agricultural production? With officially 
declared unemployment, our country is full of vacant positions. 
What can you say about this? 
  [Kalashnikov] According to the situation in December of last 
year, the number of persons without work and actively seeking it 
was 3.8 million people, or 5 percent of the economically active 
population. At the same time, approximately the same number of 
the population were working under conditions not constituting 
full employment. Approximately 800,000 people, however, are 
registered with the employment authorities, and have the 
official status of unemployed. The rest are in transit, which, 
according to existing legislation, does not require the payment 
of unemployment benefits. 
  Social surveys show that, given all the existing 
shortcomings 
of the legislation in force on employment problems, it does not 
create a striving to be unemployed. Unemployment benefits are 
paid with a consistent reduction in amounts and a restriction on 
periods and conditions for payment. Polls show that two-thirds 
of the citizens feel: it is better to have a guaranteed wage 
than to get large sums of money and not have the security of a 
job. 
  The existence of free work places, constituting 654,000 at 
the end of the 1st quarter of last year, 703,000 at the end of 
the 2d, and 696,000 at the end of the 3d, is essentially 
unrelated to the rise in unemployment, and mainly depends on the 
lack of correspondence, by type and skill level, of the 
unemployed to the free work places. In this case, women and 
young people predominate among the unemployed. On the whole, the 
effect of the measures taken to ease the negative processes of 
unemployment is so far not great. Not much more than 2 percent 
of the employment fund is spent for vocational training of the 
unemployed and the financing of public works. 
  [EIZh] As things now stand, protecting and improving labor 
conditions is only in second, and sometimes in third place among 
businessmen. Many people in general feel that this is one of the 
courses for saving capital. This is a short-sighted policy, 
though. What is the Russian Ministry of Labor planning to do 
about this in the near future? 
  [Kalashnikov] A critical situation is forming in the country 
with respect to labor safety and conditions. Even under the 
conditions of a cutback in production volumes, there are 6.3 
accidents per 1,000 people yearly in the Russian Federation. 
These official data, however, are obviously understated. 
  Over 8,000 people die in production, and about 15,000 people 
a year become disabled. Production injury with a fatal outcome 
is increasing. 
  There are a considerable number of workers in the 
enterprises 
and organizations of the Russian Federation who continue to work 
while exposed to factors that are harmful and hazardous to their 
health. Over 18 percent of all workers are employed under 
conditions that do not meet the sanitary-hygienic norms.

  The harmful effect of work conditions that do not meet 
sanitary-hygienic requirements is marked not only in the 
1.7-fold rise in vocational illness in the last few years, but 
also in the heightened levels of general illnesses. 
  By decision of the Russian Federation Government, right up 
to 
organizing the appropriate state bodies, the functions of labor 
safety management, specified by the Fundamentals of Legislation, 
have been entrusted to the Russian Ministry of Labor. In 
connection with this, the ministry is taking measures to create, 
in the shortest possible time, a system of state management, 
state supervision and control over labor safety practices at the 
federal and territorial level, to organize work on improving the 
normative base for labor safety, to solve problems of personnel 
training and to work out and put into effect an economic 
mechanism to guarantee labor safety. 
  For these purposes it is specified that a Federal Labor 
Safety Fund be formed and that the territorial organs of 
executive power be given help in creating territorial funds and 
labor safety funds for enterprises. An interdepartmental 
commission on labor safety problems, attached to the Russian 
Federation Government, should be set up. 
  The ministry has now prepared drafts of statutes on a 
Federal 
Labor Safety Fund, on putting into practice an economic 
mechanism to ensure labor safety, on investigating and keeping 
records of production accidents, on supervising and controlling 
labor safety and on the status of the state inspector for labor 
safety, with the necessary drafts of government decrees and 
edicts of the Russian Federation president, which, after the 
appropriate finalizing, should be passed and put into effect. 
  It is intended that the inspectors will be granted the right 
to shut down enterprises and individual production facilities in 
cases when their activity threatens the lives of workers and the 
population; to impose fines and administrative sanctions on 
employers and officials of the enterprise for violation of 
legislative and other normative acts on labor safety. 
  Formation of an economic mechanism and labor safety funds 
pursues the goal, along with creating a mechanism for financial 
support of all state measures in the sphere of labor safety and 
interesting employers in creating the necessary work conditions, 
of achieving the independence of the offices of labor safety 
supervision and control from higher organizations and 
enterprises, which will contribute to the objectivity of their 
decisions. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  Essentially, the questions raised with V.V. Kalashnikov 
are open for discussion. For example, in developed countries, 
the system of social protection is different for state servants 
and workers in private companies. Why, in our country, in 
Russia, is it identical? It would be highly desirable for the 
system to be differentiated in the new Fundamentals of Labor 
Legislation. 
  Another question. Up to now, our labor law has been 
oriented toward identical protection for both the honest worker 
and the negligent one. After all, this is unfair. The 
legislation should primarily be aimed at protecting the 
interests of a citizen who does good work. 
  This problem is inexhaustible. We will continue to 
cover it in future issues. We hope that the developers and 
legislators will take a professional approach to solving the 
problems posed. 
  [Box, p 1] 

  -  Differentiated rates for the social insurance fund await 
entrepreneurs. 
  -  The wages of directors of state enterprises 
should be tied into the end result of the activity. This is what 
the Ministry of Labor thinks. 
  -  The future Federal Labor Safety 
Fund will be able to shut down production for violation of labor 
safety practices.

"The Runaway Decline Has Been Halted, But Somehow Life Has Not 
Become Easier"] 
  [Text] Did we become richer or poorer over the past, 
difficult and troubled, year of 1993? The usual answer to this 
question is: "We are getting impoverished..." If we are to 
believe official figures, however, our life is not all that 
hopeless. And we obtained these figures from the most reliable 
original source--the Russian Department of Labor, which kindly 
made available to us the results of a study "On the Situation in 
the Social and Labor Sphere." So, here is how we lived and 
survived... 
  First and foremost, the study authors note, despite the 
measures aimed at strengthening the social orientation of the 
reforms adopted in 1993, the people's situation remains 
difficult. The level of social guarantees has dropped, and 
income indexation lags behind rises in consumer prices. Our 
poverty had an impact on the demographic situation. Natural 
population loss (number of deaths exceeding the number of 
births) was registered in 68 regions in Russia. Life expectancy 
measured 65.8 years as compared to 69.3 years in 1986. 
  Meanwhile, however, the population's monetary income, taking 
into consideration those engaged in entrepreneurial activities, 
increased 11-fold as compared to 1992. Taking into account the 
consumer price index, income increased by 9 percent. 
  Society is being rapidly stratified into rich and poor. The 
income of the 10 highest percent of the population exceeds the 
income of the poorest by a factor of 11 (as compared to a factor 
of eight in the end of 1992). And this is only according to 
official data. 
  In 1993, 77 percent of the population had an income of less 
than twice the size of the subsistence minimum, including 30 
percent who had an income below the subsistence minimum. The 
poorest (income not exceeding the cost of the minimum food 
basket)--are families with many children, incomplete families, 
and those with several dependents. Despite numerous indexations, 
single pensioners and the disabled also ended up in this group. 
At the same time, a group of "new poor" emerged in Russia in 
1993. This is what official statistics call work-eligible 
citizens whose income has fallen below the subsistence minimum. 
This includes first and foremost the unemployed (of which there 
are already more than 1 million), workers at unprofitable 
enterprises sent on indefinite leave (more than 4 million 
officially), and young people. More than 10 percent of high 
school graduates could not find jobs in 1993, as well as more 
than 70 percent of graduates of elementary vocational schools 
(!), more than 60 percent of graduates of intermediate 
vocational schools, and almost 50 percent of college graduates. 
  The highest level of unemployment currently exists in the 
republics of Mari El, Dagestan, Chuvashia, Adygey, Mordvinia, 
and Pskov, Yaroslavl, and Ivanovo Oblasts, where there are very 
few job vacancies. There are between 11 and 33 contenders for 
each job here. 
  Meanwhile, far from all who have been laid off at 
enterprises 
or have left because of not being paid have registered at the 
labor exchange. The number of those engaged in the nonstate 
sector of the economy has grown sharply and now comprises 40 
percent of the total employed. The number of jobs at state 
enterprises, on the other hands, continues to shrink. 
  The average wage in 1993 increased 9.9-fold as compared to 
1992, which more or less corresponds to the rise in consumer 
prices. However, by December 1993 as compared to December 1992 
it had increased only eightfold, while prices had increased 
almost 10-fold. 
  There are wages and wages, however. It appears that 
everybody 
grasped this axiom in 1993. The past year produced the highest 
divergence in the size of wages in the state and nonstate 
sectors of the economy. The gap between high and low wages by 
the end of the year was measured by a factor of 27. At the same 
time, while high wages at private enterprises can at least be 
explained somehow (they are their own masters, and besides, no 
commercial structure maintains a huge staff), the gap of a 
factor of 12-15 (!) between the salaries of top managers and 
regular workers at state enterprises (without any regard to 
whether they are flourishing or in distress) is harder to 
explain. It appears that zealous directors direct all their 
economic acumen to figuring out how to better line their own 
pockets. 
  Meanwhile, wages are losing their main functions: to provide 
for normal reproduction of labor force and provide incentives 
for effective labor. Increases in them have lost any connection 
with the final results of labor and depend only on price rises. 
  From these statistical data the Ministry of Labor draws 
generally encouraging conclusions. The runaway decline in the 
standard of living of the population, which began in 1992, was 
halted in 1993. Economic reform is proceeding in an environment 
of relatively low unemployment. At the same time, however, the 
number of poor not only has not decreased but actually 
increased, and the number of unemployed (both registered and 
"hidden") has grown considerably. What to do about it is now 
being discussed in thick reports by specialists of the ministry 
of Labor and the Ministry of Social Protection. All we can do is 
wait, or join those 40 percent who have chosen the nonstate 
sector as their sphere of interests.

"Exclusive in TRUD: New Minimum--20,500 Rubles? But in March It 
Will Be Possible to Sustain Oneself With This Money No More Than 
One Week"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Labor [Mintrud] of the Russian 
Federation has prepared draft documents for raising the minimum 
wage, and also the rate for the first grade of the unified 
tariff schedule, from 1 March. 
  It is proposed to increase the minimum wage from 14,620 
rubles to 20,500 rubles. And Mintrud considers it expedient to 
establish the rate for the first grade at a level of 21,000. 
  The main question is: Will the new minimum wage, if it is 
adopted in this form, improve the position of those who are 
inadequately provided for? In order to answer, let us recall 
that, according to data of the Russia's Goskomstat [State 
Committee for Statistics], the subsistence minimum, which is 
calculated according to what just barely makes ends meet, was 
58,000 for the able bodied Russian in January. In March, 
according to my calculations, this minimum, in line with the 
rise in prices, will increase to 78,000 rubles. Thus the new 
minimum wage will be about a quarter of the subsistence minimum. 
Moreover, if one takes not the whole subsistence minimum, but 
only the most meager collection of food products necessary for 
survival (39,400 in January, 53,000 in March), then the new 
minimum wage in March will be enough for a very meager diet for 
only 12 days. The question is: How to live through the remaining 
18 days? 
  Incidentally, this is not the first year in Russia that 
the minimum wage has been completely separated from reality. 
This is nothing new. What is surprising is that the gap between 
the minimum wage and the subsistence minimum, despite widely 
circulated statements of Mintrud, is not being reduced but 
increased. From 1 December of last year, when, by an edict of 
the president of the Russian Federation [RF], the minimum 
remuneration for labor was increased to 14,620 rubles, prices 
rose--in December by 13 percent and in January by 21.3 percent; 
and in February, according to preliminary estimates, they will 
rise by 16 to 18 percent. THUS FOR THE THREE MONTHS PRICES WILL 
GO UP 1.59 TO 1.62 TIMES, BUT MINTRUD IS PROPOSING TO INCREASE 
THE MINIMUM WAGE BY ONLY 1.4 TIMES--that is, to still further 
separate it from real requirements. 
  I remind you: The amount of the minimum wage is the 
determinant of the level of most socially guaranteed 
payments--benefits, stipends, etc. Is further lowering of the 
standard of living admissible, when today 52.6 million Russians 
(according to January data) had an average per capita income 
below the subsistence minimum, and for 26.3 million citizens (or 
one out of every five!) this income was less than the value of 
the collection of food products necessary for survival. In other 
words, 26 MILLION RUSSIANS ARE LIVING HALF STARVED. 
Does Minister of Labor Gennadiy Melikyan understand what the 
threat to the country is of further "pressure" on people who 
have already been pushed to the limit? 
  It is true that, with respect to the budget sphere, Mintrud 
is nevertheless proposing to establish supplementary increases 
to the rates for the first, second, third and fourth grades in 
order to at least to some degree raise the miserly wage. But 
even with the supplementary increases, the new March wage for 
these workers will fall substantially short of the "products 
minimum." 
  This miserly "handout" will be extended to many "budget 
workers"--secretaries, typists, cashiers, draftsmen, 
bookkeepers, file clerks, clerks, workers in photo labs, records 
managers, workers in copying and duplicating offices, nurses 
aids, hospital attendants, and other workers whose positions and 
categories fall into grades 2 through 4. Mintrud has set for 
them payments (together with supplementary increases) of less 
than 45,000 rubles a month. 
  Will it be possible to survive more or less decently on a 
wage of 35,000 to 45,000? In a number of regions, evidently, 
these amounts will permit people to keep themselves "afloat," 
for example, in the Ulyanovsk, Belgorod, Tula, Orlovo, Smolensk, 
Voronezh, and Penza oblasts, where the subsistence minimum, if 
one believes Russia's Goskomstat, did not exceed 30,000 rubles 
in January. But in most territories, the humiliating amounts 
that are conventionally called "a wage" are only heating up the 
social atmosphere in society. 
  In my opinion, the practice of approving a single minimum 
wage and rate for the first grade for the entire country is in 
principle mistaken. This can only be an accounting indicator. 
Each region should have its own minimum wage, linked in 
specified proportions to the local subsistence minimum, 
gradually approaching it so that in one and a half to two years 
they will be equal. 
  Simultaneously with the proposals for the minimum wage, 
Mintrud has finally prepared and sent to the White House a draft 
law on the subsistence minimum in the Russian Federation. It is 
stipulated in the draft that the government should determine the 
relationships between the amount of the minimum wage and of 
workers' pensions, and the size of the subsistence minimum of 
the corresponding social-demographic groups of the population. 
  Let us assume that in 1994 the minimum wage will be 50 
to 60 percent of the subsistence minimum, in 1995--80 percent, 
and that in 1996 the minimum wage will equal the subsistence 
minimum. These figures are not in the draft; the relationships 
must still be determined if the law is adopted. 
  The emphasis in the draft is also on extending to those who 
are inadequately provided for specifically targeted social 
assistance in kind or in value form (through the resources of 
the subjects of the Federation). 
  But what seems absolutely unacceptable is the item in the 
draft stipulating that Mintrud of the RF will approve the size 
of the subsistence minimum. Not the government, not the State 
Duma, but precisely that department that has been the object of 
serious complaints in the area of social policy. This is a risky 
experiment.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "`Choice' Chooses the Most </F>
Drastic"] 
  [Text] We have learned from sources close to Russia's 
Choice about intensive consultations between Yegor Gaydar, who 
has quit the government, and the leaders of the so-called free 
trade unions. The first summit took place last Friday; the 
second is scheduled for the end of this week. Yegor Timurovich 
is proposing to the trade union leaders cooperation with the 
"strict political structure" that he is forming on the basis of 
Russia's Choice. The structuring of the party-trade union bloc 
is to have been completed by March, before the elections to the 
local representative organs of power. 
  The free trade unions (the Independent Miners' Union, 
Federation of Air-Traffic Controller Unions, SOTSPROF 
[Association of Socialist Trade Unions], and others) are 
considered democratic and oriented toward market reforms. One of 
their particular features is their relatively high strike 
activity, despite their relatively small numbers. The miners and 
air-traffic controllers are striking or declaring a state of 
pre-strike readiness almost continuously. 
  The news that the chief "Russia's Choicer" was formalizing 
an 
alliance with the most restless union organizations has 
coincided with talk about a "general political strike," which 
could erupt in the spring. The first to warn the head of the 
government of this was the newspaper IZVESTIYA. Then Mikhail 
Poltoranin mentioned a "general political strike." The hard-line 
political statement of the Independent Miners Union in 
connection with Gaydar's resignation was then noticed. 
  All this could be interpreted as some Freudian slips 
indicating either the subconscious desires or the deliberate 
plans of the democrats. Can they, who have hitherto accused 
their "Red-brown" opponents of the instigation of social 
conflicts, have now been engaging in this themselves? 
  Opinions on this score vary. Aman Tuleyev, representing in 
the Federation Council the region where the Russian strike 
movement was conceived, believes this to be the case: "Russia's 
Choice will now heat up the political situation in order to 
clear out its opponents in the government. `Choice' and other 
democrats have direct contacts with the Independent Miners 
Union. Last December the miners were visited not only by 
Gaydar--Sobchak, Denisenko, and others spent days and nights 
with them. Several mines are already `laid up' with us 
today--this is simply not being reported. Political demands--the 
resignation of the government--are airily being added to the 
economic demands." 
  "Senator" Tuleyev did not discern anything good in the 
intentions of the Russian democrats earlier either, and for this 
reason it is hard to call him an "entirely trustworthy source." 
Dmitriy Semenov, cochairman of the SOTSPROF, for example, 
considers the prospect of a political strike unrealistic: "I do 
not believe in a general strike--the people are not yet ready 
for this. A strike on political grounds in support of the policy 
of the departed Gaydar is even less likely. Of the trade unions, 
only the miners and the Federation of Air-Traffic Controller 
Unions could agree to this. The SOTSPROF Coordinating Council 
could `assign to the strike' certain branches of our union, but 
we would most likely not do so, lest we put our own people in 
jeopardy. No democrat has appealed to us with hints even of the 
desirability of a strike. Perhaps they have appealed to the 
miners or air-traffic controllers." 
  Some common denominator shows through in these largely 
opposite opinions, however. The radical section of Russia's 
Choice is now, evidently, predisposed toward risky decisions. 
Both in September-October of last year and at preceding "pivotal 
moments," the democrats were strong precisely by virtue of their 
radical approach and their egress from the system into a 
meta-system--beyond the framework of rules, beyond the 
"constitutional field." And from their viewpoint a strike is 
beneficial--the president would then be forced to take emergency 
steps, in the course of which the "government of Red managers" 
and the intractable Duma would be sidelined politically, and the 
actions of the radical democrats themselves would increase. 
  But the "Russia's Choicers" are pragmatists, and while 
keeping in mind the strike potentialities of the independent 
unions, they are nonetheless assigning them a different 
role--not so much the organizer of upheavals as the medium of an 
increase in their electorate. Here their interests interface 
with those of the union upper stratum. 
  According to confidential information in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's 
possession, the union leaders want for an alliance with "Choice" 
to obtain ministerial positions in a future government. This 
plan presupposes the early dissolution of the Duma and new 
parliamentary elections. 
  The moderate scenario of a "revanche of the democrats" not 
specifying the need for a general rebellion is, from the 
viewpoint of the union bosses, preferable. Not only in that it 
guarantees them ministerial office, but also in that it promises 
their organizations an appreciable gain in political weight and 
respectability in a "linkage" with the future "Gaydar party."

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ukolov: "Financial Dispute"] </F>
  [Text] The reorganization of the Social Insurance 
Fund in connection with the transfer of control over the fund to 
the state was hotly debated by representatives of trade unions 
and the government at the last meeting of the FNPR [Federation 
of Independent Trade Unions of Russia--FITUR] General Council. 
Oddly enough, both sides used the same argument: both insisted 
that their only aim was the protection of the interests of the 
laboring public, but for some reason they could not reach an 
agreement. Something else was also odd: the laboring public 
itself probably does not even know that such heated battles are 
being fought on its behalf and in its defense. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA decided to rectify this incongruity. 
The editors are not only informing their readers of the plans 
for the Social Insurance Fund, but also wish to hear their 
thoughts on the matter. Let us discuss this vitally important 
topic ourselves. 
<H3>  One Person Will Hold the Reins--What Could Be Wrong with 
That?... (Opinion of Yuriy Shatyrenko, chairman of Social 
Insurance Fund) </H3>
  It is a fait accompli: the management of social insurance 
has 
been taken out of the hands of the trade unions and turned over 
to the government by presidential edict. Some people feel that 
this was done in retaliation for the position the FITUR took 
during the October events. I think it is only a coincidence, 
although it is possible to see a natural sequence here. All of 
this, however, is already history. 
  Now we have to decide what state management will entail. 
Above all, it will entail some kind of hierarchical structure 
with a clearly defined, vertical chain of command. The edict 
said that the government would manage social insurance in 
conjunction with the all-Russian associations of trade unions. 
This means that they will be represented in the collegial bodies 
included in this precise state structure. 
  Therefore, the fund is now managed by a single 
individual--the chairman, who will have jurisdiction over all 
other administrators: the chairmen or managers of regional, 
sectorial, and other divisions and branches. The chairmen and 
managers on each level will have boards or coordinating 
councils, made up of representatives of various requisite state 
institutions (such as, for example, the tax service, labor 
agencies, financial institutions, and employers) and also, of 
course, the trade unions. 
  Now we have to decide the degree of trade-union 
participation. There are now 90 of them in Russia, and all of 
them want to have a say in the management of social insurance. 
As the saying goes, the number of opinions is equal to the 
number of individuals. Just try to coordinate all of these views! 
  The board will have fairly broad powers. It will discuss the 
draft budget, hear reports on the budget execution and, in 
general, discuss all of the most important aspects of the work 
of the Social Insurance Fund on the appropriate levels. The 
board will not be able, however, to make any decisions 
independently, because all directives will be based on the 
orders and instructions of the chairman. If the board and the 
chairman should disagree, the administrator will have the usual 
five days to report the disagreement to a superior organization, 
and this organization's decision will then be final. At the 
highest level, the federal one, if I, as the present chairman of 
the fund, disagree with its board, I will have five days to 
report this to the government, and then it will have the final 
say. There is no question that these incidents will be rare, 
because common sense will prevail in most cases. 
  Unfortunately, it was impossible to reach an agreement on 
this point with the trade unions. They are insisting that the 
fund should be under group management and that all decisions 
should be made by the board. This is the most fundamental 
difference of opinion. 
  The government was the "arbiter" in this case. Members of 
the 
government reviewed the matter and decided that a single manager 
would be preferable. 
  After all, just think what would happen if the heads of the 
coal workers' and petroleum workers' unions--V. Budko and A. 
Sergeyev--were both on the board. They never agree on anything, 
and simply because they do not like each other. They do not even 
place much importance on the public interest. Therefore, we 
should agree that today, because there is no unity in the labor 
movement, we need what might be described as the 
commanding-officer method of decisionmaking. It is possible that 
a move to more democratic principles of management might be 
considered in the future, when things are calmer and when large 
associations of trade unions have been established. 
  As far as the numerical representation of the trade unions 
on 
the board is concerned, it is possible that it should be 
increased, but exactly what good would this do? The whole 
purpose is to let all of the unions participate in the 
management of the fund, so that they can see where the money is 
being spent and how the interests of the laboring public or a 
particular branch or occupation are being protected. For this 
reason, let the trade unions take turns on the board. 
  This would work on the federal level. On the sectorial 
level, 
however, things can be much simpler: if there is a sectorial 
division of, for instance, railroad workers, a representative of 
the railroad workers will always serve on the board, without any 
kind of rotation. On the regional level, proportional 
representation will depend on the leading branches in the region. 
  We have agreed not to get rid of anything that exists and 
works today. All of it will remain in place until a law on 
social insurance has been passed. The other possibilities of 
social insurance will be used in the sphere of public health. We 
are not excluding the possibility of supplemental systems and 
are prepared to promote this with the offer of procedural 
assistance, money, buildings, etc. The present system of social 
insurance, based on the deduction of 5.4 percent of total wages, 
provides all employed individuals with only minimum guarantees: 
for the person who loses his salary because of disability, for 
the woman who loses her salary because of pregnancy or 
maternity.... If trade unions wish to become more active and 
offer some kind of additional support, we will help them do this 
and we certainly will not interfere in their affairs. 
  There was another point on which we disagreed with the trade 
unions. They insist on written confirmation that the money in 
the Social Insurance Fund is their property. I do not agree: 
this is state money. This is an ordinary tax, just like the 
income tax or value-added tax. If the state wished, it could 
liquidate our fund and combine it with, for instance, the 
pension fund. If it wished, it could raise or lower the rate of 
deduction. The fund is a purely financial organization which 
collected money according to a specific rate of deduction and is 
distributing the money for specific purposes. It should not do 
anything else with the money. 
<H3>  But What About the Trade Unions--Will They Only Get a Seat 
at the Corner of the Table? (Opinion of Vyacheslav Goncharov, 
deputy chairman of FITUR) </H3>
  The future of the Social Insurance Fund is still arousing 
great anxiety in our trade-union organizations and labor 
collectives, and not because something is being taken away from 
us, as people in the government have implied. We are aware of 
all of the responsibility required for the performance of the 
only services that could have kept the system working flawlessly 
for many years. The trade unions will continue to be responsible 
for them by presidential edict. 
  I want to say right away that we are willing to work with 
state agencies and share the responsibility with them in matters 
pertaining to the improvement of social insurance. Questions and 
objections arise, in my opinion, because the trade unions were 
not consulted before the management of the fund was turned over 
to the state. 
  I want to stress that the FITUR is ready and willing for 
dialogue and for the planning and execution of joint actions 
with the government and employers on the basis of a social 
partnership. 
  I do not want to overdramatize the situation, but 
reciprocity 
is clearly lacking in this process. We do have certain proposals 
which the new management of the fund did not accept, and we 
intend to take them straight to the government and defend their 
validity. 
  I will discuss them in greater detail. First of all, there 
is 
the whole structure of fund management. Regrettably, there is no 
group management in this structure. The new board will play a 
strictly advisory role, and the representation of trade unions 
on the board will be confined to the bare minimum. What is the 
point of discussing the presence or absence of agreement among 
trade unions now that the FITUR unites almost 92 percent of all 
workers? Obviously, the representation of the FNPR should be 
commensurate with this, and the present number of seats for 
trade unions (7 of the 25) is clearly inadequate. 
  We cannot arrive at a common denominator with the 
"statesmen" 
in the argument over the ownership of the money controlled by 
the fund. They tell us that it is theirs--the state's, but we 
feel that this is the people's money and that it should belong 
to the Social Insurance Fund. After all, we know that the budget 
on the federal level, and especially on the regional level, is 
bursting at the seams. If we do not defend our position, there 
could be all kinds of fights over these resources--representing 
5.4 percent of total wages. 
  How can the money be used prudently? In addition to the 
funds 
used for the designated purpose, a small portion should be 
allocated for the maintenance of athletic training schools for 
children and young adults. Otherwise, we might forfeit the 
money, along with the healthy childhood of the little Russians 
for whose sake our people are willing to endure all of their 
difficulties. 
  Medical services also require financial support--perhaps not 
all services, but prosthetics, post-traumatic care, and rare and 
complex treatments and operations certainly require some money 
from the Social Insurance Fund. 
  Besides this, we are naturally concerned about the financing 
of technical and legal inspections instituted by trade unions 
and the salaries of our physicians: not so much because they are 
working under the union banner, but because we have a system--a 
system that works!--and it would be wrong to demolish it. After 
all, demolition is not a necessary stage of the construction 
process. 
  At this time of transition, the trade unions suggest a 
constructive compromise: the fund budget could be divided into 
two parts. The first could be used for payments for social 
guarantees, and it could be managed by directly related agencies 
of the executive branch of government and by economic 
structures. The influence of trade unions could be confined to a 
minimum in this sphere. The other part of the budget, however, 
could be used for public health (the 19.4 percent allocated for 
the network of health resorts and 1 percent for the athletic 
schools for children and young adults), and this portion should 
be managed by trade unions on all levels and various Russian 
associations because we own the material base of this health 
network. 
  We can guarantee that the new board of the Social Insurance 
Fund can expect nothing but the gratitude of the public if it 
agrees to this compromise. 
<H5>  After the Presses Started Rolling </H5>
  A few days ago the leaders of trade-union associations 
belonging to the FITUR and the so-called "parallel" associations 
gathered in the Palace of Labor in Moscow, as if in response to 
an alarm. There was good reason to sound the alarm: the new 
board of the Social Insurance Fund (now a state fund) forgot 
about President B.N. Yeltsin's instructions to work with the 
trade unions, ordered the liquidation of some central sectorial 
divisions, tried to seize their assets, and is even taking aim 
at the trade-union health and vacation resorts. 
  These steps aroused understandable indignation, but 
will it produce any tangible results? 
  In this context, we are reminded of the old Russian 
saying about the masters of insincere rhetoric: "Their tongues 
are coated with honey...."

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Sergeyev, chairman of Russia's </F>
Independent Trade Union of Miners, by Tatyana Skorobogatko, 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI columnist; date and place not given: 
"Aleksandr Sergeyev: Tatyana Skorobogatko, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI 
Columnist, Talks With Aleksandr Sergeyev, Chairman of Russia's 
Independent Trade Union of Miners"] 
  [Text] The "left" and "right" are forecasting that "popular 
unrest" will sweep away Chernomyrdin's cabinet. They are 
assigning the detonator role for the social explosion to miners 
who have been combat-ready for a long time. In September, the 
Independent Trade Union of Coal Industry Workers conducted a 
strike; in November-December -- the Independent Trade Union of 
Miners. The miners' main demands are immutable. However, 
Aleksandr Sergeyev is convinced that a "nomenklatura-managerial 
trade union" of coal miners provokes inflation and that a "free 
trade union" of miners protects the course of the reforms. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Can one and the same demand be 
pro-market and anti-market depending on who proposes it? 
  [Sergeyev] The demands are different. The coal miners' trade 
union is insisting that the debts owed to the miners be repaid 
at any cost. One demand is preferential extension of credit to 
enterprises using coal. Supposedly, they will then pay off the 
mines. This means throwing tens of trillions more of "empty" 
rubles into the economy. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you think that it is better not to 
pay debts, generally speaking? 
  [Sergeyev] No, the state should pay the subsidies pledged in 
the 1993 budget. However, it is not obligatory that money should 
be printed for this purpose. The mines are now paying taxes into 
the budget and then receiving subsidies. Let the mines be 
"excused" from taxes and deductions for the employment and 
pension funds in the amount which they have not been paid in the 
form of subsidies. 
  However, subsidies are approximately a third of what the 
miners are "short;" the remainder are the debts of the user. It 
is necessary to seek a declaration of bankruptcy through the 
courts for enterprises that cannot pay for the coal. In June of 
last year prior to the introduction of unregulated prices for 
coal, these prices were 30 percent of world ones. Metallurgy 
moved to the world price of metal using cheap coal. That means 
that they set the production cost of its products too high and 
that they raised wages for themselves at the expense of our 
coal's cheap price. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Are you not afraid that workers in 
other branches will accuse you of trying to worsen their 
condition with your demands? 
  [Sergeyev] We have conflicts with all trade unions. They say 
that we are "pro-government" and are being supported by state 
money. Only one thing cannot be understood: Why are we living in 
such "luxury" -- a headquarters consisting of one room? 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI comment] The leaders of the "miners" 
constantly emphasize that its trade union rival, which is 
"genetically linked with the VTsSPS [All-Union Central Council 
of Trade Unions]," is not a genuine one since representatives of 
the administration are included in it. They are convinced that a 
"managerial trade union" is not capable of truly defending 
worker interests. In turn, the "coal miners" accuse the NPG 
[Independent Trade Union of Miners] of splitting the worker 
movement. They assume that the disintegration of a single 
miners' trade union is a matter in the hands of the government, 
which is skillfully taking advantage of the trade union leaders' 
excessive ambitions. 
  The "coal miners" have approximately a million members -- 
practically all are workers in the branch. "Miners" represent 
only part of the underground workers -- approximately 80,000 
people. True, they have political capital earned during the 
initial period of the struggle for democracy. However, this 
capital is completely counterbalanced today by the authority of 
the "defenders of worker interests," who acquired the "old" 
trade union during the transition to a market. Miners are living 
in an atmosphere of fear bordering on panic. There are chronic 
pay delays, prospects of massive unemployment, a lack of 
solutions for social and living problems. In this situation, the 
main mass of the miners will most likely come out in favor of a 
trade union which is able to achieve the largest concessions 
from the government. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] When the leaders of the "traditional" 
trade unions said that the government is acting without 
considering worker interests, you branded them "enemies of the 
reforms." Why have you always defended the government so 
vehemently? 
  [Sergeyev] We have not defended the government but the 
policy 
of reform. The "managerial" trade union was demanding money to 
preserve the old order; we -- to bring the coal industry into 
the market carefully and not "throw it into it." 
  What do we have? First of all, they adopted an edict about 
issuing joint stock for the branch's enterprises although it is 
clear that the shares of stock are blank paper: They will close 
the mines. It was necessary to begin with a program for 
structurally reorganizing the branch and providing measures for 
miners let go. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Why did the reform government not 
listen to your completely reformist demands? 
  [Sergeyev] There never was any reform government. It was a 
coalition where lobbying interests fought. Each fall, miners, 
oil workers and then others "stood up." All were demanding money 
and it was given to everyone. During the two years, the 
government did not develop a strategy or tactics for 
reorganizing the economy. The directorate and the Moscow 
bureaucrats adapted and built a market for themselves. 
  I do not know whether an auditing firm capable of inspecting 
Rosugol and other large corporations will be found in Russia. 
When World Bank experts were studying Rosugol's activity, it 
refused to give them part of the information, citing commercial 
secrets. Almost all coal associations are bankrupt but Rosugol 
is a highly profitable company. It not only distributes state 
subsidies between associations but also provides them paid 
services for equipment purchases, marketing, etc. The 
bureaucrats in Moscow are living better than the miners. The 
directors of the associations do not protest. Certain units are 
trying to break away from the guardianship of the corporation. 
However, they often ask to return because it begins to choke 
them deliberately -- with high taxes and through the 
distribution of subsidies. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI comment] One cannot say that the 
authorities have ignored the Independent Trade Union of Miners. 
Its leaders have been well received in many high offices and 
have rubbed shoulders with State Secretary Burbulis and many 
vice premiers without ceremony. However, the fate of the 
proposals proposed by them differed little from the fate of the 
demands by the "VTsSPS successors:" The majority of the 
government's promises have remained on paper. The protocol, 
which Yegor Gaydar himself signed in December under the threat 
of a Russia-wide miners' strike, is not being implemented. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Perhaps, the government completely 
fulfilled a miners' demand only once: It raised their wages 
threefold in January 1992. 
  [Sergeyev] That decision was provoked by the miners' trade 
union and the branch ministry. It was they who achieved an 
increase in wages for all branch workers, including nurses in 
the departments' kindergartens. A surge in inflation occurred -- 
they shifted the blame to the miners. I do not want the miners 
to be the "extreme" ones again and that is why I am criticizing 
the "coal miners" for issuing money. One only had to raise the 
pay of the underground group of workers in 1992. Gaydar later 
explained to me why they increased it for everyone: "We thought 
that `they' were you," that is, they thought that this trade 
union is also a workers' movement and that its leaders are 
capable of organizing strikes. I think that the government 
demonstrated incompetency at that time -- although some say that 
Yeltsin paid off the miners this way or that he was thanking 
them for bringing him to power. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you intend to engage actively in 
politics as before or is this not a trade union matter? 
  [Sergeyev] It is a trade union one -- until the NPG program 
adopted at the founding congress is changed. It is written in it 
that the trade union of hired workers must engage in politics 
during the transitional period. Since last spring, we have eased 
our political activity because the lads in the local areas have 
shouted: Enough politics; busy yourselves with the economy! Here 
is the result: They have quite ceased to consider us. Of course, 
not all of us have acted correctly. The demands to remove 
someone from the government or to keep some figure or other in 
it were wrong. However, if the government sharply changes 
course, we should intervene. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] By participating in politics, the 
miners have often become a toy in somebody else's hands. Is this 
not annoying? 
  [Sergeyev] It is annoying, it is not annoying.... All is 
natural: As long as the worker movement is uncoordinated, 
politicians easily use the ambitions of local leaders for their 
own purposes. I think that we have now overcome the sickness of 
growth. It is more complicated to toy with us. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you consider the situation to be an 
extremely explosive one? 
  [Sergeyev] A spontaneous "creeping" strike is taking place: 
one mine stops, then another. The transfer of state subsidies to 
some mines has been stopped although nothing officially has been 
declared about their closing. The people are scattering. The 
government is hoping that if it "forces out" people in small 
doses, there will be no massive explosion. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Therefore, has the time for a 
Russia-wide miners' strike passed? Who will risk going on strike 
if there is massive unemployment? 
  [Sergeyev] Many are already afraid now. Moreover, the 
regional differences in the miners' situation are too great. 
They will intensify with the market's development. That is why I 
think that the time for Russia-wide strikes, if it has not 
passed, is coming to an end. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI comment] The leaders of the miners have 
always called the ability to organize a strike one of the 
criteria for the trade union's "truth" -- however, not a 
"managerial" strike with the agreement of the enterprise 
director. In Sergeyev's opinion, the miners' trade union is 
acting this way. The NPG has become accustomed to taking pride 
in the fact that it can "organize" the miners of an entire 
region and then halt a strike in an organized manner. This is 
more difficult than starting one. They also can wreck a strike 
by the competing trade union. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Are you still capable of influencing 
the course of strikes? They began spontaneously in January and 
could not be stopped in an organized manner. 
  [Sergeyev] We really were forced in November to follow 
events. Workers and their wives came to the miners' leaders in 
Vorkuta: "We have not been paid for two months -- there is 
nothing to feed our children with. Either do something or we 
will destroy the administration." They went on a hunger-strike 
and called me. We immediately called a council of 
representatives. They decided to give the government a month. 
Incidentally, it was very easy at the time to "organize" the 
Kuzbass also. I immediately ran for deputy to the State Duma 
from the Prokopyevskiy Territorial Okrug. Speaking on 
television, I could have called for a strike. I did not do this. 
However, I spoke with Gaydar by telephone in advance and 
demanded that he sign the protocol. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] In September, you criticized "that" 
trade union for the "inopportuneness" of the strike, saying that 
it was playing into the opposition's hands. However, they 
themselves went on strike on the eve of the elections. One 
democratic newspaper even accused you of engaging in blackmail 
of the government, implementing a social directive of the 
anti-reform forces. 
  [Sergeyev] Every day, a mine now stops. This means that we 
correctly warned the government about the danger. Why does no 
one want to admit guilt but looks for scapegoats? 
  Does this mean that we already do not need the democrats who 
were brought to power? Incidentally, Russia's Choice waged a 
propaganda campaign against me during the election campaign. 
Everyone played the "miners' card." However, who was thinking 
about our interests? We were compelled to make the government 
think about the miners' fate by force. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] And if it refuses to implement the 
December protocol? 
  [Sergeyev] We will begin to unleash collective actions. We 
will possibly even make up a train from Vorkuta and will drive 
here. We will picket even the Kremlin. There are enough forces. 
  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI Dossier 
  Aleksandr Sergeyev was born on 5 August 1960 in a suburb of 
Mezhdurechensk (Kemerovo Oblast). He completed the metallurgical 
institute in Novokuznetsk in the mining engineer-electrician 
specialty. After serving in the army, he worked in the 
Mezhdurechensk mines as a mine foreman, mechanic and electric 
metal worker. In July 1989 during the miners' strikes, he was 
elected to the city and oblast worker committees and to the 
oblast strike committee. Since then, he has been a professional 
figure in the worker movement. At the All-Union Congress of 
Miners in November 1990, he was elected deputy chairman of the 
executive bureau of the USSR Independent Trade Union of Miners 
which was being founded at the time. He has headed Russia's 
Independent Trade Union of Miners since November 1991. 
  He is married with an eight-year-old daughter and 
three-year-old son. He moved his family from Mezhdurechensk to 
Moscow several months ago although he has worked in the capital 
for three years. He rents an apartment. Previously he took a 
great interest in volley ball and playing the guitar. During the 
last five years he has had no hobby -- "only work."

"Lefortovo Prison Comes Under Ministry of Interior"; first 
paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment] 
  [Text] By the president's decree on the abolition of 
the Security Ministry, the prison cells and the investigation 
department of Lefortovo are being placed in charge of the 
Ministry of the Interior (MVD). The investigators, including 
those holding an inquiry into the October events of 1993 in 
Moscow, were advised to turn over their duties in ten days. 
  It is well known the main oppositionists from the White 
House 
are not the only prisoners in Lefortovo. Also conducted in this 
prison are serious investigations of smuggling, corruption and 
narcobusiness. These are hundreds of bulky cases, numerous 
material evidence and valuables, and stacks of classified 
material. According to investigators, only the regular checking 
of classified and non-classified documents usually takes 30-35 
days. If the transfer of Lefortovo to MVD is speeded up, it is 
quite possible that many case files may be lost in this chaos. 
  The Lefortovo employees do not conceal their concern and 
embarrassment. Their fate is not yet clear. The investigation of 
all cases has been suspended. The persons under investigation as 
well as officers are waiting for a decision of their destiny. It 
is still not clear to whom the material values confiscated from 
those arrested will be handed over to. The Main Military 
Procurator's Office seems to have voiced its readiness to assume 
responsibility for a part of the cases, but the question was: 
Who will investigate them. It has enough problems of its own. 
All the members of the investigation team inquiring into the 
October events have been dismissed. Their vague future and the 
absence of distinct explanations make the investigators assume 
that the abolition of the Security Ministry is a convenient 
pretext for making corrections to the "October case." An MN 
[MOSCOW NEWS] correspondent was told at Lefortovo that from the 
first day the president's entourage was dissatisfied with the 
investigation team. It was made clear what kind of results were 
expected from it. Investigators were compelled to hold a meeting 
and demand that they be protected against the pressure of the 
interested sides. 
  Nevertheless, from early November the investigation team was 
kept in a state of temporary "time trouble": at the meetings in 
the General Procurator's Office its members are hastened, then 
the president set the task of taking the matters to court before 
the New Year. Investigators believe that this is a direct 
interference in judicial procedures and fear that in the process 
of the transfer of the cases the materials they had obtained may 
be sifted through the "political sieve." 
  Of late it became known that several investigators of the 
General Procurator's Office handed in a request to Alexei 
Kazannik to release them from the cases on October events 
because of pressure they are subjected to from the officials of 
the president's staff. And from January 1 the Defense Ministry 
stopped financing military courts (tribunals) which were 
supposed to plead the cases of Rutskoi, Achalov, Barannikov, 
Dunayev and others. Added to this the rumors on the forthcoming 
dissolution of the General Procurator's Office, we shall have a 
strange chain.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Nekrasov, member of the Criminology </F>
Association, under the heading "Business under the 
Criminological X-Ray": "Let He Who Speaks Be Heard"] 
  [Text] Let us ask, as they say, a point-blank question: Has 
the Criminology Association, which organized the international 
seminar "For Honest Business" at the beginning of January, 
succeeded in its undertaking? Did they not waste the first work 
week of the year--scholars and practitioners in jurisprudence, 
staff of various protection services, and finally, 
entrepreneurs, who, as one may guess, have an extremely high 
stake in this--by gathering in the conference hall of the 
Russian Academy of Management? 
  Of course, skeptics will also have something to comment on 
in 
the seminar. First, the thesis "two jurists--three opinions" has 
not been refuted by a long shot. Differences of opinion 
sometimes produced a heat akin to rally frenzy. Second, is there 
a guarantee that in this debate, contrary to the experience of 
thousands of others like it, the truth indeed will be born? 
Finally, was it worthwhile to convene this gathering in order to 
once again state the obvious: business is being overrun by crime? 
  As an objection to the hypothetical skeptic, I will probably 
begin with the latter: stating the obvious. There are different 
ways to state things. One can stun the audience with murderous 
(frequently in the literal sense) statistics and "finish off" 
the listener with the eternal question: What are they doing 
about it--the procuracy, or the militia, or anyone else except 
the critic's own agency. Or one may calmly present the same 
figures on the basis of a scientifically validated analysis. One 
can, on the basis of the same analysis, produce a clear 
forecast; or, finally, propose a package of well-considered 
measures. 
  For the sake of fairness I want to say that this approach 
was 
the prevalent one. Thanks to a large extent to the fact that the 
presidium, headed by the association President Azaliya 
Dolgovaya, tactfully but firmly nipped attempts at rally style 
in the bud. 
  Now the main point. Despite the divergence of opinions that 
is traditional for the legal profession, the seminar 
participants practically agreed on the definition of three, if 
one may put it this way, "predicaments" of modern business in 
our country. A useless legal base of reforms; obvious 
shortcomings in the practice of privatization, banking, and 
other strategic directions of economic renewal; and finally, a 
corrupt bureaucracy--this is what accompanies the current, to 
put it mildly, adverse situation. A special topic was the hasty 
and unreasoned reform of the law enforcement system. Does this 
mean then that the seminar was a complete success? 
  I would wait before answering this. I would wait, despite 
being fully convinced that this seminar was necessary, despite 
all the respect for the work the organizers have put into it. 
One will be able to call it a success only when the alarms rung 
by criminologists are heard in the power structures; when people 
who do professional research in criminology are brought into 
norm-creating work (which, I should note, in civilized countries 
is altogether unthinkable without the expert opinion of 
criminologists). 
  As to the discussion at the seminar per se, today we are 
publishing its principal sections. We are publishing it, of 
course, without smoothing out the sharp aspects in the dialogue, 
without retouching the sometimes polarized viewpoints. Despite 
all this, we hope that the reader will get an objective picture 
of not only the proceedings at the seminar, but also (and this 
is most important) an idea of the crime situation in the sphere 
of business.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Forecast Is For Foul Weather </F>
(From the Theses Prepared for the Criminology Association 
Seminar)"] 
  [Text] The past few years have been characterized by an 
unprecedented growth in crime, changes in its characteristics, 
and for all practical purposes the loss of state and public 
control over the crime situation. 
  During 1990-1992 the absolute increase in the number of 
recorded crimes more than doubled annually: In 1990 it increased 
by 14 percent; in 1991--by 34 percent; and in 1992--by 17 
percent. This trend continued in 1993. Of special notice is the 
increase in aggravated crime (34 percent). 
  There has been a sharp increase in the number of crimes 
committed with firearms and in drug-related crimes. 
  Crime has acquired new qualitative characteristics: It is 
now 
better armed, and its organized nature and criminal 
professionalism have increased. According to MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] operational data, 4,352 organized criminal 
groups were identified in 1992 (5.5 times more than in 1990), 15 
percent of which had corrupt and 23 percent interregional 
connections. More than 800 organized crime groups were watched 
by units for combating contraband and corruption of the Russian 
Ministry of Security. More than 40 international smuggling crime 
groups have been identified. More than 130 "Russian" stores 
selling Russian antiques have been found abroad. 
  Organized crime families operate in the sphere of 
privatization, conversion to joint-stock holding, financial and 
credit relations, and exchange activities. The drug business is 
actively developing in Russia. Officials--including those with 
responsibility for developing the state's political and economic 
ties and implementing long-term programs of international 
cooperation--working in Russian organizations abroad are being 
actively drawn into smuggling and other criminal activities. 
  Criminological research shows that official crime data 
reflect less and less the real criminal situation in Russia. 
Even grave crimes endangering life and health are reported 
increasingly less to law enforcement bodies--both by victims and 
medical facilities. 
  A decline in economic crime also is associated to a 
considerable degree with less information flowing to law 
enforcement organs. In the past they received a considerable 
amount of material from the system of people's control, the 
construction bank, trade inspection, and other control organs 
which now have either been liquidated or substantially 
reorganized. In addition, a considerable number of criminal 
actions in the economic sphere involves the private sector, 
which prefers not to let state organs meddle in it. As a result, 
there has been a steady decrease in recorded abuse of position, 
economic operations, and other crimes in the economic sphere: 
150,972 in 1991, 141,271 in 1991, and 127,085 in 1992. 
  Increasingly crimes remain unsolved. As compared to 1989 the 
number increased by 37 percent in 1990, by 74 percent in 1991, 
and by 101 percent in 1992. This indicates that the law 
enforcement system is working at the limit of its capacity. Many 
crimes will never be solved. The growing remainder of unsolved 
crimes as of 1 January 1993 amounted to more than 3 million. 
  Over the period 1989-1992 the number of staff members of 
internal affairs organs charged with crimes increased by a 
factor of 2.2, including those charged with abuse of official 
position and crimes against the law system--by a factor of 3.7. 
There were 3.4 times more crimes unmasked involving 
bribe-taking. In 1992, 1,641 members of internal affairs organs 
were charged with commission of general crimes (murder, theft, 
robbery, and so on), which is almost twice as many as in 1989. 
  Many criminals, even when identified, practically do not 
incur the penalty envisaged by law. With respect to identified 
thieves who have committed crimes through embezzlement, 
misappropriation of funds, or abuse of official position, 
charges have been brought against only about 30 percent; 5-6 
percent were sentenced to prison terms, and with respect to the 
overwhelming majority of bribe-takers the sentence that is 
handed down is below the lowest minimum. Such impunity 
contributes to a blossoming of corruption. 
  Many crimes and criminals end up out of bounds for law 
enforcement also because of the lower social-legal activism of 
the population, intimidation or bribery of victims and 
witnesses, unclear policy with respect to crime (for a long time 
a moratorium was advocated on combating economic crime during 
the period of transition to the market), extremely poor 
organization of inspection (audit) control, and the fact that 
the legal base for combating crime lags behind the changes in 
crime itself. Numerous forms of corrupt behavior (acceptance of 
invitations to foreign trips, receiving preferential credit, 
etc.) are far from always covered by provisions of current 
legislation. Criminal liability for organizing and running an 
organized crime family still has not been put in effect; there 
is no proper legal treatment for professional crime carried out 
in the form of unlicensed enterprise, and a number of other 
socially dangerous forms of behavior--financial transgressions, 
brokerage machinations of exchange dealers, setting up false 
enterprises, false bankruptcy, improper use of targeted credits, 
and other actions. 
  The real state of affairs with respect to crime and other no 
less socially dangerous phenomena is in reality worse by several 
orders of magnitude than that recorded by crime statistics. With 
the loss of control over crime, the state itself practically 
becomes criminal. It permits further enrichment of the criminal 
world. According to calculations of the Analytical Center of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, 55 percent of capital and 80 
percent of voting stock are shifting into the hands of criminal 
and foreign capital; in rare cases when charges of embezzlement 
of state and public property are prosecuted, only two-thirds of 
material damage is reimbursed. A considerable number of state 
and municipal employees are corrupt. 
  In the next few years we may expect a further increase in 
crime because of the increasing criminalization of juveniles and 
members of social groups of the population that were considered 
safe until the end of 1980's--researchers, military servicemen, 
and so on.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Petrovskaya: "Is the Last `Paragraph' at </F>
Hand?"] 
  [Text] I was called Tuesday evening by Boris Berman, the 
artistic director of the creative association Command-2. "Watch 
my program on 11 February," he requested. And he added sadly: 
"The last `Paragraph' is at hand." 
  That day the chairman of the All-Russian Television and 
Radio 
Company, Oleg Poptsov, informed the collective of a reduction 
and possibly even full cessation of all original broadcasting 
starting in March. Programs like Berman's "Paragraph," on which 
budgetary resources are expended, will go off the air. 
  The reason is trivial--the state does not have the money to 
maintain its own television. At a meeting with managers of 
state companies, S. Dubinin, acting minister of finance, 
officially announced a 50-percent reduction in their financing 
which, accordingly, will also lead to a reduction in the volume 
of programming by approximately one half. 
  I do not believe that the government does not have the 
money. 
Millions of dollars and billions of rubles [R] were found to 
restore the burned White House. It was ready to find $500 
million for the construction of a new parliamentary center. 
Until recently, various statesmen gave assurances that the money 
will also be found for television. 
  At the end of December, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin, 
while 
presenting the new manager, A. Yakovlev, to the board of 
directors of Ostankino, recognized the exceptional 
"significance" of the electronic resources of mass information 
and declared firmly: "We will support state TV no matter how 
difficult it might be. We are not really that poor." At that 
time the prime minister reported on the government's decision to 
allocate resources from the budget to pay the debts of the 
television and radio company to the Ministry of Communications. 
  It is February outside, but last year's debts have still not 
been paid. The communicators are threatening to strike. The 
companies are feverishly searching for a way out of the 
situation that has developed, having realized long ago: Saving 
the drowning is a matter for those who are drowning. 
  There is no big panic in Ostankino--they are developing 
scenarios there of the kind of economic structure in which no 
one will come off the loser. Moreover, Ostankino expends budget 
resources basically to pay for the services of the Ministry of 
Communications--independent companies conduct a majority of the 
programs with their own money. The concern of the first channel 
is only to invest it in its own air time. Very expensive 
advertising, which is through the roof on the first channel, 
makes it possible to pay for a few programs of Ostankino itself. 
Thus, no matter how much you curse the predominant influence of 
advertising on the screen, without it the number of programs 
would have been cut a long time ago--there would have been 
nothing with which to make them. 
  The situation of the second channel, the Russian channel, is 
far more difficult. Practically since its first days it has 
existed as a poor relative that is given crumbs from the grand 
table. The situation with equipment is bad, the accommodations 
are tight, there is less advertising, its cost is lower than 
Ostankino's, and you can count the number of independent 
producers on one hand--the main part of production has to be 
produced by the company itself. Russian TV [RTV] is filled up to 
the ears with promises: In almost three years, five government 
decrees were adopted concerning RTV. Not one of them has been 
implemented. 
  In the meantime, many RTV workers justly think that they 
deserve more attentive treatment for themselves on the part of 
the authorities: It was precisely Russian TV that in the most 
tense and most tragic moments of the life of the country 
demonstrated social and civic responsibility, placing the 
interests of the country and society above all else. 
  This, however, was appraised in a way. I had occasion to 
attend a meeting of Deputy Prime Minister V. Shumeyko with RTV 
immediately after the October events of last year. V. Shumeyko, 
on behalf of the government, thanked everyone for the selfless 
work on the night of 3-4 October, calling it a great deed. Oleg 
Poptsov then expressed the fear. He said, you are now thanking 
us, you promise manna from heaven, but will it not happen that 
after a month or two we will be forgotten once again? And we 
will once again come face to face with many of our problems? 
Shumeyko promised firmly not to forget, and presented the 
collective of the company a gift from the government--a mantle 
clock. "It would have been better if he had presented us a 
couple of extra microphones," remarked Sveta Sorokina, who was 
sitting next to me. 
  "Now this clock is ticking off the last minutes of the life 
of many programs that we will have to drop," Anatoliy Lysenko, 
RTV's general director, joked bitterly, telling me about the 
impending cut in broadcasting. The RTV collective is agitated: 
After cutting broadcasting, a cut in personnel is inevitable. 
  Given the total tragedy of the situation for those specific 
people whose programs will be canceled in the near future, it 
should be noted for the sake of objectivity: The programs of 
both channels required creative revision a long time ago. 
According to data of the Vs. Vilchek Service, the early morning 
and late night audiences cannot even be measured--there are 
practically none. It is also reasonable, in the opinion of many 
specialists, to have a daytime interval--ongoing daytime 
programs for business people also have a rating close to zero. 
Consequently, morning, day, and night segments can be cut 
without pain to the viewers when, really, there is not enough 
money. Of course, it would be nice if such a "revision" was 
conducted accurately and professionally--so that viewers' 
favorite programs would not suffer qualitatively. 
  Although, as is believed by the deputy chairman of the 
Federal TV and Radio Service of Russia, Valentin Lazutkin, 
quantitative economy will lead to nothing, and will hit the 
communicators first and foremost: The entire system of signal 
transmission devices was created for specific volumes of 
broadcasting. It is unrealistic, in his opinion, to give the 
freed capacities to "private owners": There are no strong 
nonstate broadcasters today who would be able to pay not only 
for the production of programs but also for their dissemination 
to cities and villages. In addition to all this, it is 
unprofitable to the state. What really unites the country? 
Television and radio. If the system of federal television and 
radio broadcasting breaks down--the country will also break 
down. This is what the people making decisions should realize, 
believes one of the main Russian television chiefs. 
  Is there a way out of the developing situation or a dead 
end? 
Have we arrived there? In my opinion, and in the opinion of many 
specialists, there is a way out. It is time finally for the 
state to determine--does it need its own television at all? If 
it is necessary, it should calculate how much television it is 
able to handle--after all, the problem of survival that the two 
major national companies have encountered is also facing oblast 
and regional companies. And they are all over Russia--90 of 
them! Without exception, all are on hunger rations, they are 
feeding only on promises, and they do not know what awaits them 
tomorrow. At the same time, it is always demanded of them to 
support and explain to people the policy of a government that 
wishes to order the music but stubbornly refuses to pay. 
  But all the rest of television that cannot be afforded--give 
it away. Owners will be found. What they will entertain the 
viewer with is another question. But a lit-up screen, in any 
case, is better than a blank one. We lived through this 
once--and there was nearly a complete "stop."

<F P=106> [Interview with Valentin Lazutkin, first deputy chairman of </F>
the Russian Federal Television and Radio Broadcasting Service, 
by Irina Petrovskaya, under the "Crisis" rubric: "We Have Been 
Ordered To Survive"] 
  [Text] I met with Valentin Lazutkin, first deputy 
chairman of the Russian Federal Television and Radio 
Broadcasting Service [FSR], on the day when television screens 
went blank in 60 regions of the country. Communications workers 
had carried out their threat and stopped transmission of 
television and radio broadcasts, demanding that state companies 
and the government pay their debt of 80 billion. The same day, 
Viktor Chernomyrdin firmly promised to pay the debts by the end 
of the first quarter and pleaded with the communications 
industry to resume transmission. The threat to be left without 
the favorite "boob tube" has receded. For how long? How is state 
television to live and survive in this extremely hard economic 
situation? 
  [Lazutkin] We have always thought that we had not yet hit 
the 
bottom. Today it is clear--this is the bottom. What can we count 
on? Only on radical political solutions. At this point the most 
unpopular and painful method was used--they took the money from 
some other sphere, where the house is not yet on fire, and gave 
it to television. Naturally, this is not going to solve the 
problem. 
  Of course, we now need to do full accounting, go through the 
entire chain of calculations. Optimists believe that 
restructuring of the economic mechanism of the federal 
television system may produce savings measured by a two-digit 
factor. This is a lot--two zeros are erased, by the way. But 
expert modern economic analysis will take time. 
  Not too many people know that the entire system of signal 
distribution rests on 8,500 retransmission stations. Can we 
dispense with ground stations and shift to satellite 
transmissions? Yes, but not before the year 2000. There is also 
a problem with satellites. Those that serve the Far East 
sometime by the spring will reach the end of their useful life 
and quietly die. In the past, there was a rule: One satellite is 
working; another is hanging nearby, just in case; and the third 
is on the ground, ready for launch. Alas, this situation no 
longer exists. Satellites are approaching the end of their 
utility, and there is no replacement for them on the ground. 
This is about television, but there also is radio. During 
COMECON times, radio stations were equipped with Hungarian 
equipment. Now all ties have been disrupted. There are no spare 
parts. So radio stations will also begin to crumble soon. 
Television centers are junkyards. Old equipment that keeps 
breaking down. In short, an enormous complex of problems. Today 
we felt it especially acutely, because everything went out at 
once. I can tell you one thing: This year is a year of survival 
for state television. 
  [Petrovskaya] But how can it survive when this and that is 
not available, and the state is unable to provide a dignified 
existence for television? By the way, Chernomyrdin, too, when he 
spoke on television, suggested that state companies should start 
thinking what should be converted to joint-stock holding, and 
what should be privatized. There are rumors that Ostankino will 
soon be converted to joint-stock holding with the participation 
of large industrial and banking capital. 
  [Lazutkin] It is impossible to build the country without a 
federal television and radio. This is the last thing that links 
together the cultural and information space of Russia. 
Therefore, it is necessary to preserve federal 
broadcasting--naturally, in an economical, sensible, aware mode. 
  As to conversion to joint-stock holding--even if it applied 
to Ostankino--I have no social allergy to it. Nevertheless, 
today the only part that can be converted to joint-stock holding 
is the top of the television iceberg--everything that is related 
to production of programs. In this area, one can even earn a 
profit. But as soon as you calculate the cost of one hour of 
broadcasting, including communications services, you will 
realize that nobody in the nonstate sphere of the economy has 
this kind of money. Ostankino broadcasts 19 hours a day; its 
budget for this year is 1.267 trillion rubles. Of this, 88 
percent goes to pay for communications services. This amount can 
be compared only with the national budget. I personally doubt 
very much that stockholders will undertake the financing of the 
real economic structure of television. It is unprofitable to 
convert a money-losing enterprise to joint-stock holding. Or are 
there illusions that it can be made profitable? 
  We can and need to put some other, healthy economic 
foundation under television. I do not consider it a humiliation 
to search for a possible model together with specialists who 
have already come into their own in this country. Banks, large 
concerns, financial-industrial groups. To make a joint effort to 
give the country real, full-fledged, healthy television is our 
common civic task. Real joint actions are possible--but, of 
course, with the participation of the government. Because, I 
repeat, I do not see this kind of untied money in the society 
that can be thrown into the television furnace. 
  [Petrovskaya] But Gusinskiy and the Most Group did find and 
did throw the money into the "television furnace." And, I think, 
they hit the jackpot. 
  [Lazutkin] First, do not forget that this channel from the 
beginning was set up as commercial, free of any formal 
obligations. A charter of any commercial organization--both in 
our country and in the West--says: This is an enterprise set up 
for the purpose of making a profit. Programming is a vehicle for 
advertising, a machine for extracting advertising money from the 
airwaves. Therefore, I do not at all preclude the possibility 
that economic analysis--which undoubtedly preceded the channel's 
creation--showed that it could be made into a profitable 
enterprise. Second, Channel 4 is incommensurately cheaper; you 
cannot compare it with Ostankino, because it has a much smaller 
coverage area. But the most important part still is that the 
channel is separated from the state. 
  Both Ostankino and VGTRK [All-Russia State Television and 
Radio Company] should probably remain state television--it has 
developed historically this way. Generally, however, I do not 
like the word "state." I prefer the model of "public television." 
  [Petrovskaya] "Public" is social-legal television, which 
assumes, on the one hand, the existence of a law on television, 
and on the other--society's ability to influence television 
through taxes and subscriber fees. We do not have either. 
  [Lazutkin] But we should arrive at this point. Why not? Our 
current status is transitional. We have to survive, to keep the 
"furnace" warm. Do note that we are not touching upon the image 
of television--whether we make good or bad television. 
Naturally, all our ambitions, complaints, appeals to the 
government, and to the president on behalf of the audience are 
justified only if we make decent television. The revival should 
take place not only in the economic and technological sphere, 
but also the creative one as well. But it is not smart and 
unnecessary to develop both the VGTRK and Ostankino in the same 
mode as NTV [Independent Television]. 
  [Petrovskaya] We lost the right to speak of Ostankino as 
public or state television quite a while ago, because it is to a 
much greater extent than NTV a machine for extracting 
advertising money from the airwaves. 
  [Lazutkin] If we judge by formal attributes, simply by the 
number of commercials on this channel, we have long been, of 
course, in the category of commercial stations. We do not 
collect the kind of money, however, that makes commercial 
companies profitable. For a variety of reasons. Some money 
settles in middlemen's pockets. Westerners coming to visit us 
say that there are now quite a few traveling salesmen who sell 
our advertising time in the West. We lose tremendous amounts of 
money on it. And the advertising rates we charge are, of course, 
far below those of a commercial station. At Western stations, 
advertising costs tens of millions, and ours so far goes for 
thousands of dollars. Unquestionably, we need to change the very 
approach to advertising activities, create large and strong 
advertising agencies around Ostankino. We are working on such 
plans at Ostankino now. 
  What else describes the transitional character of today's 
Ostankino? All organization of production is obsolete. Huge 
staff. If one beautiful day everybody reports to work, Ostankino 
may even collapse. We cannot live this way, as the classic said. 
We need to switch to producer-based organization, as in the West. 
  [Petrovskaya] If I understand it correctly, whether state 
television is to be or not to be, and what kind it will be, will 
be decided first and foremost by your federal service? 
  [Lazutkin] The point is that the FSR has not been set up 
yet, 
only announced as a legal entity. Creating it will take time. We 
have already written a sixth draft of the service's statute and 
will still add to it, modify it, because the situation changes 
and we cannot foresee everything. Of course, we will propose 
some radical solutions, but the main point of our philosophy is 
that the state cannot lose television. There is an immense 
national broadcasting network; it has to be developed, and 
opportunities created for new broadcasters to get on the air. 
Another side of the service's activities is support of 
entrepreneurship in the area of television, and control over 
rational use of budget money--less ostentatious. But the 
service's main task is to protect the interests of the audience. 
The statute we are developing now will not have a single hint at 
some powers related to the practice of interference in the 
companies' programming activities. But the service will have the 
right to monitor the integrity of broadcasting, that the 
broadcaster's intents and obligations correspond to his 
practice. The state has an obligation to protect the moral 
health of the nation through its institutions. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  I left Valentin Lazutkin's office without being any closer 
to 
an answer to the main question: How to save and preserve state 
television, which is on the brink of ruin? I agree that it is 
necessary to preserve state television--not because of its 
special mission, but simply because the more different kinds of 
television we have, the better; but I still never got an answer 
to the questions: 
  --Why it is so necessary to "disengage" commercial 
television 
from the state? 
  --Why is it not possible to predicate issuance of 
broadcasting licenses on certain requirements to the programs 
(the same "moral integrity," concern for expanding the 
audience's outlook, carrying out informational, consolidating, 
social-educational functions)? 
  --Finally, why not study recommendations developed in this 
respect in European countries, where commercial television is 
certainly not just "an instrument for earning a profit"--the 
evidence of which, among other things, is ITN News broadcast on 
Channel "2x2"?

"The Sober `Pravda' (`Truth') of Capitalism"] 
  [Text] DETAILS: The half-life of PRAVDA has been 
established by an experimental method. It turns out to be 89 
years. 
  At the end of last week, toward evening, journalists of 
PRAVDA urgently called together their colleagues for a desperate 
press conference, whose subject was the general meeting of the 
collective that had just taken place, where, in the absence of a 
quorum, the newspaper's editor in chief, Viktor Linnik, had been 
deposed. A schism in the collective was announced. 
  As has been the case in all such instances, this division 
has 
a hidden economic aspect. In the words of the Pravdites, the 
knot was tied up by the former editor in chief, Gennadiy 
Seleznev, who, for next to no money and without consultation 
with the collective, sold the controlling share of stock (55 
percent) to the Greek entrepreneur Gianis Giannikos. The 
authorized capital of the joint-stock company is laughable--1 
million rubles [R]. And thus, on the cheap, for R550,000, the 
Greek obtained the greater half of PRAVDA and the right to the 
deciding vote in all questions. The rest belongs to the 
editorial staff, but its vote does not carry any force. Having 
given away the "right of primogeniture" to Giannikos, the 
Pravdites expected assistance in publishing the newspaper. High 
salaries, vacations on Greek islands, and so forth, were 
promised. However, nothing fell from the "Greek apple tree" onto 
the heads of the journalists but a rotten apple core. From the 
entire editorial staff, only one person traveled to the Greek 
islands, today's Duma boyar Gennadiy Seleznev. 
  At the press conference, the Pravdites said that, being 
communists, they had crossed out the Communist Party at the 
December elections because third on its list was their former 
boss Gennadiy Seleznev. Although it was still the Greeks who 
vexed them more. They (the management of the joint-stock company 
Pravda International includes two very close relatives of the 
boss) did not pay for medical care or child care, and withheld 
payment on the pathetically small compensations for children; 
since October they have not paid publication fees, and, worst of 
all, have halted financing of publication and distribution of 
the newspaper. For three weeks before the beginning of elections 
to the Duma, PRAVDA stopped coming out. The financing of 
correspondents' offices and payment for the printing of the 
newspaper in the localities has been halted. Because of the 
economy, a multitude of telephone, teletype, and fax lines has 
been shut down. At the same time, the Greek side has engaged in 
assault and battery, has interfered in the publication of the 
newspaper (a journalist who wrote something negative about a 
personal acquaintance of the owner was promptly fired), and 
posted an order reprimanding the editor in chief, who is neither 
subordinate nor accountable to the Greeks in any case, since he 
is an elected official. 
  PRAVDA had its own small cafeteria, which cost slightly 
less; 
the Greeks eliminated it. Putting the staff on a hunger ration, 
the bosses returned to its pristine form the "chief editor's 
dining room," which had been closed during democratic times, and 
now they themselves take their meals there. 
  After the transformation of the editorial office into a 
joint-stock company, the remaining 45 percent of the shares that 
were left to the collective were not distributed among the 
workers, so each one individually could hardly be considered a 
proprietor. The only thing that still belongs to the journalist 
collective are the founder's rights, including the patented 
trademark. The Greeks, naturally, also encroached upon the final 
thing remaining to the Pravdites, who had been cheaply sold by 
Gennadiy Seleznev. Not everyone agreed to give up this final 
thing. 
  The owners compiled a blacklist of 13 journalists upon whose 
firing they insist. Among them, for instance, are last year's 
Russian professional prize laureates Stanislav Pastukhov (he 
runs the Moscow publication of PRAVDA) and Yuriy Glukhov. Not a 
single point of the contract have they violated, but the 
businessmen do not like them. It is simpler to consider the 
objectionable ones as departments: the information department, 
the international department, the photography department.... The 
bosses also want to curtail the activity of the journalistic 
organization of the editorial office. As a separate issue, they 
want to drive out Viktor Linnik. In exchange, they promise to 
resume financing, raise salaries, pay the fees they owe, and, 
possibly, to send the subjugated to vacation on the shores of 
the Aegean Sea. 
  In violation of the joint-stock company's charter, the fate 
of the collective was entrusted not to an assembly of 
journalists, but to a general assembly of workers. The workers, 
whose ranks include, besides journalists, drivers, proofreaders, 
translators, and secretaries from the Greeks' office, in an open 
vote threw out the editor in chief, whom they themselves had 
elected to that post three months before. Aleksandr Ilin was 
elected acting editor-in-chief; he had already been named to 
that post by Minister Shumeyko after the October events. 
Eighty-seven (of a staff of 216 persons) spoke against 
confidence in Linnik and against confirmation of his commission 
(when he was elected as chief editor, he received 40 votes). 
Ninety were for entrusting these duties to Aleksandr Ilin. These 
same workers, by a majority of votes, resolved to continue the 
cooperation with the Greek company. In the words of the new 
acting editor, the Greeks need the founder's rights for greater 
surety: They bear the expenses and must be insured against a 
situation where their ouster suddenly seemed desirable. 
  No professional claims were made either of Viktor Linnik or 
of the persons figuring on the blacklist, but at the meeting, 
the Greeks snitched to the collective that they had paid the 
current editor in chief extra in foreign currency (about 
Gennadiy Seleznev they said nothing). Viktor Linnik, however, 
expecting such a turn of events, opened a safe and rendered an 
accounting to the last drachma: He had released the money for 
the publication of PRAVDA. At this newspaper, many people work 
literally for kopeks. PRAVDA journalists today have a salary of 
R25,000: That is how much satirist Valentin Prokhorov makes. And 
he would be happy to be getting even that much, but since 
January the Greeks have not paid salaries at all. One of 
PRAVDA's most highly paid journalists, Aleksandr Ilin, named the 
acting chief editor, receives R130,000. 
  In the words of Stanislav Pastukhov, one of the senior 
employees at PRAVDA, it was not the best portion of the 
collective who supported the Greeks; it was basically people who 
had worked for a year or a year and a half, "those because of 
whom communists are referred to as Red-browns." 
  At the press conference, Viktor Linnik announced that he was 
not planning to leave the post of editor-in-chief and that he 
did not acknowledge the decision of the illegal assembly. 
However, he is not now in a position to dismiss the "mutineers," 
because of the dual power that formed long ago at the newspaper, 
where the Greeks interfere in the operational management. It is 
also hard for him to imagine how he is going to manage to break 
off relations with the Greeks and with what money he will 
support the flickering life of PRAVDA. After all, even the R200 
million received from subscribers is controlled by the Giannikos 
family. In January, 15 issues were published instead of 22. 
Money for publication, reported Viktor Linnik, was given by the 
entrepreneur Konstantin Zatulin and the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation. 
  On the one hand, of course, the market is the market. 
However, the attempts of Pravdites to clarify the financial 
condition of the joint-stock company, of which a part of the 
authorized capital still belongs to them, have come to 
nothing--the Greeks have not shown them a single paper.

<F P=106> Interview with A. Matrosov, Minister of the Government of </F>
Moscow and head of the Department for Engineering Support, by 
Albert Kozlov and Vladimir Naumov: "With An Accuracy Of Up To 
One Square Meter; Commencing 1 March, Muscovites Await An 
Increase In Payments For Housing And Muncipal Services"] 
  [Text] The Minister of Government for Moscow and head of 
the department for Engineering Support, A. Matrosov, comments 
upon an increase in rental payments in the capital. 
  [Matrosov] This is not simply a compulsory measure -- it is 
long overdue. The municipal-housing economy has operated at a 
loss since 1976. In 1993, the population paid only 0.24 percent 
of the expenditures for the maintenance and repair of housing 
and at the present time this proportion may decline to three 
percent. More budgetary appropriations are needed: in 1994, 
according to very modest estimates, 715 billion rubles will be 
required for the maintenance of available housing and for 
thermal energy -- more than one trillion rubles. Roughly 2.3 
trillion rubles will be needed for capital repair work. The city 
cannot endure such expenditures. Only an increase in payments by 
the population can save the housing fund from inevitable 
collapse. This is borne out in Decree No. 41 of the government 
of Moscow, dated 11 January 1994. In accordance with this 
decree, a new system of payments for housing and municipal 
services will be introduced commencing 1 March. 
  [Kozlov/Naumov] What will be the new rates for apartment 
rentals? 
  [Matrosov] The maximum rate called for commencing 1 March -- 
24 rubles for one square meter of overall apartment space, with 
all municipal conveniences in an apartment house having an 
elevator and rubbish chute and not located in the outskirts of 
Moscow. 
  [Kozlov/Naumov] And indeed have the prices for all municipal 
services increased sharply at the same time? 
  [Matrosov] Yes, the charge for heating each square meter of 
apartment space will increase from three to 25 rubles. Hot water 
supply -- from 53 to 455 rubles per person. And gas, for which 
we are today collecting from 17 to 27 rubles, will be increased 
to 25-49 rubles. At the present time, each individual is paying 
an average of 44 rubles for water and sewerage service and in 
the future -- from 115 to 300 rubles. 
  Thus, a family of three individuals occupying an apartment 
of 
54 square meters of space and enjoying all conveniences will pay 
5,055 rubles per month. 
  [Kozlov/Naumov] This is a very painful price increase, 
especially for low income families. 
  [Matrosov] I agree that this is a very serious step. Thus 
the 
decree calls for measures which will lessen the severity of this 
price shock for poor people. First of all, the plans call for a 
program of subsidies, with 11 billion rubles to be allocated for 
this purpose. The subsidies will be issued in a manner such that 
a family's rental expenditures for 1994 will not exceed 10 
percent of its overall family income. According to our 
estimates, commencing in March one out of every hundred families 
will receive a housing allowance. 
  [Kozlov/Naumov] And how will these needy families be found? 
  [Matrosov] It is expected that territorial services will be 
established for the handling of housing subsidies. Residents 
will provide them with a statement, an extract from their 
housing register and information on the income of family 
members. The subsidy amount, in accordance with which the 
apartment rent will be reduced, will be computed for them based 
upon these documents. 
  [Kozlov/Naumov] But will the March increase in apartment 
rent 
be the last one? 
  [Matrosov] The plans call for a second one in June. In 
accordance with the decree, the maximum payment for a square 
meter of housing space during the second half of the year will 
be 117 rubles. And subsequently there will be new price 
increases. These will be aimed at softening the impact of the 
raised prices. At least in the beginning, the payment for rent 
will not be 10 percent of a family's budget but rather less. 
Obviously, there will also be other corrections. But on the 
whole, I am confident that the document will be adopted. As the 
saying goes, there is no retreating. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  And here is the opinion of the prefect of the capital's 
central district, Aleksandr Muzykantskiy. 
  "Aleksandr Ilich, apartments in Moscow are planned and 
arranged according to several categories depending upon the 
degree of conveniences. Thus the costs for operational expenses 
must vary. Is this not so?" 
  [Matrosov] This goes without saying. They are higher in 
prestigious apartment buildings: here there is more space, 
hallways and, it follows, greater heating expenses. 
  [Kozlov/Naumov] Is there no fear that growth in apartment 
rent will bring about an increase in the number of those who 
fall behind in their payments? 
  [Matrosov] Today the obligations for apartment rent amount 
to 
a miserly figure and it is much more expensive to have a system 
for monitoring those who fall behind in their payments. 
Moreover, there are justifiable methods for guarding against 
such individuals. There is no problem here. 
  In accordance with existing practice, we are aware that 
regardless of the level at which decrees are adopted, they 
almost always suffer from one shortcoming: the social protection 
for people that is specified in them is constantly being 
violated. By way of justifying this fact, governmental 
representatives complain that a "good" decree is unable to 
create an effective mechanism for implementation. Will this not 
also be the case for the above-mentioned document of the Moscow 
government?

<F P=106> Article by Yana Mirontseva: "Modernization of the </F>
Magnitogorsk Combine; Magnitka Should Be Transformed Into a 
Modern Plant"] 
  [Text] The biggest Russian metallurgical 
enterprise--the Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine--is 
conducting a comprehensive program of modernization and 
reconstruction. A governmental delegation of managers of 
ministries that visited Magnitogorsk has returned to Moscow. The 
objective of their trip was to prepare a presidential draft 
edict concerning the completion of the modernization of the 
Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine. The sum of necessary 
investments for Magnitka's transformation into a modern 
world-standard plant is estimated to be 1.03 trillion 
rubles.[R] 
  The Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine is one of the largest 
plants in Russia. Its maximum annual volume of steel smelting 
has totaled 16 million tonnes--this record was achieved in 1989. 
A large-scale program to modernize the combine was started in 
1985. This program was supposed to be financed by the state, and 
it was only partially implemented because of a shortage of 
budgetary resources. Only the first object of modernization--the 
oxygen-converter shop--was built--it was put into operation in 
1991. 
  The next object in the comprehensive program of 
modernization 
of Magnitka was the hot-rolling "mill 2000," whose start-up is 
planned for the first to second quarter of this year. The mill 
has its own interesting history: At first, it was sold to 
Poland, and, subsequently, the Poles changed their mind, and 
"mill 2000" returned to Russia. All of these operations were 
conducted under the aegis of interstate agreements. Magnitka had 
to assemble it, which is also a rather expensive measure. 
  The third measure of the modernization program is the 
start-up of the largest cold-rolling mill of "mill 2000"--one of 
the main measures of the federal program for the development of 
metallurgy. Up until now, similar mills existed only in three 
Russian metallurgical plants--in Cherepovets, Volgograd, and 
Lipetsk. Of course, they represent much older modifications. The 
Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine has concluded a contract with 
the German firm Schleman-Siman for a total sum of $590 million. 
The general contractor for this project will be the Magnitostroy 
trust. The Rosmontazhspetsstroy organization will participate in 
the assembly work, and the Uralmash organization--one of the 
contenders for implementing the entire project--will take part 
in the production of equipment. 
  The introduction of all three objects will transform 
Magnitka 
into a modern metallurgical plant that conforms to Western 
standards. It is expected that this will take four years and 
that the volume of necessary financing will be R1.03 trillion. 
Naturally, without state support that is manifested in both 
favorable investment credits and in exemption from customs 
duties for this period, the combine will not be able to 
implement its plans. Although, as was declared by Mr. Sarychev, 
the technical director of the combine, in order to attract 
resources for the modernization with the help of issues, it is 
possible that a scheme will be employed for a separate 
conversion of the new plant to a joint-stock company, 
conditionally called Steel-2.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Fridman: "Russian Mines Prepared To </F>
Reduce Gold Production"; first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] If the situation develops unfavorably, gold 
output may, according to the estimates of miners themselves, 
drop to 30-40 tonnes compared to more than 70 tonnes in 1993. 
  The situation will be unfavorable if cooperatives of gold 
miners do not receive traditional interest-free advances in 
preparation for a new season. 
  The fact is that a large share of gold in Russia -- up to 
60-65 percent of the total -- is obtained in the third quarter, 
and the first half of the year is spent on preparation for the 
season, i.e., the provision of equipment, fuel and food, the 
stripping of deposits and the mining of ore and underground 
sands, which requires money that was formerly paid to gold 
miners in the form of interest-free advances. Now the state 
proposes to advance these funds, which amount to half of the 
cost of gold mined in Russia -- more than 600 billion rubles -- 
at an annual interest of 120 percent. 
  This variant, however, will, in the opinion of Viktor 
Tarakanovsky, head of the Council of the Union of Gold Miners' 
Cooperatives, make gold mining profitless even if the price of 
gold increases. Miners themselves predict that the price of one 
gram of gold may rise from the present 17,400 rubles to 
41,000-42,000 rubles by the end of the year. 
  The price of gold in Russia is fixed every month on the 
basis 
of world prices recalculated into rubles at the Central Bank's 
current exchange rate. 
  Gold miners take advances for eight months, till the end of 
the third quarter, and are thus obliged to repay by this time 
the 300 billion rubles of advance and almost as much interest. 
Taken together this will amount to about 21 percent of the cost 
of the gold mined by them. Taking into account 30 percent of 
expenses and the total taxes levied at 55 percent, the 
expenditure on gold mining will exceed its cost. 
  In order to resolve the problem gold miners propose to 
return 
to interest-free advances pointing out that it is in fact not a 
credit but a prepayment for the precious metal. The Union of 
Gold Miners' Cooperatives guarantees that advances will be 
issued only to enterprises which really mine gold. These 
guarantees are all the more necessary since, according to some 
estimates, during the last two years advances for mining of 
about six tonnes of gold were given to organizations which did 
not intend to mine it. During the year they "turned over" the 
money as they saw fit, then apologized for the absence of gold 
and returned the advance, pocketing, naturally, all the profit 
from it. 
  Now the state, unwilling to issue free credits right and 
left, rejects altogether the system of interest-free advances. 
In the second half of January Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin 
instructed the Ministry of Finance to work out a new mechanism 
of financing gold production. The time limit of the instruction 
ended on February 1, and it was officially proposed to miners to 
borrow advances at 120 percent annual interest. At the same time 
it was hinted to slow-witted miners that anyone in their 
position would elementarily take advantage on the difference of 
this rate and that of commercial banks which is now at least 
100-120 percent higher. 
  But Viktor Tarakanovsky believes that miners would not be 
able, even if they wanted to, to "turn over" the money received 
since the preparation for the season should begin practically 
immediately. It should be pointed out that, should miners have 
agreed to such terms at the end of the last year when the time 
of the issue of advances came, they might possibly have greater 
freedom of manoeuvre now. It should be taken into account, 
however, that during the preparation for the season the world 
price of gold offers no advantages since miners are forced to 
buy many materials at prices much higher than world ones; in 
particular, the price of fuel for them in some regions reaches 
800,000 rubles a tonne, which is almost four times above the 
world level. 
  Gold miners' cooperatives pinned some hopes on the 
president's December decree on the liberalization of the gold 
market, which provided for the setting up of a "gold exchange" 
and the granting to some commercial banks of the right to 
conduct operations with gold. In this case gold-mining 
enterprises could agree with a concrete bank on mutually 
advantageous terms of cooperation. But the numerous delays in 
the implementation of the decree, of which not only miners 
complain, suggest the conclusion that the actual issue of 
licences to banks and operations at the gold exchange cannot 
start for several more months. 
  Nor will miners be able to benefit by the growth in the 
domestic price of gold when it will be determined at the 
exchange. Although the domestic price may prove considerably 
higher, according to some estimates -- by 1.2-1.3 times -- than 
the world price (since the demand for gold as a means of 
preserving capital will probably be very high) any organization 
interested in obtaining gold can, if it makes proper efforts, 
buy it abroad. 
  Several major state gold-mining associations, first of all 
the Yakut and Magadan ones (which account for about half of all 
mined gold), already demand that the price of gold should be 
raised to 60,000 rubles a gram. In these conditions the exchange 
price of gold will be altogether unpredictable, especially at 
the beginning. 
  The Union of Gold Miners' Cooperatives does not consider 
such 
conditions acceptable but, since it is not a rigid structure, 
cooperatives themselves and their associations in regions may in 
some cases agree to such conditions (they will most probably be 
joined by state enterprises), especially since some cooperative 
leaders stated already at the end of last year their intention 
to maintain the volume of output even if the state takes the 
most rigid position in relation to them. 
  But the problem of credits remains all the same, since they 
can be taken, if gold miners refuse to do so, by other 
commercial structures which are least of all concerned about the 
mining of gold. Perhaps the only thing left to count on is a 
repetition of late 1992 and the beginning of 1993 when 
practically everyone also spoke about unbearable conditions and 
the inevitable reduction of gold mining in 1993 as a result gold 
production remained at the 1992 level, just exceeding 140 tonnes.

<F P=106> [Article by Artem Kudinov: "Novosibirsk Oblast Intends To </F>
Increase Gold Extraction"] 
  [Text] The Novosibirsk Geological Committee yesterday 
announced plans for the conduct of a number of competitions for 
the exploitation of alluvial (in river sediment) gold deposits 
located in the oblast. The oblast administration decided to take 
this step in connection with a sharp decrease in the extraction 
of gold. 
  As Oleg Ivanov, chairman of the territorial Committee on 
Geology and Utilization of the Mineral Resources of Novosibirsk 
and Omsk Oblasts (Novosibgeolkom), stated in an exclusive 
interview for KOMMERSANT-DAILY, several areas of gold deposits 
exist in the territory of Maslyaninskiy Rayon, Novosibirsk 
Oblast. The gold is contained in river sediment (alluvial 
deposits). According to Novosibgeolkom data, extraction volumes 
of the high-purity gold (950-990 pure) in 1993 amounted to 84 
kilograms--less than the 1990 volume by a factor of 2.2. In 
Ivanov's opinion, the drop in gold extraction can be explained 
through insufficient funds of gold prospecting cooperatives and 
the poor organization of their work. 
  Mr. Ivanov did not rule out the possibility of an auction 
being conducted for the right of exploitation of the alluvial 
gold deposit areas, as envisaged by the Law on Mineral 
Resources. In such event, Novosibirsk Oblast would be one of the 
first in Russia to test the auction scenario although, as the 
Novosibgeolkom chairman emphasized, this alternative "has a 
number of significant deficiencies." In his opinion, conduct of 
an auction does not preclude the possibility that licenses will 
be acquired at random by private individuals uninterested in 
extracting gold and only capable of acting as intermediaries. In 
Mr. Ivanov's words, particular features of the Novosibirsk gold 
deposits make them suitable for development by small enterprises 
and gold prospecting cooperatives, insofar as the extraction of 
gold at them does not require significant financial investments. 
  The main participants in the competitions and auctions will 
most likely be five or six prospecting cooperatives and 
enterprises of Novosibirsk Oblast. Mr. Ivanov stated that 
enterprises of Novosibirsk Oblast exclusively will be permitted 
to participate in the competitions, and that the list of gold 
deposit areas designated for tender (auction) would be published 
in the mass media following coordination with the Novosibirsk 
Oblast Administration.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Fridman: "`Tokur-Zoloto' Expects to </F>
Increase Gold Production"] 
  [Text] In late January, the Russian "Tokur-Zoloto" company, 
one of the new private gold-mining concerns, bought for 150 
million rubles the rights to a total of four deposits -- 3 gold 
and one ore -- in the Amur region. 
  Experts estimate their total reserves at several dozen 
tonnes. Thus, the company already owns 7 deposits in the region, 
regarded as one of the most promising in gold. The prospected 
reserves of 4 deposits, obtained earlier, amount to 300 tonnes, 
and the Tokur ore deposit amounts to over 250 tonnes. 
  In order to develop these deposits the company, set up in 
1992 as a closed joint-stock company, started to issue its 
stocks, worth 7.7 billion rubles, in September 1993. Today the 
stocks of "Tokur-Zoloto" are sold at a price approximately five 
times higher than their nominal value of 1,000 rubles. However, 
even under such conditions there will hardly be enough capital 
generated from the conversion into a joint-stock company, for 
fulll-scale development of a 250-260 tonne deposit -- half as 
much is required for this. 
  In this case any company has two opportunities: either to 
find a major investor, most likely foreign, who will agree to 
participate in the project. Or engage in other operations which 
would enable it to obtain considerable financial resources in a 
short period of time. 
  "Tokur-Zoloto" is pursuing both alternatives. On the one 
hand, talks are being conducted with Western mining companies on 
their participation in mining Tokur gold; on the other, 
"Tokur-Zoloto" can mine gold from its rather big tracer 
deposits. The tracer deposits call for less expenses (compared 
with ore deposits) and pay for themselves more quickly, the more 
so as the company disposes of unnecessary equipment in the Amur 
region. Last year "Tokur-Zoloto" mined about 500 kg of metal, 
which is not much for such a company, but in 1994 it expects to 
increase gold production, bringing it up to several tonnes. 
  It is also quite possible to further increase the authorized 
capital and, consequently, new emission of stocks. 
  In trying to make its securities more attractive, 
"Tokur-Zoloto" is preparing to hold a lottery in April-May 1994 
among its share-holders, at which gold nuggets will be drawn. 
This will be the second lottery; the results of the first were 
revealed in January. Three winners -- a student of the Moscow 
Institute of Physical Engineering, the Moscow branch of 
"Metkombank," and the head of a construction firm from Samara -- 
won nuggets weighing 201, 147 and 99 grams respectively The 
presentation took place in late January at the Russian Army 
Theatre during the premiere of Peter Stein's "Orestea," which 
"Tokur-Zoloto" assisted in preparing. 
  It must be pointed out that this was the first ever transfer 
of gold nuggets to citizens in Russia. 
  The mounting confidence in the company may also be 
facilitated by the policy of "Tokur-Zoloto" on the domestic gold 
market, now taking shape. 
  Since the time it was founded, the company has been linked 
with a number of Russian banks, having substantial shares of the 
authorized capital in two of them and, in addition, cooperating 
with several leading banks which may count on being granted the 
right of conducting operations in gold. 
  Such a right will also spread to security operations with 
metal (at present the government is preparing a resolution on 
this issue) which will enable "Tokur-Zoloto" to draw additional 
means on the security of gold at its disposal.

(Soyuzmorniiproyekt): "The Development of USSR Seaports in 
1981-1990"] 
  [Text] It is no secret that a serious situation has formed 
in Russian ports today -- they are choking, failing to cope with 
the influx of cargo, particularly foreign trade cargo, which is 
processed only at 11 harbors. At the same time, the related 
enterprises of the former USSR republics are experiencing a 
shortage of freight flow, since the Russian commodity producers, 
because of the customs barriers and the high fees for transit 
through the territory of the Baltic countries and Ukraine, do 
not want to have anything to do with them, and are trying to 
ship or import the necessary products exclusively through 
Russian ports. In order to evaluate our overall losses, it will 
be of interest to become familiar with the development of the 
seaports of the former Soviet Union in the decade preceding the 
country's breakup. 
  The national economy's growing need for marine cargo 
transport in 1981-1990 foreordained an increase in the 
throughput capacities of the seaports, both through building new 
ports and rebuilding and re-equipping the existing ones. In this 
case, some berths were adapted for intensive processing of large 
ships of new types. 
  Transshipment of dry cargo was mainly provided by 35 
seaports, particularly the ports of Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, 
Leningrad, Riga, Klaypeda, Novotallinn, Odessa, Ilichevsk, 
Yuzhnyy, Mariupol, Nikolayev, Novorossiysk, Izmail, Reni, 
Vladivostok, Nakhodka, Vostochnyy, Vanino, Kholm, Baku and 
Krasnovodsk. The length of the mooring front for dry cargo 
transshipping was increased by 15.5 percent, and the throughput 
capacity -- by 27.7 percent. A large amount of the bulk cargo 
was processed at eight ports, mainly at Ventspils, Novorossiysk, 
Odessa, Tuapse, Aktau and Nakhodka. The throughput capacities of 
their oil regions fully provided the existing cargo turnover 
with oil products, although the berth structures of the Port of 
Odessa's oil harbor needed rebuilding to take tankers with a 
deadweight of 50,000-60,000 tonnes, and the approach channel of 
the Port of Ventspils had to be deepened for the passage of 
tankers and combined ships with a deadweight of about 100,000 
tonnes. 
  The throughput capacity of the bulk cargo berths was 
increased by 45 percent, with only a 14 percent increase in the 
number of berths. 
  In addition, they succeeded in partially eliminating the 
disproportion between the sizes of the ships and the depths in 
the ports. For example, the number of berths with a depth of 
9.75-11.5 m attained 25 percent of the total number, but those 
with depths of over 11.5 m -- only a little over 6 percent, 
which was clearly inadequate. A large number of the berths (44 
percent) have depths up to 8.25 m, and several of them need 
rebuilding. 
  Transshipping complexes were developed both through creating 
new ones and rebuilding and re-equipping the existing 
material-technical base of the ports. As a result, the 
throughput capacity of commercial seaports rose by 15-16 million 
tonnes. The main direction in improving their activity was 
intensification of the loading-unloading operations, through 
improving the technology and organization of complete service of 
the fleet in the ports. 
  Despite the widescale distribution of container transport of 
crated and piece goods, a tremendous products list of general 
cargo remains which is not subject to containerization. To 
increase the volume of its transshipment, methods of packaging, 
the use of roll-trailers and complexes with a 
computer-controlled system of belt conveyors and many others 
have been developed. 
  Along with modernizing the transshipping units at seaports, 
it is very important, for increased efficiency of fleet 
operation, to improve its service -- supplying bunker fuel, 
water, foodstuffs, etc. -- for maximum reduction of ship idle 
times, above and beyond the cargo operations. 
  Specializing the maritime transport fleet according to the 
nature of cargo being transported and type of transport 
packaging, combined with increasing the intensiveness of 
loading-unloading operations, has made possible a considerable 
increase in the cargo capacity of the ships and, as a result, a 
rise in their economic efficiency. 
  The increased size of ships designed primarily to transport 
mass cargoes has required further intensification of 
loading-unloading work, based on setting up specialized 
complexes, equipped with a system of conveyor lines, 
railcar-tippers or other means of high-speed processing of 
railcars, powerful gantry cranes, reclaimers, container 
unloaders and other means of mechanizing and automating cargo 
operations. 
  The development at seaports of high-productivity specialized 
units to transship mass cargoes and of deep-water berths, and 
the formation of the corresponding operational harbors and 
approach channels, cannot be effective unless these cargo flows 
are concentrated in a small number of ports. It is for this 
purpose that ports such as Yuzhnyy and Novotallinn, which now 
find themselves outside Russia's borders, were built. 
  By the beginning of 1991, the fixed production capital of 
the 
seaports was estimated at 5,932 million rubles [R]. Here, the 
largest relative share belonged to the ports of the Black 
Sea-Azov and Danube basins -- 39.4 percent. The share of the Far 
Eastern basin was 28.8 percent, of the Baltic -- 21.9 percent, 
the Northern -- 7.3 percent and the Caspian basin -- 2.6 
percent. The distribution of the ports' fixed capital among the 
republics looked like this: for the Russian ports of the Black 
Sea-Azov basin -- R388 million (16.6 percent), the Ukrainian 
ports -- R1,819 million (78 percent), the Georgian ports -- R127 
million (5.4 percent); the Russian ports on the Baltic basin -- 
R454 million (35 percent), and the remaining R675 million (65 
percent) -- the ports of Lithuania (11 percent), Latvia (22.5 
percent) and Estonia (31.5 percent). 
<H5>  Specialized Complexes To Transship Bulk Cargo </H5>
  The Port of Murmansk exports apatite concentrate 
and iron ore. The specialized complex to transship apatite 
concentrate can take ships with a deadweight up to 40,000 tonnes 
and its loading productivity is 2,400 t/hr. 
  The industrial complex for the transshipment of apatite 
concentrate includes a railroad unloading gallery, an apatite 
concentrate warehouse, a shore-based loading gallery, loading 
machines, a system of conveyor belts and transfer stations and a 
central control post. 
  The apatite concentrate is transported from the Apatity 
Station to the Port of Murmansk in special cars with an elevated 
body. A consist of 87 cars, with a total freight capacity of 
about 5,000 tonnes, is fed to the railroad tracks of the complex 
and then nine cars at a time go to a double-track gallery, where 
unloading is done as they move along it. Two hoppers with a 
capacity of 540 tonnes each are placed under the railroad tracks 
in the gallery. From here the freight goes by belt-conveyor 
feeder to the main belt conveyors and then, depending on the 
work variant, to the ship or to the warehouse. 
  The apatite concentrate warehouse, made in the form of a 
longitudinal reinforced concrete hopper with two lower 
longitudinal outlet slots and a roof on top, accommodates 25,000 
tonnes of concentrate. 
  The iron ore berth at the Murmansk seaport can take ships 
with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. The technical 
productivity of the gantry cranes is 2,800 t/hr. 
  The Kandalaksha seaport specializes in 
transshipping iron ore which arrives at the port by rail from 
the deposits of the Kolskiy Peninsula, for further transport by 
river ships to the Cherepovetsk Metallurgy Combine. The special 
loading unit includes a system of belt conveyors, a 
railcar-tipper and loading machines at the berths and warehouse. 
The river ship loading rate reaches 3,000 t/hr. 
  The Ventspils seaport transships potassium salt to 
seagoing ships by means of a specialized transshipping complex 
constructed at the rebuilt deep-water berth. This complex has 
two loading machines at the berth, with a total productivity of 
3,000 t/hr, a pyramid-type storage warehouse and a system of 
conveyor lines in enclosed galleries, and can take and process 
ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. Its throughput 
capacity is estimated at a level of 2.5-3.0 million tonnes a 
year. 
  The first section of the Port of Novotallinn. 
which includes complexes to transship grain and perishable wheat 
products, was put into operation on the Baltic basin in 1989. 
  The grain complex is made up of a deep-water pier with two 
berths, which can take ships with a deadweight of up to 100,000 
tonnes, is equipped with conveyor lines to feed the grain into a 
300,000-tonne capacity elevator located on the shore, and has 
one berth (quay) to take bulk freighters with a deadweight of up 
to 50,000 tonnes, at which grain can be both loaded and 
unloaded. The total throughput capacity of the grain complex is 
estimated on a level of 5-6 million tonnes a year. 
  The Odessa seaport has a specialized berth to take 
ships with raw sugar transported in bulk. The berth is equipped 
with gantry cranes and conveyor lines in galleries to feed the 
sugar to the onshore warehouse. The technical productivity for 
unloading sugar is 450 t/hr. 
  Modernization measures were carried out in 1985, making it 
possible to increase the raw sugar unloading productivity. 
  Grain-carrying ships are unloaded at the Port of Odessa at a 
specialized berth, equipped with conveyor lines, cranes and 
pneumatic grain loaders. The pier was extended by 90 m, with the 
necessary increase in depth at the berth, to take large 
grain-carrying ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. 
  The Nikolayev seaport has a special unit to load 
ore onto seagoing ships, traveling to the ports of the Ukrainian 
Danube Shipping Company -- Izmail and Reni, where the ore is 
transshipped to river barges for delivery to countries on the 
Danube. 
  The special transshipping complex includes a car-tipper to 
unload the iron ore arriving by rail, a system of conveyor lines 
to feed the ore to the warehouse or to the berth, and also 
loading machines with a technical productivity reaching 3,000 
t/hr. 
  The Port of Yuzhnyy. Construction of the port was 
begun on the Adzharlykskiy estuary in 1974. Two berths were 
built on its western shore for dry chemical cargo -- carbamide, 
shipped for export (in bulk or in sacks) by means of special 
units. These berths can take large ships with a deadweight of up 
to 50,000 tonnes. Loading in bulk is done at a rate of 500 t/hr, 
and in sacks -- 300 t/hr. A Korgoveyer type loading machine was 
placed at the berth to load carbamide in sacks. Berths were also 
built for transshipment of liquefied ammonia and superphosphoric 
acid, as well as for methanol and nitrilic acid. 
  A transshipping complex with a total berth front of 650 m 
was 
erected on the eastern shore of the estuary for transshipment of 
bulk cargoes, mainly ore and coal, and it can take three ships 
with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes at the same time. There 
is a possibility that two ships with a deadweight of 100,000 
tonnes each can be accepted after the harbor area has been 
deepened. 
  At the cordon and in the rear there are gantry cranes with a 
large hoisting capacity, the Atlant type -- 20/32 tonnes, and 
the Sokol type -- 16/32 tonnes, depending on the radius of the 
boom. Railcars with bulk freight arriving at the port are 
unloaded by means of car-tippers, and then it proceeds along the 
conveyor belt system at the rear or cordon-side warehouse areas 
for transfer to the ship by means of grab-bucket cranes. The 
throughput capacity of this complex is estimated at 5-6 million 
tonnes a year. 
  In addition, two transshipping complexes were built here to 
take phosphorites off ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 
tonnes, and then ship them by rail. Each of these complexes 
includes a berth, two transfer machines with a productivity of 
1,200 t/hr and a warehouse with conveyor systems. Their total 
throughput capacity is estimated at 4 million tonnes a year. 
  The Novorossiysk seaport transships the following 
bulk cargoes: grain and raw sugar for import and cement for 
export. The grain is processed at an elevator complex, which, 
since its rebuilding, can take ships with a deadweight of up to 
50,000 tonnes or 100,000 tonnes after they are unloaded in the 
roads to 60,000 tonnes. The gross rate of unloading ships with a 
deadweight of 30,000 tonnes is 16,200 t/ship-day. 
  The port has a special unit with a productivity of 450 t/hr 
to unload raw-sugar from ships. 
  One of the berths of the cement area loads bulk cement onto 
ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. 
  The Mariupol seaport specializes in transshipping 
coal arriving from the mines of the Donetsk basin to be shipped 
both for export (primarily to the countries along the Danube) 
and for coastal trading. The coal complex is equipped with a 
special unit, consisting of a railcar-tipper, a system of 
conveyor lines and two loading machines installed at one berth, 
which load coal with a technical productivity of about 2,200 
t/hr. At other berths of the coal complex, the coal is loaded by 
grab-bucket gantry cranes. The port takes ships with a draft of 
8.0-8.5 m. 
  The Poti seaport ships about 2 million tonnes of 
manganese ore a year, both for coastal trading and for export. 
Its berths can take ships with a deadweight up to 30,000 tonnes. 
  Bulk cargo in large quantities (mainly coal and ore) are 
transshipped at the ports of the Ukrainian Danube Shipping 
Company -- Reni and Izmail. These cargoes arrive from the ports 
of Mariupol and Nikolayev in small ships (including ships for 
combined sailing) and in winter partly by railroad, and are then 
transshipped on river barges to travel along the Danube to ports 
in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The coal and ore 
are loaded by gantry cranes. 
  The Port of Vostochnyy in the Far Eastern basin has 
special complexes to load coal onto seagoing ships with a 
deadweight of up to 100,000 tonnes and a complex to load 
industrial woodchips onto ships. 
  The first section of the coal complex, put into operation in 
1980, includes a deep-water pier with two berths, where, by 
means of a system of conveyor lines and two loading machines, 
installed at one pier, ships are loaded with a technical 
productivity of about 6,000 t/hr. After the second deep-water 
coal pier berth is put into operation, the throughput capacity 
of the complex will increase to 12 million tonnes a year. 
  Construction of a complex to transship potassium salt for 
export, with a throughput capacity of about 2 million tonnes a 
year, has been planned and begun. Large bulkers with a 
deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes will be loaded here. 
<H3>  Specialized Complexes To Transship Containers and Rolling 
Equipment </H3>
  The development of transport of containers and enlarged 
cargo 
pieces and of various wheeled and caterpillar equipment, as well 
as the increased size of specialized container ships and 
rolkers, has made it necessary to develop terminals equipped 
with various types of container transshippers, and storage areas 
with the corresponding dimensions and means of automated 
loading-unloading operation control. These terminals have been 
or are being developed at a number of major ports on all our 
country's marine basins. 
  For example, the Port of Arkhangelsk built a new 
area, Ekonomiya, for transshipment of general cargo with larger 
pieces and special containers of the Norilsk Mining-Metallurgy 
Combine, as well as standard 20-foot containers. 
  Large bulk container ships of the Mikhail Strekalovskiy 
type, 
and timber-carrier-pallet-carriers of the Nikolay Novikov type, 
the draft of which should not exceed 9.0 m, will be moored in 
this area. 
  Under reconstruction at the Port of Leningrad, is 
the port's third area, at which modern deep-water berths were 
built to receive and process large container carriers with a 
capacity of about 1,200 containers, and rolkers of the Kapitan 
Smirnov or Magnitogorsk type, with a capacity of about 60,000 
m[.sup]3[/] and a draft of up to 10 m. This terminal includes 
two berths, equipped with container loaders, and a storage area 
to accommodate containers and wheeled equipment. 
  Container loaders of the gantry type, installed at the 
berth, 
will process the ships and deliver the containers to the 
warehouse or to the berth, and truck-mounted container loaders 
will also carry out warehousing operations. The 
loading-unloading and warehouse operations at the terminal will 
be implemented by an automated control system. Its throughput 
capacity is about 150,000 units of containers and motor vehicles 
a year. 
  The Port of Odessa has rebuilt the Karantinniy 
mole, in the process of which deep-water berths were built to 
take large ships. Berth and rear container loaders have been 
installed there, and the area has been expanded and equipped to 
store the containers. As a result, the mole's throughput 
capacity is about 1.5 million tonnes of containerized cargo a 
year. 
  Two specialized berths are now in operation at the Port 
of Ilichevsk for container transshipment, with a throughput 
capacity of about 1 million tonnes of containerized cargo a year. 
  A special new berth to transship motor vehicle equipment was 
put into operation here in 1980. 
  The Port of Vostochnyy has three container berths. 
Another such deepwater berth is now being built. All four 
berths, each 300 m long, are designed to take (after dredging) 
container carriers with a 2,500 container capacity, but right 
now can take container carriers with a 1,200 container capacity 
and rolkers with a capacity of about 1,300 containers. Gantry 
loaders with a hoisting capacity of 30.5 tonnes each, with a 
rail width of 32 m, have been installed at the existing berths. 
Ten rows of containers are accommodated between the supports. 
The warehouses accommodate four rows of container stacks, 
serviced by gantry loaders. The total capacity of the warehouse 
areas at two berths is about 10,000 containers. 
  Containers are delivered to the port and shipped from it by 
railroad transport. A cargo front, serviced by double cantilever 
gantry cranes with a rail width of 25 m, have been provided to 
process the consists. The containers are moved by truck-tractor, 
along the area of the complex between the basic commercial 
facilities, on the port's semi-trailers. The semi-trailer is 
designed to transport containers weighing up to 35 tonnes. The 
container complex is computer-controlled. 
  A number of ports, including Vanino, Vladivostok, Nakhodka 
and others, are rebuilding berths to accept and process large 
container carriers. 
  Two container berths have been built at the Port of 
Magadan. One of them has a special warehouse to store 
containers, and is equipped with traveling bridges. This 
warehouse makes it possible to carry out cargo operations in any 
weather, which, under the conditions of the long and severe 
winter, is very important. 
<H5>  Special Berths To Transship Timber Cargoes </H5>
  Timber cargoes, mainly for export, are loaded at ports of 
the 
Northern basin (Arkhangelsk, Igarka), the Baltic basin (St. 
Petersburg, Vyborg, Kaliningrad), the Far Eastern basin 
(Vladivostok, Posyet, Nakhodka, Vanino and the port centers of 
the Amur estuary, as well as the port centers of Sakhalin and 
the Port of Ust-Kamchatka). 
  All these ports take small and medium-sized ships with a 
deadweight of up to 7,000 tonnes, and ports such as Arkhangelsk, 
Igarka, Vostochnyy, Nakhodka and Vanino -- large 
timber-carrier-pallet-carriers of the Nikolay Novikov type, with 
a deadweight of about 14,000 tonnes. 
  The following data characterize the rate of loading timber 
at 
the main ports: at the Port of Nakhodka -- saw logs in 
palletized form -- 1,700 t/ship-day, pulpwood (unpalletized) -- 
1,230 t/ship day; at the Port of Vostochnyy -- saw logs, 
palletized -- 2,060 t/ship-day; at the Port of Vyborg -- 
pulpwood (unpalletized) -- 2,000 t/ship-day. 
<H3>  Special Complexes To Transship Bulk Cargoes and Service 
Tankers </H3>
  The throughput capacities of the bulk oil complexes at 
seaports fully ensures the development of today's cargo 
turnover, with the exception of the oil-transshipment complex of 
the Port of Odessa, which needs to rebuild the berth 
structures, replace the pumping stations with more powerful 
equipment and deepen the access channel. 
  The largest bulk oil complex at the Port of 
Novorossiysk, Sheskharis, has deep-water berths, including 
one berth to accept and unload supertankers with a deadweight up 
to 200,000 tonnes. This berth can load the largest tankers of 
the Novorossiysk Shipping Company, of the Krym type, with a 
deadweight of 150,000 tonnes (draft 17 m), and combination ships 
(bulk tankers) with a deadweight of 100,000-110,000 tonnes 
(draft 15-17 m). The pumping system of this berth is designed to 
perform the loading of crude oil tankers with a productivity of 
about 20,000 t/hr. 
  The Tuapse seaport has six bulk berths, five of 
which can take tankers with a deadweight of from 10,000 to 
40,000 tonnes for loading, and one -- tankers with a deadweight 
of up to 50,000 tonnes. 
  The oil-transshipping complex of the Batumi 
seaport is designed to take tankers with a deadweight up to 
30,000 tonnes, and transships about 5 million tonnes of 
petroleum and petroleum products a year. 
  The oil-transshipping complex of the Port of 
Ventspils includes three bulk-oil piers (two berths at each 
one of them), which can take tankers of varying cargo capacity 
(two piers -- with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes and a 
third pier -- up to 100,000 tonnes). Liquefied petroleum gas is 
also shipped for export through this complex. 
  The Klaypeda seaport has three bulk berths, 
through which petroleum products are shipped on small and 
medium-sized tankers with a deadweight of up to 25,000 tonnes, 
and the cargo turnover is about 6 million tonnes a year. 
  The oil-transshipping complex of the Port of 
Nakhodka has four berths, two of which are for small ships 
and two for ships with a deadweight of 15,000 tonnes. 
  On the Caspian Sea, bulk oil cargoes are shipped via the 
ports of Makhachkala, Aktay, Krasnovodsk, Baku and Apsheron. 
  In addition to the two existing oil berths, the Port of 
Aktay has built two new berths with protecting structures, 
which has made it possible to increase the throughput capacity 
of the oil-transshipping complex from 5 million to 10 million 
tonnes a year. 
  According to statistical data, in 1990 the total dry cargo 
export of the Soviet Union republics was 75.7 million tonnes, 
including: Russia -- 52.1 (69 percent), Ukraine -- 18.6 (24.4 
percent), Belarus -- 1.58 (2.1 percent), Transcaucasus -- 1.59 
(2.2 percent) and Kazakhstan -- 1.2 million tonnes (1.5 percent). 
  Of this volume, 34.7 million tonnes (46 percent) were 
shipped 
through Russian ports, and, moreover, its own share was 31.4 (90 
percent), the Ukrainian share 2.2 (6.3 percent), Belarusian -- 
0.3 (1 percent); 29.2 (38.5 percent) was shipped through 
Ukrainian ports, and in this case Russia's share was 12.2 (41.7 
percent), Ukraine's -- 14.9 (51.5 percent), Belarusia's -- 1.1 
(3.9 percent), Transcaucasus' -- 0.4 (1.3 percent) and 
Kazakhstan's -- 0.3 million tonnes (1.1 percent). 
  Of the total amount of Russian dry cargo export, the 
following commodities were transshipped through Ukrainian ports: 
coal -- 3.5 million tonnes, chemicals -- 3.4, metals -- 2.5, 
machines and equipment -- 0.44, ore -- 0.35 and other products 
-- 1.6 million tonnes. 
  In 1990, about 8 million tonnes of dry cargo from Russia 
were 
exported through ports of the Baltic republics, including coal 
-- 2.7, chemicals -- 2.3, others, including metals and cement -- 
about 3 million tonnes. 
  Of the total volume of dry cargo import in 1990, Russia 
accounted for 28.9 million tonnes (45.8 percent), and, moreover, 
13.7 million tonnes were processed through its ports, 8.8 -- 
through the ports of Ukraine and 6.4 million tonnes through the 
ports of the Baltic republics. Predominant in the composition of 
Russian dry cargo import arriving through Ukrainian ports were 
grain -- 3.3 million tonnes, sugar -- 0.7, metals -- 1.6, 
chemicals -- 0.25, machines and equipment -- 0.56, combined 
feeds -- 0.5 and perishable goods -- 0.24 million tonnes. The 
import of dry cargo for Russia coming through Baltic ports 
consisted mainly of grain -- 3 million tonnes, perishables -- 
0.4, combined feeds -- 0.4 and also metals, machinery and 
equipment -- 0.5 million tonnes. 
  Because of the breakup of the USSR, to export these volumes 
of dry cargoes from Russia, the throughput capacities of the 
Black Sea Ports are lacking -- 12.2 million tonnes, the Baltic 
ports -- 8, and for import -- the Black Sea -- 8.8 and the 
Baltic -- 6.2 million tonnes. According to the predictions of 
Soyuzmorniiproyekt, the volume of Russian dry cargo import in 
the next few years should increase from 28.9 to 42.5 million 
tonnes, mainly due to grain -- 11.1, and sugar -- 3.2 million 
tonnes. No increase is envisioned in dry cargo export volume. 
Measures must therefore be worked out to develop the throughput 
capacity of Russia's ports, both in the near future and in the 
future up to the year 2000. 
  In 1980, Russia exported 96.2 million tonnes of bulk cargo 
through its seaports, of which 42.5 million were transshipped 
through seaports on the Black Sea -- Novorossiysk and Tuapse, 
21.8 million -- the ports of Ukraine, and 30 million -- the 
Baltic ports. According to predictions, a sharp cutback in the 
export of petroleum and petroleum products is proposed from both 
Russia and other oil-extracting republics. Because of this, 
there is no need to develop oil ports on the Black Sea. On the 
Baltic, however, the need obviously arises to build a bulk port 
or use the ports of Ventspils and Klaypeda under certain 
conditions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jamal Kadyr, by Vladimir Mikhaylov; date and </F>
place not given: "What the Kurds Are Fighting For"] 
  [Text] As if conspiratorially, the news media, the 
public of the majority of democratic countries, and 
international organizations are silent about the genocide 
against the Kurds and this people's heroic struggle. RABOCHAYA 
TRIBUNA observer Vladimir Mikhaylov interviews Jamal Kadyr, 
representative of the Kurdistan National Liberation Front in the 
CIS countries. 
  [Mikhaylov] I fear that our readers are not all that well 
acquainted either with the Kurds themselves or with the Kurdish 
problem--Soviet and, subsequently, Russian newspapers 
practically ignored this question. Could you not for a start, 
therefore, briefly identify this problem? 
  [Kadyr] Happily. According to one version, the Kurds came to 
Asia from northern Europe and occupied the territory between the 
present Iran and Turkey 1,000 years before the birth of Christ. 
They fought for approximately four centuries, and it was only in 
612 B.C.E. that they formed their own state. And, as is usual in 
ancient history, there were numerous victories and defeats, and 
states broke up and took shape. 
  In our century, even the territory of Kurdistan in Western 
Asia has been divided among Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, and 
we have since that time been fighting for the creation of a 
unified and independent state. This struggle is being conducted 
by the National Liberation Front under the leadership of the 
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 
  [Mikhaylov] Does the liberation movement adhere to a common 
strategy and tactics in all four areas? 
  [Kadyr] No. In Iraqi Kurdistan, the struggle began in 1960, 
but, unfortunately, it was conducted not for freedom and 
independence but for the right of autonomy. When this autonomy 
was promised, therefore, the Iraqi Kurds came to trust the 
country's leadership. As a result, Baghdad needed have no fear 
of them and was able to concentrate fully on the war with Iran. 
When the war was over, however, the Iraqi Army, like the Iranian 
Army also, for that matter, struck at the Kurds--1,400 villages 
were destroyed, and 600,000 refugees left their homes, and the 
rest were herded into strategic localities. 
  All weapons, chemical weapons included, have been used 
against the Kurds. 
  In 1991, when Operation Desert Storm was conducted against 
Baghdad, the Kurds once again acquired the possibility of 
struggle. But this did not suit the United States, and it 
afforded Iraq the opportunity to deliver new attacks on our 
brothers--184,000 persons died, and new hundreds of thousands 
became refugees. Washington is playing a double game here: In 
order to keep Baghdad in check it is ostensibly supporting the 
Kurds, but as soon as they begin to gain strength, it washes its 
hands of them, affording the Iraqi Army an opportunity to smash 
them. 
  The situation is roughly the same in Iran also, and this is 
why the national liberation movement is extremely weak in these 
countries and is winning practically no victories. But until 
1983 quite a few provinces were under the control of the Kurds 
there. But after the Khomeyni regime had become entrenched, 
these provinces once again reverted fully to Tehran. In Syria 
the situation is different: No guerrilla struggle has been 
conducted since 1969--we see a peaceful, democratic solution of 
this problem there. And the most tense situation, the most 
brutal genocide against our people, the most bitter war, 
exceeding considerably in its intensity what is happening in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, is in Northern Kurdistan--on the 
territory of Turkey. 
  [Mikhaylov] Judging by the brief wire reports, Turkish 
troops 
are pursuing the Kurds beyond this territory also. There was, 
for example, a report on mass bombing to which Turkish aircraft 
subjected camps on the territory of Iraq, going to a depth of 
110 km. 
  [Kadyr] Were this an isolated action! But such bombing raids 
and other crimes of the Turkish military are merely links in an 
endless chain of inhuman actions aimed at the extermination of 
an entire people. Nor does Ankara conceal this, for that matter, 
cynically declaring: "No more Kurds, no more problem." 
  Hundreds of examples of genocide could be adduced. Let us 
begin with the fact that throughout its history, Turkish 
television has not uttered a single word in Kurdish, and the 
schools teach only in Turkish, and until recently the students 
were forced to say daily: "By nationality I am a Turk, my father 
is Ataturk, Turkey is a country in which only Turks live." 
  As far as the punitive measures are concerned, more than 
3,700 villages and towns have been destroyed, over 12,000 
peaceful inhabitants killed, and approximately 9 million persons 
have become refugees in nine years in Turkish Kurdistan. When 
the troops conduct punitive operations, they do not select their 
targets, and old men, women, and young children die, therefore. 
They kill journalists and members of the Majlis (the Turkish 
parliament). Deputy Mahmad Sanjar, together with two other 
members of parliament, went on 4 September of last year to the 
city of Batman to take part in a funeral ceremony. As they were 
walking along the street in broad daylight, three Turkish 
"contra-guerrillas" (members of anti-guerrilla subunits) came 
running up to them and opened fire from assault rifles. Mahmad 
Sanjar was killed instantly, and another deputy was wounded. 
  The authorities are afraid of the truth, and this is why 
journalists are their victims. Nine reporters and 16 employees 
of the newspaper OGYUR GYUNDAM (Free Agenda), which is published 
in Turkish, have been killed in recent times. The People's Labor 
Party--legal--has 18 seats in the Majlis. But 48 of this party's 
activists have been killed--and the "contra-guerrillas" operate 
absolutely in the open, in broad daylight, in Turkey, what is 
more, and never cover their faces with masks. 
  You began your question with a mention of the recent bombing 
of Kurdish camps. But here is an example of the destruction of a 
town in which there were members neither of the PKK nor of the 
National Liberation Front. On 22 October 1993, Turkish soldiers 
surrounded the town of Lidc, in which all the structures were 
wooden, and began firing from artillery weapons and tanks. And 
then aircraft swooped down on the town, using napalm. The town 
was razed completely. The surviving inhabitants were shot, as, 
for example, were 27 older pupils right in the school building. 
  [Mikhaylov] This is all about punitive measures and 
genocide. 
But you said that a bitter war is being fought in Northern 
Kurdistan. Has the liberation movement scored any successes? 
  [Kadyr] The armed struggle has been under way for more than 
nine years here. We did not want to fight, but we were forced 
into it, and even our unilateral cease-fire, which lasted 83 
days and demonstrated the sincerity of our proposal concerning a 
peaceful settlement of the problem, met with no response from 
Ankara. 
  When we began our struggle, Turkish propaganda declared that 
it was a "handful of terrorists who had arrived from outside" 
and that "they would be finished off in 72 hours, at the most." 
The number of guerrillas today constitutes 15,000. In addition, 
there are 30,000 militia officers who have undergone training 
and who have returned to their villages and towns. They are 
prepared at any moment to take up arms and sometimes perform 
special assignments after the working day. There is fighting 
today on approximately 15 fronts. I can responsibly say that in 
the political, economic, and military respects, practically all 
areas are in our hands. There are places where we are the 
masters at night, but which we have to leave in the daytime. But 
in 1994 we will go over to a decisive offensive against the 
Turkish garrisons in the towns and will force them out of 
Kurdistan for good. 
  [Mikhaylov] What kind of weapons are you using, and where do 
they come from? 
  [Kadyr] Small guerrilla arms, in the main. For defense we 
have a certain quantity of large-caliber air defense machine 
guns and Stinger SAM-type missiles and grenade launchers. These 
are essential for defending our bases in the mountains. From 
where do we get them? Today, when almost the entire region of 
the Near and Middle East is in the grip of wars, buying any 
weapons is not a problem. The money for the guerrillas' needs 
comes from our people. 
  [Mikhaylov] In conclusion let us, if possible, talk a little 
about the fate of the Kurds who lived on the territory of the 
Soviet Union. It is well known that in 1923, on the initiative 
of V.I. Lenin, an autonomous region--Red Kurdistan--was formed 
on the land of Azerbaijan. Seven years later, in connection with 
the new administrative division, it was converted into Kurdistan 
Okrug, and several months later it vanished from the country's 
political map altogether. In 1937 the Kurds were deported from 
Azerbaijan and Armenia. Seven years later the same fate befell 
the Kurds in Georgia. What can be said about the position of 
your brothers today? 
  [Kadyr] Truly, when Kurdistan was divided into four parts, 
many Kurds found refuge in the Soviet Union. Under the 
conditions of the autonomy they were able to develop their 
culture and traditions there. Alas, this soon came to an end. 
Today, despite the fact that there is practically no information 
in Russia and the other republics of the CIS about our life and 
problems, we have opportunities for the development of our 
culture and language and can create committees and associations, 
put out newspapers and journals, and publish books. A special 
place in the fate of the Kurds has been and is now occupied by 
Russia, where the majority of refugees found refuge. We would 
once again have acquired autonomy, probably, but.... 
  [Mikhaylov] Yes, this is a distressing business. The Supreme 
Soviet of the former USSR, taking account of the situation in 
which the Kurds, like other small peoples also, had found 
themselves, formed a commission for restoration of the autonomy. 
But fate played a cruel trick: The Soviet Union ceased to exist, 
and the commission became legally null and void. Its three years 
of work were of no use to anyone, and the Kurds became citizens 
of different states of the CIS. Do you have a sense of 
hopelessness? 
  [Kadyr] No. First, we are sure that an independent Kurdish 
state will shortly emerge on the territory of Turkey. Second, we 
believe in Russia and see a desire to help those of us living on 
its land in every possible way. We have been afforded every 
opportunity for development, and Kurds here have never felt that 
their rights have been infringed and have not seen the least 
signs of discrimination. But as far as the national liberation 
struggle of the Kurds outside of the CIS is concerned, Russia 
has in this respect inherited the Soviet policy, when Moscow 
played up to the bourgeois parties of the countries in which 
parts of Kurdistan are located. It is essential that Russia 
today look at this problem with new eyes and understand that the 
war being conducted by the Kurds and the creation of an 
independent state are fully in keeping with Russia's interests. 
It is essential to break with the old ideas and see that 
Kurdistan serves as an additional guarantee of the defense of 
Russia's borders and the borders of the entire CIS. After all, 
it is no accident that the United States and the West are 
supporting in this way their loyal NATO ally--Turkey.

<F P=106> [Article: "Once More About the Russian-Georgian Treaty: The </F>
Duma Committee for CIS Affairs Reaches Conclusions: The 
Document" 
  [Text] Having attentively studied in the course of closed 
parliamentary hearings the Russian-Georgian treaty acts that 
were signed on 9 October 1993 in Moscow and on 3 February 1994 
in Tbilisi, and having heard the opinions of officials, deputies 
of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, experts and 
consultants, and representatives of the Georgian, South Ossetian 
and Abkhazian sides, the Committee for CIS Affairs and Relations 
With Fellow Countrymen came to the following conclusions: 
  1. ...In recognizing the territorial integrity of the 
Republic of Georgia on several occasions in the text of the 
treaty and in other agreements, the parties base themselves on 
ideas about the territory of the former Georgian Soviet 
Socialist Republic. There is no doubt of this, and the hearing 
once again confirmed this. Inasmuch as the Georgian side is not 
in control of the situation on a significant part of the 
territory of the former GSSR, we are unable to count on 
Georgia's fulfillment of all of its treaty obligations. It was 
noted on several occasions that unless the problems of Georgia's 
internal structure are settled, and unless there are guarantees 
of full and honorable resolution of the Abkhazian and South 
Ossetian problems, which generated bloody conflicts involving 
many of our fellow countrymen in the recent past, some articles 
of the treaty (chiefly articles 3 and 4) will, in the event of 
its ratification, impose a unilateral obligation on Russia to 
arm the Georgian side, support its attempts to regain control 
over lost regions, and cut off attempts to assist them (the 
regions.--NG) from Russian territory in the event of escalation 
of the military conflict. We must note that by accepting 
obligations before Georgia in the Caucasus that would be 
difficult to fulfill even for Russia, we lose the trust of the 
other parties to the conflict, and do damage to our intermediary 
peacekeeping mission. 
  ...We reject the capability of the Georgian side to 
guarantee 
strict fulfillment of the provisions of the treaty regarding 
nontransfer of armament and military equipment and technology to 
third parties. 
  ...The members of the committee support the oral statement 
by 
RF President B. N. Yeltsin regarding postponement of submission 
of the treaty, signed on 3 February 1994, for ratification to 
the Federal Assembly until the conflicts in Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia are settled. What we cannot understand in any way is 
this: For what purpose is Russia, as represented by its supreme 
official, to sign the new treaty, which the president does not 
intend to submit for ratification, before such a settlement is 
reached, before Russian demarcation forces are introduced on the 
line of confrontation along the Ingura River, and before the 
earlier treaty between Russian and Georgia dated 9 October 1993 
is submitted for ratification? 
  ...2. What raises certain concerns in the Committee for CIS 
Affairs is not the fact itself that besides the treaty an entire 
list of Russian-Georgian agreements have been signed, including 
many that are useful and necessary, but that they are not being 
examined as supplements to and a consequence of the Treaty on 
Friendship, Good-Neighbor Relations and Cooperation that was 
concurrently signed and is now subject to ratification. As an 
example these agreements also include ones like the "Agreement 
on the Status and Conditions of Operation of Russian Border 
Troops Located in the Georgian Republic," which foresees 
transfer of real and movable military property, assistance in 
personnel training and so on. Members of the committee did not 
receive an answer in the course of the hearings to the question 
as to why Article 33 of this agreement, in contrast to the 
analogous article of the concurrently signed treaty, foresees 
its enactment "from the day of exchange of written certificates 
of fulfillment of internal government procedures by the Parties 
necessary for its enactment," rather than making a direct 
reference to the need for its ratification. 
  ...All the committee has in this regard is the "Protocol on 
the Meeting of Delegations of the RF and the Georgian Republic," 
signed on 3 February of this year by P. Grachev and O. 
Patsatsiya. The protocol, which requires no ratification, 
documents only the principle of creating Russian military bases 
in the Georgian Republic. It is known from statements made at 
the hearings by the RF minister of defense and representatives 
of the Defense Ministry that the reference is to the bases in 
Vaziani, Akhalkalaki and Batumi, with the latter to have 
branches in Gudauty and Sukhumi. The Abkhazian Supreme Council 
has already declared that it does not recognize any agreements 
of which it is not a participant in regard to territory under 
its control (that is, Gudauty and Sukhumi). 
  ...3. Examining the general problems of the Russian-Georgian 
agreements, the Committee for CIS Affairs notes that 
speculations regarding a unilateral advantage for Russia in the 
signed Russian-Georgian treaty acts do not withstand criticism. 
The economic assistance provided to the government of the 
Georgian Republic, which is increasing the amount of Russia's 
internal government debt, cannot as yet be estimated in absolute 
figures because we do not have data by which to appraise the 
value of buildings and structures being transferred to the 
Georgian Republic, the prices of the military equipment, arms 
and technology, the cost of leasing military facilities on 
Georgian territory and so on. Implementation of the agreements 
will mean reduction of Russian military presence in Georgia. No 
matter how some superficial conclusions in the press may try to 
make us believe the reverse, replacement of Russian divisions in 
Akhalkalaki and Batumi by regiments can in no way be said to be 
an expansion of military presence. As for growth of our military 
influence as a result of equipment deliveries and personnel 
training, the history of Russia and the USSR contains many cases 
in which equipment and personnel that we trained were used 
against us (German armament in the 1920s-1930s, assistance to 
the People's Republic of China after the Second World War, and 
so on.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Anin: "P.S."] </F>
  [Text] Although the parliamentary Committee for CIS Affairs 
of the new convocation has only quite recently become a subject 
of big politics, and did not take part in the predatory 
military-political operation, with an Abkhazian leaning, for the 
"voluntary" inclusion of Georgia in the Commonwealth, the 
document presented above fits well into the known concept of 
Russian policy regarding relations with nations from the new 
frontier. Specifically, those who resisted to the last the 
incorporation of post-Soviet space into the sphere of Moscow's 
vital interests. Even more specifically, that same Georgia. 
  When we distill from it the acid syrup of diplomacy and 
analyze the dry residue of the real policy, this cunning concept 
reduces to two or three mundane formulas: 1. If some independent 
state does not wish to enter the sphere of Russian interests on 
its own, then it should be compelled to do so through economic 
influence or by bringing up military-political arguments. 2. 
After this, it would be preferable to structure relations with 
such an independent state in such a way that a) it would have 
the appearance of a gesture of good will, b) it would secure for 
Moscow the right of primarily military presence on designated 
territory, and c) it would postpone distribution of rewards for 
loyalty to some indefinitely remote future. 3. The ultimate 
objective would be a state of affairs under which the content of 
item 2 is perceived by public opinion as incredible generosity 
on Russia's part, bordering on extravagance. It wouldn't be 
difficult to note that the statement of the Duma's Committee for 
CIS Affairs provides for implementation of item 3, which is 
essentially an ideological cover for actions it itself 
criticizes. 
  After all, the reason the president signed a treaty which he 
doesn't intend to submit for ratification is that for Moscow, 
this document is but formal confirmation of the new geopolitical 
reality in relations with Georgia: It in no way ensures equal 
cooperation and Russia's fulfillment of its obligations of 
reviving the Georgian economy and supporting the national 
integrity of the Republic of Georgia. 
  The reason why the "Grachev-Patsatsiya Protocol" is not 
subject to ratification but becomes effective directly is that 
it discusses some very serious things--establishing Russian 
military bases on Georgian territory. (Only Georgia of the three 
Transcaucasian republics is objectively capable of serving as a 
strongpoint for Russian influence in the region. Neither 
Azerbaijan nor Armenia is fit for this role, first 
geographically and second because in the context of the 
permanent Karabakh crisis Moscow has been pursuing a "pendulum 
policy" in its relations with the warring sides for a long time. 
And alternating manipulation by the carrot and the stick doesn't 
favor establishment of a dependable, permanent 
military-political beachhead on these territories.) What is 
important is not what is being substituted--regiments for 
divisions or armies for regiments (by the way, what is important 
in these things is not the number of personnel but the nature of 
their combat use and the quality of their training): The main 
thing is that Moscow now has the legal right to maintain a 
military presence in Georgia. 
  As for possible use of equipment supplied by Russia and 
personnel trained by Russia against Russia, the concern 
expressed by the Committee for CIS Affairs in this regard 
appears fully justified. Pharisaism is all right as long as it 
doesn't transform from a spicy complement to political soup into 
total policy. Then the burdened and humbled people will begin to 
resist, giving no thought to who gave them the weapons and who 
taught them how to use them.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Stroganov under the "Neighboring Countries" </F>
rubric: "Ukrainian and Lithuanian Politicians Dream of 
Baltic-Black Sea Alliance"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- The signing of a treaty on friendship 
and cooperation between Lithuania and Ukraine, which took place 
during Leonid Kravchuk's recent visit to Vilnius, did not simply 
open up intrinsically new prospects in the relations between the 
two independent states. The spirit of a so-called Baltic-Black 
Sea alliance hovered in the lobbies of the Seimas where the 
meetings took place. The first step has been taken. 
  The curtain was raised a fraction on the eve of Leonid 
Kravchuk's visit by Rostislav Bilodid, Ukrainian ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Lithuania. He said: "I am 
a supporter of a Baltic-Black Sea alliance, but would not like 
to narrow this to just a political concept. I interpret it more 
widely. After all, there is so much in common in the characters 
of our people. In short, we should be closer to one another. 
Ukraine is committed to cooperation with Lithuania." 
  In the ambassador's opinion, both countries jave a lot of 
work to do in the economic sphere. Today Lithuania's share of 
exports to Ukraine stands at 8-10 percent. This is too small, 
R. Bilodid noted. Ukraine, in his opinion, should become a 
profitable export market for Lithuania. In his view, this 
republic has hitherto focused too little attention on the region 
to its south. Specific steps have already been taken. 
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys and Rostislav Bilodid 
have initialed a treaty between the two countries' governments 
on encouraging investments and providing bilateral export 
guarantees. 
  Leonid Kravchuk also assigned a special role to economic 
relations in his speech to the Lithuanian Seimas. In his 
opinion, economic and trade links have not attained the 
necessary level. Both countries could cooperate with mutual 
profit in any sphere. The Ukrainian president offered to export 
to Lithuania ores, coal, coke, rolled iron, metal goods, 
electrotechnical instruments, and cars. In its turn Ukraine 
would like to receive from Lithuania consumer goods, footwear, 
clothing, and chemical and electronics industry products. There 
are big opportunities for cooperation in the field of transport. 
Ukraine would like to have access to the Baltic Sea and to 
other North European countries via the port of Klaipeda. 
Lithuania, Leonid Kravchuk proposed, could also take advantage 
of the potential of Ukraine's Black Sea ports. 
  It is clearly not easy to implement such an extensive 
cooperation program in the context of "conventional" agreements. 
Hence politicians in both countries have seized on the idea of 
creating an alliance. At any rate, neither Leonid Kravchuk nor 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas denied this idea at the 
press conference held after the signing of the friendship and 
cooperation treaty. True, Leonid Kravchuk did stress that the 
talk of an alliance meant not military blocs of any kind but 
only cooperation in the sphere of economics and culture. And 
Algirdas Brazauskaks added that such initiatives in no way 
denoted the formation of military blocs; on the contrary, they 
were a step toward pan-European cooperation on security matters. 
Both presidents give a high assessment to the "Partnership for 
Peace" program recently signed by Lithuania. Here the idea of 
an alliance between Baltic and Black Sea countries takes on a 
whole new aspect. Leonid Kravchuk recalled Ukraine's initiative 
on the creation of stability zones in regions of Central and 
East Europe. He expects it to cover all countries in the Baltic 
and Black Sea regions. This initiative, the Ukrainian president 
said, coincides with other security system projects. It was 
noted at the press conference that the initiative for forming a 
Baltic-Black Sea alliance is supported by Poland, France, and 
other countries. 
  Thus it would appear that the idea of an alliance has more 
than just an economic content. For example, Leonid Kravchuk 
noted that Ukraine is connected with the Lithuanian people 
historically; the roots of this friendship go back into the 
distant past. Cooperation began as far back as the days of 
Kievan Rus, which played a large part in Lithuania's formation. 
"In its turn the Great Lithuanian Principality of the 14th 
century helped Ukrainians to preserve their traditions, 
language, and religion and did not allow that unique culture to 
die," Leonid Kravchuk said. "At that time our countries were 
part of a single state, and deep ties were formed between our 
peoples which today are taking on a new significance." 
  Such good relations with Lithuania could not help provoking 
questions about relations between Ukraine and Russia. Leonid 
Kravchuk expressed the conviction that, if his country adheres 
to the trilateral agreement on nuclear weapons signed in Moscow, 
friendly relations will not change. At the same time he singled 
out the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, which in his opinion has 
to be resolved before there can be any question of discussing a 
solution to other problems. Relations with Russia, he said, 
have a special significance in our foreign policy, and they will 
have a real content if good will is shown on both the Ukrainian 
and Russian sides. 
  The idea of a Baltic-Black Sea alliance probably suits the 
hearts and minds of the Lithuanian opposition, which fervently 
opposes any alliances with Russia. Thus Vytautas Landsbergis 
described Leonid Kravchuk's visit to Lithuania as "the summit of 
today's actualities." "We have long understood that Ukraine's 
fate is also vitally important to Lithuania's independence," the 
Lithuanian opposition leader stressed. "Today Ukraine is 
seeking support, and it is important for us to support that 
aspiration."

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Gonchar (chairman of the Federation </F>
Council Committee for the Budget, Financial, Currency, and 
Credit Regulation, Monetary Emission, Tax Policy, and Customs 
Regulation) by Vladimir Kuzmishchev; place and date not given: 
"Nikolay Gonchar: No Alternative to Unification"] 
  [Text] 
  [Kuzmishchev] Nikolay Nikolayevich, I recently heard that 
you are calling for economic reunification with Ukraine in 
connection with the situation in the Crimea. To be honest my 
first thought is God forbid. Loss-making mines in the Donbass, 
exhausted mines in the Krivoy Rog area, the mighty defense 
industry in Dnepropetrovsk in need of restructuring. We just 
won't be able to cope.... 
  [Gonchar] Imagine that a third of the modules are removed 
from your computer here and you are asked: How are we to get it 
to work? Simple. You either replace the parts that have been 
removed with some new components, which is a costly, awkward, 
and exacting business. Or you put back the old ones. Then you 
can use the computer. 
  [Kuzmishchev] That is debatable. It transpires that Ukraine 
produced 18 percent of the former Union's GNP. Some went on 
reproduction and on intrarepublic deliveries, some to Central 
Asia, Georgia, and the Baltic. And, no matter how you look at 
it, Russia's dependency on Ukraine was minimal. But Ukraine 
experienced maximum dependency on Russia, as the last few years 
have shown. 
  [Gonchar] Now let us give the people of Tyumen a say from 
these positions. They say that the whole Russian economy has 
been shored up and still is being shored up with their 
petrodollars and gas dollars, and you can wash your hands of and 
forget the rest. Let them survive on their own. It will end up 
with neither one thing nor the other. The system can be 
restructured or, to continue the computer analogy, a new program 
loaded. But why destroy things? 
  [Kuzmishchev] But political realities must be taken into 
consideration.... 
  [Gonchar] The former political system turned out to be 
fiction. If it could collapse because of a conflict between two 
leaders, it did not exist. I suggest that we evaluate reality. 
The reality is that borders which were established in an 
extremely arbitrary manner in the past (everyone was after all 
convinced that they were a formality) suddenly proved real. So 
far only economically, but the logic of confrontation is not 
always the logic of common sense. It dictates its own laws. 
Border guards carrying assault rifles have already appeared. 
The absurd thing is that a person's membership of a particular 
nation is only decided by geographical latitude and longitude.... 
  [Kuzmishchev] You have been able to say things to me a 
journalist that you cannot say as a politician. Having traveled 
the entire length and breadth of Left Bank Ukraine I was never 
able to understand how the thinking, lifestyle, psychology, or, 
as people are now saying, the mentality of a peasant, a miner, 
an engineer in those areas differs from the mentality of someone 
from Tula, Saratov, Omsk, or Minsk, say. There has never been a 
language barrier. It was harder for me to understand, say, what 
a coastal dweller from Arkhangelsk was saying than a peasant 
from Kharkov. According to Dal [19th century Russian 
ethnographer] a person belongs to the nationality in whose 
language he thinks. Second, what have the millions of Russians 
who came from Russia to Ukraine or to Kazakhstan on an institute 
placement or in response to the authorities' appeal done to hurt 
us? By political realities I meant the situation today. 
  [Gonchar] The saying that politics is economics in a 
concentrated form is more appropriate today than ever. Economic 
integration represents the means of survival for us. There is a 
cheap work force in Ukraine. Tell me please how we will be able 
to stem the flow of people from there who are desperate to come 
to our country to work? They are even willing to take half pay, 
but what are we to do with our own people? This threatens a 
social explosion. Now let us take the situation in the Crimea. 
The recently elected president Yu. Meshkov was the leader of 
the "Russia" bloc, A fairly eloquent name. Their objective is 
to leave the economic wreckage of Ukraine and form a single 
economic area with Russia and other states. Russia now seems to 
be accommodating that aspiration. But there are many problems 
here. We do not after all even share borders. Electricity comes 
from Ukraine as does the water for agricultural irrigation, and 
so on. The Crimea is greatly indebted to Ukraine. What will 
happen to Left Bank Ukraine where there are similar pro-Russian 
sentiments? But no one there is advocating the revival of the 
Soviet and Socialist Union. It is a question of economic 
integration. 
  [Kuzmishchev] The chain reaction will hit Kazakhstan next. 
Whereas the breakup of the Union caused a series of wars in 
outlying regions, the breakup of Ukraine and Kazakhstan would 
mean.... 
  [Gonchar] There are plenty of politicians in Ukraine and our 
country who would not be averse to playing that card. Both in 
order to remain in big-league politics and in order to reach new 
heights. Suppose someone in Ukraine wanted to postpone 
parliamentary and presidential elections. Is the possible 
deterioration of the situation in the Crimea not an excuse for 
those politicians? And aren't our radicals even better? 
  [Kuzmishchev] But doesn't integration involve a partial loss 
of sovereignty for states with a weaker economy? 
  [Gonchar] Sovereignty is not the aim, but the means of 
attaining contemporary civilization and a high standard of 
living. People in Ukraine were convinced that autonomy is the 
way to success. Now the result is clear. No one on the 
long-established Western market is waiting for us or for them. 
Look how quick they were to reach agreement with us and drive 
down prices of aluminum and oil. We thought that we would 
inundate the West with these goods and take off like the Arab 
Emirates did in the past. That is not the case. Besides, it 
is offensive if you have high technologies to place the emphasis 
on raw materials when all countries are trying to sell finished 
output. But for the time being we are prepared to trade 
finished output mainly among ourselves.... 
  [Kuzmishchev] But how specifically are the first steps to be 
taken? How long has there been talk of creating a ruble zone at 
the highest level and it has all been to no avail.... 
  [Gonchar] The key issue here is the number of money supply 
centers. Needless to say, Russia will never agree to there 
being several points deciding the money supply. There must only 
be one of these points. Europe has already reached that 
conclusion -- a currency institution has been set up there and 
it will have a single currency. Why are our politicians 
opposing proposals dictated by life itself? Remember the 
advertisement that begins with the words: "Ladies and 
Gentlemen, you have 30 seconds to think about it...." There are 
no deals that are any easier or granders han those involved in 
playing with exchange rate differences and brokering currency 
transfers. This is a colossal network and can produce billions 
out of thin air. On the one hand, these billions affect prime 
cost and thus bring soaring prices and inflation, on the other, 
they require political protection and lobbying for their 
interests. I therefore propose that, if the politicians do not 
reach agreement, let the peoples reach agreement. The 
politicians must be presented with the fait accompli of the 
peoples having reached agreement. Let us hold a referendum. 
With one sole question: Is it necessary to create a single 
economic area? 
  [Kuzmishchev] The population of Ukraine will probably vote 
"for," but Russia is another matter. What a hullabaloo there 
has been over the creation of a single monetary system with 
Belarus. But here, after all, the scale is far greater. And the 
political forces of those opposed are far more aggressive. It 
will be enough for someone in Russia say that this will whip up 
inflation, and then.... 
  [Gonchar] If you so desire, shortcomings can be found, 
exaggerated, and dreamed up in any plan, any idea. Let us first 
grasp what is meant by "unification" [obyedineniye] or the 
creation of a "single economic area," the specific steps 
involved. 
  There are of course plenty of people in our country, in 
Ukraine, and in Kazakhstan whose political career is based on 
the policy of separation [razyedininiye]. Many people are only 
interested in nationalist hysteria so that they can come to 
power. Some individuals have already succeeded, but the parade 
of sovereignty indisputably had adverse consequences for most of 
the population. At the same time we have enough sober 
politicians who are capable of telling people that economic 
integration by no means signifies that Russia will include 
Ukraine in its budget and exchange rubles for coupons on a 1:1 
basis. 
  [Kuzmishchev] What does it mean then? 
  [Gonchar] Primarily that the economic and legal barriers 
should be taken down and the duties removed. And private 
capital given the freedom to invest money in the Ukrainian 
economy. 
  [Kuzmishchev] But, as Marx said, capital is not sentimental, 
it goes where there is the greatest profit. It is hard in 
Russia to force someone to invest in production in conditions of 
inflation, never mind in Ukraine. 
  [Gonchar] A contentious issue. Even from the purely 
economic viewpoint. You only have to remember Ukraine's mighty 
oil refining industry, which is driving down our monopolists' 
prices. Anyone with a reasonable knowledge of the Ukrainian 
economy can name straight off several sectors in which it is 
profitable to invest capital. That is not the point. 
Entrepreneurs are primarily interested in political stability 
and legal protection. Russian firms, say, are willing to refine 
oil in Ukraine, but what guarantee is there that Ukraine won't 
appropriate the oil tomorrow? There must be seamless 
[skvoznoye] legislation on property. 
  [Kuzmishchev] Common legislation. 
  (Gonchar] No. Ukrainian and Russian legislation. The main 
thing is that the laws should not contradict one another. In a 
word, there must be an incentive for a change of legislation. 
If you want to employ an incentive, then think it through. 
Capital, I repeat, goes where there is greater social and 
political stability. If we squabble, there will be no capital. 
That is, the economic motor is cranked into action via 
politics. And, on the contrary, every stage of political 
rapprochement must have legal and political backup. Let us give 
Russian and Ukrainian capital a chance to work together. If it 
is just a question of Russian capital, there is one system of 
taxation, if it is just Ukrainian, then another applies. But if 
it is a joint project, there must be lenient taxes to provide 
incentives. It is not important what language people speak. Or 
what they wear. They will be united by profit and a common 
cause. When people come along and undermine the common cause 
out of personal interest, Russian businessmen will tell their 
Ukrainian colleagues: The plan will collapse if this idiot 
forces the situation. Would you be so kind as to have it out 
with him. Give money to his election rival, give money to the 
party that backs integrationist processes and we will deal with 
our Russian loonies. People of the same blood must be united 
by common interests. 
  [Kuzmishchev] Do you think that this is the most pressing 
problem now? 
  [Gonchar] Why has the rich United States suddenly taken the 
initiative and started strengthening the economy of Mexico? 
Mexicans were dying to get across the border, so economic 
potential had to be created there. The situation is far more 
acute in our country. Things are so bad in Ukraine that an 
explosion may be about to occur. We are hoping in vain that the 
debris will only fly inward. There is no alternative to 
economic integration. People in the Crimea have realized that 
and are clearing the way. The others are only hampered by the 
fact that some politicians in both capitals are afraid to 
acknowledge their mistakes, which have brought national tragedy.

`Transparent' Border"] 
  [Text] Control was maintained 
in its full volume for 4 days at international checkpoints on 
the Russian-Azeri border. After the experiment the border guards 
decided that a stricter regime was needed in the Dagestan 
section. 
  Major General Aleksandr Baranov, the deputy chief of main 
staff of the RF Border Troops, is certain that channels of 
illegal crossings of people and cargo over the Azeri border with 
Iran and Turkey exist. Just in those 4 days when the border 
checks were made more carefully, 57 violators from Iran, Iraq, 
Turkey and Pakistan were detained attempting to penetrate 
illegally into the Russian Federation through Azerbaijan and 
bring in tons of smuggled goods. Border troops confiscated 
44,500 bottles of alcoholic beverages. Smugglers attempted to 
take 200 refrigerators out of Russia. 
  Two Russian border detachments, Nakhichevan and Lenkoran, 
which were withdrawn from Azerbaijan in 1992, are now stationed 
in the cities of Makhachkala and Derbent. All of last year the 
border troops busied themselves with their own accommodation. 
Control of the Russian-Azeri border, which runs along the Samur 
River, was selective. But now they are ready to begin serving 
full time. 
  This OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent was told by the press 
service of the Russian Border Troops that stricter control 
shouldn't create any obstacles to border crossings by citizens 
of the CIS. However, contrary to the assertions, now that the 
status of the border is changing, the procedure for crossing 
into a contiguous country will be as close as it can to the 
regulations existing on Russia's borders with countries of the 
far frontier. Which means a lot of red tape. Moreover, how they 
intend to solve the problem of the Lezgins is unclear. At 
present these people, who live in Southern Dagestan and in the 
north of Azerbaijan, are divided by the Russian-Azeri border. 
Are half a million people to expect repetition of a kind of 
"Berlin Wall," albeit of a less severe form? 
  When he arrived in Azerbaijan in January, Colonel General 
Andrey Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of the RF Border Troops, 
tried to persuade President Aliyev to give his consent to 
locating Russian Border Troops along the Azeri-Iranian border 
and in the 11-kilometer section of the Turkish border in the 
Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. By returning to positions they 
occupied long ago, they could dependably protect the southern 
borders of Azerbaijan, and restrain the onslaught of smugglers 
and messengers of the international drug mafia, who have 
transformed Azerbaijan into a transloading point en route to 
Russia and back. However, Nikolayev's mission failed, and the 
consent was not obtained. 
  Lieutenant General Aleksandr Bespalov, deputy 
commander-in-chief of the Border Troops, met with leaders of the 
Lezgin National Council in Derbent. LNC Chairman Nariman 
Ramazanov told this OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent about this 
meeting. Because Azerbaijan joined the CIS, the Lezgins were 
certain that the danger of their becoming a people divided in 
half by a border was past. But now the position of the border 
guards is such, the LNC chairman said, that they will apparently 
close the border soon, because its "transparency" was doing 
significant damage to Russian interests. "This in turn will 
divide the Lezgin people for all time: The governments of 
Azerbaijan and Russia are attempting to solve the problem 
without our participation," said Nariman Ramazanov. He is 
frightened by the growing separatist sentiments among the 
Lezgins. Kakhrimanov, who served as chairman of the LNC before 
Ramazanov, and his supporters are appealing to their people to 
take up arms and fight for establishment of an independent state 
of Lezgistan, which would include land to the north and south of 
the Samur River. Formerly the chief of the political directorate 
of the Northern Caucasian Military District, Kakhrimanov enjoys 
significant authority among his fellow countrymen. It became 
known to this OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent from one of these 
close associates of the retired general that large amounts of 
weapons were concentrated in regions adjacent to the 
Russian-Azeri border. If a compromise is not reached shortly in 
the matter of the Russian-Azeri border and the status of the 
region's Lezgin population, these weapons may begin to speak.

<F P=106> [Abridged account of a report by K. Zatulin: "At the Gate </F>
Without a Fence"] 
  [Text] The lower house of the Russian Parliament 
yesterday passed in its first reading the draft federal law "On 
the Status of a Deputy of the Federation Council of the First 
Convocation and the Status of a Deputy of the State Duma of the 
First Convocation of the Federal Assembly of the Russian 
Federation." 
  Information had been presented prior to this the day 
before on parliamentary hearings in the CIS Committee on 
Russian-Georgian relations. A report was delivered by Deputy K. 
Zatulin, chairman of the committee. We publish his speech in 
abridged form. 
  You all know that Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, president of 
the Russian Federation, paid an official visit on 3 February to 
the Republic of Georgia. And that the result of this visit was 
the signing of Friendship, Good-Neighbor, and Cooperation Treaty 
with the Republic of Georgia and a whole list of joint 
Russian-Georgian documents. 
  While welcoming, on the whole, the development of 
Russian-Georgian relations and the rapprochement between recent 
Union republics of the USSR, we have to mention that the treaty 
between Russia and Georgia signed on 3 February does not 
entirely correspond to the high standards required of so 
important a document both in terms of content and, which is far 
more serious, in terms of the consequences of the signing. 
  Certain articles of the treaty, primarily Articles 3 and 4, 
would, in the event of its ratification, signify Russia's 
unilateral commitments to arm the Georgian side, support its 
attempts by all means to secure its control over what are, in 
fact, lost areas, and cut short attempts to assist them from the 
territory of Russia in the event of an escalation of the 
military conflict. We cannot fail to note that in assuming 
commitments to Georgia in the Caucasus, which will be hard to 
fulfill even for Russia, we are losing the trust of other 
parties to the conflict and damaging our own mediating, 
peace-making mission. It seems to us that Russian diplomacy 
should be aspiring to a lowering of the level of military 
opposition, disarmament, and the imposition of an embargo on 
supplies of arms to the explosive region. Under conditions where 
Georgia, on the Georgian side's representatives' own admission 
at the hearings, suffered a devastating military defeat and the 
armed forces of Georgia number approximately 1,500 men 
constantly warring among themselves, we deny the capacity of the 
Georgian side for guaranteeing strict compliance with the 
provisions of the treaty on the nontransfer of arms, military 
equipment, and technology to third parties. 
  The members of the committee support the verbal statement of 
President of the Russian Federation Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin 
on deferral of submittal for ratification by the Federal 
Assembly of the treaty signed on 3 February until there has been 
a settlement of the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. But 
we simply cannot understand why prior to the commitment of 
Russian demarcation troops on the line of opposition along the 
Inguri River and prior to the submittal for ratification of the 
previous treaty between Russia and Georgia, which was signed in 
Moscow on 9 October 1993, Russia, in the person of its highest 
official, is signing a new treaty, which the president himself 
does not contemplate submitting for ratification. This treaty 
not only offends against the self-esteem of Georgia--the 
postponement of ratification--but is also causing rumblings 
among the mass of Russian citizens living in the North 
Caucasus.... I would like to say that the reason for our 
disquiet is not only the treaty and not so much the fact of the 
signing of a whole number of additional agreements as the fact 
that, having analyzed the text of these agreements, we have 
concluded that we are being put into the position of people who 
are guarding a gate where there is no fence. 
  A whole number of the agreements signed on 3 February, and 
there are many useful and necessary agreements among them, makes 
no provision for any ratification procedure. For example, the 
agreement on border troops, Article 33, contains, instead of a 
direct, unambiguous indication of the need for ratification, a 
quite evasive provision to the effect that this agreement will 
take effect on the day of the exchange of notification in 
writing of the parties' compliance with the intrastate 
procedures necessary for this agreement to take effect. 
  What this might signify I could explain in the example of 
the 
question of the location of military bases in the Republic of 
Georgia. We are talking about bases in Akhalkalak, in Aziani, 
and in Batumi, and the last base offers subsidiaries in Sukhumi 
and Gudauty, what is more. The Abkhaz side and the Supreme 
Council of Abkhazia have already declared that they will not 
permit and will not recognize any accords without their 
participation in respect to territory which they consider Abkhaz 
and which they control. We get the impression that the Georgian 
side is involving Russia's Armed Forces in the complex relations 
with the Abkhaz. 
  Summing up the question of the analysis of the treaty and 
the 
accords as a whole, I would like to mention the speculation to 
the effect that this treaty is one-sidedly to the benefit of 
Russia.... I would like to call attention to the fact that 
Russia's economic assistance to Georgia, signifying an increase 
in the intrastate debt, cannot be valued in absolute figures as 
yet, because we know neither the value of the property which 
will be transferred nor the cost of the lease of the military 
bases nor the cost of the arms with which we subsequently 
contemplate furnishing the Georgian Army and arming and 
equipping the Georgian Army [as published]. 
  As far as the realization of the military cooperation 
agreements is concerned--as a result of these agreements there 
will be a reduction in the military presence of 
Russian troops in Georgia, despite all the obfuscation on the 
part of certain analysts and representatives of the news media. 
The replacement of the division in Akhalkalak and Batumi by 
regiments cannot be called an increase in the military presence. 
  And, finally, the last point I would like to make in this 
connection: A military-strategic and political alliance with 
Georgia, which the committee supports in principle, is possible 
only on the basis of a solution of internal problems on the 
territory of the former Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic as a 
result of our guarantee not only to the Government of Georgia 
but to Abkhazia and South Ossetia also.

<F P=106> [Interview with President of Ukraine L.M. Kravchuk by </F>
UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Editor in Chief Valeriy Zholdak, in the office 
of the president of Ukraine on 9 December 1993; published under 
the rubric "UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Projects: Realistic Contenders for 
the Office of President of Ukraine, Elections to Which Have Been 
Scheduled for 26 June 1994": "`Ukraine Will Be Great and 
Strong.' UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Editor in Chief Has a Conversation 
With President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk About the Most Burning 
Problems in Domestic and Foreign Policy of Ukraine, the Leading 
Cadres of the State, the Family, Rumors, and the Woes of the 
People"--for first two installments see Ukrainian National

  [Text] 
<H5>  Will There Be Communism in a Separate Oblast? </H5>
  [Zholdak] ...So, who is tearing our state apart? 
  [Kravchuk] Let us determine first what separatism is. 
Transcarpathia, the Crimea, and Odessa cannot be accused all 
together; I am against this. This is ignorance! Believe me, it 
is ignorance! 
  [Zholdak] Why? 
  [Kravchuk] When, let us say, a region wants to have the 
right 
to invest, wants to have more economic rights in order to use 
its internal reserves which are specific to this region, 
undertakes to pay taxes, and does not raise issues concerning a 
change in its status, this is not separatism. If the point at 
issue is taking advantage of economic opportunities, it is not 
separatism; this is normal. There are two paths to choose: 
Either the state assumes responsibility for everything and says: 
I will provide for you, I will help you, and you will work in 
peace; if the state is not able to do so, it says: You take 
advantage of your own opportunities yourselves, work, and 
provide everything necessary for yourselves; pay your taxes 
yourselves. Tell me please what kind of separatism is this 
anyway? 
  [Zholdak] Is it not separatism if they refuse to execute the 
laws of Ukraine and your edicts? 
  [Kravchuk] Who is refusing? 
  [Zholdak] There are such people. We will be publishing items 
about this, in particular, an article by an adviser to the 
representative of the president, your representative in Odessa 
Oblast, one might say, your eyes and ears. 
  [Kravchuk] However, you will find cases in which edicts of 
the president and laws of the Supreme Council are not complied 
with not only in Odessa Oblast but in all oblasts of Ukraine. 
This is a complicated time. 
  [Zholdak] Correct. 
  [Kravchuk] For your part, you wish to apply a certain 
formula 
of separatism to individual regions. 
  [Zholdak] However, we cannot remain silent. The Crimea also 
started out with this until it came to the presidency, to being 
a state. 
  [Kravchuk] This is not terrible, either. We interpret the 
presidency in the Crimea as a form of local executive power. 
  [Zholdak] It is terrible. 
  [Kravchuk] I am explaining to you that it is not. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, pardon me, but is it a normal 
phenomenon to see that your representative and the head of an 
oblast council cannot find a common language--one pulls one way, 
and the other the other way. I mentioned this abnormality to 
Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch. He said that such dual power is a bad 
phenomenon. 
  [Kravchuk] It is bad. 
  [Zholdak] One person should lead and be personally 
responsible for everything. 
  [Kravchuk] This is precisely what we set forth in the draft 
of the new Constitution. We know, and it is our mentality, that 
if, say, two angels are ensconced and each has his power, they 
will begin to fight after a while. 
  [Zholdak] Correct. 
  [Kravchuk] This is why for our mentality, for our society, 
the determining factor is for power to be held in the same hands. 
  [Zholdak] So, what did you write in the draft Constitution? 
  [Kravchuk] The head of power is elected by the people 
locally. That is it! One individual resolves all issues.... 
Well, not one individual personally.... Incidentally, the 
Supreme Council passed a law on this issue. 
  [Zholdak] Correct, correct! Everything should come under 
this 
person; there will be order then, and there will be someone to 
be held accountable. 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, and there will not be the tug-of-war that 
you 
mentioned. 
  [Zholdak] Will this head of, say, the oblast be subordinated 
to the president or, once again, to the Supreme Council? The 
Supreme Council is a legislative organ; it should not be the 
leading and guiding force of society. 
  [Kravchuk] This will now be a mechanism set forth in the 
law. 
The law will set forth everything: how the chairman is elected, 
what powers he has, and what obligations he has to the 
president, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Supreme Council. It 
cannot be that I say so and you do it. This is a dangerous 
thing: I have said so! If this word comes to your mind, and you 
begin saying once again: "I have said--ban it!", "I have 
said--do not go!", it will be no good. The entire state power 
should be built on the law. 
  [Zholdak] This is clear. Leonid Makarovych, you "omitted" my 
previous question.... So, what do you think: Mr. Bodelan and 
other oblast leaders, former Communist figures, for example in 
Donetsk--are they acting properly in demanding that free 
economic zones be legalized? 
  [Kravchuk] This is a normal phenomenon. Free economic zones 
should be "within the law." 
  [Zholdak] Is this not urging by some kind of forces to 
secede 
within, and subsequently without? Such as, for example, the 
Hungarians urging Transcarpathia.... 
  [Kravchuk] What is a free economic zone and its status? It 
is 
a so-called "point" zone, an administrative zone. All this 
already exists in the world, and nobody is scared of it. We have 
not suddenly chosen or discovered this.... 
  [Zholdak] However, they also want their own borders and to 
establish their own customs. Do you understand? 
  [Kravchuk] Listen, if it is a free economic zone, it has its 
own laws of life. 
  [Zholdak] All these laws of "their own" should not 
counteract 
those of the state. 
  [Kravchuk] Specifics are at work here. If, say, you cut 
through a free economic zone, you plug yourself into a different 
system of economic relations. You cannot go there with your own 
"statute." You should meet the conditions of the zone. For 
example, I have been to these zones in China, where the 
situation is similar. 
  [Zholdak] Is each zone over there a "monastery" with its own 
statute? 
  [Kravchuk] Yes. 
  [Zholdak] So, is there one set of requirements when you 
enter 
one zone, and another one when you enter another? 
  [Kravchuk] Of course. Other laws are in effect. 
  [Zholdak] But is the state one? 
  [Kravchuk] It is economic laws that are in effect, not 
political! The state does not mean the economy. The state means 
the system. Within the state there may be special situations in 
various regions. I am saying that this should not be feared. 
<H5>  This Is Something Alien in Our State </H5>
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, do you know what people are now 
afraid of? Of the "democrats" who have run Ukraine into the 
ground. Who are such democrats at present? I mean democrats who 
are in power. You, Mr. President, one of the former leaders of 
the Communists of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Mr. 
Chairman of the Supreme Council--likewise a former member of the 
party nomenklatura. A majority of local leaders are from the 
glorious host of Lenin.... 
  [Kravchuk] You know, we live in a world of cliches. Are 
there 
many people who are capable of governing in a new way? They 
tried, they thought it was easy, that devotion alone would 
suffice.... 
  [Zholdak] I am telling you about real facts. 
  [Kravchuk] I am also telling you about real facts. For 
example, they elected the Supreme Council. It immediately split 
into two groups--the democrats and the partocrats. Instead of 
proceeding to cooperate, they began to battle each other. Some 
condemned others, others abused the party, the leaders, and so 
on. What did it bring about? What did the People's Council begin 
with in the Supreme Council? They did not vote. Correct? How 
have they ended now? They will not vote again. Then Ihor 
Rafayilovych spoke and stated: "We refuse to vote." Four years 
have gone by. Now, Mr. Zayets speaks, and also states: "We 
refuse to vote." All of us have built our lives on struggle, on 
confrontation. I have proclaimed constantly: Do not look for 
enemies within the country. If you look for them, you will find 
them and embroil everybody, embroil Ukraine, and divide Ukraine 
into east and west, and there will be an eternal struggle. I 
say: Good people, find grounds for living here. The people are 
what they are, you will not change them. Yuriy Khotlubey, the 
chairman of the Mariupol City Council, a people's deputy from 
among the partocrats whom you have mentioned, introduced a 
proposal in the Supreme Council: Set us free, set the 
enterprises free, open the way to a market economy. People 
cannot be judged on the slogans they proclaim, but should be 
judged on what they do. 
  [Zholdak] Correct. 
  [Kravchuk] If you set us free, he said, we will make money 
and sell things ourselves. This is already a market economy. 
Look, life has brought this "partocrat" (in the parlance of the 
democrats) to a market economy. Every thinking man would 
understand that continuous political struggle will not take the 
country out of an economic crisis. Everybody proclaimed: We have 
severed relations with Russia. Now they are already stating at a 
congress of entrepreneurs: The process is underway, Russia 
abandoned Ukraine, pushed Kazakhstan out of the ruble zone, and 
is pushing others out because such is the situation. Russia 
cannot do otherwise. It is protecting its own interests. We 
should not take offense at it. We should unite in work rather 
than quarrel. Meanwhile, the democrats began by drawing cards 
and not voting, and have arrived at the same.... We do not have 
an opposition because normal opposition is always constructive. 
Our so-called opposition is geared toward destruction, 
rejection, and the denunciation of "anybody and anything." This 
opposition was born for struggle rather than for creation. 
  [Zholdak] However, Leonid Makarovych, I did not bring to 
your 
attention the democrats who vote or fail to vote in the chamber 
of the Supreme Council. Who specifically rules the state, 
regions, oblasts, and rayons at present? Who rules locally? The 
former party leaders rule. They have become democrats. 
  [Kravchuk] Who has ruled in certain oblasts, say, western 
oblasts? 
  [Zholdak] Those were mere individuals. 
  [Kravchuk] No. We had 3.5 million Communists here, in 
Ukraine. All positions--from team leader to the chairman of the 
Council of Ministers--were held by members of the CPSU. Do you 
really think that things would have moved had people filled 
leadership positions who did not have any skills in management 
work? And that had we promoted someone, say, from the People's 
Council in Donetsk, all these Communists, directors, and others 
with a certain psychological party charge would have reacted to 
him properly right away? This is an illusion. Experienced cadres 
and proper conditions are needed. People change, they gradually 
begin to understand the new conditions and their 
irreversibility. They should not be viewed as enemies. So, I 
take a newspaper and read it, and all kinds of labels are pinned 
in it.... 
  [Zholdak] UKRAYINSKA HAZETA does not attach labels.... 
  [Kravchuk] No, you do not have that. Although yours is a 
trenchant newspaper, it displays a culture of respectable 
relations with the readers and those who, as you wrote, lead us 
at present. Believe me, there are publications that one hates to 
pick up. 
  [Zholdak] Do not pick them up. 
  [Kravchuk] I do not. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, to complete the "party" topic I 
would ask you, as a citizen of the new Ukrainian state and at 
the same time a former prominent party leader, to sincerely 
voice your personal thoughts about the Communist Party, its past 
and present, its credits and defeats, its crimes against the 
people (I feel, I am convinced that we are holding this 
conversion sincerely). I am not concerned with rank-and-file 
Communists. You would know better than anyone the strength and 
might of the Brezhnev and Shcherbytskyy-style party clutches in 
Ukraine. As you see it, what will be the future of what once was 
your party and mine? Many post-Communist countries have already 
condemned it, including Russia. What is your view of it? 
  [Kravchuk] Indeed, I have lived not only in the party but 
also in the leading organs. I became firmly convinced that 
communist ideology and communist ideals do not have any 
prospects. This is my profound conviction, and I will not ever 
abandon it. However, as president I cannot ban the party on the 
basis of this conviction because this would not be democratic. A 
party can exist in any country, including the Communist Party. 
It is the right of the people to choose a party for themselves. 
The situation in our country is different. At present, the 
Communist Party wants to say that it is already completely new, 
since it proclaims some, shall we say, slightly different 
slogans or updates old slogans. If 18- or 20-year-olds came to 
this party and tried to create a party for Ukrainian statehood, 
so that they could come out in favor of an independent state, of 
Ukrainian culture and language, of their preservation, I would 
support this party, regardless of my position, although I would 
not join in. When people come along and say that this is a 
different party, and at the same time accuse us of having made a 
mistake in coming out for independence, and demand that the 
Union be restored again, this is not a Communist Party of 
Ukraine. It is something alien in our state. This party comes 
out against the statehood of its country. 
  [Zholdak] Correct. 
  [Kravchuk] This is why I am against this party and this 
ideology, but not generally against the party. 
  [Zholdak] You see, Mr. President, the Ministry of Justice 
and 
its leader, Mr. Onopenko personally, have registered this party 
which had been retreaded in order to pull the wool over our eyes. 
  [Kravchuk] The people there should be the guardians of the 
law. Incidentally, Hrushevskyy and Vynnychenko also had certain 
socialist views of society, but they talked about a Communist 
Party of Ukraine, of their state, a party that defends the 
interests of its people, and not at all a party that operates in 
Ukraine but whose center is located somewhere in another foreign 
country, and which does everything against its people and its 
state. You will understand that this is impermissible. 
  [Zholdak] At present, two similar parties, the Communist and 
Socialist Parties, are uniting on this "revolutionary-Leninist 
platform." 
  [Kravchuk] They probably have a lot in common here. This is 
why I am telling them: If you are different, be so kind as to 
show by deeds and not just words that you are for an independent 
state, that you are making an effort to build, that you are 
coming out against those who would destroy statehood, who come 
out against us. Prove this, and I will support you. 
  [Zholdak] You know, Leonid Makarovych, I had a conversation 
with Stanislav Hurenko about what you are saying. I even wanted 
to interview him. We made arrangements, and I notified the 
readers about this through the newspaper. Later, he suddenly 
called me and said: "You know, I have reread the latest issues 
of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA and noticed that we have somewhat different 
positions." I said to this: So what if we have different 
positions, let us reflect on this, and the readers will draw 
conclusions for themselves as to which one is right. He refused, 
and it is a pity. Why did I want to talk to him? I liked one 
position of his. He had said before that he had prepared the 
organizational congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine in 
Donetsk after it was banned. However, he then refused to be 
elected as a member of the Central Committee, of the leading 
organs. Why? It turned out that he was against the desire of 
other leaders of the Central Committee for revanche. 
  [Kravchuk] Oh! 
  [Zholdak] The second point he made to me: A new party should 
be headed by new people, young people--what you have also said. 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, the party will be new if new and younger 
people with other views and convictions come in. 
  [Zholdak] Who is the "helmsman" of the party now? Petro 
Symonenko has grown from a Komsomol [All-Union Lenin Communist 
Youth League] boy to a secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Lenin Communist Youth League of Ukraine and secretary of the 
Donetsk Oblast Party Committee.... 
  [Kravchuk] I do not want to.... 
  [Zholdak] Let us not.... However, another newly elected 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
Ukraine, Oleksandr Kotsyuba.... 
  [Kravchuk] I do not want to discuss or characterize any one 
of them. Time and the people will do this. 
  [Zholdak] Do not say anything, Leonid Makarovych, I will say 
this. Third, for the party to again conquer the "mind" of all 
the masses it should be headed by authoritative individuals 
respected by the people. 
  [Kravchuk] Not just authoritative individuals.... An 
authoritative person may have the old mentality and the old 
ideology. 
  [Zholdak] Yes. 
  [Kravchuk] Do you know how much life and...struggle I needed 
in order to tell you these words right now: I will never go back 
to the Communist Party? Meanwhile, anybody can say that without 
fearing for his life. 
  [Zholdak] Indeed, it was very interesting and pleasant for 
me 
to hear these words from your lips, and we will publish this. 
  [Kravchuk] These are my convictions. 
  [Zholdak] I believe you. 
  [Kravchuk] However, I will never take even a step in order 
to 
ban a Communist Party that will, I repeat, operate in the 
interests of an independent Ukraine, or to forbid any person to 
join that Communist Party. At the same time, I will fight to the 
end the communist ideology or the nationalist ideology that 
threatens our state. 
<H5>  The Famine of 1933--Genocide of the Ukrainian Nation </H5>
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you often talk so persuasively 
that one believes you. Will you be able to convince me that you, 
the former leader of the ideological front of the Communist 
Party, did not know about the year 1933? On one occasion, you 
stated that you have only now learned from documents the true 
facts about the famine in Ukraine. I had not previously read the 
documents, either, but I conjectured and believed that this was 
the annihilation of our Ukraine by Stalin's communist clique. 
Did you really think otherwise? 
  [Kravchuk] I made my assessment on the basis of the facts I 
knew. 
  [Zholdak] But you did know! Say that you did. After all, you 
have stated that you did not. 
  [Kravchuk] I have stated that I did not know the real scope. 
I said this because I had not seen the documents. 
  [Zholdak] However, you knew about the fact itself, about 
this 
having been the annihilation of Ukraine, of the Ukrainian 
nation. They also exiled people from Latvia.... 
  [Kravchuk] They exiled people from my village. Why go far? 
However, knowing individual facts and seeing the entire panorama 
are different things, different values for generalization. I 
studied them, and later these documents were published when the 
Communist Party was still in power.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuri Meshkov, newly-elected president of </F>
Crimea, by Sergei Tikhy, MN correspondent in Kiev: "Balancing 
Between Kiev and Moscow..."; first paragraph is introductory 
paragraph] 
  [Text] Having emerged victorious at the presidential 
elections in the Republic of Crimea, Yuri Meshkov immediately 
entered the playing field of the far from simple relations 
between Ukraine and Russia. The newly-elected President of 
Crimea is interviewed by Sergei Tikhy, MN correspondent in Kiev. 
  MN: What, Yuri Alexandrovich, is the 
superconfidentiality which surrounded your first visits as 
President of Crimea to Kiev and Moscow linked to? 
  Yu.M.: If I were to speak about my trip to Kiev, 
the point is not about superconfidentiality, but in the concrete 
circumstances of this key meeting. A representative of the 
administration was sent to the airport, the car arrived without 
any escort. From the first moments I came to feel that my visit 
was of no special importance for Kiev, and that there was no 
special attitude towards the Republic of Crimea in comparison 
with Ukraine's other regions. I convinced myself that the 
meeting had a routine, rank-and-file character. It was a meeting 
not with the President of the Republic of Crimea, but with a 
clerk who represented some part of the administration. I had to 
behave accordingly, as was dictated by the Kiev administration: 
no press conferences and no coverage in the press -- all of this 
would have been unreasonable, even illogical. 
  And as far as the meeting in Moscow is concerned, there I 
felt like I was on native soil. The visit was businesslike and 
concrete. Natural hospitality, a natural well-wishing reception, 
and a lot of work. But in virtue of a number of circumstances I 
didn't find it possible to broadly notify anyone about these 
meetings in advance in order not to complicate things for 
persons with whom I met. 
  MN: In what way could you have compounded these 
persons' position? 
  Yu.M.: There was a warm attitude towards me and I, 
for my part, made no moves without their agreement, without 
obtaining permission for the coverage of this or that meeting in 
the press. 
  MN: Who met you in Moscow? 
  Yu.M.: You are again leading me to specifics about 
who participated in the meetings. 
  MN: Why, after your visit to Kiev where, as you have 
said, you were received as a clerk, the press service of the 
President of Ukraine circulated an official communique on the 
visit which had been agreed upon with you, whereas in Moscow, 
where you were accorded a welcome befitting a president, even 
the information on who met you was classified? Incidentally, 
were you accompanied in Moscow by the officials of the State 
Traffic Inspectorate? 
  Yu.M.: In Moscow there was everything 
indispensable for a meeting at such a level. 
  MN: Nevertheless, judging by press reports, you were 
satisfied with the results of the Kiev meeting? 
  Yu.M.: Indeed, the discussion was normal, 
concerning economic problems. I don't want to say that the 
meeting was patently hostile in character or that attempts to 
injure someone's pride were made during the course of it. 
  MN: The Supreme Soviet has adopted amendments to the 
constitution in accordance with which the President of Ukraine 
has the right to cancel the decisions of local authorities, 
including your own. Do you anticipate clashes with Kiev on this 
question in the immediate future? 
  Yu.M.: The adopted decision contradicts the 
Constitution of Ukraine. The structure of the executive branch 
has no right to decide questions on whether the statutory acts 
being adopted by local authorities are consistent with the 
Constitution. This is a prerogative of the Constitutional Court 
of Ukraine. 
  MN: In other words, the decision of Ukraine's Supreme 
Soviet is not legitimate, right? 
  Yu.M.: It is not legitimate in this given case. 
Let's put it this way: it is a disputed issue. 
  MN: And what about the invitation to Mr. Saburov to 
occupy the post of Crimea's head of government? Insofar as 
Saburov has no Ukrainian citizenship, this flies in the face of 
Ukraine's Constitution. 
  Yu.M.: The question is about deciding economic 
matters. And if we begin pulling out commas and try to formalize 
the procedure of appointment with commas, I will put so many 
squiggles on the Kiev administration's table that they will be 
sorting them out until the end of the year. Whatever has been 
promised to the citizens of the Republic of Crimea will be 
carried out. I have no other obligations to anyone. My 
programme, for which the citizens voted, will be carried out 
with the help of the most highly competent specialists. 
  MN: In other words, for the sake of fulfilling these 
tasks you may violate the Ukrainian Constitution? 
  Yu.M.: This does not amount to a violation of the 
Constitution of Ukraine. Such matters are decided by the 
President of the Republic of Crimea. 
  MN: Under what conditions would the question of 
Crimea's secession from Ukraine not be raised at all? 
  Yu.M.: But it has not been raised. The question is 
about establishing normal civilized relations on the basis of a 
treaty, as it is written down in the Constitution of the 
Republic of Crimea. 
  MN: During the election campaign an adventurous, 
putting it mildly, situation took shape in Crimea: pursuits, 
assassination attempts, shootouts. It was even rumoured that 
before the second round you left one of the apartments along the 
fire escape. Is this true? 
  Yu.M.: I was guarded by the Scorpio group. The 
boys volunteered and guaranteed me the highest level of security. 
  MN: And what about the fire escape? 
  Yu.M.: If I go into detail, this will take a lot 
of time. The investigation is not yet over and many 
circumstances are still being studied. 
  MN: Yuri Alexandrovich, your colleagues both here, in 
Simferopol, and those in Kiev and Moscow have noted one feature 
of yours: you give no names, no figures and no facts in general. 
Is this your fundamental guidepost? 
  Yu.M.: If these remarks are essential, I will 
surely listen to them and adjust my line of behaviour. The mass 
media point to my weak, vulnerable sides, and I am grateful to 
them for this. 
  MN: With what forces in Russia would you not cooperate 
under any circumstances? 
  Yu.M.: With those people who preach views not 
permitting a normal person to shake hands with them. 
  MN File: Yuri Alexandrovich Meshkov was born 
in 1945 in Sinelnikovo, Dnepropetrovsk Region. Graduated from 
Moscow University's Department of Law and worked as an 
investigator at the Simferopol District Procurator's Office, a 
post which he had to quit over a conflict with superiors. Worked 
for three years on the merchant fleet. In 1990 was elected 
deputy to the Crimean Regional Soviet (subsequently, the Supreme 
Soviet of the Republic of Crimea). Worked as a lawyer. In 1991 
the leadership of Crimea's Bar turned to the leadership of the 
Regional Soviet with a request to dismiss lawyer Meshkov for 
numerous violations and complaints from the clientele. In August 
1991 Yuri Meshkov was among the few Crimean politicians who 
denounced the coup leaders. In January 1994 was elected 
President of the Republic of Crimea. Is married and has two 
children.

"Appeal of the People's Council"] 
  [Text] People of Ukraine! 
  The powers of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of the 12th 
term 
are coming to an end early. Its deputies were elected in the 
spring elections of 1990. These elections were a powerful 
impulse which awoke the disappointed and indifferent people and 
evoked their natural inclination for freedom, democracy, and 
justice. Everyone wanted changes in society because they 
understood well that they could go on living lies and deceit no 
longer. People went to polling stations with these thoughts. 
There were a few names on the ballots, and for the first time in 
the 70 years of Soviet power the voters got an opportunity to 
choose and thus influence the development of their country. 
  The voters attached hopes for changes in society and for a 
better future for Ukraine primarily on the Supreme Council. 
Unfortunately, under the conditions of Communist Party diktat 
and the muffling of even the smallest manifestations of 
democracy, it was extremely difficult for the patriots of 
Ukraine-democrats to become deputies. For this reason, 
representatives of the Communist Party nomenklatura--secretaries 
of oblast, city, and rayon committees, executive functionaries 
of state organs, military commanders, kolkhoz chairmen, and "Red 
directors"--gained a majority in the Supreme Council. Under the 
leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
Ukraine, they got together in the notorious "Group of 239" and 
dictated their will to the Supreme Council and all of Ukraine. 
In turn, on 6 June 1990 the democratic minority formed an 
official opposition in the parliament of Ukraine--the People's 
Council. It consisted of fewer than one-third of the total 
number of deputies; however, it was precisely due to its 
vigorous activities that we succeeded in ensuring live radio 
broadcasts and TV coverage of all meetings of the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine, which for the first time gave people of 
Ukraine an opportunity to see and hear the free, truthful word 
and alternative political views. It was precisely due to this 
information that the people of the entire Ukraine were awakened. 
What quite recently had appeared to many to be the unshaken and 
mighty Communist Party machinery in the center and localities 
began to yield one position after another. 
  From the first days of its activities, the People's Council 
has stated unequivocally that it would fight for the acquisition 
of complete political and economic independence for Ukraine. The 
Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, the Law on the 
Economic Independence of Ukraine, the Decree on Military Service 
by Citizens of Ukraine in the Territory of the Republic, the 
Decree on the Introduction of Ukrainian Time in the Territory of 
Ukraine, and the Supreme Council's confirmation of historical 
national sacred notions of Ukraine--the blue-and-yellow flag, 
the trident coat of arms, and the anthem "Ukraine Has Not 
Perished Yet"--as state symbols became the greatest achievements 
of the People's Council. Of course, the Act of Proclamation of 
the Independence of Ukraine, dated 24 August 1991, which was 
ratified by the people at a referendum on 1 December 1991, was 
the foremost accomplishment of the People's Council. This was a 
truly triumphant victory. There has been no case in history in 
any country in which the opposition, in the minority, won a 
victory in the parliament. We won it in a peaceful manner 
because we drew on support from the entire nation. However, this 
victory did not come out of nowhere--it was based on the great 
self-sacrificing labor and self-denying struggle of past 
generations for the freedom of Ukraine. We are proud of being 
directly involved in this sharp historical turn in the fate of 
our people. 
  Despite considerable obstacles, we have taken resolute steps 
along the path toward freedom and democracy. Unfortunately, we 
do not have justice yet because we have not had the opportunity 
to qualitatively change the authorities in Ukraine, beginning 
with the Supreme Council and down to the rural councils. 
Economic reforms cannot be implemented by the forces of the old 
apparatchiks. These reforms should be preceded by radical 
political changes, primarily in all branches of state power. 
Their implementation may only be ensured by the people in new 
elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine and the local organs 
of state government and self-government. 
  The People's Council sets for itself three main tasks: 
  FIRST. Acquisition of state independence by Ukraine. 
  SECOND. Removal of the Communist Party from power and the 
creation of a democratic society. 
  THIRD. Creation of an efficient market economy. 
  The first two tasks have been accomplished in the main. The 
third task is much harder to accomplish. It is precisely a 
market economy that should ensure an increase in production and 
welfare worthy of the people. Unfortunately, the life of the 
people has become harder. The reasons for this are many. First, 
the party-nomenklatura majority in the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine has continuously blocked the adoption of economic laws 
which would reform the socialist economy, make it multisectoral, 
and introduce the free development and greater pace of 
production in urban and rural areas on the principle of equal 
rights for various forms of ownership. Second, it so happens 
that the old nomenklatura, retaining command posts in the 
economy, has disposed of state property as if it were theirs, 
has plundered Ukraine, and has profiteered from the wretched 
condition of the people. Third, a situation has developed in 
which the monopoly of state property prevails in Ukraine while a 
strong executive authority is absent. This has brought about an 
unprecedented rampage of organized crime and corruption, which 
has primarily affected the power structure. Corruption and 
organized crime, which have brought about the plundering of the 
national wealth, pose the main threat to Ukraine and its 
independence. 
  The democrats are not to blame for the massive rampage of 
the 
mafia, the decline in the standard of living of the bulk of the 
population, the slump in production, and other adversity. After 
all, the democrats are not the ones to control the economy and 
make the policy of the state because there are very few of them 
in the Supreme Council; there are almost none in the Cabinet of 
Ministers, and they have not been heard from in a majority of 
oblasts, rayons, and cities. From the Supreme Council, the 
administration of the president, and the Cabinet of Ministers to 
the rural councils--everywhere, with minor exceptions, the same 
people who governed 10 or 20 years ago are still governing. 
Thus, the assertion that power in Ukraine is in the hands of the 
democrats is not true. It is exactly the other way around. The 
widespread myth that the democrats are to blame for everything 
has been created by that same party nomenklatura which remains 
in power, takes advantage of power for personal enrichment, and 
behaves in keeping with the logic of a robber who has himself 
stolen but is the first one to yell "Stop, thief!" at the 
marketplace. 
  Therefore, the removal of yesterday's people from power is 
the main task in Ukraine. We should begin with the Supreme 
Council, the new composition of which is to be elected soon. 
People should be elected as deputies on account of their 
political positions, activities in building the state, 
dedication to the principles and ideals of an independent 
Ukraine--individuals who were together with the people in this 
struggle, those who advocated and still advocate free, 
democratic development, welfare, and an affluent life for the 
people. What the Supreme Council will be tomorrow depends on who 
the people elect now--such will be the laws the Supreme Council 
will adopt and the government that will lead Ukraine. Therefore, 
look carefully at who and which forces support a candidate and 
what political platform he subscribes to. Do not make the wrong 
choice, because a mistake will cost both you and Ukraine dearly. 
Think well and remember the wise expression: "Each nation has 
the rulers it deserves." So, do everything to ensure that the 
deputies elected by you will care first of all for the people 
and for Ukraine. Remember that in the preelection struggle two 
main forces will clash first of all: those that are in favor of 
Ukrainian statehood, those that rely on the will and strength of 
their own people and want to live as masters of their native 
land and transform Ukraine into a strong and rich country, and 
those who are against Ukrainian statehood, for whom the people 
of Ukraine are merely a source for their personal enrichment. 
  Being a member of the Ukrainian parliament is a lofty and 
honorable position. However, it is necessary to view it is a 
means to serve the Motherland, which provides an opportunity to 
be of greater use and do more good for your people, rather than 
as an end in and of itself. 
  People should not come to power who are burdened by the sins 
of the past or the thirst for profits, but rather highly 
educated people with great integrity, wise and patriotically 
minded politicians for whom concern for the Motherland and the 
people constitutes the main goal. 
  The people are the only source of power. Your fate and the 
future of Ukraine are in your hands, citizens!

"Nova Khvylya on the March. Will It Be Better Than the Old?"] 
  [Text] The non-party bloc Nova Khvylya [New Wave] consists 
of people who are well known in the Lvov area and Ukraine 
generally: present people's deputies I. Yukhnovskyy, M. Kosiv, 
I. Hryniv, V. Pynzenyk, and T. Stetskiv, also I. Koliushko, L. 
Zakharchyshyn, O. Kryvenko, Yu. Kolotiy, O. Pavlenko, Z. Hladun, 
and Z. Romovska. It's no wonder that the press conference the 
bloc held in Lvov caught journalists' interest. 
  Mykhaylo Kosiv explained the bloc's name this way: right now 
Lvov is represented in Parliament by the "Sixtiers," and it's 
time someone worthy replaced replaced them, promising young 
politicians, professional jurists, economists and political 
scientists. 
  It was emphasized that the New Wavers are by no means 
unanimous. Ihor Hryniv, for example, thinks the only way to 
solve the problem of late wages is to print more money, which 
the Supreme Council has to approve at the current session. 
Viktor Pynzenyk definitely disagrees, and said in his usual 
colorful manner just what steps need to be taken. First, 
eliminate that pseudo-bank, the Ukrainian National Bank. Next, 
put the head of the bank in one of the shafts where strategic 
weapons have been stored, guarded by at least one division. 
Third, fix the exchange rate of the karbovanets to the U.S. 
dollar at 50,000 to 1. Fourth, keep strictly to the rule that 
the budget is exclusively for budget-funded organizations. No 
enterprise or organization has any claim to budget funds. 
  Press conference participants also disagreed on the role of 
people's deputies role in handling problems of the regions they 
were elected from. Viktor Pynzenyk believes all local problems 
are the job of rayon and oblast deputies. A Ukraine people's 
deputy should deal exclusively with republic-level problems. 
Ihor Hryniv's view of the situation in Parliament is that 
deputies from the eastern oblasts have formed a lobby resulting 
in a strong imbalance in subsidies. 
  Regarding cooperation between Ukraine and other countries, 
V. 
Pynzenyk thinks we do not lack for ties. We have them. What we 
do need is rubles, dollars, and... wisdom. Former members of the 
CEMA and USSR want to cooperate with us, and they will. All we 
need to do is abolish the artificially high exchange rate of the 
Ukrainian 373 karbovanets and the U.S. dollar. 
  Our policy's strategic line should follow the path our 
forefathers blazed, of their Varangians to the Greeks, say M. 
Kosiv, T. Stetskiv, and O. Kryvenko. Our foreign policy and 
geographic position will serve day by day to strengthen our 
position in the Black Sea reagion. Building a terminal in Odessa 
will reduce our dependency on our northern neighbor. The recent 
treaty between Russia and Georgia is nothing but a shotgun 
wedding, hence unstable. 
  At the end of the press conference, T. Stetskiv assured 
journalists that Nova Khvylya is willing at any time to 
coordinate the bloc's lists with those of democratic parties, 
and if a Nova Khvylya candidate's rating is lower, he will 
withdraw from the campaign.

Khmelko, chief of the department of sociology at the Kiev-Mohyla 
Academy University, under the rubric "Election 94, 27 March": 
"Preelection Attitudes of the Urban Population of Ukraine: Who 
Intends To Turn Out for the Elections, Who Does Not, and Who Is 
Not Sure"] 
  [Text] The Kiev International Institute of Sociology 
and the department of sociology of the Kiev-Mohyla Academy 
University have taken a representative sample survey of the 
adult urban population of Ukraine. Here are some data reflecting 
the status of the corresponding public opinion as of the 
beginning of 1994. Some 1,677 persons aged 18 or over were 
polled by the interview method in Kiev and 102 other cities and 
urban-type settlements of all 24 oblasts of Ukraine and Crimea. 
These persons were selected by methods which ensure highly 
representative levels of data--with a relative error at the 
level of +/-3.2 percent. 
  One of the questions was as follows: "Had the election 
campaign been already completed, and the elections held today, 
would you take part?" Some 52 percent responded in the 
affirmative, 33 percent in the negative, and 15 percent had not 
made a determination. Therefore, for now almost one-half 
of the voters in the cities of Ukraine have no firm intention of 
turning out for the elections. Meanwhile, under the law 
elections are considered valid only if no fewer than one-half of 
the citizens who are entitled to vote take part in them. Thus, 
the question "Will the elections be valid?" is not rhetorical at 
present but rather genuinely problematical. For this reason, it 
is worthwhile to analyze which social attributes and views on 
contemporary problems distinguish those who intend to turn out 
for the elections, those who do not, and those who are 
hesitating. 
  The relevant analysis indicates that voters who intend to 
vote in the elections are encountered with equal frequency among 
men and women (52 percent). The proportion of such voters 
increases with age: They account for only 43 percent of voters 
aged under 30, 47 percent of voters aged between 31 and 45, as 
many as 58 percent of voters aged 46 to 60, and 62 percent of 
voters over 60. Therefore, there are almost 1.5 times fewer 
young people than elderly who are disposed to take part in the 
elections. 
  The proportion of such voters is appreciably greater among 
people with a higher education (58 percent) than among those 
with a secondary education (49 percent); it is also higher among 
managers (62 percent) and specialists (55 percent) than among 
clerical employees (48 percent) and workers (48 percent). 
Besides this, voters who intend to vote are relatively more 
numerous among believers (56 percent) than among nonbelievers 
(49 percent), and among Ukrainians (54 percent) than among 
Russians (48 percent). To be sure, there are considerably fewer 
such voters among Russian-speaking Ukrainians (50 percent) than 
among Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians (60 percent). 
  Voters who make the position of abstention dominant (who 
intend to refrain from participation in the elections) are more 
frequently encountered among women (35 percent) than among men 
(29), and among people under 35 (39 percent) than among the 
people aged 36 to 55 (31 percent) and over 55 (27 percent). 
  The proportion of potentially abstaining voters is higher 
among voters with a complete secondary education (35 percent) 
than among voters with an education below secondary (32 percent) 
or with a higher education (27 percent). It is also relatively 
higher among clerical employees (36 percent) than among managers 
(29 percent) and specialists (28 percent). Besides, such voters 
are more numerous among nonbelievers (35 percent) than among 
believers (31 percent), and among Russians (38 percent) and 
other ethnic minorities (38 percent) than among Ukrainians (30 
percent), including Russian-speaking Ukrainians (30 percent). 
  Voters who have not yet decided whether or not to turn out 
for the elections are almost 1.5 times more numerous among men 
(19 percent) than among women (13 percent); they are also more 
numerous among young people under 30 (18 percent) than among the 
elderly over 60 (12 percent). Other age brackets occupy an 
intermediate position on this score: The proportion of voters 
who are not sure comes to 16 percent among people in the 31-45 
and 46-60 age groups. 
  The degree of readiness to participate in the elections is 
also quite different among residents of various regions of 
Ukraine. The results of an analysis of the heterogeneity of 
political orientation of the electorate of Ukraine that were 
obtained in our previous research indicate the feasibility of 
characterizing the Western, Central, Southern and Eastern 
Regions separately, if we place, respectively, Transcarpathian, 
Ivano-Frankovsk, Chernovtsy, Khmelnitskiy, Ternopol, Lvov, 
Volyn, and Rovno Oblasts in the Western Region (22 percent of 
the voters of Ukraine); Zhytomir, Vinnitsa, Kirovograd, 
Cherkassy, Kiev, Chernigov, Sumy, and Poltava Oblasts and the 
city of Kiev in the Central Region (30 percent of voters); 
Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Kherson, Nikolayev, and Odessa 
Oblasts and Crimea in the Southern Region (26 percent of 
voters); and Kharkov, Donetsk, and Lugansk Oblasts in the 
Eastern Region (22 percent of voters in Ukraine). 
  An analysis of the regional breakdown of answers by 
respondents to questions concerning readiness to take part in 
the elections indicated that potential abstainers are the most 
numerous among the urban population of the Southern Region--37 
percent. They account for 32 percent of the urban population of 
the Eastern and Western Regions, and 30 percent in the Central 
Region. The Eastern Region has the greatest reserve of electoral 
activity: The proportion of voters who are not sure whether to 
turn out for the elections comes to 21 percent there. This is 
almost two times more than in the Western Region, where such 
voters account for only 11 percent. The Central and Southern 
Regions are in an intermediate position on this score: They 
have, respectively, 14 and 16 percent of such voters. 
  Voters prepared to take part in the voting are the most 
numerous among the urban population of the Western and Central 
regions--they account for 57 percent in each. Such voters 
account for less than one half of the urban population in the 
Southern and Eastern Regions--47 and 48 percent, respectively. 
  During the last elections, the percentage of voters who 
turned out to vote was not much greater (or not greater at all) 
than the percentage of respondents who responded in the 
affirmative to the question of their intentions concerning 
participation in voting. For this reason, the percentage of such 
responses registered in the Eastern and Southern Regions prompts 
us to evaluate the likelihood of the failure of the elections in 
a significant proportion of urban electoral districts in these 
regions as quite high. This is particularly the case with the 
section of the Southern Region including Kherson, Nikolayev, and 
Odessa Oblasts and the Crimea. There, the proportion of urban 
voters who intend to take part in the elections comes to only 36 
percent +/-6 percent at present, with 0.95 probability. 
  If the propensity of voters to take part in voting grows as 
the date of the elections to the Supreme Council draws nearer, 
the projection for holding the elections will be favorable. 
However, if the abstention sentiment mounts (as has been the 
case over at least the last six to eight months), the projection 
will naturally be unfavorable. 
  Which variant of the projection is probable? 
  This has to do with the fact that the propensity to take 
part 
in the elections (which depends on many factors) is also quite 
closely associated with the assessment of the general state of 
affairs in Ukraine. Among those who believe that things are 
moving in the right direction on the whole, 73 percent of voters 
intend to vote, whereas among those who believe that they are 
moving in the wrong direction, only 50 percent intend to vote. 
There are no optimistic expectations as of now. Thus, the 
unfavorable projection concerning the completeness of the 
holding of the parliamentary elections is more probable than the 
favorable one. 
  Therefore, the question arises: If elections are not validly 
held in many districts, what is the number of elected deputies 
at which the elections will be considered to have been validly 
held in Ukraine as a whole? That is to say, what is the number 
of newly elected deputies at which it is possible to consider 
that a new composition of the Supreme Council has emerged to 
which the current Supreme Council should yield its powers? 
Perhaps not at any number? For example, should it surrender its 
powers if deputies are elected in less than 50 percent of the 
districts? 
  The Law "On the Election of People's Deputies" does not 
provide an answer to this question. It regulates establishing 
the results of elections only in an individual electoral 
district. For this reason, taking into account the unfavorable 
projection with regard to holding valid elections in a 
considerable number of electoral districts, would it not be 
worthwhile for the Supreme Council to regulate the establishment 
of election results in the entirety of electoral districts of 
Ukraine as a whole ahead of time in order to prevent a situation 
in which the legitimacy of both compositions of the Supreme 
Council--the current and the newly elected--is called into doubt?

<F P=106> [Article by Serhiy Pavlenko: "The `Zombie' Effect: What </F>
About the Elections To Be Held on 27 March 1994?"] 
  [Text] From the very outset the election campaign in 
the Chernihiv region was marked by a newspaper sensation. Its 
essence is quite simple. We voters--it is explained--are no 
longer human beings, but rather zombies, resulting from a 
"psychological weapon" used by the CIA. The mass media, which 
have been taken over by this American agency, are being used in 
a hostile manner to "subdue their own people.." 
  Let's cite some quotations. "We have become the subjects of 
a 
refined and subtle experiment which is unprecedented in its 
scope," writes M. Khmelenok in NOVYNY HORODNYANSHCHYNY. "What is 
being done is a persistent attempt--lasting for almost two years 
now--to `restructure' the mode of thinking of 90 percent of our 
country's population: to turn upside down the moral principles 
and spiritual values that have been handed down from one 
generation to the next, to make black look like white and evil 
look like good. Everything bright and shining is ridiculed and 
trampled into the dirt. What is being forged here is the 
`freedom' to steal, to play clever tricks, to be degraded, 
duped, and `not to figure things out'." The author of this quite 
lengthy article, unfortunately, did not find enough space to 
cite even one argument in support of his verbose and pessimistic 
assessments. And it seems to me that he did not want to do this 
because it would have been so hard for him. Well then, it is 
certainly vain and useless to speak about finding on the staffs 
of Chernihiv's local newspapers a single editor-agent of the 
CIA. And this is something more akin to the propaganda of 
"villains, corrupt persons, extortioners and bandits, traitors 
and ignorant persons." All this is nothing more or less than the 
ideogically misguided fantasies of dreamers, whom it is quite 
easy to forgive for their nostalgic longing for the old days, 
when the lacquered Brezhnevist truth lulled people's hearts. 
Moreover, we can agree with at least one point made by M. 
Khmelenko: The ideological manipulation of the voters as if they 
were zombies is genuinely evident nowadays in the election 
campiagn. In whose interests is this being done? Let's analyze 
certain publications. 
  The state press with certain exceptions (the rayon-level 
newspapers of Meni, Bobrovytsi, Bakhmacha, and Ichni, as well as 
the oblast-level DESNYANSKA PRAVDA), in my opinion, has 
consistently worked from issue to issue against Ukrainian 
independence. This is felt particularly just prior to the 
elections. M. Tush, the first secretary of the CPU [Ukrainian 
Communist Party] Kulykivskiy Raykom and a candidate for the 
office of people's deputy, has published more than 10 articles 
and works in verse, the contents of which can be basically 
boiled down to the following: "Give my Fatherland new birth," 
and "The shining little star soars again over the Desna. The 
soul quickens with the abundant colors of spring. Shchors will 
smile upon us again, and Lenin will awake from his sleep." And 
in subsequent issues of the rayon-level newspaper he echoes the 
political songs of H. Leheyd: "How we were in the Union. We were 
harnessed togther to a single plow. We have begun to live 
independently, and we are constantly clashing." 
  The copious rayon-level press boringly sets out such 
conclusions and headlines as the following: "My hapless Ukraine" 
(NIZHYNSKYY VISNYK), "Only in a powerful Union" (PROMIN 
ZHOVTNYA), "How did we lose our life?" (NOVYNY 
HORODNYANSHCHYNY), "How we were in the Union" (POLISKA PRAVDA), 
and so on and so forth. One gets the impression that the people 
of the Chernihiv region, like soulless zombies, are having the 
following ideas pounded into their heads: How unfortunate, 
helpless, foolish, simple-minded, and inept you are! And all 
this is because of independence! It is clear that there is no 
alternative idea to this. Nor is there any reflective thought 
given as to how life in Ukraine could be made better. And so the 
following premeditated, directorial thought has been implanted 
in the voters' collective subconscious: We are such an inept 
people. Brothers, let's gather under the protection of Moscow! 
Let's vote for the candidates who have programs specially along 
those lines. 
  Of course, all this is presented as the voice of the people. 
But it has been taken directly from the written program of the 
Ukrainian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which is now on sale for 
1300 karbovantsy at any newsstand in the Chernihiv region. The 
adherents of the only "true teaching of 
Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin" view their own future only in the 
storehouse of the USSR, which will again "support 
national-liberation movements in the colonies of imperialism," 
as a result of which the world capitalist system" will not 
emerge "from its own present-day crisis, and socialist 
revolutions will occur in most of the capitalist countries." 
  The "zombie" effect has manifested itself particularly 
during 
the days when the election campaign is gathering speed. As if 
following the gesture of an orchestra conductor, LENINSKIY 
SHLYAKH, POLISKA PRAVDA, and other newspapers at the very same 
time in February published the joint statement by the leaders of 
the Ukrainian Communist Party, Socialist Party, and Peasant 
Party: P. Symonenko, O. Moroz, and S. Dovgan respectively. 
According to this statement, the blame for all of Ukraine's 
troubles falls upon Rukh and the Ukrainian Republican Party. It 
was upon their demands that the "pro-Rukh" L. Kravchuk and I. 
Plyushch appointed to the "storehouse of the oblast- and 
rayon-level structures of state administration" "functionaries 
of these political organizations to key positions of power and 
authority." 
  Having read all the above, for whom should the voter cast 
his 
or her ballot? Of course, not for the "ruling" Rukh people, 
and--I suppose--not for the communists (among the people it 
seems that there is still a virulent allergy to raykoms, party 
activists, and the like). Our degraded people--wearied by 
political statements, promises, and economic stagnation--will 
vote, first and foremost, for people of action, for people who 
can get things done. They could be called the Expeditors (with a 
capital letter) of the election district. It is already clear 
that in the Ripkinskyy Election District No 449 victory will be 
gained by A. Dron, chairman of the Ukrainian State Committee on 
Housing and Communal Affairs. There are few persons who know for 
what and how he voted during the present parliament, but three 
Polisian rayons are almost completed converted to gas. That is a 
fact--a reality. And people know about that. And, therefore, he 
is now the main newspaper hero of the three rayons in this 
election district. 
  An analogous situation has also evolved in other districts. 
As I was informed by one of the leading officials of the 
oblast-level state administration, in January the oblast 
authorities felt themselves under some unprecedented pressure 
from Kiev. They were openly offered large-scale credits, 
off-budget financing in great amounts, and even petroleum 
products. For seats in the parliament! These are not 
good-quality principles on the basis of which life can be 
improved throughout Ukraine. But it is precisely such things 
that the voters are demanding; their evaluational criteria have 
been distorted by an obvious system of propaganda.

<F P=106> ["Direct Line" question and answer session with Yevhen </F>
Kyrylovych Marchuk, chairman of Ukraine's Security Service; 
organized by Olena Hubina, Anatoliy Martsynovskyy, and 
Vladyslava Hrechana: "Do We Have Our Spies in America?"] 
  [Excerpts] 
  [Volodymyr Bodenchuk, MOLOD UKRAYINY editor in chief] Yevhen 
Kyrylovych, they say that it is better to learn from other 
peoples' mistakes than from one's own. In recent years, there 
has been much talk in the press on the tremendous changes and 
effective work of the Russian special services. The 
Dzerzhinskiy monument was demolished and an edict was issued on 
reorganizing the security service into an intelligence agency. 
We recall a case when, after Kryuchkov [former KGB chief], 
there came a person who only stayed at his post for a few days. 
Against the backdrop of these "stormy events," it seems that 
everything is too quiet in Ukraine. However, we understand that 
things cannot remain the same and some evolution and 
restructuring must be under way in Ukraine's Security 
Service.... Please tell us about this. 
  [Marchuk] The thing is that in Ukraine, at the very 
beginning, the Security Service underwent something that has not 
been done in Russia. It is only now, after Yeltsin disbanded 
the Security Ministry, that they used the method for forming the 
service as had been employed in Ukraine. Ukraine's Supreme 
Council created a special commission for forming the Security 
Service and Counterintelligence. This commission is represented 
by the entire range of political forces. The commission, 
together with specialists, elaborated the structure of the 
Security Service, its functions, and the numerical strength. 
Then all of my deputies and other leaders (the head of the 
service was approved by the Supreme Council itself) had to pass 
through the scrutiny of the commission. Their files, past work 
in the KGB, and personal qualities were studied there. As a 
result, about one-third of the candidates did not pass the 
scrutiny. A strictly democratic principle was applied here in 
full. In Russia, it was not used. Everything has remained the 
same and only the name has changed. 
  The mechanism of control over the Security Service in 
Ukraine 
also differs from that in Russia. I reported several times at 
closed sessions of the aforementioned Supreme Council commission 
and at a closed meeting, which considered the questions of 
national security at the Supreme Council proper. There is 
control on the part of the Procurator's Office and presidential 
structures. In addition to that, at least once a week, the 
president himself meets with the head of the Security Service. 
Also, in accordance with the law, a written report on the work 
of the Security Service is submitted, once a year, to the 
Supreme Council and to the president. 
  Unlike in Russia, some subdivisions and rayon departments of 
the Security service have been reduced in numerical strength. 
The priorities, trends, and ideology of the Intelligence 
Service have completely changed. The Administration for the 
Protection of National Statehood and Territorial Integrity, even 
though it retains between 15 and 20 officers from among those, 
who used to work for the old 5th, or Ideological Directorate, 
but 120 others, who were there in the past, are no longer 
employed. At present, the formation of this directorate 
proceeds through trials and tribulations. However, certain 
principles of counterintelligence have remained unchanged. 
Because intelligence services of other states continue working 
in Ukraine as before and, in some directions, even more 
thoroughly and in greater depth.... Still, I cannot say that 
they resort to methods of sabotage -- we do not have any such 
information. 
  [Bodenchuk] If this is not a secret, could you tell us how 
the numerical strength of the Security Service has changed? 
  [Marchuk] As a matter of fact, Ukraine did not have its own 
Security Service. We did not have an independent 
infrastructure, such as exist in Romania, Poland, or the United 
States. Many components of this structure were stationed in 
Moscow. We had to create something here. The only thing that I 
will tell you is that the quantity of operational subdivisions 
and operational officers has not increased. However, we have 
incorporated those subdivisions that were recently referred to 
as "special departments" -- the military counterintelligence. 
We are presently restructuring them. 
  The former ideological department has no "consumer," and, 
therefore, the structure itself no longer exists. Instead, 
there emerge structures, which we did not have before. For 
example, governmental communications. In Ukraine, there were 
several regiments servicing governmental communications, but 
they were directly subordinated to Moscow. However, in the 
past, they were maintained for one purpose and now -- for a 
different one. For example, here in Ukraine, we have places 
where there is no high- frequency communication, especially in 
the eastern region. There were a few cases when some tragedy 
happened, such as an accident in a mine, and there was no 
reliable communication. 
  Take also the classified communications for the state 
leadership in the case of extraordinary events. This is what 
these forces are for. 
  [Passage omitted on Marchuk's religious convictions and 
moral 
principles]. 
  [LIBERALNA HAZETA columnist Heorhiy Bursov] We know from the 
press about the case when an officer of Ukraine's Security 
Service went to Poland on a private visit and was arrested, 
because the Polish side had not been notified on the trip and 
found it harmful. Caring about Ukraine's security, does 
Ukraine's Security Service detain Russian Security Service 
officers when they cross the Ukrainian "transparent" borders? 
Also when they arrive to the Crimea on private business. 
  [Marchuk] You referred to Major Lysenko from Lvov Oblast who 
was arrested in Poland. Court proceedings are now in progress, 
although they were postponed several times. From the very 
beginning, we officially informed the Polish side and the 
leadership of Polish special services, through the channels of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Embassy, and the state 
leadership, that this is nothing but a provocation on the part 
of some political forces in Poland that managed to put pressure 
upon the special services to arrest our officer. My adviser for 
legal issues, General Prystayko, is presently in Poland. 
Together with representatives of the Embassy, he is doing 
everything to settle the conflict [Lysenko has meanwhile been 
deported to Ukraine, see ld0803235694 Kiev Radio Ukraine World 
Service Ukrainian 0803190094 -- Official Calls Polish Sentence 
of `Spy' Provocation]. 
  As regards officers of the [Russian] Federal 
Counterintelligence Service.... You mean them? 
  [Bursov] Yes. 
  [Marchuk] The thing is that, when we are informed that 
somebody is arriving on private business or to visit parents 
(the Federal Service of Russian Counterintelligence employs many 
people of Ukrainian descent) and when this procedure is 
coordinated, there are no problems. However, with regard to 
strictly official matters, we have an agreement with the Russian 
special service. In those cases when there is mutual interest, 
we go to them and they come to us. Incidentally, a group from 
the Russian Counterintelligence Service is presently in Kiev, 
and we are jointly planning a complicated operation. We did not 
have to deal with cases of anybody from the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence engaging in some secret subversive activity 
here. 
  [Bursov] However, one can expect that there may be such 
attempts precisely on the part of Russia -- we know about its 
internal political situation. 
  [Marchuk] There exist such principles in the cooperation 
with special services of other countries: Trust, but check. In 
other words, no matter with whom we cooperate, we have our own 
interests, national priorities, and priority interests of 
special services. That is why corresponding preventive measures 
are taken to foil activities of foreign special services on the 
territory of Ukraine. 
  [Bursov] Spies are being caught everywhere in the world, but 
we did not hear about your boys catching somebody. Or maybe 
such things are hushed up? 
  [Marchuk] We recently gave the mass media information to the 
effect that two persons, who had engaged in espionage on the 
territory of Ukraine, were not only arrested, but also 
sentenced. One of them is a person without citizenship and the 
other -- a Ukrainian citizen. We also revealed 11 persons, who 
passed intelligence information to foreign states. However, as 
they say, it is a tactical, technical, and legal matter -- how 
to conclude this whole case. 
  [Bursov] At least, there were no corresponding notes from 
Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to governments of foreign 
countries. 
  [Marchuk] It is sometimes more advantageous not to issue 
notes, but to keep the situation under control. 
  [Bursov] I understand you: In order not to scare off bigger 
game? I thank you! 
  [Passage omitted on alleged corruption at a local factory, 
lack of discipline, alleged surveillance of stamp collector, 
violations in the election campaign, national symbols, problems 
of housing for security officers] 
  [Roman Volodymyrovych Lebedyn from Kiev] Tell me, please, 
whether there are Ukrainian spies in the United States. 
  [Marchuk] Not a single security service will say anything 
about this. We have what the state needs. Perhaps, not as much 
as necessary and not everywhere. 
  [Lebedyn] There should be more? Just express your opinion: 
Do we need more? 
  [Marchuk] If I had been a private person and answered your 
question, it would have been one matter. However, if I, as an 
official, say this publicly, tomorrow, there will already be a 
note from the U.S. Government, especially on the eve of the 
president's trip to the United States.... There are Russian 
spies there. There have recently been reports in the press 
about such a spy uncovered by the CIA. 
  [Lebedyn] What do you do in order to prevent the uncovering 
of Ukrainian spies? 
  [Marchuk] If they haven't been uncovered then they haven't 
been uncovered. I am joking. However, seriously speaking, this 
is a quite specific matter, which cannot be discussed in public. 
  [Lebedyn] One more thing. We want to elect honest and 
decent people as deputies. What X-rays do you have to check 
this? 
  [Marchuk] Fortunately, the Security Service is not the kind 
of institution that provides reports on whether a candidate for 
deputy is honest or not. This is up to the voters to decide. 
  [Lebedyn] However, when you employ people, you check them, 
don't you? 
  [Marchuk] We are authorized to do so by the law. Those 
people who come to us, consciously and voluntarily agree to 
certain restrictions of their rights. For example, they cannot 
engage in commercial activity and some other things. 
  [Lebedyn] In the United States, they have a lie detector. 
Do we also have it? 
  [Marchuk] The lie detector is not the main thing. The 
person must have scruples. No detector can sense a 
transformation in somebody's personality over time. 
  [Passage omitted on combating economic crime] 
  [Yuriy Kreminskyy, engineer from Kiev] There are 
increasingly frequent reports in the press about anti-Ukrainian 
actions in the Crimea. A procession was organized in Simferopol 
with a coffin bearing an inscription "Independent Ukraine," 
which was then burned in a public square and buried in a 
previously dug pit, and a person was thrown out of a trolleybus 
for speaking Ukrainian. Or a serviceman with a trident 
[Ukrainian national symbol] on his cockade is beaten up. Quite 
recently, it was reported that with Meshkov's coming to power, 
Russian chauvinists let themselves go: Journalists are dismissed 
from Ukrainian editorial boards and threatened with physical 
reprisals. On 28 February, the Ukrainian Radio "Novyny" [News] 
program carried information to the effect that a television 
correspondent in Yalta cannot appear in the street -- people 
spit on her for the only reason that she conducts her programs 
in Ukrainian. The main thing is that nobody is held answerable 
for these antistate actions. Once revolutionaries gathered in 
underground groupings, then they went to streets with calls to 
overthrow the power and carried out terrorist acts. Later they 
organized an armed uprising. I believe that all of this, with 
the exception, so far, of an armed uprising, is present in the 
Crimea. What are you waiting for, Mr. Marchuk? 
  [Marchuk] Everything you have just mentioned is scandalous. 
These are bad signs, which point to tension in the Crimea. 
However, all of these actions must be specifically identified 
and studied in each specific case from the point of view of 
taking particular measures. If, for example, a journalist is 
dismissed from his job, we must find out who, why, and on what 
grounds. However, on the whole, all of these signs are, in 
fact, political in character and are instigated by some 
political forces in the Crimea. As for measures that are taken 
by the Security Service.... Unfortunately, I cannot disclose 
publicly what methods we are using. I can only say one thing: 
The situation in the Crimea would have been much worse if we 
had not taken such measures. 
  Generally speaking, the threat of decentralizing our state 
is 
among those which occupy a major place on the list of priorities 
of Ukraine's national security. For various reasons -- 
historical, economic, and political -- elements of this threat 
are concentrated in the Crimea. However, on the other hand, I 
wouldn't overdramatize the situation in the Crimea, as sounded 
in the question on the "Yugoslav Variant." This will not 
happen. The situation is totally different. We have sufficient 
forces and possibilities to prevent the Yugoslav variant from 
happening. 
  At the same time, there are a number of political forces in 
the Crimea that conduct propaganda activity detrimental to 
Ukraine. However, I emphasize once again that there is political 
propaganda activity conducted by Crimean political structures 
and their leaders who are creating this atmosphere. From the 
point of view of the Criminal Code, there is nothing illegal 
about them. That is why methods to deal with this phenomenon 
must be of corresponding nature. For any propaganda there must 
be counter-propaganda -- more effective, resourceful, and 
meaningful. I understand the patriotic aspirations of some 
people's deputies and their desire to somehow improve the 
situation in the Crimea. Unfortunately, however, by some of 
their actions and even visits they further exacerbated the 
situation instead of easing it. Here we must reckon with the 
fact that 1.2 million residents of the peninsula voted for 
Crimean President Meshkov. In other words, he is a legitimate 
president. The majority of the Crimeans expressed their attitude 
toward the situation by voting for Meshkov. Would you want to 
take measures against 1.2 million citizens? History knows such 
cases and God forbid their recurrence! 
  We are doing everything that special services are supposed 
to 
do, and under appropriate control. What we are doing is within 
the framework of Ukrainian laws. However, I am absolutely 
convinced that it is only in a centralized way, with the help of 
a well weighed and strategically planned internal national 
policy, pursued with regard to all regions -- not just the 
Crimea, but also Donbass, Transcarpathia, and Bukovyna -- that 
we will be able to resolve such problems in good time and in a 
quiet and civilized manner. It goes without saying that a 
certain role must be assigned to the Security Service, the 
Procurator's Office, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
  Ukrainian legislation provides for the case of 
responsibility 
for stirring up interethnic hostility. However, the situation 
is such that the first person who is called to account for 
antistate activity could in a certain environment become a 
"national hero," or there will emerge a powerful concentration 
of problems around that person, something that is even more 
undesirable for Ukraine. Foreign-based defense funds will be 
created, hunger strikes will be held, and the press in 
neighboring countries will talk about this -- immediately 
various support committees will appear. Of course, if the law 
is violated, such people must be called to account no matter 
what. However, I give preference to political methods of 
neutralizing such phenomena. If one person says something, this 
is not yet politics, but when 1,200,000 persons have such 
sentiments, this is already politics. This means that it is 
necessary to look at the situation seriously and to analyze the 
shortcomings.... 
  I know that the new Crimean administration has encountered 
economic problems. As a result, holding rallies has become 
secondary or even minor, since it has become necessary to 
resolve specific economic problems on a daily basis. A 
delegation of the Crimean Council of Ministers arrived in Kiev 
to discuss its budget and correlate it with the general 
Ukrainian one. Kiev showed an example of tolerance and, at the 
same time, of principled policy regarding the Crimea. The 
Crimea is a part of Ukraine, and there is no doubt about it. 
However, those aspects of economic activity for which the 
Crimean leadership has assumed responsibility have been shifted 
to it in full. 
  Regarding Crimea, I would like to offer this conclusion. If 
we pursue a restrained but far-sighted internal national policy 
(work on this is in progress) and a restrained economic policy 
-- the Crimea and Ukraine, the Crimea in Ukraine, and the Crimea 
through Ukraine -- in our relations with foreign countries and 
when the economic situation in the state improves, I am 
absolutely convinced that many questions will be removed from 
the agenda in the Crimean situation. However paradoxical it may 
sound, the present situation in the Crimea is much quietier than 
it was two months ago. Because much had been done from a 
political point of view, and then it was the turn of economic 
issues. 
  My view of the problem: The situation in the Crimea will be 
complex. The point is that there are certain political 
structures in Russia -- not only Zhirinovskiy -- that advance 
great-power slogans. It would be naive to believe that this 
question can be removed from the agenda. However, Ukraine has a 
serious and powerful argument -- the tripartite statement by the 
presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States whereby the 
latter two states guarantee Ukraine's integrity. This argument 
will work, because the world is not what it used to be 30 or 
even 10 years ago. More specifically, all of this will remain 
under serious international control. This will lead to a 
gradual stabilization of the situation in the Crimea. 
  [Passage omitted in which Marchuk condemns the sale of 
Hitler's "Mein Kampf" in Ukraine, but says that no legal action 
can be taken in this case] 
  [Bodenchuk] There are many letters where it is stressed 
that, in the past, our special service had no secrets from 
Moscow. Today, a part of the former Union service has become 
ours. Is something being done to create our own normal and 
independent special service? 
  [Marchuk] This problem has yet another aspect: Owing to 
those mutual relations, we also know much about what is going on 
in Moscow. Not as a result of some special actions. As regards 
our own secrets.... True, starting from 1991, our own state 
secrets began to form. I can assure you that they are already 
protected by our own methods. Today, Ukraine is within a single 
secret communication network -- the so-called high-frequency 
communication. It is now possible to make a phone call from Kiev 
to Ashgabat, Khabarovsk, St. Petersburg, or Minsk -- any place 
within the CIS. We also have closed communication with the 
Ukrainian Embassy in the United States. 
  State secrets are one thing, but there also exist secret 
methods used by special services. In some areas, we cooperate 
and exchange secrets, but where the secrets are strictly ours, 
they remain such. Regarding our operational possibilities, 
especially where this is associated with foreign countries, 
nobody is supposed to know them. This process is not developing 
smoothly in our country, and the Law on State Secrets was only 
recently adopted. The technology of its implementation has not 
yet been properly elaborated, but this does not apply to our 
institution. Our experience and technology of implementing it 
are more advanced than other state structures. There are 
especially many problems in the scientific and technological 
sphere. In the past, many scientific research institutes 
cooperated closely -- Novosibirsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kiev, 
Moscow, and others, and the academicians have long worked on the 
same projects, which were classified.... 
  [Olena Hubina, head of the MOLOD UKRAYINY political section] 
Much has recently been written about relations between the law- 
enforcement bodies, including the security services, and the 
UNSO [Ukrainian National Self-Defense]. What can you say about 
this. 
  [Marchuk] We have no relations with the UNSO. There is the 
UNSO and there is Ukraine's Security Service. The relevant 
article of the Criminal Code that was adopted fairly recently 
falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. That is why the Ministry recently initiated a criminal 
case against a group of UNSO members -- there were specific 
facts associated with weapons. The Ministry of Internal Affairs 
is conducting an investigation. Since this problem is not purely 
criminal, but involves political aspects and also contains 
certain nuances that are relevant to the problem of national 
security, mainly civic accord and social peace, we also assist 
in this work. 
  Regarding specific actions on the part of the UNSO, if there 
is at least one group action involving the use of force, no 
matter what article of the law is violated and in whose 
jurisdiction it is, all corresponding measures will be used. 
The law grants such rights to the Security Service, the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Procurator's Office, and the 
Ministry of Justice. By its actions, the UNSO may instigate a 
serious conflict, while earnestly believing that it is 
performing some highly patriotic deed. However, any political 
activity conducted by any organization that involves group 
actions and the use of force, not to mention weapons, must be 
removed from the political arena. This will undoubtedly take 
place in our society, with or without compliance on the part of 
such groups. 
  [Passage omitted on the KGB archives, which are now open] 
  [Bodenchuk] Yevhen Kyrylovych, the time assigned for 
telephone calls is up. Thank you for the conversation. 
Perhaps, you would like to take the opportunity to add 
something that was not touched upon today. 
  [Marchuk] I want to stress the following point. The money 
that we confiscate from criminals -- both in karbovantsi 
[Ukrainian coupons] [K] and in freely convertible currency -- 
would be enough to finance the Security Service. In last year's 
criminal cases alone, the amount of cash confiscated exceeded 
the Security Service's budget. As a result of examining about 
104 various departments, jointly with the tax inspection, but in 
accordance with our findings, tens of millions of dollars were 
confiscated and returned to the state. We prevented the use of 
counterfeit advice notes in the banking system and returned 
about K540 million to the state. Thanks to canceling contracts 
that might cause financial losses to Ukraine $523 million were 
saved. 
  By this I am stressing that the Security Service does not 
only spend money, but it also returns it to the state. We have 
administrations that could exist perfectly independently in 
conditions of profit and loss accounting. The "K" 
administration, the Intelligence directorate, and the Kiev, 
Donetsk, Lvov, and Khmelnytskyy administrations returned to the 
state more than was spent on running them. 
  I myself have said several times in the Supreme Council 
sessions that the Security Service must be financed solely by 
the state budget and should not depend upon any interest on 
profits. However, today, the situation is, unfortunately, such 
that we are raising the question of getting some interest (we 
are asking for 30 percent and will accept what we are offered) 
in order to at least temporarily finance specific types of 
activity. Mainly to finance the struggle against crime. 
  Second. We already have some indications that one of the 
political structures is unleashing an organized campaign against 
the Security Service. Our trouble lies in the fact that we know 
a lot but cannot say everything publicly. Well, we know who is 
doing this and for whose money. However, we can only talk about 
this after the court proceedings are over. There is still a 
very long way to the trial. Generally speaking, is it worth 
holding a trial at all? 
  God knows that we did not start this whole affair. Nor do we 
want to settle accounts. We react to criticism absolutely 
normally. However, when a person or a structure starts flinging 
mud at us at rallies, without having any arguments or idea about 
the work of the Security Service, this is already political 
activity and not criticism. 
  It is also known to us that some foreign structures are 
trying to interfere in the election campaign in Ukraine. Not to 
mention the fact that criminal capital is looking for ways to 
interfere in the election system. We know all of these cases in 
detail, as well as the amount of capital and personalities 
involved. When the necessary situation arises and when precise 
evidence is collected, we will inform the Central Electoral 
Commission and the media. Some people blame us for persecuting 
public organizations. However, we are beginning to unravel the 
chain from a different side, and it is not our fault where it is 
going to lead us. 
  Third. A strong potential for a fundamental work aimed at 
defending the state is being created within the Security 
Service. We are gaining experience. At our initiative, a 
corresponding legal foundation has also been created, although 
there is still much to be done there. We feel serious support 
on the part of the Supreme Council, its leadership, the 
president, and the government. I am convinced that all of these 
problems in the economic sphere and especially the political 
tension are a normal phenomenon from the point of view of 
political struggle. However, we have ways, equipment, and 
technology to put an end to all antistate activity. We are 
keeping antistate structures under control. This is our direct 
duty. I am sure that the people will support us in this. 
  [Hubina] If possible, one last question. Is there anything 
new in the case of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn [Rukh activist abducted 
in January 1994]? 
  [Marchuk] There are several well argumented versions. The 
investigation is being conducted by the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs with our active participation. A special group 
involving our officers has been created. I cannot say anything 
specific, because the investigation is in progress. There is 
some quite unexpected, if not sensational information. I think 
that some people would not like it to become public knowledge. 
  [Hubina] Can it be assumed that he is alive? 
  [Marchuk] Yes, of course. Incidentally, we also hope that 
he is alive. Because there are certain indications that.... In 
short, we hope that he is alive.
