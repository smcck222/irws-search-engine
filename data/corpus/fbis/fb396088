<F P=106> [Commentary by Igor Rotar: "The Crimean Tatar Majlis Meets </F>
Today. Is the Abkhaz Scenario Possible in Crimea?"] 
  [Text] The victory at the presidential elections of Yuriy 
Meshkov and his confrontation with the Crimean Tatar movement, 
which began immediately after this, are one further reminder 
that the situations in the separatist formations that gravitate 
toward Russia have much in common. 
  What do the situations in Crimea and Abkhazia have in 
common? 
The present situation in these two regions differs so much that 
even the mere fact of a comparison of relatively prosperous 
Crimea with semi-ravaged Abkhazia smacks at first sight of 
blasphemy. But there are analogies, for all that. 
  Both in Crimea and in Abkhazia, the separatist movements 
relied primarily on the "patriotic" forces of Russia. We would 
recall that Zhirinovskiy collected a substantial number of the 
signatures for his party's registration in Abkhazia. The 
national patriots are quite popular in Crimea also. Thus, Sergey 
Shuvaynikov, leader of the Russian Party of Crimea 
(Zhirinovskiy's closest ally), amassed approximately 14 percent 
of the vote at the presidential elections and came third among 
the candidates. Although the present president of Crimea is more 
guarded than his recent election rival, he is no stranger to 
imperial ambitions either. It is notable that Shuvaynikov's 
response during a television debate: "A great Russia, which 
would include not only Ukraine and Belarus, but also the 
Transcaucasus and Central Asia, could begin to be reconstituted 
from Crimea," was supported by the present president of Crimea 
also. And before the second round of voting, both the Russian 
Party and the Crimean communists called for people who had cast 
their votes for them to give them to Yuriy Meshkov. 
  But the solidarity of the leaders of the separatist 
movements 
with the Russian patriots has already become a commonplace. What 
is far more interesting is something else--the similarity of the 
processes in the two Black Sea republics. A new election law 
providing for national quotas was passed in Abkhazia in 1991. 
Thus the Abkhaz, who constitute approximately 17 percent of the 
population, obtained 43 percent of the seats. The Abkhaz argued 
the need for national quotas by the mass immigration in the 20th 
century of the Georgian population onto the territory of 
Abkhazia, which brought about an abrupt change in the ethnic 
balance (in 1897 the Abkhaz had constituted more than 80 percent 
of the population of the territory). 
  The parliament of the Crimean Tatars--the Majlis--also is 
presenting a similar initiative. In the opinion of the leaders 
of this organization, a bicameral parliament should be formed in 
Crimea. One chamber, with the right of veto, should consist only 
of the indigenous peoples of the Crimea--Tatars, Crimeans, and 
Karaimy. Approximately 250,000 Crimean Tatars live in Crimea 
today, which constitutes almost 10 percent of the population of 
the peninsula. Approximately the same number of their fellow 
tribesmen are forced, as before, to remain outside of their 
historical homeland. 
  The election of Yuriy Meshkov--an opponent of privileges for 
the indigenous people--as president of the peninsula could 
transfer the thus far smoldering conflict to a new phase. We 
would recall that at his first news conference, Yuriy Meshkov 
declared that the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people should 
register as a social and political organization, otherwise its 
very existence would be illegal. The response was immediate: 
"There can be no question of recognition of Meshkov as 
president," Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the Majlis, declared. 
In the opinion of the leader of the Crimean Tatars, the demand 
for registration of the Majlis is baseless and absurd. "Another 
twist of the spiral of confrontation awaits us," Dzhemilev 
concluded. The further course of events will depend not least on 
the position in relation to the president of Crimea that will be 
determined by the Majlis of Crimean Tatars which meets today and 
on the reaction to its decisions of the new-fledged president. 
  But whereas the Abkhaz managed not only to occupy the key 
positions in parliament but also to change in their favor the 
ethnic balance in the republic, a similar victory by the 
indigenous peoples in Crimea is unrealistic. A reason for the 
victory of the Abkhaz is explained by the fact that Tbilisi's 
ill-considered policy united practically the entire 
nonindigenous population of the unrecognized republic (more than 
50 percent of the population of Abkhazia). In addition, the 
geographical location of the unilaterally abolished autonomy, 
which is surrounded on all sides by kindred peoples, which did 
not fail to come immediately to the assistance of their fellow 
tribesmen, worked in favor of the Abkhaz movement. And, finally, 
the most important point--the practically unconcealed assistance 
to the supporters of separation from Georgia on the part of the 
Russian Army. 
  Not a single one of the above-mentioned factors operates in 
Crimea. The Crimean Tatars have found themselves in a minority, 
having supported (as distinct from the vast majority of the 
Russian-speaking population) Nikolay Bagrov, speaker of the 
Crimean parliament, who aspires to "conflict-free" relations 
with Kiev. The geographical isolation of the Crimean Tatars does 
not allow them to look for sufficiently effective assistance 
from kindred peoples. And, finally, the Black Sea Fleet, the 
majority of whose officers, as Mustafa Dzhemilev maintains, 
voted for Zhirinovskiy, would clearly not act on the side of 
Ukraine. 
  I would like to emphasize that I by no means suspect the 
leaders of the Crimean Tatar movement of an aspiration to 
resolve the problem militarily (the Majlis is headed by quite 
reasonable people). I have intentionally examined an obviously 
utopian idea in order to show the impracticability of the 
development of the Caucasus option in Crimea. 
  But it would hardly be appropriate to disregard the "Tatar 
card" completely, for all that. There are in Ukraine many 
organizations with an interest in an exacerbation of the 
situation on the peninsula in order subsequently to attempt to 
resolve it by the power method. Provoking a conflict is not that 
difficult. The increasing confrontation between Yuriy Meshkov 
and the Crimean Tatar movement is not the sole possible cause of 
destabilization of the situation. Although today the Crimean 
Tatars are not formally prevented from returning to the 
peninsula, it is still hard to consider the problem resolved. 
The quite complex political situation in the Central Asian 
states (the main region of deportation of the Crimean Tatars) 
and, as a consequence, the exodus of the Russian-speaking 
population, have brought about a sharp drop in the value of 
apartments in these states compared with the European part of 
the former USSR. Whereas earlier the Crimean Tatar, having sold 
his apartment in Central Asia, could with the money he made on 
this easily have purchased the same type of accommodations 
elsewhere, under the new conditions the money that he obtains is 
frequently barely sufficient to cover his fare. In addition, 
inflation has "eaten up" the savings accumulated over the years 
by the Crimean Tatars for their return home. There is today in 
Crimea a multitude of temporary settlements (people often live 
in adobe cottages, even): Having begun to build, the Crimean 
Tatars cannot put together the money to complete the job. In 
this situation, people could resolve upon spontaneous protests. 
And although their scale would not, of course, be comparable 
with those of the Abkhaz, they would not add tranquillity to the 
peninsula.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Pilat: "Where Crimea Is `Drifting.' </F>
Today Marks 40 Years Since the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium 
Decided to Incorporate Crimea Oblast Into Ukraine"] 
  [Text] And it was not by chance. The USSR's top party 
and state leadership saw how impoverished the peninsula was 
getting, with not enough water and power, and the people's 
wretched standard of living. The hard-working Crimean Tatar 
nation was deported in 1944. Practically no one was left to till 
the fields. 
  Ukraine brought the arid land back around. After the 
North Crimean Canal was built, water from the Dnieper came to 
the peninsula. Grape and grain crop yields increased greatly, 
and a crop new to Crimea appeared--rice. Today 83.7 percent of 
the Crimeans' water needs come from the Dnieper. Crimea provides 
only 15 percent of its own electricity; the rest comes from 
Ukraine. All of the peninsula's coal needs (1.65 million tonnes 
yearly) and sugar are also supplied by Ukraine. Moreover, the 
Republic of Crimea imports over twice the amount of consumer 
goods than it exports. 
  These are the figures, these are the facts. Even the 
most rabid Russian chauvinists cannot refute them. 
  Recently, especially since the election of President Yu. 
Meshkov, who hews to a pronounced pro-Moscow orientation, 
pro-Russian forces have done everything they can to belittle 
Ukraine's role in the Crimea, indulging in all kinds of 
falsifications and absurd fabrications. Typically, at Yu. 
Meshkov's press conference that took place immediately after he 
returned from a six-day trip to Moscow, he praised Russia to the 
skies for "granting Crimea most-favored status." To be sure, 
journalists never learned just whom Meshkov met and talked to, 
though he did say it was on the top level--"only the Lord God is 
higher." But what kind of summit could it be if Crimea's 
President met with neither B. Yeltsin or V. Chernomyrdin? 
  The Crimean Tatars are skeptical to Meshkov's announcement 
that Russia has appropriated 50 billion rubles to repatriate the 
deported nation. Anyway, they don't believe it, because for long 
years, despite endless talks, our neighbors have refused to help 
this unfortunate nation in any way. 
  At the press conference, Yu. Meshkov said in particular: 
"The 
journalist's job is to report the news, not to express his own 
point of view and urge people who support it to take part in 
transmitting it." Local observers' fears that the new regime 
might harass dissidents are proving true. In fact, the "first 
fruits" are already apparent. On 6 February Borys Kyyashko, the 
vice president of the Krym TV-Radio Company, took a 15-minute 
Ukrainian TV broadcast off the air (it was supposed to air a few 
hours after Meshkov's press conference). Incidentally, it was 
just a few months ago that Viktor Khomenko (Ukrainian TV's 
correspondent in the Republic of Crimea) literally begged Krym's 
administration for those 15 minutes a week. Now, evidently, the 
15 minutes are no more. 
  We have reported how the forces that brought Meshkov to 
power 
are hasseling Ukrainian journalists, and at rallies you hear 
calls for immediate reprisals against the "khokhols" 
["topknots"; a pejorative Russian term for Ukrainians], calls 
for firing and deporting journalists whose writings advocate the 
idea of reviving the Ukrainian state and national dignity of 
Ukrainians and Crimea's deported peoples. Well, there was a 
deportation in Crimea once. I wonder who now will assume the 
political roles of the comrades-in-arms of Stalin and Beriya? 
  Meanwhile, the local press is opposing possible Crimean 
Tatar 
statehood and a Medzhlis [muslim parliament] to serve as their 
representative body of authority, on grounds that the Republic 
of Crimea was restored on the territorial (?) principle and 
supposedly was never created on the principle of nationality. 
This is false. We know that the Crimean Autonomous Soviet 
Socialist Republic existed while Crimean Tatars lived there. A 
year after they were deported, the republic was converted to an 
oblast. This is just one of many pieces of evidence that the 
republic has the status of the Crimean Tatars' 
national-territorial autonomy. 
  Sad to say, neither Ukraine's President nor its Supreme 
Council are willing to see that the problem of the peninsula can 
be solved only by recognizing the Crimean Tatar nation's 
Medzhlis, and by granting that nation the right to territorial 
self-determination in accordance with international practice. 
Our country does not have the right (future generations will not 
forgive us) to allow the long-suffering Crimean Tatar nation to 
be an exile in its own land.

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Pronina: "The Crimean Republic: Astakhov </F>
Was the First To Receive the Suggestion To Resign. Who Is Next?"] 
  [Text] The situation developing in the Crimea puts 
the question to Kiev point-blank: What is to be done, since 
television remains the last bridge linking Kiev and 
Simferopol? 
  On 18 February the president of Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, 
suggested that the president of the Krym [Crimea] Television and 
Radio Company, Valeriy Astakhov, go into "voluntary-compulsory" 
resignation, explaining this only by saying that it is unlikely 
they can work together successfully. Although Yuriy 
Aleksandrovich himself seems to have no complaints against 
Valeriy Nikolayevich. 
  Maybe he does not, but then among those who do are some 
people's deputies who hold positions in the RDK [expansion 
unknown] and even the chairman of the fairly well known 
association "Impeks-55 Krym", Valeriy Averkin himself, who 
played a very effective role in shaping Yu. Meshkov as a 
politician in the first stages of his giddy career. But today 
Mr. Averkin, who has become involved in publishing activity, is 
already trying to influence the shaping of public opinion among 
all the Crimean petty bourgeoisie. In MESHCHANSKAYA GAZETA, 
which he owns, V. Averkin on 16 February advised the government 
how to "spank" the president of the television and radio 
company, V. Astakhov, whom he has always disliked, you see, and 
now, it is becoming clear, simply can no longer stand because of 
the pro-Rukh spirit on the screen. "Crimea television," the 
chief petty bourgeois of Crimea categorically alleges, "in its 
present form is a slap in the face to Russian-speaking Crimeans, 
regardless of their nationality... And it will be so until," V. 
Averkin stresses, "Mr. Meshkov begins to fulfill his 
pre-election promises, including those concerning television." 
  As is evident, he has already begun. But this "beginning" 
immediately raised some questions. First, is it reasonable to 
change the leader of the most popular and influential 
information medium at the height of the pre-election campaign? 
Secondly, how is it that the president of the teleradio company 
of Crimea, which is a part of Gosteleradio Ukrainy [State 
Television and Radio of Ukraine] and is financed from the state 
budget, works under a contract with this organization which will 
not terminate for 3 years? Thirdly, is putting the question in 
that way proper when today there is no legal mechanism to allow 
the president of Crimea to decide it on his own? The Supreme 
Soviet now has the deciding word; I hope it will be guided not 
by personal sympathies and antipathies, but by the norms of laws. 
  Valeriy Astakhov refused to accept Yuriy Meshkov's 
suggestion 
and intends to defend his rights in accordance with the law. 
  The Crimean branch of the Helsinki Civil Assembly was the 
first to defend the rights of the journalist. The Assembly's 
announcement says, among other things, that such a development 
of events at the height of the election campaign for the 
parliaments of Crimea and Ukraine opens up the way for political 
censorship in Crimea and to the expulsion from television and 
radio of journalists who have an independent opinion. 
  Out of fairness, I must say that it was precisely when V. 
Astakhov became the head of the television and radio company 
that it became possible to express various points of view, 
including ones which differed from the official point of view. 
With Astakhov's support, national editorial desks were set up 
and are operating: Crimean-Tatar, Armenian, Greek, and 
Bulgarian, plus the Si-Ay interethnic information service which 
works in four languages, and the new channels. This enabled 
television broadcasting to be increased from 6 hours a week to 
36. 
  Even now the pressure of the Rossiya Bloc is appreciable; it 
is not hiding its desire to obtain an absolute majority in the 
Crimean parliament and realize its main task--to join the 
peninsula to Russia. The arrival of a new leadership in 
television will undoubtedly make this majority overwhelming. The 
situation taking shape puts this question point-blank to 
official Kiev too: Television in Crimea remains essentially the 
last bridge linking Kiev and Simferopol, since the Ukrainian 
newspapers have been reaching Crimea irregularly and very late 
for a long time now. Incidentally, this is unlike the example of 
the Russian newspapers, which appear in subscribers' boxes and 
at kiosks on the day that the papers come out.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the rubric "Rescuing the </F>
Drowning": "An Unprecedented Scandal on Ukrainian Television"; 
with separate commentary by Vitaliy Zhuravskiy, chairman of the 
Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine: "Why the Christian 
Democrats Left the Television Studio"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  An Unprecedented Scandal on Ukrainian Television </H5>
  On Monday, 21 February, representatives of the Christian 
Democratic Party (KhDPU) and the Congress of Ukrainian 
Nationalists (KUN) gathered in the UT [Ukrainian Television] 
studio in preparation for conducting a pre-election interparty 
debate. But it did not take place; in voices shaking with 
emotion and fear, the UT commentators began to read the 
"instructional" letter from Tsentrizbirkom [Central Election 
Commission], by which the parties' leaders (top people) were 
prohibited from taking part in such debates (!?). 
  As a sign of protest, after making statements appropriate to 
the moment, both party delegations left the television studio. 
It was pitiful to watch the lonely moderators of the "television 
debates" pressed close to one another and trying somehow to 
"save face" for the completely and wholly compromised Ukrainian 
(read "presidential") Television, which is mired in lies and 
political censorship. 
  So the party leaders are prohibited from speaking on the 
air. 
But then at the most convenient times, in the best tradition of 
the era of stagnation, the chairman of Gosteleradiokompaniya 
(State Television and Radio Company), Nikolay Okhmakevich, a 
candidate for deputy in two rayons of Zhitomir Oblast, was 
allowed to film and "roll" short features of Ruzhin and 
Popelnya, where he is registered. 
  It will be interesting to see how events develop further: 
before last Monday UT had already offered the floor to a number 
of party leaders. But now it is prohibited. Next Monday is the 
next round of debates. We express our sincere condolences to our 
colleagues who found themselves in the role of scapegoats. 
<H5>  Why the Christian Democrats Left the Television Studio </H5>
  In the opinion of the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine, 
the directive read on the air is a flagrant legal offense. The 
Christian Democrats consider it a case of settling accounts for 
opposition to the "party in power." After all, preceding us, on 
17 February, three parties, two of which are clearly 
pro-presidential, were not refused permission to take part in an 
hour-long television debate. In this way Ukrainian Television 
violated Article 27 of the current Law: "From the time they are 
registered by election commissions and receive certification, 
candidates for deputy have an equal right to conduct an election 
campaign: to appear at pre-election and other meetings, rallies, 
parades, and sessions directly related to the election and on 
the mass information media (in the press and on radio and 
television)." 
  Six of our candidates for deputy were not allowed to 
communicate with television viewers and acquaint them with the 
pre-election platform of the KhDPU. 
  So on the basis of Article 18 of the Law of Ukraine "On 
Elections of People's Deputies of Ukraine," we protest the 
decision of the chairman of the Central Election Commission. And 
we are submitting this protest to the Supreme Court of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Philosophical Sciences Iryna </F>
Bekeshkina and Candidate of Philosophical Sciences Viktor 
Perebenesyuk, Ukrainian Scientific-Research Institute of Youth 
Problems: "Conflict--Where Shall We Expect Trouble?"] 
  [Text] 1. Young people's social-conflict potential 
and the basic spheres of conflict development 
  It shouldn't be necessary these days to argue how urgent the 
problem of social conflicts is. You don't need to be a sociology 
expert; all you have to do is live in this society to sense a 
growing mass dissatisfaction, irritation and fatigue, an erosion 
of values and loss of faith in the future. For at least a year 
we have felt a foreboding of social disasters and catastrophes, 
which makes it essential to study and forecast the development 
of conflicts in society. 
  Of course, our research (the Scientific-Research Institute 
of 
Youth Problems Sociology Laboratory, in a representative 
republic-wide sample, surveyed 1,475 respondents age 15 to 29 in 
10 regions of Ukraine) cannot pretend to solve all the problems 
of social conflicts, especially considering the almost complete 
lack of conflictological traditions in the old Soviet 
sociological literature. The authors' goal was not just to 
analyze the conflict potential of young people, who are the most 
active social group, and explore the basic spheres of future 
conflict, but also to ascertain the extent to which the 
conflicts that are typical of our society are similar to or 
different from those of civilized democratic societies. This is 
important in establishing our own national conflictological 
theory. 
  Our society's crisis is reflected in young people's 
dissatisfaction with nearly everything--their status in society, 
material security, and life in general; these are reliable 
indicators of social conflict. Some young people have adjusted 
to the situation, but they are not very numerous. Only 27.3 
percent are happy with their living conditions, 24.3 percent are 
happy with the food situation, 13.2 percent are happy with 
available clothing, 15.9 percent are happy with working 
conditions, 12.5 percent are happy with recreation facilities, 
9.8 percent are happy with medical services, 5.8 percent are 
happy about the ecology, and 12.3 percent are happy about their 
security. Only 9.8 percent are happy overall with living 
conditions, while almost half--44.5 percent--are unhappy (the 
remainder didn't have an unequivocal answer). 
  Another serious indicator of society's conflict potential is 
the public's subjective "foreboding" of conflicts. One third of 
our young respondents thought them possible in the near future, 
another 12.5 percent think social disturbances could erupt in 
Ukraine in a year, 13 percent think it could happen in two or 
three years, 17.1 percent relegate that prospect to the far 
future, and only 22.2 percent maintain that in principle it is 
impossible here. Hence, there is a definite syndrome of 
expectation of conflict in society. 
  Analyzing the concerns of today's youth and the problems 
that 
worry them most in the present crisis [Table 1], we conclude 
that the main sphere of potential conflicts will be the economy, 
the sphere of material concerns. 
  Problems of human rights, also the ecology, are quite 
important. The "forcible Ukrainianization" that has been used 
here and there to scare people, especially in traditionally 
Russian-speaking areas, does not especially worry young people, 
any more than a return to the communist past, which is obviously 
unrealistic. 
  2. Subjects of conflicts and youth's readiness to take 
part in protests 
  Who is the "face of the enemy," who personifies the main 
cause of our troubles, and how strongly is it imprinted in the 
mass consciousness? The mass media seem to have done everything 
they can to shape that image. At first, right after the collapse 
of the Soviet Union, it was the party apparatchik; then, after 
the restoration of the Ukrainian state, it was the Russian (or 
disguised local) chauvinist; now the national radicals are named 
most often. 
  It is a rather specific factor that prompts the search for 
"the enemy"--namely, the level of material security. It is those 
who belong to the lowest level of prosperity and have limited 
food who tend to blame certain social forces, in particular 
those of a nationalist bent. National radicals are seen as the 
enemy by 14.9 percent of those who have limited food and 14.9 
percent of those who barely make it from payday to payday, but 
only 4.7 percent of those who can afford anything they want. 
Great-power chauvinists are blamed by 15.7 percent of persons in 
the lowest material stratum but only by 6.3 percent of those in 
the highest. Incompetent careerists in the government are blamed 
by 37.2 percent in the lowest group and by 26.6 percent in the 
highest. This is natural, because those who have adjusted to the 
present difficult economic situation and have pulled themselves 
up by their bootstraps tend more to rely on themselves, their 
own efforts, and pay less attention those who are in power or 
striving for it. 
  Still, representatives of all social, professional, and 
property groups think that the main cause of potential conflicts 
is not the schemes of enemies but difficult living conditions, 
which are also the main cause of social tensions. 
  Young people's social dissatisfaction is reflected directly 
in their assessment of all links of state 
authority--legislative, executive, and judicial. The performance 
of the presidential branch is assessed somewhat more positively. 
Although representatives of the President were rated positively 
by only 6.7 percent (versus negatively by 39.9 percent), the 
President himself was rated positively by 14.5 percent and 
negatively by 38.8 percent. 
  Hence, the basic subjects of present-day social conflict are 
the public, on the one hand (in this case, young people), and 
structures of authority, on the other. 
  Could mass dissatisfaction with the authorities, forebodings 
of conflict, and a relatively high conflict potential really 
turn into civil disobedience and political disturbances? The 
well-known thesis of the particular radicalism of young people 
and their readiness to engage in open conflict has not been 
confirmed. It was found, in fact, that young people are even 
less inclined than other age groups to engage in conflicts. 
[Table 2] 
  3. Forecasting conflicts and problems of solving 
them 
  Young people do not accept but rather condemn violent, 
extremist forms of protest; they prefer lawful and moderate 
means [Table 3]. We may predict that the chief kind of struggle 
will take the form of economic strikes. 
  A greater tendency to use lawful forms of social protest was 
shown by young people in Kiev, the Republic of Crimea, and the 
Lvov and Transcarpathia regions, while violent methods are 
favored by the young people of the Donetsk, Zaporozhye, Odessa, 
and Kirovograd regions. Strikes are preferred primarily by those 
in the worker professions, while more radical methods are 
favored by younger persons who are not working or in 
college--that is, today's older highschool students; among 
social groups it is workers of various kinds, and owners. 
  Respondents were asked directly what factors might prompt 
them to take part in active forms of protest. More than half of 
them--54.4 percent--are not willing to do so under any 
conditions. The scenarios were designed to be extreme ones--the 
disappearance of basic food staples from store shelves, 
inflation, poverty, rampant crime, and so on. Hence, along with 
sharp deterioration of the situation in society we find a 
substantial gap between expectations of conflict and 
dissatisfaction with various aspects of social and economic life 
today, on the one hand, and young people's readiness to protest 
actively against these things, on the other. 
  For young people who can still conceive of factors that 
might 
prompt them to take part in acts of protest, the main one is the 
impossibility of earning a decent living. 
  The best way to prevent youth's conflict potential from 
turning into active forms of protest, in particular, is to carry 
out economic reforms that will give young people the chance to 
solve their most urgent problems--basically, material problems. 
In our opinion, it is not social protection in the form of 
miserly social assistance that ought to be the core of youth 
policy, but instead, prompt reforms toward a market economy in 
which young people, thanks to their greater mobility, energy, 
and their ability to upgrade their skills and adjust to new 
conditions, have a good chance of solving their problems on 
their own. 
  A major role in averting social conflicts is played by young 
people's enthusiasm (especially the younger set) for modern 
arts, in particular movies and music. Unsound policies toward 
mass culture can only worsen and stimulate social conflict. 
  One important element of a civilized mechanism of resolving 
conflicts in developed democratic countries is a multi-party 
system, where parties serve as intermediaries between the public 
and the state authorities and express the interests of various 
social groups and strata. The parties are the basic mechanism 
for institutionalizing conflicts, moving them out of the sphere 
of possible direct clashes and into parliament. Moreover, 
parties enable groups to reconcile their interests with those of 
society's, otherwise a party cannot win in general elections. 
  But besides the fact that our society has yet to form a real 
multi-party system, this is hindered by young people's political 
apathy (a trend that has been observed in recent years) and 
their loss of faith in political parties. Only 3.5 percent of 
young people now are members of youth associations, and only 1.6 
percent belong to political parties. Moreover, 1.1 percent of 
the respondents reported taking part in events put on in 1993 by 
Ukraine's youth organizations, and another 2.7 percent took part 
in a few. 
  We can see, then, that the existence of supposedly numerous 
youth associations (both political and non-political--for 
example, the MZhK [unidentified]), for all their apparent vigor, 
actually involves a rather narrow segment of young people, 
primarily the leadership apparatus of the organizations. They do 
not enjoy much support from young people and do not arouse much 
enthusiasm. Young people still prefer student organizations as 
well as sport, tourist, and ecological groups. Political youth 
associations rank in last place on this list, their members 
numbering only 15.8 percent, and are outranked by religious 
associations, which 24.1 percent of the respondents called 
worthwhile. So in the event of conflict relations with the 
authorities, today's youth associations are hardly likely to be 
effective advocates of young people's interests. 
  As for the political parties, if the elections had been held 
last year, only three political forces would have won over 5 
percent--Rukh (5.2 percent), the Democratic Party of Ukraine 
(5.8 percent), and the Greens (6.2 percent). Most of the young 
people--74.3 percent--could not name their favorite party; 37.7 
percent answered that they didn't know which party to vote for; 
18.2 percent stated they would not vote for any of the parties, 
on principle; and another 16.4 percent said they would vote for 
the candidate, not the party. 
  This can bring it about that if it comes to a conflict, it 
will not take place in institutionalized forms, where group 
interests are represented by parties, trade unions, and civic 
organizations, but in the form of disorderly actions enabling 
political forces whose interests do not really coincide with 
those of young people, to use them. 
  But if market reforms are carried out, conflict in society 
will come more and more to resemble the classic form prevailing 
in the developed Western countries, namely between rich and 
poor. Yet it will not be in the nature of inter-class conflict; 
rather, it will be manifested in pressure on the government by 
the poorest segments of society to redistribute the social 
product. A major problem of the conversion to the market will be 
unemployment, which will be condemned by almost all social 
groups except the owners. Unlike older groups, young people will 
not be willing to live on social assistance or be content with 
low-paying employment.

<F P=106> [Article by Tetyana Khomych: "The Counselor of Rutskyy </F>
Teaches Us To Live"] 
  [Text] Eastern Ukraine has succeeded in winning economic 
independence from Kiev. As we know, Ukraine's President, in 
response to the insistence of the oblast council officials and 
executive authorities of four oblasts, recently signed an edict 
granting regional self-government status to Dnepropetrovsk, 
Donetsk, Zaporozhye, and Lugansk oblasts. To put it more 
plainly, it is not yet a federative system. Politics abstracted, 
the new division of Ukraine into the "potato west" and the "iron 
east" is comparable to the story of the man who has a horse and 
puts a high fence around his farm so that his relative who 
doesn't have a horse won't be coming around to be jealous of his 
prosperity. 
  There hasn't been much prosperity in the east yet, though, 
and some might be inclined to predict that the isolation of the 
technological and raw materials-rich region will make its life 
harder--in which, as during the era of intensive industrial 
exploitation of it to meet the needs of the former USSR 
(especially metal needs), priority will go to the interests of 
industry and its magnates rather than to the people. 
  The recent Russian media report of rolled metal sent from 
Dnepropetrovsk to someone who doesn't need it in the Russian 
boondocks is just one episode of this kind of "management." 
Consuming the lion's share of costly energy imported from 
Russia, local plants are hoarding goods for export or for 
barter; and just as the ordinary local citizen got nothing from 
that little contribution to the state budget, now again he'll 
get the same from the contribution the regional authorities take 
from Kiev. Certain officials' assurances that "the metal will 
enable the region to supply itself with gasoline" are not making 
many people optimistic. The opulent life of owners of official 
cars running on fuel at state prices has long been a sore point. 
Meanwhile, it doesn't solve others' problems. 
  This serves to confirm people's belief that the "economic 
self-government" is beneficial only to the numerous corps of 
local "party authorities," solving problems of ambition rather 
than real ones. And although the authorities, as usual, answer 
with annoyance that economic self-government has nothing to do 
with territorial problems, the speech of officials in the 
Dnieper region has been increasingly tinged with the accents of 
Donetsians, who haven't concealed their intention to bring all 
of eastern Ukraine into their sphere of influence. But as to who 
wants to bring Donetsk into it there is no doubt. 
  A logical segment in this chain of events of Ukraine's new 
economic reality is the invitation of a group of Russian 
methodologists to Dnepropetrovsk to "formulate an optimal 
conception of regional "life support." It is reported that the 
group is headed by Yanovskyy, the eminent Russian economist and 
former counselor of Rutskyy; the consultants also include a 
number of champions from Yavlynskyy's team. 
  It should be added that the day before, the local press was 
pushing the notion of the almost complete lack of economists in 
Ukraine itself--promoted in an interview, incidentally, by none 
other than former Prime Minister Kuchma. The latest collapse of 
inferiority, which was in fact fostered by Kuchma's Cabinet and 
"reforms," impelled the seekers of economic independence from 
Dnepropetrovsk to seek rescuers for their independence in Moscow 
this time, not Kiev. All for the best, of course--yet many are 
afraid the lesson will follow the old programs....

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Ermakov, deputy of the Supreme Council </F>
of the Crimean republic, by A. Baranov; place and date not 
given: "It Is Still Gloomy in Crimea"] 
  [Text] A local constitution and parliament already exist on 
the Crimean peninsula, and there is also a president. The 
election of the president, however, is only half the issue. 
While daisies bloom in Alupka a session of the "main" 
parliament, lacking a speaker, is working out a new political 
course. 
  Ivan Ermakov, a deputy of the Supreme Council of the Crimean 
republic, is our interlocutor. 
  [Baranov] Ivan Fedosovich, elections indicated that the 
great 
majority of Crimeans are pro-Russian. Does it seem to you that 
Mr. Meshkov won a very perilous victory and should the Crimean 
parliament allow for the president with a speaker more familiar 
to Kiev? 
  [Ermakov] The experience of numerous elections of recent 
years indicated that we are still not so much living with 
democracy as playing at it. Candidates, making fantastic 
promises, are playing, and the voters are also playing, forcing 
themselves to believe the obvious fantasies. 
  In a month or so neither the one elected nor, surprisingly 
enough, the voters themselves recall those election campaign 
promises. I feel confident that Crimeans voted not so much for 
the person or his position as in opposition to the official 
course. As far as the "president-speaker" line is concerned, it 
is impossible to push through a convenient figure in our 
parliament. If Kiev wants to affect the state of affairs in 
Crimea, it is necessary to sharply change the position with 
respect to the republic, fulfilling numerous promises and taking 
decisive steps to expand economic rights of the region--right up 
to the creation of a free economic zone on the peninsula 
  [Baranov] What do you believe would be the advantages and 
disadvantages of Crimea having two currencies in circulation? 
  [Ermakov] Until a decision is made regarding a free economic 
zone in the Crimean region it is difficult for me to imagine a 
mechanism involving circulation of two currencies. If the SEZ 
(Free Economic Zone] is created, however, then the advantages 
are self-evident. That is indicated by international experience. 
  [Baranov] There is a lot of talk in Moscow about the desire 
of the Russian community in Crimea to take part in the political 
life of Russia. Is that really so? 
  [Ermakov] So far there have been too many problems within 
Crimea because of which that is hardly possible today. But the 
desire is an understandable one and I share it. 
  [Baranov] Will the citizens of Crimea be able to obtain dual 
citizenship? 
  [Ermakov] This topic was included in practically all of the 
election campaigns, including my own. An issue that important 
should not be put off. But neither the president of Crimea nor 
parliament have plans concerning secession from Ukraine, 
particularly in the light of economic disintegration, collapse 
of the financial system, and in the long-term, possibly the loss 
of statehood. We shall see what new members of the Ukrainian 
parliament will say--I am hoping for common sense. 
  [Baranov] Speaking of common sense. Is resumption of work on 
the construction of the Crimean Atomic Electric Power Station 
possible? 
  [Ermakov] The probability of that is low: first of all, 
everything has long ago been pilfered, and, secondly, it is 
necessary to return to the numerous expert reviews and determine 
whether it was emotion or real miscalculations by designers that 
did not permit the completion of this construction project. My 
view is that atomic electric power stations should not be built 
in Crimea. That would be a sin. Particularly since we have 
completely unique natural conditions for creation of 
ecologically pure sources of energy such as solar power stations. 
  [Baranov] What should Crimeans and Russian vacationers 
expect 
from the opening of a national bank and a currency exchange 
market this year? Crimean coupons? 
  [Ermakov] Because of the absence of a printing facility 
there 
can be no talk of a local currency. One should likewise not 
expect any radical improvement with the resolution of questions 
of financial health, but the problem with cash, credit, and 
foreign currency accounts will be eased. A true solution lies in 
the extension of statehood or the creation of a SEZ 
  [Baranov] Who will the Crimean customs service be 
protecting? 
The vacationers? 
  [Ermakov] So far talk about a customs service is limited to 
rumors. 
  [Baranov] What if a "Russian Crimea" movement should appear 
tomorrow in Russia, or, in the manner of Aksenov, some "ideas 
concerning a common fate," what would the attitude be toward 
that in Crimea? 
  [Ermakov] Like every normal person, I would welcome any 
movement in Russia, as well as in Belarus or Kazakhstan, which 
could benefit the people of Crimea with its multi-national 
population.

<H6>  Requirements Toward Investors Who Seek Tax Concessions </H6>
  Investment projects with the enlistment of foreign investors 
with regard to which investors aspire to receive tax, customs or 
credit concessions or insurance guarantees must fall under the 
priority spheres that are indicated in Section 2 of the Program, 
and correspond to these criteria: 
  3.1. The investment has to promote the creation of new jobs 
at enterprises at which the foreign investments are being made. 
  3.2. The investment has to be accompanied by the 
introduction 
of modern or advanced resource-conserving and ecologically safe 
types of technology. 
  3.3. The investment should be oriented toward the most 
efficient utilization of the raw-materials base of Ukraine. 
  3.4. The investment should promote a reduction in energy 
consumption per unit of the product being manufactured. 
  3.5. The products of an enterprise with foreign investments 
have to be market-competitive in international markets. 
  The determination that an investment project with the 
enlistment of foreign investment corresponds to the 
aforementioned requirements is made by the Agency for 
International Cooperation and Investment, based on the findings 
of an independent expert commission that is created by that 
Agency. 
  The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine prepares and publishes, 
through the Agency for International Cooperation and Investment, 
lists of the enterprises in which foreign investments are 
made--provided the criteria indicated in this section of the 
Program are upheld--that entail the granting of additional tax, 
customs and credit concessions or insurance guarantees. These 
concessions may be granted for investments in other entities 
that are not indicated on those lists as well, if they 
correspond to the criteria of this section of the Program and 
are made in the spheres indicated in Section 2 of the Program. 
  Foreign investments in enterprises that are indicated in the 
lists of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine are made on the 
basis of competition among investment projects. 
<H6>  Section 4 </H6>
<H6>  The Substance of the Concessions That Are Granted in 
Relation to Investment Projects in the Priority Spheres </H6>
  Foreign investment projects in the priority spheres 
indicated 
in Section 4 of the Program receive the following concessions, 
provided they meet the criteria in Section 3 of the Program: 
  4.1. The use of accelerated depreciation standards for 
machinery and equipment. 
  4.2. The period of exemption from taxation of profits 
(income) stipulated by Article 31 of the Decree of the Cabinet 
of Ministers of Ukraine, "Conditions of Foreign Investment," is 
increased regardless of the amount of foreign investment by one 
year for investments of up to 500,000 dollars U.S. inclusive, 
for two years for investments from more than 500,000 to five 
million dollars U.S. inclusive, for three years for investments 
of more than five million to 50 million dollars U.S., and for 
five years for investments of more than 50 million dollars U.S. 
  4.3. The granting of a tax credit on beneficial terms with 
regard to those types of taxes that are subject to payment in 
the first three years of existence of an enterprise with foreign 
investments. The indicated concession pertains exclusively to 
items 2.1.1--2.1.5 and 2.4.1. 
  4.4. The return of 50 percent of the import duty paid for 
bringing across the border from abroad goods for industrial 
purposes, and 100 percent for parts, units and assemblies 
imported under cooperation, if their use for the production of 
the enterprise with foreign investments is certified. This 
concession is applicable for the span of five years from the 
moment of approval of the foreign investment project by the 
Agency for International Cooperation and Investment. 
  4.5. The granting by authorized banks of credits on 
beneficial terms from a special budgetary fund that is created 
for that purpose, and on the basis of a credit agreement that 
must be approved by the Agency for International Cooperation and 
Investment and the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. 
  4.6. Insurance for the investment risks through a special 
budgetary fund for insurance guarantees. 
<H6>  Section 5 </H6>
<H6>  Improvement of the Legal Regulation of Foreign Investment </H6>
  It is essential, in order to create reliable legal 
guarantees 
with regard to foreign investment: 
  5.1. To resolve the issue of granting enterprises with 
foreign investments that have the status of a legal person in 
Ukraine the right to own the plot of land on which the objects 
of the investment are located. 
  5.2. To simplify the procedure for the participation of 
foreign investors in the process of privatizing state property. 
  5.3. To develop and adopt a procedure to compensate foreign 
investors for losses, including lost profits and moral losses, 
that are caused as a result of unlawful actions or the unlawful 
inaction of state bodies of Ukraine and their officials. 
  5.4. To make changes and additions to the Decree of the 
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, "Conditions of Foreign 
Investment," with regard to simplifying registration procedures 
connected with foreign investment. 
  5.5. To prepare and reach bilateral agreements with the 
countries that are the principal economic partners of Ukraine, 
as well as countries that could potentially be a source for 
enlisting foreign investments, to encourage and mutually protect 
investments and agreements on avoiding double taxation. 
  5.6. To adopt laws on the protection of intellectual 
property 
in accordance with prevailing international treaties 
(conventions) in this sphere, with the aim of creating 
conditions for investments associated with high technologies in 
Ukraine. 
<H6>  Section 6 </H6>
<H6>  Development of the Infrastructure of International Business 
and Other Preconditions of Foreign Investment </H6>
  It is essential, in order to create suitable conditions for 
enlisting foreign investment: 
  6.1. To make marked improvements in the operating techniques 
of the funds exchanges, commercial banks and insurance companies 
of Ukraine, create intersector networks of investment companies 
and funds of trust and holding companies, auditing and 
consulting firms with the enlistment in collaboration and 
consultation of specialists from the UN, the World Bank, the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the 
Commission of the European Union and other international 
organizations, as well as leading foreign firms. 
  6.2. To create within the Agency for International 
Cooperation and Investment a State Register of foreign investors 
and databases on the objects of foreign investment in Ukraine.

<H6>  Section 7 </H6>
<H6>  The Role of the Regions of Ukraine in Encouraging Foreign 
Investment </H6>
  The Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea, oblast, 
and Kiev and Sevastopol city state administrations can develop 
and approve their own programs to encourage foreign investment 
proceeding from the specific nature of the economy of the 
corresponding regions. These regional programs are realized 
through concessions that are granted within the limits of the 
corresponding local taxes and levies, as well as the budgetary 
funds of the corresponding regions. 
  This Program may be amended and clarified by resolution of 
the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine proceeding from changes in the 
economic situation, the appearance of new problems that require 
solution, and the gaining of experience in the sphere of 
enlisting foreign investment. 
<H6>  The Law of Ukraine on the State Program to Encourage Foreign 
Investment in Ukraine </H6>
  The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine decrees: 
  To establish that the relations associated with encouraging 
foreign investments in Ukraine and the establishment of the 
basic priorities for foreign investment in the economy of 
Ukraine are regulated by the State Program to Encourage Foreign 
Investment in Ukraine appended to this Law, and is an 
inalienable part of it.

  [Text] Due to the fuel shortage Ukraine is compelled to 
drain Russian gas in pipelines flowing in transit to West 
European countries. An ITAR--TASS correspondent was informed 
about this by one of the Ukrgazprom executives who wished to 
remain unanimous. Ukrgazprom representatives refused to indicate 
the amount of gas taken from Russia in that manner. 
  As indicated by material released by the UNIAN agency, 
thanks 
to its energetic "pirating," Ukraine provided heating for 
communal needs and prevented stoppage of major industrial 
enterprises during the recent freezing weather. At present the 
situation is becoming stabilized as temperatures start to rise. 
Several more days, however, will be needed in order to renew the 
export delivery of Russian gas in full volume. In accordance 
with Ukrainian - Russian agreements such acts require payment of 
fines.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Kuznechikov: "Has the Ukrainian National Bank </F>
Capitulated Again?"] 
  [Text] Reliable sources reveal that the National Bank of 
Ukraine, heeding arguments of the Cabinet of Ministers, 
allocated around four trillion karbovantsy for the stabilization 
fund. It is believed that the stabilization fund will be used to 
ensure timely payment of pensions and wages. It is highly 
probable that part of the funds will be used to pay of debts to 
agriculture and to increase the working capital of a number of 
enterprises, including those in the woodworking branch. All that 
is fine. However, from the same sources indicate that those 
trillions were hardly stored in the basement of the National 
Bank. Which means... Exactly. Serious apprehensions appear that 
the printing press was once again put to work. If that is the 
case then it is easy to imagine the catastrophic consequences of 
another emission. "Greenbacks" will rise sharply, while 
Ukrainian "candy wrappers" will go down. It is not unlikely that 
in a week or so a dollar will fetch 60,000 karbovantsy, if not 
more. It is not difficult to guess what unlimited opportunities 
will appear for foreign investors wishing to participate in our 
ill-starred privatization. Unless the government introduces 
protective measures they will be able to buy-up the country for 
a song. All of it--down to the last bolt. It is true that some 
of the optimists are nurturing the hope that occasionally even 
those sources worthy of attention can be wrong. 
  Meanwhile the dollar to karbovanets exchange rate in Kiev is 
already one to 59,000. Unfortunately the predictions are coming 
true.

<F P=106> [Article by Yevheniya Romaniv: "The Old Year in the Mirror </F>
of Statistics"] 
  [Text] Enough of wordy indignation over our economy. Even 
the sharpest, most withering and insulting diatribes are just 
"commentary" to which the latest feeble government has already 
adjusted. We can only console ourselves that it is doing so 
little that there will be fewer mistakes to correct later. 
Better to talk specifics--statistical figures, and look at the 
example of Lvov Oblast to see how well we're managing in our 
independent state. 
  Labor. In 1993 the volume of industrial output 
fell by 15.9 percent--more than three billion karbovantsy in 
monetary terms. December was the laziest of the 12 brother 
months (a 29.6-percent decline), meaning the crisis is getting 
worse. Nor did January put a stop to our decline; many 
enterprises, after all, started their new business year with the 
holidays. Two thirds of the oblast's enterprises reduced their 
output, especially the Yavorov and Rozdol sulphur operations, 
the tobacco factory, the Drogobych Oil Refinery, and the 
Elektron and Kineskop associations, where the decline ranged 
from 64.9 to 31 percent. 
  Farm work ended the year with just one plus on the chart of 
its basic indicators--grain production. Everything else (sugar 
beets, flax, potatoes, vegetables) shows nothing but minuses. 
Still, almost all the planned areas have been sown for grain and 
fodder for the next crop. 
  Meat production, like milk yields, declined between 31 and 1 
percent in all rayons. The "champions" were the livestock 
farmers of Nikolayevskiy, Pustomytovskiy, and Busskiy rayons 
(meat), and Brodovskiy and Mostisskiy rayons (milk)--not 
counting the hill territories, of course. The champion laggards 
were Gorodokskiy and Mostisskiy rayons, where egg production 
declined by 98 and 82 percent, respectively. 
  Prices. It was this pathetic labor output, 
clearly, that produced the chronic goods shortage, especially 
food--and immediately, secret prices reacted; lately they have 
been on the verge of jumping even higher. Throughout 1993 they 
rose by an average of 44 percent a month (70 percent in 
December). Leading the way were oil, fish products, and 
margarine (103-fold and 90-fold increases in the year), eggs, 
bread, butter, tea, meat, and dairy goods (81-fold to 71-fold), 
alcoholic beverages, sugar, cheese, confections, and groats 
(63-fold to 50-fold). 
  The cost of non-food products kept rising. The biggest jump 
(90-fold to 50-fold) was in hand soap and detergents, knit 
goods, and building materials. In price policy, 1993 was most 
discriminatory toward children, although it was only making up 
earlier imbalances caused by artificially reducing prices on 
those goods under populist slogans that were economically 
unsound. Preschoolers' clothing jumped 170-fold (!) while 
women's rose 102-fold and men's 82.9-fold. 
  In village markets, prices on honey, oil, lard, poultry, and 
eggs rose 82-fold to 55-fold. Sales in the markets, as in the 
stores, declined due to people's reduced purchasing power. On 
the black market, the highest prices were on children's clothing 
and shoes, furniture, electrical appliances, perfume, caviar, 
and imported food items. 
  Wages. It's not by chance we're discussing wages 
right after prices, although they ought to be tied to labor. By 
objective economic laws, everyone should receive as much as he 
earns. Hence, if a plant's output declines there ought to be 
minuses on the payroll too. Our wage system, brought up in a 
troubled home where Mother Labor's vote counted less than Father 
Social Protection's, took the wrong path. Instead of going 
according to the results of output, wages blindly followed 
prices and neglected their own worth month by month. The result: 
overall production has dropped appreciably while pay has risen 
substantially. In November, for example, average wages rose by 
25.4 percent to 254,900 karbovantsy. That's the result of a 
destructive price policy that is out of sync with labor output 
and remuneration. We preach world prices but ignore world 
production and world wage levels. That's why we're in such a 
fix. Even that big pay jump in November--received in December, 
by the way--was not enough to cover the cost of December's 
grocery basket. Compare average wages of 254,900 with fixed food 
costs of 416,943 karbovantsy. 
  The very concept of "average wages" today is doubtful. The 
gap between the highest and lowest average sectorial wages 
widened greatly--8.3-fold in November, for example. Wage 
fluctuations are even greater between specific sectors. Workers 
in financial organs (banks) and insurance were paid an average 
of 1,216,700 karbovantsy, versus 146,500 in health care and 
social security and 165,500 in culture. In industry, wages were 
296,300, but this relatively decent figure was due to miners; 
workers in other trades got considerably less. 
  Demography. Given these statistics, I think, we 
can understand the continuing demographic decline in 1993. 
Natural increase fell by 40 percent over the year and stood at 
1.2 per 1,000 inhabitants, versus 2 per 1,000 in 1992. It was 
due to a birth rate that fell from 13.2 to 12.6 per 1,000 
combined with a death rate that rose from 11.2 to 11.4 per 
1,000. In all civilized countries, demographic indicators lead 
every other statistic. Prosperity there is not measured by the 
number of cars or kilograms of sausage per inhabitant but by the 
standard of living in the particular country--because people who 
live well live a long time. Sad to say, we can't be proud of 
that statistic or any other. 
  Let Bismarck's statement that every nation has the 
government 
it deserves be our guide during this pre-election period. And 
although we won't be electing a government but a parliament, it 
will still have to approve the Cabinet of Ministers and will 
determine whether it deserves the people's trust. Which depends 
on us. Let's not be wrong!

<F P=106> [Report of the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine on </F>
Ukraine's Socioeconomic Situation in 1993: "The Prolonged Crisis 
Continues"] 
  [Text] In 1993, the gross domestic product in the economy 
of Ukraine decreased by 14 percent for the year, the produced 
national income--by 15 percent, and national labor 
productivity--by 13 percent. The trend in the slump in the gross 
national product and national income continues, although some 
slowing down in its rate has been noted. 
  Difficulties with material-technical supplies, the 
disruption 
in economic relations, the continuous increase in prices, and 
the insolvency of enterprises have led to a further drop in 
industrial production. The slow process in destatization did not 
give positive results. A reduction in production occurred at 
enterprises of almost all forms of property, except collective, 
but its negligible proportion had no effect on the results of 
the work of all of industry. 
  While in the first half year of 1993, the rates of cuts in 
production slowed down somewhat, in the second half of the year 
the slump in production intensified and for the whole year 
exceeded 7 percent. Labor productivity fell by 3 percent. Every 
second enterprise reduced the volume of production of products 
compared to last year. The biggest slump in production was in 
enterprises of the oil refining, chemical and petrochemical, and 
coal industries, in ferrous metallurgy, the building materials 
industry, and in light industry. 
  The intensification of crisis phenomena in industry is 
connected in some measure with the reduction in production 
volumes in the fuel-energy complex. The extraction of the basic 
types of fuel in a standard calculation was reduced for the year 
by 12 percent. The extraction of oil and gas condensate was less 
by 5 percent, coal--by 13 percent, including coke--by 17 
percent, and gas--by 8 percent. As a result of a decrease in 
extraction and a reduction in imported deliveries, the volumes 
of refined oil decreased by 15 million tonnes, or by 39 percent, 
and, as a consequence, the output of motor vehicle gas was cut 
by 35 percent (1.9 million tonnes), diesel fuel by 24 percent (2 
million tonnes), mazut fuel by 40 percent (7 million tonnes). 
The shortage of fuel affected the volumes of production of 
electric power--at thermal electric power stations whose share 
in the total development of electric power exceeds 60 percent. 
For the year, the thermal power stations cut the production of 
electric power by 16 percent, as a result of which its total 
output decreased by 9 percent. At the same time, more electric 
power was produced by nuclear and hydroelectric power stations 
(by 2 and 39 percent, respectively) than in 1992. 
  The tense situation with the production and supply of 
fuel-energy resources had a negative effect on other branches of 
industry, and especially on metallurgy, one of the most fuel and 
energy-consuming industries. By comparison with the 1992 level, 
the production of all of the main types of products of industry 
decreased. 
  Production was cut in nonferrous metallurgy enterprises, in 
the chemical industry, in machine building, and in the building 
materials industry. 
  The situation remained difficult in agriculture in 1993. At 
the same time, some symptoms of its stabilization appeared. The 
rates of reduction in the production of agricultural products 
were reduced substantially. The volume of gross products in 
comparison with the previous year decreased only by 2 percent, 
and, at the same time, plant-growing products increased by 7 
percent. 
  Farms of all categories produced 45.6 million tonnes of 
grain 
in weight after processing, which is 18.3 percent more than in 
1992; sugar beets (factory)--33.6 million tonnes (by 16.8 
percent); potatoes--20.9 million tonnes (by 3.3 percent more); 
vegetables--5.8 million tonnes (10.1 percent more); and 
sunflowers--2.2 million tonnes (at the level of the previous 
year). 
  The situation in livestock raising remains acute. Sovkhozes 
and collective and interfarm agricultural enterprises in 1993 
produced 2.6 million tonnes of meat in live weight, which is 23 
percent less than in 1992; 11.6 million tonnes of milk (by 10 
percent less); 6.1 billion eggs of all types (by 18 percent 
less). The production of livestock products in subsidiary farms 
of the population increased. 
  A negative trend in the reduction of the total number of 
cattle and a drop in its productivity in the public sector 
continued. 
  Capital construction during the report period was 
characterized by an imbalance between investment programs and 
the financial capabilities for their implementation in 
connection with the continuous increase in prices for building 
materials and energy sources. 
  Because of inadequate financing (in the main), the start-up 
program for putting important production and environmental 
protection facilities into operation was not implemented. Out of 
343 facilities that were included by name in Ukraine's 1993 
state contract, only one-sixth were put into operation, of which 
almost a fourth were only partially implemented. 
  A further worsening occurred in 1993 in the condition of 
national economic and passenger transportation by all types of 
transport of the country. 
  During 1993, the unbalance of state finances became more 
pronounced. According to preliminary data of the Ministry of 
Finance of Ukraine, the consolidated budget of Ukraine for the 
year came to a deficit of 7.9 trillion karbovantsy, which 
constituted 6.8 percent with respect to the gross domestic 
product. 
  There was an expenditure from the budget for the national 
economy of 12.6 trillion karbovantsy, or 21.8 percent of all 
expenditures; for defense--2.8 trillion karbovantsy, or 4.9 
percent; for administration--3 trillion karbovantsy, or 5.2 
percent, and the expenditures associated with the elimination of 
the aftereffects of the Chernobyl catastrophe totaled 1.8 
trillion karbovantsy, which is 0.7 trillion karbovantsy less 
than the payments to this fund. 
  The deficit of the state budget for 1993 totaled 10.3 
trillion karbovantsy, and in December alone it increased by 2.9 
trillion karbovantsy, or by 39 percent. Expenditures for the 
social protection of the population made up a substantial share 
of the expenditures of the state budget--37.4 percent of all 
expenditures. 
  The volumes of credit investments of the banking system in 
the national economy for 1 January 1994 totaled 54 trillion 
karbovantsy. The emission of money for the year increased by a 
factor of 25 and totaled 12.3 trillion karbovantsy. 
  The monetary incomes of the population totaled 65.7 trillion 
karbovantsy. The expenditures of the population totaled 54.2 
trillion karbovantsy. The wages of the workers of the state 
sector of the economy for last year increased almost by a factor 
of 50 and in December 1993 totaled 793,000 karbovantsy, as 
compared to 16,000 in the corresponding month of 1992. The 
average monthly wage of kolkhoz workers increased for the year 
by a factor of 29.5 and totaled 106,000 karbovantsy. The level 
of inflation rose significantly in 1993. Prices for consumer 
goods and paid services increased by more than a factor of 100. 
  The labor resources of Ukraine in 1993 totaled more than 29 
million persons. A total of 557,500 temporarily unemployed 
citizens were registered with the state employment service. For 
1993, 11 billion karbovantsy were expended from the population 
employment assistance fund for unemployment benefits. 
  The size of the population of Ukraine on 1 January 1994 was 
52.135 million persons, and it decreased in comparison with 1993 
by 0.2 percent, or by 109,000 persons. 
  More than one-fourth of the entire population of Ukraine 
consists of pensioners, whose number is increasing every year. 
The government has undertaken measures for the social protection 
of the population. 
  The crime-conducive situation has remained difficult. The 
number of crimes registered by organs of Internal Affairs 
exceeded the level of 1992 by 12 percent and totaled 539,300 
cases; every fourth registered crime is grave. 
  An extremely tense situation, conditioned by a sharp 
decrease 
in the output of commodities, has developed in the consumer 
market. For the year they were produced in the amount of 74 
trillion karbovantsy at wholesale factory prices, which is 16.5 
percent less than in 1992. In 1993, the quality composition of 
the food ration of the population deteriorated. The consumption 
of meat and meat products was only 46 kilograms, which is less 
in comparison with the previous year by 7 kilograms, milk and 
milk products--275 kilograms (less by 10 kilograms), eggs--193 
each (less by 34 eggs), fish and fish products--3.2 kilograms 
(less by 4.1 kilograms), sunflower oil--8 kilograms (less by 2.6 
kilograms), sugar--39 kilograms (6 kilograms less). There was an 
increase in the consumption of bakery products, potatoes, fruit, 
berries, grapes, vegetables, and melons and gourds. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  Seventy-one stock exchanges were established in the 
republic, 
and 41 were conducting practical activity. The volumes of 
concluded agreements on the exchanges totaled 313 billion 
karbovantsy, which is more than in 1992 by a factor of almost 
10. The growth was due mainly to high prices for food products, 
commodities, and services. 
  According to preliminary data, the volume of the foreign 
trade turnover of Ukraine with countries that were formed on the 
territory of the former USSR for 1993 totaled 58.8 trillion 
karbovantsy, including exports--20.7 trillion karbovantsy and 
imports--38.1 trillion karbovantsy, which resulted in a negative 
balance in foreign trade of 17.4 trillion (mainly owing to 
payments for natural gas, oil, and oil products), including with 
the Russian Federation--12.6 trillion. The Russian Federation 
has the biggest share in the foreign trade turnover of Ukraine 
with states of the former USSR--75 percent. 
  In the second half of 1993, the process of destatization of 
the property of industrial enterprises accelerated somewhat. The 
proportion of enterprises of a nonstate form of property in the 
overall number of enterprises increased to 32 percent, as 
compared with 25 percent in 1992. These enterprises produced 
output for 47 trillion karbovantsy, or 29 percent of the total 
volume of products. The process of the destatization of 
enterprises in the sphere of services is continuing. The number 
of leased enterprises of everyday services of the population is 
increasing. The process of privatization of the state housing 
fund has started and has picked up considerable speed.

Khmelko, chief of the department of sociology of the Kiev-Mohyla 
Academy University, under the rubric "Election 94--27 March": 
"Deep Down, Most of Us Are Private Operators"] 
  [Text] Given that the greatest concern of voters is the 
condition of the economy, their attitudes toward the main 
alternatives on which various proposals for overcoming the 
economic crisis are actually based are particularly interesting. 
The well-known political forces fall on the common ideological 
cliche of "capitalism or socialism" in order to characterize the 
opposition of these alternatives. However, this merely makes the 
essence of the issue mythical because actually this is about the 
opposition of two kinds of "capitalism": one--with free 
competition, which defends the right of man to private economic 
activities and ensures free competition among various forms of 
ownership and organization of production, and the other, which 
we are directly familiar with, is state-monopoly capitalism, 
which bans (or extremely constrains) private economic activities 
by the people, destroys free competition, and protects the 
monopoly of the machinery of state on the command management of 
the entire economy. 
  Capital forms the economic foundation of both these systems. 
However, in the former case it is mostly private capital, and in 
the latter case solely state capital. For almost 60 years (since 
the end of the 1920's) we have lived under the absolute 
dominance of state property and its administrators. In the last 
few years (since the late 1980's), a small proportion of 
capital, approximately 8 percent, has become private. At 
present, when state capital remains dominant but the process of 
privatization is advancing somehow, albeit at a snail's pace, 
Ukraine is confronted with the decisive choice of who to elect 
to the new parliament: those who will stop the development of 
private enterprise or, on the contrary, those who will support 
its development. 
  At present, not only the fate of Ukrainian independence but 
also the welfare of a majority of Ukraine's citizens hinge on 
the correct resolution of this issue. For this reason the 
attitude of voters toward the development of private enterprise 
in Ukraine and, accordingly, toward private property is 
particularly interesting. 
  What is the opinion of urban voters? 
  Only 11 percent of those surveyed believe that private 
enterprise should not be developed, 14 percent refrained from 
giving a firm answer, and an impressive majority--75 
percent--believe that private enterprise should be developed. 
More than one-half of the latter come out in favor of developing 
private enterprise as rapidly as possible. 
  These data indicate that despite the catastrophic condition 
of the economy and the efforts of certain forces to pass off the 
appearance of the private enterprise sector as the main reason 
for the economic crisis and impoverishment of the people, a 
majority of people do not believe this (75 percent of urban 
voters amounts to more than one-half of all voters). In the last 
two years the proportion of urban residents who do believe it 
has increased only slightly. According to data in surveys by the 
Kiev International Institute of Sociology together with the 
research department of the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) in 
December 1991 and November 1992, at the time respectively 6 and 
10 percent of those polled among the urban population (answering 
the same questions as this time) came out against the 
development of private enterprise. On both occasions, 83 percent 
came out in favor of developing private enterprise--only 8 
percent more than at present. 
  It is also important to note that opponents of the 
development of private enterprise are almost 1.5 times less 
numerous among those who intend to turn out for the elections 
and those who are not sure than among those who do not intend to 
turn out. On the other hand, supporters of the development of 
private enterprise account for 69 percent of those who do not 
intend to vote and 72 percent among those who are not sure, 
whereas among the voters who intend to vote the proportion of 
supporters of private enterprise comes to 79 percent. Of these, 
42 percent came out in favor of developing private enterprise as 
fast as possible, and 37 percent believe that private enterprise 
should be developed slowly and gradually. 
  Among the urban population as a whole, men (79 percent) came 
out in favor of developing private enterprise more often then 
women (71 percent). This support falls with age (from 86 percent 
among young people to 59 percent among those over 60) and grows 
with the educational level. Among those with less than a 
secondary education, 57 percent of urban residents have a 
positive attitude toward private enterprise, among those with a 
complete secondary education--77 percent, and among those with a 
higher education--87 percent. The proportion of such voters is 
notably greater among students (95 percent), managers (89 
percent), servicemen (88 percent), and specialists (86 percent) 
than among clerical employees (79 percent) and workers (76 
percent), and especially retirees (58 percent). Among unskilled 
workers, 64 percent came out in favor of private enterprise, 
whereas among skilled workers the figure was 82 percent. 
  Overall support for the development of private enterprise is 
actually the same among Ukrainians and Russians (73-74 percent). 
However, "gradualists," if you will, the supporters of the slow 
and gradual implementation of this development, are somewhat 
more numerous among Ukrainians--37 percent compared to 32 
percent among Russians. Among the latter, "radicals," supporters 
of the fastest possible development of private enterprise, are 
somewhat more numerous: 41 percent against 37 percent among 
Ukrainians. 
  The difference between the urban populations of the Western 
and Eastern Regions is even greater in this regard. The 
proportion of "gradualists" among voters in the West (45 
percent) is considerably greater than in the East (25 percent), 
and the proportion of "radicals" in the East (41 percent) is 
somewhat greater than in the West (35 percent). 
  However, in general it might make sense for candidates for 
Supreme Council deputy to factor in the fact that even in the 
east of Ukraine an impressive majority, two-thirds of those 
surveyed, come out in favor of the development of private 
enterprise. This is to say nothing about the south and the 
center, where more than three-quarters of urban voters come out 
in favor of it, and in particular the west, where this 
proportion reaches four-fifths.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of External Economic Ties Oleh </F>
Ivanovych Slyepichev, by Anatoliy Kraslyanskyy; place and date 
not given: "Commerce is not Trade. Commerce Is an Art, or How 
Can Anyone at the External Economic Department Be Optimistic in 
1994?"] 
  [Text] A package of documents that will regulate our 
country's foreign economic activity in 1994 has been submitted 
to Ukraine's Supreme Council for consideration. It will be a 
continuation of work started at the end of last year, when the 
Ministry of External Economic Ties asked Ukraine's Supreme 
Council to introduce certain changes into those governmental 
edicts that regulate export-import relations. We turned to 
minister O. Slyepichev with a request to comment on the changes 
that will take place in 1994 in this branch, which is important 
for independent Ukraine. 
  [Slyepichev] Just two years have passed since Ukraine 
achieved its independence, and it is perfectly understandable 
that now, during the period of development of our young state, 
we must create our own system of external economic relations 
with the world community. This is a quite complex process -- 
the system will improve in the course of years, but one thing 
may be said with certainty: Ukraine's external economic policy 
must be nationwide, clear and legally balanced, and not narrow 
and departmental. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] What proposals did the External Economic 
Department submit to the Supreme Council and what does it 
primarily want to achieve this year? 
  [Slyepichev] First is the encouragement of exports through 
extensively liberalizing export policy. For this, it is 
envisaged to abolish the double use of the nontariff (quota or 
nonquota) and tariff (extra-quota or taxed) regulation of 
exports of the same types of goods, to introduce preferred 
issuing of quotas to producers of corresponding products, and to 
improve the sale of quotas at auctions. 
  However, it is also necessary to know how to use quotas. On 
last year's example, we know that our country produced more than 
25 million tonnes of metal, but only about 8 million tonnes were 
in fact sold. In my opinion, it is necessary to establish a 
procedure to have quotas passed on to other exporters if they 
are not used within three months. 
  Second, the provision of an effective structure of exports 
and the formation of imports taking into account the interests 
of national producers. It is extremely important to separate 
exports from imports, to revise the rates of customs duty on 
imports during barter operations, proceeding from the required 
supply of critical imports, especially raw materials. The 
purchase of those products, which are manufactured or may be 
manufactured in Ukraine, must be limited. 
  I believe that it is necessary in 1994 to introduce import 
quotas to use our currency resources rationally. 
  Third, it is necessary to intensify state control over 
external trade operations and to ensure the timely and full 
transfer of hard-currency earnings to the State Currency Fund. 
In my opinion, to this end, we must adopt a system of 
guaranteed settlements for highly-liquid types of products. I 
do not only mean preliminary payments, but also, for example, 
methods of closed accrediting in Ukrainian banks. When goods 
cross the border, such a letter of credits is opened, and the 
hard currency remains in our state. Besides, it is necessary 
substantially to reduce hard-currency accounts opened by 
national exporters abroad with the permission of Ukraine's 
National Bank and radically to revise the procedure for granting 
such rights. 
  Finally, to ensure that, during our integration into the 
system of world trade, the state will not be answerable for the 
carelessness and incompetence of its exporters, it is necessary 
to set, on a monthly basis, indicative prices of main types of 
export products on traditional international markets and their 
minimal levels below which exports are forbidden. 
  It is only with the help of such a complex of measures that 
we will be able to ensure the reduction of the trade deficit, 
improve external solvency, and earn hard currency in amounts 
sufficient for our important internal needs. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] There has recently been much talk on 
establishing special conditions for exports. What is behind 
this talk and will there be certain restrictions to the state's 
advantage? 
  [Slyepichev] I think that, in our conditions, this is a 
perfectly normal phenomenon. There are things that are 
strategically important for us: Nonferrous metals, petroleum 
products, precious metals, and so on, whose sale must only be in 
the hands of special authorized exporters. However, they must 
be appointed on the basis of competition. 
  Besides, the state must also control some types of export 
products (weapons, metal products, or agricultural raw 
materials) that may earn us particularly large amounts of hard 
currency. In accordance with state contracts, manufacturing 
enterprises or individual external trade organizations will sell 
these goods on a tender basis with state guarantees for the 
deliveries from storage of enterprises to ports. All money 
obtained from such sales must be transferred to the state 
budget. This approach will only do us good. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] Your strategy is clear, and it seems to be 
instrumental at this stage of economic management. However, to 
implement it, it may be necessary radically to change the 
legislative basis. Will you be proposing a new bill on external 
economic activity? 
  [Slyepichev] We have a rather good law on external economic 
activity, and the Supreme Council did the right thing in 
canceling additional decrees in this sphere. Ministry 
specialists and scientists did their best just to introduce 
certain amendments, reflecting today's realities, and the law 
will work fine. Businessmen and business circles need, first and 
foremost, stability in the economic policy, and this stability 
may only be ensured by legislation. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] To conclude our conversation, are you in 
favor of restoring the management of internal trade at a state 
level? How, do you think, this problem may be resolved? 
  [Slyepichev] It is true that, today, we are criticized for 
creating administrations for questions of trade, but there can 
be no talk of returning to the old times. We are doing 
everything to establish order in the provision of people with 
basic commodities and are trying to renew everything good that 
we had, for example, the holding of wholesale industrial fairs, 
with the participation of several oblasts, where consumer goods 
may be purchased. However, the main thing is that there must be 
single norms and rules for accounting and controlling commodity 
circulation for all those who are engaged in trade, irrespective 
of the form of ownership. 
  Trade must be carried on properly, proceeding from the 
knowledge of the conditions prevailing in the world, market 
laws, and exchange rates.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Pavlovych Khrushchov, head of </F>
Lithology Department, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Institute of 
Geological Sciences: "Consultation With Geologists Needed To 
Avoid Mistakes"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] We received a letter from Poltava's Zelenyy 
Svit [Green World] Association expressing alarm over 
uncontrolled development of nuclear energy in Ukraine. 
"Ukraine's citizens want answers: Where are they going to store 
highly radioactive wastes adding up to 30-40 kilograms per tonne 
of spent fuel? Will they be safe during transport? Have the 
scientific problems of storing the wastes in Ukraine been worked 
out?" Ways to safeguard the wastes are the subject of our 
correspondent's interview with Dmytro Pavlovych Khrushchov, head 
of the Lithology Department, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences 
Institute of Geological Sciences. 
  [Correspondent] Dmytro Pavlovych, how urgent is the problem 
of storing radioactive wastes in Ukraine? 
  [Khrushchov] The basic source of such wastes here is the 
operation of AESes [nuclear power plants], also the fallout from 
the Chernobyl AES disaster. According to experts of DKBYaE 
[State Committee on the Use of Nuclear Energy], the amount of 
radioactive wastes subject to burial in deep geologic formations 
by the year 2010 will be about 60,000 cubic meters. Plans used 
to call for sending the wastes to Russia for processing, but now 
Russia has a law banning the burial of wastes from other 
countries, so now we even have to take back the wastes we sent 
there earlier. There's really only one way to solve the problem: 
bury the hazardous material in our territory in suitable 
geologic formations capable of keeping it safely isolated from 
the biosphere. 
  [Correspondent] How are other countries handling the 
problem? 
  [Khrushchov] Many countries have been researching and 
experimenting with the problem for 20 to 30 years; the work is 
laborious and takes considerable capital investment. Active work 
is going on in France, England, and Spain, and Canada and 
Belgium have underground laboratories. Meanwhile, the practice 
is to place the wastes in special mine shafts for long-term 
storage. Germany has an experimental program of burying 
medium-radioactive wastes in salt strata. Other countries are 
looking into similar possibilities available to them: the Finns 
are studying granite strata in the Baltic Shield, the Dutch are 
looking into salt. The U.S. has excellent prospects in that 
regard in Nevada's Yucca Mountains, where the rocks and climate 
are right (very dry) and there are no local population problems, 
as they were moved out long ago because of nuclear weapons 
testing. 
  [Correspondent] What are Ukraine's prospects? 
  [Khrushchov] Ukraine has several options. A large part of 
its 
territory is on the Ukrainian Crystal Shield, and the 
Dnieper-Donets Depression has clay strata and salt. But it's 
hard to make the final choice. Problems of isolating and burying 
radioactive wastes in Ukraine's geologic formations have been 
discussed many times in recent years at inter-departmental 
meetings of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, the State 
Committee on Geology, the Education Ministry, and also 
specialists from the DKVYaE, the Nuclear Energy Inspectorate, 
and the Enerhoproekt [Energy Planning and Designing] Institute. 
In March 1993 the problem was discussed at a conference of the 
Ukraine Supreme Council Commissionon on Higher Education and 
Science, which confirmed the need for integrated research and 
the formulation of an appropriate state program. 
  Now that program has been formulated, and these are its 
stages: 
  I (1993-1995). Formulation of the conceptual 
principles and allocation of promising areas for reconnaisance 
work and selection of test sites. 
  II (1996-2004). Study of regional, zonal, and 
local conditions; forecasting of the consequences of the 
construction and operation of underground radioactive waste 
isolation facilities. 
  III (2005-2010). Preparation of the construction 
and experimental operation of facilities. 
  [Correspondent] What do you think of the possibility of 
using 
nuclear blasts to make such storage places? 
  [Khrushchov] At first I was tempted to try it. It would be 
so 
convenient--bang, and there's your facility. After detailed 
study, however, we decided the explosions would cause fissures, 
so we had to look for other ways. And we found them. 
  [Correspondent] We've been talking about AES wastes. How 
about other kinds, for example military wastes? 
  [Khrushchov] I don't actually know how things stand. I do 
know about the burial of military wastes in salt mines in the 
U.S., but I haven't had contacts with our own military. 
  [Correspondent] Can the same methods be used in burying 
toxic 
wastes? 
  [Khrushchov] The situation is more complex. Radioactive 
wastes do eventually cease being radioactive, but toxic wastes 
never do. I'm worried by the way some nonprofessionals try to 
solve these problems at one stroke. We need to make a sound 
choice between two approaches--processing and storage. Recently 
I was visited by colleagues from Russia who are developing a 
variant of toxic waste burial in the potassium mines of the 
Pre-Urals. Their concept is not bad, but I did criticize some 
approaches. 
  [Correspondent] A final question. What do you think of the 
idea of burial sites where the area is already contaminated--the 
30-kilometer zone? 
  [Khrushchov] No way! It's foolhardy. Ideas like that stem 
from ignorance of geological conditions. We can only talk of 
burying low- and medium-radioactive wastes. We need to consult 
with scientists in order to avoid mistakes!

  [Text] But how are we to store wastes until the program is 
in place? According to KOMMERSANT UKRAINY, Ukraine's 
Derzhkomatom [State Atomic Committee] has placed an order with 
Azovmash Concern (Mariupol) for special containers for temporary 
storage of spent nuclear fuel. 
  From 1978 through 1989, Azovmash made 41 containers to 
transport spent fuel (starting in 1989, production was stopped 
owing to a lack of orders). These containers were the basis for 
a model to store spent fuel, TK-13. 
  As an alternative, a program is being worked out to have the 
same combine manufacture Castor WWR-1000 containers using 
Germany's Nukem technology. According to Azovmash's people, 
implementing the program will take 3.77 billion karbovantsy and 
17.9 million German marks. TK-13 will "consume" 13 billion 
karbovantsy and 19.5 million U.S. dollars. The production of 
Castor containers may start in 1995; TK-13 may start in 1998. 
The service life of the former is 50 years; the latter's is five 
years. 
  A special Derzhkomatom appraisal commission is looking at 
both proposals. Which will it choose?

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko, under the rubric "In the </F>
Parties and Movements": "Where the Ukrainian Party Ark, in Which 
Everyone from the Neo-Bolsheviks to the Neo-Nazis Has Gathered, 
Will Float"] 
  [Text] Already on the eve of the parliamentary elections it 
is possible to state that despite the talk about "party-phobia" 
among the broad masses, there are no fewer political parties or 
public organizations and associations which they form for 
participation in elections. What is more, these formations can 
be classified according to the methodology adopted throughout 
the world with the traditional "leftist," "center," and 
"rightist" segments and separated by pure party political 
programs. In other words, Ukraine has seen the end of that 
"distorted mirror" of party life from the days of the struggle 
against the Communist Party monopoly when it, as the bearer of 
public regression and totalitarianism, was not "leftist," as 
everywhere else in the world, but "rightist." And the 
traditional "rightists" on the planet--the nationalists, 
national radicals, and so on--under our conditions were 
"leftists," because they fought against political tyranny and 
defended the right of peoples to state self-determination. 
  Today, according to the studies of the Institute of 
Strategic 
Research (ISI), we have "leftists"--the socialist-communist 
orientation--and "rightists"--the nationalist and radical 
national formations, plus the two-part "center," which unites 
(and this is a unique feature of post-Soviet Ukraine) the 
national democrats and pragmatic centrists (see the schematic 
chart--author). In the opinion of the ISI, there are five 
criteria on which this division is based, specifically attitudes 
toward: (1) the idea of state independence; (2) the historical 
period when Ukraine was a part of Russia and the USSR; (3) 
present-day Russia and the CIS themselves; (4) the form of state 
order, organization of power, and political regime in Ukraine; 
(5) the purposes, forms, and methods of conducting market 
reforms. To the last point I would add that the associations of 
citizens are also divided into center, leftist and rightist 
extremes by their methods of achieving their goals 
(revolutionary or evolutionary). 
  So, apologizing for the lengthy enumeration, I will try to 
present all those who, as in Noah's ark, exist in Ukraine today 
and will be struggling for deputy seats. The socialist-communist 
complex: the Socialist (SPU) and Communist (KPU) parties and the 
public organizations Union of Communists of Ukraine (SKU) and 
Front of Laborers of Ukraine (FTU). This also includes the many 
regional and republic associations such as Laboring Ukraine, the 
All-Ukrainian Communist Party of Bolsheviks, and others. These 
parties call for effective social guarantees and closer, 
all-encompassing integration into the CIS, oppose rapid market 
reforms, and so on. 
  The centrist-pragmatists include the Party of Democratic 
Rebirth (PDVU), the People's Party (NPU), the Liberal Party 
(LPU), the Social Democratic Party (SPDU), the Peasant Party 
(KresPU), the Ukrainian Party of Beer Lovers (UPLP), the Party 
of Labor (PT), the Ukrainian Party of Justice (UPS), the Party 
of Economic Rebirth of the Crimea (PEVK), the Constitutional 
Democratic Party (KDPU), the Civil Consent Centrist Party 
(PTsGS), the Party of National Salvation (PNSU), the Civil 
Congress (GKU), the All-Ukrainian Gromada [Community] 
Association [VOG], the Ukrainian Party of Solidarity and Social 
Justice (UPSSS), the Labor Congress (TKU), the Party of Slavic 
Unity (PSYeU), and the New Ukraine Association (NU). These 
formations put liberal or socially adjusted market reforms, 
private property, democracy, individual freedom and its priority 
over the state, and the like above everything else. They often 
arose as regional lobbies and associations based on the 
interests of particular groups of politicians or social strata. 
  The national democrats, who defend the priority of democracy 
(but with a national slant) and more rapid establishment of 
Ukrainian statehood include: the Ukrainian Republican Party 
(URP), the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party (UKDP), the 
Democratic Party (DemPU), the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPU), 
the Christian Democratic Party (KhDPU), the Greens Party (PZU), 
the People's Movement [Narodnyy Rukh--NRU), the Party of Free 
Peasants (PSKU), and these public organizations: the Congress of 
National Democratic Forces (KTsDS) and the All-Ukrainian Public 
Organization "All-People's Movement of Ukraine" ["Vsenarodnyy 
Rukh Ukrainy"--VNRU). 
  The national radicals are represented by the Ukrainian 
Conservative Party (UKRP), the Ukrainian National Conservative 
Party (UNKP), the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN), the 
All-Ukrainian Political Association "State Independence of 
Ukraine" (GSU), the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in 
Ukraine (OUNiU), and the public associations: Ukrainian National 
Assembly (UNA) and Ukrainian National Self-Defense (UNS). They 
fight for building a Ukrainian state at any price, including at 
the price of democracy. 
  The ISI believes that the stability and balance of the 
pragmatic centrists make them attractive in the eyes of the 
ordinary citizen and rank-and-file voter which, for one, makes a 
victory of the "center" entirely likely. For two, the 
pragmatists will take over the "center", either pushing the 
national democrats toward the "rightists" or making them more 
pragmatic in their political aspirations. In this situation a 
person cannot help but wonder if the pragmatists, who are likely 
to win the election, will be able to move from an attractive 
presentation of their moderate programs to an equally attractive 
and effective implementation of them in reality. And would it be 
for the general welfare, which we very much want.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Danylovych Dumanskyy, head of the </F>
Laboratory of Environmental Electromagnetic Factors: "Radar 
Stations Are Especially Dangerous to Children"; time and place 
not given] 
  [Text] In our special "Land of Khaki" edition we 
described how the Greens blocked the construction of a 
superpowerful radar station. Reactions to the Greens' success 
varied, including "We've found someone to fight--and it's not 
nuclear power plants; they pose no danger." "The Greens are only 
hurting Ukraine's defense." To get to the bottom of things we 
had our correspondent interview Professor Yuriy Danylovych 
Dumanskyy, head of the Laboratory of Environmental 
Electromagnetic Factors, Ukrainian Scientific-Hygienic 
Center. 
  [Correspondent] Professor, do radar stations really pose a 
danger to health? 
  [Dumanskyy] Radar stations are a big source of environmental 
radiation, producing superhigh-frequency electromagnetic fields. 
An electromagnetic field is very damaging to living organisms. 
In human beings, for example, the central nervous system suffers 
(memory is impaired and reactions slow down). It is especially 
harmful to children, as we know from studies in Odessa. At high 
levels a person suffers from headaches, fatigue, and 
nervousness. Men's potency is reduced and women's menstrual 
cycle is disrupted. The effect of the exposure accumulates, but 
if it stops, the person recovers and the complaints stop. 
Especially high levels (more than 10 milliwats per square 
centimeter) cause clouding of the eye lens, the heat effect, and 
hallucinations. Plant tissues die and, at high levels, burn. 
  [Correspondent] Is anybody watching over people's safety in 
that regard? 
  [Dumanskyy] Hygienic normatives have been worked out to 
ensure safe conditions for people living in the vicinity of 
radar stations. On their basis the Health Ministry issued a 
number of requirements to radar station owners involving 
relocation, and certification of these units is underway. 
However, responses to the requirements have been slow. For 
example, the Defense Ministry pleads lack of funds. Moreover, 
not all units are covered yet--for example, over-the-horizon 
stations. 
  [Correspondent] Who are the owners, and where are the units 
located? 
  [Dumanskyy] Primarily the Defense Ministry, which has 
guidance stations, superpowerful space observation antennas, and 
PTO [technical service point] stations. The rest are divided 
into long-range and high-range (which are especially dangerous 
because their rays often "cling" to the earth). Radar stations 
are also used in civil aviation, maritime operations, and the 
weather service. 
  Radar stations are located in population centers or (more 
often) not far away. As a result, worrisome situations have 
developed in Lvov, Mukachevo, Ivano-Frankovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, 
Nikolayev, Odessa, Yevpatoriya, and Kiev. In Sevastopol the 
field is so strong that in some places it makes neon lights go 
on. 
  [Correspondent] What is to be done? 
  [Dumanskyy] Measures to prevent harmful effects of radar 
stations include 1) Moving stations outside of populated areas; 
2) Resettling the inhabitants; 3) Changing the stations' 
operating modes; 4) Changing the angle of radiation; 5) Setting 
up restricted radiation zones; 6) Planting woods; 7) Raising the 
station above the locality; 8) Protective structures (banks, 
fences, dikes, and so on.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Vlad: "Ukraine's Already Receiving </F>
Ultimatums"] 
  [Text] The board of the State Committee for Oil and Gas, 
which held a meeting in Kiev last week, in a sense recalled a 
mirror reflecting our economy from within. Disheveled, with its 
pockets turned inside out. 
  This time the economy was speaking through the voice of 
Valentin Kolomiyev, acting chairman of the Ukrgaz Production 
Association. Consider for example the following: Last year the 
production association purchased gas in Russia valued at 2 
trillion Russian rubles, but it paid for 466 billion, including 
166 billion on Russian technical credit. In the meantime every 
kopeck of the R1.2 billion obtained for transit handling of gas 
across Ukrainian territory was used to reduce the price of 
natural gas in the domestic market. Up until May inclusively, as 
an example, Ukrgaz purchased a thousand cubic meters at a cost 
of 15,600 in the karbovanets equivalent, while selling it to 
consumers at 6,810 karbovantsy. It was in this way that the debt 
was multiplied and the prices of products of chemical, 
metallurgical and other sectors of the national economy, which 
are already becoming noncompetitive in the foreign market, were 
regulated. First one prime minister and then another told us 
that there was nothing to fear; still, the socioeconomic 
situation is being monitored, though industry is not striking. 
  It became clear as early as at the beginning of this year 
that a strike is not necessary for a work stoppage to occur. 
Price inflation has become the cause of financial paralysis. 
  But we are reassured once again: There is nothing to fear, 
such a financial crisis can be seen in other states of the 
former Union as well. You're trying to pull the wool over our 
eyes, folks, because there's nothing in common between these two 
cases. It was revealed at this same meeting of the board of the 
State Committee for Oil and Gas that an ultimatum was in fact 
sent to acting Prime Minister Ye. Zvyagilskiy in a telegram from 
Turkmenistan. It threatened cessation of natural gas deliveries 
to Ukraine as of 21 February if it continues to evade payment of 
its debts for last year and this year. Last year's debt is not 
less than $500 million U.S., while this year's debt consists of 
penalties for late payments, as per the signed contract. 
  In the words of V. Kolomiyev, in January his department 
should have paid $284 million for gas. But where was he to get 
the money? The $18.4 million obtained through the stock exchange 
and tender committee were only enough to pay the penalties for 1 
month. In other words Ukraine is reaping its harvest from the 
fields of currency regulation: What you sow is what you reap. 
And the wretchedness of the currency harvest, which is something 
we need for foreign economic activity, distinguishes our 
financial crisis from the others. 
  A hastily created government commission took on the task of 
leading the industry out of its crisis of payments, while Yefim 
Leonidovich Zvyagilskiy was tasked to settle things with 
Turkmenistan. This by the way will not have any effect on the 
cost of gas this year. If it does grow more expensive, it will 
do so only insignificantly. And the Ukrgaz Production 
Association probably shouldn't count on the enterprises 
immediately fulfilling government decree No 23 on settling 
natural gas accounts in hard currency and Russian rubles. It 
seems as if the Ministry of the Economy feels that cheap gas 
means an inexpensive life, but it has no idea of what a cheap 
policy can bring. 
  By the way, Turkmenistan's ultimatum carried the threat that 
a contract with Ukraine for 28 billion cubic meters would be 
broken. Ukraine naturally isn't pleased. And as it became known, 
it sat down at the negotiating table with Turkmenistan, offering 
to pay its debt off with wheat. But it is now understood even by 
people who aren't economists that there will never be enough 
wheat to pay off the debts. What we need to do is improve the 
system of currency regulation, and the loan and financial 
policy. It appears that the National Bank, which offered to 
employ market distribution of credit resources and hard currency 
this week, was the first to realize this. And it promised 
creditors a new weapon with which to fight debtors--the 
promissory note.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lvov Railroad Chief Heorhiy Kirpa by </F>
Mykhaylo Vasylashko (Lvov-Ternopol-Khmelnitskiy): "The Problems 
Are Ours; Is the Purse Moscow's?"; date and place not given] 
  [Text] Anyone who travels often by rail has probably 
noticed improvements in passenger service on the Lvov Railroad's 
excellent trains. People started talking about service in Lvov 
when seasoned railroader Heorhiy Kirpa became chief of the 
railroad half a year ago. 
  Heorhiy Mykolayovych set about finding solutions to problems 
of passenger transport. But they can't be solved on the level of 
one railroad. The financial crisis is a killer. Russia alone 
owes the Lvov Line 32 billion rubles, 8 million Swiss Francs, 
and 2.5 million U.S. dollars for passenger transport. Then there 
are the debtors at home. For example, the Prydniprovsk Railroad 
owes 290 billion Ukrainian rubles. 
  [Vasylashko] How did this happen? 
  [Kirpa] You'll recall what Lenin did first to create the 
Soviet State. He took over the post office, the telegraph, and 
the train stations. And any new regime in the world has first 
taken over these key structures. Our own Ukraine has told the 
world that it is independent, yet it has not yet taken over the 
republic's railroads. Strange as it seems, we still do not have 
a law on railroad transport, no haulage regulations, statutes 
and other legal acts. 
  The Transport Ministry, Ukrzaliznytsya [Ukraine Railroad], 
has existed for two years, and we have been waiting for answers 
to many questions. Yet the economic situation, especially, is 
getting worse. Our biggest trouble is that Ukrzaliznytsya has 
failed to formulate its own legal status on centralized 
payments, has not detached Ukraine's six railroads from the old 
Moscow payment system, and has not set up its own center, which 
it should and could have done. Worse, last May Kiev asked Moscow 
to continue the payments. I chanced to ask about that in 
Russia's Railway Ministry, where I had gone to deal with 
problems of debt payment. 
  So much for our sovereignty. We run some kind of operation, 
and our neighbor figures our money on the Big Brother principle. 
Maybe he pays something if he feels like it. Of the 32 billion 
[rubles], the Lvov people have received two billion, and the oil 
products haven't been delivered either. Well, it's not 
surprising: Ukrzaliznytsya isn't even able to exercise internal 
control of payments, institute centralized fund accumulation, 
and so on. In short, there is a Ministry but no full-scale, 
planned state operation. It's no surprise, then, that something 
bad is happening--something like a bazaar--on the railroads, 
where discipline and order used to be so good. Conductors take 
as much as they can from passengers, cashiers sell tickets 
through fictitious persons. 
  Not only that, but even locomotive engineers are hauling 
passengers now. I found out about it because of an accident in 
which a passenger in a locomotive was injured by high voltage. 
In fact, it's hard to name a single sphere where people aren't 
trying to do biznes. It's the result of our economic 
policy. Certainly we're doing our best to prevent such 
violations. We are reorganizing the auditing system and 
automating ticket sales so there won't be empty seats permitting 
train masters to sell tickets on the train. But to restore order 
we have to fight the causes, not the results. And that, I think, 
is the state's department. 
  The Lvov railroaders are doing what they can to correct the 
situation. For shunting operations they have taken more than 30 
"revolution-era" steam engines out of mothballs and saved 
considerable fuel and oil. 
  [Vasylashko] But isn't it true, Heorhiy Mykolayovych, that 
the railroaders have gone so far as to engage in proletarian 
expropriation of fuel and oil--for example the recent case in 
Ternopol? 
  [Kirpa] Railroad transport is the only sector that isn't yet 
paralyzed today. Since the state has given all appropriations to 
the oil biznes--i.e. the Mafia--and we no longer get 
anything on a centralized basis, there's a real danger that the 
railroads will shut down, which means economic collapse. It's 
out of concern for the state that we have to take such unpopular 
steps. And we're retrieving money with those commercial prices. 
Starting last October I overpaid the businessmen by 25 percent; 
today it's 150 percent. I talked about that huge snag when I met 
with Zvyahilskyy. Energy ought to be in the state's hands. Right 
now the Mafia is cheating the state. Often, an oil tank car that 
has just crossed the border will return to Ukraine, this time to 
be re-directed somewhere to the south. What would you do in that 
case? Stop the passenger trains? It's impossible, because 
passenger traffic has almost doubled. Last year alone we 
dispatched an additional 178 trains, and even that's not enough. 
The railcar fleet is inadequate. We haven't had a car replaced 
in two years. 
  Let's say we expect no favors from Kiev. We have already 
made 
a deal with the Northern Railroad to repair cars in Kovel, and 
they will buy new ones with the money they make. That's how much 
trouble railroaders all over Western Ukraine are in. Although 
frankly, they're in somewhat better shape than other regions. 
Anyway, without a state program they can't get out of the 
crisis. And the Ministry and its leaders today have shown 
themselves to be incompetent. After all, what kind of proprietor 
is it that works and his neighbor counts his money? In such 
circumstances, it is time for either the President or the 
Supreme Council to undertake to nationalize the railroads. 
Otherwise, we'll lose everything with the railroads and be 
buried under the wreckage of sovereign Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Skachko under the rubric "Point of </F>
View": "They Have Started Over, Apparently, With More Success"] 
  [Text] Since there has been no official interpretation, we 
should recall, in an elementary manner, the texts of documents 
concerning the problem under examination in order to figure out 
what kind of decree our Supreme Council adopted on 3 February of 
this year and in order to try to analyze the consequences of 
this step for all: the text of the decree of 3 February itself, 
the text of the Supreme Council decree on the ratification of 
the START-1 treaty, dated 18 November 1993, and Article V of the 
Lisbon Protocol to the START-1 treaty, dated 28 May 1992. It is 
this particular sequence of documents that is important, no 
matter what chronological view we take. So, let us have 
everything in order: As the 3 February decree says, it cancels 
reservations concerning the article of the Lisbon Protocol which 
are found in the decree of the Supreme Council dated 18 November 
1993. We look at this document and find that the article 
mentioned is referred to only in its reservation 3: "Ukraine 
does not consider Article V of the Lisbon Protocol binding on 
it." This is all. However, 12 more reservations remain! The 
article of the protocol itself says that Ukraine must join the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (DNYaZ) as a nonnuclear state. 
  So, how does it look? Last November our deputies disagreed 
with the Lisbon wording of the status of Ukraine and made 
reservations that would guarantee to Ukraine its true status as 
the owner of the nuclear weapons that have ended up on its 
territory, national security, and fair compensation for nuclear 
disarmament which is beyond the resources of our economy. In the 
process, the START-1 treaty was ratified, but neither the United 
States nor Russia recognized this fact because of the 
parliamentary reservations. 
  In keeping with reservation 11 of 18 November, President L. 
Kravchuk began negotiation efforts, and the trilateral statement 
of 14 January 1994 appeared. If for no other reason, this 
document was interesting, to put it mildly, because nothing was 
given or guaranteed to Ukraine, but almost everything that the 
reservations of the parliament called for was promised. So, by 
adopting the 3 February decree, the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
actually responded to a promise of guarantees and assistance 
with a promise-consent to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty as a nonnuclear state. It ended up being a promise by 
Washington and Moscow in exchange for a promise by Kiev because, 
first, Article V of the Lisbon Protocol does not provide for 
Ukraine joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty urgently and 
automatically. Second, the preamble to the decree of 3 February 
says that Ukraine is the owner of the components of nuclear 
weapons on its territory (see the ninth paragraph of the decree: 
This is our status as viewed by Ukraine). Third, I repeat, 
another 12 reservations remain in the November decree which call 
for the signing of at least 10 state-to-state agreements and 
other documents. They are supposed to regulate the problems of 
international guarantees of the national security of Ukraine, 
economic, scientific-technical, and financial assistance in the 
process of nuclear disarmament, manufacturer warranty servicing 
of Ukrainian missiles by Russian specialists, a review of 
conditions and financing for inspection efforts, opportunities 
to use launch silos for peaceful purposes, conditions for the 
use of weapons materials from the liquidated nuclear weapons, 
and compensation for them. The issues of compensation for 
tactical nuclear weapons, the schedule for transferring 
strategic missiles to Russia, conditions for this process, 
control over dismantling, and so on are to be coordinated 
separately. In a word, everything is envisioned that our 
government was obligated to do in Point 2 of the decree of 3 
February. Only after these conditions are met will Ukraine be 
prepared to get rid of nuclear weapons and join the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear country with an easy 
heart. 
  So, it is already possible to say that by agreeing to join 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine has now confronted the United States and Russia with a 
choice of either failing to listen to Ukrainian demands in the 
future, too, and bringing pressure to bear on Ukraine, pursuing 
a policy of double standards in view of an indulgent attitude 
toward the so-called "threshold" states which are prepared to 
acquire nuclear weapons; or concluding the agreements envisioned 
in the January trilateral statement as soon as possible and 
satisfying everyone. At any rate, our parliament, with 
astonishing success, has let everybody understand this: If you 
help Ukraine you will win; if you bring it to its knees, you 
will win, too, but it could be a pyrrhic victory. This may be 
the greatest achievement of our parliament in the foreign arena 
on 3 February. 
  There also were domestic achievements, because the Supreme 
Council seriously dimmed the halo of the president as the only 
supporter of nuclear disarmament in the Ukrainian ruling elite, 
testified yet again that all branches of power are to blame for 
the critical condition of the Ukrainian state, and obligated 
executive power headed by the president to sign advantageous 
agreements on the issues of nuclear disarmament, which it put 
under strict parliamentary control. At present, the "more 
compliant" president and the "noncompliant" Supreme Council are 
together. However, the mutual relations between the two branches 
of power are another topic....

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Drach, chairman of Ukrainian World </F>
Coordinating Council: "Ukraine and Russia: Prospects for 
Interrelations"] 
  [Text] Two years after the official disappearance of the 
unforgettable Soviet Union, dialogue by intellectuals with a 
highly developed sense of responsibility to their nations and 
peoples--Ukraine, Russia, and the CIS countries--is the same 
kind of global necessity as the earlier process of detente 
between the two world ideological camps that prevented nuclear 
war between the United States and the USSR. This applies in 
particular to representatives of Russia and Ukraine. 
  My choice of the common and--as history 
demonstrated--productive term "detente" is deliberate. Just as 
all mankind was on the verge of the apocalypse for a long time 
during the cold war years, now the Russian and Ukrainian people 
have been driven to the point of suicide and are being urged to 
take the fatal step, and if the blockheads endowed with 
political and spiritual authority manage to cross this line, 
only the blind, deaf, and mute can expect this to remain a 
regional conflict, like those tormenting the Caucasus, Central 
Asia, and Moldova. The whole explanation can be found in the 
single word "Chernobyl." 
  The main prerequisites for this dialogue, which will be 
truly 
pivotal for all of us, are sincerity, honesty, and goodwill. We 
will leave the propagandistic intimidation and nerve-gas methods 
to the honored veterans of psychological warfare against 
decadent capitalism and their highly enlightened disciples, who 
did not manage to achieve worldwide fame before 24 August 1991 
and are now selling their erudition to the same warring parties 
within the boundaries of yesterday's empire. You and I cannot 
immediately pacify Ostankino or the chauvinistic newspapers and 
other mouthpieces of the warmongers, who are now calling for 
Russo-Ukrainian war instead of world war and are certain to 
engender equally radical forces of armed resistance in Ukraine. 
You and I, even if we were able to find a common language right 
away, could not quickly bring the hard-nosed experts back to 
their senses, not to mention the excessively passionate and 
belligerent deputies who already see the expanses to the north 
and south of the town of Mikhaylovskoye as a theater of military 
operations. Nevertheless, just as common sense once began 
building bridges, quietly and imperceptibly, across the abyss 
between East and West to the accompaniment of the usual 
propaganda crossfire and volleys, now we must begin laying the 
foundation for the normal, just, peaceful, and mutually 
beneficial coexistence of the Russian and Ukrainian people, 
which will be just as essential to the survival of all of us 
within the territory of the former USSR as the mutual 
understanding between Moscow and Washington was essential to 
global detente in the recent past. That is why I would define 
Russo-Ukrainian relations as the decisive factor at this time. I 
am not an economist, political scientist, or diplomat, but I am 
certain that the deep inner feelings of the nation, or at least 
of its ruling elite--feelings that might be described as its 
emotional state--are making their way into these specific 
spheres and are influencing each of these spheres in their own 
way. It is the state of our emotions, as the primary factor in 
Russo-Ukrainian relations, that I will be discussing. 
  I do not want each of my theses to be taken solely as an 
indictment of the other side or an insult to anyone's 
self-esteem, or to be interpreted as a final and inflexible 
position brooking no evolution or reconsideration. I think that 
we are all ready to regard the expression of a different point 
of view, even an opposite one, not as the erection of 
fortifications for attack or defense or for the seizure of 
commanding heights and bridgeheads, but as the removal of 
existing obstacles and barriers impeding fraternization. 
  Here are a few of the theses aimed at this kind of mutual 
understanding. 
  The first thesis is that we Ukrainians have to understand 
the 
Russians, who grew accustomed to calling themselves nothing less 
than Great Russians for a century or two. Actually, it makes no 
difference whether they had good reason to call themselves this 
or were mere pretenders. The meaning with which they invested 
this title is also unimportant. We simply have to realize that 
Russia did show the world its potential for large-scale, and 
even global expansionism for several centuries, until it had 
completely exhausted itself and the nations it had conquered and 
was forced to retreat from all continents, back to the borders 
of the enfeebled empire, under the pressure of the 
unquestionably stronger force of the rest of mankind, the world 
community, and not just the West. 
  We are firmly convinced that Russia will never be an empire 
again: Anything else would contradict all of the known natural 
tendencies in the progression of historical events and the 
biographies of all empires. We are not capable, however, of 
communicating this knowledge to not only the Russian hawks and 
eagles, not only the Russian super-nationalist crusaders, but 
even the average Russian--yesterday's Great Russian. 
Furthermore, our references to this obvious historical fact 
might only complicate the Russians' own acknowledgement of this 
fact. Sooner or later the Russians will realize this themselves: 
In the final analysis, there has never been a nation that 
completely lost its ability to judge its own behavior accurately 
and change it in response to cardinal changes in the basic 
circumstances of its existence. We have to be patient, tactful, 
considerate, and kind. We also have to be active participants in 
dialogue, however, because we are fated to be neighbors. Our 
activities have to take the form of confessions rather than 
sermons. We have to teach the Russians as much as we can about 
ourselves instead of telling them about themselves. Regrettably, 
they know virtually nothing about the Ukrainian soul, although 
they have always called their own soul enigmatic, and they still 
believe this. It is possible that we also do not know everything 
about ourselves, but it would be useful to inform the Russians 
now and then that the Ukrainians will never accept the myth of 
the "thousand-year Russian state"--the myth that the Ukrainians 
are not a nation, that the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev can 
belong to the state-controlled Moscow Church forever, and that 
our 700-year struggle for the restoration of our own state has 
been the result of the whims of nationalists, who for some 
reason have passed their ideas down to each new generation, no 
matter how much they have been violated and eradicated by all 
barbarous and "civilized" methods. This is not an invocation: 
These are the facts of Ukrainian history, which became, 
regrettably, the facts of Russian history as well. 
  I will not mention the fact that half of the Ukrainian 
nationality was exterminated by Moscow during just the Soviet 
period: Convincing proof of this was presented at the recent 
"Famine-33" international science conference in Kiev. We invite 
thinking Russians to take a closer look at the tendencies in the 
development of Ukrainian-Russian coexistence, and not just 
Russia's present superiority in terms of brute military force 
and economic strength. The Ukrainophobes are right: 90 percent 
of the feelings expressed on 1 December 1991 were signs of 
Khmelnitskiy-ism, Mazepa-ism, Petlyura-ism, and Bandera-ism (I 
am deliberately using these Russian ideological cliches). This 
means that in spite of all defeats and retreats, the will of 
Ukrainians to establish themselves as a nation on the land of 
their thousand-year-old ancestors will never be broken. It will 
be extinguished only when the last Ukrainian dies. The new 
Russian leaders' encouragement of our people to achieve this 
goal will obviously depend on the consequences they foresee for 
the Russian people. The historical precedents of the Aztecs, the 
Mayans, the North American Indians, the Australian Aborigines, 
or Russia's own Northern nationalities belong to other times and 
other states of human civilization and should not concern even 
the patriots of the old Russia. These mass sacrifices of some 
ethnic groups on the altars of others can no longer serve as an 
alibi for today's champions of old traditions. Furthermore, the 
Ukrainian nationality is a special case: No one could destroy it 
even in the 750 years it had to live without a state of its own, 
even in the brutal barbarian ages. A holocaust against the 
Ukrainian nationality is not a realistic or predictable stage of 
Russian history. Just look at how the body of Russia is already 
being devoured by Moscow's ancien-regime reaction to the 
attitudes of Tatarstan or Chechnya, turning healthy processes in 
these regions into dangerously unhealthy ones. 
  Even the general public in Ukraine has heard of some of the 
analytical recommendations Russian strategists have made with 
regard to policy toward Ukraine: The memorable notes of Vladimir 
Lukin are a good example. It is clear that these were only 
fragments, metaphorically speaking, of something like a Russian 
"Barbarossa Plan" for Ukraine, the rough draft of an Anschluss. 
We have to let the Russian politicians and experts know that, in 
spite of all their secret codes, hostile intentions of this kind 
cannot fail to evoke the appropriate reaction in the Ukrainian 
mind. Even if these official and unofficial Russian state 
secrets were to be guarded more closely than they are today, 
Russia's political practice of weakening and eradicating 
Ukrainian independence in every way possible is sowing the seeds 
of resentment in the souls of millions of citizens and 
demoralizing millions of Russians. 
  Ukraine is defending itself. It is not doing this to the 
fullest extent yet, but I simply want to point out the fact that 
anyone defending his honor and dignity and his right to exist is 
always in a position of moral superiority to those who infringe 
them. These feelings are familiar to the Russians themselves, 
and they were instrumental in shaping their patriotism--from the 
battles of Kulikovo and Lake Chudskoye to those of Borodino and 
Stalingrad. Perhaps this simple reminder will help them 
understand the contemporary origins of Ukrainian patriotism. 
  Here is the second thesis: The Russians might be interested 
in knowing that foreigners regard the Kremlin dreamers' emphasis 
on the so-called Russian-speaking population as a disastrous 
form of self-deception. They see it as an unscientific and 
adventuristic notion--and, consequently, as just another utopia. 
This can be judged from the heightened activity of the Ukrainian 
communities in Russia and other CIS countries, representatives 
of which are in frequent contact with us. We are not encouraging 
our fellow-countrymen from nearby foreign countries to remember 
the shocking recent horrors of their de-Ukrainization and the 
disdain for all of their human rights and liberties as long as 
they had the courage to remain Ukrainian. The elements of 
apartheid and national segregation that were used against them 
are common knowledge. I simply want to say something about the 
ineradicable features of national identity, and not only in the 
Ukrainians: Canadians do not cease to be Canadian, regardless of 
whether they speak French or English. Africans or Indians do not 
become French or English simply on linguistic grounds. The 
imaginary successes of Russophile propaganda--in east Ukraine, 
for example--are transparent when they have to serve as the 
basis for the strategy of the territorial segmentation of our 
state along linguistic lines. In short, I am advising 
consideration of the effects of today's actions on Ukraine and 
on Russia. All of us are aware of the value of the euphoria of 
public rallies and the speed with which these attitudes can 
change, and we are also aware, on the other hand, of the staying 
power of the fundamental qualities and characteristics of ethnic 
communities. In view of the fact that the Ukrainian-Russians 
already Russified the northern principalities and now have no 
intention whatsoever of Ukrainizing Russia, we have the right 
and obligation to let everyone know that Russia will never 
conquer Ukraine. It will only defeat itself by arousing 
Ukrainian resistance. This is something we do not want. 
  We can and must discuss some of the other illusions that are 
engendered, like nightmares, when the intellect is dozing. We 
can and must speak of the political games that are being played 
with the various "zones"--economic, informational, etc.--that 
are compounding hypocrisy and fraud and, consequently, their own 
futility. This applies to the efforts to disguise expansionism 
first as internationalism, then as integration, and then as 
other developments described in "Latin" terms, with which they 
are unpatriotically violating the great Russian language, 
because it obviously does not contain enough insidious 
euphemisms. My third thesis is that we must not confine 
ourselves to phantom-terms in the hope of deceiving one another. 
People usually fall prey to the very mythology they invent for 
export. One of the latest examples of this was the global 
self-deception and self-blinding of the omnipotent CPSU. 
  Here is my last thesis: There is still time to stop the 
Russo-Ukrainian arms race, still time to begin mutual 
psychological, political, and every other kind of disarmament. 
We realize that thousands of qualified experts on Nicaragua, 
Cuba, Angola, and Afghanistan are now unoccupied in Moscow's 
many institutes, and they have a strong subjective wish to 
exonerate themselves for the failures on all continents by 
turning their attention to their fraternal neighbors. But would 
it not be better to put the rich organizational, procedural, 
diplomatic, and other experience Moscow accumulated in the talks 
with Washington to good use along the Moscow-Kiev axis? After 
all, it is unlikely that any of us can find a reasonable 
explanation for today's absolutely unanticipated reversal: The 
new Russia is cultivating a sincere friendship with America and 
is constantly fighting with Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by Myroslav Levytskyy: "Kiev's Optimists!? A </F>
Political Commentary"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] 
  Official Kiev's optimism manifested itself in yet another 
aspect. In the leading circles of the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
a RESPUBLIKA correspondent was informed that the question of 
Ukraine's becoming a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty (DNYaZ) would not be taken up by the Ukrainian parliament 
in the immediate future. Consideration of this question has to 
be postponed until such time as Ukraine is accorded specific 
security guarantees. Would this take place any more rapidly than 
the dismantling of our technically obsolete missiles? 
  The president of Ukraine has also said already that this 
question will not be brought up for consideration by the present 
parliament. He did not, however, indicate the reasons why this 
was being postponed. 
  Could it be that the United States, changing its attitude 
toward Ukraine, has come to understand that the retention of 
nuclear warheads and the ratification of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty constitutes a logical and political 
absurdity? However, there is little hope of such a change in 
attitude. During the telephone conversation which took place 
between the presidents of Ukraine and the United States on 18 
February Clinton again insisted upon Ukraine's becoming a party 
to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  But what then about the promises of security guarantees? Is 
anybody in a hurry to accord them to Ukraine? All the more so 
when it would involve making uniquivocal moves in international 
policy? It was important for Ukraine to be made a part of the 
program entitled "Partnership for Peace": this was a display of 
trust in Ukraine on the part of the NATO members. As a member of 
this partnership, Ukraine adopted the Russian viewpoint with 
regard to the Serbian problem. Nowadays, after the withdrawal of 
Serbian troops from the frontline, it is still too early to 
assess the correctness or incorrectness of the Ukrainian stance 
on this matter. The Russian peace initiatives and actions in 
Abkhazia ended with the drama of the Georgian state. Ukrainian 
politicians are seeking answers to the question of what lies 
behind the fact that the Serbs believed only the Russians. All 
the more so in that Russia's presidential adviser--on the 
occasion of the new situation in the Balkans--made the following 
statement: "We need to be able to persuade people and know how 
to take advantage of the opportune moment." 
  In this situation Western commentators traditionally 
consider 
the Russians' diplomatic mission as a triumph, while expressing 
great surprise at the stance taken by Ukraine. The latter's 
democratic politicians have emphatically proclaimed that in 
foreign policy we must uneqivocally pose the matter as follows: 
"Either national interests or old-time sentiments!" 
  This matter has gained new urgency since the reasons for the 
"Russian diplomatic triumph" have been figured out. Situations 
sometimes occur whereby military people reveal that which the 
diplomats have striven so zealously and long to conceal. On 19 
February a certain Russian general in an interview for the 
Ostankino Televison Company said the following straight out: "If 
NATO intervenes in a sphere of influence which is not theirs, 
unforeseen consequences could result." He thereby emphatically 
asserted for the umpteenth time that the world is divided into 
zones of influence. 
  And so it turns out that the prolonged war in the Balkans is 
a consequence of the above-mentioned division. If decisiveness 
and determination had been shown, this military conflagration on 
the territory of the former Yugoslavia could have been 
extinguished long ago. When matters started to turn threatening 
for certain NATO members (Greece and Turkey), this organization 
showed firmness. Tens of thousands of victime did not constitute 
a sufficient argument to intervene in someone else's zone. 
  All this sheds new light on the question of according 
security guarantees to Ukraine. At one of his November 1993 
press conferences former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma said that 
Ukraine belongs to the Russian zone. Therefore, the doubts of 
certain Western journalists regarding the genuineness of the 
security guarantees intended for Ukraine are not groundless or 
unjustified.

<F P=106> [Interview with Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ukraine's </F>
ambassador to the Russian Federation, by Ihor Hrushko, under the 
rubric "Politics"; place and date not given: "Volodymyr 
Kryzhanivskyy: `Let Us Look for the Things That Bring Us Closer 
Together'"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Guest Seat </H5>
  At a time of historic upheavals, when traditional 
perceptions have proven false and when the "older brothers" are 
only slowly beginning to understand that their "younger 
brothers" have become their equals, it is very difficult for 
these same "older brothers" to rid themselves of deeply rooted 
stereotypes. For those who do not believe this, we offer the 
following interview given to HOLOS UKRAYINY's correspondent by 
People's Deputy Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ukraine's Ambassador 
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Russian Federation. The 
first question put to the ambassador concerned what is probably 
the most important issue of today: When will a new Friendship 
and Cooperation Treaty at last be signed to replace the old 
agreement signed back in 1990? For this document will determine 
how these two neighboring countries will live with each another 
for many years to come. 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] Ukraine is interested in signing this 
document as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we now sense a 
certain tendency on the part of the Russians to hold up the 
talks. Why? In my opinion, the reason for this is that this 
intergovernmental treaty will have to "dot all the i's" once and 
for all on certain issues that the Russian side is striving to 
hold in a "preserved" state. 
  Above all, this applies to the Crimea. Because this question 
will have to be settled in a definitive fashion. Dual 
citizenship is another issue. I might add that the latter is a 
contrived issue, despite the fact that it is being trumpeted 
very actively by Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev and other 
representatives of Russia's political circles. President N. 
Nazarbayev properly proposed introducing the concept of 
"postponed citizenship." In other words, an individual who 
leaves Kazakhstan, for example, to take up permanent residence 
in the Russian Federation becomes a Russian citizen. And 
vice-versa. A normal solution to the problem, you would think. 
But no, some people in Moscow are very much opposed to this. 
President N. Nazarbayev cited the example of the Sudeten Germans 
on the eve of the Second World War. Their rights had to be 
protected no matter what... And Czechoslovakia was the first to 
be brought to her knees. 
  [Hrushko] The declaration signed by the three presidents 
relieved the tension surrounding the nuclear weapons located in 
Ukraine. However, many analysts believe that now Russia has to 
take some concrete steps with respect to the entire package of 
agreements -- in particular, provide us with security 
guarantees. Is Moscow prepared to do so? 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] This question is still being "mulled over" 
inside the Russian Federation's presidential structures. There 
are indications of a certain unwillingness and of an attempt to 
delay matters. Even though Russia would benefit most by this. I 
believe that if it received a specific document, the Ukrainian 
parliament even in its present make-up would finally settle the 
issue of Ukraine's becoming a party to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  But so far there has been no anwer. It seems that it suits 
someone in the capital of the Russian Federation to portray 
Ukraine as recalcitrant and obstinate. 
  We see further evidence of this in the "invitation" that the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued to Ukraine's 
ambassador on 9 February. It is customary in diplomatic practice 
to summon ambassadors only in extraordinary circumstances, when 
the situation involves something very urgent. Yet when I arrived 
at the Foreign Ministry, they expressed their concern to me 
about an alleged recent increase in instances of desecration in 
Ukraine of monuments supposedly associated with Russian history. 
  [Hrushko] I have not heard of anything of this sort 
happening 
recently... 
  [Kryzhanivsky] Neither have I. They informed me of three 
incidents from the "remote past." The first had occurred in 
1991. You recall that some disgraceful signs had been posted 
near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Kiev. This was an old 
affair, possibly even one that had been masterminded by 
Kryuchkov's people. The second case dated to the same time -- 
the incident in which the memorial plaque on the N. Bulgakov 
Museum was splattered with paint. And the third, which happened 
half a year ago, was the destruction of the bust of M. Kuznetsov 
in Rivne Oblast. I regarded this act as absolutely inappropriate 
and senseless. 
  [Hrushko] What, in your opinion, was the reason for this 
diplomatic demarche? 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] One senses that it was largely a calculated 
move. Of the 25 million Russians that need to be "protected," 12 
million live in Ukraine. But to the great chagrin of some 
Russian politicians, nobody is insulting these people, nobody is 
oppressing their national feelings or their civil rights. In the 
absence of facts, it is necessary to concoct something in order 
to persuade the world that Ukraine is uncivilized. This, despite 
the fact that the Ukrainian public at large expressed strong 
indignation regarding the acts of vandalism that I described 
above. 
  [Hrushko] Another stumbling block in our bilateral relations 
is the Black Sea Fleet. 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] Yes, the problem with respect to the fleet 
is 
not an easy one. Even though this problem is not at the top of 
the agenda at this time. The Russians are in no hurry to settle 
this matter. They are obviously planning to approach it from 
different angle after the election of Yu. Meshkov. And his 
position is clear: the fleet must go to Russia. This is one side 
of the issue. On the other side, we have the Trilateral 
Declaration, a very important event that put off the resolution 
of this question for a while. 
  In my view, our defense minister, General Radetskyy, "dotted 
all the i's" very clearly. I have in mind the procedure for 
dividing up the Black Sea Fleet: first we inventory it, perhaps 
even reduce it, and then we divide it up. So far, Russia has not 
agreed to this and is biding her time. 
  [Hrushko] The problem of the fleet is closely linked with 
the 
problem of the Crimea as a whole, especially following the 
presidential election on the peninsula. Upon his return from 
Moscow, where he met with influential politicians, Yu. Meshkov 
began talking of billions and of a ruble zone... 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] He did meet with S. Shakhray, V. Shumeyko, 
and Mr. Ryurikov, the President's aide for international 
relations. I see nothing wrong in this. For example, should the 
prime minister of Tatarstan visit Kiev, let him meet with 
influential people. However, it is premature to speak of money, 
especially 50 billion for the resettlement of the Crimean 
Tatars. Yu. Meshkov expressed this request. But this is a long 
way off from actually receiving the money. The same applies to 
the ruble zone. I do not believe that Russia will agree quite so 
readily to set up an "aerodynamic pipeline" through which to 
pump out its currency. Recall the example of Kazakhstan. 
  In other words, Yu. Meshkov met with people, they got to 
know 
him, but with very little in the way of specific results for him. 
  [Hrushko] Did the Crimean president visit the Ukrainian 
Embassy? 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] No. Perhaps he waited for us to invite him, 
or, what is more likely, someone advised him not to visit us. 
Still, I eventually spoke to him over the telephone. 
Incidentally, we spoke in Ukrainian. I hope that on his next 
visit, Mr. Meshkov will visit us, recognizing that the Embassy 
of Ukraine is also his embassy. We will always be of assistance 
to the Crimea, just as we are to other regions of our country. 
[Hrushko] Do you think that we can now speak of an official 
position or policy of the Russian Federation with respect to the 
Crimea? 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] The ink has not yet dried on the signatures 
placed by the three presidents on the joint declaration. 
Consequently, the Russian side's official position is that the 
Crimea is Ukraine's internal affair. But there are influential 
people in Moscow who would very much like Ukraine to resolve the 
Crimean problem according to the principle described by Ilf and 
Petrov: "on a saucer with a blue border" [i.e., in very elegant 
fashion]. In other words, Kiev gives its approval for a 
referendum, following which Crimea becomes independent, and then 
as a subject of international law, it speaks of becoming part of 
Russia. 
  Mr. Meshkov, however, is not raising this issue. Because he 
is fully aware that this would constitute an anti-constitutional 
act directed at undermining Ukraine's territorial integrity, 
which would provoke an appropriate response from Kiev and the 
world community. 
  [Hrushko] In the era of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian 
Permanent Mission to Moscow served as channel through which the 
Kremlin's big bosses sometimes relayed instructions to their 
subjects in Kiev. Thank God, the times have changed. A 
full-fledged Ukrainian embassy has now been working in Moscow 
for more than a year. In your opinion, what are the embassy's 
principal tasks? 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] It is too early to talk of a full-fledged 
embassy. We are short of diplomats and short of housing. Of 
course, we have had some tangible accomplishments in our work. 
But we could have done a lot more if we had enough people. I am 
not talking about swelling the embassy staff. But Russia ranks 
number one in importance for us. We must therefore do everything 
in our power to ensure that the work of this embassy is 
productive. 
  With respect to tasks. Our most important task is to 
maintain 
close bilateral economic relations. Our two states need to hold 
talks constantly. It is essential for us to follow and 
understand the complex processes taking place in Russian society 
and to be able to foresee the Russian Federation's policy 
towards Ukraine. 
  And, naturally, to disseminate true, undistorted information 
about our country in Russia. We all read the Russian press and 
watch Russian television. They carry nothing but negative 
information about Ukraine. Many Russians have absolutely no idea 
what is actually happening in our country. 
  There are a great number of problems both in our country and 
in Russia; life is very hard for the people. But looking only 
for the things that divide us will lead us to nowhere. Instead, 
we should look for the best in each other, look for the things 
that bring us closer together and unite us. 
  [Hrushko] Thank you for this interview.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vasil Bykov by G. Kovalskaya; place and date </F>
not given: "Our Times Call for Shushkevich"] 
  [Text] Exclusive interview with a classical writer of 
Belarusian literature dealing with the independence of Belarus, 
chances of the People's Front and the resignation of Shushkevich. 
  There is no need to identify Vasil Bykov for the readers. 
The 
great Belarus author was known both in the former USSR as well 
as throughout the world. Not everyone, however, knows something 
else: many of the books by this author first saw the light of 
day in the Russian language (even though Bykov thinks and writes 
in Belarusian) simply because they could not be published in the 
author's homeland. Even during Soviet times ideological dictates 
and censorship that existed in Belarus were more rigid than in 
other republics. 
  It is too early to speak of freedom of creativity there at 
present as well. The trial of writer Svetlana Aleksiyevich, who 
published a book titled "The Zinc Boys" about the Afghanistan 
war, for instance, a trial which is of a distinctly political 
character, is still under way in Minsk. 
  Despite that, Vasil Bykov, an artist who has been striving 
for freedom all of his life, is not thinking of abandoning his 
native land by contrast with many of his colleagues, who, by the 
way, are not condemned by him but whose departure he regrets 
deeply. What does the author like and dislike in the Belarus of 
today? What are his political preferences? How does he visualize 
the Belarusian path into the world? 
  Our observer Galina Kovalskaya spoke with Vasil Bykov. 
  [Kovalskaya] Why is the issue concerning national 
independence of the republic of Belarus again one of the most 
hotly disputed ones? It would appear that it is an issue 
resolved a long time ago: first in September 1991, when the 
Supreme Council of the republic proclaimed independence, then at 
Belovezhskaya Pushcha, when three of the former Soviet republics 
reiterated the disintegration of the USSR with their agreement. 
  [Bykov] State sovereignty is an unambiguous term that does 
not lend itself to any kind of reinterpretation. Either it 
exists or it does not. In my opinion state independence benefits 
the people because, as indicated by historical experience, the 
welfare of the people is directly associated with the existence 
of their own state. Naturally, we are not speaking of any 
isolation from the outside world, but merely about political and 
national independence. 
  Independence came to Belarus somewhat unexpectedly. All of 
its preceding history, it would appear, prodded us in the 
opposite direction, toward full integration, first with the 
Polish state, then with the Russian empire. When it became 
necessary to ensure independence politically, economically, and 
culturally it turned out that our society and its ruling class 
were not prepared to do that. 
  The principal difficulty consisted of the fact that 
communists dominated all of our power structures, at all levels. 
I know that in some places in Transcaucasia and in Central Asia 
communists attempted to somehow adapt to the national movement 
or even to head it. In our case the communists unequivocally 
favor the empire and continue to be the main anti-populist force. 
  Barely recovering from the August 1991 putsch and 
Belovezhskaya Pushcha, the "party in power" initiated a 
struggle, first for the total rehabilitation and restoration of 
the power of the Communist Party, and then for the restoration 
of the empire. It has now become particularly animated as the 
imperial forces raise their voices in Russia. 
  [Kovalskaya] Are you against the entry of Belarus in the 
ruble zone? 
  [Bykov] Our directorial corps is strongly in favor of that, 
stating that it promises all kinds of economic advantages. In 
reality our directors know how to work only under conditions of 
a command and specifically an all-union economy because of which 
for them a return to a unified economic system is undoubtedly 
beneficial. I, however, believe that this would be another step 
toward the liquidation of Belarus independence. 
  Among Russian economists there is also not a single one with 
an opinion on that. It seems that Chernomyrdin, and possibly the 
president of Russia, are prepared to incur some economic losses, 
including an increase in the inflation rate, for the sake of 
political goals--retention of Belarus within the Russian sphere 
of influence. 
  [Kovalskaya] What political forces in Belarus do you feel 
closest to? Who will you vote for in the elections? 
  [Bykov] We have a plethora of parties. In reality, however, 
the entire political spectrum in our case is black-and-white or, 
if you will, red-and-white. On one side there are the communist, 
imperial, and anti-national forces, while on the other side 
there are national forces. The Belarusian People's Front has 
real influence among those who are defending the ideals of 
national and state independence. Unfortunately it is represented 
poorly in the leadership of the country--its faction in the 
Supreme Council is very small, while in the executive power 
branch it has no followers at all. 
  The other parties--the Christian-Democratic Party, the 
Social-Democratic Party, and the Peasant Party are quite small 
and not influential. Even though they too proclaim themselves as 
proponents of Belarusian independence. 
  I am, of course, on the side of forces of independence. As 
far as the elections are concerned, I must confess that I do not 
believe not only in the possibility of early elections, but even 
in the presumption that our Supreme Council will go along with 
elections at the time stipulated by law. Our "party in power" is 
intently watching changes taking place in Russia and is becoming 
increasingly convinced that for it there is no need to hurry 
with any changes since there is a chance that everything will go 
back to the way it was. If the elections are held, however, I 
will certainly vote for the People's Front. 
  [Kovalskaya] How about in the presidential election? 
  [Bykov] For Poznyak, if he will be on the ballot. 
  [Kovalskaya] But after all Poznyak is not fair and even 
insulting in his anti-Russian utterances. Inasmuch as I was able 
to notice, many in the People's Front leadership not only do not 
share those views but are even embarrassed by them. 
  [Bykov] It was specifically Poznyak who created the People's 
Front and prevented its split. Yes, many of his positions are 
simply shocking. But at the same time it is hard to argue with 
him: he has experience, both of historical and simply human 
kind. He wrote his well-known article on Russian imperial 
consciousness and imperial policy before the New Year. Only a 
short period of time passed and it turned out to be downright 
prophetic: some statements were made by Kozyrev regarding "the 
sphere of vital Russian in the near abroad," and he asserted 
that troops should not be withdrawn from there--all of which 
disturbed both us and the West. 
  Aggressive nationalism in the republics is whipped up by 
such 
imperial reasoning and is sometimes engendered by it. That is 
understood by many but most try not to talk about it. Poznyak, 
however, is not such a person. Even before the disintegration of 
the USSR, when the CPSU Central Committee managed everything, he 
forcefully took some television air time with his comrades and 
reaching all of Belarus stated that the Communist Party is a 
criminal organization. He was not silent when all others were. 
That is the kind of man he is. 
  Certainly he is a radical, but in contemporary life there is 
no room for a centrist position: all politicians gravitate 
either toward one, the communist, or the other, national, fringe. 
  [Kovalskaya] What about Shushkevich? 
  [Bykov] Shushkevich is a tragic figure. It was specifically 
his attempts to be "a centrist" that played a bad joke on him 
and led to political failure. He is an honest, clever, and an 
intelligent individual, dedicated to democratic ideals, but 
apparently, not for our times. Our times call for Poznyak. 
  [Kovalskaya] Why did the Belarusian People's Front never 
become for Belarusia what Sajudis was for Lithuania, Rukh for 
Ukraine, and Democratic Russia for Russia, failing to become a 
mass-scale popular movement? 
  [Bykov] National self-consciousness is insufficiently 
developed and political culture is lacking. Particularly in view 
of the fact that as living standards deteriorate at present, the 
myth that supposedly "under the communists things were better" 
is gaining strength. 
  In my opinion another myth, which is gaining currency in 
Russia as well, is that people are purportedly too politicized 
and all they do is attend meetings. It would be better if things 
were like they are in the developed countries where no one cares 
about the government at all. All this is fabricated by the 
authorities for the purpose of self-preservation. In actuality 
the population in its absolute majority has no idea at all about 
democratic values, it is not accepting the idea of democracy, 
and does not comprehend the basics of a market society. 
  [Kovalskaya] What do you think is the solution? 
  [Bykov] It is quite evident: the economic system must be 
changed. But that is impossible without a radical political 
reform and especially without a consolidation of national 
statehood. We have already fully partaken of the pleasures of a 
totalitarian empire. In addition to that there is also the 
European experience of national state building. 
  Even closer there is the experience of our neighbors. Yes, 
nothing is so far working out in Ukraine--the power there, 
however, remains in the hands of the same communists. While in 
the Baltic states the reform is proceeding with difficulty but 
successfully even though there are more objective difficulties 
over there than there are in our case: there is also the lack of 
local energy resources, and in general they are poorer with 
regard to resources than we are. They also lack the advantages 
of our geographical position. In addition to that there is the 
nationality factor which, fortunately, will not appear in our 
case unless someone makes a special effort to that end. 
  [Kovalskaya] That is not exactly what I mean--it is 
understood where we should be moving. I asked how you would 
prefer to get out of the current dead-end situation, taking into 
account that you have your Belarusian and not a Lithuanian 
population, and neither Yeltsin nor Gaidar are at the top, but 
your own leadership. 
  [Bykov] With our leadership we will not be moving anywhere. 
With it the only possibility is to turn back. Even if we do go 
back we shall find not the communist past, but ruins. 
  What can be done, you ask? It is necessary to struggle, of 
course, conduct political education. We can be saved only by a 
popular movement. 
  Do you remember the late Alex Adamovich once stating that 
Belarus is the Vendee of reconstruction? Recently he further 
added that we are changing into a peculiar kind of a communist 
Paraguay: all the communists unsuited to the new life are coming 
to us from everywhere. In our country they are living not just 
on their personal pension but are working very actively. 
  Democracy is inevitable. But the price it may be necessary 
for Belarusia to pay for it could be very high. The fact that it 
will be higher than in the Baltic states is without doubt. I do 
not know if it will be higher than in Russia. I fear that Russia 
is yet to pay its price and it is not known what it will amount 
to. 
  [Kovalskaya] Whom do you favor most from among the Russian 
politicians? 
  [Bykov] After all, we are selecting from what exists. Of 
course, Gaidar's group, those linked with reform and democracy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Popular Movement Chairman Sergey </F>
Gaydukevich by Igor Gukovskiy; place and date not given: "We 
Did Not Displace Stanislav Shushkevich"] 
  [Excerpts] At first glance, the Belarusian Popular Movement 
[NDB] -- this colossal political force with more than half a 
million members -- seems to have appeared out of nowhere. But 
this is not true. The explanation is simple -- two years ago, 
large organizations, such as the Communist Party of Belarus, the 
Slavic Assembly "White Russia," the Foundation of the 
Servicemen's Social Protection, and some others, decided to 
merge. As was reported at the time, the purpose of that move 
was to coordinate efforts intended to consolidate society. That 
unification went practically unnoticed for its opponents, who 
were then reveling in their victories in the battle for 
"restoration" [previous word in Belarusian]. The title 
"Belarusian Popular Movement" was certainly selected as an 
opposition to the Popular Front, which monopolized the right to 
speak on behalf of the people. 
  Soon, other organizations joined the NDB. The movement 
gained in strength, while the Popular Front clearly 
disintegrated, letting go an increasing number of "factions" 
that joined small parties. The Popular Front's fate also befell 
other so called democratic organizations -- the United 
Democratic Party of Belarus, the Belarusian Christian Democratic 
Association, DDRB [Movement for Democratic Reforms in Belarus] 
-- debilitated as a result of internal strife. 
  At present, the NDB is undoubtedly the largest and most 
influential political bloc. Our correspondent met with its 
leader, Sergey Gaydukevich. 
  [Gukovskiy] Behind the resignation of Stanislav Shushkevich, 
many see the efforts of the NDB... 
  [Gaydukevich] This is not exactly true. There were a lot 
more votes against the legislative speaker than the NDB actually 
had (three factions -- "union," communists, and veterans). At 
the same time, I am not going to diminish the role of our 
organization, which consistently spoke for Shushkevich's 
resignation. 
  [Gukovskiy] What was it that you did not like about him? 
  [Gaydukevich] He made no resolute decisions over the past 
half a year. 
  I would not like to speak about him as a person. However, as 
a politician, he proved very weak, dependent, and hesitant. He 
has not managed to establish his position on many issues -- the 
collective security treaty, economic integration with Russia, 
the ruble zone, or any other key issues. His haphazard policies 
led the parliament's operations to a deadlock. His continued 
service in office would have exacerbated the situation, creating 
more animosity among factions, groupings, etc. [passage omitted] 
  [Gukovskiy] You accuse the former legislative speaker of 
seeking an illusory accord, vague directions, unclear positions. 
However, the present head of the legislature, right after his 
election to the post, declared that the previous course of 
Belarus will be continued and that he would seek support without 
giving preference to any grouping. 
  [Gaydukevich] Nevertheless, the difference between 
Shushkevich and Hryb is profound. The latter has clearly and 
unequivocally stated that he is for close relations with Russia 
-- Shushkevich just timidly mentioned the need to maintain links 
with it -- for the ruble zone, expanding economic ties, the 
collective security treaty. He said that he supported the 
course of the Belarusian Government. In other words, the man 
determined his position and spoke out on it immediately after 
his election. 
  In all his time as legislative speaker, Shushkevich never 
did 
anything like that. Nobody could understand him. At times, he 
declared that he is a strong supporter of close ties with 
Russia, and at other times, in an interview or during a 
conversation with some oppositionist, he would make assurances 
that he is a staunch advocate of Belarusian independence. When 
the collective security issue was debated, Stanislav Shushkevich 
gave plenty of interviews that did not help, however, to flesh 
out his true opinions. It was not by coincidence that even part 
of the opposition voted against him. Toward the end of his 
term, he lost support of not only the legislative majority but 
also that of the opposition. The most regrettable thing is that 
the people did not get a chance to know what kind of Belarus 
Shushkevich wanted to see. 
  Like Gorbachev, Shushkevich attempted to sit on several 
chairs at a time. A seasoned card player, he wanted to play 
with everyone. But every game is played by its own rules and a 
clearly specified number of players. 
  If Shushkevich had had political convictions, he would have 
certainly found allies in parliament. It takes some talent to 
find no support in a legislature swarming with numerous factions! 
  [Gukovskiy] Do you think Shushkevich will return to big 
politics, as is predicted by many political observers, including 
Russian ones? 
  [Gaydukevich] Never. That is the "Gorbachev-2" case. There 
were many predictions after the resignation of the first, and 
the last, Soviet president. Unfortunately, you will get nowhere 
in politics without a clear program and position. 
  [Gukovskiy] The NDB, the largest legislative grouping, did 
not propose him as a candidate for president. Why? It was your 
best chance to come to power, which the Marxists said is the 
chief purpose of political struggle. 
  [Gaydukevich] We had our candidates, but they declined their 
nominations. As for the struggle for power, we remain faithful 
to the fundamental idea of our movement -- consolidation. We 
were aware of the fact that a speaker from the NDB would have 
triggered a real explosion, which would be very divisive and 
distracting for the parliament. After discussing Hryb's 
candidacy, we came to a conclusion: This is the man who in this 
situation suits everyone. He does not want confrontation but is 
able to ensure efficient operations of our legislative body. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Gukovskiy] What do you think about the opposition's 
proposal 
to form a coalition government before calling early elections? 
  [Gaydukevich] We are against it. The opposition proposed to 
dissolve the Supreme Council and give power to a narrow group of 
like-minded politicians. The opposition's purpose is clear, 
which is to take advantage of the present state of confusion. 
Just look at what demands were trotted out by the Popular Front 
and the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly [BDSG]. In their 
opinion, the coalition government should consist of only the 
people who support their ideas. That is absurd! This would 
immediately put the parties standing for, say, bilingualism or 
collective security out the equation. In other words, the 
largest political forces, including the NDB, are automatically 
removed from the political scene. 
  [Gukovskiy] Did NDB representatives meet with Mechyslaw Hryb 
after he was elected Supreme Soviet chairman? 
  [Gaydukevich] No, they did not. I believe that the 
initiative to meet should come from Mechyslaw Ivanovich himself. 
We have made our move by sending him a telegram with 
congratulations on his new appointment. Hryb and Kebich made a 
good declaration calling for contacts with all political forces. 
All forces! The former speaker has never even thought about 
it. He kept saying "accord" [preceding word in Belarusian], but 
as far as I can remember, he met only with the BDSG and the 
United Democratic Party of Belarus. 
  [Gukovskiy] You say that early elections are necessary. 
When do you think they should be called? Are you sure that 
they will take place at all? 
  [Gaydukevich] I think they will actually take place. The 
Supreme Soviet made a relevant decision on this. When? 
Summertime is the time of vacations; it cannot be in March or 
early April, according to the law, which requires a two-month 
waiting period. They cannot be held in April and May, as people 
will be busy with the sowing campaign. The most convenient time 
would be early fall. 
  [Gukovskiy] You have repeatedly said that the NDB stands for 
closer union with Russia. Just like in Belarus, a variety of 
political force are active in that country, including in the 
highest echelons of power. With which of them are you seeking a 
union? 
  [Gaydukevich] I have always said: Politicians come and go, 
but the people remain. We will cooperate with all those who 
stand for the unity of the Slavic peoples. I would rather not 
be in position to name specific parties or individuals. Our 
position may clear after meetings with representatives of the 
entire political spectrum of Russia, which we are planning to 
hold as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alexei Barbaneagra, minister of justice of </F>
the Republic of Moldova, by V. Dubovoy: place and date not 
given: "Poor-Quality Justice Costing the Government Dearly"] 
  [Text] The process involved in establishment of the 
democratic state of Moldova is inconceivable without 
reorganization and perfection of the entire judicial and legal 
system. Over the past several years a concept for legal reform 
was worked out in the republic, and enforceable enactments were 
adopted regulating the transformation processes. The 
achievements as well as difficulties that have been encountered 
were discussed with our correspondent by Alexei Barbaneagra, 
minister of justice of the republic of Moldova. 
  [Dubovoy] Mister Minister, the draft of a concept for 
judicial reform in the republic of Moldova was prepared by the 
Ministry of Justice, and you personally were one of its 
creators. A draft law on judicial and legal reform was likewise 
prepared and submitted to parliament for review, but there are 
still no results. What is the reason for that? 
  [Barbaneagra] The situation is indeed the way you described 
it. I am not clear as to the reasons why the draft law on legal 
reform in the republic of Moldova was not reviewed by the old 
parliament. I believe that the new parliament, realizing the 
importance attached to the resolution of this question, will 
include it in its agenda. 
  After all, in our opinion legal reform must serve to 
guarantee statehood and democracy and the successful advance of 
economic transformations, because of which its earliest possible 
adoption is necessary. 
  Thus far republic legal organs continue performing their 
functions relying on laws which, unfortunately, have nothing but 
a negative effect on the results of our activity. 
  [Dubovoy] Another year has passed. What was it like for the 
judicial organs of the republic and the Ministry of Justice as a 
whole? 
  [Barbaneagra] Over the past year work at the ministry was 
aimed at the elaboration of draft laws and enforceable 
enactments, submission of conclusions regarding new laws, 
systematization of legislation, and the provision of Moldovan 
citizens with necessary legal information. 
  Last year alone personnel of the ministry prepared and 
provided conclusions on 1,160 draft enforceable enactments. 
Judicial activity deserves particular attention. Last year the 
courts handled 12,005 criminal cases, which is 852 cases more 
than in 1992, along with some 30,368 civil cases. Practically 
all of them were reviewed. So far, however, we are not satisfied 
with the activity of rayon and city district courts as there are 
frequent cases of delays in the review of cases which leaves 
something to be desired with respect to the case review process 
itself. 
  That is why, for the purpose of improving the skill levels 
of 
judges the ministry organized probationary training at the 
Supreme Court in 1993 for 75 young jurists while more than 80 
judges underwent professional re-certification. 
  Unfortunately judges themselves commit violations of the 
law, 
because of which 12 judges as well as 18 bailiffs were punished 
last year for various infractions. 
  The physical plant at the courts needs strengthening, it is 
necessary to provide them with technical means. Computers, Xerox 
machines, and other modern technical facilities--all that so far 
is only a dream for us. 
  [Dubovoy] Alexei Afanasyevich. You stated that the judges 
also break the law. In this connection how is the law on 
languages being enforced by court personnel? 
  [Barbaneagra] We are monitoring its enforcement and I am 
pleased to note that by comparison with 1989, when not a single 
sentence was passed in the state language or a ruling given, 
last year the majority of sentences (in 63 percent of the 
criminal and 52.2 percent of civil cases) were passed in the 
courts of Moldova in the Romanian language. That, in turn, means 
that judges are making their contribution to the consolidation 
of the law on languages. 
  [Dubovoy] Recently the Ministry of Justice of the republic 
of 
Moldova established close ties with international legal organs, 
institutes, and the like. Which of the contacts are clearly 
promoting the expansion of links between jurists of Moldova and 
those of other countries while strengthening legal organs in the 
republic. What are some of the initial results of such 
collaboration? 
  [Barbaneagra] There is no doubt that we need such contacts 
not only for the exchange of views, but also for close 
cooperation with international legal organizations which are 
manifesting lively interest in all that is taking place within 
the republic of Moldova and are helping us with the elaboration 
of enforceable enactments, conducting expert reviews of laws 
that have already been adopted, and promoting the integration of 
our state in the world legal community. Close ties with 
representatives of the European Community, the CSCE Mission, the 
European Council, the Association of American Lawyers, the For 
Democracy Fund, and with others were established. 
  Our jurists participated in the work of international 
symposiums and conferences on legal issues. On more than one 
occasion we received invitations from various international 
organizations for us to study judicial systems functioning in 
different countries. 
  Recently personnel from our ministry visited Germany, Italy, 
and Switzerland where they studied the operation of law 
enforcement organs. Experts from international organizations 
favored the extension of aid to specialists of Moldova in the 
area of law, and the problem concerning training and retraining 
of our personnel is being resolved along with the one pertaining 
to the provision of courts of the republic with necessary 
technical means. We are striving to expand the sphere of such 
contacts and to create all possible premises for fruitful 
collaboration with jurists in foreign countries to the benefit 
of our republic. 
  [Dubovoy] An important place in the work of the Ministry of 
Justice is occupied by the preparation and conclusion of 
international agreements on legal aid and legal relations in the 
area of civil, criminal and family law. A few words about how 
this area of jurisprudence is faring. 
  [Barbaneagra] The elaboration of such agreements is a 
complicated and a laborious matter. As of today Moldova has 
signed agreements on legal aid and legal relations in the area 
of civil, criminal, and family law with Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, 
and Lithuania. In the very near future such agreements will be 
concluded with Georgia and Azerbaijan, as well as other 
republics of the former USSR. 
  As far as legal aid for the population is concerned, as a 
result of a significant rise in the cost of legal services of 
jurists, the citizens of Moldova are reverting to their services 
much less frequently which, for understandable reasons, cannot 
help but alert us since that, I am assuming, is also a matter of 
state policy. 
  [Dubovoy] What else is of concern to the minister of 
justice? 
  [Barbaneagra] A rise in the crime rate, a certain 
pathological lack of respect for existing laws is disturbing. 
Democratic transformations in the republic are being hindered by 
delays in the adoption of judicial and legal reforms. The 
imperfect nature of the legislation and in certain cases its 
absence, makes it impossible to resolve many vitally important 
problems of society. One would like to believe that many of 
today's problems will be resolved and democratic transformations 
in the Republic of Moldova will acquire a firm legal basis. 
  [Dubovoy] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Claudia Melnic, minister of finance of the </F>
Republic of Moldova, by Ivan Koretskiy, under the "Our 
Interviews" rubric; place and date not given: "Claudia Melnic: 
We Have Destroyed a Lot, Let Us Create"] 
  [Text] 
  [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, you have quite a busy 
schedule, and due to this our conversation has been postponed a 
number of times. Tell me please, what does the minister of 
finance and the ministry headed by her work on so intensively? 
  [Melnic] It so happened that the adoption of documents that 
are highly significant for the economy, business life, and the 
social sphere occurred at the end of last year and the beginning 
of this year. These are entire packages of solutions associated 
with the introduction of a national currency, amendments to 
laws, and the introduction of excise taxes. Some of them have 
already been published in the press in the form of edicts of the 
president of Moldova, and the rest are still being worked on. 
  Unfortunately, the Parliament did not complete its 
law-creating activities, and we have to look for a way out of 
the situation. The economy must work, and the budget must be 
replenished through both production and taxes. Some of the 
taxes--on real estate, natural resources, bank profits, and 
insurance operations--are already operational. A number of 
laws--on the value-added tax, on local taxes--have been 
developed and are being considered by the Parliament and the 
government. Apparently, they will also be enacted by a 
presidential edict in order to be subsequently submitted to the 
new Parliament to be discussed and adopted. All of them will 
become components of the state tax system. In this manner, we 
are trying to lay the foundation of a tax system that would be 
in line with the conditions of a market economy and would make 
it possible to make mutual relations between the state and 
producers, entrepreneurs, and the population stable. 
  At present, the view exists that our tax system is 
oppressive, although international experts evaluate it as being 
reasonable. Thus, in the year 1993 the total amount of tax 
revenues, including the social fund, is expected to reach 11-12 
percent of the gross national product. In 1991, it stood at 38 
percent, and in the current year 1994--15-18 percent. Therefore, 
a stable tax system is emerging here, and it is beginning to 
regulate the process of capital flows and to secure a balance of 
sectors and areas of entrepreneurial activities. 
  [Koretskiy] Madam Minister, you have referred to the 
value-added tax. It will affect primarily those to whom we 
attach hopes for overcoming the crisis--the producers. A lot 
depends on what this tax will be. 
  [Melnic] Indeed, this is one of the key aspects, and not 
just 
here, but in the CIS countries--after all, we have all come out 
of the same economic system. For now, the value-added tax is not 
changing. It should be coordinated with all economic partners. 
Unfortunately, this issue was removed from the agenda at a 
meeting in Ashgabat, because an agreement on the uniform rate of 
the value-added tax in the process of switching to world-market 
prices on 1 January 1994 and on arrangements for its collection 
could not be reached. 
  It is not advantageous for the republics to add this tax to 
the world-market prices for raw materials, because in this case 
the cost of manufactured goods will be higher than world prices. 
This means that products will be noncompetitive from the start. 
A balanced approach is required of us in this instance. 
  [Koretskiy] So have we been importing and exporting products 
at world-market prices from New Year's day on? 
  [Melnic] The issue of world-market prices has been resolved. 
In the process, we succeeded in defending the interests of the 
republic. For example, Russia tried to secure the setting of 
world-market prices only for the products that are quoted on the 
world market, i.e. oil, electricity, metal, timber. In this 
case, it will turn out that nobody needs our tomatoes, even at a 
negotiated price. We believe that the right of all CIS countries 
to use world-market prices in settlements among themselves is 
unshakeable. This is a complicated problem.... 
  However, I would like to go back to your first question and 
say that the Ministry of Finance has done a great volume of work 
to come up with funds for the additional social protection of 
the low-income strata of the population. You know that an edict 
on the minimum wage has been issued, and that it is built on a 
differentiated approach to various groups of the population. 
This is associated with the sharp growth of expenditures for 
energy resources. For example, the expenditure of funds for 
heating comes to 15-17 lei per person. Meanwhile, the growth of 
the average wage is falling behind considerably. 
  [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, this begs the natural 
question: Why do wages never keep up with expenditures? Our 
readers are asking in their letters and telephone calls: How is 
one to survive in the future, given that a consumer basket costs 
80-100 lei, whereas the minimum salary comes to 13 lei? 
  [Melnic] I would like to note that the welfare of the people 
does not hinge on edicts to raise wages. Wage increases 
immediately entail quite a tangle of closely intertwined 
economic, financial, and political problems. We have put the 
state budget together based on the average monthly salary of 15 
lei, aiming at smooth quarterly salary raises. Any abrupt leap 
amounts to an impulse for inflationary processes and the growth 
of prices. For our part, we are trying as best we can to contain 
these processes which affect the population adversely. 
  There have been certain shortcomings in the policy of 
remunerations for labor and social welfare. We should inform the 
population in advance about the expected price increases, the 
rate of inflation, and wage increases. However, we must also 
talk about something else. I have here on my desk data on the 
average monthly salary for November 1993. For the employees of 
state structures, it came to 63.4 lei, transportation 
employees--58.7 lei, industry personnel--84.2 lei, and the 
employees of the agrarian complex (kolkhozes, sovkhozes)--35.5 
lei. This does not include payments in kind. Therefore, a 
judgment cannot be formed solely on the basis of the size of the 
minimum wage. 
  Still, our social fund is very weak. The priority task of 
both our government and Parliament and those of the future is to 
reinforce it, so that the people will feel confident. The people 
should be protected. 
  [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, what is your assessment of 
last year? 
  [Melnic] It was a difficult year, but during the year we 
succeeded in the most important endeavor--to keep the peace. Not 
everything has yet been settled in mutual relations with the 
Dniester area, and the time has come to take measures to resolve 
this issue. I think that the new Parliament will be up to that. 
  Here is another favorable aspect: During the year, our 
production smoothly and inconspicuously discontinued its fall 
and stabilized, and on some scores we even have increases. We 
succeeded in limiting expenditures and containing the growth of 
prices compared to other CIS countries. We avoided a crisis in 
the budget system and, you will recall, there were no delays in 
the payment of wages and funding for expenditures as we had had 
before. 
  The volume of work for our ministry was simply tremendous. 
After all, the budget was approved thrice in one year. Besides, 
the state succeeded in settling its balance of payments, and now 
we can make provisions for financial reserve and conduct 
negotiations about credit. The state budget for 1993 was 
implemented by 104.3 percent on the revenue side, and the 
republic budget--by 101.4 percent. 
  [Koretskiy] Is it really that everything was good, and no 
mistakes or miscalculations of any kind were allowed to occur? 
  [Melnic] Unfortunately, as early as the beginning of the 
year, the government failed correctly to allocate capital 
investment. Later, in the middle of the year, we were forced to 
"freeze" 600 facilities under construction. We were not always 
able correctly to project the rate of inflation, which was 
mainly dictated by leaps in the prices for energy resources. We 
did not manage to do many things, because of the absence of a 
legislative base. As I have said before, we are now making up 
for it by way of presidential edicts, so that reforms will not 
get bogged down. 
  There were miscalculations, indeed. For example, we did not 
succeed in fully restoring the system for managing the state 
sector on a new, market foundation. It is known that the old 
system has been completely destroyed. An owner should manage his 
property; otherwise, the threat of losing this property will 
arise. After all, in the process of privatization the state will 
retain about 65 percent of the property, and it is necessary to 
manage it wisely in order for the state to be a guarantor of 
welfare and the effectiveness of operation of its enterprises on 
an equal footing with other owners. 
  It is also necessary to streamline the system of 
remunerations for labor, in order to avoid the tremendous 
imbalance whereby at one enterprise they make 20 lei and at 
another, 200 lei, with no regard for labor productivity. For the 
state sector, we should make the procedures for the distribution 
of profits between accumulation and consumption more rigid, so 
that enterprises will use their profits for production purposes, 
investment, and incentives for production, rather than just 
wages. It is possible that we will have to limit wages, say, to 
the level of 25 times the minimum wage, that is, set a limit for 
remunerations for labor. For example, such restrictions apply in 
countries such as Japan and Switzerland. These measures will 
become acutely necessary if the economic forms of affecting 
consumption produce no results. 
  [Koretskiy] What were the successes of the year? 
  [Melnic] Certainly, the adoption of a national currency, 
although we did not succeed in including the entire republic. 
The Ministry of Finance has always come out for settling 
relations with the Dniester area prior to the introduction of 
the national currency. A great many problems will now develop. 
After all, the people have not severed family, business, or 
production relations, and for that reason all of them are now 
experiencing great inconvenience. The inconvenience is 
associated with elementary payments for all services, 
deliveries, and purchases. It appears to me that the authorities 
of Tiraspol should take some measures so that the leu will 
circulate similarly in the eastern rayons of the Republic of 
Moldova, although for them this is also a political issue. After 
all, they cannot live on ration cards forever. The currency 
should work, and should bring the people closer together. 
  Last year, we also succeeded in preparing a draft budget for 
1994 and in getting it approved ahead of time, prior to 1 
January 1994. I will say frankly that the employees of our 
ministry and I are very happy about this fact, because a budget 
approved before the beginning of the year (for the first time in 
the last three years) means stability for all producers, 
consumers, and the social infrastructure. It is already clear 
which taxes will be levied, where profits will go, and how much 
will have to be withheld and for what. 
  It is possible that the budget for the second half of the 
year will have to be updated. Everything will depend on the size 
of emission, the growth of prices, and inflation. However, I 
will stress that everything depends on ourselves, on the rate of 
production, all the more so because the Ministry of Finance will 
not receive credit from the National Bank of Moldova this year. 
We should cover the deficit in full by issuing securities and 
receiving foreign credit. 
  In general, international credit, support from the World 
Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Governments of 
the Russian Federation and Romania were very helpful in 
overcoming the economic crisis caused by the war and the 
drought. With this credit, the government purchased grain, 
seeds, fertilizer, spare parts, fuel, and medicines. The 
production and social spheres were supported out of them. 
  [Koretskiy] Perhaps, as a former banker and the current 
minister of finance, you, Claudia Vasilyevna, know the saying 
about credit which is as old as the hills: You take someone 
else's, and you give back yours. How are we going to settle for 
the debt? Are we not taking on too much credit? 
  [Melnic] Of course, it would be better to do without credit. 
However, this is not possible in the environment of a 
transitional economy. After all, our state, just like the rest 
of the CIS countries, is insolvent. Meanwhile, we need to live, 
work, turn out products, and buy goods. You will seek credit 
whether you like it or not. The terms on which it is received 
are another matter. The government has done a lot of work in 
this area, so that these outlays will be used wisely and that 
the consequence of their use will not place a heavy burden on 
our children. I will say that a memorandum on the economic 
policy of the state has been signed for 1994. It has been 
discussed with international experts and gained approval. 
Therefore, our economic policy has been found correct. In 
December, the IMF resolved to grant us credit in the form of a 
stand-by facility which opens certain prospects in Moldova's 
relationship with the rest of the world. 
  We now need to support production in every way possible, 
give 
incentives to producers and the structures working to benefit 
them. This is a way out of the situation and a guarantee for the 
repayment of credit. Why import when it is possible to produce 
here, locally, with material, tax, financial, and credit 
support? This means an increase in production, an abundance of 
goods, new jobs, and the growth of exports. In this case, it 
will be easier to settle for credit. 
  [Koretskiy] Madam Minister, allow me to familiarize you with 
one of the numerous letters received by our newspaper and 
addressed to the government of which you are a member. In the 
letter, a reader complains: "The impoverishment of the people 
progresses year after year. For years, the people set aside 
their savings at the most reliable bank, the Savings Bank, only 
to be left high and dry now. Through the effort of our rulers, 
our savings have turned to dust. At present, one cannot buy a 
funeral shroud with them, let alone ensure a decent funeral for 
himself...." 
  [Melnic] I must note that these accusations are not leveled 
at the real culprits, and I will explain why. The shock therapy 
of 1991 blew the savings of the people away like a whirlwind. 
The Government of the USSR and our Moldovan Government had a 
hand in it. Until 1 January 1992, about 5 billion rubles [R] 
were borrowed from the Savings Bank of Moldova with a view to 
covering the deficit of the Union budget. By now, this debt has 
been fully paid by the government. All arrears on various 
compensation payments have also been paid in full. The Ministry 
of Finance has also paid in full the value of the state 
securities of the former USSR. Therefore, all of our 
relationships with the deposits of the population have been 
completed. 
  I believe that indexation should be performed out of the 
profits of the Savings Bank, in keeping with the Law on 
Indexation. It is the savings banks that administer profits 
rather than the state. They charge 200-270 percent in interest 
rates on credit, and pay next to nothing to the depositors. 
They, the depositors, should demand appropriate payments and 
indexation directly from the Savings Bank. 
  [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, you are the only female 
minister of the government. Tell us how you handle this burden 
of responsibilities. 
  [Melnic] This is not a job for a woman. You are busy 16-18 
hours a day, and then you have a family and children! In 
addition, you take work home every evening in order to manage, 
and there are no days off.... One needs nerves of steel and 
health to endure this. 
  I have endured because I continuously got support from my 
male colleagues. I will say frankly that on occasion I have 
abused the fact that I am a woman in resolving significant 
issues of principle. However, this is no way out anyway. I hope 
that a man will come to this position who will have enough 
willpower, persistence, and experience to implement the 
financial stabilization policy. 
  [Koretskiy] Should this be interpreted to say that you are 
completing your political career? 
  [Melnic] I have never considered myself a politician. 
Considering myself a specialist--indeed, and then a specialist 
of the old school, for whom the words of a song, "Think about 
the motherland first, and about yourself next" is the creed of 
life. 
  I came to this position contrary to my own wishes and the 
wishes of my loved ones, and solely on the condition that there 
would be no more war, and that the government of national accord 
would not allow this nightmare to occur. 
  Despite all the difficulties, this has been a happy and 
interesting period in my life. Together with the staff of the 
Ministry of Finance, who are capable of moving mountains, we 
have managed to accomplish a lot, and this is gratifying.

<F P=106> [Interview with Constantin Antoci, Lt Gen of Police and </F>
Minister of internal Affairs of the Republic of Moldova, 
conducted by Boris Marian and Igor Kondrashkin, time and place 
not specified] 
  [Text] 
  [Interviewer] A traditional question, mister minister, or 
rather a suggestion. Let us summarize the results of the last 
year in your department. First the pleasing ones, and leave the 
unhappy ones for later. 
  [Antoci] Permit me to give a somewhat untraditional answer 
to 
your tradition question about "pleasing results." Needless to 
say, there is nothing simpler that to select the very figures 
that would satisfy you out of the enormous mass of statistical 
data and offer them to the public. But I would like to draw 
attention to those details which define the essence of the 
criminogenic situation and are fundamental. 
  The reader should not be intimidated by the significant 
number of statistical layouts that we resort to; you can judge 
the results of our work by them, and so we cannot get along 
without them. 
  In 1991 the level of crime per 10,000 population was 102.1. 
In 1992 it was 90.1. Last year it was 85.1. So we can say with 
full certainty that the trend is positive, there is some decline 
in the crime rate. All this contradicts the common opinion that 
crime is constantly growing in the republic. 
  One more important aspect is the situation and trend in the 
crimes that are classified as serious. In comparison the 1992 
this indicator dropped by 1.4 percent. This might appear to be a 
very insignificant reduction, but if you consider that serious 
crimes in the republic as a whole have shown a consistent 
tendency to grow in recent years, the positive changes and the 
effectiveness of the measures we are taking in this area must be 
recognized. 
  The activism and labor productivity of our employees has 
risen in an absolute majority of the city and rayon police 
divisions. 
  The percentage of crimes solved is properly considered the 
main criterion for evaluating the activity of internal affairs 
organs. Last year this indicator (I will add, a very important 
one) rose from 35.3 to 46.6 percent. But it still does not 
satisfy us. 
  [Interviewer] And us, the inhabitants of Moldova, even less. 
Numbers are well and good, but the social terror is more real 
than statistics. It results above all from the sharp growth in 
crime, especially among young people. Drug addiction, 
prostitution. How are police organs fighting this social evil? 
  [Antoci] In 1993 our police recorded 1,972 crimes committed 
by adolescents. Unfortunately, growth of crimes among young 
people in recent years is raising its own "goals." It is 
especially bad in this sense in Belts, Bender, and Ryshkan. And 
in Ungen the increase was some 350 percent!? 
  Unfortunately, the number of serious crimes committed by 
adolescents has also increased. There were 125 percent more 
homicides, 40 percent more cases of serious bodily injury, and 
19 percent more rapes. 
  The figures are very alarming. The socioeconomic condition 
of 
the republic, the sharp reduction in jobs, and the closing of 
numerous educational institutions are significant factors in all 
this. 
  As for drug addiction, the main efforts of the republic's 
internal affairs organs have been directed to prevention and 
quickly solving crimes committed by addicts. But meanwhile drug 
addiction and illegal trade in psychotropic substances in the 
republic are growing in scale. It is becoming a serious social 
evil. In 1993 police organs recorded 265 crimes related to 
illegal trade in narcotics (248 of them or 93.6 percent were 
solved). But in 1992 there were just 120 such crimes. Such a 
rate of growth puts you very much on guard. Ten of "our" 
Moldovan citizens were arrested for trade in narcotics in 
Romania, and two in Ukraine. On the other hand, we have plenty 
of "visitors" from other regions. For example, in September of 
last year our people arrested a certain P. Portnov from Samara, 
a shipping agent of the Samaramebel Joint-Stock Society, in the 
Oknitsa hotel, and found that he had 8 kilograms of poppy heads. 
A more recent example occurred on 12 January when S. Grishin, a 
Russian citizen, was arrested in Oknitsa in possession of 8.7 
kilograms of this toxic substance. 
  Another problem is also alarming--the decline in morals, 
especially among young people. This has led to the formation of 
a specialized division, the morals police within the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs system, by Decision of the Presidium of the 
Parliament of the Republic of Moldova. The division engages in 
preventing and stopping propaganda for pornography, sadism, and 
the cult of violence and fights the spread of AIDS and venereal 
diseases, prostitution, and other offenses against public 
morality. 
  [Interviewer] A new generation has joined police organs 
recently. Police work is complex. They deal with people. 
Crudeness, lack of tact, and insensitivity are intolerable here. 
Probably many moral qualities of the future guardians of order 
and legality must be taken into account in recruiting them. In 
general, how is personnel selection organized in your 
organization, and how do you fight for the honor of the uniform? 
This question also ties in with the fact that, alas, among the 
police there have been extortionists, thieves, and many other 
violators of the law. Our journalists sometimes write about them. 
  [Antoci] It should be clear to everyone that with the 
transition to market relations, unrestrained inflation, and 
unemployment, which have separated people into prosperous and 
needy, police work has become much more complicated. 
  Based on this the 1 December 1992 Decree of the Government 
of 
the Republic of Moldova reorganized the structure of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and police subdivisions 
fundamentally. The number of municipal, criminal, economic, and 
highway police and investigators was brought into line with 
present-day requirements. 
  The Ministry of Internal Affairs is working seriously on 
selection of new, qualified employees to fill vacant positions. 
The moral and work characteristics of the candidates are 
necessarily considered in selection. They undergo 
psycho-physiological testing at the military medical commission. 
  In 1993 more than 2,500 people were admitted to the service. 
Among them were 756 in leadership positions. Unfortunately, only 
191 of the persons admitted into the service had specialized 
legal education (at present the capacities of the specialized 
educational institutions are very limited). 
  It should also be acknowledged here, unfortunately, that 
accidental people, violators of discipline, and even people who 
have taken up the path of crime do get into our ranks. In 1993 
668 persons were discharged from internal affairs organs for 
committing actions that discredited the title of police officer 
and 95 were discharged for service unsuitability. 
  People also leave our ranks for other reasons. The level of 
pay is inadequate, and domestic conditions are hard. It is a big 
mistake to think that police have an easy life. We have many 
purely domestic concerns. 
  [Interviewer] If it is not a secret, how many members are 
there in the Moldovan police and what does the rank-and-rile 
police employee earn? Ordinary people are jealous of them and 
believe they get fantastic amounts. But in talking with police 
employees you also hear complaints. Arbitrary leveling occurs, 
they say. Detectives receive about the same as police employees 
sitting in warm, comfortable offices. The one is constantly on 
the brink of danger and may get a bullet or a--excuse the 
term--"pen" [criminal slang for "knife"] in the stomach, while 
the other takes no risks. 
  [Antoci] Overall the number of police employees relative to 
the population of Moldova is no higher than in the republics of 
the CIS or other countries and it has not changed in the last 3 
years. Military servicemen of the carbine troops are also used 
to patrol and guard certain sites to fight crime in many cities 
and populated points. 
  As for pay, it depends of the employee's years of service in 
the police and ranges from 40 to 150 lei. You must agree that 
that is not so much. At some enterprises and companies, for 
example, people receive much more just for services in guarding 
a site. You should not forget about the extreme conditions in 
which most of our police personnel work. 
  About "leveling." Indeed, the pay system that exists today 
does not, unfortunately, permit a differentiated approach to 
defining the labor of each individual employee. But the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs is preparing appropriate proposals on this. 
It is true that at present employees of the operational 
services, investigation, and other subdivisions with especially 
difficult working conditions receive pay supplements (from 15 to 
50 percent of their salaries) depending on results achieved, and 
preferences in acquiring the next rank have been established in 
the operational services to retain our primary core group of 
professionals. 
  [Interviewer] Is your system experiencing what is called the 
"brain drain"? There was a time when outstanding specialists 
were forced to look for work outside the republic or in 
profit-making structures here. 
  [Antoci] I have already answered that question in part when 
I 
spoke of the very difficult period in which we are all living. 
The sharp decline in the economy could not help but be reflected 
in what you call the "brain drain." Unfortunately, outstanding 
specialists, top-quality professionals, are abandoning our ranks 
today too, even before reaching the desired pension age. But 
only a few find work outside the republic. Most of them, 
dissatisfied with the pay and working conditions, leave and find 
work in profit-making structures within the republic. This 
continues to be a sore spot for us. 
  [Interviewer] There is an economic police force. In addition 
the Moldovan Ministry of Finance formed a financial guard. Isn't 
there duplication of work here, unnecessary activity and waste 
of money? 
  [Antoci] That is a timely question. In fact, in the initial 
stage of transition of the economy to the free market with its 
companies, concerns, commercial banks and so on, other control 
organs were formed in the republic in addition to the economic 
police, among them the financial guard. But experience confirmed 
your fears and ours: duplication started and dispersion of 
funds, and it became necessary to review the staff of the 
control organs. Substantiated proposals on this matter have 
already been submitted to the Government of the Republic of 
Moldova. The essential point of them is that for purposes of 
more effective crime fighting it would be advisable in this 
sphere to form a single professional control organ on the basis 
of the economic police and the financial guard. 
  [Interviewer] Our last question, with hopes for an 
optimistic 
answer. Will the mighty detachment of Moldovan police be able to 
significantly reduce the level of crime in the coming year? Will 
we be able, suppose, to go for peaceful family walks in the 
evening in any remote part of the city, places where today--why 
hide it--you will not find any police patrols? 
  [Antoci] I think that we have grounds for cautious optimism. 
Let me repeat, cautious. The time of mindless "deadlines" for 
eliminating crime and posing the challenge of "sharply reducing 
it" has passed. Everything is much more complex than that. 
  The criminal world reacts quickly to the various changes in 
society. It is extremely dangerous today. It is well organized, 
corrupt, very well armed, and unrestrained in its choice of 
means. 
  General success in the struggle to root out the criminal 
world will come only with a general normalization of the moral 
climate of society. But the police must oppose the criminal 
world and they can do it. 
  Yes, it is the duty of the policy to guard order and the 
lawful interests of our people, but the people themselves can 
actively help the police. 
  [Interviewer] Thank you, mister minister, for your answers.

<F P=106> [Article by Bettina Burger and Markus Lenzer: "Tallinn's </F>
Reform Successes With Social Difficulties"] 
  [Text] Hamburg--The slump in the Estonian economy is likely 
to come to an end by the turn of the year. As early as 1992 the 
drop in the real GDP was 20 to 25 percent lower than originally 
forecast. 
  If it should be confirmed that in the past year the GDP grew 
from a nominal 13.5 billion Estonian kroons (8 Estonian kroons = 
1 German mark) in 1992 to about 20 billion kroons, one would 
even have to anticipate a slight amount of growth in real GDP 
for 1993, with a moderate annual inflation of about 30 percent. 
  The driving force behind the economic development is to an 
increasing extent private companies. These usually involve newly 
founded firms and privatized state-owned enterprises. 
  The government has succeeded in rapidly promoting 
privatization in some sectors. With the creation of a single 
privatization agency in the summer of 1993, privatization 
activities were also organizationally streamlined and the 
potential overlapping of expertise avoided. 
<H5>  Tourism and Marine Transportation With High Growth Rates </H5>
  By the end of December 1993, 45 out of the total of 130 
internationally competing major companies had been wholly or 
partially privatized. In the framework of small-scale 
privatization, over the first nine months of 1993 approximately 
60 percent of the small industrial enterprises had been 
transferred to private hands. In this area the pace of 
privatization will slow down, however, since questions of the 
legality of property created before the independence ("black 
privatization") have not yet been solved. 
  In the trade and service sector, the transfer of property 
should continue to take place quickly. About 80 percent of the 
privatization had been completed by the fall of 1993. 
  While all of industry is recovering only slowly, the service 
industries of tourism and marine transportation are recording 
high growth rates. The income from these services at present 
represents Estonia's most important source of foreign revenue. 
The extensive influx of foreign currency simultaneously 
reinforces confidence in the Estonian kroon. 
<H5>  A Restrictive Monetary and Fiscal Policy </H5>
  One guarantee of the stability of the Estonian kroon is a 
restrictive monetary and fiscal policy, which continues to be 
consistently implemented by the central bank and the government. 
For the current year an inflation rate of about 20 percent is 
anticipated. This figure was also taken as the basis for the 
1994 national budget passed in December 1993 with a total volume 
of 5.7 billion kroons. 
  To make it possible to have the balanced budget mandated by 
law, the spending margins for 1994 have been set just as narrow 
as in the previous year's budget. However, these economy 
measures represent a significant component of the stability 
policy. But those portions of the population which are 
particularly affected by the economic conversion process suffer 
particularly from this, among them unemployed, retirees, and 
families with many children. 
  The small amount of money for unemployment compensation is 
offered through an employment fund, which is exclusively funded 
by the national treasury. At 180 kroons the unemployment 
compensation is clearly below the minimum subsistence level of 
280 kroons. It is therefore so low that many unemployed do not 
even turn to the labor office where they are officially 
registered. 
  The official unemployment figures, which form the basis for 
the state's spending, greatly improve on the actual employment 
development. While the official unemployment rate on 1 September 
1993 was 1.84 percent (16,151 unemployed), the actual rate of 
unemployed is estimated to be three to four times higher. For 
the end of 1994 an official unemployment figure of 40,000 
persons is expected. 
  A faster drop in employment is anticipated above all in the 
heavy industrial enterprises, since they are still at the 
beginning of the restructuring. Many workers have already been 
affected by a cutback in working hours and forced vacations. 
Between January and July 1993 nearly 27,000 workers were thus 
temporarily laid off. 
  The lack of financial means also prevents the necessary 
expansion of the administrative organization. For this reason 
people looking for work can only expect little support from the 
labor offices in helping to find jobs. Training and continuing 
education programs are still largely lacking. 
<H5>  The State Must Subsidize the Social Funds </H5>
  Pensions and child subsidies are financed through the social 
fund, the second leg of the social net. The social fund receives 
most of its funding from employer contributions (social taxes). 
Due to the poor payment ethics of business owners, about 
one-third of the fund must be subsidized by the state. Here as 
well the financial scope permits only minor support payments and 
for those affected it means a daily struggle for survival. The 
amount of the pension, which so far is still independent of 
income, is usually the minimum subsistence level. 
  To guarantee at least a cost-of-living adjustment for all 
subsidies, including unemployment money, employment and social 
funds had to be financially replenished. The amendment to the 
social law, which took effect at the beginning of the year, can 
be regarded as a small step in this direction. It enables better 
control and sanction mechanisms with which to reinforce the 
payment ethics of the employers. The anticipated additional 
income is intended to raise the level of support and make the 
system of social security more efficient. 
  The government finds itself in a dilemma with which all 
transformation nations in Eastern Europe are being confronted. 
This refers to the target conflict between macroeconomic 
stabilization on the one hand, and battling social hardships on 
the other. Only in this way can broad acceptance of the 
market-economic reforms be achieved. Estonia has shown that 
despite the existing structural weaknesses, it has set out on a 
promising path in the direction of market economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Jorma Rotko: "In Paldiski, Estonia Everything Is </F>
the Way It Was in the Soviet Period"] 
  [Text] The buildings are dilapidated, the signs on 
storefronts are printed in Russian, and the selection of goods 
is meager. The Soviet Union is dead, but its ghost still walks. 
In the Paldiski base in Estonia it is still possible to become 
acquainted with genuine Soviet goings-on, since neither 
Gorbachev's perestroyka nor Yeltsin's edicts have penetrated 
there. 
  The Estonians have attempted to push their own 
administration 
into the region, but the city continues to be ruled by a city 
council of a kind that has ceased to exist in Russia. Passports 
are issued and cars registered by a body called the Paldiski 
Branch Office of the Leningrad Militia. 
<H5>  Change in the Landscape </H5>
  Estonia's economy has developed rapidly, and this is visible 
in the exterior appearance of cities and villages. This makes 
the change in landscape when one drives to Paldiski all the 
greater. 
  Everything is the way it was in the Soviet period. The 
buildings are gray and dilapidated. The signs on the store 
fronts are written in Russian, and the selection of goods is 
meager in contrast to the rest of Estonia, where one can obtain 
everything now. 
  On the city's main street there is a pothole that could 
swallow a car, and traffic is routed around it on the sidewalk. 
Telephones operate sporadically or not at all. 
  There were local elections in Estonia last fall, but they 
could not be held in Paldiski, because a list of eligible voters 
was not prepared for the city. The Russian militia did not agree 
to hand over a list of the city's residents, and now it has 
become clear that they did not have a proper list. 
  Last week some kind of document on which was recorded the 
number of persons moving to Paldiski and departing from there in 
the course of the years was handed over to the Estonian police. 
There is no information about the actual number of residents in 
Paldiski. 
  The city council continues its existence as if nothing had 
happened. It distributes apartments to those who need them and 
issues administrative regulations without paying much attention 
to Estonian opinions about what should be done in the city. 
Recently the Estonian Government made Paldiski a city district 
of the neighboring city Keila, so that Paldiski could have some 
kind of Estonian administration. For the time being this has had 
no effect at all on the course of life in the city. 
  In negotiations between the Estonians and Russians, the 
register for Paldiski's motor vehicles was promised to the 
Estonians, but the Russian militia has not handed it over but 
rather has proposed that the register be made one issue in the 
negotiations between Estonia and Russia. 
<H5>  A Paradise for Car Thieves </H5>
  It is an open secret in Estonia that many stolen cars are 
taken to Paldiski. The Russian militia registers the cars in the 
Russian car register, and the papers are in order. 
  Junior Inspector Agu Mitt of the Estonian police force, who 
works in Paldiski, reports that previously cars were taken to 
Russia on naval vessels. 
  "The stolen cars were hidden in the deserted missile bunkers 
in Paldiski, for example. When a naval transport ship arrived in 
the harbor, the cars were driven onto the ship in the dark of 
the night. I myself traced a new Mercedes 600, but it managed to 
drive onto a ship, and nothing could be done. The Estonian 
police are still too weak to dare to raid a great power's naval 
vessel." 
  Agu Mitt said that two kinds of cars are taken to Russia. 
Either a Lada or a brand-new Western car is stolen. Old Western 
cars are not suitable in Russia, because spare parts for them 
cannot be obtained there. 
  Last year over 1,000 cars vanished without a trace in 
Estonia, and the police are certain that they were exported to 
Russia, often through Paldiski. Several insurance companies no 
longer sell theft insurance for new Western cars. 
  Since the Paldiski administration is in a state of 
confusion, 
the city has become a favorite hiding place for the Russian 
mafia. There is no address registration, so that professional 
criminals fall into the clutches of the police only by chance. 
  Agu Mitt reported that one arrested criminal was taken by 
force from the Estonian police station in Paldiski. 
  "During the night 20 armed Russians rushed in at a time when 
there was only one man on duty. Of course he could have cut 
loose with an automatic weapon, but this would have created 
havoc, and the consequence would have been a political conflict. 
Thus there was nothing to be done but let the man go." 
<H5>  Population Does Not Decline </H5>
  About 200 Estonians and about 7,000 Russians live in 
Paldiski. Although the naval base has already been shut down 
with the exception of the submarine training center, the city's 
population has not declined. The thing is that the Russians have 
not shipped the officers out of Paldiski but rather they have 
remained there to live as "pensioners." 
  The temptation to participate in criminal operations is 
great, since the pension paid by Russia is only 600 kroons (280 
markka) per month. 
  With the exception of the nuclear reactor building and the 
submarine training center, the military sites in Paldiski are in 
rundown condition. All possible metal, including the metal roofs 
of buildings, has been plundered to be sold. 
  The Russian demand that Estonia compensate Russia for the 
money that Russia invested in the buildings in the past has 
aroused irritation in Estonia. "When you go, take with you the 
rubbish that is left."

<F P=106> [Interview of Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs by Valdis </F>
Bekeris: "`The Budget is the Nation's Policy in Figures...'"] 
  [Text] 
  [Bekeris] You agreed to this interview, Mr. Prime Minister, 
a 
few days after the Latvian government basketball team decisively 
defeated a Lithuanian team of no lesser standing. 
  [Birkavs] Yes, this victory places upon us the 
responsibility 
of seriously preparing for the next meeting, for the Lithuanian 
government anticipates holding this next sports meeting in 
Kaunas, in the famous arena where the "Zalgiris" team normally 
plays before five thousand spectators. In addition, the head of 
the Lithuanian government said that they will now begin serious 
training. If we are talking about the significance of the recent 
game, then, it seems to me, it very much strengthened our 
informal contacts with the Lithuanian government. 
  [Bekeris] How did you do personally in this game? 
  [Birkavs] I didn't even notice how quickly I received the 
five personal fouls. But I had the honor of tossing in the 
second and third baskets in the beginning. Then the [Economics 
Minister Ojars] Kehris and [Internal Affairs Minister Girts] 
Kristovskis offensive started. 
  [Bekeris] In your New Years speech, heard by all the people, 
you picturesquely spoke of, cited, "the golden sands of the 
economy, which will not pour into our own hands because they are 
found in the bottom half of our hour glass. The structure of the 
national economy must be turned to its proper position so that 
the sands can pour into Latvia's granaries." The new year, as 
they say, is moving along, but the old one leaves its own 
legacy. What is that? 
  [Birkavs] Perhaps, examining it superficially, it appears 
that nothing in particular is happening with the economy. But in 
reality we already in the previous year have put in place and 
also this year are putting into place, the foundation that will 
will permit the economy to recover. Statistics indisputably show 
that this process has begun. Of course, it has not been as rapid 
as we would like, not as grand, and yet the volume of production 
grows larger and the consumer price index confirms that this 
recovery process also influences prices. In principle, the 
process to a greater or lesser degree happens in accordance with 
our projections. What sorts of tasks must the government 
complete this year? We must reduce interest rates on loans, 
although in regard to this a completely clear future is not 
apparent. The privatization process must be sped up. I hope that 
the package of bills will be adopted immediately. It will speed 
up this process even more and provide the opportunity to 
restructure production. That is why there is a basis for the 
economic projection of five percent growth in total production. 
That is a significant indicator, but it is "large" only because 
we have "fallen greatly". This year Latvia will receive the most 
investment in Eastern Europe: a total of $600 million. Other 
investments will accompany this. The conditions which were 
placed on all investments are skillful and economical 
utilization of our local human resources and factories. 
Therefore the determining factors for economic recovery are 
investment, privatization, and a decline in borrower interest 
rates. In the future they will be the steps that will turn the 
structure of the economy in the right direction. 
  [Bekeris] The Saeima has passed on its first reading the 
government's budget proposal. But if this proposal is thrown out 
or derailed.... 
  [Birkavs] Even the strongest structure can be derailed, but 
this budget is still not the "strongest structure." It is only 
balancing the fragile. In the course of discussions a whole 
range of emphases appeared, quite essential supplements and also 
new priorities, including defense policy, which require greater 
financing than we had anticipated. Therefore everything depends 
on how precisely we will be able to work these new demands into 
the budget by the second reading. I do not think that it is 
possible to improve the budget significantly. We have maximal%w 
increased revenues, maximally sought to balance the budget's 
social part with expenditures.... The vote on child subsidies 
placed an immense supplemental load on the CM [Cabinet of 
Ministers]. In fact it will not resolve the problems of the 
"poorest," but more likely of the "most prosperous." Still, we 
have found an option, putting forth an amendment to resolve this 
problem. Indexing pensions also requires supplemental 
expenditures. That is why we must carry out some very difficult 
jobs by the second reading, and I hope that we will succeed in 
establishing an economic structure which the Saeima will not be 
able to destroy. 
  [Bekeris] Would the complete rejection of the budget 
proposal 
threaten the resignation of the government? 
  [Birkavs] I passed Mr. Kirsteins on my way back to my seat, 
after I gave my "budget speech," which I closed by saying that 
by not accepting it the Saeima invokes Article 7 of the Cabinet 
of Ministers system: an expression of no confidence in the 
government. Mr. Kirsteins said to me, "But that could not happen 
on the first reading. We must wait for the second." 
  In essence we announced the budget policy with the first 
reading. With the second reading of the budget, if it is amended 
to the point that it no longer corresponds to government policy, 
if it is "harmonized" so that it no longer corresponds to our 
priorities, then I will simply resign. But it would be much 
easier for me to resign, and I have emphasized it many times, if 
our opposition had drafted an alternative budget. Then I would 
have a clear conscience, for I would know who was coming after 
me and with what sort of political outlook. Right now I will do 
everything so that the budget is adopted and the government's 
priorities are accepted, and therefore I will not resign. But, 
if this budget is voted down, then, as I already said, Article 7 
will go into effect and my "easy life" will begin. 
  [Bekeris] The previous government was not threatened with 
this "easy life." 
  [Birkavs] No. In no way. We worked out that article 
ourselves. The Cabinet of Ministers discussed this rule, for the 
budget is the government's and the nation's policy in figures. 
  [Bekeris] What have been the consequences of the 
"significant" new year's date, the events of 10 January? Did 
Vidzeme borough council chairman Andrejs Rucs really cause a 
crisis situation? And another related question about this 
situation, which was predicted to have far-reaching 
consequences: Why was Supreme Court chairman Gvido Zemribo the 
first to react with his statement, rather than the government? 
  [Birkavs] I think the the government reaction was 
sufficiently active, clear and unambiguous. I must say candidly 
that the world has evaluated it positively. That is also 
discernable from the side of Russia, for our bilateral 
negotiations have not been interrupted. But still, we 
encountered two impediments right after these events. That is 
the Northwestern Army Group's declaration about shooting if 
their installations are threatened, and Russian Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev's declaration that the Baltic states belong within 
"their" sphere of interest. Even if we ignore the later 
retraction of this declaration, we must be extraordinarily 
careful and capable in our actions. Our capacity for action 
became clear even before Kozyrev's declaration: We announced 
that national security is our priority number one. The actions 
of Rucs were the catalyst and to a large extent laid bare the 
situation. It threw us back considerably in our negotiations 
with Russia, significantly limiting our ability to maneuver in 
these negotiations. I must say that although Rucs demonstrated 
completely apolitical action, it still expressed that popular 
desire, to wit, that it is high time for the Russian army to 
leave. There can be no more procrastinating, for the coatrack is 
full and patience is almost at an end. 
  [Bekeris] The Vidzeme borough municipal deputies corps has 
demanded that Rucs be allowed to return to his former position. 
  [Birkavs] I would not want to read tea leaves. Rubiks was 
elected to the Saeima, Siegerist was elected. The viewpoint of 
the public is a sacred thing. If there is no legal hurdle, of 
course, Mr. Rucs will be able to return to his former post. But 
I think that this event illuminates for us also the necessity 
for regulating relations between municipalities and the 
government more precisely, for until now the status of municipal 
deputies has been higher than the status of Saeima deputies. If 
a Saeima deputy has committed an offense, he can immediately be 
detained, but municipal deputies may not be. I do not assume 
that deputies are criminally inclined, but offenses as such 
create an exclusive situation in which it is necessary to act. 
This kind of situation must be precisely reflected in law. 
  [Bekeris] The Russian Foreign Minister's declaration has 
been 
heard throughout the world. After it was made the thoughts were 
expressed that it was incorrectly understood and translated. Did 
you perceive it in the same way? 
  [Birkavs] Nothing was misunderstood. That is Kozyrev's 
style: 
First to express himself very strongly, then to turn around 
completely, see what the reaction will be, and after that to 
say, 'I was not even thinking that.' Let's remember his 
Stockholm speech. In essence it was a professional overture, how 
far can Russia permit herself to go in her statements and 
actions, especially after the meeting between Clinton and 
Yeltsin. There were no misunderstandings or inadvertant word 
games, but rather a deliberate action by Kozyrev to explain what 
the reaction will be. 
  [Bekeris] What, in your opinion, is the status of the 
Latvian 
army? Can this force be viewed as a guarantor of national 
security? 
  [Birkavs] The guarantor of Latvia's independence and 
security 
are the Latvian people themselves. The Army only carries out 
certain functions in order to enforce this guarantee with 
weapons in hand. Today (21 January) I had my regular meeting 
with Defense Force leaders. We must seriously turn to defense 
questions so that with minimal resources we can acquire a 
maximally organized and battle ready defense system. People must 
have faith in the army and must feel secure. I must admit that 
until now we really have not addressed the army's problems--I 
will not mince my words--we have neglected them. If security 
becomes priority number one, then we must guarantee normal 
supplies of weapons and ammunition for the army. But we cannot 
become involved in some sort of arms race which would leave us 
naked and impoverished. We must evaluate our options, but we 
cannot pursue them at the cost of the educational, cultural or 
social spheres. 
  [Bekeris] How has the situation with the intelligence 
services developed? The veil of ignorance and secrecy 
surrounding them gives rise to malicious rumors and gossip. 
  [Birkavs] The situation with the intelligence services is 
unsatisfactory. I think that that will not continue for long. 
The Cabinet of Ministers has prepared a restructuring program 
for the intelligence services. The new order will bring all of 
these systems into mutual harmony. Each worker will receive 
precise, certain duties. Everything will be done so that the 
country is better supplied with information, timely analysis and 
everything else that is necessary for her security. The Cabinet 
of Ministers adopted article 81 of the counter-intelligence 
rules, which the Saeima did not accept. Therefore the government 
will put forth an initiative asking that the Saeima accept them 
on an urgent basis, for the rules heretofore do not satisfy me 
personally. 
  [Bekeris] Will we soon be able to produce goods, both 
manufactured and agricultural goods, marked "Made in Latvia" for 
the world market and really ensure coverage of the lats? Right 
now there is talk of a stable lats being an illusion, 
emphasizing that the lats is competing with the dollar in an 
uneven battle, unsuccessfully seeking to conquer stable foreign 
currency. 
  [Birkavs] Latvian goods will never make it to the world 
market if they are oriented only toward the Eastern market. On 
the other hand, if these goods are oriented toward that sphere 
which in which it is very difficult to compete right now, toward 
the Western market, then they will always be able to compete in 
Russia's market also. That is why, it seems to me, we must think 
about what direction we want our economy moving in. We can go to 
the Eastern market, renewing our old economic connections and 
not especially renovating our technology. But let's take into 
account that there is no foreign capital in Russia either, and 
that that country too, with the free market regime Western goods 
are flooding in. This market is large, and within it also there 
stands a high capacity for competition. That is why it is better 
to orient ourselves to the West, but always, knowing that we can 
go to the East, it is not necessary to orient ourselves 
completely to this market. As pertains to the illusory stability 
of the lats.... Its actual stability will alway depend upon the 
[central] bank's economic monetary policy connection with all 
national economic policy. If monetary policy is just as isolated 
from national economic policy as it has been until now, then the 
stability of the lats may be threatened. But they may not 
interfere in administrative undertakings; in this well 
considered cooperation is essential. 
  [Bekeris] Did the rapid decline in production of 
manufactured 
goods and the accompanying unemployment, cause you to worry? 
  [Birkavs] Obviously the chief problem this year will be the 
increase in unemployment and the accompanying expenditures for 
retraining the unemployed. But it is better to invest money in 
unemployment benefits and training than to maintain enterprises 
which produce goods for warehouses and produce them for a higher 
price than anywhere else in the world. As enterprises go 
bankrupt and close the next action must immediately follow: New 
jobs must be created. Toward this end either private companies 
must take over the factories, or foreign investment must flood 
in, or the appropriate state policy must be implemented with 
investment. That is one of the heaviest issues which, I think, 
we will be able to resolve positively this year; utilizing 
domestic accumulation for investment. Currently we are chiefly 
financing future technological projects on the basis of foreign 
credits. Domestic investment reserves are small. 
  [Bekeris] The rate of inflation keeps going up. How long 
will 
that continue? 
  [Birkavs] Inflation has its own laws. After the introduction 
of the turnover tax the anticipated increase in the rate of 
inflation reached its maximum in December and November of last 
year. Now the prognosis is stronger: the rate has a tendency to 
slide downward. In relation to the increase in the turnover tax, 
I made this prognosis precisely at that time; the talk was of 
three or four months in which an increase in inflation was 
inescapable, which would worsen the economic situation. Just as 
inescapable is a further decrease in inflation and the 
stabilization of the situation. The appropriate economic policy 
is being maintained, as confirmed by international experience. 
  [Bekeris] The current bureaucracy is being critized. Under 
the influence of the law on civil service a new, and, we must 
hope, progressive and intelligent "bureaucratic apparatus" will 
be established. What are your thoughts about that? 
  [Birkavs] An interesting phenomenon can be observed: They 
strongly criticize the bureaucracy, but do not want to establish 
a new bureaucracy. I undoubtedly evaluate positively the new 
reform of the bureaucracy. That is one of our programmatic 
assignements: to bring order to the bureaucracy and train them. 
The new bureaucracy reform is receiving no small amount of 
criticism, but I am satisfied to a certain extent because 
currently the existing bureaucrats very fearful of these 
changes. I think that no honorable or forward-looking bureaucrat 
is afraid of the reform. I could argue over whether this 
bureaucratuc reform must occur at such a fast tempo. But 
bureaucracy is a basic element of every country's mechanism. It 
is important that bureaucrats serve the public. Right now we are 
all dissatisfied with the bureaucracy. That is why we should not 
be stingy with work and resources in this area. I do not see a 
different road. Right now many of the more capable and smarter 
people are leaving the bureaucracy, going to work for private 
companies. We cannot pay bureaucrats high salaries, but we can 
compensate for this work with the greatest demands of the 
bureaucracy, which are related to sufficient social guarantees. 
Thousands of people want to work securely, not to feel 
threatened, to serve the country, to serve the people. The law 
on the bureaucracy is vitally essential. 
  [Bekeris] The current bureaucracy is connected with bribe 
taking and bribe giving. I would like to mention another one of 
your public pronouncements, when your were speaking of a 
specific example of bribe giving. The state reform minister 
Maris Gailis became a sacrifice to that. But by starting with 
holding the bribe givers responsible, is not the corruption 
problem being resolved from the wrong end? They say that if 
there were no bribe takers, then bribe givers would not arise. 
Of course the reaction of Maris Gailis was sharp and dignified, 
as becomes a high-ranking official. 
  [Birkavs] Information about a person who takes bribes is 
broadcast rather quickly. They give to those who take, but they 
do not even make offers to those who do not take and they try to 
find alternative ways around them. The needed information about 
those "takers" disappear into the sand, for there is no one who 
will point a finger, 'See, this official takes bribes.' And only 
recently special operations have been carried out on the 
borders, where customs agents were arrested for taking a $2,500 
bribe, a concrete fact was demonstrated. Or in the Riga Central 
Market, when several security police workers were arrested for 
demanding bribes from illegal liquor sellers. Only when special 
operations are conducted or preparing a special professional 
provokation to catch a guilty one, then bribe givers or bribe 
takers can possibly be caught. In corruption both parties, the 
taker and the giver, are interested in hiding the crime. In 
these crimes the so-called likelihood is the highest. There are 
crimes in which both parties are interested in finding the 
criminals, let's say murder. Representatives of state justice 
protection services and the victim's loved ones are direclty 
interested in rapid, operational investigation of the crime. You 
will be more interested in the apprehension of a pickpocket if 
you are one of the victims, for the state's interest in these 
crimes is determined, if only because the police cannot cope 
with all the pickpockets. But crimes in which both parties are 
interested in hiding the transgression, such as bribe taking and 
taking, are the most difficult to investigate. The battle 
against corruption must be waged with special actions; those who 
carry it out must be given special rights and assignments. 
  [Bekeris] Are you still leading the Jurists Association of 
Latvia? 
  [Birkavs] Still. Although I have passed down my authority 
and 
given it over to the association's four vice presidents. But I 
have remained in this post formally and just recently I attended 
the association's five year anniversary party. I also 
participate in the association's council meetings. The 
Association of Lawyers is helping me greatly in terms of 
implementing the judicial reform by providing me with specific 
proposals. 
  [Bekeris] Doesn't the decreased financing of the justice 
system threaten their independence, and perhaps for that very 
reason it is difficult for it to lose its political coloring, to 
better carry out juridical, that is law enforcement duties? 
  [Birkavs] I do not want to agree that the justice system is 
melting away on account of financing. This year to this end we 
developed a financial foundation. Last year I personally 
obtained a salary increase for judges, which, because of 
inflation, unfortunately, was ineffective. Salaries in the 
procuracy were also increased, but we must acknowledge that it 
has all been insufficient. Now we are ensuring a judicial reform 
with a financial basis. Have the courts been politicized? In my 
opinion, this time has already receded into the past. Judges 
and, I hope, also all the other justice system institutions are 
depoliticized in point of fact. 
  [Bekeris] What sort of evaluation could you make as a lawyer 
of the actions of Justice Minister [Egils] Levits, when in his 
institution, in reducing its status, he nevertheless was forced, 
by a legal order, to rehire the laid-off workers into their 
previous posts? 
  [Birkavs] The answer to your previous question is hiding 
here. Notwithstanding that this was the Justice Minister, the 
court rehired the laid-off workers. This affair could also have 
been "approached politically." The court fulfilled its duty to 
the blind goddess of justice. 
  [Bekeris] How do you assess the activities of emigre 
Latvians 
who have returned to their homeland to work in responsible posts 
in the Latvian state? 
  [Birkavs] There can be no general analysis. All of the 
emigre 
Latvians cannot be measured on one criterion. Mr. Siegerist is 
also Latvian by ancestory. Everbody is different, more or less 
professional in their actions, every one of them has made their 
own path in life. And I think that they enrich our lives to a 
large extent with their worldly experience. I would not want to 
say that they are not needed here. These are people who are 
developing into a part of our people, who are Latvians just like 
us, only with a different education and life's experience. I 
would not permit myself to judge any of them as higher or lower. 
Under no circumstances would I distinguish the emigres over our 
own folks, who lived for so long "in the Soviet regime," or vice 
versa: distinguishing "our own" above "them." Everyone has their 
own individual shortcomings, pluses and minuses. In my opinion 
if someone is irresponsible in his position, then he must be 
relieved. A local can be just as irresponsible in his assigned 
post as can be an emigre Latvian. 
  [Bekeris] Still, the emigres do not have our real life 
insights. 
  [Birkavs] Of course. But now that they have arrived in the 
homeland they are beginning to have better insights, they are 
running into the same negations with which we "locals" grapple. 
But the fact that they perceive it differently enriches our 
mutual insights. 
  [Bekeris] What is your view of adoption of the citizenship 
law? Isn't it a sort of a frontier barrier, a trench which we 
move away and move away, fearing to take the fateful leap, for 
we might blunder, break a leg or, in the worst case, even the 
backbone? 
  [Birkavs] Your comparison is truly unique and graphic. Also 
not without basis. This jump could have been made long ago, 
without fear of anything. I had hoped that this law would be 
adopted last year. I still think that worries and the many 
arguments have a strong basis, for the talk is not merely of 
citizenship, but also about the fate of the nation. Two 
classical approaches are evident. The radical position, which is 
dominated by the survival and protection of the nation, and the 
second position, which is dominated by the development of the 
nation. This approach can be characterized by the prohibition, 
that nothing should be adopted. Or also that this law should be 
maximally narrowed. Truth is to be foundin the unification of 
the principles of national survival and national development. 
Now the first step has already been taken, to be followed by the 
second, third and fourth. Obviously there will be a referendum. 
  [Bekeris] Do contacts between the Prime Minister and the 
President continue to be good? Mr. Ulmanis emphasized the 
significance of understanding in his New Year's interview with 
RIGAS BALSS. 
  [Birkavs] I think that we have an understanding. In my view 
the chief assignment from my side is to ensure stability. 
Understanding from one side, stability from the other; that 
would the most important thing. 
  [Bekeris] Does your mutual relationship also include 
arguments? 
  [Birkavs] I haven't noticed any real arguments. But, taking 
into account that the institution of the Presidency is renewed 
and new, on many ocassions there arises the necessity to meet, 
not to resolve misunderstandings, but to make more precise our 
actions in conformance with the Constitution. We each see common 
goals from our own positions. Here arises that prerogative, if 
the President emphasizes a question of understanding, then I, as 
the Prime Minister, with the executive agencies must ensure this 
understanding. 
  [Bekeris] How do you evaluate the press? What is your 
attitude toward "angry" journalists, who often are accused also 
of destructive activities? 
  [Birkavs] I think that words must be free, but words may not 
destroy the state. And, if this boundary is transgressed, then I 
would like to work very actively. 
  [Bekeris] And again, Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to 
hold 
you to your words, which you have spoken publicly. Specifically, 
that journalist who is able to offend you in the press will be 
granted an award from your personal salary. Does this promise 
provide proof of the distinguished self-critical abilities, or 
also do you as a person feel that your unconqerable sense of 
humor is being trampled down? 
  [Birkavs] My colleagues warned me that journalists may now 
begin a contest to make me look as black as they can. But I bear 
no ill will either toward people or journalists. I assess people 
according to their material qualities and according to what 
orients them. If people are oriented toward evil, then action 
must be taken. If people are writing malicious things because of 
lack of understanding, then we must talk to them and explain 
things. If they are mistaken, then they must be forgiven. But, 
if they, in doing their jobs, strive and make my nose appear 
bigger than it is, then that is really nothing, so why should I 
be angry with it? 
  [Bekeris] How do you evaluate the judicial process, where we 
have cases of insulting honor and reputation, and the 
publication is the defendant? 
  [Birkavs] The most recent information I have received is 
that 
the journalist Gailums was fined 1,000 lats. I thought to 
myself, first of all, where will Gailums get that kind of money? 
And the second thing that came to mind, doesn't this judgment 
muzzle journalists? And such a situation could be much more 
significant than the material difficulties that have been 
applied to Gailums. We must establish normal relations between 
the press and the courts. That is a fine matter. The freedom of 
the press is absolutely necessary in a normal country. There are 
a few signals that bother me a bit. What is the journalists own 
responsibilities regarding the information he disseminates? For 
what and where should be held responsible? Those are the nuances 
which in conditions of a lasting free press are polished 
filigree, but we have not done that. 
  As we end our discussion, I will use the opportunity in this 
first month of the new year to wish the readers of RIGAS BALSS 
that they not lose their optimism, for optimism is the 
foundation. 
  [Bekeris] Thank you.

<F P=106> ["Regulations" under the rubric "In the Cabinet of Ministers </F>
of the Latvian Republic," "No. 29 (Protocol No. 4, #22), Riga, 
dated 11 January 1994: 'On the State Border of the Latvian 
Republic', Issued in Accordance with Procedure Prescribed by 
Article 81 of the Satversme"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Section 1. General Provisions </H5>
  Article 1. State Border of the Latvian Republic 
  The state border of the Latvian Republic (henceforth in this 
text--"State Border") is the line and vertical plane coinciding 
with this line which separates the land and water territory of 
the Latvian Republic, its subsurface depths, and its airspace, 
from neighboring states and the neutral waters of the Baltic Sea. 
  Article 2. Determination of the State Border and 
Provision for Its Defense 
  The State Border is defined by bilateral agreements and 
ratified interstate treaties concluded by the Latvian Republic 
prior to 16 June 1940, and also by bilateral agreements 
concluded later with neighboring states on the restoration or 
designation of borders. 
  In places where the State Border does not conform to 
interstate treaties concluded prior to 16 June 1940, it is 
considered a temporary line of demarcation until conclusion of a 
new interstate treaty. All norms included in this regulation 
which have entered into force with respect to the State Border 
are applicable to such a line of demarcation. 
  The Cabinet of Ministers undertakes measures within the 
framework of its authority to defend the State Border and the 
territory of the country. 
  Article 3. Designation of the State Border 
  Unless otherwise prescribed by an interstate treaty 
concluded 
by the Latvian Republic, the State Border is designated as 
follows: 
  1) on land--by characteristic terrain features and clearly 
discernible reference points; 
  2) in the Baltic Sea--by the outer limit of Latvian Republic 
territorial waters; 
  3) in the Irves Strait and Gulf of Riga--in accordance with 
bilateral agreements with the Estonian Republic; 
  4) on navigable rivers--along the river's main channel; on 
nonnavigable rivers (streams)--along their centerline or center 
of the main fluvial branch; on lakes and other bodies of 
water--along a straight line connecting two points at which the 
State Border emerges on the shore of the given lake or other 
body of water. 
  When passing along a river, stream, lake, or other body of 
water, the State Border does not change when the configuration 
of the shores of the body of water changes, or when a river 
(stream) changes its course; 
  5) on bridges and other structures that intersect border 
sections designated over water--along the centerline of these 
bridges and structures, or along their technological axis. 
  The State Border is designated on terrain by clearly 
distinguishable border markers, whose form, size, and 
installation procedure are determined by the Cabinet of 
Ministers based on interstate treaties. 
  Article 4. Territorial Waters of the Latvian 
Republic 
  Territorial waters of the Latvian Republic are the waters of 
the Baltic Sea extending a distance of 12 nautical miles from 
the line of maximum ebb tide along the Latvian shore (with the 
exception of the Irves Strait and Gulf of Riga). 
  Article 5. Internal Waters of the Latvian Republic 
  The following constitute the internal waters of the Latvian 
Republic: 
  1) the waters of ports of the Latvian Republic, bounded by a 
straight line connecting those point locations of hydrotechnical 
or other structures situated on opposite sides of a particular 
port, which project the farthest towards the sea; 
  2) in the Irves Strait and Gulf of Riga--the waters bounded 
by a line which connects the base line passing through the 
southern part of the Cape Lode cliff and the center of Cape 
Ovishrags. The Irves Strait and Gulf of Riga are the common 
internal waters of the Latvian Republic and Estonian Republic. 
The configuration of the State Border in the waters of the Gulf 
of Riga is determined by interstate treaty between the Latvian 
Republic and the Estonian Republic; 
  3) the waters of those rivers, lakes, and other bodies of 
water whose shores belong entirely to the Latvian Republic. 
<H3>  Section 2. Operating Regime of the State Border and Border 
Zone </H3>
  Article 6. Operating Regime of the State Border 
  The Operating Regime of the State Border: 
  1) determines the procedure for maintenance, security, and 
crossing of the border, determines procedure for entry, 
presence, and performance of work in the border strip, and in 
border rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water of the Latvian 
Republic, and determines the control procedures for compliance 
with such; 
  2) determines the procedure according to which aircraft and 
other flying objects cross the airspace of the State Border; 
  3) at the maritime border, determines the procedure 
according 
to which surface platforms may enter or be present in the 
territorial and internal waters and ports of the Latvian 
Republic. 
  The Operating Regime of the State Border is regulated by 
these regulations, legislative acts of the Latvian Republic, and 
interstate treaties concluded by the Latvian Republic. 
  Article 7. The State Border Strip 
  With the aim of ensuring proper order on the State Border, 
the State Border Strip is established along the State Border. 
The State Border Strip is a strip of land of predetermined width 
adjoining the State Border, in which the Operating Regime of the 
State Border is exercised. The State Border Strip is determined 
by the Cabinet of Ministers in accordance with interstate 
treaties that have been concluded. 
  Article 8. Crossing the State Border 
  All types of communications and dislocation across the State 
Border are effected at border crossing locations determined by

  Seagoing and river vessels, naval warships, and other 
surface 
platforms cross the State Border in accordance with legislative 
acts and regulations of the Latvian Republic which have been 
published according to established procedure. 
  Aircraft and other flying objects cross the State Border 
through specially determined air corridors in accordance with 
legislative acts and regulations of the Latvian Republic which 
have been published according to established procedure. 
  Crossings are permitted outside the boundaries of these air 
corridors only upon authorization of the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  Article 9. Take-Off and Landing of Aircraft and Other 
Flying Objects 
  Aircraft and other flying objects take off from the Latvian 
Republic and land upon arrival in the Latvian Republic only at 
airports and airfields prescribed for international flights, 
which incorporate border control stations. 
  Procedure for take-off and landing is determined, and 
changes 
made thereto, by the Cabinet of Ministers and its subordinate 
structures. 
  If a forced landing is necessitated, aircraft and other 
flying objects may effect emergency landing at other airports 
and airfields that do not have border control stations. 
  Article 10. Procedure for Visits of Foreign Vessels and 
Other Surface Platforms in the Territorial and Internal Waters 
of the Latvian Republic and Port Calls at Latvian Ports, and 
Procedure for Their Departure 
  Any foreign ship has the right to enter the territorial 
waters of the Latvian Republic for the purpose of crossing 
without entering internal waters, of entering internal waters or 
ports, and of heading out to the open sea, observing the 
principle of nonstop peaceful passage. 
  Foreign naval warships may enter the territorial waters of 
the Latvian Republic in accordance with procedure determined by 
the Cabinet of Ministers. Foreign submarines may be located in 
the territorial waters of the Latvian Republic only in the 
surface mode and flying the flag that indicates their state. 
  Visits by foreign ships and other surface platforms and 
their 
presence in the territorial waters, roadsteads, and ports of the 
Latvian Republic are effected in accordance with procedure as 
determined by resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers and 
international treaties. 
  Article 11. Control of Crossings of the State

other property crossing the State Border are subject to border 
crossing control in accordance with these regulations, 
legislative acts of the Latvian Republic, and international 
treaties concluded by the Latvian Republic. 
  Control of State Border crossings is exercised at border 
control stations and border crossing points established by the 
Cabinet of Ministers and state treaties. 
  Border control at border control stations is carried out by 
border guards and customs agents. Medical quarantine, 
veterinary, plant quarantine, and other control is also effected 
at border control stations if necessary, as well as control of 
the removal of cultural treasures. 
  Border control at border crossing points is carried out by 
border guards only. Persons and means of transportation have the 
right to cross the State Border at these points in accordance 
with procedure determined by the Cabinet of Ministers and 
interstate treaties. 
  Article 12. Passage of Persons, Means of 
Transportation, Freight, and Other Property Across the State 
Border 
  Persons, means of transportation, freight, and other 
property 
are granted passage across the State Border by Border Security 
Forces when properly drawn up documents are presented affording 
the right to cross the State Border. 
  Article 13. Operating Regime of Border Control 
Stations 
  In order to establish and maintain necessary conditions for 
the activity of border control stations related to the passage 
of persons, means of transportation, freight, and other property 
across the State Border, an operating regime is instituted at 
these border control stations regulating the procedure by which 
persons and means of transportation are held and transferred and 
other activity is carried out related to the passage of persons, 
means of transportation, freight, and other property across the 
State Border. 
  The operating regime of border control stations is 
established by the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  Border Security Forces at border control stations determine 
the premises and territory in which border control is effected. 
To prevent access by unauthorized persons to border control 
areas and means of transportation crossing the State Border, 
Border Security Forces may stipulate additional regulations with 
respect to the operating regime of these premises and 
territories. 
  The operating regime of the border control station extends 
to 
the entire territory of the regime of the transportation 
establishment (airport, seaport, railroad passenger terminal, 
seaport terminal, etc.). 
  Ensuring compliance with the operating regime of the border 
control station is the mission of the Border Security Forces 
jointly with the administrations of international seaports, 
airports, and railroad stations, and with cooperation from the 
police and Home Guard. Decisions of the Border Security Forces 
are determinate in this cooperative effort.

rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water of the Latvian Republic, 
in violation of procedure for crossing the State Border; 
  4) aircraft and other flying objects that cross the State 
Border without appropriate authorization or otherwise violate 
the regulations for crossing the State Border. 
  Crossing the State Border is not recognized as unlawful if 
the crossing takes place by mistake or under pressure (in the 
event of an accident, natural calamity, or breakdown), if the 
crew (passengers) of a vessel, aircraft, or other means of 
transport are threatened by danger, or if such crossing is 
necessary to convey rescued persons or render urgent medical aid. 
  Article 17. Authorized Representatives of the Latvian 
Republic Border 
  In order to resolve issues related to maintaining the Regime 
of the State Border and to manage border incidents, the Cabinet 
of Ministers appoints authorized representatives of the Latvian

  Article 19. Regime of the Border Zone and the Airspace 
Above It. Regime of the Border Strip 
  Depending on political, economic, and ecological 
circumstances, on the crime situation, population density, and 
other factors, the Cabinet of Ministers may establish in the 
border zone and airspace above it an appropriate regime of the 
border zone and airspace above it. 
  In the security interests of the Latvian Republic, the 
Cabinet of Ministers may stipulate additional regulations with

Border are established by the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  Article 28. The Air Force has the right: 
  1) to exercise control of the airspace, and engage other 
state institutions in clarification of the situation and 
identification of aircraft in the airspace of the state; 
  2) in instances where danger of illegal crossing of the 
State 
Border arises, to prohibit or restrict aircraft flights in 
certain regions of the state's airspace; 
  3) to demand that crews of aircraft illegally crossing the 
State Border land their aircraft in the territory of the Latvian 
Republic to explain the circumstances and reasons behind the 
illegal crossing of the State Border. 
  Article 29. Use of Physical Force, Dogs, and Special 
Means for Security of the State Border 
  The Border Security Forces have the right, in the execution 
of their official duties, to use physical force, special means 
(handcuffs, billy clubs, electric shock devices, tear gas, 
chemical paralysis-inducing substances, means of halting 
transportation, etc.), and dogs, with the aim of: 
  1) repulsing an attack upon border guards or other persons 
executing their duties on the State Border; 
  2) detaining violators of the law who maliciously refuse to 
subordinate themselves to border security personnel or who put 
up resistance; 
  3) repulsing attacks against buildings, individual premises, 
and means of transportation under the guard of border security 
personnel, and liberating these facilities in the event they 
become occupied by armed individuals. 
  Prior to the use of physical force or special means, a 
person 
(persons) must be warned of the intent to use such, except in 
instances where delay in the use of physical force or special 
means would cause a direct threat to the health or lives of 
border security personnel or could entail other grave 
consequences, or if such warning is impossible in the particular 
situation. 
  The type of special means used is determined by the nature 
of 
the physical violation and the particular individual features of 
the violator. When special means are used, it is necessary to 
limit the damage caused by these means to the maximum extent 
possible, and to ensure that medical assistance is rendered to 
victims when necessary. 
  If as a result of the use of physical force or special 
means, 
an individual sustains injury or dies, the border guard involved 
is obliged to so inform his immediate superior at once. The 
latter then conveys this information to the procurator of the 
district in question. 
  It is prohibited to use fighting (combat) techniques, 
handcuffs, billy clubs, electric shock devices, tear gas, 
chemical paralysis-inducing substances, or dogs against women, 
persons with evident injuries or disabilities, or minors, except 
in instances where their actions threaten the health of other 
persons and where they put up physical resistance. 
  Procedure for the storage, carrying, and use of special 
means 
is prescribed by directive of the Ministry of Defense. 
  Article 30. Use of Firearms in Security of the State 
Border 
  Shoot to kill is acknowledged as the technique of 
application 
of firearms in security of the State Border. 
  Military servicemen of the Border Security Forces have the 
right to retain and carry a service firearm on a permanent 
basis. Procedure for retaining and carrying firearms at their 
disposal is determined by directive of the Ministry of Defense. 
  A military serviceman of the Border Security Forces is 
authorized to use his firearm with the aim of: 
  1) repulsing armed attack against the territory of the 
Latvian Republic or terminating the armed resistance of 
attackers; 
  2) arresting a violator of the State Border in the absence 
of 
other ability to detain him; 
  3) repulsing attack and terminating resistance, including on 
the part of unarmed individuals, if a real danger threatens the 
lives of border security personnel or other persons and it is 
impossible to avert this danger by other means, and also with 
the aim of preventing attempts to forcefully gain possession of 
his firearm; 
  4) detaining a means of transportation by inflicting damage 
against it, if the driver is creating a real threat to the lives 
and health of the border guard or other persons by virtue of his 
actions and is not responding to the demands of the serviceman 
to stop the means of transportation, and if there is no other 
way of detaining it. 
  A military serviceman of the Border Security Forces has the 
right to use his firearm to signal distress or to summon 
assistance. 
  The use of firearms is prohibited: 
  1) against women, persons with evident injuries or 
disabilities, and minors, except in instances where their 
actions threaten the lives of other persons, when they are 
putting up armed resistance, and when they are carrying out an 
armed attack; 
  2) in instances where other persons may be injured as a 
result of their use.

has taken the oath as a military serviceman of the Latvian 
Republic, has passed a course of special border security 
training, occupies a certain position in the Border Security 
Forces, and has a military rank. 
  Article 32. Recruitment in the Border Security 
Forces 
  Recruitment for the Border Security Forces is effected from 
among citizens of the Latvian Republic in accordance with the 
Law "On Defense of the State." 
  A border guard must have mastery of the state language and 
be 
able to communicate with the populace in the language of primary 
use in the region of assignment. 
  Article 33. Responsibility of the Border Guard 
  A border guard bears responsibility for unlawful actions in

<F P=106> [Article by Lidija Sabajevaite: "Who Usurped Radio and </F>
Television?"] 
  [Text] No matter the occasion--whether it's from the Seimas 
rostrum, or in the press, or at get-togethers--those on the 
right are complaining that they do not have an opportunity to 
express their opinion on the radio or television. 
Simultaneously, the LDDP is accused of having usurped the 
aforementioned means of information and of implementing a Soviet 
era policy, when there was one set of speakers and one truth. 
  So that we might better comprehend those on the right, let's 
return to the recent past. From the very moment that the 
independence of our state was restored, they had unlimited 
opportunities for presenting information. The right of all 
representatives of the national government to have precedence in 
using Lithuanian Radio and Television on issues pertaining to 
their duties was fixed in article 6 of the Charter for 
Lithuanian Radio and Television. This is why we watched 
"Atgimimo banga" ["Wave of Rebirth"] each week, which was 
gradually converted into a platform for government 
representatives from the right side of the political spectrum; 
on many an evening we listened to the speeches of always the 
same politicians. Television acquired its "talking heads" 
appellation. 
  Representatives on the left side of the political spectrum, 
who made up an insignificant minority in the Supreme Council, 
were unable to make use of the Article 6 right. They were 
chastised as "enemies" by the "patriots", so it was not 
permissible for the people to remember that they existed. 
Besides that, all the air time was divided up among "one's own". 
  After the relationship of political forces in the government 
changed in the wake of the Seimas elections, the Radio and 
Television Board proposed relinquishing Article 6. Since this 
elicited tempestuous dissatisfaction on the part of the right, 
the Seimas education committee made the decision to give each 
political party air time proportionate to the number of members 
it had in the Seimas. The right, which had initially concurred, 
later reconsidered and abandoned this proposal, demanding that 
the opposition be assigned a special weekly slot of air time. 
Then the majority of Seimas members supported the Radio and 
Television Board proposal not to allot special slots to any 
political party, nor to the opposition or the government. 
  Does the fact that neither side has its own program mean--in 
the words of those on the right--that the LDDP has usurped the 
radio and television? 
  People of various political persuasions work on the Radio 
and 
Television Board, but most of them do not belong to political 
parties. Does the presence of 2 LDDP representatives and 1 
social democrat in a body of 16 members really constitute 
domination by the left? 
  According to the Radio and Television Charter, the board 
establishes the political and cultural strategy for broadcasts 
(II. sec. 9.4.). The representatives of the right, e.g., S. 
Saltenis, N. Ozelyte, V. Landsbergis, and others criticize the 
board's work, accusing it of inaction, lack of national topics, 
etc. It may be that the board is not sufficiently active, but 
that is the fault of its own members, one of whom is N. Ozelyte. 
I also do not like all the broadcasts that are on television and 
radio; however, I believe that those responsible for the poor 
work are the specific people who prepare those broadcasts. 
  How much and what kind of political information is presented 
is a different matter. It is perhaps possible to say that the 
broadcast programs confine themselves to quite narrow 
commentaries. In addition, those invited to comment are people 
whose opinions on most issues have been known for a long time. 
What is missing are some markedly more diverse opinions, 
educated dispute, and most importantly, serious and objective 
analysis of political events. This I believe is essential, 
because it would help people orient themselves with respect to 
rather complex international as well as domestic events. There 
are enough qualified political scientists in Lithuania, who, if 
invited to appear on radio or television, could help form the 
country's political culture. 
  Do the representatives of political parties or the 
opposition 
have absolutely no opportunity to use the radio and the 
television? 
  In listening to daily radio programs, e.g. "Aktualijos" 
["Topical Issues"], one can almost always hear the voices of 
well-known politicians from the right. There has never been an 
instance when only representatives of the left talked about 
political events on the informational television broadcasts, 
especially on the program "Naujienos. Nuomones" ["News and 
Opinions"]. We also see representatives of both sides on special 
political broadcasts. 
  It is possible, of course, to understand the annoyance of 
active politicians from the right, since they can't make use of 
state television in the same way that they make use of the 
"Tele-3" studio. But those on the left should be even more 
disappointed, because they have to be content with only the 
attention of journalists from state television. 
  Therefore, assertions that the LDDP has usurped radio and 
television are fabricated. If we were to consider it usurping 
that we frequently see the president and the prime minister on 
our television screens, then we would also have to term as 
usurpers of our television the heads of other countries, who are 
shown during the overview of international events.

<F P=106> [Interview with S. Saltenis, new chief editor of LIETUVOS </F>
AIDAS, by Kestutis Simonavicius; place and date not given: "`I 
Ended Up Here Very Unexpectedly', Says Seimas Member Who Has 
Become the New Head of LIETUVOS AIDAS"] 
  [Text] LIETUVOS RYTAS has already written about the changes 
on the LIETUVOS AIDAS editorial staff and has published an 
interview with S. Stoma, who was recently released from his 
duties as chief editor of that daily newspaper. Today we present 
an interview with S. Saltenis, the new chief editor of LIETUVOS 
AIDAS. 
  [Simonavicius] Will LIETUVOS AIDAS change now that there is 
a 
new chief editor? 
  [Saltenis] You'll be able to judge by reading LIETUVOS 
AIDAS. 
However, there is no doubt that when a director comes to a 
theater, he imbues it with his own guidelines and his own 
character. 
  Those who know me, my views, and my manner can easily 
imagine 
what the newspaper will be like. I view the newspaper as a 
certain component part of culture and of our collective creative 
work, and will without doubt try to ensure that the newspaper 
comprises an aspect of culture. I dream about a newspaper which 
contains information, information, and more information, and in 
which commentary appears separately and only after the 
information has been presented. 
  [Simonavicius] Will there be a turnover in the ranks of 
journalists at LIETUVOS AIDAS now that you have become the chief 
editor? 
  [Saltenis] I really am a vegetarian, not a cannibal. I have 
always said and still say that I can work with anyone, because 
each person has creativity. This is something I know back from 
my days in the Young People's Theater. 
  There are times when it seems as if an actor is downtrodden, 
doesn't accomplish anything or display anything for 10 years; 
however, one has to have the ability to unlock him, to somehow 
awaken him, to find a place, topic, part for him. 
  This is why I think that the composition of the editorial 
staff might change only in the event that some people are simply 
not working, or forbid the thought, undertake to harm the 
newspaper on purpose. However, I do not believe that this will 
be the case. 
  [Simonavicius] A few years ago, you and S. Stoma were the 
founders of SIUARES ATENAI and worked together there. How did it 
come about that you are now replacing S. Stoma? 
  [Saltenis] Perhaps it is fate. I never thought or knew that 
S. Stoma was like that, just as I also was not acquainted with 
A. Juozaitis, who was also among the founders of SIAURES ATENAI. 
  [Simonavicius] The former editor maintained that the 
Conservative Party was involved in his dismissal. Can you 
confirm or deny this? 
  [Saltenis] I cannot. I also have no intention of concealing 
that I am a member and a founder of the Fatherland 
Union-Conservative Party. However, it would be stupid of me--and 
it would also harm the newspaper and Lithuania's press as a 
whole--if I envisioned LIETUVOS AIDAS as a party newspaper. 
  [Simonavicius] S. Stoma has indicated that SIAURES ATENAI 
was 
an unprofitable newspaper, but he managed to buy $60,000 worth 
of LIETUVOS AIDAS shares. 
  [Saltenis] It would be great if SIAURES ATENAI would have 
that much money and could support other newspapers. However, 
SIAURES ATENAI is an unprofitable newspaper and stays on its 
feet thanks to donations and supporters. S. Stoma is apparently 
a fine economist and businessman, but such things are of little 
interest to me. 
  S. Saltenis will channel all the money received from various 
existing and future funds supporting the democratic press into 
LIETUVOS AIDAS, and will not take one cent of this amount. S. 
Saltenis will truly not cost LIETUVOS AIDAS a cent, because he 
will work without salary, as he has also worked up to now at 
SIAURES ATENAI. 
  [Simonavicius] All this notwithstanding, where did you get 
the money to buy LIETUVOS AIDAS shares? 
  [Saltenis] There is no money yet, there are only supporters. 
  [Simonavicius] Can you specifically name those supporters? 
  [Saltenis] I will be able to say more precisely later, when 
these matters are settled. I am not taking care of this 
personally. However, the money will not be deposited for the 
purpose of making a profit on it; the money will stay in 
LIETUVOS AIDAS. 
  [Simonavicius] How will you coordinate the responsibilities 
you have as a member of Seimas, as a member of the board of a 
private company, and as a newspaper editor? Doesn't this 
conflict with the Constitution? 
  [Saltenis] There are, I believe, a number of Seimas members 
who head companies, firms, and newspapers. This question had not 
occurred to anyone up to now, because those members of Seimas 
belonged to the governing majority. However, if the type of 
problem to which you refer were to emerge, there would be a 
variety of ways to go about solving it, about which I would 
gladly inform you. 
  I ended up here very unexpectedly and these are very 
difficult days for me now. A lot of psychological preparation 
has to go into something like this, and that is a great 
hardship, one which I wouldn't wish on anyone.

<F P=106> [Article by Laimonas Tapinas, General Director of Lithuanian </F>
Radio and Television: "If There Is Dissatisfaction With 
Television, Let's Talk About Money"] 
  [Text] At one evening party, after all topics of 
conversation had been exhausted, someone suggested in jest: "And 
now, let's talk about television...". And indeed, conversation 
revived right away, because everyone had something to say on 
this issue. 
  A similar situation, it seems, exists in the public at 
large. 
It is annoying, though, that the scolding we receive is 
sometimes simply invalid, or that sometimes the most absurd 
accusations are levelled against us. 
  Some maintain that nothing has changed at Lithuanian Radio 
and Television, that the "Landsbergisites" are in charge and 
running things, just as before. Others, on the contrary, are 
angry that the LDDP is running things as if it owned the place, 
while opposition politicians are not even allowed in through the 
door... I admit that I react to all this shedding of tears much 
more playfully: if both sides are dissatisfied, well then, 
that's not bad, we are probably succeeding in maintaining a 
balance and in trying to achieve the goal we have set for 
ourselves--above all else, to provide information that is 
objective and free of any partisan politics. 
  With respect to political broadcasts, we intend to seek a 
balance and to do our best to ensure that the representatives of 
all political forces are able to express their opinion on 
Lithuanian Radio and Television. We want to structure our 
broadcasts so that that there is dialog instead of accusations 
made in the absence of one's opponent. And let the viewers 
decide who is right. 
  But maybe these are just our wishes? How are things in 
reality? Let's look at the numbers. 
  Last year, 247 LDDP representatives, 218 members of the 
right 
opposition, and 175 members of parties with a centrist 
orientation spoke on Lithuanian radio. The proportion on 
television worked out to be pretty much the same: LDDP - 93, the 
right - 98, the center (social democrats, Center Union, 
liberals, etc.) -64. Among individual politicians, those talking 
most frequently on the radio were C. Jursenas (46 times), V. 
Landsbergis and G. Vagnorius (34 times each), G. Kirkilas (30), 
J. Karosas (25), A. Kubilius (18), V. Jarmolenka (17). On 
television, the viewers most frequently saw V. Landsbergis (8 
times), R. Ozolas and G. Pavirzis (7 times each), J. Bernatonis 
and S. Peceliunas (6 times each), etc. This statistical 
compilation does not include those politicians who spoke briefly 
in our informational broadcasts, nor does it include President 
A. Brazauskas or Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, who spoke not as 
representatives of a political force, but as the highest 
officials in Lithuania. 
  How might one assess these numbers? Keeping them in mind, it 
is difficult to understand the short-tempered statements made 
both here and abroad by the National Harmony-Conservatives of 
Lithuania party to the effect that it is not able to make use of 
the national radio and television. I could more readily say--in 
self-criticism--that it is not normal that a group which lost 
the elections in devastating fashion spoke on television even 
more frequently than the representatives of the ruling party. 
Simply giving in to noisy protest campaigns--and in the name of 
peace--our producers apparently invited the conservatives to 
appear on radio and television more frequently than ought to 
have been done on the basis of their political weight in the 
Seimas. 
  This is even more valid with respect to the people from the 
small moderate political parties, who had the opportunity to use 
the airwaves not very much less than the two large parties. 
  A few words should also be said about the relationship 
between the national government and Lithuanian Radio and 
Television. I could characterize it as normal. Neither the 
government leadership nor the Seimas meddled in our affairs or 
tried to direct us, palm off their opinions on us, or call us 
"on the carpet", something which was entirely customary two or 
three years ago. And still, the fact that our relations are 
businesslike and normal today does not yet mean that they will 
remain that way tomorrow, nor that at some time after a change 
in government, the new leaders of Lithuania will not want to 
take advantage of the charter for state radio and television. 
This is why I am uneasy. 
  And even if the government does not make any big demands 
directly, the constant danger of this happening will always 
remain, because the financing of radio and television will 
depend on the governing structures, and even on the views of a 
single high official, who might say: "You criticized the 
government and didn't do what it wanted, and we're cutting 
several million litas from your budget..." In other words, 
state radio and television and their programs will depend on the 
government whether they want to or not. 
  Avoiding this kind of dependence, our colleagues in western 
Europe changed to a public status for radio and television a 
good 10 years ago. That is also the direction in which all of 
the post-communist countries of Central Europe are headed, and 
some (e.g., Poland), have even already gone through the legal 
steps to make this status official. 
  And what is this public radio and television? First and 
foremost, it is an entity independent of government structures, 
and this independence is guaranteed by law. The government 
neither approves nor dismisses the administrative leadership 
running radio and television. This leadership tries to work in a 
way that satisfies the public interest and it is accountable to 
a collective body composed of representatives from all segments 
of society and various political forces, representatives who are 
elected in accordance with the law and without any interference 
by the government. 
  But most important is the fact that public radio and 
television is nowhere financed out of a government's budget. In 
most European countries, the funds are accumulated from 
subscriber fees and advertising. I doubt that this method of 
financing would be acceptable for Lithuania, given its difficult 
economic situation. Supplemental taxes (20-25 litas per month 
for a family) would be difficult to bear for our people, which 
is why we are suggesting that we take advantage of the 
experience of Turkey, Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, and other countries 
whose economies were quite unstable just a short time ago. In 
those countries, the budget of the national public radio and 
television is composed of direct and legally defined deductions 
from revenues received for electrical energy. An individual 
family scarcely notices such taxes, and the radio and television 
have a stable budget that is independent of inflation and allows 
them to plan at least a few years in advance without worrying 
about the whims of this government or that. 
  In its "Signs of the Times" column on 2 January 1993, 
LIETUVOS RYTAS asks whether public status "would help improve 
the quality of broadcasts on Lithuanian television?" I am not so 
naive that I would immediately rush to respond: "yes!" With the 
Lithuanian cinema and theater dying, in view of the fact that 
literature, music, and art are going through a crisis, and with 
envy, anger, and intolerance having spread out into society, it 
is hard to imagine that the day after its change in status, 
radio and television would begin to shine with sublime, 
inspired, and interesting broadcasts... That's not the way 
things are, that's not the way things can be. Our radio and 
television are as we ourselves are. And still, in preparing a 
program, if we wouldn't have to keep one eye out for the 
government, if we would have enough technical equipment, if we 
could afford to pay the actor or the writer who was invited to 
be on the broadcast a decent fee, and not a miserable 3-4 litas, 
then it would be possible to demand a different quality of 
broadcast. In this regard, a public status for Lithuanian radio 
and television could really help quite a bit.

<F P=106> [Statements by State Duma deputies: "Civil Peace or Verdict </F>
on the Reforms?"] 
  [Excerpts] Two events in the past week--the State 
Duma's amnesty decision and the president's annual report to the 
two chambers of the Federal Assembly--have disturbed the 
relative calm of the country's political life. We have offered 
political scientists, journalists, and deputies themselves a 
chance to comment on them. Readers will easily see for 
themselves that the first event preoccupies our respondents 
considerably more. And this is natural because with the release 
of the Lefortovo prisoners there has been a qualitative change 
in the political situation in the country. And not for the 
better, it would seem. 
<H3>  Sergey Yushenkov, deputy of the State Duma (Russia's 
Choice): The Role of the Government in Both Matters Is Enigmatic </H3>
  The amnesty decree was adopted with numerous violations of 
the standing orders, serious ones at that. I will cite just some 
of them. Rybkin did not have the right to preside over the 
sitting of the State Duma since he had presented the report. But 
he employed the methods and means of the former Supreme Soviet 
produced under the leadership of Ruslan Khasbulatov. It may be 
said that Khasbulatov was set at liberty thanks to the methods 
he employed in the Supreme Soviet. A second most flagrant 
violation was that the decree was assumed as the basis, 
amendments were submitted, many amendments were rejected, but at 
least one amendment was adopted. That is, the decree should have 
been put to the vote one more time, not as the basis this time 
but as a whole. This was not done. The next violation was 
connected with the fact that representatives of Russia's Choice 
were not allowed to speak to the motion but supporters of the 
amnesty, on the other hand, were recognized repeatedly. Thus the 
decree, which was adopted with the most flagrant violations of 
the standing orders, has no legal validity. This was not, 
unfortunately, noticed by the representatives of the president, 
this was not noticed by the prosecutor general. Although we can 
agree with their interpretation of the Constitution, amnesty is, 
truly, the prerogative of the State Duma, not the president. 
Though in this case the content of the amnesty goes beyond the 
framework of amnesty proper, it was a pardon. And the latter is 
the prerogative of the president. 
  The affiliation to the Communists, the Agrarians, and the 
Zhirinovskiyites of the Shakhray faction, New Regional Policy, 
and Women of Russia and their incantation to the effect that if 
we adopt the amnesty decree, peace will reign in the country, is 
at the least very naive and simply foolish. And it is surprising 
that such a shrewd politician as Shakhray does not understand 
this. It is most likely that he understands full well that it is 
extraordinarily important for him currently to score points 
before the presidential elections, but he has in this case lost 
considerable popularity. The amnesty decree testifies also that 
the pro-government grouping in parliament has strengthened. From 
a number of indirect indications it may be said with a great 
deal of confidence that Chernomyrdin's department was involved 
in the adoption of this decree. The president had to have 
noticed this, I believe. 
  The ministers, except for the members of Russia's Choice, 
voted for the amnesty, as did the officials connected with the 
government. There is also indirect evidence that the document 
was looked over by the government's legal services. That is, the 
government has thrown the president, we may say, an open 
challenge. Whether he will take up the challenge or not it is 
hard to say, although the statements he made, all too late, it 
is true, testify that he has a very clear idea of the disastrous 
nature of the decision. It essentially takes us back to a state 
of, at best, uncertainty, at worst, the eve of civil war. 
  The act of amnesty showed very clearly that the State Duma 
is, in effect, a second version of the Supreme Soviet, and this 
is making the world community very leery. For the act of amnesty 
is out-and-out antidemocratic. 
  It is frightening to imagine what would happen had the State 
Duma retained the functions that had been assigned the Supreme 
Soviet. 
  Now concerning the president's report. It contains a great 
deal that requires analysis. Certain things connected with a 
strengthening of the role of the state, for example, are 
incomprehensible to me. It is clear, of course, that in such 
spheres as the fight against crime and the problem of military 
security and security in general the role of the state should be 
increased. But when it is a question, say, of an increase in the 
role of the state in the economy and when the putative 
manifestation of this role is not deciphered, we could encounter 
exclusively administrative methods. In his report the president 
attempted to cover all aspects of life, but to be honest I did 
not see in the document an aspiration to achieve decisive 
changes, primarily in the sphere of the economy. And we have 
just two paths--either a return to the old, command methods or 
new steps forward, toward the market economy. Which one we 
choose will be shown by the prime minister's report. And we may 
then draw a conclusion as to what was, in fact, implied in the 
president's report. 
  The fact that the opposition was quite well disposed toward 
the report puts us on our guard also. It is entirely to its 
liking. I by no means proceed from the principle that since this 
suits the enemy, it should not, consequently, suit us. Not at 
all. I have given the reasons why the report does not suit me or 
why, at least, it requires some additional clarification. In 
short, I personally can draw a final conclusion concerning the 
report only after the president's response to the government's 
program. 
<H3>  Andrey Nuykin, Deputy of the State Duma (Russia's Choice): 
From Zhirinovskiy's `Falcons' to Shakhray's `Falconets' </H3>
  I have an ambivalent attitude toward the Duma's amnesty 
decree. 
  First, the pompous statements it contains about "national 
reconciliation, peace, and harmony" are utterly hypocritical. 
You do not have to be a Seneca to understand that political 
intriguers, putschists, street toughs, firebrands, killers, and 
looters, set at liberty and absolved of responsibility for 
bloody crimes, will enthusiastically join in the struggle for 
the seizure of power, resorting to provocations, terror, mass 
unrest, and destabilization in all walks of life. The formation 
of a broad coalition of political forces--from Zhirinovskiy's 
"falcons" to Shakhray's "falconets"--which was revealed in the 
course of the preparation and adoption of the decree and which 
has been bolstered by the appearance in the dirty political 
kitchen of proven top-level intriguers and speculators with 
Malinovskiy-like dreams of "civil peace" will find few friends. 
  Second, both the insipid response of the president to a 
situation that once again reeks strongly of civil war and the 
submissiveness with which our leaders of justice and law and 
order revealed a readiness to agree with the incompetent and 
criminal action of the State Duma are extremely surprising and 
disheartening. Amnesty is not practiced in respect to specific 
persons and crimes. It presupposes merely articles of the 
Criminal Code and nonindividualized categories of crimes 
(pregnant women, minors, and so forth). The Duma has in practice 
assumed the function of granting a pardon (prior to the judicial 
ascertainment of guilt, what is more). And a pardon, according 
to the Constitution, may be granted only by the president. A.M. 
Yakovlev, representative of the president in the Duma, together 
with our esteemed Prosecutor General A. Kazannik, should have 
known about such elementary legal "niceties." 
  Third, the Duma has shown itself completely by this action 
to 
be a socially dangerous force bent on the incitement of civil 
war. Its basis is composed once again, alas, not of legislator 
professionals but irresponsible political intriguers concerned 
with struggle for their personal careers and party or clan 
interests. The small group of consistent democrats will hardly 
be in a position to neutralize their socially dangerous 
activity. At the first constitutional possibility this Duma must 
be dissolved. Otherwise we will once again have to get out of 
political crises with the help of tanks, Alphas, and other 
unconstitutional mechanisms. 
<H3>  Viktor Sheynis, Deputy of the State Duma (`Yabloko' 
faction): Both a Thief and a Terrorist Are Equal? </H3>
  The amnesty decree is one of the most important decisions 
adopted by parliament since it started business. But it is 
fraught with serious complications and dangers. The "Yabloko" 
faction, of which I am a member, decided when preliminarily 
discussing this question that it could not support this decree, 
and not one member of our faction voted for it. We are for 
national reconciliation and a policy of compromise, of course. 
But it should be pursued between those who can, are capable of, 
and are prepared to agree to compromise. This is an essential 
condition, which in this case was not observed. 
  It is significant that the speech of the leader of the 
Communist faction during discussion of this matter was of a 
clearly expressed peremptory nature. He interpreted national 
reconciliation as a form, virtually, of capitulation before the 
onslaught of quite aggressive forces close to the participants 
in those events. 
  The mere principle of the unification of heterogeneous 
documents and heterogeneous groups of convicted persons in a 
single "package" evokes objections. Essentially, the decision 
was adopted in respect to three different groups of convicts. 
First, persons convicted of various criminal offenses, so to 
speak. I say "so to speak" because our Criminal Code does not 
draw a distinction between criminal offensives proper and crimes 
of this political aspect or the other. The point of departure 
for the decision was a draft that had been sent by the 
president. It was properly drawn up from both the formal and 
substantive viewpoints, incidentally. The Legislation Committee 
performed certain additional work, excluding from the list of 
those amnestied audacious hooligans and persons who had 
committed rape. In this form the document was perfectly 
satisfactory, and it should have been supported. 
  The second group is composed of so-called economic crimes 
and 
persons convicted, in fact, for private entrepreneurial, 
commercial, and brokerage activity. Activity that is essentially 
now perfectly legal. These people should have been released long 
ago, and they are mentioned in the draft. 
  And, finally, the most contentious section of those 
amnestied--the participants in the events of August 1991 and May 
and October 1993. 
  Setting free and dropping the charges against people who 
destabilized the political situation evoke misgivings in 
themselves. 
  But there is one further aspect making support for this 
document absolutely unacceptable. The part of it that pertained 
to political amnesty was compiled in a legally improper manner. 
For example, the list of persons to be amnestied was determined 
with insufficient precision. And there is for me a very 
considerable difference between, say, the political leaders who 
called from the White House balcony for an assault on Ostankino, 
city hall, and the Kremlin and the combatants. The call was 
undoubtedly criminal. But, nonetheless, an appeal in itself is a 
crime of one nature, and the organization of the gangs of toughs 
who carried out the attack on Ostankino and city hall and who 
were prepared to seize a number of official institutions is a 
crime of an entirely different sort. I refer to such ringleaders 
of the armed gangs as Messrs Anpilov, Barkashov, Terekhov, and 
certain others. In respect to these people the amnesty is, in my 
view, extremely dangerous. For these people will hardly be 
capable of appreciating the humanity of the action that was 
taken. They will, most likely, continue what they were doing in 
the days leading up to the event. 
  Under these conditions we were put in a very difficult 
position. I could not support this political amnesty decision in 
the form in which it was presented, but nor could I vote against 
the president's amnesty draft or, most important, against the 
release of the people accused of economic crimes. It seems to me 
that the president's position on this matter is distinguished by 
somewhat of an uncertain and improper approach. He should have 
anticipated that in sending the bill to the Duma, other groups 
of people would obviously have been mixed in with his draft, and 
he should have responded to this not when the Duma had already 
adopted a decision. 
  The most deplorable aspect in this event, perhaps, was the 
disconnection of the democratic forces in parliament and the 
role which the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction 
headed by Sergey Shakhray performed in the organization of this 
"package." I find totally unconvincing the belated explanations 
disseminated the next day by K. Zatulin, a leader of this 
faction. The problem of the unity of the democratic forces on 
matters of principle remains extraordinarily pertinent. For 
unless we find understanding among ourselves, at the 1966 
presidential elections (or, God forbid, sooner) we will find 
ourselves in a situation similar to that in which the Germans 
found themselves at the 1932 presidential elections, choosing 
between Hindenburg and Hitler. 
<H3>  Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, Deputy of the State Duma (`Yabloko': 
Yeltsin Could Have Determined Events </H3>
  Four documents were put to the vote in the Duma in a single 
package. It was against this that I, on behalf of our faction, 
spoke from the Duma rostrum. We can only agree with the call for 
civil reconciliation, but it is very important to ascertain: Who 
is reconciling with whom. Reconciliation between, say, nouveaux 
riches or embezzlers of state funds, who have plundered public 
money, and the humiliated and the insulted, who have been 
brought to the brink of destitution? 
  It can only be a question, of course, of reconciliation 
between the opposition and the president. But watching the 
release of Anpilov and Makashov, it does not seem that these 
people, who have blood on their hands, aspire to such 
reconciliation. 
  We are opposed to the release of people who besmirched 
themselves by criminal offenses during the tragic days at the 
start of last October. Mr. Zhirinovskiy himself declared that 
some have fled to neighboring republics, fearing criminal 
prosecution. 
  In addition, there are no grounds for terminating the 
investigation of the events of September-October 1993, which has 
been sought also by such irreproachable public figures as 
Mikhail Gefter. This is why our faction did not support this 
package of documents and preferred either to vote against it or 
to abstain. 
  I would like to add that not only is it unlikely that 
reconciliation, about which the general document speaks, will be 
achieved, the political struggle will merely intensify. The 
prospect of the tranquil cohabitation of the presidency and the 
legislature does not emerge, unfortunately. 
  Several months ago, participating in the work of the 
so-called Krasavchenko group formed by the leader of the Office 
of the President, I proposed that the president himself release 
the political prisoners through an edict of his. The suggestion 
was rejected by my colleagues. A situation where this act has 
been accomplished by the Duma, not the president, has come 
about. Had this been done by the president, he would today be 
determining the development of the situation. 
  At the same time accord could be achieved, although there is 
little chance of this, if parliament occupies its proper place 
and if there are no petty impediments in the way of its 
functioning like, for example, the unresolved problem of the 
location of the Duma. Ultimately it was the presidential 
structures that drew up the new Constitution, and did they not 
write that an act of amnesty was the prerogative of parliament? 
  Nonetheless, I hope for the president's cooperation, as 
before. It is important that they not throw up obstacles to one 
another inasmuch as their new antagonism would have a baneful 
effect on the state of society. [passage omitted] 
<H3>  Gennadiy Zyuganov, Deputy of the State Duma (Communist Party 
of Russia): Very Timely Decree </H3>
  The decree had a very difficult birth, but I consider its 
adoption exceptionally opportune for a number of reasons. 
  The events of August 1991 and May and September-October 1993 
were of a clearly expressed political nature. These events were 
primarily a consequence of the destructive and splittist policy 
that had been pursued by the national leadership in the person 
of Gorbachev and Yeltsin. If this ball unravels any more, there 
will be no end to it. 
  There has been a mass stoppage of production, unemployment 
has in a number of places amounted to almost 30 percent, half 
the population is not being paid on time, merely 20 percent of 
the peasantry is ready for the sowing on account of the 
nonpayments to the peasants for the grain they have surrendered, 
and the mass strike movement of the miners, students, and 
lecturers is growing. It would seem to me that under these 
conditions the State Duma has taken the first step toward 
national reconciliation, without which we will not accomplish a 
single task. 
  It seemed to me that the radical democrats, who are 
responsible for the policy of devastation of the country that 
has been pursued in recent years, the civil wars throughout the 
south of Russia, and the events that occurred in October in 
Russia, should have been satisfied with this decision the most. 
  The president avoided a direct evaluation of it in his 
report. But Yeltsin's aides subjected the Duma's decision simply 
to outright ostracism. And as far as certain journalists are 
concerned, one has the impression that peace and harmony in 
Russia are absolutely not what they want. If they do not realize 
that this is for everyone the last peaceful way out of the 
situation, they will bring down on their heads troubles for 
which neither the country nor their nearest and dearest will 
forgive them. 
  We have issued the appropriate statement: Hysteria is being 
deliberately incited and a provocation prepared in order to 
frustrate the first steps toward reconciliation. I am sure that 
both other factions and the leadership of the Duma will respond. 
The laws the Duma adopts cannot be treated this way. 
  Concerning the president's report. It seems to me that those 
who prepared it and the president himself were out of the 
country for three years. Then they suddenly saw that Russia 
needs strong statehood, that crime is raging, that science and 
culture are in a dire state, that corruption has conquered all, 
and that the bureaucracy has grown incredibly. 
  Yeltsin's report might have been deemed satisfactory had it 
been heard in February-March 1991. There would not then have 
been the collapse of the USSR, there would have been no 
Belovezha pact, there would have been no tragedy in the Caucasus 
even, there would have been no universal impoverishment. 
  On the other hand, the report was delivered in a tone 
(tough-confrontational) which was untraditional for Yeltsin. It 
contains a recognition that he also is responsible for what has 
been done and that continuing the course of shock therapy to the 
point of total shock is impossible--the total destabilization of 
the situation would ensue. Thank God that this, at least, was 
heard. But any declaration needs to be bolstered by a specific 
program. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Gavriil Popov, chairman of the Russian Movement </F>
for Democratic Reform, under the "In the Corridors of Power" 
rubric: "The Amnesty"] 
  [Text] The release from prison of the leaders of the 
October rebellion caused jubilation among some and shock among 
others. Many unequivocally see this amnesty as a huge defeat for 
the president of Russia. Let us try to sort out what is 
happening on stage, and what--behind the scenes. 
  In the course of discussing the amnesty, Shakhray's party, 
which lays the greatest claim on being considered "Yeltsinite" 
and "Chernomyrdinite" and includes several government ministers 
as well as a de facto deputy prime minister and member of the 
Security Council, suddenly supported the amnesty. One cannot 
assume for a second that leaders who are willing to go any 
length to attain for their party the status of a presidential 
party would act this way without consultations at the very top. 
Especially considering that Shakhray's party switched its 
position toward support of the amnesty precisely when it became 
clear that opposition factions could not get the amnesty for 
Lefortovo prisoners to pass on their strength alone. 
  Kazannik could have threatened to resign before the Duma 
vote. He did not. On the contrary, he encouraged the Duma: I 
will carry out its decision. 
  Next. The general procurator resigned after he released the 
prisoners. He clearly was "played up" to his successor, 
relieving him of making the critical decision. 
  There was another, behind-the-scenes process behind public 
actions. What, precisely? 
  It would be to the advantage of the new leaders of the Duma 
opposition to free the "old-timers" in such a way that the 
latter would have stayed in secondary roles or left politics 
altogether. Therefore, Duma members clearly would have waited 
with the amnesty had not the administration rushed them. 
  The presidential circles were aware that against the 
background of the government camp's falling authority 
trials could play into the hands of the accused. We 
cannot, after all, accuse someone of sabotaging shock therapy if 
we have abandoned it ourselves. In short, the temptation to drop 
the trials was growing. But they wanted very much to have 
someone else make this happen. This would have relived the 
administration of the need to provide explanations. 
  Since a majority of Duma deputies were bound by a commitment 
to free the prisoners, this needed to been taken advantage of. 
But the new opposition leaders were not the only ones who 
preferred to push the prisoners into secondary roles--the 
administration wanted the same. It was clear to those in the 
administration that the opposition currently does not have a 
common strong leader. And for new actors--and this the 
administration also was aware of--it would take years to become 
worthy contenders for the job of the president or the head of 
the government in the eyes of the people. Therefore, the 
administration was more afraid of those members of the 
opposition who were facing the trial than those sitting in the 
Duma. 
  One can easily see a release being granted on condition not 
to participate in political activities and elections until the 
next presidential and Duma election as a scenario acceptable to 
both parties to the amnesty. But this obvious version of amnesty 
was not realized. Why? 
  The presidential team always had skillfully used the 
factor of fear before the opponents of the reform. At the 
referendum in April 1993 they managed to reduce everything to a 
fight between the two camps--of supporters and opponents of the 
reform. During the September-October crisis they also managed to 
create a situation of confrontation. In December, however, no 
matter how Russia's Choice tried to put together a single bloc, 
no matter how it tried to present the elections as a fight 
between two forces, it failed. After the election, a hysterical 
campaign of fighting the threat of fascism began. The idea 
was quite old: First drive all the democrats under the banner of 
anti-fascism, and then into the pro-president bloc. 
  The administration still has not given up on the idea of 
"uniting" out of fear for the fate of the reform. But how 
to produce such fear? The course of the reform had been 
such that the fear for the fate of reform had been increasingly 
associated with the administration's incompetency. Nobody feared 
Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov. Hence came the idea to free the 
GKChP [State Committee on the State of Emergency] members and 
the Octobrists in order to restore the situation of psychosis, 
hysteria, and fear among the democratic forces. This was the 
desire that prompted the administration to go ahead with an 
unconditional amnesty. 
  It will be necessary, of course, to dramatize the amnesty. 
"Betrayal" on the part of one of the presidential parties (the 
most obedient one will play this role, of course). The 
"dramatic" resignation of the general procurator. 
"Disagreements" among advisers and aides. Panic in the ranks of 
Russia's Choice. Democratic Russia getting hysterical. The 
purpose of this all is to scare both the people, all democrats, 
and the West. Then chances of gaining from the amnesty increase. 
  So what did the high contracting parties--the presidential 
team and the Duma--agree on? Let me sketch a probable blueprint. 
They could not fail to consider three scenarios for the 
development of events. 
  Scenario No. 1. "Ideological Fighters." Not 
wishing to acknowledge themselves guilty, the accused reject the 
amnesty and demand a trial. A scenario that is most dangerous 
for both sides. It leads to a rising authority of the accused, 
which neither the presidential not the deputy side want. 
  Scenario No. 2. "Second Roles." After the release, 
some prisoners will leave politics altogether for now, while 
others will settle for the roles offered to them by the new 
opposition leaders. This is not the worst scenario for the 
presidential side, since this produces a "watch thy brother" 
situation, and amnestied extremist leaders find themselves under 
the control of more moderate Duma leaders. 
  Scenario No. 3. "Old Leaders." Released extremists 
do not settle for second roles. But the Duma is occupied. Then 
they have to regain their position outside the Duma, in the 
streets. The situation in the country is exacerbated sharply. 
  In this case the Duma with clear conscience "surrenders" 
these incorrigible and ungrateful "heroes of street 
fist-fighting" (using I.P. Rybkin's term) to the administration. 
This scenario would suit the administration best. This they can 
use to scare both reform supporters and the West. They can even 
push through approval for a state of emergency. 
  One would think--so what! Politics is impossible without 
games and cunning. But in reality the situation is not all that 
harmless. 
  First, the third scenario, which is most 
realistic, may lead to a dangerous development of events--if 
they remain passive, if the mood in the Army is uncertain and 
reformist forces refuse to unite to the crack of the 
administration's "whip." 
  Second, the voters, tired of attempts to make 
policy behind their backs, may lose the last shreds of 
confidence in both the president's administration and the 
president himself. Having realized that they have been 
manipulated, supporters of reforms may stop responding to 
appeals for support. 
  Third, the exacerbation of the situation caused by 
extremist actions of those amnestied, and their second 
incarceration, will not create the public background so greatly 
needed in already difficult negotiations on coalition. 
  To overcome this danger, the administration does not have to 
reject the amnesty. It needs, first, to severely limit the 
spectrum of potential actions of the former Lefortovo prisoners. 
Both with respect to their right to participate in political 
activities and with respect to the right to be elected. 
The Duma ought to pass amendments to the amnesty 
decision. For instance, that some of those granted amnesty 
are barred from obtaining a Moscow residency permit; some--from 
engaging in activities involving commodity and material values; 
and so on, and so on. 
  And second: Constructive forces in society and the 
presidential team should not wait for events to develop, but 
should anticipate them by expanding the work on forming a 
national coalition of supporters of reform. 
  What is needed, however, is unity that is based on a 
constructive foundation instead of fear. Unity on the basis of 
agreement with, rather than subordination to, the 
administration. 
  I remember Korney Chukovskiy's poem "Fedora's Trouble." This 
Fedora let her house get into such bad shape that all the dishes 
ran away from her. Fedora kept trying to frighten the escapees 
with all sorts of horrors--that they would get lost, drown in 
the bog, etc. But this policy of fear did not work. Fedora 
finally won by promising to radically rid the house of all the 
old dirt. And then the dishes came back.

We Look for a Black Cat Where There Is None?"] 
  [Text] According to G. Popov's version, the political 
prisoners amnesty act is an action that had been planned in the 
Kremlin. But is it really so? 
<H5>  The Duma and Its `Harmlessness' </H5>
  The State Duma's central apparat is about to exceed the size 
of that under Khasbulatov. Counter to the Constitution, I. 
Rybkin is becoming a political figure of significance. Strangely 
enough, B. Yeltsin himself, as well as V. Chernomyrdin, is 
helping him in that. They interact not with the Duma council, as 
they are supposed to, but with him personally. 
  The first most important stage--the takeover of the Duma 
apparat--may be considered a fait accompli. Which means: Its 
tremendous transportation capabilities (up to the use of private 
airlines); access to all government and military objects; 
equipping their offices with all sorts of government 
communications; the right to summon to the Duma any officials; 
and so on. 
  Next on the agenda is the removal of the main political 
opponent--B. Yeltsin. It is possible in principle? They need the 
support of only 20-25 more deputies to reach the 298 votes 
needed to impeach the president. 
<H5>  The Kremlin and Its `Geniuses' </H5>
  Let us leave the president himself outside our commentary. 
As 
is known, the retinue makes the king. How did it behave in the 
amnesty incident? Presidential advisers G. Satarov and Yu. 
Baturin undoubtedly are good as political scientists of the 
"Itogi" program, but in this case, with the help of that same 
television, they have demonstrated an inability to make 
on-the-spot decisions. It was disappointing and strange to 
realize that sometimes they did not know what was happening 
right next to them. 
  The president's Chief of Staff, S. Filatov, did not make his 
position clear, either. The same goes for R. Orekhov, chief of 
the state-legal administration (GPU). 
  As is known, the style of B. Yeltsin's retinue is to react 
frantically to events that have already happened. So today rush 
preparations are being made for the president's television 
address. The resignation of General Procurator A. Kazannik has 
been accepted. It came to the point that the president finally 
fired the head of the FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service] 
(formerly the KGB) N. Golushko. The investigative detention 
facility in Lefortovo was under the latter's jurisdiction. Let 
us remind our readers that B. Yeltsin had not dared to do this 
even after the October events, when the MB [Ministry of 
Security] demonstratively stayed out of the fray. 
<H6>  * * * * </H6>
  One very much wants to believe that the Kremlin is 
conducting 
a sophisticated and farsighted policy. But the doubt persists: 
Are we not witnessing unpreparedness and confusion among the 
Kremlin chiefs as we did in the beginning of the October 
rebellion in Moscow?

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kiva under rubric "At the Crossroads of </F>
Opinions": "Amnesty: Pros and Cons"] 
  [Text] I tend to associate our stormy political life 
simultaneously with American roller-coasters and Russian 
swashbuckling horseback races. Here, as a rule, there are both 
sudden sharp, nerve-tingling curves and people tumbling from the 
saddle. Just a few days ago public attention zeroed in on the 
President's State of the Nation message to the Federal Assembly. 
Then, after barely having time to discuss it meaningfully, we, 
voluntarily or involuntarily, switched our attention to the 
development of the plot spawned by the amnesty. And now we are 
suddenly faced with the fact of the precipitous release from 
Lefortovo Prison of Aleksandr Rutskoy, Ruslan Khasbulatov, 
Albert Makashov, Viktor Anpilov, Ilya Konstantinov, and other 
instigators of the bloody October events and Mayday clashes, 
which also had casualties. Also absolved of punishment, 
regardless of the court's decision, are the organizers of the 
unsuccessful August coup. At the same time, Procurator-General 
Aleksey Kazannik was relieved of his position, albeit ostensibly 
at his own request. 
  But let us get away from emotions and make an effort to 
comprehend all this, taking into account, among other things, 
the subsequent "exposure" of the ex-procurator. 
  First, what actually happened? The Duma passed a decree in 
full conformity with the Constitution, though one could, of 
course, argue where amnesty ends and pardon begins and what, 
actually, are the prerogatives of the Duma and the President. 
But such a debate would surely be unproductive. What guided the 
Duma, or more precisely, the majority of its members? As the 
decree states, objectives of "national reconciliation, 
achievement of civil peace and concord." We can assume that it 
had other, or even entirely different, objectives. More 
precisely, some deputies were really guided by the idea of 
reconciliation, some were moved by revenge, some pursued their 
personal or group political goals, including setting their 
sights on the presidential election, some cherished the goal of 
destabilizing the situation, and so on. So what? That is real 
politics, the vector of which is the sum of the actions and 
reactions of many interests. 
  It is another question how the Constitution could make such 
a 
sensitive, multidimensional problem as amnesty, moreover at such 
a complex, transitional stage from one social system to another, 
the sole prerogative of the Duma? But, Messrs. comrades, who is 
to blame but those who drew up the draft Constitution and 
introduced the final amendments to it? Tantrums should have been 
thrown then; now it's too late. Or, perhaps, at the time people 
had forgotten about Lefortovo? 
  Second. Every complex matter has its pros and cons. Let us 
start with the latter. With the cons, for it is precisely they 
that are now arousing public opinion. Of concern is precisely 
what Kazannik spoke of in his resignation statement. It is 
dangerous and immoral to set free people who are guilty of the 
death and injuries of many people and of causing considerable 
material damage. Yes, that is so. Evil must be punished, because 
otherwise it tends to spread like a cancerous tumor. 
Essentially, the bloody October events became possible only 
because the organizers of the bloody May events had remained 
unpunished, and before them, the organizers of the Ostankino 
pogroms. The "implacable opposition" was quite openly preparing 
for violent actions with virtually no significant opposition. On 
the contrary, it was wholeheartedly supported by the former 
Supreme Soviet and enjoyed its patronage, coupled with the fact 
that the procurator's office and court mishandled things, and 
even now we find that the Procurator-General, whose resignation 
was swiftly accepted by the President, acted inappropriately. 
Clearly, the amnesty was poorly handled. The procurator, for his 
part, either did nothing or remained aloof and then acted too 
hastily. Why? Another mystery. It is something of a conundrum: 
By its very logic, amnesty presumes the guilt of the person to 
whom it applies, whereas Khasbulatov--and he is not 
alone--vociferously declares that he doesn't consider himself 
guilty, that he suffered in the fight for freedom. In other 
words, there is neither punishment nor remorse. In purely 
Russian style. 
  The worrisome thing is that the people coming out of 
Lefortovo Prison may take up their old cause. Anpilov has 
already declared, in his purely public rally manner, that if, 
having gained freedom, he sees that prices are declining, then 
he'll concede the correctness of Boris Yeltsin's course, but if 
they rise, then he will raise the masses. And he has already 
taken part in a rally. 
  Theoretically, there is the danger of inflaming passions in 
society and destabilizing the political situation in view of the 
mounting dissatisfaction with the practice of delaying wages, 
persistent problems of reciprocal nonpayment, the state of 
affairs in the economy as a whole, and the disastrous situation 
of many "budgeteers." 
  There is a threat that the people coming out of Lefortovo 
will assemble a powerful opposition movement on a 
national-patriotic platform, a platform of counter-reform, and 
will seek to unite with the "implacable" in parliament. They 
will try to shift their main actions to the streets, inciting 
mass strikes, organizing disobedience campaigns, demanding a 
complete change in the course of reforms, and even an early 
presidential election. A hypothetical leader of the opposition 
is already being named: Aleksandr Rutskoy. 
  Such apprehensions are already being expressed in the mass 
media, and I hear them from colleagues of mine, including 
like-minded people or people with views close to mine, with whom 
I have recently been heatedly exchanging views. One of them 
declared quite strongly: "The maneuver of President Yeltsin's 
opponents in the Duma has succeeded. The amnesty is a defeat for 
democrats. It is a victory for opposition forces; it is not 
accidental, after all, that Vladimir Zhirinovksiy came to 
Lefortovo specially to declare his solidarity with the leaders 
of the October rebellion. As for those democrats who voted for 
the amnesty, in particular Sergey Shakhray with his strategic 
calculations of sorts, they have miscalculated. They simply 
overplayed their hand." 
  Only the future will reveal the correctness of one side or 
another, as well as who won, who lost, and who was duped. But 
what should not, what must not be forgotten? Firstly, that the 
Duma decree is a package. It includes not only the amnesty 
(moreover, not only political, but also economic), but also 
repeal of its previous decree of 16 February, "On Confirming the 
Members of the Commission for Investigating the events of 21 
September-4 October 1993." It goes without saying that such an 
investigation would have excited public opinion no less than the 
amnesty itself. The decree also includes a Memorandum of 
Understanding, the significance of which should not be 
overlooked. The MPs have declared to the country and the world: 
"We are convinced of the impermissibility of destablizing the 
situation in a country which possesses such a huge weapons 
arsenal... Accordingly, we consider it necessary to engage in 
political struggle strictly within the framework of the law and 
not resort to, or in any form call for, violence, ethnic 
discord, or the suppression of people holding different views." 
If these are but empty words, then there is simply nothing to 
talk about. In that case the political elite is beyond the pale 
of civilization, beyond responsibility, in the power of 
primitive instincts, barbarian "political culture," and a 
society that brings forth such an elite can stop thinking of 
democracy. Our fate is dictatorship, we are incapable of 
anything else. But that is not really the case. 
  Secondly, one should not disregard the fact that the events 
of August 1991 and October 1993 were of an unusual nature rarely 
encountered in world practice. Therefore, despite their 
similarity to many widespread phenomena, they should be treated 
as something exceptional. 
  The human losses, spiritual, ethical, and in part even 
political losses associated with the "shooting of the 
parliament" were, I sincerely believe, forced actions to prevent 
civil war and disintegration of the country, and they lie solely 
on the conscience of those who first called people to arms. 
Besides, we may have been at the threshold of a new terror. But 
you must agree that all this took place in conditions of actual 
dual power. 
  Thirdly, we have, apparently, not yet fully realized that we 
are living under a new Constitution, that we no longer have an 
almighty Supreme Soviet, and that in addition to the Duma we 
also have a higher chamber, the Council of the Federation. Let 
us suppose that Konstantinov, Anpilov or someone else would 
really like to fish in muddy political waters for the sake of 
that very "destabilization of the situation" mentioned in the 
Memorandum. What would follow then? Why, if nothing else works, 
the President would issue, with the approval of the upper 
chamber, an edict declaring an emergency situation. Then no one 
can tell him what to do! But if even then the situation gets out 
of control, the problem would be not the Anpilovs or 
Konstantinovs, but the bankruptcy of the political course 
itself, the people's failure to comprehend the essence of reform. 
  But let us pose the question differently. Nonpayment of 
wages 
for months on end, chronic government debts for delivered 
produce, a stalemate because of mutual nonpayments, and the 
chaos pervading the economy in general: is all that normal and 
acceptable? It is not, after all, our intention to carry out 
reforms in the name of reforms and against the interests of 
people. As I see it, the President in his message to parliament 
considers such things completely abnormal and demands their 
quickest elimination. Or perhaps it is normal that neither 
Gaydar nor the people who have replaced him have deemed it 
necessary to keep up a constant dialogue with the people. 
  We must explain to the people of Russia what kind of society 
we want to build, what our ideals are, what our new spirituality 
is. We should allay our compatriots' fears and give them 
confidence in the future. So far nothing like this has really 
been done. 
  Third, and here I am taking up what may be in favor of 
"opting for": for positively resolving the question of the 
amnesty as an important component of the package decree. It is 
time for those who call themselves democrats, reformers, people 
dedicated to a rule-of-law (socio-rule-of-law) state and to 
market (socio-market) relations, who honor our traditions and 
care for our national interests, to stop arguing, splintering, 
and especially infighting. The society will soon lose any idea 
of who is really a democrat. PRES [Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord] voted for the amnesty and, it is said, decided its fate. 
Also voting for it were "Women of Russia," "New Regional 
Politics," all or most of the "Yabloko" 
[Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] faction, and many of those who can't 
be called either anti-reform or anti-democratic. Actually, only 
"Russia's Choice" voted against. It is logical to ask why there 
is such divergence in the democratic camp? The reason is that 
there are, among other things, different views of the events of 
September-October 1993, and even, to some extent, of the events 
of August 1991. So perhaps it would be reasonable to try and 
bring them together, even at the risk of failure. Politics is 
impossible without taking risks. 
  It is, actually, high time to recognize realities in the 
broader aspect and get out of the cocoon of sectarianism. If the 
concept of "democrats" is reduced to "Russia's Choice," what can 
they do without forming blocs with other political forces and 
making compromises with them? Retreat into total opposition or 
prod the President towards some kind of actions? Frankly, I see 
nothing positive along that road. Because in parliament there is 
a certain balance of forces supported by certain moods of our 
citizens. One can only blame oneself for inability to conduct a 
dialog with the people and for mishandling the parliamentary 
elections, roll up one's sleeves and work hard for the future. 
As for the President himself, I consider that he acted quite 
appropriately. There is no sense prodding him towards 
confrontation with Duma members. After all, work with the 
Parliament is only just beginning. 
  And one more thing. It may develop that the supporters of 
reform would do well to accept speaker Rybkin's formula, which 
he proposed during his address to Parliament on 28 February. 
Essentially, the idea is to implement a program for getting out 
of the economic crisis prepared within the Duma. Provided, of 
course, that it is based not on intentions to abandon the course 
of market reforms altogether or to create a "government of 
national unity" made up of, say, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy and, perhaps, Anatoliy Chubays, which would lead to 
the collapse of all and everything. 
  What, essentially, is of fundamental importance to 
reformer-democrats? To preserve the democratic Constitution and 
the strategic course of reforms. And also, to win the coming 
presidential election. 
  Fourth. The amnesty will, in my view, hardly promote the 
cohesion of extremist forces in society, and in this I tend to 
agree more with Shakhray than with his critics. Of course, there 
are still unknown quantities which make predictions difficult, 
although much will get clearer in the very near future. However, 
I have always considered--and so far have not changed my opinion 
on this score--that as soon as Aleksandr Rutskoy appears on the 
political scene Zhirinovskiy will fade away as a presidential 
contender, literally before our eyes. When he voted for the 
amnesty Vladimir Volfovich probably didn't even realize that he 
was thereby placing a mine under his ambitious plans. But I do 
not preclude the possibility that circumstances may force Boris 
Yeltsin to once again enter the arena of struggle for the 
presidency and, as the ancient Romans used to say, deserve his 
triumph. But we still have to live up to that time.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy </F>
Sobchak at the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial offices; date not 
given; published under the rubric "Club 206": "Anatoliy Sobchak: 
It Hurts When a Great Power Has Such a Parliament"] 
  [Text] A. Udaltsov, editor in chief: Anatoliy 
Aleksandrovich, you were one of the most prominent personalities 
in our first (then all-Union) parliament. Tell us please, what 
is your opinion of the current Federal Assembly? 
  A. Sobchak: Frankly, it hurts that a great power 
has such a parliament. Unfortunately, many people who made it 
there are absolutely unprepared for parliamentary work. There 
are also people with a simply criminal mentality. We know that 
so far the parliament has not adopted a single positive 
decision. It is engaged in internal score-settling, endless 
rallies, petty internal scandals, and defining its own status. 
  At the same time--and I have already said this more than 
once 
with different audiences--we are not seeing the results of the 
12 December elections in the correct perspective. After all, we 
did get a new Constitution and, for the first time, completely 
different relations between citizen and state. Unfortunately, 
very little is being said about this. Most importantly, for the 
first time we held elections in an environment of a multiparty 
system, by party lists (other than elections in single-seat 
districts). Now about the results. In order for the results to 
be different, we should have avoided mistakes--the government, 
the president, and the political parties. But it was clear from 
the very beginning that the new parliament would be a motley 
crew. 
  Nevertheless, the elections did take place. There is a new 
parliament. What its fate will be depends to a large extent on 
itself. For me, the important part is that we will no longer be 
in the same political dead end we have been in for more than two 
years. 
  Looking back at the elections today, what remains to be done 
is to analyze honestly, harshly, and objectively why the outcome 
was completely different than that we had hoped for. When I say 
"we," I mean politicians and organizations of a democratic 
orientation. Nevertheless, we have taken a giant step down the 
road of establishing democracy in Russia. 
  O. Moroz, editorial board member: It appears to me 
that over the past two years you have faded as a politician. How 
do you explain this? Are you counting on a second wind? Do you 
intend to run for president in 1996? In your opinion, who will 
be president? 
  A. Sobchak: Relatively faded... I myself do not 
feel that I have faded... Because I have lived the last two 
years at the limit of my abilities. I worked perhaps more, and 
more actively, than previously in the parliament. When I came to 
the parliament from academia, teaching seemed like leisure to 
me. Now I am responsible for the life of a 5-million-strong 
city, parliamentary work seems rather easy and free of 
responsibilities. Here, the responsibility is different: You are 
responsible for the life of a city where something happens every 
day. Today it is a fire in the Admiralty; tomorrow an entire 
rayon--300,000-400,000 people--is without heat, light, and 
water. Or, for instance, the situation with purification 
systems... City residents are not even aware of the situations 
we encounter in the old city with decrepit communications. 
  That is why I perhaps do not participate in political life 
as 
actively as I did when I was a member of the Supreme Soviet and 
the Congress. But I am involved in the work of the government, 
the Presidential Council, and in drafting many decisions. 
  Being in power and having responsibility for the state of 
the 
city I could, of course, build up much greater popularity for 
myself by criticizing decisions I disagreed with. Had I said in 
the press and on television everything I say in the government 
or at the Presidential Council, it would have given me much 
greater popularity. There are things I could say and tell. But I 
believe I should not do so. Because we are going through a very 
difficult time. To hand over to the irreconcilable opposition my 
own analysis of the mistakes and wrong decisions that have been 
made, and are still being made, is to pour water on the mill of 
the counter-reformers, the enemy (the latter definition is 
simpler and more precise). 
  Over the past two years I have been asked many times whether 
I intend to run in the presidential elections. And I have said 
repeatedly for two years that I have a much simpler and more 
modest task. I am facing reelection in 1996--the day the 
president's term expires, my term as mayor also expires. Until 
then I do not intend to go anywhere. I promised the people of my 
city when I was running for mayor that I would work in the city 
honestly and conscientiously for five years. 
  O. Moroz: What if Zhirinovskiy becomes president? 
  A. Sobchak: In the event the impossible does 
happen and the country goes to Zhirinovskiy, I will do 
everything I can to have Petersburg secede from Russia. 
  Now, about elections of a new president. Of course, we have 
to start preparing for them now. As for myself, I am not 
preparing for these elections for a number of reasons. One of 
them is a superstitious feeling of self-preservation. Not a 
single political figure from Leningrad or Petersburg fared well 
after moving to Moscow. Most often their life ended prematurely 
and violently. 
  A. Udaltsov: How, in your opinion, did a change of 
course take place in connection with Gaydar's departure? Was 
this course correct? 
  A. Sobchak: In principle, Gaydar's course was 
absolutely correct. There is real proof of this. I will not 
compare our economy with the Ukrainian, Belarusian, or any 
other. Today we have already reached the point where the Russian 
ruble is no longer termed "wooden." While other republics 
consider their currencies "wooden" in relation to the Russian 
ruble. I realize that 100 percent foreign currency 
convertibility, at least in relation to these "semi-currencies," 
coupons, and such, is small consolation, but still. When I went 
with the president to sign an agreement with Georgia, it was as 
if we had returned to the end of 1991, except even worse: The 
same distribution of basic foodstuffs by coupon, bread lines, 
empty store counters... Returning to St. Petersburg, I 
deliberately asked many people: Would you like to go back to 
that today? Yes, many people are unhappy about prices. But would 
you like to go back to December 1991, when there was a shortage 
of everything? Everything except lines? I am convinced that not 
a single person in Russia now, now that we have experienced 
store saturation, is dreaming about the past, unless he is 
playing political games. 
  The reform course had been chosen correctly. It was 
impossible to make it without certain elements of shock therapy. 
But from the very beginning a mistake, typical for Russia, was 
made. While implementing the reform it was necessary to make 
realistic adjustments to it. The idealistic straightforwardness 
in the implementation of the reform was obvious. 
  In St. Petersburg our radical democrats accused me of 
conservatism, shouting that I was shielding the nomenklatura. 
All because I kept as advisers in the mayoralty many people from 
the old nomenklatura who know how to work. I also advised 
Gaydar: Have as advisers people who know the national economy. 
The kind you can wake up in the middle of the might to tell you 
what a plant in Nizhniy Tagil makes, what is produced in 
Sverdlovsk and Petersburg, or where production of some or other 
item can be set up. They are not being utilized today in any 
way, but they have tremendous experience. 
  Yuriy Shchekochikhin, member of the editorial 
board: I am interested to learn about the chief of the 
Baltic Steam Line, Kharchenko. He was arrested for taking 
bribes. Then he was let go. I know that considerable pressure 
was brought on this "case." There was a letter of support from 
Rostropovich, although I do not think they are acquainted. I 
know that you, too, spoke in defense of Kharchenko. I think this 
is not quite proper for a city mayor. It resembles the old party 
obkom [oblast committee]. 
  I am generally uncomfortable about a class approach to 
corruption. If he is one of ours, he can do anything... 
  A. Sobchak: I think the entire definition of the 
corruption issue is completely incorrect. I remember all those 
conferences on corruption, Rutskoy's appointment as the man in 
charge of combating this evil--before those 11 suitcases 
surfaced. And mutual accusations? All this creates an absolutely 
abnormal, distorted atmosphere of public life. It fogs the 
environment, and then those who truly are corrupt, who take 
bribes, remain in its shadows. While such people as Rutskoy and 
Shumeyko slug it out. By the way, I am convinced that neither 
one nor the other is corrupt. They, of all people, did not take 
bribes. Meanwhile, the ordinary citizen, a Philistine, gets the 
impression that they are all from the same lot. 
  Corruption is the main topic played up by the 
counter-reformers, those who are fighting against democracy in 
Russia. Their goal is to destroy confidence in the new authority. 
  This situation seems absolutely abnormal to me. Wherever we 
are dealing with crime and corruption we have to have concrete 
facts. Instead, people are pushed out of politics by talk and 
rumors. 
  Now about Kharchenko. I took a very definite position on 
this 
matter because from the very beginning it acquired political 
overtones. There were attempts to use it against the city 
mayoralty and against me personally. I know that it was 
organized at the directive of Moscow, because they needed an 
example. This case came up right after the conference in the 
Kremlin on combating corruption and crime. Comrade Rutskoy 
proposed: Let us stop the idle talk; organize a few cases so 
that people can see who steals and how. And suddenly, without 
rhyme or reason, proceedings are initiated, and a man is 
arrested right on the train. Why is it that all the repressions 
in Stalin's time started in Leningrad? It is the most convenient 
place to attract attention and give an example of what to combat 
and how. I believe, however, that when a criminal case gets 
political overtones, I, as the mayor of the city, as a political 
figure, as a citizen, and as a jurist, have an obligation to 
speak up. And not only with respect to Kharchenko. As to his 
particular case, we will wait and see. Let us see how this case 
ends and what kind of charges are brought. There are no bribes 
involved there. He has nothing to do with corruption. For my 
part this is not a class approach--it is the position of the 
mayor of the city in which the chairman of the Union of 
Entrepreneurs and State Enterprise Directors is arrested. 
Economic managers turn to me: Why are we again being arrested, 
grabbed in the street? Also, a taste has suddenly developed for 
arresting... academicians. It is dangerous to fight gangsters. 
An academician, on the other hand, especially on an economic 
matter, on charges that he has allegedly set up an illegal 
structure, may be taken right on the street, by people 
brandishing submachine guns and pretending that they are 
fighting mature criminals. 
  Unfortunately, today all talk of corruption is 
phrase-mongering. I am telling you as a jurist. Until I see in 
the Russian Criminal Code the words that corruption is a crime 
consisting of such and such, as a jurist and a citizen I do not 
want to discuss this evil altogether. 
  Yu. Kulikov, deputy editor in chief: In September 
of last year, when Edict No. 1400 came out, could you foresee 
the consequences it would lead to? After the events of that fall 
the situation in the country, in my opinion, remained as 
unsettled as before, if not worse. So was it worth it, as they 
say, to start the scuffle? 
  A. Sobchak: Such a method of resolving a political 
situation is altogether unacceptable. They could have, and 
should have, done it without tanks shelling the parliament 
building. Thus avoiding national shame. Of course, when you do 
not know how to play chess, and the opponent starts winning, you 
can take the chess board and slam him on the head with it. This 
is the same: They could not win the game, so they slammed the 
opponent on the head. 
  I was not the one to make this decision, however. The 
Presidential Council is a consultative body. At its meetings we 
only express our opinion, and the president has the right to 
follow it or disregard it. 
  I want to emphasize, however, that when it got to the point 
of armed rebellion, which is precisely what was happening in 
Moscow, I did not have any doubt that force had to be used to 
suppress the rebellion. Therefore, on my own initiative, I sent 
two OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments] regiments to 
Moscow, leaving my city practically exposed. Since approximately 
1600 on 3 October it was clear to me that this was a matter of 
life or death. And of the future of the country. I gathered my 
staff together; we discussed what was going to happen and what 
we have to do if power in Moscow fell into the hands of the 
rebels. I believed then and believe now that one has to fight 
for his ideas rather than wait to be hanged on the first 
available lamppost. 
  Yu. Solomonov, deputy editor in chief: If fascists 
come to power in Russia, St. Petersburg can, of course, secede. 
But do you not think that lumpenization of the population in the 
city on the Neva is proceeding even faster than in Moscow? I 
mean the numerous pro-fascist publications there, the mood, and 
most importantly, movements and organizations of this bent. 
  A. Sobchak: Thank goodness, over the past three 
years our city has not experienced the same kind of political 
battles as other places. I consider it one of our main 
achievements--the city lives a calm political life. We do not 
prohibit anyone from holding rallies or demonstrations. And they 
take place in a somewhat different key in our city... 
  Now about how we are fighting the spread of pro-fascist 
attitudes. First and foremost, we are trying to restore 
Petersburg as a spiritual and cultural center of Russia. Much 
has already been done. For instance, not a single theater has 
closed down. On the contrary, many new ones have opened. We try 
to have cultural events take place in the city each day; we want 
to turn it into a center of international festivals, meetings, 
seminars. In addition to everything else, it may become one of 
the distinguishing features of the city and one of the main 
sources of revenue. Today I am doing everything to ensure that 
no more plants are built in Petersburg. We are trying to move 
production facilities away from the center, especially hazardous 
ones. I think that most military-industrial complex enterprises 
will die out. First and foremost because there are no people in 
Petersburg today who would wish to do such hard unskilled work. 
Take the Kirov Tractor Plant, where in the past a man--as a rule 
covered with tattoos and rippling muscles--sat there and 
tightened nuts on Kirovets wheels. Where did such a guy come 
from? The general director would come to the obkom and say: I 
need a residence permit for 5,000 "nut-tighteners." The 
Leningrad Chief Construction Administration also brought in 
about 20,000 construction workers a year, who were housed in 
dormitories. This is where Zhirinovskiy's supporters come from. 
They are well aware of this in Moscow. In place of the defense 
sector, dozens of enterprises should arise, which will produce 
all sorts of products for people. This is our future. By the 
way, there are no factories in Paris... 
  I think it is in our common interest not to let the country 
become the Russia of Zhirinovskiy. And this should not happen. 
Such provincial fascism, a provincial political snow job at an 
unbelievably primitive level... Russia will not allow it to 
happen. 
  Yu. Solomonov: Germany also thought highly of 
itself. 
  A. Sobchak: Still, history does not repeat itself. 
People do learn from the mistakes of others or from tragedies of 
the entire humanity. Therefore, what could happen in Germany at 
the end of the 1920's-beginning of the 1930's cannot be repeated 
in Russia at the end of the 1990's and beginning of the next 
century. 
  Yu. Solomonov: All this is interesting to listen 
to. We have to get rid of hazardous production. But is there not 
an attempt at a certain social selection in all this? Your 
colleague Yuriy Luzhkov put restrictions on the entry into 
Moscow of persons of Caucasian ethnic origin. You put 
restrictions on "nut-tighteners." This is not the way to improve 
the quality of society and not the way to fight crime. You can, 
of course, create "oases." But this milieu will exist somewhere 
else and will coagulate into seats of social tension. At the 
101st kilometer, perhaps? 
  A. Sobchak: Do not interpret me in such a 
primitive way. We say that the city's profile needs to be 
changed--not that Kirov plant workers should be thrown out on 
the street. They must start doing other things. It is a job for 
a robot to tighten nuts. A worker must move to another job that 
will have more content, spirit, will transform him. 
  A. Sabov, commentator: You said that there are no 
factories in Paris. There are factories in Paris. In Rome, 
however, there is only one plant--it makes gas lighters. Rome is 
completely a city of intelligentsia. But it is also a city of 
strong right-wing traditions. The fascist electorate there is 
very great. Therefore, ridding the city of proletarians does not 
insure it against fascism. How many people in your city live 
below the poverty line? As city mayor, what do you do above what 
the central authorities do? 
  A. Sobchak: I would like to get rid right away of 
such a formula as "getting rid of workers, of the proletariat." 
We do not intend to get rid of anyone. I repeat once again: The 
meaning of the program is to give these people different jobs. 
So that they may do other things in the city. In particular, in 
Paris, too, the Reno plant is not in the center of the city. As 
for people living below the poverty level... This is one of the 
main problems and difficulties of transition from one system to 
another, building a principally new economy. The state may 
succeed only if during the transition period it provides a 
proper standard of living for the people and proper social 
programs. 
  Journalists reproached Luzhkov for not wanting to let people 
from the Caucasus come to Moscow. But this is not Luzhkov's 
problem--it is a problem of a state that does not have borders. 
When Russia sets up its borders and begins letting into Russia 
only those it wants to let in on business or as tourists, then 
it will be a different matter... 
  Until Russia has borders, it will be very difficult to fight 
crime. 
  Now about social protection. Our city is special. Even 
Moscow 
cannot be compared with it. One and a half million out of 5 
million of our population are pensioners, disabled, and 
survivors of the blockade. These are the people who have found 
themselves practically below the poverty level. And we were the 
first in Russia who had to introduce allowances for them, 
spending almost half the budget on it. Every quarter we 
determine the subsistence minimum. And make up the difference to 
those whose salaries or pensions are below that minimum. Of 
course, because of this we build less housing, or do less of 
some other things. But when I speak to the citizens of the city, 
I always say that I cannot do otherwise. If you believe that 
this is wrong--please, you have this right, collect enough votes 
and recall me. As long as I am the mayor of the city, I cannot 
stop caring for these million and a half people. 
  Thanks to some social measures, the city remains stable. Our 
bread prices are still much lower than those in Moscow. Perhaps 
this is the reason Zhirinovskiy came in only fourth in our city. 
And the democrats as a whole took 65 percent of the vote. 
  D. Molchanov, commentator: You have said the word 
"enemies" several times. This is a very strange trend. Do you 
not believe that the authorities today deliberately are building 
up the image of an enemy? And do you not think that this is 
happening because, as experience shows, this authority can only 
operate effectively in extreme situations? 
  A. Sobchak: I do not think so. The authority is 
not creating the image of an enemy. It is simply that during the 
transition period there are people who do not accept this 
authority and are ready to fight it--not by political methods 
but with arms. Which they have said many times. The same 
Zhirinovskiy is already threatening to put many in "Sailor's 
Rest." This is all much more serious than you think. For 
instance, a few days ago in Petersburg a whole underground 
munitions plant was liquidated. There are also armed groups 
pursuing specific goals. By the way, we have already seen this 
in the example of 3-4 October. This is not the image of an 
enemy--these are real enemies. Perhaps those who take up arms 
are not strictly speaking enemies, just confused people. But 
those who are behind them are real enemies of Russia going the 
way of democratization, of Russia becoming a democratic instead 
of militaristic state, a state that works for its citizens. You 
are mistaken if you think that someone is creating this image. 
  Here is the reality--in Petersburg as late as 1989, 76 
percent of the economy was working for defense. This set the 
stage for a real confrontation of interests. People who are 
fighting to preserve this status are enemies of our society. We 
should not be afraid of this word. If they really come to power, 
they will shoot, root out all elements of democratic life. 
Because they do not need it; it is against their interests. 
Therefore we should say these things straight. The Moscow events 
in October showed that the irreconcilable opposition has 
well-armed, organized structures. And arms, and money, and 
trained people. You cannot dismiss this. 
  And I cannot agree with you that the authority is effective 
only in extreme situations. Had that been the case, today we 
would be like Georgia. We do live somewhat differently. 
  A. Rubinov, commentator: As is known, you have 
already been president... of the Consumers Union! So how can you 
allow the offensive against the consumer to come from Leningrad 
of all places. Your city, for instance, was the first to raise 
public transportation rates. And yesterday there was a report 
that in your city one has to pay now to get information on the 
train schedule. The whole perestroyka started with charging for 
the use of public restrooms. 
  A. Sobchak: In Norway it costs a dollar to use a 
public restroom. The minimum wage there is $2,500, however... 
  Anatoliy Zakharovich, as a former president I will say this 
to you, the former vice president of the Consumer Union. First, 
your information regarding Leningrad introducing this is 
somewhat incorrect. We always watch to make sure that our prices 
are not higher than those in Moscow. In our city, for instance, 
those who use public transportation pay only 14 percent of the 
real cost of the ride. The real cost of a subway ride in 
Petersburg today is R210. But the passenger pays only 14 percent. 
  A. Rubinov: Are there examples in the world where 
public transportation is self-sustaining? 
  A. Sobchak: Everywhere. 
  A. Rubinov: Nowhere! Nowhere in the world! 
  A. Sobchak: Everywhere. Because the cost of using 
public transportation in all developed countries is extremely 
high. One subway ride in Norway costs $7... Now, about fees for 
information. A journalist's ear is built somewhat differently 
than that of other people. This information was reported this 
morning. I heard it. This is what it said: We have learned that 
the October Railroad administration is considering introducing 
fees for information beginning next month... But you should know 
that the Leningrad Station in Moscow also belongs to the October 
Railroad. Therefore, if this is introduced, it will be in effect 
not only in Petersburg but also in Moscow. As mayor, I will try 
to interfere. To which the railroad chief will tell me: I plan 
to make R200 million a year on this. I will tell him: All right, 
I will pay you this R200 million, but do not disgrace our city 
in front of the rest of Russia. That is all. But I cannot order 
him. 
  A. Rubinov: If the MPS [Ministry of Railroads] 
begins to charge for information, it will be more profitable for 
it to keep changing the schedule than to stick to it. This way 
the MPS will show a wonderful bottom line, while the trains will 
be late even more often. 
  G. Tsitrinyak, commentator: A purely practical 
question. The last time I saw ground attendants was about 15 
years ago in the Maksim Trilogy movies. They were dispersing a 
demonstration there. How is the situation with ground attendants 
now? 
  And the second question. Do you not believe that people who 
get maimed on city streets should get compensation from the city 
treasury? 
  A. Sobchak: The second question is easy to answer. 
We have legislation which assigns each city street to housing 
offices and enterprises, which are legal entities. Therefore, 
there is always someone to sue. The important part is to prove 
that the accident was a result of appropriate measures not being 
taken, or violation of existing regulations. Then the court will 
award you compensation for damages. I happen to be a specialist 
in this area. In almost all cases, those who turn to the court 
get compensation for traumas received on the street. 
  Regarding grounds attendants. We have lost them, and normal 
care of buildings along with them. Generally speaking, we will 
have to do a lot to get things in order. For instance, the 
mayoralty has appropriated R100 million to put lights in all 
arch passageways in the center of the city. We have practically 
completed this work. We are also restoring the position of 
grounds attendant. Although this is a very costly undertaking. 
It will cost the city budget about R10-15 billion. 
  Yu. Kulikov: In your future book, which 
LITERATURNAYA GAZETA recently referred to, you maintain that the 
LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and its leader are a 
creation of the KGB and the CPSU Central Committee. However, 
Gorbachev immediately refuted your statement... 
  A. Sobchak: Yes, I am writing a book "There Once 
Was a Communist Party..." It will contain quite a few 
little-known facts and details. In particular, this story. 
Mikhail Sergeyevich says that Sobchak was not present at that 
particular Politburo meeting, and that it did not adopt a 
decision regarding the LDPR. But this is not what I am saying. 
An opinion, as they say, was floated, an idea--to take the 
process of formation of a multiparty system under control. And 
the first party that was officially registered after Article 6 
had been repealed was the liberal democrats. It was organized 
quite quickly, efficiently, and yes, with the participation of 
these organs. When I publish this book, it will tell all of this 
in detail; I will quote documents, materials, persons. Because I 
realize that if I do so without substantiation, I will be facing 
lawsuits. 
  A. Udaltsov: Of course, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA also 
took part in preparing society for democratic changes. But then 
we saw how much blood was spilled. In Tbilisi, Vilnius, the 
Dniester Area, Tajikistan, Karabakh. Was there a different way 
to democracy--bloodless? And do you have any new viewpoint on 
those events in Tbilisi? 
  A. Sobchak: The first question, I think, belongs 
to the realm of scholastic reasoning. Life, politics, consists 
of realities. If we study the real experience of other countries 
we can see that a different transition was possible. With less 
blood, fewer losses. But let us recall how the transition from a 
totalitarian regime to democracy was carried out in postwar 
Germany or Japan. They lived in an occupation regime. The 
disciplined Germans, those who had been members of the Nazi 
party, were simply ordered to join parties of a liberal and 
Christian democratic orientation. They did so. In the final 
analysis it was all accomplished without bloodshed. 
  I am not sure that without an occupation regime there they 
would have managed without bloodshed. But if there are no 
renewal processes in society, it will simply perish. If Genscher 
thinks he destroyed communism, it is because he wants to think 
this of himself. The communist system destroyed itself. It was 
not the democrats who overthrew this regime in 1991. Because if 
you read what we were writing and saying as late as the summer 
of 1991, you will see that our plans assumed many years of 
existence of the Communist Party. But it all collapsed, and not 
because of some CIA intrigues or Genscher's activities--it 
imploded. Because it could no longer exist. That is all there is. 
  About the Tbilisi events. I recently met with Boris 
Nikolskiy, a former secretary of the Communist Party of Georgia 
Central Committee. He is still convinced that the main mistake 
was that the action was not tough enough. Had it been tougher, 
more decisive, everything would be in order. This is a 
tremendous delusion! And the impotence of the authority. 
Patiashvili and other Georgian leaders instinctively felt their 
impotence. All the rayon and lower level party committees 
apparently function, but then suddenly some people appear out of 
nowhere, gather a rally, and people follow them. The authorities 
can do nothing about it. 
  This impotence of the authorities begets fear. And fear 
begets an inclination toward violent solutions. Had the massacre 
not taken place in Tbilisi on 9 April, I am convinced that we 
would not have this provincial fascism Gamsakhurdia brought with 
him (it is Georgians themselves who found this very precise 
description of this regime). There would be no Gamsakhurdia. On 
the wave of that massacre, however, he grew into a political 
figure of major proportions and managed to convince the entire 
nation over a very short period of time that they do not live 
well because Russia is squeezing all the life juices from them. 
Georgia has everything, he said. As soon as we close the border 
with Russia, separate ourselves from it, the nation will recover 
and live well. Only a man who is absolutely sick or completely 
ignorant in economics could say that. He was both--sick and 
ignorant. And he still convinced the people that Georgia would 
survive without Russian oil, gas, grain, and many Russian 
things. But the fact is that many republics had been subsidized 
by Russia. Just like in Russia many autonomies are subsidized by 
Petersburg and Moscow, Tyumen, and about 10 other regions. What 
is happening is that the excess emotions to which people are 
prone are being played on. We have been conditioned by all our 
history to create idols for ourselves. This is where our 
serfdom, slavery, manifests itself. We cannot do without idols. 
Both Georgians, and we, Russians. When we become a civil 
society, it will live without idols. It will not talk endlessly 
about the president and chairman of the government. This should 
be the last thing to interest people. And it is all because a 
free man lives with less dependency on the state than we, unfree 
people, live today.

<F P=106> [First installment of two-part article by Gennadiy Zyuganov </F>
under the heading "Essay in Russian Geopolitics": "Exploit of 
Rus"] 
  [Text] The highest flights of majestic power and spiritual 
purity have alternated in the history of our fatherland with 
periods of state and political catastrophes and religious-moral 
eclipses. Their deep-lying causes and roots are inaccessible to 
an analysis within the framework of the customary approach and 
require a serious and comprehensive philosophical 
conceptualization. This field still awaits its thoughtful and 
impartial researcher. At the same time, on the other hand, the 
practical needs of the present day insistently demand a 
determination of the pluses and minuses of Russia's present 
position on the basis of the centuries-old majestic tradition. 
  So that we might, finally, stand with a "firm footing" on 
the 
native soil of the country's primordial national interests, it 
is vitally necessary that we restore the natural historical 
retrospective. And the formulation of such a most important 
philosophical problem presupposes, in turn, the accomplishment 
of the following tasks: 
  1. The formulation of a concept making it possible to reveal 
and substantiate the "geopolitical invariants" of Russian 
national interests, that is, the stable requirements pertaining 
to the assurance of state security that guarantee us long-term 
conditions of the country's peaceful and harmonious development. 
  2. The formulation of a procedure of the "ideological 
correction" of our ailing society aimed at restoring the 
historical continuity of Russian life in the national 
self-consciousness, reviving the spiritual health of the people, 
and ensuring the moral immunity of public opinion to relapses 
into "foreign-mania." 
  3. Determination of a prospective model of Russia's social 
and state development in the channel of its distinctive 
traditions, spiritual reference points, and religious shrines. 
<H5>  Two Approaches </H5>
  A distinctive method making it possible to ascertain the 
invariants of Russia's state interests is that of geopolitical 
analysis. In terms of its content, geopolitics is a science 
studying the normalities of the influence of geographical 
factors on the role of states in world history and the formation 
of political trends and the national-state interests of various 
peoples and countries. 
  The basic propositions of this science were formulated back 
at the end of the last century by the British political 
scientist Halford Mackinder (1861-1947), whose studies formed 
the basis of all subsequent geopolitical models of world 
history. The term "geopolitics" itself, however, was first put 
to use by the Swedish expert Rudolf Kjellen and immediately 
taken up in Germany by Karl Haushofer, who became a most 
important authority in this field. 
  A most important postulate of geopolitics is the assertion 
that for formulation of the optimum strategy of state 
development paramount significance should be attached not to 
political or ideological predilections--short-term and rapidly 
changing--but to stable factors of a country's 
spatial-geographical position. Geopolitics attributes to such 
primarily a state's location (continental, insular, or 
littoral), the size of its territory, the prevailing type of 
communications (sea or land), the predominant landscapes, and 
similar parameters. 
  All the remaining aspects of state life, be they 
commercial-economic or political-ideological, are deemed from 
this viewpoint to be factors which are, although important, 
nonetheless subordinate. It is believed here that it is the 
permanency of the main "support characteristics" chosen as the 
reference point that enable geopolitics to formulate with the 
maximum efficiency the strategy of state development--be it in 
the sphere of its foreign policy or defense. 
  In most general form the essence of geopolitical doctrine 
may 
be characterized by the following most important propositions: 
  Throughout human history two alternative, continuously 
contending approaches to the conquest of the earth's surface 
have formed the basis of constitutional development. They 
may be designated the continental, land-expansionist, approach 
characteristic of continental states and the "nautical" approach 
basing the economic prosperity and state power of the metropolis 
on the exploitation of overseas territories, which makes 
domination on water lines of communication of fundamental 
importance. 
  In recent European history the basic principles of 
geopolitics are convincingly illustrated by the opposition of 
the "ruler of the seas" of the British Empire to the states of 
continental Europe that developed in the 16th-19th centuries 
into a whole series of almost continuous wars and clashes both 
in the European region and in the enemies' continental 
possessions. America, which in the 20th century became Great 
Britain's geopolitical successor, but no longer on a regional 
but on a global, world scale, naturally inherited all the 
fundamental features of this path of development. Throughout the 
last century the scientific-technological revolution has 
contributed and continues to contribute a number of essential 
correctives connected with the modernization of the means of 
information and communication, but there have nonetheless been 
no fundamental changes here as yet. 
  Speaking in this connection of the molding of cultural and 
world-outlook values, it should be stipulated that the complex 
and mysterious sphere of the spiritual and religious-moral 
development of the peoples cannot be adequately described in 
terms of geopolitics concentrating their main attention on 
outward, state-political forms of societal existence. But it can 
be seen distinctly here that liberal-democratic ideology with 
its cult of individualism and personal success serving the 
commercial-economic mechanism of the "market" plunder of 
continental sources of raw material and manpower becomes a most 
important pillar of the trading "nautical" civilization. At the 
same time, however, the traditional world outlook, with its 
powerful communal roots presupposing the priority of solidary, 
collective, conciliary forms of societal self-organization, 
becomes the ideological foundation of "totalitarian" continental 
culture and spirituality. 
  With reference to modern conditions what has been said above 
signifies that the territories and regions lying on the 
"continental periphery" of Eurasia and representing a connecting 
link, as it were, between the inland expanses of the mainland 
and the expanses of the oceans inevitably become an arena of 
bitter and uncompromising opposition. 
  The "nautical" civilization endeavors to the utmost to 
advance inside the mainland, turning the expanses which have 
been won away from it into "forward-basing zones" and original 
strong points for the defense of its global interests. In turn, 
the representatives of the "continental" geopolitical tradition 
have no choice but to make every effort to "throw into the sea" 
their ocean adversary, having increased their own influence in 
the littoral zone, creating in this way a barrier against his 
expansion. 
  The United States expended colossal efforts to establish a 
celebrated "arc of instability" on the external borders of the 
USSR. Or we recall the well-known call of Zbigniew 
Brzezinski--"to nibble at the Russian pie around the edges." 
Truly something to think about. 
  In such a system the coordinate of the notorious "new 
world order" appears to be nothing other than an attempt to 
enshrine on a planetary scale the leading role of the "ocean 
power" United States and its satellites by way of the power 
imposition on the entire world community of the "liberal-market" 
values of the trading nautical civilization. 
<H5>  Elevation of the State </H5>
  As a subject of geopolitics, the Russian state took shape 
back in the ninth century as a result of the unification of 
related East Slav tribes, the ancient cultural center of which 
was the Middle Dnieper region headed by Kiev. Since the moment 
of its formation Kievan Rus immediately became a most important 
state of that era, and its statehood was of an unequivocally 
continental nature. The basis of the material prosperity of 
Kievan Rus determining to a considerable extent the burgeoning 
of a very rich culture also was control over the inland mainland 
expanses through which the celebrated trading route "from the 
Varangians to the Greeks"--the most important communications 
artery of Eurasia of those times--ran. 
  The development of Russian statehood was from the very 
outset 
filled with dramatic content, for that matter. A stern test 
awaited the young state en route to prosperity: An insidious 
steppe predator, the Khazar Khanate kept a jealous eye on its 
strengthening rival. Their struggle, in the course of which it 
sometimes appeared that the unenviable role of submissive vassal 
had been prepared for Rus, until, finally, the valiant and 
warlike Prince Svyatoslav smashed the khanate in the mid-10th 
century, lasted several decades. 
  The first military encounters set a disturbing tone, as it 
were, for all of subsequent Russian history. For 10 centuries 
after this Russia had time after time--again and again--in 
continuous rivalry with aggressive neighbors to prove its right 
to distinctive existence, paying for this with the blood of its 
best sons and daughters. 
  Just about the most fearful test on its historical path was 
the Tatar-Mongol yoke. The immense empire of the Genghis 
Khanites, which encompassed the entire mainland and stretched 
from "the walls of immovable China" to the Baltic and from 
Northern Siberia to Khorezm and Bukhara, was, by all accounts, 
to have swallowed up as part of itself for good the "land of the 
Rus" as a distant western province. 
  No one could have imagined that Rus, ravaged and 
perishing in the turmoil of princely fratricidal strife, would 
have taken over the baton from the empire of the Genghis 
Khanites and at a price of incredible sacrificial efforts have 
united within it the giant expanses of Eurasia, becoming forever 
a guarantor and custodian of world geopolitical balance. 
  Nonetheless, this is precisely what happened. 
  Lost in the remoteness of impenetrable forests, the 
downgraded hamlet of Moskova rose by the efforts of a long 
succession of Russian princes--patient, consistent, and 
single-minded builders of sovereign power--higher and higher, 
becoming the visible center of all-Russian national-state unity. 
It defended this role in the 14th-15th centuries by the 
diplomatic skill of its rulers, the commercial aptitude of the 
merchants, and the martial valor of the warriors, who fell in 
countless numbers in 1380 on Kulikovo Field, paying the supreme 
price for the independence of their country. 
  As a result of heroic efforts Russian statehood had acquired 
a new quality by the mid-15th century under the scepter of Ioann 
III. 
  Nonetheless, the true founder of the Russian geopolitical 
state was Ioann the Terrible. First, he conquered the Kazan and 
Astrakhan kingdoms--the last islets of the former Tatar-Mongol 
might. Russia's second strategic breakthrough was the annexation 
of Siberia. Altogether this process took several decades, its 
decisive stage was the campaign of the Cossack chieftain Yermak 
Timofeyevich, who was zealous for the security of the country's 
eastern borders against the nomad raids. 
  The formidable tsar clearly understood the geopolitical 
needs 
of his state. It was no secret to him that the logic of Russia's 
national-state interests insistently demanded control over the 
maritime regions, and he began in the West an exhausting and 
bloody war for the return of the country's sea boundaries--for 
an outlet to the Baltic, which had come to be called the 
Livonian Sea. For 12 years (1558-1583) Russia strained every 
nerve in the struggle against four enemies--Poland, Sweden, the 
Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Livonian Order. The cause 
begun by Ioann was completed by another celebrated 
sovereign--Peter I, the founder of the Russian Empire. 
  As distinct from the conventional opinion, in fighting 
Sweden 
(the strongest European power at that time) for the Baltic Peter 
was not so much endeavoring "to carve out a window onto Europe" 
as, on the contrary, to secure Russia against possible 
aggression from the direction of the sea. 
  It was these same geopolitical considerations that dictated 
many other famous undertakings of Peter--the building of the 
navy, the decision to erect a new capital "on the shore of the 
desert waves," and the close attention to European engineering 
and military innovations. When the Northern War with Sweden 
ended in 1721 with the Peace of Nystad (which annexed Ingria, 
Estonia, and Livonia to Russia), this signified not only the 
return of primordial Russian lands but a triumph of geopolitical 
single-mindedness which ensured a regime of the maximum possible 
tranquillity and peace for the population of the region, 
incidentally, for the next 200 years (until the advent of those 
who loved "to rectify injustice"). 
  All of Russia's subsequent steps aimed at the discovery of 
its natural geopolitical borders were dictated by its aspiration 
to sovereign-state peacemaking. The closest confirmation of this 
is the history of the annexation to Russia of the Crimean 
peninsula. As of the 15th century the Crimean Khanate, the last 
fragment of the once mighty Golden Horde, having consolidated 
its position in Crimea and having become a vassal of the Turkish 
sultan, became a pirate's nest regularly sending out its hordes, 
which laid waste to everything around and reached the walls of 
Moscow in their raids. 
  Russian troops attempted repeatedly to put an end to this 
plunder, but their forces were insufficient, and the raids 
continued. Finally, in the course of the 1768-1774 Russo-Turkish 
War, in which Catherine II had been forced to act to secure the 
country's southern strategic borders, Crimea was taken by 
Potemkin's army. The center of aggression was suppressed, and 
long-awaited peace was established on the vast expanses of the 
Black Sea steppe, which lost, as a result of the Russian 
Empire's single-minded pursuit of its geopolitical interests, 
its border and "front-line" status. 
  A no less striking example of Russian peacemaking was its 
decisive contribution to the victory over Napoleon. From the 
viewpoint of the local European France-Britain opposition 
Napoleon, with his "continental system," was undoubtedly the 
main threat to the "nautical" geopolitical principle personified 
by Great Britain. Nonetheless, on the scale of the immense 
Eurasia this conflict was of a manifestly local, peripheral 
nature, whereas Bonaparte's attempts to conquer Russia, having 
disarticulated its giant expanses, contained a lethal threat to 
the entire geopolitical balance of the mainland. 
  It is interesting that even so decidedly an anti-Russian 
politician as Henry Kissinger was recently forced to acknowledge 
in the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE that "the tsarist and Soviet 
empires twice saved the European countries' independence 
inasmuch as without their contribution Napoleon and Hitler would 
have gained the ascendancy." A compliment from a highly dubious 
source, of course, but nonetheless.... 
  Following the victory over Bonaparte, it was thanks to the 
efforts of Alexander I (with the active role of the Austrian 
Chancellor Metternich) that the Holy Alliance of continental 
states of Europe--Russia, Prussia, and Austria-Hungary--which 
was one further attempt to establish stability and security in 
the European part of the continent--was concluded. The 
persevering attempts--completed by Nicholas I--to secure Russian 
control over the strategically important region of the Caucasus 
lay in this same direction. 
  The Caucasus War of 1817-1864, which ended with the 
annexation to Russia of Chechnya, Highland Dagestan, and the 
Northwest Caucasus, was not at all (like other Russian wars 
also) an act of conquest or aggression. Following the voluntary 
incorporation as part of Russia of the Kingdom of Georgia 
(1801-1810) and Azerbaijan (1803-1813), the Northwest Caucasus 
had become a springboard for Turkish and Iranian expansion in 
the region engendering endless military conflicts and bringing 
devastation to entire provinces, and grief and death to hundreds 
of thousands of peaceful inhabitants. 
  This state of affairs was actively supported by Britain, for 
which the strengthening of the continental power of Russia 
contained a great threat. The results of the annexation of the 
Caucasus may be judged if only by the fact that the endless 
bloody wars that had been lacerating this region almost 
continuously from century to century came to an end for a long 
time under the Russian scepter. And now in our post-perestroyka 
times, when the defenders of the fatherland are abandoning the 
"independent states," blood is being shed in Chechnya and 
Ingushetia, Ossetia, Abkhazia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan! 
Does history never teach us anything? 
  Generally speaking, the leading politicians of Russia 
understood full well that the empire's Eurasian interests could 
not be secured exclusively by military power and always put the 
emphasis on peaceful influence in regions where its vital 
interests were concentrated. This, incidentally, makes for the 
unique multinational nature of Russia, which has for many 
centuries accepted as brothers all the peoples that have 
reunited with it. 
  It seemed that this growing continental might of Russia had 
become eternal and invincible. Nonetheless, the evidence to the 
contrary, the 20th century has been for our country a period of 
devastating social cataclysms, bloody wars, and geopolitical 
catastrophes. 
  In order to understand why this became possible it is 
essential to address the spiritual and world-outlook processes 
that determined the inner strength of the Russian State.

<F P=106> [Second installment of two-part article by Gennadiy Zyuganov </F>
under the heading "Essay in Russian Geopolitics": "Exploit of 
Rus"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  `Heavenly' Soul </H5>
  Geopolitics suggests how to maintain in a healthy and viable 
state the sovereign body of the country and how to harmonize and 
bring into line with objective requirements the external sphere 
of the vital activity of a great people. But there inevitably 
remains outside of the framework of this approach the immense 
and fundamentally important inner sphere of spiritual, cultural, 
and religious-moral national existence. 
  For Russia, though, this sphere has traditionally 
performed an outstanding, if not to say determining, role. The 
thousand years of our history unambiguously confirm that we are 
an idealist-people, a dreamer-people, an ascetic-people 
frequently guided in our practical activity not by the arguments 
or reason and considerations of advantage or sober calculation 
but by sincere urges of incredible force. It is they that 
at times elevate Russia to the pinnacles of almost unattainable 
selflessness, sacrifice, heroism, and sanctity, it is they, on 
the other hand, that cast it at times into the abyss of nihilism 
and moral decline. 
  For many centuries the zealous custodian of national ideals 
and shrines was the Russian Orthodox Church. It carefully made 
sure that the boundless breadth of the Russian nature engender 
holy ascetics and sovereign builders sooner and more often than 
brilliant adventurers and insatiable power-seekers. 
  The very emergence of stable Russian statehood is connected 
with a spiritual phenomenon--the baptism of Rus in 988. Having 
already been in existence for roughly 150 years by this time, 
the union of East Slav tribes, which had withstood the difficult 
struggle against the khanate of Khazaria, represented 
nonetheless a formation that was diffuse and infirm and 
threatened by the minute to fall apart under the pressure of 
intertribal contradictions and localistic tribal interests. And 
only the adoption of Christianity, which united the 
freedom-loving Polyane, Drevlyane, Krivichi, Vyatichi, 
Radimichi, and others by a strong philosophical union of common 
religious ideals, stabilized its state form, initiating also the 
start of the formation of that unique ethnopolitical and 
spiritual-ideological community that is known to the world as 
the "Russian people." 
  Since this time each in the least bit significant period of 
our history has inevitably coincided with stages of the 
spiritual formation of Russia. The people's memory has carefully 
preserved the visible symbols of this coincidence--the figures 
of all-Russian spiritual mentors such as Sergiy Radonezhskiy or 
Nil Sorskiy and sovereign Russian leaders like the 
lord-and-master princes Aleksandr Nevskiy and Dmitriy Donskoy. 
Saviors of the fatherland Minin and Pozharskiy, the legendary 
Suvorov and the "White General" Skobelev, Marshal Zhukov, and 
the present state-absolutist patriots, unreconciled to national 
disgrace and the humiliation of the Russian State, to an equal 
extent--whether they were aware of this or not--professed one 
and the same geopolitical principles, whose ideological, 
spiritual, and religious content were the ancient prophesies of 
the Monk Filofey. 
  Russia came by this continuity, however, at a high, 
immensely 
high price. Beginning in the 18th century, which had been marked 
by Peter's drastic, "shock" reforms, small cracks began to 
appear in the state-philosophical monolith of Russia. The 
point is that the "Russian idea" in its classical form does not 
recognize state power as being of self-sufficing significance, 
defining as its purpose merely the creation of the optimum 
conditions for the achievement of justice and the moral ideals 
of personal, family, and social justice. The entire 
ideology of the "symphony of powers"--spiritual, moral-religious 
and state, and secular--is based on this fundamental assertion. 
But it was this "symphonic" principle that was disrupted by 
Peter, who unambiguously made paramount the imperial, majestic 
might of the country as the highest priority. 
  The two centuries that followed were a period of continuous 
growth of the state might of Russia. But simultaneously with 
this the internal contradictions in society, the spiritual state 
of which ceased to be a paramount concern of the state, became 
increasingly profound. A severe crisis of Russian national 
self-awareness was the inevitable consequence. As a result, when 
the discrepancy between the external sovereign greatness of the 
enormous country and its internal ideological state passed the 
critical level, Russia fell under the burden of its own 
contradictions. 
<H5>  End of Empire, Take Two </H5>
  It seemed that the storm and calamities of revolution had 
become an irreparable geopolitical catastrophe for the state 
that had taken shape. Russia's continental nucleus became 
disarticulated (the Far East Republic and the newly formed 
states of Ukraine, Crimea, the Transcaucasus Republic, and the 
Baltic countries, isolated from vitally important coastal 
zones). The spiritual continuity of Russian life was brutally 
and abruptly severed. 
  Nonetheless, the centuries-old sovereign-state inertia was 
able to overcome the pathogenic energy of disintegration. In 
spite of everything--the ideological Russophobia of the radical 
party wing, the temptations of "world revolution," and the class 
antagonisms that raged in the fire of the civil war--the country 
restored its natural geopolitical shape incredibly quickly. The 
people paid a fearful price for this, shouldering the horror of 
punitive measures and starvation, devastation, the 
all-hands-to-the-pump work at the industrial construction sites, 
and the burdens of forced collectivization. But they believed in 
the ideals of justice and human brotherhood. By their heroic 
efforts the state rose again from the dead, in spite of 
everything, before the eyes of an astonished world, rising up 
like a phoenix from the ashes. 
  The main strategic problem for the long-term survival 
of Russia arrayed in the new state body of the Soviet Union was 
that of the discovery of a constructive world outlook and the 
restoration of the spiritual life of the nation. It was in 
this sphere that things were most difficult: The totalitarian 
trends of state power had acquired an ugly, exaggerated form, 
having become deadened in ideological tenets ruthlessly 
suppressing the least spark of free, inquiring thought. This 
situation, however, began to change rapidly in the years of the 
Great Patriotic War, which became the pivotal moment of the 
Soviet period of Russian history. 
  Without getting into assessments of the personality of 
Stalin, it has to be acknowledged that he more than anyone else 
understood the need for philosophical renewal within the 
framework of the geopolitical form of the USSR. He also 
understood the urgent need for the harmonization of the new 
realities with age-old Russian tradition. The result of this 
understanding was the abrupt change in the official ideology of 
the Soviet Union in the period 1944-1953. 
  The basis of the new policy was the aspiration to 
create an effective "ideology of patriotism" corresponding to 
the demands of contemporaneity which could be a dependable 
philosophical basis for the functioning of the state mechanisms 
of the enormous Soviet state and its allies. Many pages of 
authentic Russian history were restored and all persecution of 
the church was emphatically terminated as the first order of 
business to this end. 
  The USSR won the most dreadful and bloody war in the history 
of mankind. Fully in accordance with its interests, it expanded 
to the utmost the zones of influence in the sea and oceanic 
directions, blocking henceforward any attempt at direct threats 
to the borders of the state. The postwar devastation was 
overcome and an autonomous, self-sufficient economic system 
capable, given the competent domestic use of the country's 
colossal natural wealth, of providing for the steady growth of 
national well-being was created in record time. Were its pace to 
have continued, the "ideological restructuring" left no doubt 
that within 10-15 years the USSR would have fully overcome the 
negative spiritual consequences of the revolutionary storms, 
having developed their constructive results to the maximum here. 
The creation of native nuclear weapons ruled out all 
possibilities of power interference in our internal affairs. 
  Such prospects evoked in the West--the traditional citadel 
of 
"oceanic geopolitical strategy"--a state close to panic. There 
were reasons for this. A most powerful alternative center 
of world influence personifying justice and the power of the 
people and the social, political, cultural, and economic 
principles of the "continental" line of development of human 
civilization was taking shape in the person of the USSR--the 
continuer of the Russian geopolitical tradition. The 
centuries-old efforts of the commercial and financial 
cosmopolitan elite to create a "world system of the 
international division of labor"--the economic basis for the 
subsequent political standardization of mankind within the 
framework of a "new world order"--were in jeopardy. 
  This dramatic global encounter of the two archetypes of 
world 
politics, economics, and culture was personified in the 
opposition of the two superpowers--the United States and the 
USSR--which acquired the forms of the cold war. 
  The anticommunist rhetoric of the "free world" and its 
hypocritical concern for "human rights" here were the 
ideological screen behind which the invariable age-old 
geopolitical interests of the West demanding the weakening and, 
if possible, the destruction of Russia were concealed from the 
gaze of the uninitiated. This hypocrisy has become particularly 
obvious now, when the unconcealed flouting of the rights of 
millions of Russians and Russian speakers, who in the new 
ethnocratic states of the CIS have found themselves in the 
position of second-class citizens, not only is not evoking 
condemnation but is being tacitly welcomed by the "civilized 
world." 
  From the moment of the start of the cold war, when the 
secret 
mechanisms for the destruction of the Union were engaged, 
through the final act of the drama in 1991, three stages--three 
consecutive periods of the development of the geopolitical 
sabotage against the USSR--may, conditionally, be distinguished. 
  The first began immediately following the death of Stalin 
and 
was conducted beneath the slogans of "de-Stalinization" and 
"Khrushchev's 'thaw.'" History does not know the subjunctive 
mood, alas: The some 57 years of life were not enough for Stalin 
to have made his "ideological restructuring" irreversible and to 
have ensured the restoration of the Russian spiritual-state 
tradition, which had been unjustifiably interrupted. The 
leader's body was not cold in the Mausoleum before his 
successors were abruptly turning back the ideological course. 
The "entire civilized world" clamorously welcomed this maneuver, 
maintaining a modest silence about the labors it had cost its 
politicians, diplomats, special services, and "agents of 
influence." 
  The era of "stagnation" naturally continued this pernicious 
process. Dogmatic teachings that were patently out of date were 
preserved by the efforts of many of the present "outstanding" 
democrats who were at that time implacable conformist types. The 
absence of a healthy philosophical base was echoed in painful 
confusion in the sphere of Soviet geopolitics also. 
  On the one hand geopolitically substantiated attempts to 
expand the zone of Soviet influence in the strategic continental 
directions--in Afghanistan, for example--assumed a categorically 
impermissible radical-militarist nature. On the other, measures 
like the attempt to "install" Nicaragua in the "world socialist 
system," which were utterly pointless from the geopolitical 
viewpoint, swallowed up giant forces and resources. Deprived of 
an adjusted geopolitical concept, the USSR succumbed to the 
temptation of a "symmetrical," "socialist" mondialist response 
to the strategic challenge of capitalist mondialism on the part 
of the United States. 
  Year after year this insupportable burden exhausted our 
powers. Year after year we strained the resource and industrial 
and military and demographic potential of the country in the 
chase after mirages of global world leadership entirely alien to 
the very spirit of the Russian geopolitical tradition. The 
result was soon reflected: The economic situation within the 
USSR began to deteriorate consistently, and the ideological, 
religious, and cultural vacuum created unprecedentedly favorable 
conditions for the infiltration in society of alien values, 
destructive philosophies, and egotistically parasitical 
stereotypes of social consciousness. 
  Such was the general situation when the "generational 
change" 
in the highest Kremlin echelons enabled Russia's enemies to 
embark on the second stage of the dismantling of the USSR--the 
creation of the ideological base for its collapse. Its 
chronological framework encompasses 1985-1990--the bulk of 
Gorbachev's "perestroyka." 
  I have in previous articles dwelt in sufficient detail on 
the 
specific mechanisms of the "slow-moving catastrophe" that 
ensured the destruction of the USSR, so to avoid repeating 
myself I would note merely that the main areas of the 
ideological war against the Union were the avowed Russophobia of 
the denationalized part of society, the incitement of 
antipatriotic hysteria cleverly linked "in a package" with 
furious anticommunism, and the deafening, importunate propaganda 
of the "charms" of the liberal-democratic philosophy. 
  The third, culminating stage of the global geopolitical 
sabotage took just two years (1990-1991) and was aimed at 
political assurance of the disintegration of the single Union 
state. In the domestic political sphere it was characterized as 
a "struggle against reactionaries" in the directive machinery of 
the party and government, an abrupt outburst of outlying-area 
nationalism and regional separatism, the paralysis of the 
central authorities, and use of the "democratic" Russian 
leadership as a battering ram to destroy the general economic, 
legal, political, and cultural space of the country. 
  Today, with the passage of two and a half years filled 
with dramatic events that have been the natural consequences of 
the collapse of the USSR, it may be maintained with confidence 
that the backstage sponsors of this operation were, for all 
that, unable to achieve all their strategic goals. 
  And the plan was this: By way of speeding economic and 
political changes within the Soviet Union and the broad-based, 
single-minded ideological indoctrination of the populace in a 
"democratic" spirit, to cause in the disoriented society a loss 
of natural immunity connected with intuitive healthy 
conservatism and the self-preservation instinct. Having 
suppressed the protective mechanisms of social self-awareness, 
to ensure the collapse of the unified state against the 
background of the buffoonish Emergency Committee "putsch." On 
the wave of this powerful state-ideological cataclysm 
accompanied by the most powerful shock to the mass consciousness 
to occupy the key positions in all the leading spheres of social 
life. To ensure the maximum possible degree of Russia's 
economic, political, and military dependence on foreign 
(Western) influence. And, most important, having availed 
themselves of this, to trigger on a par with the ongoing chaos, 
economic crisis, and shocked state of society the mechanisms of 
internal Russian disintegration, taking as a basis the 
separatism of the national outlying areas, regional 
contradictions, and the fratricidal struggle of Moscow's 
political clans. 
  The "architects of perestroyka" evidently had in mind a 
broader timeframe for the realization of their far-reaching 
operation. The studies of social psychologists and practical 
experience show that the "period of shock" of the mass 
consciousness which is caused by sudden social upheavals and 
which "switches off" the mechanisms of social self-protection 
cannot be long. In the case of Russia-USSR the engineers of the 
collapse could have counted on four or five years, no more. 
  Taking as the initial reference point of the shock processes 
on the territory of the USSR the year of 1989, when 
"perestroyka" had entered its "revolutionary" phase, we see that 
this timeframe is today at an end. Here are the true reasons for 
the "surprise" results of the recent elections, this is the 
cause of the growth of the "neoimperial" mood in society! 
  "The sleep of reason gives birth to monsters," the sharp and 
shrewd Goya once said. Today the collective reason of our 
people is beginning slowly and with difficulty to awake 
following many years of an arduous and tormented half-conscious 
state. 
<H5>  Choice of Destiny </H5>
  The charges against Russia of a "revival of Great-Russian 
chauvinism" and the "pursuit of an imperial policy," which have 
become fashionable as of late, reflect the increased agitation 
of the world's backstage players aware that the entire global 
decades-long anti-Russia and anti-Russian intrigues are now on 
the verge of being thwarted. For it is obvious that, having 
regained consciousness from the long semi-comatose state, having 
recognized their true national-state interests, and reviving on 
the basis of millennial historical traditional values, Russia 
will not accept the humiliating role being imposed on it and 
will restore its natural position of great world power. 
  So: 
  Today, as in past centuries, the vital interests of Russia 
consist by no means of "subduing," "conquering," or 
"subjugating" anyone. Not of endlessly expanding its territory, 
which is the most vast in the world as it is. Not of straining 
the people's efforts in vain attempts to impose on someone or 
other its own view of the world as the "sole correct" and 
uncontested view. 
  They consist primarily of gathering on its land, under 
its own roof, under the protection of a single powerful state, 
all Russian people, all who consider Russia their motherland, 
all the peoples that agree to link their historical destiny with 
it. And Moscow does not have the right to abandon this 
traditional role of "gatherer of the lands"--and will not do so, 
however much some people would like to "hound the Russian bear 
in his den." 
  Further, our vital interests consist of ensuring in our own 
home unconditional and lasting peace guaranteed against all 
encroachments from outside and from within, the corresponding 
foreign policy conditions having been created for this. Of 
protecting our historical individuality and distinctive 
spirituality against the aggression of alien, perverted 
stereotypes of mass consciousness and against the noxious 
influence of immorality elevated to a norm of life and 
individualistic egotism extolled as a virtue. In order to create 
for our fellow citizens all the necessary conditions for 
education and health care, labor, and recreation, the 
development of science and culture, and a happy childhood and 
serene old age. 
  Russia is today experiencing a unique moment in his 
existence. We have in the past century acquired invaluable 
experience, by which we have come at an exorbitant, 
irreplaceable, excruciating price. Are we unable to take 
advantage of it; to consider the tragic lessons of the past, 
multiply the heroic traditions of national history, and from the 
height of the present dolorous days finally overcome the 
internal disagreements, having restored the successive and 
consistent current of our life? 
  Today, for the first time in three centuries, we have a real 
opportunity to restore the symphonic unity of our spiritual and 
state traditions. We are now all too well aware of how heavy the 
yoke of aspiritual statehood can be, and sense all too well what 
a fearful moral price would have to be paid for the loss of the 
ideals that could impart to our conciliary, national, social 
being sacred, eternal, and nontransient meaning.... 
  But in order to realize all our actual potential we must 
learn to take a sober view of things, without illusions or 
embellishment. This means first and foremost that we must 
recognize that far from everyone in the world around us will be 
happy that Great Russia is reviving. Life's realities are 
such that the age-old struggle of the two rival geopolitical 
principles will not end merely because Russia's democrats have 
suddenly become smitten with a tender love for the Western way 
of life. And this being the case, let us recall, nonetheless, 
that: 
  the state exponent and most complete spokesman for the 
competing geopolitical model is the United States of America 
superpower with its strategic allies constituting altogether the 
geopolitical bloc that we are accustomed to designating by the 
term the "West"; 
  the economic exponent and industrial pillar of this model is 
the commercial and financial cosmopolitan oligarchy straining 
after world domination and constituting the main driving force 
of the contemporary mondialist plan of the "new world order"; 
  its philosophical exponent is liberal-democratic ideology, 
whose basic features are extreme individualism, militant 
aspirituality, religious indifference, a devotion to mass 
culture, antitraditionalism, and the principle of the domination 
of the quantitative over the qualitative principle.... 
  There are, unfortunately, exponents of this geopolitical 
principle within Russia also. A fifth column of politicians and 
public figures and parties and organizations of a "pro-West" 
persuasion united by a commitment to the "wild" market and the 
unchecked "integration of Russia in a single world community" 
and the unconditional priority of "values common to all mankind" 
are appearing primarily in this unattractive role. 
  Let us say at once that the affirmation of these facts is 
under no circumstances a call for confrontation and enmity. On 
the contrary, a clear understanding of the situation only 
increases the chances of a reasonable compromise and mutually 
beneficial cooperation. 
  I would like in conclusion to emphasize once again the 
thought that serves as the leitmotiv of the entire article: We 
are today faced with a choice that will determine Russia's fate 
for a long time to come. A choice that we should be helped to 
make by our entire age-old history, our entire tragic and heroic 
experience, and by all our incalculable and nameless compatriots 
who from age to age created the great state and defended it 
against encroachments and adversities. 
  We simply do not have the right to make a mistake in this 
choice!

  [Text] When in 1991 I completed my article "The Faces of 
Power or the Power of Faces?" dedicated to then members of the 
USSR Council of the Federation, I had occasion to devote a small 
section, "Aspiring Figures," to leaders of the former Russian 
autonomies. Three years have gone by and the "aspiring figures" 
have turned into real, active politicians, often quite well 
known, who are actively influencing the situation in the Russian 
Federation. And so these new observations are devoted to 
them--more or less an expanded version of my previous section, 
but written in recent times when it is not so much the component 
parts of the Russian Federation that are desirous of sovereignty 
as much as Russia itself. 
<H5>  AUSHEV </H5>
  The very appearance of the president of Ingushetia on 
Russia's political scene is akin to the emergence of his native 
republic. Ingushetia has emerged, one might say, under extreme 
conditions, following the proclamation of independence of the 
Chechen Republic and the actual collapse of a united entity that 
existed for many years--the Checheno-Ingush Republic, in which 
the Ingush people occupied far from a dominating position. 
Likely hoping for a return to the status quo, the federal 
authorities were in no hurry to recognize the new republic and 
contribute towards the structuring of its organs of power. In 
the meantime, a territorial question lay at the center of 
Ingushetia's political life--the fate of Prigorodnyy Rayon, 
which found itself part of neighboring North Ossetia after the 
deportation of the Ingush people. Nazran associated the return 
of the territory in dispute with Moscow, a factor that was not 
least important in leading to tragedy and an almost complete 
loss of trust in the federal center and in Boris Yeltsin. Then 
we see emerging in this catastrophic situation in 
Nazran--General Ruslan Aushev, a veteran of the war in 
Afghanistan and former Union people's deputy, appointed head of 
the provisional administration in Ingushetia. Indeed, the 
situation that had taken shape as of that moment in the republic 
demanded a leader of precisely such "generalship." But Aushev 
also showed himself to be a quick-witted politician. Resigning 
from the position of head of administration, he distanced 
himself from the center, which had lost its prestige, and was 
viewed in the presidential elections as the undisputed national 
leader. But this prestige has not diminished Ruslan Aushev's 
difficulties. After all, he must construct virtually brick by 
brick the power of a republic that until quite recently did not 
exist, a republic with undetermined borders and a chaotic 
political life. And he must do all this under conditions of a 
state of emergency and unsettled conflict with Ossetia... At the 
same time, Ruslan Aushev is managing to preserve a certain 
loyalty from afar in his relations with President Boris Yeltsin 
and the federal leadership. One example of this diplomacy of the 
Ingushetian president is Boris Yeltsin's recent Caucasus trip 
and Ruslan Aushev's handshakes with North Ossetian President 
Akhsarbek Galazov. 
<H5>  BIRYUKOV </H5>
  Nikolay Biryukov, chairman of Mordvinia's Supreme Soviet, 
has 
managed to show quite convincingly that it is he who is the real 
"boss" in the republic. Losing the presidential election in 
December 1991 to the Democratic Russia nominee--engineer Vasiliy 
Guslyannikov, the Supreme Soviet chairman did not content 
himself with the role of "second fiddle." In confrontation with 
President Guslyannikov, Nikolay Biryukov, an experienced party 
functionary who attained the position of secretary of the 
Mordvinian party obkom [oblast committee], has successfully 
taken advantage of the mistakes of the young administration and 
Guslyannikov's lack of understanding of the processes of 
sovereignization in the Russian republics. The Mordvinian 
president--of Russian nationality in addition, has become an 
active ally of Moscow (and just about the only one) in the 
struggle against the apparition of separatism. Perhaps it is 
precisely the Mordvinian president's lack of a stance in favor 
of independence that proved the decisive factor in the decision 
of the republic Supreme Soviet to eliminate the position of 
president in April of last year and elect a new government 
headed by Valeriy Shvetsov: Authority and the initiative were 
returned to Nikolay Biryukov. Despite the support the central 
authority attempted to render Vasiliy Guslyannikov, the duality 
of power was not long preserved. The Kremlin's gestures could be 
perceived as lack of respect for the decisions of the republic 
parliament, and the constitutional courts of Russia and 
Mordvinia confirmed the legality of the Supreme Soviet 
resolutions. Following the October events, President Yeltsin 
appointed his own representative to Mordvinia. Nonetheless, even 
under conditions of the triumph of the central authority, 
Nikolay Biryukov's enemies failed to collect the necessary 
number of votes to remove him from the post of Supreme Soviet 
chairman. In addition, results of the Russian parliamentary 
elections in Mordvinia registered a change in the mood of the 
electorate: New Prime Minister Shvetsov and two members of the 
Communist Party became deputies. And so, nothing now stands in 
the way of Nikolay Biryukov--having shown what republic 
independence means in practice--from joining with the group of 
republic leaders most supportive of the concept of sovereignty. 
<H5>  GALAZOV </H5>
  Recently elected the president of North Ossetia, Akhsarbek 
Galazov is one of the best well known leaders of the Caucasus. 
This is due both to the geopolitical role of his little 
republic, which finds itself in the middle of two intricate 
territorial conflicts (Georgian-South Ossetian and North 
Ossetian-Ingushetian), and to his own personal capabilities, as 
became clear during the course of the presidential election 
campaign. Indeed, the recent Supreme Soviet chairman has easily 
managed to show that he is the number one leader in the 
republic: Aleksandr Dzasokhov, one of the strongest aspirants to 
the office of president, former member of the Politburo of the 
CPSU Central Committee and first secretary of the North Ossetian 
party obkom, withdrew his own candidacy, and Viktor Khetagurov, 
chairman of the Council of Ministers of North Ossetia, was 
defeated and forced to resign the post of prime minister. Two 
experienced party and economic leaders fell by the wayside 
before the former rector of North Ossetian University, who 
served in the educational system almost his entire life--a 
situation atypical overall of the republic elite. But over the 
four years of his stay at the head of North Ossetia, Galazov has 
been able to become not simply its leader, but a symbol of the 
republic's rigid position in the territorial conflicts as well. 
Appearing on the post-USSR political scene alongside Torez 
Kulumbegov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of South Ossetia, 
Galazov never concealed the support his republic has been 
showing its warring brother on the other side of the border, and 
the parliament of North Ossetia has even recognized the former 
Georgian autonomy as an independent state. Akhsarbek Galazov 
adopted an even more irreconcilable position during the 
Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict. But it should be noted for the sake 
of fairness that in both cases the interests of Vladikavkaz 
coincided in part with those of Moscow, which in no way objected 
to the weakening of Zviad Gamsakhurdia's Georgia and strove to 
preserve the status quo in Russia's North Caucasus--violated by 
Ingushetian territorial claims. Is this not wherein lies the 
secret of Galazov's increased political influence upon the 
Moscow leadership and Boris Yeltsin's standing in North Ossetia? 
But now, having been elected president, Galazov faces a choice: 
either continue to advance the hard line advocated in fact by 
the voters or, leaning on the prestige he has already won, try 
to settle the conflict with Ingushetia and pull the republic out 
of the "front-line" state it has been in for several years now. 
<H5>  DZHARIMOV </H5>
  Adygea is the only one of the former autonomous oblasts 
transformed into republics to decide on introduction of the 
presidential form of government. Just the fact that Adygeys 
comprise slightly under one-fourth of the population of the 
republic testifies as to the complexity of the tasks to be 
accomplished by Aslan Dzharimov in this office. The separation 
of Adygea was received with a certain nervousness by the 
leadership of Krasnodar Kray, which used to include the 
autonomous oblast. Therefore, Dzharimov's role in alleviating 
the situation that has come about can be compared with the 
stabilizing role of the leaders of the new independent states 
who graduated from the Moscow political school (the Adygea 
president served many years in leading positions in the kray 
center, and his informal relations with Krasnodar leaders 
without any doubt helped in Adygea's "informal" withdrawal from 
Krasnodar Kray): In addition to concluding an agreement with the 
former "mini-mother country," the republic government introduced 
the special position of chairman [as published] at the head of 
administration of Krasnodar Kray, with the rank of minister. 
  President Dzharimov became well known to broad segments of 
society after his sudden incursion into Caucasian geopolitics. 
In the heat of the Georgia-Abkhazia conflict, the Adygey leader 
offered intermediary proposals. Like other leaders of Russia's 
Caucasian republics, however, the president of Adygea turned out 
all the same to be a resolute supporter of the Abkhaz side. This 
is explained not only by the ethnic proximity of Abkhazians and 
Adygeys and the natural sympathy Maykop has for the Sukhumi 
leadership--holding analogous status, albeit within another of 
the former Union republics, but also by the influence in Adygea 
of the Confederation of Peoples of the Caucasus, even though 
such influence is far more limited here than in neighboring 
Caucasian republics. Despite support for the concept of Adygey 
national rebirth (specifically, the republic leadership has 
assisted the Worldwide Cherkess Association, one of whose 
congresses was convened in Maykop), Aslan Dzharimov is compelled 
to proceed with special caution so as to avoid encroachment of 
any kind upon the Russian community (although Maykop is 
constantly accused of this by certain political circles in 
Krasnodar) while simultaneously ensuring the power potential of 
the "titular" people. Adygea's recent election of a new 
parliament demonstrated the great complexity of this task. 
Nonetheless, the republic remains one of the calmest regions of 
the Caucasus. 
<H5>  DUDAYEV </H5>
  The Chechen president immediately stands out within the 
overall list of leaders of the Russian republics in that he does 
not consider his republic to be a part of the Russian 
Federation. Thus, for long time now Chechnya has been existing 
in a situation that has no analog in international law (or in 
the practice of federative or confederative relations): 
Considering itself an independent state, the republic appears in 
the constitution of "a neighboring state" as a Federation 
entity. All the same, the Moscow authorities, for example, 
equate Chechens with foreigners, obliged to undergo registration 
when they arrive in the capital. This inconvenience can also be 
seen as a triumph for Dzhokhar Dudayev--one more in-fact 
recognition of Chechen independence, and as an admission that 
the federal authorities finally have to concur with the 
separation of the Chechen-Ingush Republic, accomplished "from 
below"--in Groznyy, and not "from above"--in Moscow. As well as 
the fact that there is an ever dwindling number of politicians 
in the general-president's entourage interested in finding any 
real compromise with the center--as if in response to Boris 
Yeltsin's recent speech in the Caucasus in which the Russian 
president termed Chechnya the main factor of instability in the 
region, once again ruling out any possibility of reaching some 
kind of agreement with Groznyy. 
  It is possible that the secret of Dudayev's political 
survivability also lies in the fact that his mannerisms are 
often strikingly similar to Yeltsin's. The striving to achieve a 
presidential republic, to concentrate all real power in the 
hands of the presidential administration, easy parting with 
those who were recently the closest comrades-in-arms and now the 
source of irreconcilable conflict, the ability to collect 
oneself brilliantly in an extreme situation but perform 
illogical actions in "days of peace"--all these parallels are 
familiar to observers in both Groznyy and Moscow. And indeed, 
Dudayev became the leader of Chechnya during the violent 
dissolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Chechen-Ingush Republic 
following the August putsch, while it was precisely following 
the August events that Yeltsin grew into a true state leader. 
Yeltsin's struggle with the party machine assisted in his 
formation as a political figure. The Dudayev phenomenon was 
supported not only by the trend toward sovereignization of 
Chechnya which was gathering force, but also by the sincere 
desire of the victors of August in the Russian leadership to get 
rid of "disobedient" republic leaders. A campaign of propaganda 
was launched against an entire series of leaders (both Union and 
republic leaders). Only the Zavgayev regime in Groznyy fell, 
however, and Dudayev's appearance became a fitting illustration 
of the results of this campaign. Moscow's continued struggle 
with the Dudayev regime just about led to a tragic result and 
facilitated the formation of the Chechen president as a 
charismatic personality with no other alternative. It is likely 
that under any other conditions the authoritarianism of Dudayev 
would elicit rejection of the leader and even cause his 
replacement, but in the extreme situation, the general's 
opponents simply have nothing with which to oppose him. 
Especially since not a single one of them is opposing the 
concept itself of independence, and General Dudayev is seen as 
the symbol of this concept. It is this "symbolic" aspect and a 
special economic and political freedom that allow the president 
of Chechnya to be a geopolitical figure of the Caucasus as well 
(we need only recall the congress of the Confederation of 
Peoples of the Caucasus in Groznyy, or Zviad Gamsakhurdia's long 
stay in the Chechen capital). 
  All the same, however, it would be difficult to call 
Dzhokhar 
Dudayev's position stable, even if he succeeds in resolving his 
internal problems. The positions of Russia and Chechnya relative 
to one another are such that, sooner or later, they will have to 
embark upon some path of compromise. Having already managed to 
become the symbol of an unwavering, principled position, the 
general will hardly be capable of being the bearer of such 
compromise. 
<H5>  ZOTIN </H5>
  The president of the Republic of Mari El is one of the 
"calmest" of the Volga leaders. Actively communicating with the 
leaders of neighboring Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and 
Udmurtia--well known as leaders of "the opposition" among the 
republics, Valeriy Zotin nonetheless has maintained decent 
relations with the federal authority. It is clearly no accident 
that President Boris Yeltsin began his series of postelection 
meetings with leaders of the Russian republics by conferring 
with the presidents of Tatarstan and Mari El. Zotin's position 
in this regard was brought about by the political and economic 
situation in Mari El, where the mood in favor of 
sovereignization is finding less support than in the other Volga 
republics, due to a lesser concentration of indigenous 
population and Yoshkar-Ola's economic dependence on grants from 
Moscow--the republic cannot boast about stores of energy 
resources in the manner which gives Kazan and Ufa the 
opportunity to claim special rights. Thus, Mari El is trying to 
use the sovereignization achievements of its neighbors primarily 
in a symbolic way. Supreme Soviet Chairman Valeriy Zotin was one 
of the first in the Russian republics in this position to be 
elected president of the republic. Zotin was also sufficiently 
careful during the constitutional crises, when many other 
republic leaders hastened to announce their sympathies and 
antipathies. But such caution is easily explainable by Valeriy 
Zotin's previous activity, having spent many years in secondary 
roles in the Komsomol and party apparatus. The flow of power 
from the party to the soviets made him the head of the 
republic--it did not take away the circumspectness he had 
acquired. 
<H5>  ILYUMZHINOV </H5>
  Kirsan Ilyumzhinov is perhaps the most extravagant leader 
among the republic presidents. Just the simple fact of election 
of the 30-year-old businessman as head of Kalmykia demonstrates 
the arrival of a new political era in the Russian Federation, 
when representatives of groups not traditionally found in the 
"corridors of power" are capable of taking advantage of 
relatively free, multi-candidate elections (the success of 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's party in the election to the Russian 
State Duma simply confirms this hypothesis). Like Zhirinovskiy, 
Ilyumzhinov is to a certain extent a puzzling figure. The 
seeming "simplicity" of his biography in no way explains the 
emergence of the Ilyumzhinov phenomenon--neither in business nor 
in politics. Ilyumzhinov's preelection promises constitute a 
classic example of a populist program--unrealizable if only 
because of its grandiose nature and always victorious for the 
same reasons, and his political activity following the election 
has been an odd mixture of establishment of an authoritarian 
regime in his own republic with support for soviet 
parliamentarianism on the federal level. Ilyumzhinov dissolves 
the Supreme Soviet of Kalmykia, eliminates the multiparty system 
and the republic Ministry of Security at the same time, suspends 
the federal program of privatization in Kalmykia... Having 
previously told journalists that Yeltsin agreed to view the 
republic as a "political testing ground" at a meeting with him, 
the president of Kalmykia then--during the days of 
October--turns out to be the most energetic supporter of the 
Congress eliminated by the Russian president. It is through his 
efforts that the "alternative Council of the Federation," of 
opposition regional leaders, is being instituted. It is 
Ilyumzhinov who issued statements most critical of Boris 
Yeltsin--including in the blockaded White House, and who called 
Yeltsin "the former president." Nonetheless this position held 
by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov has not swayed his standing in Kalmykia, 
judging from the results of the election to the upper chamber of 
Russia's Federal Assembly. Moscow has not yet developed 
effective mechanisms for toppling republic leaders who are 
objectionable to the center. Subject to far more heated debate 
than President Ilyumzhinov's current standing is the problem of 
the real results of his economic policy--capable either of 
bringing about a change of authority in the republic or of 
making the Kalmyk leader far more loyal in his relations with 
the center. 
<H5>  KOKOV </H5>
  The president of Kabardino-Balkaria must be referred to as a 
leader who has proven both his independence from Moscow and his 
ties with the center--which are even stronger than those of most 
of his republic president colleagues. Displaced from his 
position as chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria following the August (1991) events, Valeriy 
Kokov nonetheless easily reacquired power in just a few months, 
sustaining victory in the presidential election. Kokov's solid 
position within the power elite is entirely expected and stems 
from his previous party career, terminating in the position of 
first secretary of the CPSU republic committee. The president's 
position and prestige among leaders of the new national 
movements are far less solid. Valeriy Kokov had to play the role 
of arbiter, fighting for the concept of a united 
Kabardino-Balkaria to counter supporters of a Republic of 
Kabarda and Republic of Balkaria. He has hardly been able to 
successfully manage this role, however. In any event, a mass 
meeting of the Congress of the Kabardin People in the autumn of 
1992 almost ended in the president's resignation. It was only 
energetic support from Moscow (which probably learned a lesson 
as a result of the overthrow of Doku Zavgayev, chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet of the Chechen-Ingush Republic, and did not 
desire to repeat the Groznyy scenario in Nalchik) that helped 
Valeriy Kokov retain his position. To complete the picture one 
must recall that one of the main opponents of the president 
during those days was Yuriy Kalmykov--then president of the 
Congress of the Kabardin People and now federal minister of 
justice. 
  The unstable position of the president of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria is probably related to a lesser degree to 
personality, and to a greater degree to the very vulnerability 
of the institution of head of a "dual" republic. After the 
collapse of Checheno-Ingushetia, there remained just two such 
explosive formations in Russia, and flashes of instability in 
the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria have shown how complicated 
the republic's future can be if national elites reach agreement 
with one another, while the "party in power"--no less interested 
than Moscow in the existence of a unified 
Kabardino-Balkaria--loses the ground on which it is standing. 
<H5>  MAGOMEDOV </H5>
  Magomed-Ali Magomedov rules the most complex--by ethnic 
composition--republic in the Russian Federation. Dagestan is a 
country whose present borders were outlined just after 1917, a 
mountainous region on whose small flatlands clashed the 
interests of the Avar, Lak, Dargin, Kumyk, Lezgin, Nogay, and a 
great many other peoples, a land whose ethnic saturation and 
intermingling many times exceeds that of sadly renowned Bosnia. 
One cannot envy the leader of such a republic, especially since 
Magomedov seems to have found himself in the top position by 
accident. Since olden times Makhachkala has visibly observed the 
"Lebanese" principle of distribution of leadership positions. 
Magomedov, a Dargin, was appropriately appointed chairman of the 
Council of Ministers and was elected chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet of Dagestan, while the true head of the republic was the 
first secretary of the Dagestan party obkom, an Avar by 
nationality. However, the decay of party structures made 
Magomedov "the number one man in Dagestan" and simultaneously--a 
figure striving for caution and compromise even more than 
yesterday's republic leaders from the party obkom. The striving 
of the present leaders of Dagestan to "temporarily close down" 
sociopolitical processes, related to their understanding of the 
full danger of the interethnic conflicts in Dagestan and a 
desire to counter the ambitions of new national movements, 
constitutes conservatism at the very least. Magomedov has 
seemingly become the personification of this course in the 
republic, a republic that repudiated in referendum both the 
introduction of presidential rule and the possibility of private 
ownership of the land, as well as the symbol of a certain 
"permanent temporariness" of the present Dagestan leadership. 
  Makhachkala is also restrained in its relations with Moscow. 
Although President Yeltsin's standing in Dagestan is extremely 
low, Magomedov refrained from harsh criticism of the president 
even during the days of crisis, but at the same time did not 
participate in the work of the Council of Heads of Republics, 
where even the far more independent president of Tatarstan 
appeared. But--that is what Magomedov is all about. 
<H5>  NIKOLAYEV </H5>
  The president of Yakutia is one of the most colorful 
political figures on the republic scene. He has succeeded in 
transforming himself into a leader on the federal level, 
attaining prestige among his colleagues, and simultaneously 
establishing decent contacts with the presidential 
administration and with Boris Yeltsin. Even former Mordvinian 
President Vasiliy Guslyannikov, far more inclined to support the 
center, and one who declared his objection to republic 
sovereignty (as opposed to Mikhail Nikolayev), could not boast 
of one-tenth of such a relationship with the Russian 
leadership--the center "noticed" him following his overthrow. 
  The bond of such status held by the president of Yakutia is 
his resolute support of the Russian president during the crisis 
months. Mikhail Nikolayev was the only regional leader to 
participate in negotiations between the president and the 
parliament on Boris Yeltsin's behalf. And this was not simply 
support of a political position--it was primarily personal 
solidarity. 
  It is precisely for this reason that Yakutia's economic 
sovereignty is just about the most significant of all the 
Russian republics, even when considering republics with a 
"special position," like Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, or even 
Chechnya. Mikhail Nikolayev was one of the first to sign a 
bilateral agreement with Moscow, leaving Yakutia a significant 
share of the profit from diamonds extracted in the republic. The 
Yakut leaders engage in energetic foreign economic activity in 
both the former Union republics and the "far abroad" (without 
evoking censure from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
incidentally). Even following the October events of last year, 
when Moscow's offensive against republic sovereignties began, 
the president of Yakutia succeeded in preserving what had been 
achieved, even in augmenting it. The Republic of Sakha became 
one of the few regions of Russia where elections to a new 
legislative organ were scheduled right after the Federation did 
so. But even during the time of the old Supreme Soviet, Mikhail 
Nikolayev managed to be the undisputed leader of his republic, 
especially since he acceded to power in the classic manner, 
substituting the presidential office for the post of first 
secretary of the party obkom. If this highly experienced 
politician continues to succeed in implementing in practice, 
without complications, the model he has found of exchanging 
political support for economic privileges, then diamond-rich 
Yakutia, in the absence of external crises or confrontations 
with the center, will find it much easier than other aspirants 
to sovereignty to effect transformation into a "state within a 
state," enjoying a special role in federal affairs. 
<H5>  OORZHAK </H5>
  The career of Sherig-ool Oorzhak, president of the Republic 
of Tuva, is somewhat unusual. Holding the post of prime 
minister, in August 1991 he lost the election to the position of 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet to Kaadyr-ool Bicheldey. Then 
just a few months later, Oorzhak was elected president and 
chairman of the Government of Tuva in an election in which the 
chairman of the parliament did not even run. But the president's 
first loss resulted in further developments of the political 
situation in the republic and altered mutual relations among the 
power elite. Stated more simply, a great deal began to be 
determined by the complex interaction between the president and 
Supreme Soviet chairman, quite dissimilar leaders. Oorzhak, a 
cadre party functionary who advanced through all the career 
stages of the Tuva Party obkom administration and apparatus, has 
exhibited an understandable loyalty to the federal executive 
authority and was rather cautious in fighting for sovereignty of 
the republic (which prior to 1944 was an independent state, 
although in the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union). The 
chairman of the parliament, unexpectedly heading the republic 
following the August events and reputed prior to this to be more 
an oppositionist from the world of science, was able nonetheless 
to find a common language with the fairly conservative body of 
deputies and turned the Supreme Soviet into the major instrument 
of sentiment towards sovereignization. As a result, an article 
was secured in Tuva's new constitution on the prospect of its 
withdrawal from the Russian Federation. And so the republic 
president must take into account the sentiment in today's brand 
new parliament, the popularity and influence of its 
chairman--who kept his post, and the complete dependence to date 
of Tuva's economy on federal grants. At the same time, Tuva's 
monoethnicity--greater than that seen in many other Russian 
republics, its border location, and historical traditions enable 
the republic's leaders to continue a policy of sovereignization 
without aggravating relations with the Kremlin or forcing events. 
<H5>  POTAPOV </H5>
  The chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Buryatia twice had 
occasion to return himself to power in the republic. Leaving the 
post of first secretary of the Buryat CPSU Obkom, he worked for 
some time in Turkmenistan, but soon returned to Ulan-Ude to head 
what had become the republic party obkom, which was then swept 
away by the August 1991 events. However, in contrast to many 
other first secretaries who left politics or shifted to 
secondary roles, in just three months Leonid Potapov once again 
headed the republic, becoming the chairman of its parliament. 
These facts of Potapov's political biography alone illustrate 
fairly well the durability of his standing in the republic with 
the complex ethnic mix (additionally, Leonid Potapov himself is 
Russian), a republic burdened not only with trying to maintain a 
balance between the Russian majority and the indigenous 
population but also with potential territorial problems. As a 
result of all possible kinds of repartitionings, the Aga Buryat 
and Ust-Orda Buryat Autonomous Okrugs find themselves located 
outside the borders of Buryatia, in neighboring Siberian 
oblasts, an occurrence unprecedented even for the Russian 
Federation. Of course this has been influential in the 
development of the national movement in Buryatia and on mutual 
relations with its neighbors. For the time being, however, 
Leonid Potapov has managed to skirt around the sharp edges of 
these problems and has in fact established decent relations with 
the leaders of Tuva and Khakassia. Beginning the search for its 
own foreign policy channel, Ulaanbaatar is also watching 
Ulan-Ude with understandable interest. Thus, Leonid Potapov has 
potential for maneuver, although this has diminished somewhat in 
recent times due to a certain lack of understanding between the 
Supreme Soviet chairman and Buryatia Prime Minister Vladimir 
Saganov, a politician with less traditional views who actively 
supported Shakhray's Party of Russian Unity and Accord in the 
elections, and who additionally is Buryat in nationality. The 
upcoming election of president of the republic will constitute a 
new and fairly significant ordeal for the rule of Leonid 
Potapov. In this regard, the deep-rooted rivalry with Vladimir 
Saganov may lead to the "Kalmyk" alternative--the departure of 
both Buryat leaders from the political arena. 
<H5>  RAKHIMOV </H5>
  Recently elected president of Bashkortostan but for a long 
time head of the Supreme Soviet of the republic, Murtaza 
Rakhimov has been able to manifest himself as one of the most 
influential, while at the same time most refined regional 
leaders. Rakhimov's capabilities were fairly well demonstrated 
during the recent election. Voters turned out in sufficient 
numbers, rejected the draft Russian Constitution presented in 
referendum, elected the head of the republic parliament as 
president and as deputy to the Council of the Federation of 
Russia, and then in voting for deputies to the State Duma--left 
both Zhirinovskiy's party and Russia's Choice out in the cold, 
showing preference for the "more reliable" Agrarian Party and 
sympathizing with the regional problems of Shakhray's party. In 
this manner, Murtaza Rakhimov has confirmed once again how great 
is his prestige in the republic and how unlimited is the 
potential in Bashkortostan's vertical chain of command. 
Moreover, Rakhimov is in no way a "hereditary" party leader of 
the former autonomy; he belongs to the next layer of the ruling 
elite--the industrialists. Confirmation of the Supreme Soviet 
chairman as undisputed number one man in the republic was a 
complicated process and ended in replacement of the Bashkir 
prime minister. In addition, the republic leadership has had to 
take into account the complex ethnic composition of 
Bashkortostan both in its internal politics and in its relations 
with the center. The Bashkirs themselves constitute a minority 
here, but taken together with the Tatars they surpass the entire 
remainder of the populace in number. This circumstance was 
probably not the least significant in influencing Ufa's choice 
of a kind of "soft version" of Tatarstan politics: On the one 
hand, Rakhimov affixed his signature to the Federation Treaty, 
and on the other--achieved the signing of a virtually 
simultaneous, closed, bilateral agreement with Moscow, giving 
significant powers to the republic leadership in the economic 
sphere and opening the way for an entire series of similar 
bilateral treaties between the center and other republics. 
Hardly anyone will deny that under the conditions the Russian 
republics presently find themselves in, genuine sovereignty 
comes down to the economy, and not ethnic considerations. Ufa 
perhaps came to understand this sooner than others. 
  Rakhimov's resolute rejection of the actions of the 
presidential team during the days of conflict between the 
legislative and executive powers influenced somewhat the 
solidity of his standing. At that time Bashkortostan undertook 
steps--unexpectedly rigid for this republic--with respect to 
legislative confirmation of its sovereignty, and a campaign of 
propaganda was unleashed against Rakhimov in the Moscow 
governmental mass media. But today perhaps this conflict is 
already a thing of the past. Rakhimov was elected president. He 
is one of the most influential deputies of the Council of the 
Federation and, like many representatives of the regional elite, 
is simply necessary to the Kremlin today. 
<H5>  SPIRIDONOV </H5>
  The chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Komi Republic has 
been maintaining a successful balance to date between the center 
and a group of opposition republic leaders. Taking into account 
Komi's status in the Russian Federation, the degree to which 
republic elites exert pressure on the Kremlin may depend on the 
position of the Komi leader. In this regard, Yuriy Spiridonov 
may be compared with Yakutia President Mikhail Nikolayev--the 
Komi leader is devoting his main attention to economic 
prerogatives of the republic (especially since Komis do not make 
up a great part of the republic population; indeed, Yuriy 
Spiridonov himself is Russian). We can also make the comparison 
by career pattern. Spiridonov headed the Supreme Soviet of the 
Komi Republic after spending many years in the party, a career 
crowned by his election as first secretary of the Komi CPSU 
Obkom (which career also included the position of prison warden, 
showing that Spiridonov is no stranger to the realities of his 
region). In confrontation with Prime Minister Vyacheslav 
Khudyayev, Spiridonov has managed to date to sustain an 
impressive victory. The Council of Ministers chairman, Komi by 
nationality, has in practice supported an alternative draft 
constitution for the republic which enhances its 
sovereignization opportunities. Supreme Soviet deputies 
supported the "Spiridonov draft," however, and today the leader 
of the parliament has become a more substantive candidate for 
the highest position in Komi--that of universally elected head 
of the republic. Yuriy Spiridonov's expected success in the 
election only promises to solidify his status among his 
colleagues, who are somewhat bewildered by the Komi parliament's 
recent refusal to introduce the office of president of the 
republic. The adoption of the constitution shows, however, that 
Spiridonov has simply postponed major decisions until the 
post-October period, which will be more tranquil for him and 
marked by a strengthening of the republic elite. 
<H5>  STEPANOV </H5>
  The chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Karelia is one of just 
a few regional political figures also well known on the federal 
level. He was among the most noticeable participants at the 
deputy Congress (even heading the faction Communists of Russia 
during the period of its greatest power), and was nominated as 
this faction's candidate to the position of chairman of the 
Russian Supreme Soviet as a counterweight to "democratic" 
nominee Ruslan Khasbulatov (although today it is easy to 
understand how much more moderate and pragmatic the Congress 
would have been had it shown preference to the "communist" 
alternative over the "democratic" one). He actively participated 
in the negotiations process with the president and was one of 
the initiators of the "crisis" council of regional leaders. A 
political flexibility he acquired over long years working in the 
apparatus helped Stepanov avoid turning into an odious figure 
and helped him retain his position despite opposition attacks 
after August 1991. It also helped him understand sooner than 
others the prospects for "cautious" sovereignization. For the 
Republic of Karelia, in which Russians constitute the 
overwhelming majority of the population, this sovereignization 
is exclusively economic in nature and can perhaps be viewed as 
the "key" to possible analogous processes in the oblasts and 
krays of Russia. This process is acquiring political overtones 
because of a certain estrangement between the republic and 
federal leadership, and because of the proximity to Finland. 
Economic ties with Finland should be shored up by Karelia's 
special ethnographic image. Incidentally, Viktor Stepanov is 
Karelian in nationality and heads a parliament in which only a 
few Karelians are deputies. This is a problem in itself. 
  In recent times, due to an emerging conflict between 
parliament and the government that resolutely supported Boris 
Yeltsin in 1993, some observers cite a weakening of Stepanov's 
standing. Already he is not being perceived as the consolidator 
of the republic elite. Even if we surmise that Viktor Stepanov 
will be forced to leave Petrozavodsk, however, this would hardly 
signify an end to his political career. The Karelian leader has 
sufficiently strong ties and prestige both in Moscow and among 
his colleagues in the leadership positions of the Russian 
republics. 
<H5>  TUBYLOV </H5>
  Chairman of the Udmurt Supreme Soviet Valentin Tubylov is 
one 
of the energetic members of the Volga group of leaders of the 
Russian republics gravitating most toward sovereignty. Although 
it must be immediately acknowledged that the economic prospects 
of Udmurtia, one of the most important ancestral lands of the 
military-industrial complex of the former Union (it is not by 
chance that its capital, Izhevsk, was at one time called 
"Ustinov" in honor of the famous "patriarch" of the 
military-industrial complex), can hardly be compared with the 
prospects of Tatarstan or Bashkiria. Tubylov, therefore, in 
addition to acceding to the highest post in the republic without 
the obkom career traditional for many leaders (he headed just 
one party raykom [rayon committee] and a sovkhoz vocational 
school), may not be able to render his colleagues anything more 
than political support. But here too certain problems may arise: 
within Udmurtia--the Supreme Soviet chairman has not built a 
relationship with leaders of the government. The parliament 
replaced Nikolay Mironov, who came to power in the republic 
simultaneously with Tubylov. Concerning the new head of 
government, Aleksandr Volkov, however, "the honeymoon is over" 
(although it is the prime minister, like the recent head of the 
apparatus of the Federal Assembly, Vladimir Podoprigor, adhering 
to centrist views, who will represent Udmurtia in the Council of 
the Federation). The future political biography of Valentin 
Tubylov will therefore be determined to a great degree by the 
prospects of all the Volga republics and the fortress of their 
informal "coalition." 
<H5>  FEDOROV </H5>
  Nikolay Fedorov, the recently elected president of the 
Chuvash Republic, could turn out to be the "dark horse" among 
republic leaders were it not for his preceding political 
biography. Fedorov is a political figure on the federal level 
who left Moscow for Cheboksary--an atypical act at first glance, 
but further regionalization of the country may make such steps 
the rule rather than the exception in the game of Russian 
political chess. A lawyer by profession, Fedorov bound his 
career to Gorbachev's perestroyka. He was one of the many USSR 
people's deputies "withheld" in power thanks to the 
multi-candidate parliamentary elections in the Soviet Union. 
Nikolay Fedorov was minister of justice of Russia in the 
cabinets of Ivan Silayev and Yegor Gaydar. After the August 
events, however, a crevice appeared between him and the 
presidential administration. Specifically, the minister of 
justice came out in opposition to the establishment of a unified 
Ministry of Security and Ministry of Internal Affairs of the 
Russian Federation, and when Boris Yeltsin announced proposals 
for a special procedure for governing the country in spring of 
last year, he resigned. Like another former minister, Sergey 
Glazyev, Fedorov ran for deputy to the Russian Federation State 
Duma on the slate of Nikolay Travkin's opposition Democratic 
Party of Russia. But immediately following the resignation of 
Fedorov, who initially did not issue sharp statements, 
conjecture surfaced that his departure was related to a desire 
to occupy the office of president of Chuvashia. However, even 
confirmation of such conclusions shows that the future president 
understood in time that success in the republic could be 
achieved only at a great distance from the Kremlin. For this 
reason one can foresee that in the office of president of 
Chuvashia, Nikolay Fedorov can hardly be expected to become an 
ally of his recent colleagues in the Russian Government. The 
former minister of justice will probably easily find like-minded 
thinkers among the presidents of the neighboring Volga 
republics. The results of the election in Chuvashia can only 
intensify the already existing gravitation of Volga republics 
toward greater independence. 
<H5>  KHUBIYEV </H5>
  One of the final resolutions of the Supreme Soviet of 
Karachay-Cherkessia on the eve of parliamentary elections in 
this republic was the decision to entrust the functions of head 
of republic to Prime Minister Vladimir Khubiyev. In this manner, 
the Supreme Soviet acknowledged a fact long known to all in the 
republic which somewhat differentiated its political system from 
that of other Federation entities: that it was the prime 
minister, and not the Supreme Soviet chairman, who was the 
leader of the republic, the "uncrowned president" of 
Karachay-Cherkessia. Khubiyev has been the leader of 
Karachay-Cherkessia since 1979, when he was elected chairman of 
the ispolkom [executive committee] of the Soviet of People's 
Deputies of the autonomous oblast. His commanding position was 
confirmed as well by edict of President Yeltsin, who appointed 
Khubiyev acting head of administration of Karachay-Cherkessia, 
and by resolution of the Supreme Soviet which confirmed him as 
prime minister, and now as head of the republic. Karachay by 
nationality, Khubiyev seems to be living proof that it is 
possible for a united Karachay-Cherkessia to exist--which 
certain national movements have attempted to oppose with 
separate nation-state formations. In addition, it is important 
to take into account the indisputable influence Khubiyev wields 
within the most diverse political circles of his republic, in 
order to understand how closely intertwined the very existence 
of the Karachay-Cherkess Republic is with the personality of its 
leader. 
<H5>  CHAPTYNOV </H5>
  Valeriy Chaptynov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the 
Altay Republic, managed to accede to power in a somewhat 
unexpected manner: At a time when, in other autonomies, it was 
the first secretaries of party obkoms that headed the soviets, 
as a rule, Chaptynov was first elected chairman of the 
Gorno-Altay Oblast Soviet, and only then elected first secretary 
of the Gorno-Altay Party Obkom. A cadre Komsomol and party 
functionary (very few--even of Chaptynov's colleagues among the 
leaders of republics can boast of such a personal history, which 
includes just about all the possible jobs on the oblast level), 
Chaptynov maintained a consistently conservative stance during 
the days of crisis. He supported the activities of the GKChP 
[State Committee for the State of Emergency] in August 1991 and 
sided with the opponents of President Boris Yeltsin in 
September-October 1993. However, this did not sway the standing 
of Valeriy Chaptynov in the republic. Attempts to remove him 
following the August events did not meet with success and after 
October, the Supreme Soviet chairman won a confident victory in 
the election to the Council of the Federation of the Russian 
Federation (the second seat went to Vladimir Petrov, chairman of 
the Government of Altay, whose positions in no way always 
coincide with the views of the speaker). Clearly the leader of 
the Altay Republic not only occupies a solid position within the 
power elite of the region--he also knows very well the moods of 
the voters in this small, mountainous country. 
<H5>  SHAYMIYEV </H5>
  The president of Tatarstan has managed to become one of the 
acknowledged leaders among the heads of the Russian 
republics--thanks to Kazan's special view of the future status 
of the Republic of Tatarstan, which did not sign the Federation 
Treaty and also did not declare its independence (as did 
Chechnya), but rather agreed to sign a heretofore unprecedented 
bilateral treaty defining the relationship between the Russian 
Federation and Tatarstan, and also thanks to his methods of 
asserting his position. This position is traditionally far from 
extremist. From the very beginning, when the republic declared 
its special position (in particular, it strove to independently 
sign the Union Treaty), the president of Tatarstan attempted to 
be more an active participant in the negotiations process than 
an orator reciting slogans on sovereignty. The course he 
pursued, not well perceived initially by the Russian center, was 
later applied to other republics. Following the rejection of 
inclusion of the text of the Federation Treaty into the Russian 
Federation Constitution, bilateral "republic-Kremlin" contacts 
and contacts among republics in general may now become 
prevailing. 
  For the sake of fairness it should be recalled that even in 
the old Union hierarchy, the first secretary of the Tatar party 
obkom (and Mintimer Shaymiyev held this post) occupied a special 
position hardly comparable with the position of the other first 
secretaries/leaders of autonomies: A place was "reserved" for 
him not just in the CPSU Central Committee, but in the Presidium 
of the USSR Supreme Soviet as well (as was the case for the 
first secretaries of the capital--Moscow and Leningrad--party 
committees). If only for this reason, Shaymiyev had no special 
problem standing out among his colleagues. But as an experienced 
administrator, he knew full well that maintaining tranquility in 
a republic undergoing sovereignization, where half the 
population was non-Tatar, depended on economic stability and the 
prevention of interethnic conflict in Tatarstan. Here the 
president of Tatarstan can be compared with the president of 
neighboring Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. It is no accident 
that in both the case of Kazakhstan and that of Tatarstan, this 
concept proved its worth. In any event, the majority of 
Tatarstan voters participate (or more accurately--do not 
participate) in federal events behind the republic leaders. 
Whereas following the August (1991) events, Kazan was the party 
more interested in concluding an agreement with Moscow, today 
the leadership of Tatarstan is quite happy to maintain the 
current ambiguous status. So much simpler it is for President 
Shaymiyev to appear as an arbiter between Tatar national forces 
advocating independence for the republic and the parliamentary 
opposition oriented on the center, which believes that 
Tatarstan's status must be determined on "common" principles 
(these "common" principles change with time, incidentally, and 
will do so a good many times more in favor of the Kazan 
Kremlin--the residence of the Tatarstan president). 
<H5>  SHTYGASHEV </H5>
  Vladimir Shtygashev, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of 
Khakassia, is perhaps the most irreconcilable enemy of the 
presidential administration to be found among the leaders of the 
republics. To the very last day, Shtygashev was a consistent 
supporter of the leaders of the White House (in a recent 
interview for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA he again named Ruslan 
Khasbulatov "a great Russian patriot"). He was among the 
initiators of the idea to create an "alternative" council of 
regional leaders, and travelled to the White House on an 
intermediary mission along with President of Kalmykia Kirsan 
Ilyumzhinov and President of Ingushetia Ruslan Aushev. However, 
whereas Ilyumzhinov and Aushev, like many other creators of the 
"alternative" council, managed almost immediately following the 
October events to smooth up tensions arising in their relations 
with the Kremlin, Shtygashev stuck to his previous positions and 
categorically refused to run for the new Russian parliament. 
  Taking into account the remoteness of Khakassia from the 
centers of power, we can presume that Moscow will hardly 
undertake a serious attack in the near future against the 
authority of Vladimir Shtygashev. Especially since even in 
Abakan itself, the position of the Supreme Soviet chairman is 
complicated by difficult relations not only with the prime 
minister--traditionally closer to the executive power, but also 
with his own first deputy, whose orientation is alongside Moscow 
democrats. Vladimir Shtygashev's regional views are simpler, 
although he leads a republic transformed from a former 
autonomous oblast and detached from what is now the neighboring 
Krasnoyarsk Kray. Nonetheless, Abakan and Krasnoyarsk today 
share not only a certain political mutual understanding, but 
also active participation in the "Siberian Agreement"--converted 
from an economic alliance into the embryo of a kind of new 
regional formation in Siberia. National status can hardly be 
expected to hinder Khakassia from participating in the creation 
and construction of such a formation. After all, Khakass people 
comprise not more than 12 percent of the population here, and 
republic leaders themselves treat the republic's independence 
primarily as an economic consideration. 
  It cannot be ruled out that these comments provide far from 
an exhaustive treatment of the palette of regional power in the 
Russian Federation--of course it is far from exhaustive! It 
would probably be a very difficult task today to draw "a 
collective political portrait" of the leaders of the oblasts and 
krays of the Russian Federation. However, it was equally 
impossible until quite recently to turn to portraits of the 
leaders of republics, although we have here the very same 
people... The complex situation in the country and permanent 
sovereignization processes have turned the leaders of the 
republics into politicians. Are we not dealing with similar 
processes (perhaps they would be better termed processes of 
regionalization) when we look at the oblasts and krays? No, it 
is still to early to mark the end of the cycle "The Face of 
Power or the Power of Faces?"

<F P=106> [Article by Lyudmila Beldyugina, Stavropol: "Elections in </F>
the Regions: A Little More, and They Will Get Into a 
Hand-to-Hand Fight...."] 
  [Text] Once again, the Inner Council of people's deputies 
unanimously (with one abstention) affirmed its former decision 
regarding the numerical size of the State Duma of Stavropol 
Kray, whose elections are scheduled for 27 March. 
  What is more, the deputies decided to turn to the judicial 
organs, including the appeals and supervisory courts with 
complaint statements about declaring invalid the decree of the 
electoral commission of the kray on the elections to local 
organs of authority "Concerning the Organization of 25 Electoral 
Districts" and its other decrees that were adopted in defiance 
of the kray council. 
  The Inner Council also sent documents to the Supreme Soviet 
of the Russian Federation, appealing against a decision of the 
kray people's court, which refused to examine its complaint to 
the kray electoral commission. Thus, the dispute between the 
representative and executive branches of authority in the kray 
has entered a more acute phase. 
  The gist of the delayed and by no means concluded dispute is 
the following. In January of this year, already not for the 
first time, the Inner Council once again ratified the decision: 
Forty-two deputies will work on a permanent basis in the State 
Duma of Stavropol Kray. But the administration of the kray is 
insisting on 25, of which, in its opinion, only 10 deputies 
should work on a permanent basis, and it is also insisting on 
increasing the percentage of signatures of voters for the 
nomination of candidates for deputy from 3 to 5 percent. 
  These proposals were interpreted by members of the Inner 
Council as a frank desire of the current administration to form 
an obedient representative authority that it had in its pocket. 
After all, the more signatures that future candidates will have 
to collect, the easier it will be for the executive authority, 
which has a powerful apparatus, to push its own people into key 
posts, mainly heads of local administrations, believes Yevgeniy 
Borodin, a member of the kray council and an activist of the 
Democratic Russia movement. Many kray, oblast, and city dumas 
are being formed today according to this principle. He reported 
that after a meeting of the Inner Council, which affirmed its 
previous decisions, the deputies learned about the decree of the 
head of kray administration, Yevgeniy Kuznetsov, in which the 
numerical size of the future duma of 25 deputies apparently is 
legalized. The kray electoral commission is also adopting a 
similar decree to please the governor. 
  Briefly, the elections are just around the corner, but the 
dispute is heating up in earnest. The people's deputies believe 
that the 25 districts--according to the number of candidates for 
deputy--that were organized by the kray commission are illegal 
and that the competence of the deputies in them can be disputed, 
which creates a basis for the instability of future authorities 
and the sociopolitical situation in the kray. 
  "Supporting our assumptions that the kray administration 
will 
create an obedient authority is the fact that the first 
registered candidates for deputy of the kray duma are entirely 
representatives of executive authority," asserts Ye. Borodin.

<F P=106> [Article by Marina Loboda, VLADIVOSTOK: "One Hundred Fifty </F>
Candidates Nominated to Kray Duma"] 
  [Text] Lists of contenders for seats in the 
representative organ of authority in the kray have been compiled 
in the kray's electoral commission. 
  According to preliminary data, 150 Maritime Kray residents 
are contending for 39 seats (on the average, 3.85 persons per 
seat). Of these, 129 are men and 21 are women. 
  The greatest political activity was noted in the 14th 
Electoral District (Frunzenskiy Rayon of the city of 
Vladivostok). Eight contenders were nominated here, which is 
explained by the considerable size of the district--more than 
57,000 persons. 
  The minimal possible number of contenders was nominated in 
nine districts--two persons each, which could be an indication 
of the low interest in politics among the population, as well as 
an indicator of the serious approach of the citizens to the 
evaluation of their political data. 
  An overwhelming majority of the contenders are managerial 
workers, and an increased interest in politics has been noted 
among doctors. Given a closer examination of the list, one could 
find in it: metal workers--one, lathe workers--one, and 
sailors--one. 
  On the other hand, 37 former people's deputies decided to 
take this path once again. Among them--six former chairmen of 
soviets at all levels. 
  No less active were the presently functioning authoritative 
structures: 15 heads of administration of rayons and cities of 
the kray are tying their future fate to the kray duma. The 
greatest activity here was displayed by officials of the kray 
center: Six representatives of the city administration and six 
from the kray administration intend to expand their 
authoritative powers at the expense of duma seats. It is 
impossible not to note the fact of the inclusion in the 
political campaign of A. Pavlov, deputy governor of the kray, 
who was on the point of receding into the shadows. 
  The Zvezda plant took first place among the enterprises of 
the kray. Right off there were four contenders for a seat in the 
duma--is this not conversion?

<F P=106> [Interview with P.M. Nazarov, manager of the Maritime Kray </F>
department of the Pension Fund, by I. Permyakova, UTRO ROSSII 
correspondent; place and date not given: "Why This Pension Fund 
Is Necessary"] 
  [Text] A decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian 
Federation on the establishment of the Pension Fund of Russia 
(PFR) was adopted on 27 December 1991, and a pertinent statute 
was developed. The obligation of the fund is "to ensure the 
collection of insurance premiums necessary to finance the 
payment of state pensions, while fully making good use of the 
rights granted to it for these purposes." But it was necessary 
for this to organize a state data bank by the end of 1992 on the 
payers of insurance premiums to the PFR....to initiate 
preparatory work on the organization of an individual account of 
mandatory insurance premiums coming in from working citizens, 
keeping in mind in the future to increase the size of state 
pensions owing to the resources they contribute. 
  By no means all of our readers understand what the 
basic functions of the Pension Fund include and what 
specifically required its creation, and therefore I. Permyakova, 
our correspondent, turned for an explanation to P.M. Nazarov, 
the manager of the Maritime Kray department of the Pension 
Fund. 
  "Our fund," explained Pavel Mikhaylovich, "is federal, and 
therefore, we transfer a considerable part of the collected 
resources to Moscow. But the gist of it is in the following. 
According to the law, each employer must participate in the 
establishment of the PFR, just as every employee must who is 
accepted for work. In addition, the employer pays 28 percent of 
his income monthly, and the worker, 1 percent. This is done 
somewhat differently in the civilized countries of the West: 
When a person assumes one or another position, an account is 
opened in his name in an appropriate insurance company to which 
a certain percentage of wages is transferred and frozen there 
until the worker goes on pension. In Finland, for example, a 
person does not have to go for his social security after he 
becomes a pensioner: They will come to his home and process 
everything. If he transfers from one enterprise to another, his 
personal account follows him, as before remaining inviolable. 
It is not this way in our country: Monetary inflation does not 
make it possible for us to operate in the European fashion; 
money is being devalued. Therefore, this kind of solution was 
found: Collect 28 percent from any organization and 1 percent 
from the person who works in it. It turns out that the one who 
is working now provides for the old age of the generation that 
has left for a rest.... And our main task is to finance the 
payment of pensions. 
  [Permyakova] So that it turns out: It is not enough that 
you work for the people of Maritime Kray--you also finance 
Moscow? 
  [Nazarov] I will explain: There are 88 territorial 
(regional) okrugs in Russia. There are such oblasts and krays 
(Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays and Tambov and Kursk Oblasts, and 
some others) that were always subsidized, but in the Far East 
there are very many people who work here (especially fishermen), 
but who are registered in the Western part of Russia. They will 
not be able to make use of the resources transferred from 
enterprises to the local Pension Fund, owing to which a specific 
surplus is established that we transfer to the center for their 
maintenance. Actually, in [line of text missing] more than 50 
billion rubles [R]. 
  [Permyakova] Well, nonetheless, was there a need to 
establish your fund? 
  [Nazarov] Judge for yourself. Previously, resources for the 
payment of pensions were placed in the budget. But inasmuch as 
the social sphere was always financed according to the residual 
principle--the resources set aside for its needs were spent on 
all kinds of things!--there was practically no money left to 
fortify the welfare of the indigent strata of the population. 
In connection with the changes in the economy of the country, 
the idea came up about separating the pension fund from the 
budget, so that no one would be able to use it for unplanned 
purposes. 
  [Permyakova] Did I understand correctly that owing to the 
collection of resources, the Pension Fund can increase the 
amount of payments to groups of the population that are poorly 
protected against inflation? 
  [Nazarov] Correct. But, unfortunately, we are still 
collecting much less than we could. After all, many enterprises 
are on the brink of bankruptcy. Many large enterprises are our 
debtors: R8 billion for the fishermen, R5 billion for 
enterprises of the defense complex and R4 billion for the 
Ministry of Defense, and R3 billion for the nonferrous metals 
industry--for a total of R26 billion. Under an optimal variant, 
we receive up to R40 billion. Our task consists precisely of 
collecting, controlling, and using these resources. On the 
whole, we transfer up to R27 billion to social protection 
organs. We levy fines on enterprises that hide their 
indebtedness, and we direct the sums received for social 
protection [one or two lines missing] last year we gave R1.768 
billion for these purposes. In addition, R1.325 billion went 
for rendering material assistance; for health improvement and 
convalescence of participants and invalids of the Great 
Patriotic War--R56 million; and for boarding school houses and 
shelters and for their reconstruction and the construction of 
new buildings of this designation--R121 million. The Red Cross 
and the organization of medical-social assistance to solitary 
people and people of old age at home received R10 million. One 
hundred million rubles were given directly to social security 
departments. 
  [Permyakova] In light of the inflation, these figures could 
prove to be inadequate.... 
  [Nazarov] This year we plan to transfer R6 billion for all 
such needs, and a billion was already given for the first 
quarter by 20 February. 
  [Permyakova] It is no secret that many enterprises are 
really in catastrophic condition and are increasing the 
percentage of so-called hidden unemployment, when people are 
forcefully sent on leave without maintenance. How can they 
settle accounts with you? 
  [Nazarov] We take all of this into consideration. If an 
enterprise is trying to be honest with us and with its own 
workers, we give an extension. But those who have enough money 
both for wages and construction, but who evade payment of the 
pension tax--we fine these harshly, and Moscow is requiring 
tough measures from us. In 1993, we exacted R3.869 billion from 
violators. At the same time, the government decided to forgive 
the indebtedness of those enterprises [line missing] that cannot 
pay their workers even the minimum wage.... 
  [Permyakova] Pavel Mikhaylovich, the attention of our 
readers was attracted by a note in one of the city newspapers, 
"Do not take money from grandmothers." Some people understood 
this to mean that the Pension Fund does not support them.... Is 
it possible that the notorious Pension Fund also takes from old 
people? 
  [Nazarov] In no way! A pension tax is not collected on any 
kind of stipends, benefits, and pensions! In this case, the 
question exactly concerns the concealment of one's incomes and 
corresponding indebtedness to the Pension Fund of a large number 
of enterprises, owing to which pensioners also do not receive 
what they have coming to them. But, by the way, the Pension 
Fund itself does not engage either in the payment of pensions, 
or in rendering social assistance to the indigent strata of the 
population. These things, as I have already mentioned, are 
handled by the social protection organs, but we finance them. 
For the payment of pensions in the kray, R137.5 billion were 
expended from PFR resources, and for social protection--R1.768 
billion (while the note for some reason indicates a total of 
R120 million, which constituted allegedly 60 percent of what was 
planned). It should be known that only resources collected from 
violators are directed to the social protection of the aged. 
The work will be perfected, control will be improved on the 
part of our employees, the sums of fines will be increased, and, 
consequently, more resources will be directed to social 
protection [line missing] Pension Fund is established in order 
that its resources go only for the needs of the people of scanty 
means. This money is kept in banks; we do not see the cash, it 
can be used temporarily only by the bank, and last year we 
received R1.560 billion from banks for the use of our resources, 
and we paid various taxes of R510 million into the budget. 
  [Permyakova] Pavel Mikhaylovich, one more, indelicate 
question, which an American would not answer. But life is life, 
and as long as the majority is infringed upon in its earnings, 
people cannot help but be interested in what the average wage of 
your workers is. 
  [Nazarov] Well, it is a good and lawful question. First, I 
will note that we do not set the wages for ourselves; they are 
established by Moscow--by the federal organs of social 
administration. Yes, we have a decent wage. It is R275,000, 
and we hope that it will grow. We take into account years of 
service, and we add on bonuses. For what? Workers of the 
Pension Fund monitor 26,000 enterprises of various types [two 
lines missing] 8,551, and of these, violations of established 
payment procedures were disclosed in 7,516 (and this is 88 
percent of the number that were checked!) and about R4 million 
was recovered! Each worker of our fund has to make 50 
checkups--almost as much as there are weeks in a year. Numerous 
beginning commercial structures try especially hard to evade tax 
payments, and we find them through the banks and tax 
inspectorates. It happens that they tear up our acts there, 
threaten and taunt us, muddle up accounts, although all that 
they have to do is to calculate wages, transfer 28 percent from 
the monthly incomes of enterprises and 1 percent from each 
worker. But no, almost everyone is a violator. But after all, 
each of us will sooner or later move into the pensioner 
category.... 
  [Permyakova] Have you, Pavel Mikhaylovich, been associated 
with the financial structure for a long time? 
  [Nazarov] I am a financier to the marrow of my bones. I 
graduated from a financial institute more than 30 years ago. I 
worked in a bank for 13 years as chief [line missing] of the 
financial administration of the kray executive committee, and 
from 1991 I became the manager of the Pension Fund. I was born 
in Amur Oblast, and I have been living in Vladivostok since 1955.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Filippov, IZVESTIYA staff: "Arkhangelsk </F>
Politicians Do Their Jobs and Do Not Fight With Anyone"] 
  [Text] Arkhangelsk--Arkhangelsk is like Odessa in felt 
boots: people are never at a loss for words here, either. The 
impressive building of the oblast party committee, located, as 
it should be, int he very center of the city, has been 
sarcastically dubbed the "accordion." Not so much for its 
architecture as for the "music" that came out of it, music to 
which the entire Maritime Oblast used to dance. The nickname was 
kept during the time of the building's next tenant: the oblast 
soviet. Evidently its "music" too closely resembled the party 
music. 
  And since last 12 December the famous building became the 
residence of the new representative authority--on that day 
Maritime Oblast residents elected their oblast assembly. Whether 
the ironic legacy will attach itself to the assembly, we won't 
try to guess. So far, people in Arkhangelsk speak of their 
parliament without irony. And we also will take a look at it 
with serious eyes, since such elections lie ahead for other 
regions of Russia, as well. 
<H6>  Mirror of the Russian Provinces </H6>
  Thirty-five deputies were elected to the 41 seats in the 
Arkhangelsk Oblast Assembly. Elections of six more are to be 
completed at the end of March. The new deputy corps has provided 
some idea of what can be expected from province authorities 
today. 
  First of all, professionalism. The communist patriots' 
favorite argument about the cook a the helm of state has been 
totally refuted. All the deputies to the oblast assembly have 
higher-school diplomas and are between 30 and 60 years of age, 
which is considered the most productive for work. Fifteen 
deputies are executives of industrial, construction and 
agricultural enterprises, eight are from rayon and rural 
administrations, and the rest are physicians, teachers, lawyers 
and journalists. 
  Second, the province clearly does not want a revival of 
Soviet practices. Only nine of the legislators out of 35 were 
formerly deputies to a soviet. 
  And third, the voters are hoping that their deputies will 
engage in lawmaking, not political struggle. Maritime Oblast 
inhabitants have elected to their oblast assembly only those who 
have not linked themselves unreservedly to any one party or 
movement. 
  "We don't have any factions," says Nikolay Isakov, chairman 
of the oblast assembly. "We have come here in order to put the 
oblast's economy in order, and one's political coloring is 
unimportant for economic laws. 
<H6>  Speaker-Diplomat </H6>
  Nikolay Isakov is 47 years of age. He was born on the Pinega 
River and is a fellow countryman of the writer Fedor Abramov. 
And he himself is an exceptional person for the Arkhangelsk 
backwoods. He was graduated from the Friendship of People's 
University in Moscow, is a historian and economist by training, 
and is fluent in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. He worked in 
Cuba on the staff of an economic adviser. Then he governed 
Pinezhskiy Rayon as head of the administration. It was through 
his diligence that a museum was opened in Fedor Abramov's house 
in the village of Verkola, and that a granite monument was 
placed on the writer's grave. The rayon chief has accomplished a 
number of other, perhaps more prosaic, but equally good deeds, 
for which Pinezhskiy Rayon's inhabitants elected him to the 
oblast parliament. And when the assembly's deputies were 
deciding who should be speaker, Nikolay Isakov proved to be 
without competitors. 
  "There is nothing for us to divide up with the executive 
authority," Nikolay Isakov believes. "The oblast administration 
is working hard to enable the producer of goods to operate 
normally. And we will use the means at our disposal to try to 
accomplish the same objective. Saving jobs in remote areas means 
saving the people who live there. But where are the muzhiks in a 
forest village to go if their only timber station closes. And 
what will they feed their children?" 
  An interesting note: the "accordion" has its own cafeteria, 
but the speaker has made a habit of dining in the oblast 
administration building, with the governor. According to Nikolay 
Isakov, it is better to go over common problems in an informal 
atmosphere. 
<H6>  Not a Word About Privileges </H6>
  Of the 41 deputies to the oblast assembly, 16 may work on a 
permanent basis. But only three professionals have joined the 
speaker and two deputy speakers. The rest of the deputies have 
not quit their jobs. The deputies meet in Arkhangelsk only once 
a month--for a session that lasts five days. 
  The oblast assembly began its work at the same time as the 
State Duma. But while their colleagues in Moscow were arguing 
over what privileges to establish for themselves, the 
Arkhangelsk legislators were concerned with the socioeconomic 
state of the oblast, its budget, local tax rates and the 
structure of local government. None of the deputies said a word 
about privileges for themselves. 
  "It's disgraceful, to stuff one's own pockets at the expense 
of the impoverished people," Nikolay Isakov says. 
  The Arkhangelsk parliament lives modestly. Only the chairman 
has an official car. The deputies are reimbursed for their hotel 
and travel to sessions. They also have the free use of city 
transportation, except for taxis, of course. The oblast 
assembly's staff is half the size of the deputy corps. Those who 
work on a permanent basis receive salaries: the speaker's is 
equal to the governor's, his deputies get the same as the 
vice-governor, the chairman of a standing commission gets the 
same as the director of an administration, and so forth. 
  "Sensible deputies have been elected," says Governor Pavel 
Balakshin. "This is no longer the same thing as the former 
oblast soviet, which contrived to govern everything. I express 
my own position at sessions of the oblast assembly, and even if 
it differs from the deputies', we find agreement." 
  Nonetheless, I am wary of drawing the conclusion that the 
elections of local parliaments that are slated for the end of 
March in many regions of Russia will bring long-awaited 
political peace as has been the case in Arkhangelsk. Practically 
everywhere, heads and deputy heads of administrations of various 
levels are running for deputies. Seven of such "dual job 
holders" have gotten onto the Arkhangelsk Oblast Assembly. 
However, it is not out of the question that the dual job holders 
will take the majority in the parliaments of other oblasts, and 
that the representative branch will be suppressed by the 
executive branch. Consequently, autocratic regimes may be 
established on part of Russian territory. 
  Our country has many faces, and there is no doubt that the 
regions' bodies of representative authority should be in accord 
with their historical traditions. But at the same time, there is 
a need for a federal law on the general principles of local 
authority that would guarantee the indivisibility of Russia. And 
it makes good sense that the March elections in the regions 
should be postponed until the time when the State Duma adopts 
such a law.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Petrov: "The Future Is for the APR [Agrarian </F>
Party of Russia], Believe Oblast Conference Delegates"] 
  [Text] The regional section of the Agrarian Party of 
Russia, is perhaps the youngest in the multiparty list of the 
Smolensk region. Organizationally, it was formed a little over a 
month ago. However, in its numbers (around 400 members), the APR 
is far from being in last place. And this is understandable: Our 
oblast has long been called agrarian. Moreover, the APR won a 
certain authority in Russia during the elections to the State 
Duma, where it received representation among eight parties and 
movements. Organizations of the APR have been created in 70 
regions of Russia. 
  This fact was reiterated at the recently held oblast 
conference of the APR. The chairman of the party organization, 
A. S. Ignatenkov, justifying the need for unification of 
agrarians of the Smolensk region into a party, recalled the 
oblast conference on agriculture which was held two years ago. 
Even at that time the conclusion was drawn that reforms are 
being implemented not in the interests of the farm workers. A 
coordinating committee was elected, which prepared documents 
containing proposals and demands of the rural residents to the 
local administration and the government, organized picketing, 
etc. The result was zero. Evidently, they made the rounds of the 
offices and pleaded in vain. It was necessary to opt for extreme 
measures--not to supply products. But, on the other hand, the 
coordinating committee did not have any powers and authorities. 
The creation of the party introduces the work on defending the 
interests of the peasantry into a constitutional channel. This 
was the specific guideline during the creation of the APR by its 
founders, among which the main role belonged to the trade unions 
and the Ministry of Agriculture. A. Rutskoy was also of great 
help. 
  What is the APR trying to achieve, and what are its tasks 
today? First of all, it is necessary to stop the disintegration 
and the pilferage of agricultural structures which had been 
decades in the making. The head of the Smolensk organization of 
the APR, A. S. Ignatenkov, has long been well known, including 
also outside the oblast, as the chairman of the leading kolkhoz 
"Zarya" in Pochinkovskiy Rayon. The achievements of this farm in 
the sphere of production as well as in the social-domestic 
sphere were widely publicized not only in the local, but also in 
the central press. However, in the words of A. S. Ignatenkov, it 
was not necessary to do anything brilliant in order to obtain 40 
quintals of grain crops from a hectare and a 4,000 liter milk 
yield. The main thing was that a good material base was created 
and, were it not for the reforms, not tens but hundreds of farms 
in the oblast would have such indicators today. We could feed 
not only ourselves, but Poland too. Yet today even the recent 
"beacons" cannot make ends meet: The problem lies in selling the 
produced product, in getting money for it. 
  The statements of farm managers F. S. Vasilyev and V. D. 
Komarova, who are well known in the Smolensk region, resounded 
with concern already for the near future of the farm. Oblast 
leaders today have forgotten their pre-electoral promises to see 
to the needs of the peasants. Despite the invitations, not one 
administration representative came to the conference. To hear 
them talk--everything is fine with us. Yet catastrophe is not 
far away--there is simply nothing with which to sow the current 
Spring planting in the Smolensk region, not to mention the 
problems with equipment, spare parts and fuel. Where and for 
what means are the current joint-stock companies supposed to buy 
all of this, if even an excellent flax crop, for which medals 
were given before, brings only losses? 
  The APR does not have time for political discussions. It 
does 
not aspire to any bright color in today's political spectrum. 
Its goals and tasks are in keeping with those facing the trade 
unions. And it is no accident that the trade unions are among 
the founders of the party, and it is no accident that at the 
conference (it was held in the oblsovprof [oblast soviet of 
trade unions]) the tasks for creating and stepping up the 
actions of the local APR organizations were placed before the 
trade union raykom [rayon committee] chairmen. 
  Speaking at the conference, the oblast committee chairman of 
the trade union of workers in the agricultural industry, V. A. 
Yakovlev (he is also the co-chairman of the oblast organization 
of the APR), noted that the APR is a party not only of farm 
workers, but of everyone who holds dear the needs of our farms. 
Ultimately, the well-being of everyone depends on the degree to 
which these needs are met. This is specifically why the future 
is for the APR. And we do not need to forcefully drag anyone 
into the party, to inflate its membership numbers. The Agrarian 
Party is open to constructive cooperation with all parties and 
movements, but will not itself seek alliance with anyone. For 
now, the agrarians are in closest contact with the communists. 
  A separate point on the conference agenda was the question 
of 
nominating candidates to the oblast duma. An agreement was 
reached on support of previously nominated candidates by the 
APR. It turned out that among these were also the heads of the 
Rudnanskiy, Pochinkovskiy and Kholm-Chirkovskiy administrations. 
The candidates for deputy in the oblast duma nominated by the 
APR were P. Ye. Demyanov (Yartsevo) and V. A. Yakovlev. 
  An oblast organization council was created at the 
conference, 
and all participations were given party tickets of a pleasant 
green color. We have only to hope that the Agrarian Party will 
be able to help the peasants as well as us, the city residents, 
to live through the current difficult times.

<F P=106> [Interview with Veniamin Nikolayevich Potapov, chairman of </F>
the Smolensk city executive committee of the CPRF [Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation], conducted by P. Privalov: "The 
Salvation of Russia Stands Above Differences of Opinion"] 
  [Text] 
  [Begin boxed material] 
  After the elections to the Federal Assembly of the Russian 
Federation, a bold expression became popular: "The second coming 
of the communists." For many, the success of the CPRF in the 
elections turned out to be perhaps no less unexpected than the 
triumph of the party of Zhirinovskiy. As we know, the CPRF 
collected 14.78 percent of the votes cast in the election in the 
Smolensk region. Although this was less than half of what the 
LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] got, nevertheless--it 
is the second result. What do the communists themselves think of 
this? Our correspondent posed this question to the chairman of 
the Smolensk city executive committee of the CPRF, Veniamin 
Nikolayevich Potapov. 
  [End boxed material] 
  [Potapov] First of all, I believe that most of them who did 
not approve of the decision of Zyuganov's party regarding 
participation in the elections were convinced that we were 
right. The results of the voting took the ground out from under 
the feet of politicians who say that Russia is through with 
communism. Real prerequisites have been created for a normal and 
fruitful discussion of an ideological character, without 
application of labels and insults. 
  Of course, the "second coming of the communists" is a bit 
overstated. Fifteen percent, you must agree, is not all that 
much. However, the "Choice of Russia" got even less. 
Nevertheless, the entire mass media is at its service: Radio, 
television, and SMOLENSKIYE NOVOSTI. I pick up a random copy of 
SN. There is a published sampling of five letters commenting on 
the results of the election. Four of the letters are in support 
of the president and "Choice of Russia" and one is about the 
LDPR. Moreover, the last one is written in such a way that, I 
believe, does not want no make anyone want to have anything to 
do with the "Zhirinovsky followers." Yet, as experience shows, 
it is useless for us to submit our material to SMOLENSKIYE 
NOVOSTI. 
  [Correspondent] Much has been said recently about democracy, 
pluralism, freedom of speech, and so forth. How do you explain 
the situation which has arisen? 
  [Potapov] Lenin already explained everything, and very well. 
The press and other mass media are always partisan. The always 
express the interests of certain classes and social groups. They 
are always dependant on the publisher, on bribes, on support, on 
the moneybag, etc. Once again we have become convinced of this. 
  [Correspondent] So, perhaps you should follow Lenin's path 
and create your own ISKRA?... 
  [Potapov] That is easy to say. Today even the major 
newspapers, as you know, cannot make ends meet. What can you say 
about us, who have no money? It is good that the CPRF is somehow 
able to publish NASHA GAZETA in Safonov for certain major events 
and campaigns. We print leaflets and distribute party 
literature. We see our main task in the propaganda of our views. 
  [Correspondent] And is this all that the city organization 
of 
the CPRF is doing today? 
  [Potapov] We are actively participating in the elections, 
supporting our candidates, collecting funds for a memorial to 
Terkin... In general, however, it is not easy for us today. It 
is not simply that there is a chronic shortage of monetary 
funds. We do not even have our own accommodations. Despite 
repeated appeals to Mayor M. G. Zysmanov, the city mayor's 
office has not considered the fact that we are speaking about a 
public organization numbering around 700 members for the present 
day, and has not resolved this question. Negotiations are 
currently being conducted with the oblast property fund 
regarding the question of our leasing accommodations in a 
building on Krupskaya Street. For the present, however, the 
acceptance of new members and the reregistration of communists 
is a practically impossible task: There is nowhere to turn. 
  [Correspondent] Evidently, this is a common problem for all 
local sections of various parties? 
  [Potapov] I would not say so. In the House of Political 
Enlightenment which was built with party funds (currently a 
music school), facilities have been allocated for parties whose 
members in the Smolensk area may be counted on one's fingers. To 
put it mildly, we are encountering a certain prejudice in regard 
to the communist party on the part of the authorities. And this 
despite the fact that we are being controlled by party card 
holders. 
  [Correspondent] Call them "turncoats," as the readers do in 
their letters to the newspaper, and we will put an end to the 
subject. 
  [Potapov] Turncoats--that is too simplified. Just look, 
practically all the leaders of the current parties were formerly 
members of the CPSU. And how they have scattered! The communist 
party has always had, as a minimum, two camps. In one there were 
those who said about Russia and the Union, "that country." They 
were the destroyers. In the other were the ones who said "our 
country," the builders. The struggle between them may be viewed 
literally over the entire duration of the party's history. The 
most striking example is the debunking of Leo Trotsky's theory 
of the permanent revolution. In translation, "permanent 
revolution" is continuous destruction. The proponents of this 
theory are currently implementing it in practice under the mark 
of radical market reforms. Moreover, having brought us out onto 
the beaten path of "world civilization," our leaders are 
concealing the fact that our crisis is taking place on the basis 
of the world crisis. In the Summer of 1992, a conference of 
heads of state and governments was held in Buenos Aires, where 
the synonymous conclusion was drawn that if world civilization 
follows the Western path of development, it will find itself in 
a dead end. And why do we need to go there? 
  [Correspondent] Nevertheless, even within the communist camp 
there is no unified opinion regarding an alternative path. 
  [Potapov] Yes, there are differences of opinion. They are 
being manifested also in the Smolensk region. But the city 
organization of the CPRF believed and still believes that now is 
not the time for interparty, and particularly intraparty, 
sorting out. We are open to cooperation with everyone who speaks 
out against the shock policy of the current government, for whom 
it is not differences of opinion which stand above all else, but 
the salvation of Russia. During the electoral campaign, we also 
collected signatures in favor of the Russian All-People's Union, 
helped the party of the cadets, the "Dignity and Charity" 
movement, and certain others. Today we consider our closest 
allies to be the Agrarian Party of Russia, the patriotic 
movement and the Smolensk Popular Assembly. 
  [Correspondent] There are rumors circulating about certain 
contacts of the CPRF with the party of Zhirinovskiy. 
  [Potapov] We have not had any dialogue with the LDPR. If 
they 
agree to it, we, for our part, are not opposed. We may say the 
same also of the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia]. In general, 
however, we are more worried today about the problems of the 
upcoming elections to the oblast duma and the organs of local 
self-government. We are proposing already in the near future to 
hold an oblast conference of the CPRF, to hear the report of the 
executive organs, to define our pre-electoral platform. We 
believe that the results of the December elections could be more 
favorable for us if the supreme administrative organ of the 
oblast CPRF worked out a preliminary decision on tactics and 
candidates. This has not been done. I believe we must learn from 
mistakes.

<F P=106> [Report, under the rubric "The Authorities and the </F>
Opposition," on interview with Viktor Arkadyevich Tyulkin, first 
secretary of the Russian Communist Workers' Party, conducted by 
V. Snisarenko; date and place not given; also excerpts from 
Tyulkin's statements first published in VECHERNIY LENINGRAD] 
  [Text] Although central Russian newspapers wrote not 
a line about this, the first secretary of the Russian Communist 
Workers' Party (RKRP), V. Tyulkin, made a short working visit to 
Tyumen during these last few days. 
  Possibly it is because the number of RKRP members is 
now equal to the number of subscribers to TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA, 
but all the same it was to the editorial office of TYUMENSKAYA 
PRAVDA that Viktor Arkadyevich made a visit in the first hours 
after his arrival in the Tyumen region, and he answered the 
questions of the newspaper's political commentator, V. 
Snisarenko, openly and completely frankly. 
  Anticipating the above-mentioned conversation, TP 
[TYUMENKSAYA PRAVDA] offers readers excerpts from recent 
statements by V. Tyulkin, the texts of which were published on 
the pages of the January issues of the newspaper VECHERNIY 
LENINGRAD. 
  On the work of the current State Duma: "The opposition 
represented by the party called the RF Communist Party, the 
Agrarian Party, and others will not play a fundamental role for 
two reasons: a) because the inefficiency of the Duma is laid in 
its very mechanism (not one decision will be adopted without the 
president's approval); and b) because in themselves the 
opposition parties are essentially unable to fight for the 
fundamental interests of working people and are at best focused 
on passive defense." 
  From the statement of the organizational bureau of the RKRP 
Central Committee, signed by V. Tyulkin: "In violation of the 
Law `On the RF Referendum' and generally accepted norms of 
civilized states, Boris Yeltsin conducted a kind of population 
poll. Defending the people's right to independently decide their 
fate and relying on current legislation, the RKRP cannot 
recognize the diktat of the minority which has seized power in 
the country and is appealing the results of the poll to the 
Supreme Court of Russia (in accordance with Article 35 of the 
Law `On the Referendum')." 
  On the predictions for a radiant future: "... We should 
expect maximum reinforcement of all components of the repressive 
apparatus: the police, the procurator's office, the courts, the 
political police, political investigation, and censorship... I 
very much regret having to predict the appearance of something 
like political terrorism in 1994. The regime has overstepped the 
line of legality too far, and too many people no longer believe 
in any possibility of civilized, reasonable talk, accusing the 
communists and the patriots of speech making, naivete, and 
constraining the energy of the masses. Unfortunately, these 
forces of resistance may appear." 
  And here is what we were able to learn on a number of other 
questions during our in-person talk with him. 
  On the lack of unity between the RKRP and the RF Communist 
Party: In the opinion of V. Tyulkin, the leadership of the 
present RF Communist Party consists of those people whom "Boris 
Nikolayevich classifies as sensible communists, people with whom 
he is prepared to sit down and has already sat down at the 
negotiations table." In practice only the RF CP leadership, in 
V. Tyulkin's opinion, has to a certain extent betrayed the 
ideals of the communist movement, in fact redirecting it onto 
the opportunistic footing of social democracy. And we should not 
talk about disagreements between the concepts and views of the 
situation among ordinary members based on their related parties. 
Ultimately this internal unity will still make itself known. 
  On immediate plans: To actively participate in the local 
election campaign for the organs of representative power. The 
final goal is the Councils of Working People (although V. 
Tyulkin even acknowledged that "Yeltsin's people managed to make 
great progress along the path of totally destroying the `labor 
unity' which even yesterday was powerful. To work toward 
increasing the number of local party members. 
  Let us assume that tomorrow the RKRP wins the elections and 
takes power in the RF into its hands. What will the first steps 
of its authority be?: To immediately suspend present-day 
privatization. Present-day millionaires and billionaires will 
have to report on the legitimacy of their wealth. To take the 
present structure of commercial banks under strict control, 
restoring the controlling monopoly of the Central Bank of the 
Russian Federation in this sphere. In addition, to immediately 
take steps to fight corruption and crime. 
  In light of this, V. Tyulkin explained that abandoning the 
privatization now being conducted by the present regime does not 
mean taking any repressive steps against those who are honestly 
engaged in business on the level of private property or joint 
stock forms of commodity production. 
  To summarize the RKRP position overall, it may be defined as 
total opposition to the present authorities and to the course of 
economic reforms they are conducting. 
  V. Tyulkin said the purpose of his present trip through the 
regions of Russia is to familiarize himself with the situation 
locally and with the sentiments in labor collectives, as well as 
to make the activity of the basic organizations of the RKRP more 
concrete. He confirmed that in protecting the interests of the 
working masses, the party stands and will continue to stand on 
the cornerstone principles of the Leninist RSDRP [Russian Social 
Democratic Workers' Party]. That is what he said.

<F P=106> [Text of press conference given on 14 Feb by Yuriy </F>
Vasilyevich Neyelov, newly appointed acting chief of 
administration of Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, recorded by 
V. Grachev] 
  [Text] On 14 Feb the editorial office received the 
edict of the RF president on the appointment of Yu. Neyelov as 
acting chief of administration of Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous 
Okrug. The very same day Yuriy Vasilyevich decided it was 
necessary to give a press conference for the journalists of 
oblast newspapers. 
  The new top leader of the okrug announced that he prefers to 
give preemptive answers to inevitable questions related to his 
new appointment himself. And he spoke with journalists fairly 
openly without giving an answer to one question: For what 
specific transgressions was the former chief of administration 
of Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, Lev Bayandin, dismissed from 
the post. "You have to ask those who prepared the edict about 
that," Yu. Neyelov said diplomatically. 
  Yuriy Vasilyevich announced that he has in fact already 
begun 
to perform his new duties. Today he met with a large delegation 
from RAO [Russian Joint Stock Company] Gazprom, headed by its 
manager R. E. Vyakhirev. Yesterday was quite productive. Among 
other things, the question of the bad situation which has taken 
shape in Salekhard was closed. There, as our newspaper already 
reported, residential buildings froze up (read the details in 
the next issue of TP [TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA]), and there are other 
problems related to poor preparation for the winter. Gazprom is 
allocating money to clean up the consequences of this situation 
as soon as possible and prevent more problems. There were talks 
about resolving the problem of lack of payments too, among 
others on Ukraine's large debt to Novyy Urengoy for gas 
delivered. A plan has been arrived at--Ukraine settles accounts 
in goods, the goods are sold, and the money goes to pay off the 
debt to the gas workers in wages. 
  The new chief of the okrug administration explained why 
under 
the edict he is "only" the acting chief. It turns out that "at 
the top" this procedure has been established--all the recent 
appointments to governors' posts have followed this same scheme, 
and he is no exception. 
  Yu. Neyelov also reported that he will run as a candidate 
for 
deputy to the Council of the Federation in one of the election 
districts in Yamal which remain vacant. 
  In answering the question to what degree the new 
appointments 
correspond to his personal plans, Yuriy Vasilyevich said that he 
had already been offered this post twice before and refused. He 
was persuaded the third time. The situation in the okrug now is 
bad, but he is a native of Yamal, he grew up here, his 
grandfather, grandmother, and father are buried here, and his 
mother lives here even now. He himself was born here. "I am 
returning to the home of my birth," said Yu. Neyelov. 
  Will the new chief of the okrug administration fulfill his 
former duties as deputy chief of the oblast administration as 
well? That was a very tricky question which was asked. The 
answer: If that is even suggested, I will not accept it. I know 
that talks are in progress on this subject with a very clear 
ulterior motive, said Yuriy Vasilyevich. I am returning to the 
home of my birth in order to reinforce its independence even 
more, but as part of a unified Tyumen Oblast. 
  The chief of administration was also asked how he intends to 
build his relations with the all-powerful RAO Gazprom, which has 
more power in the okrug than the authorities themselves. A year 
ago this theory would have perhaps been accurate, answered Yu. 
Neyelov. But now Gazprom is not so very powerful and has no 
money, but then there are many problems. He shared his 
interpretation of the paths of development of Yamal, the basis 
of which is bolstering legislative support for the economy of 
the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug. Ninety percent of Russia's 
natural gas is produced here, and the state does not have the 
right to refuse to try to solve Yamal problems, subcontracting 
them out only to joint stock structures. Consequently, a 
powerful corporation to develop the okrug economy on a mixed 
basis must be created: with the participation of the state, RAO 
Gazprom, petroleum associations, and the like. But this must in 
principle be a state corporation existing around 14-15 percent 
on deductions for oil and gas, as is customary throughout the 
world. 
  And, secondly, we need a state corporation of regional 
development which works for the needs of the indigenous peoples 
in the North. The situation in the tundra today is bad, the old 
system for supporting the indigenous peoples has been destroyed, 
and a new one has not yet taken shape--and it is now essentially 
a question of people's survival. After all, Russia signed an 
international convention on small aboriginal peoples, and hence 
they have the right to property and land and the right to 
dividends for using them. Chaotic, one-time injections of 
capital are not the point and do not solve the problem. Yu. 
Neyelov stated that he considers the solution to this problem to 
be his primary job. 
  To do this the structure of administration will be changed 
and scientists will be hired; this will also be reflected in the 
okrug's budget policy. 
  At the same time, however, Yuriy Vasilyevich noted that he 
is 
against the development of ancestral lands. As practice has 
shown, this results only in conflicts, which are at times 
bloody, among various groups of the population; other ways to 
solve the problem must be found. 
  The phrase "superfluous people must be removed from the 
North" has now become fashionable. What do you think of that? 
the new chief of the okrug administration was asked. According 
to all analyses, the okrug is overpopulated by about 20 percent, 
he answered. But people certainly cannot be "removed." People, 
especially those who have given the North many years of their 
lives and frequently their health, can and must be moved. They 
must be moved to places which are more accommodating to life, of 
course, and it must be done so that their lives are normal. RAO 
Gazprom, among other things, has such a program. 
  The new chief of administration is against moving the okrug 
capital from its historical site, Salekhard, to one of the new 
cities of gas or oil workers. But he is for bringing treaties 
with Ukraine, Belarus, and the republics on reinforcing the 
status of the migrant population in the okrug to a logical 
conclusion. The question of dual citizenship, for those who want 
it, and the questions of pensions, housing, and the like must be 
finally resolved. "We will improve all this only to the benefit 
of people's normal life," Yu. Neyelov stated. 
  The very same day the new chief of administration of 
Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug flew to Salekhard. And yesterday 
he took part in the big meeting of RAO Gazprom in Novyy 
Urengoy--here, as everyone knows, the very same events which 
occurred in Nadym recently are brewing. Yuriy Neyelov did not 
return at the best time for the home of his birth. All the more 
reason we wish him success, good fortune, and good sense in his 
new and responsible post.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Tarkayev, by A. Ganeyeva; place </F>
and date not given: "The Deal Here Was Opportune"] 
  [Text] The topic of the day throughout the past week 
continued to be the treaty "Delineation of Terms of Reference 
and Mutual Delegation of Authority Between Organs of State Power 
of the Russian Federation and Organs of State Power of the 
Republic of Tatarstan," which was signed by the presidents of 
Russia and Tatarstan. This exceptional event is being evaluated 
by the world community positively, in the main, but within our 
republic there are various opinions with regard to the document 
that has been signed. 
  We looked for comment in this connection from Aleksandr 
Tarkayev, chairman of the Trade and Industry Chamber of the 
Tatarstan Administrative Council and director of Dialog--one of 
Kazan's most important joint ventures. 
  "I believe that the signing of the treaty by the two 
presidents was a most important event in the relations of Russia 
and Tatarstan, more important even than it would appear to all 
of us, perhaps. I had a call today from a director of our 
affiliate in Yekaterinburg; he had read about the signing of the 
treaty in the newspaper. His reaction was as follows: 'How good 
an example you have set everyone of how it is possible to 
resolve the most difficult problems in civilized and peaceful 
fashion and within the framework of legality.' This has, truly, 
occurred in the CIS for the first time. 
  "This is the opinion of a person who understands pretty 
well, 
but who is not directly involved in political processes. 
  "The treaty is an example of the victory of common sense. 
Generally speaking, for me and business people it is not so much 
the content of the treaty as the mere fact of its appearance 
that is important. Business people have acquired firm ground 
beneath their feet, when there are, finally, no questions about 
separation and secession from the Russian Federation. 
  "We have truly achieved for ourselves that degree of freedom 
that we wanted, although with certain cuts, of course, inasmuch 
as this is a compromise. We would have liked somewhat more, 
perhaps. But ultimately each side obtained as much as it was 
able to bargain for itself in the course of the protracted 
negotiating process. And there should be no embarrassment at 
this word, because negotiations are, truly, bargaining. I 
believe that the treaty will represent a very sound basis for 
the further rapprochement of Russia and Tatarstan." 
  [Ganeyeva] What, in your view, will this treaty do for the 
economy of Tatarstan? 
  [Tarkayev] Deciding many questions will be far simpler for 
us 
now on the basis of this treaty. Today international 
organizations are investing enormous sums along the lines of 
every conceivable Western investment fund--the Bank of 
Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank, and others. And 
they are moving via the Russian Government--and almost all these 
resources are passing Tatarstan by. And it is not only a 
question of money here, but of involvement in particular 
processes of European structures also. 
  I have observed repeatedly that Tatarstan is a republic with 
very strong ties to the defense industry. Our 
military-industrial complex is, in any event, inseparably tied 
to Russia's "defense." The settlement of relations with Russia 
by this treaty will, in addition, provide a base for the future 
of tens of thousands of people who work in the defense industry. 
And how their children are fed and clothed will depend to a 
large extent on the state of the defense industry and, 
consequently, relations with Russia. 
  [Ganeyeva] Calling for a boycott of the coming elections, 
deputies of the Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan from national 
parties and movements are explaining this by the fact that there 
cannot be real sovereignty when the leadership of one republic 
is part of the leadership of another state. What is your 
attitude toward the elections? 
  [Tarkayev] I have a positive attitude toward the elections, 
because Tatarstan has never imagined itself separate from 
Russia. When the leaders of the national movement tell me that 
in a separate republic we would create our own Kuwait, I tell 
them quite sharply: They would, at best, create a Lesotho or 
Transkei. Never would they create a Kuwait inside Russia and as 
part of Russia. 
  I view the treaty positively for the added reason that I 
believe that it should be on the one hand truly a real subject 
of election debate and that, on the other, we will see with our 
own eyes what kind of support the nationalists have in reality. 
  And, finally, what is most important from the legal 
standpoint. 
  What is sovereignty? It is the supremacy of the say of a 
particular part of the people. If this people approves the 
treaty and votes in favor of representatives of the republic 
being part of the Federal Assembly, and if it sends Shaymiyev, 
Mukhametshin, or Lozovoy there, what is there more to be said in 
this connection by Bayramova or Tarkayev? 
  So the coming elections should clear up a great deal and put 
things in their place.

<F P=106> [Article prepared by Chelyabinsk Oblast Statistical </F>
Administration: "The Socioeconomic Situation of Chelyabinsk 
Oblast in 1993"] 
  [Text] The oblast's socioeconomic situation did not 
stabilize in 1993. By the end of the year there were positive 
tendencies in industry (the rates of reduction of production 
volumes slowed up) and trade (the growth rate of retail 
commodity turnover in the oblast during the half year surpassed 
the preceding year's level). But toward the end of the year the 
situation became more difficult. The results of the year are 
characterized by a considerable reduction of production volumes 
and investment activity, a crisis of mutual nonpayments of 
enterprises, high rates of inflation, and an appreciable decline 
of the standard of living of the population. 
  The basic indicators characterizing the oblast's 
socioeconomic situation in 1993:

<H5>  FINANCES </H5>
  Over 11 months enterprises and organizations of the oblast 
received 1.1188 trillion rubles [R] in profit. As compared to 
the corresponding period of last year there was an 8.7-fold 
increase in profit. As of 1 December all branches of the 
national economy had achieved a positive financial result. 
  According to the results of their operation, every eleventh 
enterprise sustained losses. The proportion of enterprises 
operating at a loss was great. In computer service--33.3 
percent, housing and municipal services--30.8 percent, and 
publishing houses--50 percent. 
  As of 1 December 1993 monetary funds in the working accounts 
of the enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, 
transportation, and agriculture amounted to R77.1 billion. Of 
this amount, 82 percent of the money was in industry. On the 
whole the monetary funds available to the enterprises cover the 
volume of their defaulted indebtedness to suppliers by only 16 
percent. 
  As usual, the problem of mutual settlements among 
enterprises 
remains critical. Credit indebtedness among these branches 
amounted to R1.717 trillion, of which about 40 percent was 
defaulted indebtedness. The share of industrial enterprises in 
the overall volume of defaulted indebtedness by suppliers 
amounted to 90 percent. Considerable amounts of defaulted credit 
indebtedness were related to the existence of debit indebtedness. 
  As of 1 December 1993 debit indebtedness amounted to R1.7907 
trillion, of which R758.9 billion (42.4 percent) was defaulted. 
A large part of it was defaulted indebtedness of buyers--R689.5 
billion. 
  The shortage of financial resources of the enterprises is 
covered to a considerable degree by bank credit. The overall 
amount of indebtedness on bank credit in the branches that were 
examined amounted to R254 billion, including in industry--R143.2 
billion (56.4 percent). Indebtedness on loans that were received 
amounted to R31.2 billion, of which 86.8 percent was in industry. 
  As a result of the lack of money in the working accounts 
there continues to be growth of defaulted indebtedness on funds 
granted for consumption. As of 1 January 1994 this sum in 
industry, construction, and agriculture amounted to R31.7 
million, which is 1.3 times more than during the entire 11 
months. 
<H5>  PRIVATIZATION </H5>
  Over the year documents were filled out for the 
privatization 
of 1,023 facilities, including 703 municipally owned enterprises 
(68.7 percent of the overall number of enterprises, 90 owned by 
the oblast (8.8 percent), and 230 federally owned (22.5 percent). 
  The overall value of the property of privatized enterprises 
exceeds R172.1 billion. Privatization is proceeding most 
actively with municipally owned enterprises. 
  A total of 255 enterprises are being converted into 
joint-stock companies--this is one-fourth of the enterprises 
that submitted documents for privatization. Of the three 
versions of benefits offered to the labor collectives, 
preference is given to the second version which enables the 
labor collective to have a controlling block of shares. This 
version of benefits was chosen by 70 percent of the enterprises 
that became joint-stock companies. 
  About R18 billion in capital was received from 
privatization, 
which is 3.4 times more than during the first half of 1993. Most 
of the capital (about 60 percent) remains on the territory of 
the oblast. 
  Last year 183,800 apartments were privatized in the oblast. 
As compared to 1992 their number increased 1.6-fold. Since the 
beginning of privatization (1989-1993) 299,000 apartments have 
been privatized, which is 35.8 percent of the overall number of 
apartments subject to privatization. 
<H5>  LEVEL AND INDEXES OF PRICES AND RATES </H5>
  The consolidated consumer price index for the full 
range of goods and services in December 1993 as compared to 
December 1992 amounted to 1,024.6 percent. 
  During the course of the year consumer prices and rates rose 
most rapidly for paid services rendered to the population. In 
December 1993 as compared to December 1992 they increased 
48.1-fold, including services of a legal nature--664.3-fold, of 
cultural institutions--170.4-fold, and housing and municipal 
services--60.2-fold. 
  A decisive impact on the growth of overall consumer prices 
was made by the change in prices of foodstuffs, which make up a 
large proportion of them. In December 1993 as compared to 
December 1992 consumer prices for food products increased 
9.1-fold, including vegetables--22.2-fold, potatoes--19.2-fold, 
eggs--18.3-fold, fruits and vegetables--12.3-fold, bread and 
bakery items--12.1-fold, and milk and dairy products--11.9-fold. 
Consumer prices for nonfood commodities increased less than 
those of food commodities. With respect to this type of goods 
there were sharp price increases for medications (54.3-fold), 
household chemical items (20.5-fold), children's footwear 
(12.4-fold), hosiery items (12.2-fold), rubber footwear 
(11.7-fold), construction materials (11.5-fold), and knitted 
underwear (10.9-fold). 
  The consolidated retail price index for consumer 
goods of the trade network in 1993 as compared to 1992 
amounted to 1,085.6 percent. Prices increased most for nonfood 
commodities--11.6-fold, including for medications and chemical 
products--23-fold, glass dishware--19-fold, paper and office 
supplies--16-fold, rubber footwear and toys--15-fold, passenger 
cars and leather and textile-combined footwear--14-fold, and 
headgear, haberdashery, and household chemicals--13-fold. 
  On the whole in 1993 as compared to 1992 prices of 
foodstuffs 
increased 10.4-fold, including for herring--16-fold, meat and 
poultry--15-fold, canned fish and vegetables--14-fold, sausage 
items, fish, lard, potatoes, and vegetables--13-fold, margarine 
and margarine products, milk and dairy products, cheese, tea, 
salt, and nonalcoholic beverages--12-fold, and canned meats, 
fruits, and ice cream--11-fold. 
  The level of prices and rates of services in the 
sphere of consumer services increased 18.3-fold on average for 
the oblast during the year. There was a sharp increase in the 
rates for services of notary institutions (692-fold). The higher 
prices of food products and municipal, transportation, and 
health services gave a powerful impetus to the growth of prices 
for tourist-excursion (18.5-fold) and sanatorium-health resort 
services (17-fold). During the past year prices and rates of 
consumer services increased 16.7-fold, of which the cost of dry 
cleaning services increased 27.4-fold, shoe repair--26.3-fold, 
ceremonial services--24.7-fold, tailoring of 
clothing--20.6-fold, and bath services--17-fold. There was a 
sharp increase in prices for services of institutions of culture 
(30.8-fold) and public health (13.8-fold). The cost of passenger 
transportation services increased 27.9-fold. As compared to last 
year there was an increase in the cost of airline tickets 
(45.9-fold) and railroad tickets (19.6-fold), and the cost of 
passenger travel on urban commuter transportation increased 
11-fold. There were appreciable increases in prices of 
communications services (10.8-fold) and housing and municipal 
services (9.6-fold). 
  The consolidated wholesale price index for industrial 
products for the set of representative commodities in 
December 1993 as compared to the preceding month was 107.8 
percent, and compared to December 1992--1,034.5 percent. 
Throughout the entire year there was a growth of wholesale 
prices in the food, meat, and dairy industry. In October the 
maximum growth of prices was observed in the bread baking 
industry (the index as compared to last month was 201.5 
percent), and in December there was a considerable increase in 
the butter and fat industry (146.7 percent). The increase in 
wholesale prices in all branches of industry brought about an 
inevitable increase in retail prices, which, in turn, raised the 
cost of the consumer basket. 
<H5>  THE SOCIAL SPHERE </H5>
  Labor placement and employment of the population. 
In 1993, 54,200 citizens looking for work applied to the 
employment service regarding placement, 89.6 percent of which 
were not engaged in labor activity, 4.1 percent--pensioners, 5.2 
percent--students wanting to work during their free time, and 
1.1 percent--employed population. 
  As of 1 January 1994 there were 17,900 registered as 
unemployed in the oblast, 63.4 percent of whom are receiving 
unemployment compensation. In terms of length of unemployment, 
36.2 percent of the unemployed have not been working for from 
one to four months, and 69.4 percent of them are receiving 
unemployment compensation. 
  During the year 2,900 unemployed citizens received 
occupational training through the employment service, and 1,600 
of them (55.2 percent) were placed in jobs upon completion of 
training. 
  As of the beginning of 1994, 1,066 enterprises reported the 
layoff of 15,300 workers, while 773 enterprises reported a need 
for workers to fill vacancies (vacant positions)--3,800. The 
number of workers laid off exceeded the need for work force 
fourfold. 
  Certain branches of the economy have part-time employment. 
During January-September in industry, construction, 
transportation, scientific institutions, and consumer services 
additional leave on the initiative of the administration was 
assigned to 127,700 workers. As of 1 October 1993 the number of 
people working part time in production was 45,100. 
  The number of workers. During November the average 
registered number of workers in all branches of the economy was 
1,388,200, which is 45,300 less than during the corresponding 
period of last year. 
  Monetary incomes and expenditures of the 
population. In 1993 the monetary circulation under the 
conditions of the further deepening of inflation processes and 
the decline of public production did not improve. According to 
working figures, monetary incomes increased in 1993 by R1.4796 
trillion or 9.2-fold as compared to 1992, and reached R1.6603 
trillion. Consumer expenditures rose by R767.6 or 8.1-fold and 
amounted to R867.4. 
  According to figures from the Central Bank of the Russian 
Federation for Chelyabinsk Oblast, issuance (the transfer of 
monetary funds from reserve to circulating) increased 10.7-fold 
as compared to 1992 and reached R551.7 billion in 1993. During 
the year payments of wages increased 9.3-fold and amounted to 
R836.6 billion, the issuance of incentive payments, monetary and 
other payments--10.5-fold, and stipends--7.2-fold. 
  The average monthly wages during January-September increased 
each month by an average of 20 percent, in October as compared 
to the preceding month--by 17 percent, and in November--by 8.8 
percent. During nine months of last year the growth rate of 
wages was higher than the growth rate of prices and in the 
fourth quarter the growth rate of prices outstripped the growth 
rate of wages. 
  In November the average monthly wages in the economy of 
Chelyabinsk Oblast amounted to R109,865 and wages at 
agricultural enterprises, forestry enterprises, and institutions 
of science and public education were almost 50 percent less. 
  The highest growth rates of average monthly wages in 
November 
as compared to an analogous period of 1992 were in institutions 
of public education--13.1-fold, although the average monthly 
wages were not high--R64,609, and in computer service 
organizations--12.7-fold. 
  The proportion of consumer expenditures in the overall sum 
of 
expenditures decreased from 83.5 percent in 1992 to 78.1 percent 
in 1993. As compared to 1992 there was a considerable increase 
in mandatory payments and voluntary contributions (11.3-fold) 
and an increase in the savings of the population in deposits and 
securities (12-fold) and expenditures of the population on paid 
services (10.3-fold). In terms of average per capita monetary 
income the process of stratification of the population is 
continuing. While in the third quarter of 1993 most of the 
families (71.7 percent) were in 10 groups with incomes from 
R20,000 to R70,000, in the fourth quarter 43.2 percent of the 
families were in these groups. The proportion of families with 
incomes from R70,000 to R100,000 increased from 12.5 to 25.4 
percent, and over R100,000--from 8.2 to 30.2 percent. 
  The consumer goods and services market. The oblast 
produced consumer goods (including alcoholic beverages) valued 
at a total of R636.5 in current prices. As compared to 1992 
their output decreased by R59.7 billion or 8.6 percent. 
  The output of food products decreased by R28.6 billion or 
14.1 percent. Meat production decreased by 11,500 tonnes, 
sausage items--by 5,763 tonnes, semimanufactured meat 
products--by 1,821 tonnes, butter--by 154 tonnes, whole milk 
products--by 4,738 tonnes, canned goods--by 5,344,000 standard 
cans, cereals--by 4,712 tonnes, bread and bakery items--by 
42,900 tonnes, confectionery items--by 1,929 tonnes, macaroni 
items--by 8,713 tonnes, and margarine products--by 10,800 
tonnes. There was an increase in the output of fatty cheeses, 
mayonnaise, and nonalcoholic beverages. The production of 
alcoholic beverages increased by 18.2 percent measured in 
monetary value. The output of vodka and liquor items increased 
by 140,000 decaliters or 2.8 percent. 
  During the past year a total of R367.5 billion worth of 
nonfoodstuffs, including light industry goods, were produced, 
which is 11.1 percent less than during the preceding year. 
  The population of the oblast acquired 19 percent less goods 
(in comparable prices) than in 1992. 
  Education. As of the beginning of the 1993-94 
school year in the oblast there were 11 higher educational 
institutions, one branch of the Moscow Commercial University, 
and 71 secondary specialized educational institutions. 
  In 1993 two tekhnikums were closed. The Magnitogorsk Higher 
Music School was transformed into a music pedagogical institute. 
Among the secondary specialized educational institutions there 
are 15 colleges, nine of which acquired the status of a college 
in 1993. 
  Some 9,000 specialists with higher education and 14,900 with 
secondary specialized qualifications were sent to the branches 
of the oblast economy in 1993. Of the overall number of 
graduates, 32 percent of the VUZ [higher educational 
institution] specialists and 50 percent of the tekhnikum 
graduates were not placed in jobs. The list of unemployed was 
increased by 499 specialists with higher and secondary 
specialized qualifications. 
  The admission of students into VUZ's during the year 
decreased by 100 and amounted to 10,600 students while 
admissions to tekhnikums increased by 300 (18,700 students). The 
competition amounted to 1.7 and 1.6 people per space, 
respectively. 
  During 1993, 54 children's preschool institutions were 
closed. The main reasons for the closure of kindergartens and 
day nurseries were the inadequate number of children, the 
dilapidated conditions of the buildings, and the high parental 
payments. The buildings of the closed preschool institutions 
were made into hotels, residences, dormitories, warehouses, 
offices, and banks. More than 10 percent of these premises are 
empty. 
  Health protection. The number of hospital beds in 
medical institutions as of the end of the year was 48,100, which 
was 134 beds for every 10,000 residents. For every 10,000 
residents of the oblast there is an average of 36 physicians and 
101 people working as intermediate medical personnel. 
<H5>  MATERIAL PRODUCTION </H5>
  Industry. The production volume (in comparable 
prices) decreased by 20.6 percent as compared to the preceding 
year. The tendency toward retardation of the decline of 
production that was observed toward the beginning of last year 
continued until November. During the last two months of the year 
there was a significant reduction of production, in November--by 
24 percent and December--by 26.9 percent. 
  Each month during the year at an average of 35 enterprises 
there were lengthy production shutdowns (in November and 
December at 53 and 63 enterprises, respectively). During the 
year the losses of working time for this reason amounted to 2.5 
million man-days or 12.5 percent of the scheduled working time. 
More than half of the shutdowns of enterprises last year were 
related to difficulties in selling products and about one-third 
to lack of provision of material resources. As a result of the 
lengthy shutdowns of enterprises and productions during the 
year, R65.2 billion worth of products were not produced. 
  Labor productivity in industry decreased by 15.8 percent. 
The 
number of industrial production personnel amounted to 559,000 
and decreased by 32,000 or 5.4 percent. The average monthly 
wages of workers in basic production in industry were R84,800, 
including in December--R146,200. 
  Industrial enterprises of the oblast failed to deliver to 
consumers R134.7 billion worth of products under agreements that 
were concluded. The greatest arrears in product deliveries were 
found in enterprises of the metallurgical complex--97.9 percent 
of all the indebtedness. 
  In the fuel and energy complex with an overall reduction in 
production volume of 2 percent, the output of electric energy 
decreased by 7.8 percent and coal extraction--by 1 percent. 
  The agro-industrial complex. The volume of gross 
agricultural output (in comparable prices) on all categories of 
farms, according to preliminary calculations, decreased by 6.6 
percent during the year. The reduction of volumes occurred 
mainly on public farms. On private subsidiary farms of the 
population the volume of products produced exceeded last year's 
level by 3.6 percent, and on peasant farms--by 1.6-fold. 
  Labor productivity dropped by 8.6 percent and 210 
agricultural enterprises ended the year with a profit, while 65 
ended it with losses. During the year the farms received R15.4 
billion in profit. The profitability level was 14.8 percent. 
  As a result of the reduction of the planted areas and the 
reduction of productivity in 1993 as compared to 1992 there was 
a reduction of the gross yield of grain crops from 2,781,300 
tonnes to 1,817,700 tonnes (65.4 percent), potatoes--from 
634,900 to 503,700 (79.3 percent), and vegetables--from 131,200 
to 111,800 tonnes (85.2 percent). 
  The farms of the oblast stored up 16,500 tonnes of potatoes 
(39.5 percent of the 1992 level) and 36,500 tonnes of vegetables 
(63.1 percent). The annual volumes of mandatory deliveries of 
potatoes were fulfilled by 30.1 percent, of vegetables--by 66.4 
percent. 
  In 1993 there was a certain slowing up of the decline of the 
production of animal husbandry products at agricultural 
enterprises: During the report year they produced (sold for 
slaughter) 128,500 tonnes of cattle and poultry in live weight 
(95.5 percent of the 1992 level), 512,000 tonnes of milk (99.4 
percent), 639 million eggs (94.5 percent), and 1,504 tonnes of 
wool (105.6 percent). 
  On average from one cow the farms of the oblast obtained 165 
kilograms (8.1 percent) of milk more than in 1992. The average 
yield of wool from one sheep increased by 0.7 kilograms (21.9 
percent). The average daily weight gain of cattle being fattened 
increased by 80 grams (24 percent), for hogs it dropped by 35 
grams (11.5 percent), and the egg production of laying hens 
decreased by five eggs (2 percent). 
  The number of head of the main kinds of livestock continues 
to decrease. During last year the number of cattle decreased by 
8.2 percent and amounted to 640,800 head, including cows--by 6.4 
percent (221,500 head). The number of hogs decreased by 12.5 
percent (262,500 head), and sheep--by 12.6 percent (330,600 
head). The number of head of poultry increased by 4.5 percent 
and amounted to 7,772,600. A smaller number of calves and 
piglets were born. The maintenance of the main kinds of 
livestock improved. 
  During the past year state resources have acquired 98,400 
tonnes of cattle and poultry (94.2 percent of the 1992 level), 
416,000 tonnes of milk (99.5 percent), 573.8 million eggs (101 
percent), and 813 tonnes of wool (94.4 percent). The annual 
volumes of mandatory deliveries of cattle and poultry were 
fulfilled by 108.1 percent, milk--by 104 percent, and eggs--by 
140 percent. State procurements of cattle and poultry increased 
in seven rayons and cities of the oblast, and milk--in 12. 
  By 1 January 1994 in the oblast there were 7,022 peasant 
(farmer-run) farms with an overall area of land granted to them 
of 409,600 hectares (an average of 58.3 hectares per farm). The 
re-registration of the sovkhozes and kolkhozes is continuing. 
During the year 259 farms were re-registered, of which only 29 
(11.2 percent) retained their status. 
  The scale of rural construction continued to decrease in 
1993. The volume of capital investments in the development of 
the agro-industrial complex was R72 billion and decreased as 
compared to 1992 by 27 percent. During the year facilities were 
introduced to accommodate 1,050 cattle, 140 hogs, and 400 sheep, 
and 79 kilometers of roads were built. The introduction of 
animal husbandry facilities, silage and haylage structures grain 
storage facilities, and roads decreased three- to fourfold as 
compared to last year. 
  Capital construction. Only one-fourth of all the 
startup facilities and capacities were introduced. Facilities 
were not introduced at plants of the processing branches, nor 
were capacities for producing consumer goods, machine-building 
and metallurgy facilities, or water and air purification 
facilities at many industrial enterprises. The startup of fixed 
capital amounted to R200 billion. 
  During the year R518 billion was invested in the economy. 
This is 20 percent less than in 1992 and almost 50 percent less 
as compared to 1989 or 1990. Expenditures of state enterprises 
and organizations in the overall volume of capital investments 
amounted to R205 billion (40 percent) and R303 billion (58 
percent) came from joint-stock companies and limited liability 
partnerships. Internal capital of enterprises and organizations 
made up 70 percent of the overall volume of capital investments. 
  Enterprises and organizations with all forms of ownership 
assimilated R154 billion in centralized capital investments 
during the year (30 percent of all the funds), including from 
the republic budget--R52 billion and the local budget--R79 
billion. 
  The proportion of capital investments in production 
construction amounted to 58 percent and nonproduction 
construction--42 percent. 
  The process of destatization accelerated in the construction 
complex. The greatest development was in mixed and private forms 
of ownership. Of the overall volume of contracting work 
performed, 57 percent was performed by organizations with the 
mixed form of ownership, 29 percent--by organizations with a 
private form of ownership, and only 14 percent--by state 
organizations. 
  During the year construction organizations with all forms of 
ownership performed contracting work for a total of R350 billion. 
  A total of R216 billion in capital investments or 42 percent 
of the overall volume went for the construction of facilities in 
the social sphere. Almost two-thirds of these funds was used for 
housing construction. Residential buildings with an overall area 
of 980,000 square meters were put into operation. New apartments 
were assigned to 16,600 families. 
  As compared to 1992 the startup of housing decreased by 15 
percent and as compared to the average annual startup during the 
period of 1986-1990--by 40 percent. The scale of housing 
construction in the oblast dropped to the level of the beginning 
of the 1950's. 
  Funds belonging to the population of the oblast were used 
for 
the introduction of 66,000 square meters of residential space, 
or 7 percent of the overall amount introduced. Of this area 
26,000 square meters were constructed by housing construction 
cooperatives and 502 buildings with 40,000 square meters--by 
individual builders. For military servicemen in the oblast, 529 
new apartments with 29,000 square meters were introduced. For 
rural residents, 152,000 square meters of dwelling space was 
introduced, which was 31,000 less than during the previous year. 
  The following were introduced in the oblast during the year: 
20 general educational schools to accommodate 9,836 children, 10 
preschool institutions to accommodate 1,370, and 4 polyclinics 
capable of handling 590 visits [per shift], 36.7 km of running 
water lines, 6.6 km of sewage lines, 186.4 km of gas lines, and 
20 km of heating networks. Of these, the following were 
introduced in rural areas: 20 schools to accommodate 2,340 
children, 5 preschool institutions to accommodate 470, and 2 
polyclinics capable of handling 140 visits, 26.5 km of running 
water lines, 170 km of gas lines, and 15.5 km of heating 
networks. 
  A total of R16 billion was used for measures to clean up 
after radioactive pollution in the oblast. These funds were used 
to introduce for the population of the regions that suffered 
from this residential buildings with an overall area of 42,000 
square meters, schools to accommodate 120 children, a 
kindergarten to accommodate 140, and a polyclinic capable of 
handling 100 visits. 
  In 1993, R4.2 billion in capital investments was used for 
building the Chelyabinsk subway and construction and 
installation work valued at a total of R2.5 billion was 
performed. 
  Transportation and communications. The volumes of 
freight shipments decreased on all kinds of transportation. In 
1993 as compared to 1992 shipment of freight by rail 
transportation decreased by 20 percent, and by automotive and 
air transportation, by 47 and 45 percent, respectively. 
  Most of the passenger transportation was conducted by 
municipal automotive transportation enterprises. In 1993 buses 
transported 508 million passengers, or 90 percent of the number 
in 1992. 
  Transportation service for the population is not improving. 
During 1993 in Chelyabinsk alone up to 12 percent of the bus 
trips on city routes and 6 percent of the trolley trips were not 
made. 
  On rail transportation during the year 735 passenger trains 
(3.3 percent) arrived late and the average time of delay was 1.6 
hours. On domestic airlines the arrival time of every fourth 
flight into the Chelyabinsk airport was in violation of the 
schedule. 
  During 1993 communications enterprises rendered the national 
economy and the population services in a volume of R27 billion, 
which is more than 10 times more than last year. The rates for 
communications services increased 10.8-fold as compared to 1992. 
  There was a considerable reduction of the delivery of 
newspapers and magazines--by 52.7 percent, letters, cards, and 
printed material--34.2 percent, and money transfers--39.1 
percent. More than 4 percent of letters arrive late. Postal 
dispatches are lost and stolen. During 1993, 35 cases of loss 
and theft valued at R25,300 were registered. 
  The quality of the work of telephone communications remains 
poor. 
<H5>  FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS </H5>
  During the year R487 billion worth of products were 
delivered 
for export, of which R211 billion (43 percent) were delivered 
for freely convertible currency. 
  The greatest volume of exports was from ferrous metallurgy 
enterprises--76 percent or R369 billion, and machine 
building--11.5 percent or R56 billion. 
  The proportion of exports of raw and processed materials was 
91.8 percent, and machines and equipment--3.9 percent. We 
exported 4.1 million tonnes of ferrous metals, 5,276 tonnes of 
nickel, 10,000 tonnes of zinc, 421 bulldozers, 962 motor 
vehicles, and other products. 
  Enterprise accounts received from exporting products and 
services $392 million or 92 percent of the overall foreign 
currency revenues.

<F P=106> [Report by Khabarovsk Kray Statistical Administration: "The </F>
Socioeconomic Situation of Khabarovsk Kray in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993 we did not succeed in halting the decline of 
production volumes in industry, agriculture, and capital 
construction. The volume of industrial production dropped by 22 
percent, agriculture--by 9 percent, and the volume of 
investments--by 26 percent. 
  As of 1 December 18.7 percent of the enterprises and 
organizations of the kray were operating at a loss. 
  The socioeconomic situation of Khabarovsk Kray in 1993 is 
characterized by the following basic indicators:

<H5>  FINANCES </H5>
  As of 1 December the national economy had received about 370 
billion rubles [R] in profit. Industry accounted for 54 percent 
of all the profit received. The proportion of enterprises 
operating at a loss remains high. In industry 15 percent of the 
enterprises are operating at a loss, in construction--6 percent, 
in housing and municipal services--41 percent, and in consumer 
services--47 percent. 
  The financial position of the enterprises is complicated by 
the deepening nonpayments crisis. Among the enterprises and 
organizations of industry, construction, transportation, and 
agriculture that were studied, as of 1 December 1993 defaulted 
indebtedness to suppliers amounted to R135.8 billion and had 
increased by 29 percent as compared to the preceding month. At 
the same time the volume of defaulted indebtedness of buyers and 
clients to these enterprises amounted to R237 billion or 54 
percent of the overall indebtedness of buyers, including to 
industrial enterprises--R193 billion. 
<H5>  PRIVATIZATION </H5>
  As of 1 January 1994, 939 enterprises had been privatized in 
the kray, including 618 during 1993, which is twice as many as 
in 1992. In the structure of privatized enterprises there is a 
predominance of enterprises of trade (30 percent of the overall 
number), industry (23 percent), and consumer services (24 
percent). 
  During 1993, 165 enterprises were privatized through the 
creation of joint-stock companies. 
  Of the three versions of benefits offered to the labor 
collectives, preference is given to the second, which allows 
them to own a controlling block of shares (81 percent). 
  "Small-scale" privatization is carried out mainly through 
sale in commercial competition (54 percent of the overall number 
privatized), at auctions (10 percent), and through the purchase 
of leased property (7 percent). 
  The overall earnings from privatization during 1993 amounted 
to R13.6 billion and 619,700 privatization checks. 
  The process of privatization of housing continued in the 
kray 
last year. During 1993, 74,800 apartments were sold for private 
ownership of citizens, which is three times more than during 
1992. 
  The average size of privatized apartments was 50.3 square 
meters. The largest numbers of apartments turned over for 
private ownership of citizens were in Khabarovsk--23,465 and 
Komsomolsk--18,942, and the following rayons: Amurskiy--7,847, 
Sovetsko-Gavanskiy--4,403, and imeni S. Lazo--2,925. 
<H5>  LEVEL AND INDICES OF PRICES AND RATES </H5>
  The high growth rate of prices continued in 1993. 
  The growth of wholesale prices in industry and procurement 
prices in the agro-industrial complex had an impact on the 
growth of consumer prices. In December 1993 as compared to 
December 1992 the consumer price index (inflation index) was 
1,123.3 percent. Prices of foodstuffs increased 11.3-fold after 
the beginning of the year. The highest rates of increase in 
prices were noted during July-August (July--39 percent, 
August--37 percent). In December the growth of food prices 
slowed up and amounted to 12.8 percent of those of the preceding 
month. 
  Since the beginning of the year there has been more than a 
14-fold increase in the cost of beef, mutton, sausage items, 
bread and bakery items, caramel, fresh cabbage, mineral water, 
and ice cream; 10-12-fold increase in pork, poultry meat, 
salami, macaroni items, cheeses, eggs, mayonnaise, semolina, and 
beer; seven- to ninefold increase in vegetable oil, flour, 
margarine, pastries, spices, frozen fish, onions, and carrots; 
sixfold increase in sugar, fats, rice, cocoa, chocolate, and 
honey; and four- to fivefold in butter, cottage cheese, 
buckwheat, peas, tea, instant coffee, starch, canned vegetable 
baby food, and beets. The price of potatoes went up 
considerably--43-fold. 
  At city markets in December beef cost 1.5 times more than in 
city trade, milk--three times more, sour cream--4.5 times more, 
and curds--1.4 times more. 
  Prices of nonfoodstuffs rose 10.8-fold compared to December 
1992. Thus fur and fur items increased in cost 18-fold; silk 
fabrics--13.5-fold; cotton fabrics, women's and children's 
clothing, children's footwear, furniture, and construction 
materials--10-12-fold; outer knitwear, hosiery items, and men's 
footwear--ninefold; women's footwear, perfume, haberdashery, 
watches, jewelry items, and printed publications--seven- to 
eightfold; electrical goods, radio goods, and rugs--four- to 
sixfold. 
  Prices and rates for paid services rendered to the 
population 
increased 22.9-fold, which is twice the growth rate of prices of 
consumer goods. For example, laundry services were 46 times more 
expensive, bath services--32 times, mending of sewn items and 
television sets and photography services--26-27 times, barber 
and religious services--24 times, and custom tailoring of sewn 
items and dry cleaning services--17 times. The greatest cost 
increases were for long-distance telephone calls--113-fold, 
housing and municipal services--119-fold, and services of a 
legal nature and of banking institutions--356-fold. 
  Wholesale prices of industrial products produced by 
enterprises of the kray had increased 10.4-fold in December 1993 
as compared to December 1992, including by 3.8 percent during 
December. 
  There were significant price increases in branch of lifting 
and transport machine-building--12.4-fold and in diesel 
construction--11.5-fold. The cost of producing construction 
materials increased ninefold, electric energy--sevenfold, and 
machine tool building--7.6-fold. 
  Prices for the production of consumer goods continued to 
increase. In the timber and sewing industry they increased 
15.5-fold, and leather haberdashery--11-fold. In the food 
industry the greatest rates of growth of wholesale prices were 
found in: the dairy industry--15.3-fold, meat--13.3-fold, 
confectionery--12.4-fold, wine making--12.1-fold, and bread 
baking--10.9-fold. 
  The growth of rates for freight transportation were 18.7 
times greater in December 1993 than in December 1992. The 
largest increase during the year was in the rates for rail 
transportation--22.5-fold, and automotive and air 
transportation--9.2-fold. 
<H5>  THE SOCIAL SPHERE </H5>
  THE DEMOGRAPHIC SITUATION. As before in the kray the birth 
rate is dropping while the death rate is simultaneously 
increasing, which does not provide even for simple reproduction 
of the population. 
  According to preliminary figures, as of 1 January 1994 the 
population of the kray was 1,607,200, which is almost 1 percent 
or 13,800 less than last year. 
  The number of births during 1993 was 15,500, and 
deaths--about 20,000. Thus natural population loss amounted to 
4,500. 
  The number of births per 1,000 population dropped by 
approximately 12 percent compared to the preceding year and 
amounted to 9.6, while the number of deaths by the same count 
increased by 18 percent and amounted to 12.3. 
  The main causes of death among the population continue to be 
cardiovascular diseases (51 percent of all deaths), accidents 
and poisoning (23 percent), and tumors (14 percent). It should 
be noted that the death rate from tuberculosis among the 
population in the kray is rising. As compared to 1992 the number 
of deaths from this cause increased by 30 percent and is now 250. 
  The death rate of children under one year of age is 
increasing. In 1993, 19 out of every 1,000 newborns died, and in 
1992 this figure was 16. 
  In 1993, 11,724 marriages were registered and 9,130 divorces 
were filed. As compared to 1992 the number of marriages 
decreased by 0.2 percent and the number of divorces increased by 
1 percent. 
  There is an outflow of population outside the kray. In 1993, 
28,467 people came to the kray and 38,068 left, and the 
migration balance was minus 9,601. 
  LABOR RESOURCES. The overall number of people employed in 
the 
kray's economy in 1993 was 584,700, decreasing by 5 percent as 
compared to last year. There was a considerable reduction of the 
number of people working in planning and scientific 
organizations, industry, and construction as compared to last 
year. There was an increase in the number of people employed in 
administrative organs, public education, and financial 
institutions. 
  During the period since the beginning of the year 15,000 
people have been discharged because of layoffs. About 8,400 
people are working part-time and are potentially unemployed. 
Partial unemployment affected 32,200 people, including from 
industry--19,300 (60 percent), construction--8,900 (27.6 
percent), and transportation--3,700 (11.4 percent). The overall 
number of leaves initiated by the administration amounted 
764,100 man-days. 
  The overall number of people without work who were actively 
seeking it at the end of 1993 was 24,900 or 3.4 percent of the 
economically active population. At the present time 5,794 people 
or 0.8 percent of the economically active population have the 
official status of unemployed, and during the year their number 
almost doubled. The majority of those registered as unemployed 
are women. As of the end of the year there were 4,685 of them, 
or 81 percent. Youth under 30 years of age make up almost 34 
percent of the unemployed. The average length of unemployment in 
1993 was four months, but for 246 people (4 percent) the period 
of unemployment exceeded 12 months. Unemployment compensation is 
being received by 3,615 people (62 percent). 
  The local employment services and the kray employment center 
are working to render aid to the unemployed population and 
laid-off workers in acquiring job skills or changing their 
qualifications, taking into account the change in demand on the 
labor market. 
  In 1993, 1,335 people were sent for occupational training, 
including 871 under 30 years of age. Occupational training was 
given to 684 people, of whom 23 percent were in training for the 
first time and 76 percent were going through retraining. Of 
those who went through occupational training, only 494 or 72 
percent found jobs. 
  INCOMES OF THE POPULATION. Monetary incomes of the 
population 
during 1993 amounted to R1,100 billion and as compared to 1992 
increased 10-fold in nominal value. Of the overall sum of 
monetary income, the population spent about R600 billion on 
goods and services, which is 10 times more than last year; the 
population paid taxes, various fees, and other kinds of outlays 
for a total of R180 billion, and R50 billion was deposited into 
accounts for investments and used to acquire securities. 
  The average monthly earnings of workers employed in the 
kray's in 1993 amounted to R95,700 and had increased 11-fold as 
compared to the same period of last year. In December the 
average earnings of workers amounted to R234,900 and increased 
by 34 percent as compared to the preceding month. 
  In spite of the measures taken to increase wages of workers 
in budget-financed organizations, labor compensation for workers 
in public health, public education, science and scientific 
service, culture and art is almost 60 percent lower than labor 
compensation for workers employed in the sphere of material 
production. 
  In 1993 the best paid were workers of banks and insurance 
companies (R265,800) and air and rail transportation (R157,300 
and R135,700, respectively). Last year the least was received by 
workers of science and scientific service (R58,600) and art 
(R57,600). 
  Payments of a social nature (material aid, etc.) on average 
per worker in December amounted to R18,800 and had increased 
38-fold as compared to the beginning of the year. Taking these 
payments into account, the income of one worker in December 
amounted to R253,700. 
  THE CONSUMER GOODS AND SERVICES MARKET. The production of 
consumer goods decreased by almost 10 percent. The output of the 
main kinds of food products is characterized by the following 
figures: 


                                 Actually produced        1993 in % of 1992 

Meat, including subproducts of   15,283                   81.5 
category I, tonnes 

Sausage items, tonnes            13,355                   87 

Semimanufactured meat            1,970                    93 
products, tonnes 

Whole milk products, tonnes      65,106                   77 

Canned fish, thousands of        9,695                    133 
standard cans 

Canned fruits and vegetables,    4,088                    86 
thousands of standard cans 

Flour, tonnes                    170,672                  78 

Cereals, tonnes                  22,622                   68 

Bread and bakery items, tonnes   140,555                  91.5 


Confectionery items, tonnes      29,860                   98 

Macaroni items, tonnes           9,131                    76 

Margarine products, tonnes       11,094                   56 


  The production of alcoholic beverages decreased by 9 
percent. 
  The situation is not the best in branches that produce light 
industry products. The shortage of their own circulating capital 
caused by difficulties with selling products and nonpayments by 
the customers make up one of the main factors involved in the 
reduction of production volumes. The annual commodity turnover 
in public catering in the kray in 1993 came to R463 billion. In 
the mass of commodities the population received 14 percent less 
than in 1992. 
  The nonstate sector is beginning to play an ever greater 
role 
in it. The share of the private sector in commodity turnover 
increased from 4 percent in 1992 to 16 percent according to the 
results of 1993. 
  In the structure of commodity turnover there was some 
increase in the proportion of nonfoodstuffs, which reached 38 
percent as against 36 percent a year ago. 
  The satisfaction of the needs of trade for certain kinds of 
goods is gradually improving. The supply of bread, flour, 
cereals, and dairy products is basically proceeding normally. At 
the same time the assortment and quality of the products and 
their prices do not always meet consumer demand. Items made of 
natural fur, coats, suits, television sets, and other goods for 
cultural and personal purposes and household use are always for 
sale. But the market is being filled to a considerable degree by 
deliveries from abroad. 
  The volume of sales of paid services during 1993 amounted to 
a total of R82 billion, which is about 50 percent in comparable 
prices for 1992. 
  EDUCATION. During the past school year there were 507 day 
general educational schools in operation in the kray (234,000 
students), of which 129 were schools with in-depth study of 
various subjects (18,900); their number almost doubled, and 
there are 11 gymnasiums (8,100) and nine lyceums (2,100) in 
operation. 
  There is one nonstate school in operation (59 students). 
  In regions where people of the North reside there are 4,100 
children of small ethnic groups of the North attending 131 
schools. 
  As in previous years, every third student attends the second 
shift but, additionally, the kray has 10 schools that operate on 
three shifts. The technical condition of the schools undoubtedly 
has an impact on the quality of the education. In the kray there 
are 157 schools (31 percent of the overall number) accommodating 
a total of 57,200 which are in need of capital repair, and 40 
schools (7.8 percent) accommodating 13,900 which are in 
dilapidated condition. 
  In 1993 in the VUZ's [higher educational institutions] and 
secondary specialized educational institutions of the kray, 
6,300 and 6,100 specialists were trained, respectively. Many 
graduates of day divisions experienced difficulties in finding 
employment since only half of them had been placed in jobs. 
  CONDITION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. The condition of the 
environment has a very great influence on human health. The 
ecological situation in the kray remained grim last year. There 
were 34 cases of flooding, and other overflows and discharges of 
pollutants were revealed, the total damage from which was R130 
million (of which 95 million--73 percent--was damage to land 
resources). 
  Ecological violations constituted grounds for bringing 
administrative charges against 564 people and criminal charges 
against three. The total fines collected amounted to R58 
million. The production activity of eight facilities was halted 
because of violation of the requirements of environmental 
protection legislation. 
  Capital investments totaling R6.5 billion were used for 
measures for protection of the environment and efficient use of 
natural resources. 
  LEGAL VIOLATIONS. During 1993 internal affairs organs in the 
kray registered 47,600 crimes, which was 2.7 percent more than 
in 1992. Almost one-sixth of the crimes were heinous. 
  There were 454 murders or murder attempts (11.8 percent 
more). 
  Public places were the scene of 12,200 crimes, including 
7,200 on the streets, the increase amounting to 3.3 percent and 
9.6 percent, respectively. 
  The number of crimes committed in an intoxicated condition 
increased by 23.9 percent, with a total of 8,693 of them. 
  The number of crimes involving theft of private property 
decreased by 5.2 percent, including from apartments--by 3.2 
percent. 
  There were 258 cases of grand larceny. 
  About 4,000 group crimes were registered (an increase of 7.3 
percent). 
  A total of 23,600 people were arrested for crimes. 
  The greatest rise in crime was observed in 
Ayano-Mayskiy--60.6 percent, Vikinskiy--27.5 percent, imeni S. 
Lazo--27 percent, and Verkhneburennskiy--19.4 percent--rayons in 
the kray. 
<H5>  MATERIAL PRODUCTION </H5>
  INDUSTRY. The volume of industrial production decreased by 
22 
percent in 1993, including in December--by 40 percent. 
  In branches operating in the consumer market the reduction 
of 
the output of products in December amounted to 14 percent, and 
in those that produce products for production and technical 
purposes--43 percent. 
  Each month certain productions are suspended at 30-40 
enterprises of the kray, resulting in a loss of working time 
during the year of 948,700 man-days, 54 percent of which were 
losses related to difficulties with selling the products and 41 
percent because of the lack of raw and processed materials. 
  In electric energy engineering the production volume 
decreased by 4.5 percent in 1993, and in the fuel industry--by 
27 percent. The amounts of coal extracted and gasoline produced 
were 22 percent less than in 1992. 
  Enterprises of the metallurgical industry extracted 2 
percent 
more gold than in 1992. They smelted 12 percent less steel and 
34 percent less rolled metal was produced. 
  In machine building there was a sharp drop in production in 
December, and during the year as a whole the output of products 
decreased by 27 percent. There was a considerable decrease in 
output by enterprises of the shipbuilding industry, the Daldizel 
Plant, the plant for lifting and transport equipment, the Splav 
and Amurlitmash plants, the machine tool building plant, and 
Dalenergomash. 
  Enterprises of the timber, wood-processing, and pulp and 
paper industry reduced their production volume by 24 percent, 
including commercial timber--27 percent, lumber and plywood--40 
percent, chipboard, fiberboard, and pulp--44 percent, and 
composition board--5 percent. 
  In the construction materials industry the output of brick 
decreased by 13 percent, prefabricated reinforced concrete 
elements--by 22 percent, and soft roofing materials--by 65 
percent. 
  THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. According to preliminary 
figures 
the volume of gross agricultural output was R290.7 million, 
including crop growing products--R110.4 million. As compared to 
1992 the volume of gross output decreased by R28.4 million (9 
percent). 
  Labor productivity in public agriculture decreased by 8 
percent. 
  The number of farms operating at a loss increased from 35 in 
1992 to 43 in 1993. Losses in agricultural production amounted 
to 16.2 percent as against 2.8 percent in 1992. 
  As compared to 1992 grain production increased by 23 
percent, 
potatoes--19 percent, soy beans--67 percent, and vegetables 
decreased by 22 percent. 
  The plan for procurements of all kinds of feeds was not 
fulfilled. On the kolkhozes and state agricultural enterprises 
for every one conventional head of cattle they prepared 15.5 
quintals of feed units as against 15.8 in 1992. 
  Less was procured of the following: potatoes--by 1 percent, 
vegetables--by 27 percent, and fruits and berries--by 19 percent. 
  All categories of farms sold 50,900 tonnes of cattle and 
poultry in live weight for slaughter (less than in 1992 by 12 
percent), they produced 105,000 tonnes less milk (5 percent) and 
362.4 million fewer eggs (18 percent). 
  The average milk yield per cow on the kolkhozes, sovkhozes, 
and state agricultural enterprises was 2,104 kilograms, and the 
egg production per laying hen was 217 eggs (increases of 5 
percent and 7 percent, respectively). 
  According to data from the livestock count, as of 1 January 
1994 on all categories of farms there were 107,300 head of 
cattle, including 45,200 cows, 268,500 hogs, 6,500 sheep and 
goats, and 500,830,000 head of poultry. As compared to 1992 the 
number of cattle decreased by 5,800 head, including cows--by 
2,800 head, hogs--by 43,800, and poultry--by 279,100, and the 
number of sheep and goats increased by 400 head. 
  The reduction of the number of head of livestock occurred as 
a result of their reduction at agricultural enterprises. 
  On farms belonging to the population the number of head of 
cattle increased by 4 percent, including cows--by 6 percent, and 
the number of hogs decreased by 16 percent. 
  For purposes of the development of subsidiary farms, 
agricultural enterprises of the kray sold the population 10,100 
head (24 percent less than in 1992) and 634,000 head of poultry 
(39 percent). 
  On all categories of farms 30,000 tonnes of cattle and 
poultry (in live weight) were purchased along with 54,200 tonnes 
of milk, which were 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively, more 
than last year. The quantity of eggs purchased was 12.4 million 
or 5 percent more. 
  As of 1 January 1994 in the kray there were 1,818 peasant 
(farmer-run) farms. They were granted 45,000 hectares of land 
(an average of 25 hectares per farm). 
  Since January 1992, 184 peasant farms have terminated their 
activity, 68 of the farms being located in the rayon imeni Lazo, 
19--in Khabarovskiy, and 15--in Ulchskiy. 
  In 1993, 1,400 hectares of land were allotted to 7,900 
families for collective orchards and 1,900 were allotted to 
55,200 families for kitchen gardens. 
  CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION. In 1993 enterprises and organizations 
with all forms of ownership utilized R263.5 billion in capital 
investments. As compared to the preceding year the volume of 
investments decreased by 26 percent. Facilities for production 
purposes utilized R132.1 (37 percent less). 
  Of the overall volume of capital investments, expenditures 
of 
state enterprises and organizations amounted to R171 billion (65 
percent), 67.5 billion of which was their own; leasing 
enterprises spent R7.7 billion, joint-stock companies--R78.5 
billion (30 percent), kolkhozes--R1.3 billion (0.5 percent), and 
individual builders--0.2 billion (0.1 percent). 
  Centralized capital investments made up half of the overall 
volume, including from the republic budget--R88 billion, and 
local budgets--R43.6 billion. 
  Additionally, R7.8 billion in state investment credit was 
assimilated for the implementation of federal target programs 
and the Konversiya program. 
  Fixed capital valued at R73.8 was put into operation. The 
following production capacities wee released to go online during 
the year: at the Amur shipbuilding plant, a complex of 
facilities for furniture production, and at the plant for 
lifting and transport equipment--capacities for manufacturing 50 
elevators; the airport in Khabarovsk was expanded to serve 1,500 
passengers an hour. 
  In 1993, 7,504 well-designed new apartments with an overall 
area of 431,300 square meters were built, which is 5 percent 
more than during the preceding year. 
  State enterprises and organizations put into operation 65 
percent of the overall volume of housing, the population at its 
own expense and with the help of state financing--2.6 percent, 
and housing construction collectives--3.7 percent. 
  Among the facilities of the social sphere, five general 
educational schools to accommodate 2,530 were put into operation 
in Sovetsko-Gavanskiy, Verkhneburennskiy, and Ulchskiy Rayons, 
one kindergarten to accommodate 140 in Novyy Urgal, a polyclinic 
for 173 visits per shift in Sovetskaya Gavan, and a club to 
accommodate 150 in Nizhniy Khalby in Komsomolskiy Rayon. 
  In branches of the agro-industrial complex R26.5 million in 
capital investments from all sources of financing were 
assimilated, or 37 percent less than in 1992, including from the 
republic budget--R8.7 billion (2.3 times less). 
  Construction organizations with all forms of ownership 
operating on the territory of the kray performed contracting 
work valued at R227.6 billion, which is 23 percent less than in 
1992. 
  TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS. Under the conditions of 
the further reduction of production volumes and the higher rates 
for all kinds of general purpose transportation in 1993, 
31,639,000 of freight was shipped, which is 32 percent less than 
in 1992. 
  The shipment of freight by rail decreased by 20 percent, 
air--by 26 percent, automotive transportation--34 percent, and 
river--47 percent. 
  In rail transportation in the kray the loading of almost all 
the most important kinds of freight decreased as compared to 
last year, including oil--by 10 percent, cement--by 64 percent, 
grain crops--by 48 percent, and fertilizers--by 81 percent. 
  A total of 7,390,800 tones of national economic freight was 
shipped by coastal sea transportation, which was 11 percent less 
than during 1992. 
  Left in the port of Vanino was 10,700 tonnes of residual 
cargo intended for shipment to regions of the Far North. As of 
the beginning of the navigation period only 150,700 tonnes of 
freight had been shipped to regions of the Far North by the 
transportation and port fleets from the seaports of Vanino and 
Nikolayevsk-na-Amur. 
  Passenger traffic on all kinds of transportation decreased 
by 
5.6 percent and amounted to 251.1 million individuals. The 
greatest reduction of the number of passengers transported was 
on river transportation--(20.3 percent). 
  A total of R13.685 billion was spent on repair and 
maintenance of roads and highway facilities. Repair was 
completed on 460.3 km of roads (64.4 km more than in 1992). 
  But in physical terms the volume of the most important kinds 
of communications services decreased as compared to 1992: the 
dispatch of parcels--by 18 percent, money transfers--by 33 
percent, telegrams--by 36 percent, and long-distance telephone 
calls--by 13 percent. At the same time the sending of letters, 
cards, and printed matter in wrappers, both ordinary and on 
order, increased by 11 percent. 
<H5>  FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS </H5>
  In 1993 the volume of exports amounted to $516 million. More 
than 45 percent of the products exported were timber and items 
made from it (more than 85 percent of its sales were to Japan) 
and ferrous metals and items made from them amounted to $118.4 
million (23 percent) with 82 percent sold in China. More than 10 
percent of the petroleum products were exported ($53 million) 
and about one-fourth of this volume was delivered to Japan. 
  Additionally, more than 21,000 tonnes of nonferrous metals 
and scraps, ground transportation equipment, fish products, and 
other goods were shipped. Raw and processed materials continue 
to dominate exports. 
  The geography of deliveries is expanding: In addition to 
exports to Japan (54.6 percent of the entire volume exported), 
there has been an increase in deliveries to China (32 percent), 
Singapore (4.4 percent), the Republic of Korea (4 percent), Hong 
Kong, Canada, Switzerland, and other countries of Europe and the 
Asiatic region. 
  According to working figures, during the year product 
imports 
amounted to more than $349 million. The greatest quantities of 
imports are from China (64.2 percent of the total imports), 
Japan (12.3 percent), the Republic of Korea (8.3 percent), the 
United States (3.8 percent), and Germany (2.1 percent). There 
were also deliveries from many other various countries: Austria, 
Israel, Italy, Bulgaria, and Finland. The overall imports came 
from 44 countries. The structure of imports was made up mainly 
of foodstuffs and consumer goods (95 percent of all imports). 
  During the past year more than $732 million went into 
foreign 
currency accounts, which exceeds the figures for 1992 more than 
fivefold. 
  More than 62 percent comes from foreign currency revenues 
for 
exported products and 4.7 percent for exported services. The 
outlay amounted to $714.2 million. About 41 percent of the 
foreign currency outlays were various payments; $144 million 
(20.2 percent) was spent on purchasing imported products; the 
sale of foreign currency through authorized banks made up about 
19 percent; and other sales accounted for 15 percent ($107 
million). 
  More than $15 million in foreign investments came to the 
kray 
during 1993, 13.5 million of which went for direct investments; 
77.1 percent of the direct investments were for equipment and 
technologies included in the authorized capital of joint 
ventures, 15.2 percent for targeted monetary deposits; 29 
percent of the foreign investments were in the timber and wood 
processing branch, and 23 percent in the transportation and 
communications branch. 
  More than 47,000 foreign citizens visited the kray for 
various reasons, with 50 percent of the visits being for work 
purposes, 28.5 percent for tourism, and 21 percent of the 
citizens visited the kray on private business. The largest 
percentage of visitors were guests from China (52.1 percent), 
from Japan (21.9 percent), from the United States (12.1 percent) 
and from the Republic of Korea (6.2 percent).

<F P=106> [Article by Fedor Ustyugov and Vitaliy Tuzyuk: "Clash of New </F>
Wave Businessmen With Former Party Nomenklatura Threatens 
Nakhodka With Loss of Free Economic Zone Status"] 
  [Text] We have at our disposal two interesting documents. 
They are accompanied by no less interesting events which have a 
direct influence on the fate of each of the residents of the 
free economic zone "Nakhodka." 
  We will begin, perhaps, with the second of these--the 
official statement adopted by a group of businessmen, 
politicians and jurists of Nakhodka. Among those signing it are 
people who are rather well known in the city: Sergey Bondarev, 
Oleg Oksuzyan, Sergey Diltayev, Gennadiy Zuyev, Igor Sirotinin, 
Sergey Romanchenko, Raisa Govorukha, Valentin Zavadnikov, Viktor 
Pokotilov and others. This statement is a reaction to the 
actions of the city administration, and primarily Mayor Viktor 
Gnezdilov, in regard to the free economic zone. The most 
important and perhaps the most frightening is the fact that, as 
a result of these actions the FEZ [free economic zone] 
"Nakhodka" is becoming, in the opinion of those signing the 
statement, an unfavorable place for enterprise. And the very 
project of the FEZ may turn out to be a complete fiasco. 
  In essence, all this is the result of opposition of the two 
primary political forces in the city. One of them is represented 
by the managers of most of the city's major enterprises, who 
have made their careers within the command-administrative system 
and who are trying to hold on to their positions at any cost. 
The other is comprised of self-made individuals, people who 
represent the entrepreneurial milieu. Both occupy an important 
place in the structure of the FEZ. But, unfortunately, they have 
still not found a common language. Nevertheless, certain goals 
have been achieved. Government decree No. 540 regarding the FEZ 
"Nakhodka" has largely lost its effectiveness, especially in 
regard to customs and tax benefits. 
  The actions of Viktor Gnezdilov may have a much more 
lamentable effect for the territory. In the opinion of the 
financial director of the FEZ administrative committee, Valentin 
Zavadnikov, as a result of the aggressive exercises of the 
mayor, the zone will never even see the new tax credit for 1994. 
And this means a loss of over 100 billion rubles (R), a 
considerable portion of which would have been handed over on a 
non-compensatory basis to the city administration for social, 
cultural and domestic needs. 
  There is another piece of joyless information for the 
stockholders of Nakhodka enterprises. In the opinion of the 
director of the Nakhodka Financial Joint-Stock Company, Gennadiy 
Zuyev, the result of the perturbations which are taking place 
will be a sharp and significant decline in the exchange rate of 
stocks in local AO [joint-stock companies]. The decline in 
business activity on the territory of the FEZ not only by 
domestic, but also by foreign businessmen is entirely 
predictable. 
  The situation underlying the events is rather primitive--a 
banal struggle for power. For this V. Gnezdilov needs to 
maximally weaken the positions of the FEZ administrative 
committee and place his own people in key positions. And that is 
what is going on now. 
  Why did the heads of administration of Nakhodka and 
Partizanskiy Rayon adopt a decree on the de facto elimination of 
independence of the administrative committee, giving it the 
status of a department under the city administration? This 
contradicts the government decree, according to which the 
administrative committee is subordinate to the government of 
Russia. 
  Making use of the fact that former administrative committee 
chairman Igor Ustinov became a deputy in the State Duma and left 
to work in Moscow, V. Gnezdilov decided to arbitrarily replace 
the head of the committee. The general director of the TOO 
[Limited Liability Partnership] "Nakhodkagrazhdanstroy," Sergey 
Dudnik, was named to this position. We might add that this 
decision was made in spite of the opinion of the city 
administration board of directors, as well as of the 
entrepreneurial circles. We will add that if we consult the 
opinion of residents of the Northern Microrayon of Nakhodka 
regarding this candidacy, they would have a few unflattering 
things to say about Sergey Aleksandrovich. And, a fact which is 
of principle importance is that here too the procedure specified 
in government documents was violated. According to these 
documents, the agencies of local self-government only recommend 
candidacies for the position of administrative committee 
chairman, and the government makes the decision regarding the 
appointment. In fact, according to Igor Ustinov's last 
directive, Aleksandr Kotikov is to perform the duties of 
chairman until the lawful appointment of a new chairman. In 
other words, we may speak of violation of the law. 
  Since that is the case, the authors of the statement intend 
to insist on the restoration of legality, the appointment of 
chairman of the FEZ Administrative Committee with involvement of 
all interested parties. Otherwise, they will demand the 
resignation of the mayor. 
  But for now, on the threshold of the March elections, the 
mayor is in a hurry to place the necessary people in the 
necessary positions. And his desire to retain his seat stands 
above the idea of a free economic zone, whose forefather Viktor 
Semenovich considers himself to be. We are afraid that as a 
result of the palace intrigues, the city's residents will lose 
their prospects for improving their standard of living, as well 
as new jobs and many other things that the FEZ can give them, 
yet an ordinary provincial city, of which there are hundreds in 
Russia, can never give them.

<F P=106> [Article by E. Kiryanova: "New Chairman of the FEZ </F>
"Nakhodka" Administrative Committee Appointed in Full 
Correspondence With Standard Documents..."] 
  [Text] In the two preceding issues of KRASNOYE ZNAMYA 
we published the opinion of a group of businessmen, politicians 
and jurists of Nakhodka, who place all their hopes on the 
development of the free economic zone "Nakhodka." They have seen 
in the actions of the city's head of administration, Viktor 
Gnezdilov, a threat to the continued existence of the FEZ [free 
economic zone], following his appointment of S. Dudnik as 
chairman of the FEZ administrative committee. 
  Today we are giving the floor to the Nakhodka city 
administration, which presents an opposing viewpoint. 
  Not only the city, but also the kray has been flooded with 
information from the "lover of truth" and the "fighter" for 
democracy, the newspaper NAKHODKINSKIY PROSPEKT, regarding the 
supposedly impending total fiasco of the free economic zone, the 
"palace overthrows" and the "lost opportunities." Nakhodka 
residents, before whose very eyes and through whose efforts this 
very FEZ was born and developed, overcoming barriers of various 
height, were simply stunned by the fabrications of the newly 
proclaimed "chroniclers." 
  Somewhere beyond the boundaries of Nakhodka, uninformed 
people may believe that the appointment of the new 
administrative committee chairman, S. Dudnik, to replace I. 
Ustinov who had been elected as deputy to the State Duma, will 
make Nakhodka a place which is "unfavorable for enterprise," 
will entail a significant increase in the exchange rate of stock 
in local joint-stock companies, and will influence the 
government, which will not issue credits to Dudnik. 
  In any case, the perplexing question arises: How is it 
possible for all the efforts of Nakhodka residents to be negated 
because of one figure? The public is offered a solution: Such a 
gloomy picture will not come to pass if Mr. Zavadnikov or, say, 
Mr. Bondarev are appointed as chairman. 
  But Dudnik--he is proclaimed as a henchman of the "red 
directors," having made his career "on the yeast of the 
administrative-command system." 
  Yes, yes. That specifically is the definition which 
respected 
people in the city have acquired, managers of large enterprises 
who in a difficult moment did not leave their collectives to the 
whims of fate, who bore on their shoulders all the burdens of 
the transition to the market. 
  Nakhodka is not such a big city. And the current propensity 
toward power by "those who are rather well-known in the city" 
(the words of NP in quotation marks) and those who are being 
pushed back to rear positions with the coming of Dudnik is quite 
understandable for any sober-minded person. 
  Nakhodka residents had a rather optimistic, though 
nonsynonymous, attitude toward the appointment of S. Dudnik, who 
stood at the wellsprings of the birth of the FEZ, as chairman of 
the administrative committee. However, we must assume that both 
the PROSPEKT and the group of "well-known" people understand 
that the time of tin soldiers and unanimity has passed. 
Moreover, S. Dudkin's announcements regarding the further 
mechanism of development of the FEZ are realistic and do not 
have the slightest divergence from the course which had 
previously been implemented. 
  Who can object to the fact that we need to revitalize decree 
No. 540, which previously gave the FEZ tax and customs benefits, 
or to the fact that, without giving up our former positions, we 
may use the situation in our favor and create mini-zones on the 
basis of ports? 
  It is understandable that NAKHODKINSKIY PROSPECT in this 
case 
earnestly expresses the will of those for whose money it exists. 
It is a shame that such concepts as journalistic ethics and 
human decency are lost here. Yet the money in circulation is 
considerable. What other newspaper with a circulation of 7,000 
can allow itself to have its own Moscow-accredited correspondent 
in the Federal Assembly? In itself, this fact cannot evoke 
anything but joy. There are many really remarkable examples of 
the charity of the new entrepreneurs. However, the current 
actions of the group of "well-known people" are rather far from 
being charitable. 
  And in addition to everything, PROSPEKT evidently likes to 
appear as a political martyr (See UTRO ROSSII, No 17). Economic 
difficulties, difficulties with printing the newspaper which are 
so familiar today to every editorial collective can, after all, 
be presented as being the intrigues of those same "red 
directors"... and of the city administration. 
<H6>  Announcement Issued by the city of Nakhodka Administration 
Press Center </H6>
  In connection with the fact that recently the newspaper 
NAKHODKINSKIY PROSPEKT has been fanning political passions over 
the appointment of the new chairman of the administrative 
committee of the FEZ "Nakhodka," its journalists operate with 
the facts willfully and with bias, giving them an unobjective 
evaluation, and also publish fabrications regarding the 
involvement of the administration in difficulties associated 
with the publication of the newspaper, the administration press 
center is authorized to give the following explanation: 
  1. The appointment of the new administrative committee 
chairman of the FEZ "Nakhodka" was performed in full accordance 
with the standard documents. 
  2. The administration has nothing to do with problems 
associated with the publication of the newspaper NAKHODKINSKIY 
PROSPEKT. The tin can factory, being a joint-stock company, 
makes decisions independently. 
  3. Noting the destructive position of the editors of 
NAKHODKINSKIY PROSPEKT, the city administration retains the 
right to legally verify the correspondence of newspaper 
publications to reality, as well as to the RF [Russian 
Federation] Law on the Mass Media.

<F P=106> [Article, by the Press Service of the State Tax System for </F>
Maritime Kray: "The Rosich Company and Others Have Not Succeeded 
in Evading Taxes"] 
  [Text] The State Tax Inspectorate for Maritime Kray has 
summed up the results of its work in 1993. The total amount of 
all types of taxes that were paid last year both by enterprises, 
organizations, and institutions in the kray and by the residents 
of Maritime Kray came to 701,816,000,000 rubles. That is almost 
ten times more than in 1992. Thirty-five percent of the 
collected taxes were sent to the federal budget. The rest 
(456,511,000,000) remained in the local budget. In the structure 
of all taxes, the taxes with the largest weight are: profit tax 
(44 percent); added value tax (29 percent); and income tax from 
individuals (14 percent). Income from privatization in the kray 
came to 18,366,000,000 rubles. A large part of that amount 
remained in the local budget. 
  An additional sum of 83,357,000,000 rubles was paid into the 
budget as a result of checking that was done by the kray's tax 
inspectorates. Also, the economic situation in the kray and in 
the country could not fail to have an effect on the quality and 
the deadlines for paying the taxes, as well as the penalties in 
the event of late payment or nonpayment. Thus, the increase in 
the number of taxpayers, the increase in prices, and the 
increase in the payment of labor led to a considerable increase 
in the volume of payments. On the other hand, the unstable 
financial situation of enterprises, the delay in the reciprocal 
settlements among them, and the rise in the inflationary 
processes and the indebtedness of enterprises inevitably led to 
late payments and to the reduction or even cessation of tax 
payments on the part of many taxpayers. The increase in arrears 
is also linked with the taxpayers' low discipline. More than 70 
percent of state enterprise, more than 50 percent of municipal 
ones, and one-third of nonstate enterprises were found by the 
tax agencies to have committed various violations in computing 
and paying the profit taxes. 
  Frequently debtor enterprises, because of their complicated 
financial situation, are given payment extensions. In the 
remaining instances the tax inspectorates take steps of 
financial or administrative punishment. More than 6000 officials 
in 1993 were brought to administrative responsibility; almost 
8000 times it was necessary to suspend the violators' financial 
activity. 
  The following are a few examples. In Nakhodka the tax 
inspectorate required the Korkhis TOO [Limited Liability 
Partnership] to pay 45 million rubles as a fine for having 
violated tax legislation. An audit conducted jointly with the 
tax police revealed the concealment of income from the sale of 
vodka behind the cash account at the Masmetna TOO; the violators 
paid 32 million rubles. The Lakkhor TOO failed to enter as 
receipts the proceeds from the sale of motor vehicles; the fines 
came to 15 million rubles. The Vladivostok tax inspectorates, in 
the course of audits, revealed violation of tax legislation at 
the Rybvost, Mortransservis, Vostokvneshservis, and Avtoimport 
joint-stock companies, the Rosich foreign-trade company, etc. 
  In dealing with the most serious violations, the materials 
pertaining to the audits by the tax inspectorates were sent to 
law-enforcement agencies. In 1993 there were 192 files of such 
materials, with the overwhelming number of them (122) pertaining 
to joint-stock companies, limited companies, and other nonstate 
organizations. The Pervomayskiy Rayon tax inspectorate audited 
the activities of the Shelf joint-stock company. As long ago as 
1992 the Vladivostok Base of the Trawler and Refrigerator-Ship 
Fleet (VBTRF) concluded with Shelf a lease contract in 
conformity with which the latter had four fishing ships 
transferred to it, with VBTRF bearing all the expenses for 
maintaining, operating, repairing, and supplying those ships. 
Since it did not have quotas or licenses for exporting fish 
products, Shelf received at the expense of VBTRF 337.1 million 
rubles simply in exchange for selling the fish abroad. The 
founders of Shelf were VBTRF officials headed by N. Nikitenko. 
It was they would received income from the activities of those 
ships, but VBTRF bore the expenses. The tax services considered 
these actions to be a violation of the law, and they lodged an 
official request to the kray procurator's office to initiate a 
criminal case charging the violators with malfeasance. 
Subsequently an audit of the financial activities of VBTRF was 
scheduled, and that audit has been completed at the present 
time. The results will be reported separately. 
  The kray's tax agencies discovered instances in which the 
enterprises violated the regulations for withholding income tax 
from individuals. The largest amounts of funds that were 
additionally computed by the inspectors were for such violators 
as TURNIF, DVMP, Dalpushnina, Roliz, and the Russo-Japanese 
Rikar [Riccar] enterprise. Over a period of several months the 
Ussuriysk railroad-car and refrigerator-car roundhouse failed to 
record the income taxes that had been withheld from citizens. 
The violation was estimated to be a half billion rubles. 
  Approximately 5000 citizens were brought to administrative 
responsibility for having committed violations in the payment of 
taxes from individuals. For example, in Vladivostok, during the 
documentary checking of declarations of income, tax inspectors 
established instances of underreporting of income received by 
two entrepreneurs in 1992, with a total amount of 400,000 
rubles. A total of 153 files of material dealing with the 
results of audits of tax payment by individuals were sent by the 
Vladivostok tax inspectorate to law-enforcement agencies. A 
criminal case involving an instance of concealing income was 
initiated with respect to the director of a branch of the 
Interfeys [Interface] SP [joint venture]. However, that case has 
been currently suspended, inasmuch as the violator is hiding 
from the law-enforcement agencies. 
  The kray's legal inspectorate considers that an important 
aspect of its work is close cooperation with the customs 
services and with the tax police. And a decisive factor in the 
further improvement of the work performed by the tax inspectors, 
in the opinion of its employees, is the serious reforming of the 
tax system in the country.

Primorgeolkom (Maritime Kray Geological Committee): "Stores of 
Mineral Resources Are Being Depleted Rapidly; Geological Service 
Today Is on the Brink of Collapse; Urgent Measures Are Needed To 
Retain Highly Qualified Personnel"] 
  [Text] Does Russia need a geological service? This question 
is being asked more and more often by specialists who have 
dedicated their entire life to a difficult profession. The 
economic crisis has dealt a powerful blow to very important 
industries. But only time-servers can be indifferent to the 
curtailment in prospecting work. Because geology is fundamental 
to the mineral-raw material base of any industrial power. 
Therefore, it has always enjoyed the support of the state. 
  Let us look at history. In the period of the origin of 
capitalism in Russia, the tsarist government organized a central 
geological institution--the Geological Committee--to supply 
developing industry with mineral raw materials. The committee 
was instructed to conduct general geological study of the 
territory all the way to the Pacific Ocean. The work of the 
Geolkom [Geological Committee] was participated in by prominent 
geologist-scientists A.P. Karpinskiy and V.A. Obruchev, and E.E. 
Anert, a mineral prospector of the Far East, especially Maritime 
Kray. By 1914 the principles of knowledge of the geological 
structure of Russia had been laid and many deposits of mineral 
resources discovered. 
  After the civil war, in order to restore the destroyed 
economy, once again it was mineral fuels (coal, peat, oil) that 
were needed most of all, but also iron, nonferrous metals, and 
precious metals. Life raised the question of creating a 
multicomponent mineral-raw material base for the country. But 
there were not enough specialists. Geological VUZ's [higher 
educational institutions] and faculties began to be established 
in many cities of Russia, including Vladivostok. 
  The network of industrial geological organizations was 
expanding. Numerous trusts were established in place of the 
geological committee. One of them appeared in Vladivostok. As a 
result, in two decades of development of geological work, the 
powerful mineral-raw materials base of the Soviet Union was 
established. It provided the industry of our country with all 
that was necessary by the start of the Great Patriotic War. 
  During the war years geological exploration, although cut 
back, did not stop. Many specialists, despite the enormous human 
losses at the front, were not drafted into the regular army for 
the sake of new discoveries of minerals. Immediately after the 
war prospecting work began to gather even more steam--especially 
in Siberia and the Far East. 
  Practically in the postwar period a mineral base was created 
in the Far East and Transbaykal region for the mining of tin, 
tungsten, polymetals, fluor-spar, boron, uranium, rare metals, 
gold, and building materials. On the whole in the country 
thousands of deposits of minerals needed by industry and 
agriculture were discovered and prospected. 
  But only dilettantes could have been complacent when they 
decided that the large backlog of stores of all minerals was 
more than they could cope with and, consequently, searches and 
prospecting for new deposits could be cut back for many years 
(or entirely stopped). It must not be forgotten that after the 
October Revolution we used discoveries acquired at the end of 
the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. At the present 
time we are using the results of geological prospecting of 
recent decades. 
  It must be remembered that mineral resources are not 
limitless and that they are being irretrievably depleted. New 
discoveries of deposits are being made more and more frequently 
at great depths and in sparsely populated rayons. Often decades 
are spent prospecting and assimilating deposits. It is necessary 
to know that approximately 75 percent of the raw materials for 
the national economy are taken from the earth's depths. That is 
why it is necessary to have systematic and continuous production 
of all types of geological prospecting operations. It should not 
be forgotten that with the dissolution of the Union, Russia was 
left without chromium, manganese, uranium, and titanium. The 
current generation is obliged to create a mineral-raw material 
reserve in mineral resources for subsequent generations, as was 
done for us by our fathers and grandfathers. 
  Central television recently reported the information that 
revealed reserves of gold in the interior of Russia were enough 
for 35 years of exploitation. As a specialist, I will say 
something else--gold-mining will come to a halt within three to 
five years if gold prospecting operations are stopped. 
  Nevertheless, Russia's powerful geological service has been 
virtually destroyed. At the present time about 10 percent of the 
volume of work it had 10 years ago remains. Hundreds of 
qualified geologists, drilling technicians, and geophysicists in 
Maritime Kray, like in all of Russia, are being forced to look 
for other work. 
  A further reduction is expected this year in centralized 
appropriations. The state is planning to finance geological work 
in a small volume on the scale of 1:200000, monitoring of the 
geological environment, and predicting earthquakes. A geological 
service is being established for this. 
  It is planned to conduct search and prospecting for deposits 
at the expense of the resources of the mineral users. At the 
present time a federal tax is collected from enterprises that 
are exploiting deposits for supplying the mineral-raw material 
base. More specifically, for the conduct of geological 
prospecting work. In the next year or two this tax will in all 
probability be eliminated, which will lead to a further cut in 
the volume of exploring and prospecting for minerals. 
  We are already planning not to go into the field this year. 
Available resources are being directed at curtailing and 
eliminating labor collectives of geological prospectors. The 
state has practically abandoned financing the geology industry. 
Therefore, several ways of reorganizing state geological 
organizations in the future are being examined: The shift of 
former expeditions to the staff of mining enterprises, the 
establishment of integrated geological exploitation enterprises, 
fully reprofiled geological organizations, or their elimination. 
The remaining enterprises will be converted into joint-stock 
companies and privatized. 
  But geological personnel will be cut under any 
reorganization. The mining enterprises of Russia that need the 
work of geologists cannot finance them in full measure, because 
they themselves are living through great difficulties. Even gold 
mining has been reduced. 
  Counting on foreign investments in the Russian mining 
industry is very illusory. After all, the world mineral raw 
material market was formed without taking the potential of the 
former USSR and Russia into account, and is saturated with raw 
materials at the present time, as indicated by the continuous 
drop in prices. Only diamonds, gold, oil, and gas are enjoying 
increased demand. 
  In addition, many foreign deposits surpass ours in quality 
of 
ores and mining conditions for geological exploitation. The cost 
of the development of a number of deposits in Russia is more 
expensive than in countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 
Foreign investors are also frightened off by our economic 
disarray and political instability. 
  Inasmuch as Russian, including Maritime, geologists have 
high 
qualifications and a lot of practical experience, they could 
work effectively in any foreign country. In previous years 
Soviet geologists (including Maritime geologists) were used 
successfully in dozens of countries of the world and on all 
continents except Australia. 
  Under conditions of a developing market, geology in Russia 
has been placed in a situation of having to fight for its own 
survival. That is, not waiting for encouraging decisions and 
handouts from the top, but determining its own fate 
independently. The main thing for us now is to preserve the 
qualified pool of personnel. For we have no doubt: The country's 
need to intensify geological work will rise in the next few 
years.

"Will It Be Necessary To Open Up the Far East All Over Again?"] 
  [Text] Taking into account the extreme situation that 
has taken form in the economy of Khabarovsk Kray in connection 
with the liberalization of prices for energy sources and the 
raising of transport rates, and also with a view to stabilizing 
the socioeconomic situation in the kray, the Council of 
Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation 
decrees: 
  1. The State Committee of the Russian Federation 
Committee on the Socioeconomic Development of the North, the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Economics, and the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Finance, jointly with the administration 
of Khabarovsk Kray, shall, before 1 January 1994, present to the 
Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation a 
proposal on the inclusion of the entire territory of Khabarovsk 
Kray on the list of localities that are considered pertaining to 
the Far North by virtue of the conditions of delivery and 
transport of output of production and technical designation and 
of consumer goods. 
  2. The Russian Federation Ministry of Finance, the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Economics, and the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy, for the maintenance of 
the cost of one kilowatt-hour of electrical energy at the level 
of 40 rubles [R] (rated cost), shall provide for the 
apportionment to the Khabarovsk Kray Administration of R19.6 
billion from the Russian Federation's republic budget, as a 
selective targeted subsidy for November-December 1993, for 
compensation for the difference between the cost of electrical 
energy put out by the Khabarovskenergo joint-stock company and 
the rated cost.... 
  (From the government decree "On Measures for 
Stabilization of the Socioeconomic Situation in Khabarovsk Kray 
for 1993-1994." Analogous documents were adopted for Maritime 
Kray and Sakhalin Oblast.) 
  Khabarovsk--Last August, during a trip around the eastern 
regions of the country, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin promised 
that the state would, without fail, close out its debt to the 
defense complex in September. And of course, he vowed, the 
government would not allow the economic potential of the Far 
East and the Transbaykal region, which occupy more than 40 
percent of the entire Russian territory, and which for that 
reason play an important geopolitical role in the fate of the 
whole country, to collapse utterly. "We came here in order to 
examine the problems and to try to come to some solution," said 
Viktor Stepanovich, at a meeting in Khabarovsk Kray. 
  "Not only have the circumstances in the region after your 
visit only failed to stabilize, they have gotten worse," reads 
the address to V.S. Chernomyrdin and signed by the heads of 
administration of nine eastern krays and oblasts five months 
later. The authors of the message explain the situation that has 
taken shape by an inadequate appraisal of the specific features 
of the region and by a disregard on the part of the central 
authorities for the interests of the Far East. The ministries 
and departments are in no hurry to carry out the government 
decree, which was adopted in October-December of last year with 
respect to individual territories of this extensive kray. 
Although there has been little success with the concrete 
promises that were made during last year's trips, either (at 
that time, in addition to the prime minister, almost all of his 
deputies also visited the East). 
  If a few months ago, the defense plants of the Amur region 
were demanding R30-40 billion of the government for output 
already produced, today this debt has reached R70 billion. 
Because of a shortage of financial resources, many enterprises 
are operating at only 30-50 percent of production capacity. And 
since enterprises of the military-industrial complex in the Far 
East have a significant specific gravity, they are objectively 
turning into a millstone around the neck of the regional 
economy. Should we be surprised that at the end of last year the 
slump in production in that same Khabarovsk Kray amounted to 22 
percent? 
  Other state programs are also being carried out in an 
analogous way. For example, in 1993 the Amur region was allotted 
only 37 percent of the funds it needed from the federal budget 
for the construction of housing for servicemen who had been 
released into the reserves. As a result, it was possible here to 
rent out only 15,000 square meters of new living space, instead 
of 70,000. The agro-industrial complex received an amount that 
was short approximately R10 billion from the budget. The large 
debt that Moscow owes the people of the Amur region is also for 
the organization of freight deliveries to the northern regions. 
Last year they delivered everything necessary there on a timely 
basis. But the government is to this day in no hurry to 
apportion all of the financial resources promised for this. 
  At the Khabarovsk Kray Economics Committee it was calculated 
that, in order to resolve the territory's most burning problems 
today, about R100 billion is necessary. One should take into 
account the fact that the Amur region, by virtue of its 
remoteness, must endure the pressure of completely impossible 
transport rates and must pay more for energy resources. All of 
this is shifted to the output produced here, which becomes 
simply noncompetitive because of its high price. 
  How to get out of this dead-end situation--where to find the 
money necessary for this? At the end of January, Viktor Ishayev, 
head of the kray administration, was compelled to introduce an 
emergency regime in the area of financial guarantees. It was not 
from good living that he, at one press conference, even 
announced the temporary cessation of tax appropriations to the 
federal budget. True, Aleksandr Katsuba, head of the finance 
administration, later hastened to explain to the journalists 
that they had misunderstood the governor.... Although, if you 
think about it, the people of Amur region have absolutely 
nothing to deduct in any case. 
  Everyone needs money today. The deputy head of the 
Khabarovsk 
Kray administration, who is also the chairman of the economics 
committee, Aleksandr Levintal, with whom I talked about today's 
situation in the Amur region, is convinced that until the 
government, for populist considerations, just patches up the 
financial holes, the federal budget will remind us of Trishka's 
caftan, which unraveled in another place every time a hole was 
mended. The main thing, Levintal believes, should still be the 
balancing of the budget, oriented, as much as possible, on 
tomorrow. At the very least, it is important to the people of 
the Far East that the offices in Moscow take heed of the 
specific peculiarities of a region that is compelled, simply by 
virtue of its remoteness, to bear considerable expenses and 
outlays. 
  But standing up for their righteousness, the local 
administration workers must, sometimes not without a fight, 
overcome rigid barriers of the simply inimitable government 
bureaucracy. A. Levintal cited this example. In the Decree "On 
Measures for Stabilization of the Socioeconomic Situation in 
Khabarovsk Kray for 1993-1996," which was signed by V. 
Chernomyrdin back on 4 December, the Ministry of Economics and 
the Ministry of Finance were to work out within a month's time a 
proposal on the targeted allocation of 20 percent of customs 
duties for the development of the foreign economic 
infrastructure of the Amur region. But for the bureaucrats this 
document of the prime minister's did not signify a call to 
action. First of all, if that was necessary for the Far 
Easterners, then they themselves should come to Moscow and 
collect all the numerous signatures, again independently pushing 
the necessary documents through the necessary levels. Otherwise, 
they simply get lost in government folders. So this is already 
the second month that they are wandering the corridors of power. 
In the second place, the formula "work out and introduce for 
approval" by no means signifies that this should be done some 
time in the future. Today, for example, the negative attitude 
toward the given point in the government decree of the currency 
department of the Ministry of Finance is well known. Planning on 
sending this 20 percent of the collected duties for the 
construction of border customs crossings in Khabarovsk Kray, it 
is orienting itself on the interests of Russia. After all, the 
deductions from the profit received during the exploitation of 
the customs crossings would be covered by none other than the 
federal budget. Does Moscow really not understand this? 
  In the end, it must be taken into account that only more 
than 
[as published] 10 million people live in the Far East and 
Transbaykal, which occupy, as I have already said, more than 40 
percent of Russian territory. To ignore the interests of people 
who live under more than specific conditions is more than 
unwise. Let us just hope that in the near future we will not 
need a new Dezhnev and Khabarov to again open up and develop in 
Russia these severe but amazing parts.

<F P=106> [Text of excerpts of statement by Yuriy Luzhkov, mayor of </F>
Moscow, selected by Nikolay Andreyev: "Yu. Luzhkov: `Moscow 
Without a Market Is Doomed'"] 
  [Text] As we have 
already reported, a few days ago the mayor of the capital gave a 
report on the government's work last year and the program for 
the present year. I think Muscovites will be interested to read 
excerpts from Yuriy Luzhkov's statement. 
  We cannot boast of the fact that last year industrial 
production was stabilized, but the rate of decline has slowed 
and it is substantially lower than for Russia as a whole. The 
food industry increased production volumes by 4.7 percent. The 
extremely large Kreker dry cereal plant has been launched, a 
large brewery is near completion, and 12 bakeries and many 
sausage shops and small breweries have been built in the 
microrayons. The main goal is to bring "food" closer to 
residents and employ at least 30 percent of the working-age 
population in food processing and other small-scale production. 
  The capital's government fulfilled the promise given to 
Muscovites and had more than 3 million square meters of housing 
commissioned, including 1 million in free municipal housing. We 
will continue to refuse to consider abandoning people on the 
waiting lists, as has been done in many regions of Russia and 
the CIS countries, which "bid farewell" to the lists. Last year 
26 schools, 30 kindergartens, 12 polyclinics, and 4 hospitals 
were opened in the new housing developments. 
  The capital's government implemented a targeted structural 
policy on social protection of those Muscovites who found 
themselves in a most difficult position upon the change-over to 
a market basis. Spent for these purposes were 93 billion rubles 
[R], which were used to support 3.5 million Muscovites: 
pensioners, disabled persons, children, war veterans, and other 
categories of citizens. This year the social orientation of city 
programs will be bolstered even more: in the first stage alone 
the city will allocate R450 billion for social needs. We intend 
to systematically index compensation payments to Muscovites, 
which will allow us not to lower the level of their support and 
to prevent tragedies. Unfortunately, we can only dream of 
anything beyond that. 
  I want to emphasize especially that talk of daring decisions 
in the field of reforming the economy without supporting those 
people who are in a difficult position through no fault of their 
own is simply unacceptable and all the reforms are doomed. 
  In the past year market structures have continued to be 
vigorously developed in Moscow. As of now, about 40 percent of 
industrial production, 85 percent of transport, and 90 percent 
of trade and domestic enterprises at the municipal and city 
levels are no longer state-owned. Operating in the capital, not 
counting branches, are 350 commercial banks and many business 
houses, exchanges, and insurance companies. The small business 
sphere produces 15 percent of the city's volume of consumer 
goods. All this is the reality of market transformations. 
Without them, and I say this with all responsibility, Moscow 
would not have survived 1993. We will continue to develop and 
qualitatively improve market relations and conduct 
privatization, but not in the Chubays way where enterprises are 
sold not as objects for expanded reproduction but as ordinary 
real estate. Otherwise, it may happen that small groups of 
people buy up these enterprises and do not work on production 
but sell them at speculative prices, having acquired them 
virtually for kopecks. We intend to leave certain elements of 
property at the municipal, city level, while privatized property 
will be sold, replenishing the federal and capital treasuries. 
  Public law and order is a painful issue for Moscow. It has 
always been a focus of attention of the capital's government. 
Not because of our allegations, but by announcement of the 
leaders of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, last year 
the city did more for the law enforcement organs than in all the 
years of Soviet power. About R40 billion were allocated and 40 
special purpose integrated objects with contemporary equipment 
were built to develop the law enforcement organs' 
material-technical base. Much equipment was bought for GAI 
[State Automobile Inspectorate] to do operational work, as well 
as special devices for operational brigades in the fight against 
organized crime. And now, not just in the future, we have a 
right to demand of the militsia that they fundamentally change 
their work and provide reliable protection of Muscovites and 
commercial structures from different kinds of criminals. 
  We promised last year to put in order and pave 15 million 
square meters of Moscow roads, streets, and courtyards with 
asphalt, but 3.5 million beyond that has been done. In terms of 
volume of road repair, Moscow is at the level of the largest 
capitals of the world, but we are justifiably criticized for the 
lack of quality, just as we are for the poor job of cleaning up 
the city and the work of the law enforcement structures. This 
year should be a critical one on these issues. 
  Although we entered 1994 without a budget deficit, the 
economic situation is very bad. The federal government did not 
pay its debt of R142 billion to Moscow. The situation is not 
clear in terms of tax deductions and compensation payments for 
expenditures for fulfilling the functions of a capital city, and 
up to this point the embassies, representations, and various 
state institutions have not paid the city for land and 
buildings. We are asked to pay R3.4 trillion to maintain and 
develop the capital's subway system, but even here the federal 
government has not kept its promise, putting everything on the 
city's shoulders. 
  Moreover, I recently found out from a solid, reliable source 
that Russia's Ministry of Finance aspires to somehow balance the 
budget by abolishing all subventions to Moscow for it to perform 
its functions as the capital. Just what kind of sense does it 
make to try to make ends meet in the budget by ignoring all 
expenditures which the state is committed to make both in the 
regions and in the capital? Or do the functionaries from the 
Ministry of Finance want very much to impress the State Duma? 
  And the last thing, the food supply of Moscow. Without 
relying on anyone, the capital's government and its appropriate 
departments established close contacts with many Russian regions 
and foreign firms, so that the food situation last year was 
calm, just as, we hope, it will be this year. 
  In short, the course of the Moscow government is the same: 
to 
develop the market, bolster social protection of Muscovites, 
stabilize industry, and augment construction of contemporary 
housing while providing free housing to people on the waiting 
lists on a mandatory basis.

<F P=106> [Interview with N. Didenko, by T. Taten and Yu. Belous: </F>
"Foreigners in Russia"] 
  [Text] Nikolay Didenko, department chief of the 
Moscow OVIR [Visa and Registration Department], answers 
questions asked by TOP-TURA correspondents Tatyana Taten and 
Yuriy Belous. 
  [Correspondents] Nikolay Naumovich, what are the basic 
statutes governing foreigners' stay in Russia? On what laws do 
you rely in your work? 
  [Didenko] Our work today is defined, first of all, by the 
law 
entitled "Legal Status of Foreign Citizens in the USSR," which 
was enacted as long ago as 1985. The second normative act is the 
26 April 1991 Cabinet of Ministers decree, entitled 
"Confirmation of the Rules for the Stay of Foreign Citizens in 
the USSR." All categories of foreign cities residing on the 
territory of Russia are required, within three working days, to 
obtain a residence permit (to register). The registration points 
for various categories of citizens are the Russian MID [Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs], hotels, and internal affairs agencies 
(rayon OVIR's register students, postgraduate students, and 
probationary workers, as well as private trips). Today, 
according to our information, 81,106 foreigners have been 
registered in Moscow. 
  [Correspondents] But the figures that pop up in the 
newspapers say something else: today, according to tentative 
computations, there are 200,000 Chinese alone in Moscow! What is 
your attitude toward these statistics? 
  [Didenko] There actually are a very large number of illegal 
aliens and refugees in Moscow currently. For example, Kurds 
arrive in large groups and demand that the Russian authorities 
recognize the Geneva Convention on Kurdish refugees. They come 
to Moscow by way of Azerbaijan, without any KPP [control and 
checkpoint] stamps in their passports. Until recently, this 
category of citizens caused us a lot of trouble. Today Russia 
has already enacted the Law Governing Displaced Persons, and the 
federal authorities in our country are ready to begin working 
with them. For example, they will be issued identification 
cards. We want to complete this work by 1 April. Unfortunately, 
today Russia has transparent borders with almost all the former 
republics, so that it is very simple to get here... 
  [Correspondents] Previously the foreigners who came here 
were 
limited in their movements around the country. For example, a 
visa was required for visiting another city. What is the 
situation today? 
  [Didenko] Yes, that used to be the rule, and foreigners did 
not have the right to leave without special authorization the 
republic or city where they were registered. Today that rule has 
been simplified: foreigners can move freely across the entire 
territory of Russia, but with the mandatory notification of the 
receiving organization or internal affairs agencies and with 
mandatory registration at the place of temporary stay. 
  [Correspondents] But what if our guest does not do that? 
  [Didenko] He is fined half the minimum (Russian) wages 
(today 
the amount of the fine is 7000 rubles, or $5.00), or the period 
of his stay is reduced. 
  [Correspondents] Are there any distant foreign countries 
today whose citizens can enter Russia without a visa? 
  [Didenko] There are ten such countries. They are the former 
countries of the socialist camp, with the government of which 
agreements governing nonvisa trips have been concluded. 
  [Correspondents] Do you think that it is necessary to 
toughen 
the measures with respect to those foreigners who arrive here 
illegally? 
  [Didenko] Forced eviction under convoy from the territory of 
Russia occurs with the procurator's sanction. But first we send 
a warning to citizens who have failed to observe the visa rules. 
Eviction is the extreme measure and, despite the fact that it 
occurs at the "violator's" expense, for us this procedure is 
extremely wasteful. Of course, it is possible to deliver Chinese 
as far as the border on a train. But there exist countries with 
which Russia does not have common borders, or even direct 
flights. It is impossible to deliver someone from Somalia to his 
country, inasmuch as there exists a currency "air" sector beyond 
which we have to pay a considerable amount of money. I might 
mention in passing that all other countries do not accept this 
category of citizens and do not issue visas (not even through 
visas!) to them. At the present time a new plan has been 
developed for foreigners' stay in Russia, as well as new rules 
governing through travel. I assume that we shall receive the new 
law this year. 
  [Correspondents] Could we speak a bit now about the nearby 
foreign countries? 
  [Didenko] Until a visa system has been established with 
these 
countries, the relations with them will be subordinated to the 
government's decisions. Problems of entry from or departure to 
the nearby foreign countries do not affect us UVIR [Visa and 
Registration Administration] workers. As for the Baltic 
countries, as everyone one, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
established visa entry long ago. It is possible to enter those 
republics only if one has in his possession a nationally issued 
foreign passport. But Russia also, in its turn, has established 
visa entry for citizens of those countries. But for those who 
have not received a passport from any of the Baltic countries 
and who have remained, essentially speaking, a citizen of 
Russia, no visas are required for coming here. 
  [Correspondents] In previous years a rather large number of 
so-called "mixed" marriages were concluded. Is it possible, for 
example, for a female citizen of Estonia to obtain Russian 
citizenship if her husband is Russian? 
  [Didenko] First of all, that family must decide where the 
married couple will reside -- in Russia or in Estonia. If they 
have decided that they will live, for example, in Moscow, then 
the female citizen of Estonia must enter Russia on a visa that 
has been registered at the OVIR. We can consider the question of 
her permanent residence with her husband, can issue a residence 
permit, and can file an official request that she be given 
citizenship. But as for the question of dual citizenship, that 
is the president's competency. 
  [Correspondents] Finally, a question that interests many of 
our readers. In various publications one sees announcements 
saying things like, "We can get you a foreign passport quickly." 
Aren't you embarrassed by what your competitors can do? 
  [Didenko] I would like to say a few words specifically about 
this. The duty for formalizing a nationally issued foreign 
passport is two minimum wages -- less than 30,000 rubles. But 
there are people who are ready to pay $100 or more to some 
home-grown companies for the very same services. As a result, 
they receive documents with the seals of nonexistent countries 
-- in effect, fraudulent homemade documents with which it is 
possible to get only as far as Sheremetyevo. We have had a very 
large number of instances like this. It may indeed be true that 
we do not work fast enough, but a genuine passport can be 
obtained today only from the hands of MID or OVIR workers. So it 
makes sense to wait a month and get a passport that is valid for 
five years -- a genuine passport with which you will not be 
"requested" to go back when you reach the border.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Frolov, report on population's health with </F>
table on cancer mortality rate, and report on counterfeit 
therapeutic balms by A. I. Leontyev, under the rubric "House of 
Nature": "The White Book of Moscow"] 
  [Text] [A. Frolov] 
  The White Book "State Report on the Condition of the Natural 
Environment of the City of Moscow" has been published for the 
first time in the city's history. 
  The report was prepared by decision No. 18 of the presidium 
of the Mossovet dated 15 April 1993. The client was 
Moskomprirody [Moscow Nature Committee] and the chief agent was 
the Moscow Special Purpose Fund "Ecology and the Condition of 
the Living Environment" (MTsF ESSO ["Moskovskiy tselevoy fond 
`Ekologiya i sostoyaniye sredy obitaniya'"]. The chairman of the 
editorial board was A. V. Yablokov. 
  For decades the city's nature protection organs maintained a 
humble silence regarding the activity of the city authorities 
and the Council of Ministers nomenklatura, who turned Moscow 
into an ecological disaster zone. 
  This humility cost Muscovites dearly--millions of residents 
have died 8-10 years early and hundreds of thousands of children 
have been born with birth defects and pathologies. 
  This humility cost the state dearly too--each person who 
died 
early or became disabled could have benefited society. Just the 
cost of treatment and sick leave eats up hundreds of billions of 
rubles. 
  This humility left the managers of hundreds of small 
"Chernobyl's" which contaminated the city unpunished and doomed 
any good ecological programs to failure for a lack of objective 
information. 
  But now the first breach has appeared in the wall of 
silence--the White Book of Moscow, which for the first time 
makes it possible to assess the condition of the living 
environment and the population's health both for the city as a 
whole and by individual zones. 
  There is no reason to retell the report's content. Suffice 
it 
to say that the report includes chapters which characterize the 
natural conditions in the city, the condition of the atmospheric 
air, water resources, soils, and the plant and animal worlds, 
the scope of technogenic impact, radiation, noise, and 
electromagnetic pollution, technogenic changes in the geological 
milieu, the state of public health, and the activity of the 
nature protection organizations. The report includes more than 
40 maps and figures which for the first time make it possible to 
comprehensively assess the condition of the living environment. 
  I am certain that every Muscovite will be interested to know 
the report's contents and find out just what is happening in his 
microrayon and on his street. 
  But the history of the report's appearance is no less 
interesting. 
  First, the report appeared against the bureaucrats' wishes. 
The city administration deliberately did absolutely nothing to 
prepare it, hoping that the idea would die of itself. A 
paradoxical fact is that the State Report was financed not from 
the city budget but at the expense of the City Ecology Fund. 
Only the sincere enthusiasm and the unselfishness, rare in our 
times, of the researchers enabled this unique publication to be 
prepared. 
  They were able to defend the principle that it is first of 
all the performing organization that determines the report's 
content; and that organization was MTSF "ESSO," which hired such 
organizations as MGU [Moscow State University], MosTsGMS, IMGRE 
[Institute of Mineralogy, Geochemistry, and Crystallochemistry 
of Rare Elements], VIMS [All-Russian Scientific Research 
Institute of Mineral Raw Materials], GMPP of Aerogeology, MGTs 
SEN, NIiPI Genplana, Geoekotsentr [Geoecocenter], and others, in 
all more than 20 organizations. In preparing the report they 
managed to avoid nomenklatura censorship or being placed under 
the eye of the latest city "father." 
  Taking into account the trend toward restoration of the 
nomenklatura dictatorship in Russia, it is quite possible that 
the report will become a bibliographic rarity. One may predict 
that subsequent reports, if they are prepared, will be done with 
proper humility. 
  Of course, the report was no great revelation. It once again 
used the example of Moscow to prove that the condition of the 
environment is the dirtiest secret of the obsolete totalitarian 
state. But the report gives an objective and fairly frightening 
picture of the party-management nomenklatura's genocide against 
its own people. 
  Much of what was intended in the report was not 
accomplished. 
The trends toward change in the condition of the environment 
were not followed for a long period of time, a substantiated 
prediction of the possible consequences of maintaining the 
present attitude toward nature was not given, comparative data 
with other major cities of the world were not given, the 
correlation between certain types of diseases and environmental 
pollution was not specified, and economic substantiation of the 
benefits of rational nature use was not given. 
  The report will be useful to teachers in schools, students, 
businessmen who occupy city real estate, bureaucrats making 
decisions, and simply Muscovites who love their city. 
  I would like to thank everyone who took part in preparing 
the 
report. In 15 years, or even in 50 years, this book will be 
remembered as the basis which first gave comprehensive 
information on the city of Moscow, information against which all 
subsequent changes will be compared. I would very much hope that 
the changes will be for the better. That was the reason the 
report was prepared.

the report. 
<H5>  The Population's Health </H5>
  From 1985 through 1990, indicators of natural population 
growth differed by regions of the city of Moscow. The highest 
natural population growth per 1,000 inhabitants was found in 
Zelenograd (+4.3) and Solntsevo (+3.3). There was negative 
natural growth in Frunzenskiy Rayon (-6.4), Pervomayskiy Rayon 
(-5.5), Leningradskiy Rayon (-5.2), and Oktyabrskiy Rayon (-5.1). 
  Against the background of the sharp drop in the birth rate, 
the proportion of children born with developmental defects is 
rising. The mortality rate of the population in the city of 
Moscow is gradually increasing, by 2-3 percent a year beginning 
in 1987. In 1991 the mortality rate was a record for the last 30 
years. Child mortality is a most important indicator of a 
society's health. In the last 5 year period, an average of 2,923 
children 14 years of age and under and 527 adolescents aged 
15-19 years died every year. Infant mortality (children under 1 
year old) is of most significance in describing the population's 
sanitary-hygienic condition. In the early 1980s, around 20 
children died per 1,000 births. This indicator has now dropped 
to 15. Birth defects and birth-related deaths dominate in the 
structure of infant mortality. That is the cause of death of 
75-83 percent of the infants. 
  Mortality from diseases of the respiratory organs is 
significant (17 per 10,000 births). Children over 1 year of age 
most often died from injuries and accidents (2 per 10,000), 
birth defects (1.75), or tumors (1.6). Adolescent mortality rose 
from 8.3 per 10,000 in 1987 to 10.4 in 1991. More than 50 
percent of the adolescents die of injuries and accidents and 
about 15 percent of them die of tumors. 
  Mortality among working-age Muscovites was 50.5 per 10,000. 
The working-age population dies at a rate 6 times higher than 
that of people aged 2-19. Over the last 5 years, an increase has 
been observed in the mortality rate of the working-age 
population. The greatest increase in the mortality rate was 
found among persons 30-40 years of age. The main causes of death 
among the working-age population of the city of Moscow are heart 
and vascular diseases--33.8 percent, tumors--26.1 percent, and 
injuries and accidents--24.4 percent. As compared with 1988, 
mortality rate indicators from injuries and accidents rose by 61 
percent in 1991, and from tumors and cardiovascular diseases--by 
16 percent and 15 percent, respectively. The cancer mortality 
rate in the city of Moscow in the last 30 years is on a steady 
increase. Thus, the mortality rate indicator from lung cancer 
was 26.8 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1959 as compared to 36.3 in 
1989, while for stomach cancer this indicator dropped from 71.8 
to 41.7. Mortality from cancer of other parts of the body is 
rising gradually. High indicators of cancer mortality which were 
substantially above the average city level were found in six of 
the city's rayons: Kalininskiy, Kiyevskiy, Zheleznodorozhnyy, 
Sevastopolskiy, and Solntsevskiy rayons and the city of 
Zelenograd. Average life expectancy for those born in Moscow 
from 1980 through 1991 is 69 years.

<H5>  Attention: Counterfeit! [by A. I. Leontyev] </H5>
  Not only money but even Karavayev therapeutic balms are 
being 
counterfeited. 
  Almost 3 years ago the Public Fund To Promote Research and 
Initiatives of Citizens on Making Man and the Environment 
Healthy was set up in Moscow; it was named after V. V. 
Karavayev, the philosopher and scientist who formulated the 
integrated preventive-therapeutic system. 
  A person can be healthy only when the three basic metabolic 
processes in his system occur normally, Karavayev asserted. They 
include a physiologically normal diet, breathing, and the 
exchange of mental information (thinking). Any deviation in 
these processes has an immediate effect on the acid-base 
equilibrium (ABE) in the blood. Each person can ascertain the 
ABE in his blood by the color of the conjunctiva (the inside 
surface of the lower eyelid). Normally it is bright pink. If 
there is a skew toward the alkaline, it is dark red to beet red. 
With a skew toward acidic, it is pale pink. For most of our 
fellow countrymen, the ABE of the blood is skewed toward acidic 
(acidosis). 
  Karavayev balms, which affect the skin and mucous membranes, 
are one way to restore the balance. They are Vitaon, a butyric 
extract, Auron, a hydrous extract, and Somaton, a 
hydrous-butyric extract, from medicinal plants. There are from 9 
to 13 medicinal herbs in them, including St. John's wort, 
yarrow, mint, calendula, licorice, thyme, and others. 
  The therapeutic qualities of the balms are unique, and 
urologists, stomatologists, gynecologists, gastroenterologists, 
radiologists, and other specialists immediately started to use 
them. 
  The Karavayev Fund developed the technology and organized 
industrial production of the balms. They immediately became 
popular among Muscovites and do not last long on pharmacy 
shelves. 
  Unfortunately, slick operators have recently, at the peak of 
the balms' popularity, begun moving in: counterfeit Karavayev 
balms have appeared, poured into similar bottles and with 
Karavayev labels. But the counterfeits do not have the 
therapeutic effect inherent in the real Karavayev balms. One can 
distinguish the Karavayev balms from the counterfeits only by 
looking at the quality passport on the Karavayev balms. The seal 
and stamp of the Karavayev Fund should be there. 
  So before you lay down your good money, ask the manager of 
the pharmacy to show you the appropriate documents.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Yezhkov: "Special Services `Listened' in </F>
on Property Fund: Preliminary Investigation in `Fishkov Case' 
Complete"] 
  [Text] On 5 February the deadline expired for a 
four-month investigation in the case of Aleksandr Fishkov, 
deputy general director of the Petersburg Property Fund. The day 
before, the investigation presented formal charges in the final 
wording to the accused and his attorney, and made available to 
them four volumes of the criminal investigation. Fishkov is 
currently being charged under three articles: 
172-a--"Negligence;" 88-1--"Illegal foreign currency 
operations;" and the recently introduced 170-1--"Abuse of 
official position." 
  Let us recall that Aleksandr Fishkov, who was responsible 
for 
conducting voucher auctions in the Property Fund, was arrested 
on 7 October of last year during an interrogation at the GUVD 
[City Administration of Internal Affairs] administration for 
combating economic crimes. The cause for initiating criminal 
proceedings was the discovery that the fund was short 13,500 
privatization vouchers. Property fund employees in positions of 
responsibility were unable to explain how such a quantity of 
vouchers had disappeared from the fund; whether they had been 
canceled or not; and, generally, whether these vouchers had 
physically existed or had only been recorded in documents. 
  Soon after Fishkov's arrest, however, privatization vouchers 
and this official's activities in the fund quickly ceased being 
the main subject of his interrogations. Most of all, law 
enforcement organs were interested in a dacha in Repino 
settlement, purchased with Fishkov's parents' money. The 
prosecution insists that Aleksandr Fishkov paid for the dacha in 
cash in foreign currency and hence violated existing legislation. 
  The Oktyabrskiy Rayon People's Court twice declined the 
defense attorney's petition to change the measure to secure the 
appearance of the accused to a pledge not to leave town--in 
October last year and January this year. In both instances the 
court cited as the main argument for its ruling the presence in 
the charges of the "grave" Article 88 and Fishkov's high 
position before his arrest. 
  Since the completion of the preliminary investigation is the 
time to summarize the initial results, one cannot fail to note 
the investigation time frame, which set a record by current 
standards. These days not every criminal case involving petty 
theft can be squeezed into four months. As to sensational 
cases--of which there have been quite a few lately--they drag 
on, as a rule, for more than a year. The "grave" Article 88 
permitted them to extend the investigation in Fishkov's case for 
up to a year and a half. Moreover, even the city procurator 
could authorize a six-month investigation term, without having 
to go Moscow for permission. Nevertheless, the investigator 
asked for only four months, got it with no problem, 
and--completed it on time. 
  The official explanation for such unprecedented vigor is 
obvious: The investigator chooses the time frame at his 
discretion. Keeping in mind, however, that the accused 
languishes in jail, it is in the interests of operative 
services, as a rule, to drag it out. The "client" is right 
there; you can work with him at an unhurried pace. The longer he 
stays there, the worse his psychological state of mind and the 
greater the chance of obtaining new interesting information from 
him. 
  The only explanation of the "Fishkov phenomenon" worth 
looking at is in the area of political considerations. The 
criminal case against Fishkov occurred at the time of another 
round of radical changes in the disposition of forces on the 
political scene. What was topical four months ago may possibly 
produce completely the reverse effect today, or lose 
significance altogether. 
  Before the October armed clash the opposing forces actively 
looked for compromising materials on each other. Suffice it to 
recall the Yakubovskiy theme that was a permanent fixture in 
newspapers. The special services turned to Fishkov, too--already 
under arrest--in search of this kind of compromising material. 
They were interested, among other things, in one of the most 
active people on Chubays' team--Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy 
chairman of the State Committee for the Administration of State 
Property. 
  Another discovery that came out of the "Fishkov case" was 
the 
fact that the office and home telephones of the property fund's 
top officials had been wiretapped. Authorization issued by the 
supervising procurator is dated March of last year. Fishkov was 
among the persons whose telephones had been tapped. 
  There was, for instance, a recording of Fishkov's 
conversation with Aleksandr Kokh, former deputy chairman of the 
committee for the administration of city property. In response 
to Fishkov's justified argument that the property fund was not 
prepared to conduct privatization auctions and his proposal not 
to rush it, the interlocutor assures him that everything would 
be fine and insists on keeping up the pace of privatization. 
Several weeks later Fishkov would be sitting in a preliminary 
investigative detention facility on charges of negligence. 
  An important circumstance that draws one's attention is that 
if we agree with the prosecution's position, Fishkov's "criminal 
actions" began at the earliest in the summer of last year. In 
particular, the payment in foreign currency for the dacha in 
Repino--assuming it did indeed take place--happened in June, and 
the loss of the vouchers--in September. At the same time, the 
special services had by then been authorized several months 
earlier to listen in to property fund employees' telephone 
conversations. Let us point out that they have to present 
sufficient cause in order to have wiretaps authorized. In other 
words, if a certain person is under suspicion and this suspicion 
has grounds, the procurator has the right to authorize covert 
surveillance, including wiretaps. It is not known what kind of 
sufficient cause the special services had with respect to the 
property fund almost a year ago. 
  Wiretaps on Fishkov's telephones also brings up at least two 
more questions. If we assume that the disappearance of the 
vouchers from the property fund was a result of someone's 
machinations, a regular wiretap on telephone conversations 
should easily have produced an answer as to where and how the 
privatization vouchers had disappeared. However, to our best 
knowledge, the investigation does not have an answer to this 
question. In addition, according to the investigation's version, 
the transfer of foreign currency as payment for the dacha was 
done in Fishkov's office at the property fund. The subject of 
transferring such a large amount of money would inevitably have 
cropped up in private conversations. However, wiretap materials 
do not confirm this fact in any way, and the entire case against 
Fishkov under Article 88--"foreign currency dealings"--is built 
only on the testimony of the other participant in the deal--the 
seller of the dacha. 
  In an article entitled "The Roulette Wheel Stopped on Black" 
(NEVSKOYE VREMYA 8 December of last year) on the subject of the 
"Fishkov case" we looked in great detail into the circumstances 
related to the charges against Fishkov on "foreign currency 
dealings." The first item that raised questions then was why the 
charge of violating foreign currency operations had been brought 
only against Fishkov, since the law envisages the responsibility 
of both participants in a foreign currency deal. Moreover, the 
investigation has in its possession a document showing that Mr. 
K.--the dacha seller--was loaning foreign currency out with 
interest, that is, not only conducting foreign currency deals 
but also making a profit from them. No charges have been brought 
against Mr. K., however; moreover, he was not even asked to sign 
a pledge not to leave town. 
  At that time we advanced the hypothesis that Mr. K., who was 
planning to move permanently to America, would definitely leave 
Russia without waiting for Fishkov trial. Two weeks later, in 
December of last year, the main witness in the Fishkov case, Mr. 
K., indeed moved to America permanently, and there is 
practically no chance of getting him to appear at the upcoming 
trial. Most likely the court will not hear the first-hand 
testimony of this man and will have to make a ruling on this 
part of the charges exclusively on the basis of the preliminary 
investigation materials.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova and Vadim Tyagniryadno under </F>
the rubric "Elections-94": "Pilgrimage to Power"] 
  [Text] The first phase of the City Assembly election 
campaign is coming to a close. Just a few days remain until the 
deadline for registration of candidates for deputies. At 
midnight on 18 February the electoral commission will stop 
accepting signature lists from coalitions and independent 
candidates. The statute on elections envisages two methods of 
candidate nomination in majority-based 
districts--self-nomination and nomination from a public 
association. Self-nomination requires the collection of 2,000 
signatures in one of 50 districts. Electoral coalitions' task is 
somewhat easier: They need to submit 35,000 signatures, after 
which the coalition may field one candidate in each district. It 
is worth remembering that 38 coalitions have submitted 
registration applications, of which 34 have been cleared by the 
city electoral commission to participate in the election 
campaign. Not all made use of this right--realistically, 24 
coalitions have begun signature collection. Although this does 
not mean that the rest have given up on their plan to place 
their candidates in the assembly. For instance, the unregistered 
"Entrepreneurs Forum" intends to field representatives in 15 
districts. They will run in the elections as independents. Many 
candidates included in coalition lists also collect signatures 
on their own in parallel--as a fallback. And some have managed 
to get placed on the lists of several coalitions at the same 
time. 
  We are offering you a brief review of electoral coalitions 
that have begun signature collection. It is quite difficult to 
determine the political coloration of many coalitions. Of 
course, as in Elections-90, both communist and democratic blocs 
are represented. But this distinction is not as clear-cut 
today--four years ago it would have been impossible to see a 
former member of the CPSU oblast committee and a former 
Democratic Russia cochairman coexist on the same list. 
  For a considerable number of candidates this is not the 
first 
election campaign. Many have experience of working in the city 
soviet, and in the Congresses of Russian and USSR People's 
Deputies. Many participated in the recent election campaign to 
the Federal Assembly. 
<H5>  Democratic Unity of Petersburg </H5>
  The Democratic Unity of Petersburg [DUP] is the fruit of a 
pre-election accord of parties, public movements, and 
organizations of a democratic orientation, many of which are 
quite well known in the city. The bloc was set up at the 
beginning of the year by seven founders: the 
Christian-Democratic Union, the regional branch of Democratic 
Russia, the Free Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the 
Memorial human rights society, the Economic Freedom Party, and 
the Society of Russian Solidarists. 
  The DUP has brought together supporters of proceeding with 
socioeconomic reforms, and aligns itself with the 
right-of-center coalition in the State Duma, that is, Russia's 
Choice, PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], the 12 
December Union, and part of Yabloko [Yavlinskiy-Lukin-Boldyrev 
bloc]. In their platform statements bloc members emphasize 
support of entrepreneurship. 
  The DUP signature list contains 22 names; altogether, the 
coalition submitted 43 candidates to the electoral commission. 
The DUP leaders have succeeded in putting together a team that 
has an impressive abundance of well-known names of politicians, 
figures of science and culture, entrepreneurs, and 
industrialists. At the same time, the bloc's list proved quite 
diverse. The coalition is headed by A. Belyayev, member of the 
Federation Council and a former city soviet chairman. Also on 
the DUP list: N. Arzhannikov, former deputy chairman of the 
Russian Supreme Soviet human rights commission; M. Chulaki, 
writer and democratic movement activist; the famous jeweler A. 
Ananov; Baltic Plant Director Oleg Shulyakovskiy; and Igor 
Soshnikov, SvDPR [Free Democratic Party] cochairman. 
Entrepreneur Ilya Baskin also is running on the DUP slate. 
  Many DUP candidates have already had the experience of the 
pilgrimage to power in the recent past. First and foremost 13 
former city soviet deputies. Among them are Nikolay Zhuravskiy, 
former chairman of the commission on housing policy; Andrey 
Krylov, former chairman of the commission on economic reform; 
and Aleksey Reshetov, one of the leaders of the Leningrad Oblast 
farmers' movement. Also on the bloc's list are former all-Russia 
deputies Nikita and Mikhail Tolstoy. Former high-ranking 
mayoralty functionaries also vie to return to the levers of city 
administration: Yelena Drapeko, former chairman of the culture 
committee, and Vadim Kalinin, chairman of the Port-Bank board of 
directors, who came to his current job from the post of deputy 
chairman of the Committee for the Administration of State 
Property. 
<H3>  The Petersburg Branch of the Russian Creative Union of 
Cultural Workers </H3>
  The Creative Union of Cultural Workers took advantage of its 
position as nearly the only creative association that has the 
right to participate in the elections and fielded its own list 
of candidates. 
  The Creative Union runs first and foremost under the banners 
of protecting culture and defends the interests of people who 
work in this sphere. The association sees as one of its main 
tasks preservation of the city's system of cultural 
establishments--libraries, houses and palaces of culture, cinema 
theaters, etc. Most names on the registered list of 11 
candidates are heads and functionaries of various cultural, 
educational, and science establishments, who are not too well 
known to city residents. Among them are the rector of the 
Humanities University, Aleksandr Zanesotskiy; the director of 
Imeni Rerikha School, Sergey Kirpichev; and the director of 
Imeni Lensoveta House of Culture, Lyudmila Trofimova. The most 
colorful figure on the list is Aleksandr Ilyin, in the past a 
circus performer and now a well-known folk-medicine healer. Also 
nominated together with the Creative Union is Aleksey Kovalev, 
former deputy of the latest city soviet, who acquired some fame 
at the end of the 1980's through his actions in protecting 
architectural landmarks, and then actively fought the 
mayoralty's comprehensive city planning projects. 
<H5>  Independent Association `Business Petersburg' </H5>
  In addition to V. Kharchenko, president of the Union of 
Associations of Industrial, Construction, Science, 
Transportation, and Communications Enterprises, the bloc's list 
includes V. Zanin, general director of the NPO 
[scientific-industrial association] Signal; I. Konoval, general 
director of the Plastpolimer AO [joint-stock company]; V. 
Zhimirov, general director of the Almaz AO; Yu. Trusov, general 
director of the Ptitseprom AO; and V. Rudenko, director of the 
clinical center for advanced medical technologies. In the same 
list are film director V. Bortko and V. Orlov, chairman of the 
presidium of the Foundation for Aiding Residents of Blockaded 
Leningrad. (A total of 11 candidates.) "Business Petersburg" 
leaders point out that the bloc unites people who do not need to 
be taught--they have a good idea of the mechanism for solving 
city and sectoral problems. 
  "Business Petersburg" intends to bring up a score of draft 
laws at the very first session of the City Assembly. The goal is 
to make it profitable for goods producers to preserve and create 
jobs; support the population's investment in residential housing 
construction; increase the role of local taxation; and bring the 
city's credit and finance system in line with the interests of 
the population. The bloc also intends to propose a program for 
setting up enterprises for the production and sale of goods 
intended for low-income population groups. 
<H5>  The Constitutional Democrat Union of St. Petersburg </H5>
  Registered in December 1992. Its ranks are relatively 
small--about 100 members. They are mainly research associates of 
academic and other institutions. According to the union's 
leaders, they try to accept into their organization only those 
they trust completely. Neither do cadets [constitutional 
democrats] approve of chasing famous names. In addition to their 
party leader Aleksandr Kozyrev, the Union nominated Maritime 
Technical University Professor Aleksandr Fedorov, Agrobusiness 
Academy instructor Boris Gavrilov, Semen Vaykhanskiy, a leading 
research associate of the TsNII [central scientific-research 
institute] of fuel apparatuses; and other members of the science 
and technology intelligentsia. 
  The Union supports the soonest possible implementation of 
reforms, reorganization of the judiciary and law enforcement 
organs, and development of self-rule. Cadets see the main task 
of the state as ensuring the rights and freedoms of 
citizens--everything else the citizens will do for themselves. 
Overall, they consider themselves successors to the cause begun 
before the October revolution--the cause of building a law-based 
state. 
  In the event all the candidates from the Constitutional 
Democrats Unions are elected to the City Assembly, they will 
vote for changing the existing statute on the structure of 
organs of power in St. Petersburg. Cadets would like to see the 
representative body have broader powers and the restoration of 
balance of the branches.

Sergeyev Prepares for a Court Battle Against the Mayor"] 
  [Text] First Deputy Mayor Dmitriy Sergeyev is preparing 
documents to challenge in court the reprimand given to him by 
Sobchak for meeting in the mayoralty with the delegation of the 
Duma faction of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] 
headed by Zhirinovskiy, which took place while the mayor was on 
an official trip to Norway. This was announced by the deputy 
mayor's chief of staff, Vitaliy Voytsekhovskiy. 
  He also added that his boss at this point has not received 
the official paper, and it is not quite clear whether a 
reprimand had indeed been issued and in what wording. Dmitriy 
Sergeyev learned of it only from the mass media. This did not 
stop him, however, from preparing the needed documentation, 
which will be handed over to the court, in the event he does 
receive the official paper from the mayor with the wording 
quoted in the press.

<F P=106> [Report by Ilya Desyaterik: "Somehow They Found Half an </F>
Hour"] 
  [Text] A delegation of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia [LDPR] faction in the State Duma, headed by V. 
Zhirinovskiy, arrived in Petersburg yesterday. 
  Apparently, one of the purposes of this trip is preparation 
for the March elections to the City Assembly. This is how V. 
Zhirinovskiy commented at the press conference on his party's 
defeat in Petersburg during the elections to the State Duma. He 
said that with the exception of the mafia--in which he included 
scholars, jurists, artistic profession, and "bomzh" [people 
without an established place of residence]--nobody voted for 
Russia's Choice. As to other voters suitable for the LDPR, 
according to Zhirinovskiy, Petersburg does not have any. 
  The LDPR delegates delivered their request to postpone the 
elections to the Petersburg City Assembly to Dmitriy Sergeyev, 
chairman of the mayoralty committee on economic development. 
Naturally, they had gripes against the city's mayoralty as well. 
V. Zhirinovskiy told D. Sergeyev that "town governor Sobchak had 
no right to leave the city knowing that the LDPR delegation was 
coming." 
  The mayoralty committee for economic development refused to 
comment on V. Zhirinovskiy's visit. The committee's press 
service only said that the meeting with the LDPR leader had not 
been planned, but they have managed to find half an hour for it.

<F P=106> [Article by R. Mogilevskiy, general director of the </F>
Sociological Scientific Research Center Joint-Stock Company, 
under the rubric "Social Monitoring": "A Choice for Centuries?"] 
  [Text] Three-quarters of Petersburg voters would vote 
today the same way they did on 12 December. On the other hand, 7 
percent of those participating in elections today would not turn 
out altogether, and another 10 percent are not certain they 
would vote the same way. Another 7 percent of voters today would 
vote differently. 
  The greatest number of those who definitely would change 
their decision are among those who voted by party lists--4 
percent. The smallest--in federal and one-seat districts--1 
percent each. Thus, had the elections taken place today, the 
Petersburg electorate most likely would have reaffirmed its 
choice. The only questionable variable is the outcome of the 
referendum, which required a 50 percent plus one electoral 
turnout. 
  The elections are an accomplished fact, however, and now 
Russian voters may watch their doing. It appears that their 
observations do not add to their joy. In any case, in Petersburg 
only 9 percent of respondents are satisfied with the composition 
of both chambers of the parliament; only 2 percent are satisfied 
with the composition of the State Duma, and 5 percent--with that 
of the Federation Council. Those not satisfied with the 
composition of either the State Duma or the Federation Council 
comprise 45 percent, and 40 percent have no opinion. Of course, 
different groups of voters have a different idea of the 
approximate composition of the parliament chambers. It is clear, 
however, that the deputies' authority in the eyes of Petersburg 
voters is low. 
  In discussions over the past few weeks a hypothesis was 
advanced that the success of the LDPR, which received about 
[figure illegible]8 percent of the vote in Petersburg, was due 
to the fact that the candidates had been able to recruit new, 
previously passive, groups of voters. Our research does not 
support this hypothesis. Ninety-two percent are voters who after 
1990 have participated in all or almost all elections and 
referendums. So most likely a certain change in the preference 
structure is to be explained by a shift on the part of the 
electorate to different political values and social expectations. 
  Thus, on the threshold of elections to the City Assembly, 
voter preferences remain practically the same as they were 
before 12 December. The political fate of the representative 
branch in the city will be decided by a group of "familiar" 
voters, of whom more than 60 percent are women, 70 percent are 
persons over 40, about 70 percent have higher and intermediate 
vocational education, as a rule working, and more than 60 
percent are workers and office workers. The assembly composition 
will depend on whether the candidates find arguments and 
political programs that will preserve or change these people's 
choice, for, as research shows, it is hardly possible to count 
on a mass influx of new voters in March. 
  The survey was conducted by the St. Petersburg Sociological 
Scientific-Research Center by way of telephone polling. The 
sample included 1,105 respondents. The statistical error along 
controlled parameters (sex, age, and education) is within 3 
percent.

  [Text] Deputy Mayor of St. Petersburg Vyacheslav 
Shcherbakov and the city soviet's former deputy vice chairman, 
Boris Moiseyev, have been nominated by The City We Love 
coalition. 
  Moiseyev is convinced that, having received new mandates, 
candidates of The City We Love coalition will not let the 
administration rest in peace and will actively defend the 
interests of city residents. At the same time, emphasized Boris 
Aleksandrovich, we are not talking about confrontation with the 
executive branch: The previous legislative body had normal 
working relations with the mayoralty's committees, and this 
cooperation should be continued. 
  Commenting on Sobchak's decision, which bars him as deputy 
mayor from running for the Assembly, Vyacheslav Shcherbakov said 
that he will leave his job if he becomes a deputy. 
  Yuriy Boldyrev has already endorsed The City We Love 
coalition. Also announced at the press conference was a 
statement signed by Oleg Bogomolov, Stanislav Govorukhin, and 
Sergey Bogomolov, who also support the bloc's program planks. 
  Members of the Our City Is Our Home coalition also call 
themselves centrists. 
  In addition to the Liberal Club, the founders of this bloc 
include the For Justice movement, the Socialist Workers Party, 
and the Civic Democratic Movement. Among other organizations 
that have joined this bloc are two charity foundations, the 
Association of Families With Many Children, the Center for 
Medical-Economic Research, the Jurists for Ecology legal center, 
the computer programmers trade union, and other organizations. 
In the opinion of the coalition's organizers, reforms cannot be 
conducted by "fire and sword," without taking into account the 
vital interests of the majority of citizens--otherwise the 
result will be a vote for Zhirinovskiy's party. 
  In the event they are elected to the City Assembly, bloc 
candidates, in particular, intend to concentrate on issues of 
bringing the city and the oblast closer together. In the opinion 
of Sergey Andreyev, leader of the For Justice movement, for 
Petersburg residents the result will be lower prices for 
agricultural products and expanded selection of them.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Popov, senior instructor of the Technical </F>
University, candidate for City Assembly deputy: "You Fail, 
Gentlemen!"] 
  [Text] The mayoralty could not find anything better to do 
than to read on the radio to the entire city the data on each 
candidate to the City Assembly. There are a lot of 
candidates--750, and not much air time. So they give us less 
than a minute to get acquainted with each candidate. 
  Can the broadcasting network made available by the radio and 
television company be used more effectively? Of course it can. 
And the solution is right there, on the surface. It would 
suffice to broadcast in each rayon of the city only the 
information on candidates going on the ballot from this rayon. 
Then in Kalininskiy Rayon, for instance, you would only need to 
provide information about five electoral districts rather than 
50, and in Oktyabrskiy Rayon--only one. This way, air time would 
be used 10 times more effectively in Kalininskiy Rayon and 50 
times more effectively in Oktyabrskiy Rayon! 
  Is there, though, the technical capability to simultaneously 
broadcast different programs in different rayons of St. 
Petersburg? Yes, there is. In a number of rayons such 
"rayon-wide" broadcasting has been the practice once or twice a 
week for quite a while. And nothing prevented the mayoralty from 
organizing such rayon-targeted election broadcasts. 
  I think that in this rather simple matter the mayoralty uses 
the resources made available by the radio and television company 
(that is, in the final analysis, the taxpayers money) with a 
utilization coefficient of between 2 and 10 percent. 
  In any case, I usually fail my students who show this sort 
of 
productivity.

detention and subsequent arrest of Nikolay Bondarik, one of the 
leaders of the Russian Party's Petersburg branch. 
  According to Vladimir Yeremenko, the representative of the 
Russian Party and three other St. Petersburg residents detained 
together with him have not yet been charged; nevertheless, after 
the detention period (three days) expired, the procuracy found 
it necessary to formally place Bondarik under arrest. "We have 
all the grounds to bring a murder charge against him within 10 
days," said the city procurator. 
  Nikolay Bondarik and his three comrades are suspected of 
murdering one of the Russian Party members, Tsikharev, whose 
body was found in the Karpovka River in May of last year.

<F P=106> [Report by D.S.: "Counterintelligence Has Detained Bondarik"] </F>
  [Text] Last weekend, officers of the anti-terrorist 
service of the St. Petersburg administration of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS] together with officers of the 
criminal investigations department of the city administration of 
internal affairs, detained four residents of our city, among 
whom is Nikolay Bondarik, the Russian Party's branch chairman 
currently running for a deputy seat in the City Assembly on the 
slate of the Great Russia bloc. 
  As we were told in the press center of the FCS's city 
administration, the detained are suspected of committing a 
premeditated murder and, according to the city procuracy data, 
of other crimes as well. Criminal proceedings have been 
initiated, and the necessary investigation conducted. It appears 
that the detained will be formally charged in the nearest future. 
  P.S. The Great Russia electoral coalition is waiting to see 
how events develop. This was announced by the bloc's 
coordinator, Leonid Isakov. He hopes that it has all been a 
mistake and that Nikolay Bondarik will soon be free to go. At 
the same time, the bloc coordinator pointed out that Mr. 
Bondarik's arrest affects first and foremost the Russian Party 
rather than the Great Russia bloc. He also expressed hope that 
accusations against Bondarik are not related to Great Russia's 
political positions. In the opinion of representatives of the 
city electoral commission, the fact of detention and initiation 
of criminal proceedings cannot serve as grounds for barring 
Bondarik from going on the ballot for a deputy seat in the City 
Assembly.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kovalev, under the "Municipality" </F>
rubric: "The Return of People's Patrols"] 
  [Text] Deputy Mayor Vladimir Yakovlev proposed yesterday at 
the conference in Smolnyy to transfer to businessmen free of 
charge for the period of five to 10 years all flooded and 
semiflooded basements in the center of the city, of which there 
are currently about 1,200. 
  Vladimir Yakovlev also intends to attract investors from the 
business community to restoration of 180,000 square meters of 
city-owned condemned residential space on the terms of giving 
them 20 percent of the restored residential space. The mayoralty 
currently is preparing a directive on investor support for the 
reconstruction of 51 houses. The mayoralty also had plans to 
direct 56 billion rubles into reconstruction of 46 more 
buildings. No money has yet been appropriated from the budget, 
however. 
  The next urgent topic that has brought about a lively 
discussion among heads of administrations was the problem of 
property registration in the residential sphere. (According to 
information received from competent sources, 13 murders have 
been recorded in Petersburg stemming from disputes that have 
emerged during registration.) On 1 March a directive was issued 
liquidating design and inventory bureaus (DIB), which until then 
had been in charge of these matters. Anatoliy Sobchak did not 
like the fact that DIB's were commercial organizations, 
joint-stock companies, and state enterprises all at the same 
time. The mayor intends to transfer the registration function to 
the mayoralty's residential housing committee. 
  Another subject discussed at the conference in Smolnyy was 
the crime situation. A decision was made to resurrect people's 
patrols. There are currently 397 people's patrol detachments 
[PND] in the city. The mayoralty's administrative organs 
department will conduct the people's patrols training through 
its rayon branches. Meanwhile, the Smolnyy is drafting the 
procedures for remuneration of PND members. 
  Representatives of the Petersburg City Administration of 
Internal Affairs presented at the conference a report on 
combating illegal production of alcoholic beverages; they 
reported that on 27 February they uncovered at the medical 
preparations plant a "factory" that replaced the labels on Iskra 
glass cleaner with those of the Zvezda Rossii vodka trademark.

<F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Gavrilina: "`New Initiative' Is </F>
Confident"] 
  [Text] The New Initiative electoral coalition sees the main 
point that distinguishes it from other democratic blocs in that 
it was not formed on the threshold of elections, but has existed 
since a year ago, in the form of a club founded by a group of 
representatives of small and medium-sized business. Regardless 
of the outcome of the elections, the club sets for itself the 
task of defending the interests of the middle class, which is 
where 43 New Initiative candidates belong. 
  Mikhail Zhuravlev, formerly a deputy chairman of the city 
soviet commission on law and order issues, pointed out in the 
conversation with journalists the positive points in other 
blocs' programs in this respect, adding, however, that 
realization of all programs is possible only if the authority is 
free of corruption. 
  Candidate Vitaliy Skoybeda (also a former deputy) said that 
his initial reluctance to run disappeared when he looked at the 
lists of other blocs--which, in his opinion, are not overflowing 
with the intellectual elite--and he now intends to enter the 
battle for a deputy seat.

<F P=106> [Report by V. Nugmanov: "The Chairman Has Reported and </F>
Announced a Recess"] 
  [Text] The Kazan City Soviet 17th Session, which opened on 
2 March, worked literally for several hours. Of the packed 
agenda containing more than a dozen items, only the first may be 
considered settled. 
  A report on the socioeconomic and political situation in the 
capital of the republic was delivered by Kamil Iskhakov, 
chairman of the Kazan City Soviet and chief of the city 
administration. Having, after the report, answered deputies' 
questions, he announced that the session would suspend business 
until 16 March. The reason for the recess is preparation for the 
approaching elections. But was it in this case worth opening the 
session prior to 13 March at all? 
  The information communicated from the platform of the 
session 
was of interest inasmuch as it analyzed the present 
socioeconomic and political situation that has taken shape as of 
the present in Kazan and attempted in respect to certain items 
to find a way out of the difficult situation. 
  K. Iskhakov devoted a large part of his speech to problems 
of 
the defense enterprises, which are experiencing a sharp--almost 
23 percent--fall in production and a wholesale reduction in 
orders. Despite the measures that are being adopted--a number of 
fair-exhibitions with the participation of the defense 
enterprises and the enlistment on a competitive basis of the 
potential of the military-industrial complex in a solution of 
the crisis in agriculture--and despite loans obtained in 
accordance with a bill of exchange of the National Bank of the 
Republic of Tatarstan, the situation remains very difficult. But 
things have become somewhat easier for "defense" following the 
signing of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan. There has 
been a change in attitude toward the problems of our republic in 
"high" Moscow offices, and there is hope that the difficulties 
of Tatarstan's military-industrial complex will gradually be 
surmounted. 
  A whole set of most acute problems has built up in capital 
construction, public utilities, and power engineering. Despite 
the multibilllion-ruble injections, for the first time last year 
not a single key-ready preschool was handed over. The returns on 
R1 of invested capital in construction are currently only 36-39 
kopeks. The wear and tear on the service lines of the municipal 
economy has increased, and basic housing availability has 
declined, and extremely little new housing is being commissioned. 
  The privatization of industrial facilities is not justifying 
our hopes. As experience shows, the formation out of the 
enterprises of stock companies has been no panacea against the 
crisis. 
  Touching on the fulfillment of the recently adopted program 
for fighting crime, the chairman of the city soviet observed 
that approximately R1.5 billion had been invested in it already, 
that the numbers of the Kazan militia were increased in the past 
year by 1,200 persons, and that a growth of its ranks by a 
further 1,000 officers in the present year was contemplated. 
Although positive trends in the crime-solving rate has emerged, 
we expect of the law enforcement authorities more effective work. 
  Many difficulties still have to be overcome in the 
accomplishment of social tasks and an improvement in the system 
of tax collection. 
  As of today the arrears of the city budget constitute R59 
billion, and the next item after the recess will be the 
session's consideration of the question of Kazan's budget.

<F P=106> [Speech by Kamil Iskhakov, chief of the administration of </F>
the city of Kazan, at the 17th session of the City Soviet of 
People's Deputies] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  On the Socioeconomic Situation of Kazan </H5>
  Esteemed people's deputies! 
  The relative stability in the Republic of Tatarstan and its 
capital has become a fact, a phenomenon against which many 
regions of Russia are "measuring themselves." 
  But a "slice of life" from the economy shows that positive 
tendencies have been achieved in far from all spheres and, 
moreover, the picture has many contrasts. What has brought this 
about? An in-depth analysis confirms that results are achieved 
in places where an active role is assigned to the city's 
executive team. In other words, we are speaking about 
possibilities--legal and financial--of pursuing a strong 
municipal policy. 
  And, conversely, where our positions have been weak--weak 
from the standpoint of power of the authorities and instruments 
of administration--there the situation remains difficult. 
  I have in mind above all, of course, the capital's 
industrial 
sector. 
  We have always been proud of the fact that Kazan is a large 
industrial center, a city whose economy is deeply integrated 
into the economy not only of the republic, but also of the USSR, 
which is now a part of the past. And now this situation is a 
kind of heavy cross which the city has to bear. Suffice it to 
say that the financial situation [part of text missing]. 
  Searches for the most effective model for combining market 
relations with state regulation of the economy have been under 
way for a whole year. And although stability has not come to the 
industrial sector, certain positive strides cannot but be noted. 
  The results of 1993 show that the decline of industrial 
production, as predicted, has slowed somewhat, amounting to 14 
percent of the 1992 figure. This is somewhat better than in the 
republic as a whole, where the decline was 14.9 percent and for 
the Russian Federation, where it reached 16.2 percent. 
  We are very alarmed by the way 1994 has begun. According to 
the January results, industrial enterprises have allowed 
production to drop by 21.6 percent. 
  It does not help much to know that the major and 
deepest-seated reasons lie beyond our reach. They include a 
narrowing of the sales market, a sharp reduction of state 
orders, the lack of a reliable mechanism for mutual settlements, 
etc. 
  Suffice it to say that as of 1 January 1993 consumers owed 
enterprises of Kazan 304.6 billion rubles [R]. This sum is no 
more or less than about three times the monthly production 
volume. Naturally, this did not simply exacerbate the financial 
position of the enterprises, it dealt a blow to their 
capabilities. If there is nothing with which to buy raw and 
processed materials, there is no production and no final 
product. For the city this means a decrease in tax revenues. 
Such is the vicious circle. 
  Incidentally, almost half of the debt is from orders from 
the 
Government of Russia that have not been paid for. And if we 
throw in the money that has slipped out of the budget of Kazan, 
we are looking at a figure of R100 billion. With this kind of 
"makeweight," we could cover all of our shortfalls. 
  This pertains particularly to the question of why we should 
go to the Russian elections and whether we need defenders of our 
interests in the legislative assembly of Russia. As you see, we 
need them, and not so much from a political as from a pragmatic 
perspective! 
  The crisis is being felt especially strongly by "defense," 
which accounts for about half of all the fixed capital of the 
city's industry. And the record decline of production--22.7 
percent--naturally had a painful effect on the economy of the 
city as a whole. This is where we felt the full measure of what 
it means to be one of the capitals of the military-industrial 
complex! 
  The republic and the city have unilaterally tried to ease 
the 
crisis here too. They have developed the concept of structural 
transformations of the economy. We have seen the first--so far 
modest--experiment in competitive enlistment of the potential of 
the military-industrial complex to solve the problems of the 
agro-industrial complex, public health, and the construction 
complex. 
  From the fund for structural rearrangement under conditions 
of targeted preferential credit the enterprises of the city were 
allotted more than R6.7 billion in 1993. The situation was eased 
considerably by the bill of exchange from the National Bank of 
the Republic of Tatarstan, which made it possible to make 
one-fifth of the mutual settlements. It should be stipulated 
that we cannot allow ourselves the luxury of using purely 
cost-oriented mechanisms. Project and business plans of 
enterprises must meet the requirements of both economic 
expediency and the possibility of recoupment. 
  In the summer of 1993, on the initiative of the 
administration, the first trade fair, called "Entrepreneurs and 
Production," was organized in the city. Participating in it were 
84 entities of the nonstate economy. In so doing they managed to 
generalize and bring to the enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex, which were experiencing an extreme 
shortage of orders, a whole package of proposals from 
entrepreneurs of the "new wave." 
  Last week, from the 24th through [text missing] which 
received a positive response from both industrial and trade 
enterprises. Displaying their products at the exhibition were 91 
enterprises with various forms of ownership not only from the 
city but also from other regions of the CIS. For the first time, 
broad masses of the population had an opportunity to see 
peacetime products from the city's converted enterprises, since 
Kazan alone was represented by 22 enterprises and organizations 
of the defense complex. The preliminary results show that during 
the course of the exhibition, its participants scheduled the 
conclusion of about 350 agreements for a total of more than R20 
billion. About R30 million worth of goods was sold to retail 
trade. Thus, the results of the exhibition show the expediency 
of taking such measures. 
  As I have already said, all these measures were unilateral 
in 
nature. And, undoubtedly, such a counterbalance is not capable 
of halting the decline of state orders for the 
military-industrial complex, which has gathered immense speed. 
Thus, while in 1991 the Government of the Russian Federation 
reduced orders for "defense" by 22 percent, in 1993 the volume 
of the state orders here engaged less than one-fourth of the 
capabilities of our enterprises. 
  Now, after signing the agreement with Russia, we have the 
hope of a civilized solution to such collisions. The more so 
since the federal government, judging from everything, has 
followed Tatarstan to the conclusion that the course of the 
reforms in this stage require not weakening but strengthening of 
the state's role. 
  If we listen, we will hear that Moscow is starting to speak 
our language. State authority must be strengthened, and the 
economy requires control in the transition stage. But the main 
thing is that the agreement is already producing concrete, 
positive results: The federal government has begun to pay its 
debts, and the process of granting credit for conversion has 
started. Enterprise managers who have visited Moscow share the 
impression that there has been a sharp change in the attitude 
toward Kazan's initiatives, and the atmosphere in the high 
offices is fundamentally different. 
  As concerns the relatively narrow scope of the municipal 
policy, its object has been and still is to produce goods that 
are useful to the people. A careful selection of objects for 
financing, in-depth expert appraisal of business plans, strict 
control over the expenditure of target funds, and other 
instruments are gradually proving their effectiveness. Thus, the 
Tochmash Plant assimilated the output of more than 40 items in 
barely three years. During the same period, Elekon assimilated 
the output of more than 50 new items. The most promising and 
significant of them are various kinds of laser equipment and 
instruments for diagnosis and treatment of diseases in the areas 
of dentistry, cardiology, and gynecology. They have been 
supplied to the first laser center in the CIS, which was created 
on the basis of the association's polyclinic. At the present 
time the helicopter association has developed and introduced 
about 20 kinds of consumer goods. Among the latest innovations 
of the engine construction association are synchronized electric 
motors to be used for various purposes. The Terminal Association 
is producing equipment for counting banknotes, money accounting 
machines, strongboxes, computer equipment, anti-hijacking 
devices, and a broad assortment of consumer goods. In 
conjunction with the Medinstrument scientific production 
association, they are producing a mobile pneumatic drill for 
dentists. 
  As a result, 11 percent more goods have been produced with 
the trademark of the military-industrial complex than in 1992. 
True, in the city as a whole, according to the results of the 
year, the volumes of output of consumer goods has decreased by 
4.9 percent. [Text missing] the decline was twice as great. 
  The condition of the industrial "knights in shining armor," 
including the flagmen of the military-industrial complex, 
undoubtedly has a painful effect on the economy of the city as a 
whole and on its social microclimate. The downsizing of 
production leads to a reduction of the tax base and, 
consequently, to a reduction of budget capabilities. 
  All that is fair. 
  At the same time, the practice of reform forces us to pay 
more and more attention to microeconomic processes. And because 
of their nature and position, the local authorities are 
responsible for precisely the "trivia of life." 
  The picture, briefly, is as follows. The production of 
foodstuffs in 1993 as a whole increased by 11.9 percent. Here is 
the breakdown of the growth for individual groups: sausage 
items--7.8 percent, fatty cheeses--40 percent, butter--almost 
1.5-fold, and confectionery items--17.2 percent. 
  Note that this is not a decline but actually growth. And in 
the high echelons of power they have heard this assessment, 
expressed with relief: Kazan is finally working independently in 
the area of the food policy. 
  On the whole, the results of the year make it possible as a 
minimum to maintain the existing level of consumption of the 
main food products. Consequently, we need not speak about a 
crisis of the food complex. As for rumors about famine among the 
people, let these discussions remain on the conscience of failed 
politicos. 
  The agrarian sector of the republic, in which we are also 
investing a good deal, is becoming a field for studying 
experience. The Government of Russia has expressed a readiness 
to make large investments in our food complex. And here, as we 
see, the seeds of the agreement are already beginning to sprout. 
  Of course, a strong food policy comes with its own price 
tag. 
Stable provision of food products was achieved through active 
state support of the commodity producers. The budget took over 
half of the costs for increasing the fertility of the land, and 
building enterprises of the food and processing industry; there 
are still significant subsidies for grain and milk, etc., etc. 
  The money for a strong food program, naturally, does not 
grow 
on trees; it has been earned and collected, including on the 
territory of Kazan. Thus, we have every reason to say that the 
city is responding adequately to the condition of the food 
market. 
<H5>  On the Situation of the Construction Complex </H5>
  Runaway inflation, which has made long-term investments 
disadvantageous, and the state's investment policy, which is 
growing weaker and weaker--these two factors are quite enough to 
lead the construction complex to ruin. 
  And in Kazan this means 118 construction organizations and 
17 
enterprises of the construction industry, which employ more than 
33,000 people. 
  Thus, radical steps were necessary in order to preserve the 
capital's construction potential. And the basic regrouping of 
the client forces became such a turning point. Thus, while in 
1991 enterprises and departments accounted for 70 percent of the 
construction of facilities of the social sphere, and the local 
soviets--only 30 percent, and this was largely with capital of 
debtor enterprises, now the ratio has changed to exactly the 
opposite. Namely, the municipal order has grown to 70 percent. 
  And it must be noted that the solutions to all the problems 
related to the development of the city, which used to pass 
through numerous departmental channels, is now fully our 
responsibility. During January-December 1993 R77 billion in 
capital investments were made in construction of facilities of 
the social sphere. 
  It is clear that when the city administration was the main 
client, it was possible to change the ratio between facilities 
for production and nonproduction purposes in favor of the 
latter. As compared to the previous year, 1.5 times more 
accommodations for schoolchildren were introduced, polyclinic 
accommodations--4.2 times, and seating in public catering 
facilities--double. 
  At the same time, there were arrears in municipal services 
networks--by 20 percent, and trading areas--by 40 percent. 
  It must also be noted that for the first time in many years 
not a single children's preschool institution has been released 
in turnkey condition, although they are being constructed, and 
the same is true of consumer service enterprises. Little 
consolation is provided by the fact that because of the higher 
prices there has been a sharp decline in the demand for 
municipal services, and the number wishing to attend 
kindergartens is not increasing but decreasing. 
  As before, the most burning problem is housing, which is 
aggravated even more by the problem of Kazan slums. The program 
for resettlement of residents from damaged, dilapidated, and 
flooded buildings must reach the mark of releasing 500,000 
square meters of new residential space per year. 
  In 1993, of the overall volume of nonproduction capital 
investments, 57 percent was used for housing construction. The 
result was 361,300 square meters, which is 100.4 percent of the 
projection. 
  I can say unequivocally that construction workers are far 
from reaching the limit of their capabilities. One of the 
reasons lies within the complex itself. This is the poor 
effectiveness in the organization of construction. 
  In 1993 construction organizations with all forms of 
ownership introduced fixed capital valued at R41.8 billion, 
which is R64.5 billion less than the amount of capital 
investments utilized. For each ruble of invested capital, there 
are only 39 kopeks (in the republic as a whole--46 kopeks) in 
fixed capital that is introduced, while back in 1985 this 
indicator reached 82 kopeks. Thus, as compared to 1985 the 
effectiveness of the introduction of fixed capital has decreased 
by half. 
  Market mechanisms in capital construction have not yet been 
fully set in motion. As before, most of the introduction of 
facilities comes at the end of the year, the construction front 
remains extremely broad as before, and capital investments are 
being dispersed among a large number of construction projects. 
  On the other hand, one cannot but recognize that a strong 
investment policy requires full-fledged financial support from 
the client. And the city has been catastrophically short of 
money, especially recently. Thus, our debt to the construction 
workers as of today is about R24 billion. 
  Problems of finances and the budget as a whole will be 
discussed later. Here I shall limit myself to the remark that 
the administration is placing a certain amount of hope on 
housing auctions. We laid the groundwork for this new mechanism 
back in the middle of last year, when we took out credit for the 
construction of a building. Today at least two sections are 
ready for sale "on the block." 
  At the same time, there is no doubt that the proportion of 
alternative investments in housing should increase. In 
particular, individual housing construction is being 
increasingly developed. While five years ago 11,900 square 
meters were introduced, this figure has now doubled. 
  But serious problems are standing in our way here. As a 
rule, 
individual construction is done on vacant areas of urban 
settlements or in the suburbs. Thus, "mini-cities" appear, which 
have to be provided with all the necessary facilities for social 
and cultural-domestic purposes, that is, all the amenities, it 
is necessary to build roads [text missing] public health, etc. 
All this social infrastructure requires large additional 
expenditures and is one more burden that the city must take on 
itself--there is nobody else. Even cooperation with the funds of 
individual builders can provide for the construction of only an 
individual facility, and it can in no way handle the project of 
comprehensive building development. 
<H5>  On the Condition of Branches of the City Economy </H5>
  With the breakdown of the previous system of branch 
management, the disturbance of economic ties, and other changes 
in our society in recent years, there have been serious 
contradictions and disproportions, which have entailed a 
considerable increase in problems of developing branches of the 
urban economy. In order to make it easier for these branches to 
exist under market conditions, throughout 1993 the city 
administration worked to transfer all branches of the urban 
economy to municipal ownership of the city. All of the following 
have been accepted for municipal ownership: 25 public health 
facilities, 36--public education, 300--trade, 57--public 
catering, 2 sports facilities, 12 movie theaters, 8 housing and 
municipal services enterprises, and the housing supply of the 
local soviets. 
  The State Committee on the Administration of State Property 
notes that Kazan is still the only region in the republic where 
municipal ownership is fully formed. 
  The basis of the economy of any city is the reliable 
functioning and further development of its municipal services, 
which determine the degree of architectural development of the 
housing supply, the provision of water, gas, heat, the discharge 
of waste waters, etc. 
  The housing supply of Kazan as of the beginning of this year 
amounted to 16.9 million square meters. One should note, 
however, the alarming tendency toward ever-increasing wear and 
tear on the housing supply. Over 10 years the volume of capital 
repair has decreased almost threefold: from 182,000 square 
meters in 1983 to 70,000 square meters in 1993. 
  The delivery of water into the network, including for the 
population and for municipal needs, increased more rapidly than 
did the housing supply and the number of city dwellers. This, of 
course, is gratifying. Something else is alarming: Every sixth 
(!) cubic meter of purified water in 1993 was wasted, being 
reflected in the indicator "leakage." 
  Another problem of the water and sewage works, which is 
typical, incidentally, of other public works systems as well, is 
the wearing out of the water and sewage systems, which exceeds 
40 percent and is increasing every year. The city is still using 
systems that were built in the last century--35 percent of the 
water mains and 25 percent of the city sewage systems are 
completely worn out. The wearing out of mains is especially 
great in Baumanskiy Rayon, where 68 percent of the water mains 
are completely worn out. As a result, over five years the amount 
of damage has increased threefold, which, in turn, disorganizes 
the work of city transportation, causes appreciable economic 
damage, and leads to millions in expenditures on repairing them. 
  For the sake of illustration, allow me to give just one 
figure: In order to fill the gaps in 1993, Vodokanal spent R138 
million. Obviously, it is impossible to refurbish all the 
existing mains in a short period of time. So we must provide for 
control of the condition of existing collectors without 
excavation. We need new equipment--special machines with remote 
control. And among the many [text missing] this problem should 
be priority. 
  When it comes to the city's energy supply, here one can 
clearly see a course toward increasing the amount of gas used in 
households. During the past five years, street gas networks have 
been extended by 35 percent and the number of apartments 
supplied with gas has increased by 20 percent. 
  As for heating, the development of this area is somewhat 
behind schedule. The balance of heating capacities and the load 
from consumers on centralized sources is developing today with a 
deficit of heat in a number of rayons of the city, above all 
Leninskiy and Moskovskiy. The city administration has recently 
adopted a number of decisions regarding this issue, and measures 
are being taken to stabilize the situation. Unfortunately, the 
problem is exacerbated to a considerable degree by the increased 
losses of heat in the systems. During the past five years, they 
have increased by 17 percent, and consequently, reserves for 
economizing exist here too. 
  As of today almost all branches of the urban municipal 
economy are operating at a loss, requiring an annual subsidy of 
up to 40 percent of the city budget. Today the city 
administration is taking measures to adapt the branches to the 
new management conditions. Versions of an economic plan for 
their functioning in contractual relations with the city 
administration are being worked out. In order to maintain the 
necessary level of reliability of fixed capital, it envisions a 
transition to economically substantiated rates and other 
decisions. Ultimately it will be proposed that all municipal 
services get away from subsidies and earn their own money in 
keeping with the quality of their service. 
<H5>  Trade </H5>
  A most important role in the life support for the capital of 
Tatarstan is assigned to branches of trade, public catering, and 
the sphere of services. The stability of the operation of the 
aforementioned branches determines the standard of living of the 
population. 
  Despite certain difficulties of the transition period, the 
situation in the consumer market remains relatively stable, with 
a tendency toward activation. The aforementioned branches are 
actually switching to market relations. 
  An ever greater role in the activity of the branches of 
trade, public catering, and consumer services is being played by 
the nonstate sector, whose proportion of the commodity turnover 
last year amounted to about 5 percent and, according to 
predictions, will increase to 25 percent this year. Market 
relations have promoted a considerable expansion of the 
assortment of the goods offered to the consumer, but at the same 
time the growth of prices for goods and services has 
significantly limited the consumer demand of the population. 
  The situation on the food commodities market is improving 
somewhat. The supply of bread, flour, cereal, sugar, and meat 
and dairy products last year was normal, for the most part. As 
early as the second half of 1993, the city was able to abandon 
the system of norm-setting for the main kinds of foodstuffs. 
  Unfortunately, at the present time the consumer market is 
being filled to a considerable degree through purchases from 
abroad. Some directors of local enterprises that produce 
foodstuffs have already begun to complain about the domination 
of goods from overseas. But the market is the market, and its 
laws cannot be changed. Prices in the stores have come very 
close to prices in the markets, and for certain products, such 
as sugar, they are even lower on the market than in state trade. 
  Thus there has been a steady tendency toward saturating the 
market with goods, expanding their assortment, and toward the 
possibility of improving the art of service [text missing] ends 
up with more stable prices. It is intended to continue working 
in this direction. The main thing under these conditions is to 
clearly analyze the tendencies in the development of the branch, 
promptly correct mistakes and omissions, and achieve more 
complete satisfaction of the demand of the population. 
  The experience of many regions of Russia where the level of 
privatization of trade is much higher than in Tatarstan, for 
example, shows that an unregulated, "savage" market has led to 
partial elimination of self-service in trade and to 
interruptions in the sale of small and unprofitable goods 
(matches, salt, bread, and milk). 
  Hence, our task is to start in our policy not from theory, 
but from practice, from the realities of the day. 
  There is a serious lag in the republic industry for the 
production of industrial goods. Because of this, and in order to 
saturate the city consumer market, goods valued at R17.4 billion 
have been purchased outside the republic. 
  Problems of getting started, naturally, are reflected in 
prices. So far, they are still somewhat higher than, say, in 
Moscow. But when this mechanism is developed and stabilized, 
when signs of saturation or a certain surplus appear, and the 
levers of competition begin to function among producers and in 
trade--then the price mechanism will be regulated. 
  A great deal, of course, will depend on the course of the 
economic reforms in the republic. 
<H5>  On the Course of Privatization </H5>
  Privatization is an indispensable part of the process of 
creating competitive market relations during the course of the 
implementation of the economic reform. A detailed analysis of 
the state of affairs in this area of our activity will be 
presented in the report from the Committee on Management of 
Communal Property. Therefore, I shall discuss only certain 
aspects, which cannot but be noted when evaluating the 
socioeconomic and political situation. 
  As of today, what are the results of privatization in the 
city of Kazan, and what is the dynamic of this process? From the 
standpoint of numerical indicators, they do not really satisfy 
us. But something else gives us hope: We have laid a reliable 
foundation for further work. 
  During the course of privatization, we have revealed many 
problems that have demanded solutions and have naturally 
directed all of us toward increasing the efficiency of the 
operation of enterprises. What percentage of the shares should 
remain under state ownership for now, how should "gold shares" 
be introduced and where, and what should be done so that 
facilities for social and cultural purposes do not suffer? 
  The results of privatization in 1993 are practical 
experience 
whose study will enable us to avoid a number of mistakes and 
blunders in the future and also to carry out the process of 
privatization in the city more fruitfully and at accelerated 
rates. 
  By the beginning of this year, 13 industrial enterprises of 
the city had been converted to joint-stock companies. After 
January, their number had increased to 28. Among them are such 
giants as Organicheskiy Sintez, KMPO, KVPO, and others. Although 
it must be noted that the results of the production activity of 
joint-stock companies has still not produced the desired effect. 
As of 1993 the decline of production volumes at their 
enterprises amounted to 18.5 percent, which is higher than in 
the city as a whole. During January the reduction of production 
volumes at them amounted to 26.7 percent. 
  Of course, conclusions here would be premature; the 
joint-stock companies are only at the beginning of their path. 
At the same time, it is clear that the creation of joint-stock 
companies in and of itself is not [text missing]. 
  When speaking about the course of so-called small-scale 
privatization, one should note that its main areas have been the 
spheres of trade and public catering. 
  At the present time 26.9 percent of the stores turned over 
for municipal ownership have been privatized and six trade 
facilities have been sold at auction. In the sphere of public 
catering, three enterprises have been privatized and seven 
facilities have been sold at auction. Of the consumer service 
facilities, eight enterprises have been privatized, as have two 
in the sphere of municipal housing. 
  And although the rates of privatization still lag behind 
those earmarked, all the conditions for speeding this work up 
already exist. 
  We are disturbed more by another aspect of 
privatization--not 
quantitative, but qualitative. We understand quite well that the 
administrative-vertical system of administration, at least in 
the sphere of service, has run its course. But it is also 
impossible not to manage, while bearing responsibility to the 
population for assortment and for working conditions and for the 
quality of services. Still, the economic and legal levers are 
very, very weak so far. 
  Actually, it is now impossible to dissolve a leasing 
agreement or to take away a license or to force trade in what 
the population needs and where it needs it. This means that it 
is necessary to have laws on administrative liability for 
violation of the rules of trade and service and on trade and 
state trade employees. There is also a need to create a 
department for protecting the rights of the consumers, and thus 
the administrations of the city and rayons will have the 
possibility not only of controlling the process of 
privatization, but also of influencing its components in the 
interests of the population. 
  One of the most important elements of the process of 
redistribution of the property is the privatization of the 
housing fund. Preparations for this began long before the 
adoption of the law; a unified city automated information system 
was created, and it is already on-line. 
  As of 1 March 1994, in Kazan 9,522 applications had been 
submitted from citizens wishing to gain ownership of their 
apartments and 4,698 families, or 1.7 percent, have already 
become owners of housing, while more than 7,000 contracts have 
been prepared to be issued to citizens. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Issues </H5>
  One of the important areas of concern under the conditions 
of 
the transition to the market should be the attraction of foreign 
investments. We regard the activity of foreign capital in the 
city's economy as one of the factors contributing to making 
economic life more active. 
  Foreign investments may be made through granting credit, 
buying shares in enterprises of the city and real estate, and 
also through having foreign firms create their own and joint 
enterprises. 
  At this stage, foreign investments are made mainly through 
creating enterprises with foreign investments. As of today there 
are 78 of these in the city, which make up 67 percent of all the 
joint ventures of the Republic of Tatarstan. There are also 23 
representative offices of foreign firms operating in the city. 
  Active work for attracting investors to the city economy is 
continuing. Thus, for example, in order to develop a base for 
the construction industry, the creation of the Plastbau joint 
venture is now being completed. The plant opening is scheduled 
for 31 March. The enterprise's main task is to produce 
construction elements according to Italian technology for 1,000 
cottages or apartments per year. The amount of the investments 
from the foreign partners was 7,200,000 [text missing] 
  The bidding for reconstruction of the Kazan airport, which 
was summed up this past 22-23 February, resulted in a victory 
for the French firm Bouygues, which proposed the best plans and 
financial arrangements for the reconstruction work. 
Additionally, this same firm, getting its stride, is taking on 
the reconstruction of the Kazan Hotel. The project is estimated 
at $68 million, and the French are investing $54 million, or 80 
percent. 
  The example of the construction of a modern pavilion on the 
area of the VIKO [expansion not indicated] (the former VDNKh 
[Exhibition of the Achievements of the USSR National Economy]) 
is curious and instructive. The German firm was unable to return 
to the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan the credit it had 
taken out, and as a result the pavilion became our property. 
  Let us note that we have managed to invigorate foreign 
economic activity with practically no legal base, no laws, and 
being bound hand and foot. 
  But now, since the Moscow "summit," the Iron Curtain has 
been 
lifted. One of the first examples: The grand joint 
Russian-Tatarstan project has gotten off the ground--the Kazan 
Logistics Center. The TASIS (Technical Assistance to the CIS) 
Committee in Brussels has approved the program for technical 
assistance to the Russian Federation from the European Union, 
one of whose points is the plan for the creation of a logistics 
center. The next stage will be for the corresponding EU 
Commissions to hold bidding for designing the center. 
  In order to regulate the legal, organizational, and economic 
principles of foreign economic activity, the session of the 
Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan adopted the law "On 
Foreign Investments." A program for attracting foreign 
investments is being prepared at the city level, and incentive 
funds will be created for them: land, real estate, and 
financial. For those foreign financial groups that will be 
investing money in branches that are priorities to the city and 
thus contributing to solving the city's crucial problems we 
intend to grant tax and other benefits. 
<H5>  Social Policy </H5>
  Our entry into the market has generated quite a few 
previously unfamiliar problems, whose solutions require 
additional expenditures. Thus, the stratification of the society 
according to income has defined that part of the Kazan residents 
who are now faced with the problem of survival. And today we are 
all disturbed by the question of how to organize social 
protection for people who need it and make it more active. 
  Targeted protection of the population is undoubtedly the 
radical solution that practically everyone today regards as a 
complex of timely state measures capable of if not balancing out 
then at least easing the pressure of market forces. 
  In order to solve this problem, the city has created a 
unified service for social protection of the underprivileged 
strata of the population, and the organization of an information 
bank based on the official passport of the individual is in the 
stage of completion. Card files have been created of orphan 
children, disabled persons, families with many children, elderly 
couples who are living alone, participants in the cleanup after 
the disaster of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and other 
categories of the population who are in need of our increased 
attention. Today we include among them more than 115,000 Kazan 
residents to whom just last year material aid in the amount of 
R29 million was given out of the city fund for social support. 
The sum not so [text missing] of the entire complex of work 
conducted on this plane. 
  Designating 1 October as the Day of the Elderly has become a 
good tradition in the city. In spite of certain difficulties, 17 
Veteran stores are continuing to function in the city, emergency 
social assistance departments have been opened up in two rayons 
of the city, and work is being done to create a network of 
medical-social facilities. The city social rehabilitation center 
for disabled children was opened up in December 1993, and work 
is being done to create facilities to stay overnight and a 
center for comprehensive service for pensioners. 
  Questions of a stage-by-stage transition to payment for 
housing in an amount that provides for reimbursement for 
outlays, taking into account benefits for certain categories of 
the population, are in the stage of being developed. 
  The market is the market, but today we cannot let city 
dwellers go without our attention and assistance. 
<H5>  On the Condition of the Fight Against Crime </H5>
  The fight against crime remains one of the major areas in 
the 
activity of state administrative organs of the republic and 
city. The law "On Extraordinary Measures for Fighting Crime" has 
become the basis that enables us to step up our attack on crime 
even more. 
  The reinforcement of the city militia personnel is 
continuing; in 1993 it increased by 1,200 people. This year it 
is planned to introduce an additional 1,000 staff units. 
  It was proposed to the leaders of the seven largest 
enterprises of the city that they create on their territories on 
a contractual basis militia divisions for protecting the 
facilities belonging to them. These subdivisions have been 
created at the imeni Gorbunov Kazan joint-stock production 
association, the Orgsintez joint-stock company, the Polimerfoto 
plant, the KVPO, and others. 
  In order to prevent apartment burglaries during 1993, 1,636 
apartments were equipped with burglar alarm devices. 
  Proposals for financing and additional material and 
technical 
support for all rayon internal affairs administrations and the 
internal affairs administration of the city of Kazan were taken 
into account when compiling the budgets for 1993-1994. For 
financing the municipal militia and measures of the "Complex of 
Immediate Measures for Fighting Crime in the City of Kazan 
During 1993-1995" during the report year, R1.4784 billion was 
allotted from the budget of the city of Kazan, including for 
financing the program--R841.3 million. From the city budget, 
R840 million was allocated for acquiring automotive 
transportation, supplies, and equipment for the Patrul-Kazan ASU 
[automated control system]. 
  The main thing that law enforcement organs have gained is 
confidence in their forces; they are filled with resolve to curb 
the flow of crime, which has threatened to become uncontrollable. 
  According to the results of 1993, the solution of crimes has 
risen from 53.9 to 63.8 percent. The courts received 3,314 cases 
more than in 1992, and this is very important. 
  People regard the work of law enforcement organs primarily 
from the standpoint of the inevitability of punishment, and we 
must do everything possible. 
<H5>  On Execution of the Consolidated Budget </H5>
  The city budget is becoming a basic and ever more decisive 
instrument of our socioeconomic policy. Today I could not name a 
single municipal problem that could not be solved if we had 
enough monetary resources. 
  The year 1993 was marked by exertion of all forces to 
mobilize incomes. Tax, financial, inspection, law enforcement 
[text missing] rayon administrations for the first time 
collected R245.5 billion in revenues on the territory, 55.7 
percent or R137 billion of which, in keeping with existing 
normatives, went into the city budget. 
  The over-fulfillment of the revenue part of the budget 
amounted to R89 billion (or 265 percent). 
  At the same time, because of price factors and other 
well-known reasons, budget expenditures have grown at even more 
rapid rates. In essence, the city administration has come up 
against the problem of choosing to cancel certain municipal 
orders or continuing to work while increasing municipal debts. 
  I can say definitely that the latter path was chosen, 
because 
otherwise it would have been impossible to avoid the threat of 
the collapse of such a complex as the construction complex and 
services so necessary to the city such as the association for 
urban planning. This is why the city's carryover budget 
indebtedness for 1993 for the various branches of the municipal 
economy amounted to more than R28 billion. 
  The system of strict financial discipline I have introduced, 
which presupposes strictly specified expenditure of funds, 
pushes us toward the objective inevitability of such a factor as 
indexation. 
  Compare. Unprecedented amounts have been spent on capital 
repair and current maintenance of roads and other facilities for 
outside urban development--R16.2 billion. As a result, 1.718 
million square meters of roads and sidewalks have been repaired. 
And almost the same amount--R15 billion--was spent to increase 
the wages of workers in the social-cultural sphere. 
  For the development of housing and municipal services 
enterprises, R25.1 billion were allotted from the budget; for 
capital repair of the housing supply and landscaping the areas 
around buildings--R3 billion. At the same time, because of the 
application of regulated rates, housing and municipal services 
enterprises were allotted R19 billion just in the form of 
reimbursement. 
  Analysis shows the city's need for funds for indexation of 
expenditures amounted to R170 billion during the year. Republic 
organs reimbursed the Kazan budget for only a small proportion 
of the funds--no more than 15 percent. As a result, practically 
all of the extra revenues collected--more than R80 billion--went 
precisely for indexing expenditures and increasing wages. 
  Work done for capital construction (a large part of which is 
free housing) cost the budget R50.5 billion. On compensation for 
housing construction collectives, R2.6 billion was spent. 
  Such is the price, in the first place, of inflation, and, in 
the second place, of a socially oriented economy. 
  In addition to this, the city budget was formed and executed 
far beyond its capabilities. 
  At the same time, it is possible arbitrarily to separate the 
problems that are within our reach from those that are 
completely beyond our capabilities. 
  The payment discipline of the departments remains one of the 
most crucial problems. According to data for 1 March of this 
year, the arrears on one of the leading taxes--on 
profit--amounted to more than R4 billion for the city. 
  The second most important is the income tax from citizens. 
The steady increase in the untaxed minimum wage--generally a 
good thing--leads to a narrowing of the base of this tax. 
Moreover, the decline of production, or rather, its 
consequences, have a negative effect, as do the reduction of the 
staffs and the work week, forced administrative leaves, etc. 
  In a word, the income tax is shrinking like shagreen 
leather. 
  Against this background it is quite [text missing] negligent 
attitude toward the budget and financial discipline. 
  Unsatisfactory supervision on the part of the 
Gorelektrotransport association led to a reduction of the volume 
of paid transportation. It transported 25 percent fewer paying 
passengers than last year and failed to receive a total of R138 
million in revenues. 
  The production association Kazgorzhilkhoz is not taking the 
proper measures to reduce defaulted indebtedness on apartment 
rent and municipal services. As of 1 January 1994, this amounted 
to R35.8 million or 22.7 percent of the monthly amount. 
Defaulted indebtedness is especially great in Baumanskiy (40.1 
percent) and Vakhitovskiy (35.5 percent) rayons. 
  As a result of reducing the volumes of bathing services by 
25.4 percent and laundry services by 12.2 percent as compared to 
the corresponding period of last year, the Kombytservis leasing 
association failed to receive R88.6 million in revenues. 
  Inspections conducted by financial organs of the city 
established cases of unauthorized use of funds allotted from the 
budget for the development of housing and municipal services 
amounting to an overall sum of R34 million. 
  Under the conditions of the transition of the city economy 
to 
market relations and the critical shortage of financial 
resources for solving the city's problems, questions of local 
taxation become crucial. Local taxes are still an unutilized 
reserve for Kazan. In essence, in a situation with a critical 
budget deficit, we have indulged in an impermissible luxury by 
introducing only 12 local taxes and fees of the 20 that are 
envisioned by legislation. 
  The mistake that was made must be rectified here. In this 
hall, at this session. The more so since the situation has 
become even more severe. The financial organs--federal and 
republic--henceforth will regard local taxes as reserves that 
have not been taken into account and will predict them in the 
revenue part of the city budget. And, in particular, all of our 
appeals "to above" with one or another financial initiative will 
be rejected, referring to the seven unutilized sources. 
  Actually, local taxes and fees make up a relatively small 
proportion. Their essence lies elsewhere; everyone must learn to 
live within their means and fill the treasury from their own 
sources.

<F P=106> [Article by T. Roshchina: "Mayor of Vladivostok Seeks </F>
Revenge, Creates Own Party"] 
  [Text] "Party," it is a word, of course, spoken 
emphatically. However, in this case it may simply represent a 
public organization of V. Cherepkov supporters which opposes the 
kray's "corrupt Communist groups" in power headed by Ye. 
Nazdratenko. All of the new organization's verbal and written 
efforts indicate that the latter is so. 
  The decision by "Cherepkovians" to form the new group was 
made at the last meeting held between the mayor and the 
community in the "Gray House" on January 15th. 
  After lengthy debate those gathered elected a presidium of 
active members and approved a name for the organization, 
"Assotsiatsiya izbirateley [Association of Voters]." The name, 
in the opinion of those who spoke, reflects the organization's 
democratic atmosphere and its open membership not only for the 
citizens of Vladivostok, but for those in the kray, and in any 
other political party or association. 
  The primary task of the organization at present is to strive 
to win in the upcoming elections to the kray Duma. In doing so, 
the group hopes to gain a significant number, if not a majority 
of seats so as to present a serious legislative counterbalance 
to the kray executive power. 
  We have lost some elections, stated V. Cherepkov, and won 
some too, like Zhirinovskiy and Nazdratenko. We cannot waste 
time. Today candidates were selected from other representative 
bodies that will finance the elections for them. They are 
already being instructed on how to present themselves in public 
and how to appeal to the voters. Therefore, we must act in an 
organized fashion, not haphazardly. 
  As far as financing for the new organization is concerned, 
Cherepkov noted that an account already exists, into which money 
is being deposited in his support. He said that it is his desire 
to transfer the account over to the Assotsiatsiya izbirateley 
[Association of Voters]. 
  Judging by all appearances, the organization's first step 
will be to submit a whole package of demands to various 
authorities, starting with the President and ending with the 
local SMIP [mass information and propaganda media]. From the 
president the organization is demanding the reinstatement of its 
former representative in the kray, V. Butov; from SMIP, the 
publication of a list of people who prepared the order leading 
to Butov's removal. The association is also demanding two hours 
a week of radio broadcast time from the Primorskaya 
teleradiokompaniya, and one hour a week of television time: like 
the governor, the mayor also wants his own "Mayor's Hour." 
  A demand was also made to put PKTV back on the air, and yes, 
this time without specifying to whom the demand was being 
addressed. While on its crusade to capture the mass media, it 
has not been beyond the association to utilize the services of 
even KRASNOYE ZNAMYA, which is not well liked by the 
organization. The mayor stated, for example, that "if we are not 
allotted at least one release a week for publishing our 
association's material, it will be necessary to pose the 
question of cutting off KRASNOYE ZNAMYA's financing at the 
taxpayers' expense." 
  Cherepkov also mentioned intentions to create yet another 
new 
newspaper (apparently at the expense the city administration), 
which will tentatively be called "Golos naroda [Voice of the 
People]," and will reflect the opinions of the voters. 
  For those who are curious: the association's meetings, which 
V. Cherepkov's will participate in - and for whom they will 
simultaneously serve as meetings with the community - will be 
conducted on Saturdays at 14:00 hours in the city administration 
building.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Oshchenko: "Energy Crisis Remains Trump Card </F>
in Political Dealings"] 
  [Text] On Friday Acting Kray Administration Head 
Valentin Dubinin, Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov, and Yuriy 
Ivanov, chief engineer of "Dalenergo," held a joint press 
conference together with directors of large industrial 
enterprises concerning the situation in the Primorye [Maritime 
Territory] power industry. 
  In his introductory statements, Kray Vice-Governor Valentin 
Dubinin noted that the situation continues to be extremely 
complicated. By Friday there were 532,000 tonnes of coal in the 
kray's coal yards, whereas on the same day last year there were 
1,191,000 tonnes. 
  Valentin Dubinin said that a sum of 35 billion rubles, which 
was finally allocated by the government in the form of subsidies 
following the persistent appeals of Kray Governor Nazdratenko 
and "Dalenergo" Director Basharov, was already on its way to its 
destination, the coal workers of Siberia. 
  At the press conference, however, a shocking statement was 
heard to the effect that the 35 billion-ruble boost would only 
make it possible for the kray's power system to operate normally 
for a maximum of 20 days. Meanwhile, a statement issued by 
Yevgeniy Nazdratenko from Moscow, disseminated last week by the 
kray administration's press service, said that the billions 
procured by the governor would make it possible for Primorye 
[Maritime Territory] residents to make it through the winter in 
warmth. 
  Nevertheless, "Dalenergo" chief engineer Yuriy Ivanov was 
not 
thinking of political gain, but was being straightforward when 
he said that in the near future it would be necessary to reduce 
energy consumption by another 3.5 million kw/hr. As you will 
recall, the industrial enterprises that shut down last week 
reduced energy consumption by 3 million kw/hr. According to 
Ivanov, in Vladivostok alone there were more than 60 such 
enterprises. 
  Ivanov stated that in the coming days the electric power 
station may begin using coal right off the trucks: only coal 
transported from the open pits will be burned. This will mean, 
said the "Dalenergo" chief engineer, that heat and light will 
shut off in residential districts not according to a schedule 
for an hour of day, but for 6 - 12 hours, and possibly with no 
forewarning. If "Dalenergo" does not receive funds to cover its 
indebtedness from kray enterprises, to include those which 
belong to the Vladivostok municipality, then "in 10 days our 
time will run out," Ivanov said. 
  As was explained during the conference, the notorious 35 
billion rubles was for coal that had already been burned in the 
electric power station's furnaces in January. After that coal 
for Primorye will once again be on credit. 
  Vladivostok mayor Viktor Cherepkov said that the policy of 
procuring subsidies in Moscow was short-sighted. In the mayor's 
opinion, these billions would exacerbate, not reduce the problem 
of indebtedness. Viktor Cherepkov also expressed doubts that 
Vladivostok, which collects almost half of all taxes in the 
kray, had a budget deficit, thus signifying planned deficit 
spending on the part of municipal enterprises, to include 
PZhETs, enterprises that are part of the heat network, and so on. 
  Meanwhile the "Dalenergo" chief engineer commented on the 
mayor's statements saying: Such claims would be justified in a 
situation that was the least bit normal, but not at all under 
the emergency circumstances that exists today. 
  A VLADIVOSTOK correspondent questioned Cherepkov regarding 
reports on local television about a statement he supposedly made 
to the ITAR-TASS agency, alleging that there is a large store of 
coal in Primorye, and that subsidies were procured from Moscow 
only to be given to "mafioso structures." In response, Viktor 
Cherepkov stated it was necessary to address such questions not 
at him, but at the organization disseminating such reports. At 
the same time he stressed that the kray's coal fields were more 
than adequate, but that funds had not been invested in their 
development, and that the kray's coal industry was dying. 
  "Dalzavod" Chief Engineer Viktor Kalinichenko summed up the 
contradiction in opinions well when he said that once again the 
energy crisis is being used like a playing card in the political 
aims of the opposing sides, the kray and city administrations. 
In his opinion, it is necessary to find a compromise at all 
costs. A situation in which tens of thousands of people are 
essentially out of work, enterprises have come to a standstill, 
and housing construction has once again started simply does not 
allow for political intrigue.

POSTFAKTUM, under the rubric "Details": "Power Loves To Be 
Alone"] 
  [Text] In a recent issue NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA 
reported the strange situation that now exists in Maritime Kray 
in connection with criminal proceedings initiated on bribery 
charges against Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov. Our 
newspaper has learned some details related to the case. 
  According to information from the investigative organs, on 
10 
February citizen Volkov, who represents the movement for the 
support of Afghan veterans, informed the Vladivostok procurator 
that he had bribed some city administration officials, including 
the mayor, for allowing him to acquire a plot of land. 
  Several cars stopped by the mayor's office at about 2200 on 
Friday; they unloaded the city procurator and some 15 militiamen 
armed with automatic rifles. After the entrance was surrounded, 
the procurator and some of the militiamen went up to the 10th 
floor, to the office of Viktor Cherepkov, mayor of Vladivostok. 
They presented Cherepkov with a warrant and started their 
search, which went on until 0300. In the office of the city 
administration head they discovered 6 million rubles and $3,000; 
almost 1.5 million (in 50,000 notes) were lying in a tight roll 
behind the safe. 
  Right after this, two carloads of militia escorted Cherepkov 
to the city procuracy where he was interrogated by investigator 
Aleksandr Vysotskiy. However, he was questioned as a witness and 
not as a defendant. The accusation of bribe extortion was 
brought against some Vladivostok administration officials whose 
names are not being made public because of the investigation; at 
the same time, there is no special secrecy about them. Among 
others, there is talk about seven employees of the city 
municipal property office and the construction and architecture 
office. Their offices were searched simultaneously with the 
mayor's. 
  During the same evening officers of the kray Internal 
Affairs 
Administration [UVD] searched the city mayor's home. The search 
was caused by the fact that the night before, two people 
suspected of burglarizing Vladivostok school 74 (the crime was 
committed in May of last year) confessed and also testified that 
the mayor's son, Vladimir Cherepkov, had also taken part in the 
crime. The search of the mayor's apartment produced one of the 
computers stolen during the school burglary. The computer was 
confiscated. Vladimir Cherepkov, 19, a cadet at the Pacific 
Higher Naval School, was put in a temporary detention cell. 
  From one hour to the next the events increasingly acquired 
the character of a mystery novel. On Saturday night the militia 
received a report that six strangers had kidnapped the 
4-year-old son of the UVD female officer investigating the case 
of Cherepkov junior. The deputy commander of the kray UVD, Yuriy 
Orlenko, said that according to militia information, "a certain 
mafia group is behind the Cherepkovs." Orlenko added also that 
the office of Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, the kray governor, had 
received a telephone threat to his son; after that, instructions 
were issued to strengthen the security unit guarding his family, 
in spite of the governor's objections. 
  However, the child was returned home on Sunday. It 
transpired 
that the kidnapping had been organized by the investigator's 
live-in partner who, under the influence of alcohol, had asked 
some people he was drinking with to do him this small favor. The 
kidnappers are being sought. 
  After the nightly events, a press conference took place in 
the office of Cherepkov senior in which he denied all the 
accusations directed at him and said that the actions of the law 
enforcement organs were designed to discredit him as a city 
official. He also qualified the event as a "coup d'etat" 
initiated by the top kray administrators. However, Primorye 
Governor Ye. Nazdratenko viewed the mayor's description of 
events as an attempt to justify himself before the public and 
gain political capital. 
  The origin of the money found in the mayor's office during 
the search remains unclear. In his Saturday interview to the 
local TV and radio company, Cherepkov said that the money found 
behind the safe had been planted. 
  Local commentators view the Vladivostok scandal as a major 
achievement of the opposition represented by the mayor and his 
supporters as they anticipate the elections to the kray duma. 
Cherepkov is a former officer, an instructor at a military 
school, a deputy to the kray soviet who was the first to inform 
the world about the mayhem reigning in the military units 
deployed on the island of Russkiy; he rode the crest of his 
public success to victory in the first democratic elections to 
the Vladivostok mayor's office in the summer of 1993. But at 
this point he was losing popularity--slowly but surely--because 
of his not very successful experiments in the areas of city 
management and staffing policy. 
  Besides, the new leaders of the kray center failed to 
established good relations, to put it mildly, with the kray 
power concentrated in the hands of a team of administrators 
headed by Governor Ye. Nazdratenko, who formed his cabinet just 
a little earlier than the summer mayoral elections. 
  Today, however, with the polarization of public opinion 
growing stronger, Cherepkov's rating has jumped up and the 
chances of the "pro-Cherepkov" opposition winning at the coming 
elections to the kray duma have sharply improved; its victory 
would initiate changes in the political lineup.

POSTFAKTUM, under the rubric "Details": "Did the Vladivostok 
Mayor Take Bribes?"] 
  [Text] The Vladivostok conflict related to the 
criminal accusations against Mayor Viktor Cherepkov, already 
covered by NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA, continues to 
develop. 
  On 15 February Vladivostok's Leninskiy Rayon court was 
supposed to hear the civil suit brought by head of the Maritime 
Internal Affairs administration [UVD], Colonel Vladimir Ipatov, 
against city administration head Viktor Cherepkov. The colonel 
demanded that the mayor pay him 10 million rubles in moral 
damages caused by the fact that the mayor had damaged his honor 
and dignity when he publicly stated at a press conference that 
the Maritime militia was corrupt and that they had to fight 
crime within the militia itself. 
  Meanwhile, according to an official statement of the 
Vladivostok administration press service, the mayor's office had 
some documents at its disposal which could support Cherepkov's 
claim, and the office was ready to present these papers in court 
on 15 February. However, due to the request of the plaintiff 
Colonel Ipatov, the hearing was postponed until March. 
  The previous NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA articles described 
the position of the kray UVD that its deputy commander was 
convinced of "a certain mafia group being behind the 
Cherepkovs." We would like to remind you that a computer stolen 
from a Vladivostok school last year was found in Cherepkov's 
apartment during a search. This served as the reason for the 
arrest of the mayor's son, 19-year-old Vladimir Cherepkov, a 
cadet at the Pacific Higher Naval School, who is a suspect in 
this burglary case. 
  Cherepkov insists that the search in the administration 
building, which took place on the morning of 12 February, was 
conducted by the procuracy and militia with the purpose of 
removing any documents supporting the mayor's accusations of 
corruption against the militia. The militiamen, however, failed 
to find the papers during the search; evidently someone had 
managed to hide them. The mayor's press service says that it is 
prepared to produce the documents for the mass media. 
  On 16 February, Cherepkov senior's lawyer, S. Ulitskiy, made 
a statement in which he cast doubts on the objectivity of the 
kray procurator, Valeriy Vasilenko. Among other things Ulitskiy 
said that, during his appearance on Maritime TV on 14 February, 
Procurator Vasilenko promised to be objective when considering 
all complaints about any violations in the case of Viktor 
Ivanovich Cherepkov. But the very next day, in an interview 
published in the VLADIVOSTOK newspaper, the procurator said: "In 
an ordinary situation he would already been put away, were he 
not Cherepkov! With the proof we've got, he would be behind bars 
by now..." 
  Therefore, Cherepkov's lawyer thinks that the kray 
procurator, whose job it is to provide control over proper 
enforcement of the law and to display special objectivity, 
declared him guilty beforehand and declared the necessity of his 
detention (not only before trial but even before officially 
charging him with anything). 
  The lawyer considers that in his actions the procurator is 
violating part 1 of Article 49 of the new Russian Constitution, 
which stipulates that every person is presumed innocent until 
proven guilty according to the regulations set by federal law 
and finalized by a sentence that is legally enforced. 
  Under such circumstances, thinks defense lawyer Ulitskiy, 
Vasilenko cannot supervise the investigation of Cherepkov's 
case. Neither can this be done by any other procuracy officials 
of Maritime Kray, as they are subordinate to Vasilenko. 
  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA promises to inform its readers 
on 
the further development of events. It is possible that in the 
near future more details will come to light in the case of 
Cherepkov junior, who is in detention now, as well as in the 
kidnapping case of the 4-year-old son of investigator Irina 
Monakova, who is working on the mayor's son's case. According to 
the inquest data, the boy was kidnapped and later returned by 
Monakova's live-in partner, who had asked six of his buddies to 
act as the kidnappers. However strange it may seem, the 
investigating officers still do not know their names. Lack of 
clarity continues to haunt the further investigation of the 
bribery charges extended against the mayor and other Vladivostok 
administration officials. 
  Meanwhile, the price of stocks of several enterprises are 
plummeting at Vladivostok international stock exchanges. The 
same happened at exchanges in April of 1993 after Aleksandr 
Rutskoy's speech at a parliament session in which he spoke about 
corruption and abuse of power in the course of the Maritime Kray 
privatization process.

<F P=106> [Article by Lyubov Latypova: "In the Corridors of Power: </F>
Democracy Without Force, or Force Without Democracy"] 
  [Text] It is useful on the threshold of another special 
election to give some thought to what it will lead to regardless 
of established and declared objectives. As the previous one 
showed, the result of recurrent rearrangements in the Federal 
Assembly can diverge far from the intentions of the ideologues. 
In this regard, life supplied our neighbors in Vladivostok with 
an amazing experiment a year ago. The first results are already 
also visible... 
  As we recall, the heads of the kray and the city 
administrations were replaced practically at one and the same 
time within about a month of each other. Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, 
manager of the Vostok mining company, became governor, and 
Viktor Cherepkov, a military prosecutor, became mayor. Almost 
all the deputies of the kray board, with an assist from the 
president, voted for Nazdratenko, while a majority of the 33 
percent of the voters who came, as is customary to say, to the 
ballot boxes, voted for Cherepkov. The first "bought" the kray 
parliament with the fact that he had created a bright future 
within the scope of his own enterprise, which had grown from a 
small artel; the second made a name for himself in exposing 
improper dealings in the army, and was almost the only one of 
all of the candidates during the election campaign who promised 
with army resoluteness unconditional protection for all those 
who are orphaned or impoverished. 
  As a result, both aspirants proceeded from different poles; 
however, their new life started, and is continuing, in the same 
vein--with scandals. Cherepkov introduced free travel on public 
transport (after which it began to operate significantly worse), 
and hampered city preparations for winter, understanding nothing 
about city administration but continuously and personally 
issuing instructions. As may be realized, because of this things 
only became worse for the orphaned and impoverished. 
  Somewhat bigger scandals are tied to Nazdratenko's name. 
Quite recently Valeriy Butov, the president's representative 
(now already a former representative), accused him and the 
administration team of corruption, after which he was dismissed 
from his position without any explanation of the reason. This 
opinion, incidentally, is also shared by almost the entire 
press, which this team tried to take in hand almost immediately 
after coming to power. Almost all, with the exception of the 
KRASNOYE ZNAMYA newspaper, whose editor, Vladimir Shkrabov, 
began to manage the press committee in the executive branch. 
  The press defended its independence, continuing with a 
passion to keep an eye on the actions of an almost completely 
renewed administration. There was indeed something to keep an 
eye on: Almost all the those who came to the highest building in 
Vladivostok were people of the same team, called PAKT--Maritime 
Joint-Stock Corporation of Commodity Producers. And herein is 
the main plot. 
  Despite the fact that the representative authority was "for" 
Nazdratenko, the managers of the executive authority did not 
stand too much on ceremony with colleagues from the very 
beginning, forgetting to coordinate the candidacies being 
appointed to responsible positions with the approval of the 
council of people's deputies. At one press conference Dmitriy 
Grigorovich, chairman of the council of people's deputies, 
reported that the deputy head of administration, Igor 
Lebedinets, "told him point blank in the presence of several 
people that PAKT--new, rich people--had come to power. The 
placement of personnel was calculated a long time ago, and it is 
not necessary to impede this association." Actually, key 
positions in the "governorship" were occupied by members of this 
organization. 
  A clamor was raised about this just before the confirmation 
of Nazdratenko as the head of the administration, although the 
association itself, of which he was a founder, was formed a year 
earlier. Well, it was organized and organized--colleagues right 
away named six such organizations, and this, I think, is not 
all. The directors of the largest enterprises gathered, along 
with some of the main specialists and "necessary" people, about 
200 of them, and established a joint-stock company of the closed 
type, with a charter capital of more than R400 million, which 
even in the yardstick of the year before last was not too much. 
But this is not prohibited by law. The shares of stock were 
divided up--50 for the directors and those most "necessary" 
(including Shkrabov), and further, according to one's place in 
the hierarchy. This is also legal. Although there is a question: 
If the director of a large enterprise that is still a state 
enterprise has a maximum number of shares of stock in another, 
private structure, which one will he be more interested in? Or 
will he try to combine both interests, using the state capital 
(or former state capital) for personal aims? 
  THE QUESTION IS FAR FROM AN IDLE ONE, for--I especially 
emphasize this fact--PAKT is an association of physical and not 
juridical persons, which the enterprises headed by these 
physical persons are. That is, friendship is one thing, money 
quite another. And from this standpoint the charter capital of 
PAKT would be insufficient for the organization of the slightest 
serious business that some have proclaimed: the production and 
sale of consumer goods, the construction of industrial 
enterprises, stores, and housing, and furthermore, like 
everyone, mediation and commerce. 
  Perhaps what is most intriguing in this situation is the 
fact 
that the founders themselves, it seems, forgot about the status 
of their association and in numerous interviews enthusiastically 
drew a picture of how remarkably shareholders will begin to live 
in the very near future, while at the same time naming 
collectives that did not have a single share. As could have been 
expected, not one of these promises came to fruition, and 
enterprises, among which there were a lot of defense 
enterprises, felt the full effects--many had come to a 
standstill by winter. 
  Lawyers and economists with whom I have had occasion to 
consult regarding the promises and the deliberate silence assert 
with one voice that no law was broken here either, because 
silence is not a crime, and numerous methods for getting hold of 
a large piece of state property can be implemented in a quite 
civilized way: For example, transfer in trust to PAKT shares of 
enterprises that belong to the founders, or sell them to it 
(that is, to itself), or convert them to PAKT shares. But if it 
also takes the share that belongs to the state into trust 
control, this will be quite enough for possessing a controlling 
block of shares of the "dependent" enterprises. That is, they 
will first and foremost feed the founder-directors of the 
private structure. 
  It was assumed that the directors, tied by a single 
corporate 
string, would be able to help each other to be strong and rich 
and work out a single policy that would be profitable for 
everyone. That is, they would not beat their heads against a 
wall, bruise each other, and go to Moscow with outstretched 
hand. However, Nazdratenko's first visit was exactly with such 
an "outstretched hand" for privileges in the power industry. One 
of PAKT's founders, Vladimir Kolesnichenko, declared in this 
regard that this was the will of the industrialists of the kray. 
But in the project of the "functionally organizationally 
integrated structure to which it is planned to transfer PAKT 
smoothly, it is envisioned bringing onto the board of directors 
a special representative of the government who is to be assigned 
special rights. Although this is prohibited by law. But this is 
today's law. However, inasmuch as legislation in our country is 
extremely unstable and does not depend as much on objectives 
that generally no one sees as on the political prejudices of a 
majority of parliamentarians, it is not ruled out that the 
current majority (especially in the Federation Council, which 
consists of more than half of the governors) will change this 
situation. PAKT plans to press both the legislative and 
executive and the coordination structures, proposing "the 
inclusion of the corporation as an official structure in the 
resolution of federal programs of the government within the 
scope of implementation of programs of structural 
reorganizations in the economy of Maritime Kray and the Far 
East." That is, as long as you, local authorities, are sorting 
things out between yourselves and are dividing the chairs in the 
association of economic cooperation, we, the private structure, 
will seize the initiative and the finances. If it is also 
considered that the federal program in all variants envisions an 
exclusively colonizing policy with respect to the region, then 
it becomes somewhat awful. 
  Is it bad? Well, it depends on how you look at it... It is 
quite clear that the current authority in the region is not an 
authority in the full sense of this word, because it does not 
have the resources, does not have new levers of control at a 
time when the old ones are stuck, and does not have 
organizational support in the active strata of the population. 
The attempts by Viktor Ishayev, administration head of our kray, 
to gather intellects around himself are rather fruitless. All 
kinds of public consultative councils that clustered around him 
two years ago in the hope of dictating conditions have collapsed 
and cracked; the board of directors, enjoying his support, 
regularly composes petitions with ultimatums for the center, to 
which the center does not pay much attention; the monthly 
collegiums, like two peas in a pod, began to resemble the former 
party administrative aktivs with efforts by subordinates to 
render account successfully and by the "bosses" to lead everyone 
to clear water. Given this layout, a managerial construct is 
sooner possible as an exception than as a system. 
  But the director corps in Primorye, which is already 
reinforced with its own powerful productive forces and material 
valuables, declared unequivocally that it is tired of playing 
politics and that it is taking authority into its own hands. 
Which it is doing rather persistently, without reflecting on the 
losses of socialist morality and ethics. Perhaps this is a kind 
of revenge for the years of humiliation since the beginning of 
perestroyka, when the entire director corps was considered 
stupid and reactionary and when the idols of the public were 
speakers who called for "rejection of the old world." Is the new 
morality of society that is growing on the ruins of the old 
maturing, or is this really a degradation of ethics? I will not 
try to answer this question unequivocally, because it is in an 
equal degree unethical to muddle heads with promises of 
prosperity at the expense of the state and to build personal 
welfare on the bones of others. But we should not flatter 
ourselves regarding the independence of the Primorye governor 
from the people who make up his circle, which it would seem is 
indicated by his formal withdrawal from PAKT. Indeed, on this 
score, he also did not leave any illusions, unambiguously 
declaring after his confirmation: "I am in no measure against 
anyone from the former people, but I listen to the opinion of 
those people who are around me." 
  One can ride for a long time on the seesaw of doubts between 
two assessments of what happened--its nontriviality prompts one 
to reflect. However, there should be no doubt that this is the 
obvious beginning of the crystallization of new structures for 
which, in contrast to our numerous and weak parties, authority 
is necessary to protect their own property interests. 
Incidentally, it is said that similar structures, but with a 
clearly expressed criminal nature, also supported one of 
Cherepkov's rivals. But the new entrepreneurs of various shades, 
who also have something to gain and lose, have not yet had their 
say. Without a doubt all of them will try to establish their own 
lobbies in the representative organs of authority at the kray 
and city level. 
  In addition, two things are clearly coming into focus: 
First, 
the personal qualities of the workers who have been promoted to 
administrative posts in these structures will have secondary 
significance, inasmuch as the pyramid here has been inverted: It 
is not the leader who directs the people, but the corporation 
that directs its protege. On the one hand, this means that we 
will never again be ruled by either tyrants or musical comedy 
personalities. On the other hand, are the corporate interests of 
a rather narrow circle of persons that much better? 
  It is a short step from here to another circumstance If 
anyone still has any illusions that authority serves everyone, 
let them be finally dispelled, because this never happened, 
either in capitalist or in socialist times. It is another matter 
that perhaps tall weeds grow out of nothing and that it is 
impossible to make everyone happy at the expense of the poor, 
but owing to an increase in wealth it is possible to make many 
happy. Depending on the kind of goal one sets and how to reach 
it. But I will not throw myself now into a slough of doubts 
regarding the goals and methods of achieving them. I will stand 
aside and think about something else. 
  I will think about Viktor Ivanovich Cherepkov who, without a 
doubt, evokes deep respect for his tireless courage in exposing 
vices and, at best, pity--for incompetence in creative matters 
behind which there are no real productive forces. He promised 
help to many. The war is over. It is necessary to build. Who 
will come to help, and is the foundation not too weak? 
  And furthermore. What do we want from our new representative 
authority, which the executive authority has so successfully 
learned to ignore and the possibility of doing without which was 
cultivated for so long in society? Will it now be a 
counterweight to the managers, or will it begin to obediently 
follow in the direction indicated by the governor's finger?

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation Minister of </F>
Foreign Affairs: "Common European Partnership; Today It Is the 
Key Concept in Russian Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] It has long ago become clear that, under current 
conditions, aggressive nationalism, the doctrines of Brezhnev 
and the "Berlin wall," the aspirations for domination and 
"sanitary cordons" are unacceptable. At the present time it is 
necessary to ensure for all of Europe a strong stability and 
security, and to jointly overcome conflicts on national grounds. 
  In order to achieve this goal, we must develop a consistent 
strategy of action which strengthens the unity of all the 
democratic states of Europe, a common European partnership. 
  Today, agreements on partnership and announcements of 
intentions are clearly apparent. However, there is as yet no 
regulated stable and mature partnership which is backed by the 
necessary resources. 
  This is evidenced by the difficulties which Russia is 
encountering, along with other post-communist countries, in 
conducting negotiations with the Western partners regarding 
access to the market without discrimination and on the basis of 
free competition. For example, today the European Union proposes 
for democratic Russia a ceiling of 10 percent for the export of 
nuclear materials, while even quite recently the Soviet Union 
had 16 percent. 
  Partnership in the political sphere is still being subjected 
to serious trials along the sharp turns of European policy. The 
latest example is the unilateral ultimatum on Sarajevo. One may 
debate the expediency or inexpediency of the threat of using 
forceful measures by a certain deadline. Today this matter has 
passed and there is no sense in returning to a review of all the 
"pros" and "cons." However, it is obvious that the adoption of 
such decisions without consultation, with coordination with all 
the key state officials participating in the search for Yugoslav 
regulation, in this case with Russia, in itself introduces an 
unnecessary element of tension and, frankly speaking, risk. 
  This is why today it is important not to lose the tempo, to 
make use of the moment of positive movement created by the 
initiative of President Boris Yeltsin, which has led to an 
important breakthrough in lifting the blockade of Sarajavo. We 
need energetic and necessarily joint actions. Moreover, these 
may even be rather decisive measures, but they must be jointly 
undertaken. In the context of unified efforts, the individual 
powers, as well as their associations, including NATO, will find 
their place and make their contribution. 
  The block, bipolar system of security is irreversably 
retreating before the realities of a multipolar world. To hold 
onto the illusion, as some naive political scientists do, that a 
membership card in a military-political alliance is a panacea 
for all ills, is to close one's eyes to the essence of the 
processes going on in Europe, to the nature of the crisis of the 
new generation. Such an approach initially presupposes the 
presence if not of a real, then of an imagined enemy. In any 
case, it is fraught with new splits and divisive tears in 
Europe. Moreover, not only are the ghosts of the 
past--aggressive nationalism, territorial aspirations, religious 
intolerance--not retreating, but the danger of their turning 
into a real factor of European policy is increasing. 
  We cannot agree that Europe is experiencing another 
repartition in the zones of influence. According to our 
conviction, it is important not to let the chance to form a 
unified democratic Europe slip by. This presupposes the 
provision of an equal level of security for each state, a real 
partnership on the basis of the common democratic principles of 
the CSCE [Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe]. 
  I am sincerely concerned by the longevity of certain 
outdated 
dogmas and arguments. Some political leaders are even trying to 
pass them off as axioms of current European policy. 
  The first argument: Accelerated membership by the East 
European states in NATO will not only "remove the barriers 
dividing Europe," but "will become a step in strengthening 
democracy and stability, from which Russia itself will stand to 
win." The question is, what Russia? Russia--the great power 
following the path of democratic transformations and openness to 
the world, or an isolated Russia, and consequently one which may 
again turn into a military camp. 
  The second argument, which does not fully correspond with 
the 
first: The expansion of NATO through the East Europeans is 
necessary, since Russia is unpredictable and is infected with 
neoimperialist ambitions. Well, in the case of emergence of new 
barriers in Europe and isolation of Russia, it will become 
predictable: Armed with missiles and threatening its neighbors. 
  The third argument. Russia intends to hinder the states of 
Central and Eastern Europe from meeting their needs for reliable 
security. This too is not so. We do not dispute the sovereign 
right of any country to ensure its own defense, including by 
means of joining in various military-political alliances. But if 
we want a peaceful life for ourselves and our children, the 
criterion here must be the degree to which the steps taken 
facilitate stability in the region as a whole. 
  We are proceeding from the fact that there are no longer 
grounds to class the European countries into those which 
threaten and those which are threatened. Today the Europeans are 
on one side of the barrier, while the problems which they must 
deal with--economic, social, and international--are on the 
other. These are the three components of European security, 
which cannot be divided. 
  For decades, dissident democrats in our countries have 
struggled for common values, turning their glances to the CSCE, 
the only common European structure, which became their Magna 
Carta. 
  Today the national-patriots are encroaching on these values. 
However, for the first time we have the unique capacity to 
defend them, using all the wealth of the existing European 
institutions. 
  From this stems the conception of the common European 
partnership, which Russia proposes. 
  Here are its basic elements. 
  First. Developing Euro-Atlantic cooperation on the 
basis of transformation of the CSCE into an effective 
all-regional political organization, and the Council for North 
Atlantic Cooperation (CNAC)--into an independent structure of 
military-political cooperation, but one which is closely tied to 
the CSCE. The goal is to coordinate the efforts of NATO, the EC 
[European Community], the Council of Europe, the West European 
countries and the WEU [Western European Union], and the CIS in 
the sphere of strengthening stability and security, peacemaking 
and protection of the rights of national minorities in Europe. 
  Second. Increasing cooperation within the 
framework of the CNAC with the involvement of the neutral states 
of Europe, including on the realization of the program, 
"Partnership in the Name of Peace," on an equal basis, and 
turning the CNAC into an independent agency with a compact 
secretariat. The CNAC may become the common European laboratory 
for peacemaking, greater openness in military activity and 
conversion of the VPK [military-industrial complex]. 
  Third. Formulating a network of 
mutually-supplementing bilateral agreements on partnership, 
cooperation and consultations not only between NATO, on the one 
hand, and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, 
Ukraine and so forth, but also between the states which are not 
members of the alliance. We do not exclude the possibility that 
Russia too will someday become a part of NATO, but today the key 
factor is the concept of partnership. The advantage and, if you 
will, the farsightedness of the program adopted by NATO leaders, 
"Partnership in the Name of Peace," consists specifically of the 
fact that it seems to open up NATO and takes the first step in 
changing it over from a block to some other form of security 
organization. And so, common European partnership fits entirely 
into our conception. In the future we see also the opening of a 
channel of communications between the CIS and NATO. 
  Fourth. Granting the countries of Central Europe 
reciprocal guarantees of security on the part of Russia and its 
West European partners. Such a network could be extended to all 
of Europe. 
  Fifth. Increasing the peacemaking potential of the 
European states, seeking a unified response by Europe to the 
conflicts of the new generation. Giving practical aid in 
peacemaking efforts of Russia and the CIS on the territory of 
the former USSR. 
  Sixth. Strengthening the European component of the 
regimen of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, other types of 
mass destruction weapons and missile technologies, as well as 
promises to tighten control over the sale of "dual purpose" 
technologies and the most destructive types of conventional 
weapons, primarily in the zones of conflict. 
  Seventh. Increasing economic potential for 
purposes of stability and security on the continent. Including 
Russia and the states of Eastern Europe in the international 
division of labor on an equal and nondiscriminatory basis, and 
ensuring their entry into the European and world markets. 
  Our proposals echo the concepts expressed in numerous 
European states. We are ready to cooperate closely with our East 
European colleagues in the search for the best decisions and 
realization of a program of partnership.

<F P=106> [Article by Maksim Sokolov: "Tilsit: When This Arrogant </F>
Sound Is Heard Now, a Russian Does Not Turn Pale"] 
  [Text] In analyzing the latest Bosnian topic regarding the 
NATO bombardments of Serbian artillery batteries, Russian 
columnists prepare this subject in a remarkable manner. At the 
center of the analysis turns out to be only the fortunate 
outcome brought about by Russian diplomats, while the prologue, 
the beginning, the development of the operation and even the 
culmination (i.e., bringing the NATO bombers into combat 
readiness) prove to be, as it were, outside the topic. In other 
words (in an especially striking manner, this distinctive 
feature is manifested in the analysis given by USSR President 
[as published] Mikhail Gorbachev on February 22), the Western 
ultimatum and the Russian shuttle diplomacy are regarded not as 
interconditional details of one design, but as the opposition of 
completely autonomous models of conduct. On the one hand, the 
Serbs are handed by the West an ultimatum insulting to their 
national honor, on the other--"again in the foggy north one 
could hear the thunder prophesy: Then, with the cross as his 
martial armor, the older brother of the Slavonic peoples, stood 
up." 
  It is possible that the unwillingness to examine the events 
that have taken place in interdependence is explained by the 
general principle of the approach to international conflicts, 
according to which turning to the prehistory is unproductive and 
only confuses everything and aggravates the problem. 
Psychologically it is understandable that the desire to get away 
from a one-sided (or seemingly one-sided) etizatsiya [perhaps 
etnizatsiya for ethnization] of the conflict: First, in the 
concepts of guilt and responsibility, then--even completely 
extra-moral cause and effect categories. 
  As a result, the analysis begins to acquire visible 
characteristics of an anecdote. In making an expert assessment 
of the crisis, the deputy editor-in-chief of MOSKOVSKIYE 
NOVOSTI, Aleksey Pushkov (one of the most restrained and 
conscientious analysts) pointed out, on the one hand, that "the 
most reasonable and constructive forces" in NATO itself were 
opposed to a solution by force, on the other--that, without a 
doubt, the reasonable and constructive Russian mediation could 
not have succeeded, had it not been supported by the real threat 
of force in the form of the NATO ultimatum. If the two 
statements are reduced to one, it is easy to understand that, 
had the "reasonable and constructive forces" in NATO prevailed, 
nothing would have come from the no less "reasonable and 
constructive" mediation of the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, and this means that the whole Russian "reasonableness 
and constructiveness" would not have been worth a nickel had it 
not been supported by the "unreasonable and non-constructive" 
ultimatum. 
  The paradoxical character of the analysis can be explained 
if 
we make a transition from international to criminal law. Russia 
conducted itself as a juridical subject, bailing out the 
juvenile hooligan Radovan Karadzic. The reeducation of young 
hooligans by means of bailing them out in certain cases is quite 
appropriate. Only it must be remembered that in the absence of 
the police (i. e., the NATO bombers), which in the beginning was 
able to stop the hooligan, and inn the future may also interfere 
if the person bailed out does not justify the trust put in him, 
the institution of bail loses all meaning. Criminal punishment 
exists only to the extent to which it has a potential for 
completely unconditional sanction; if the latter is absent, the 
former also disappears. 
  Probably, the desire to pretend that this bail was assumed, 
as it were, per se, and not as the result of the sanction being 
expected is explained by the deep patriotism of the analysts. In 
a situation where the threat of force is a decisive factor, the 
role of a mediator who cannot or does not want to oppose 
anything serious to this threat usually does not bring great 
honor, and that is why the desire to suppress for clarity the 
decisive significance which the threat of military sanctions in 
reality had, is entirely understandable. 
  Mutatis mutandis, the great successes of 
Yeltsin--Kozyrev--Churkin are reminiscent of the Peace of 
Tilsit, when Alexander I also also engaged in the forceful 
defense of his traditional and very loyal ally, the Prussian 
King Frederick William. "An ignoble king, an ignoble nation, and 
an ignoble army, a power, which has deceived all and does not 
deserve to exist," this is what Napoleon told Alexander about 
his friend, to whom the Russian czar in his time so touchingly 
swore eternal alliance and love on the grave of Frederick II. In 
response, Alexander smiled affectionately and only asked the 
French emperor "to leave nevertheless something of Prussia, in 
spite of all of these reprehensible qualities." The monarchical 
historians, because of the complete uselessness, did not even 
make special efforts to embellish the sour position in which 
Alexander I had found himself in Tilsit. The newest historians, 
in praising the mission of Churkin, are clearly guided by the 
revisionist poem of Pushkin: "Tilsit! When this arrogant sound 
is heard, a Russian does not grow pale now." 
  The difficulty of the position of the newest historians lies 
in the fact that the true significance of the effectively 
utilized NATO threat of force can be concealed once, while the 
given method of the pacification of the warring Slavs was very 
much to the liking of the West, and a repetition is by no means 
out of the question. To declare that every new Tilsit is a new 
and still more glorious success of Russian diplomacy will be 
difficult for the keenest political scientists.

Belgrade: "A Life Preserver"] 
  [Text] No matter how strange, but in Belgrade and even in 
the Serbian part of Sarajevo there was, during the 10 days when 
the NATO ultimatum was in effect, no manifestation of a special 
anxiety, commensurate with the threat hanging over the Serbs. 
Moreover, a number of signs point to the fact that the 
leadership of Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serbs did not consider 
as serious the NATO threat to inflict strikes on the Serbian 
artillery positions near Sarajevo and was originally convinced 
of the political settlement of this conflict. 
  To all the appeals of a number of opposition parties to 
convene an extraordinary session of the Serbian parliament to 
discuss the impending threat, the leader of the parliamentary 
faction of the ruling Socialist Party answered with a refusal, 
alluding to the great effectiveness of secret diplomatic efforts 
and the needlessness of additional dramatization of the 
situation. 
  The military-political leadership of the Serbian side did 
not 
believe in the effectiveness of NATO air strikes and calmly 
waited for the outcome of the situation. To conduct a large air 
operation in Bosnia in February would be extremely difficult 
because of the weather conditions. Constant fog, low clouds, and 
strong winds sharply decrease the possibility of precise 
bomb-release, not to speak of the threat of large 
weather-related air plane losses alone. Incidentally, during the 
period of the ultimatumm, two NATO planes were involved in a 
catastrophe over the Adriatic Sea (the last smashed in Slovenia, 
miraculously not having caused a calamity in connection with the 
possible explosion of ammunition and fuel on board). 
  Combat flights over Sarajevo with the bombing and launching 
of missiles aimed at Serbian batteries located at times in 
residential quarters, next to places where contingents of the UN 
forces are stationed, next to Muslim districts, could already 
during the first days lead to hundreds of victims among the 
civilian population and even the "blue helmets." It is not 
difficult to imagine what an echo this would produce in the 
Western countries. 
  Moreover, the "first demonstrative strikes" would 
practically 
decide anything as regards the demolition of the fire power of 
Serbian artillery, having several reserve positions each. During 
the early stage of the ultimatum the commanders of the Bosnian 
Serbs openly talked about this. The neutralization of the 500 
(and possibly even more) firing positions of the Serbs would 
require massive carpet bombing for a period of 2 weeks, moreover 
from various directions. The refusal of Greece to make available 
its military bases for the NATO operation at once sharply 
decreased the chances for quick success. The potential of the 
military airports in Italy, as well as the aircraft carrier 
Saratoga, was clearly inadequate. 
  If we add to this the enormous probability of unwanted hits 
of civilian objects, the potential possibility of the capture of 
French and British "blue helmets" by the Serbs, the 
discontinuation of humanitarian convoys, saving the Muslim 
population from hunger and its army--from demoralization, 
reciprocal actions of the Serbian side, both against NATO 
aircraft and the Muslims, and possible terrorist acts of Serbian 
extremists in NATO countries, it becomes clear that the Brussels 
ultimatum was sooner adventurist than a well-considered course 
of military experts. It is no accident that the German minister 
of foreign affairs, K. Kinkel, a number of times talked about 
the fact that the West has a clear concept only about the first 
step, but not about the second and third one. 
  On the other hand, it was disadvantageous for Belgrade to 
subject the NATO bloc to possible humiliation, compelling it to 
proceed to an escalation of the conflict, to aggravate the 
animosity of the West to the Serbian side, and thereby to let 
slip out of its hands a realistic prospect for the abolition of 
the sanctions. Figuratively speaking, Belgrade was not 
interested in defeating the West above the Sarajevo hills and 
was worried only about having its position understood in the 
Western capitals. The Bosnian Serbs, who had no objection to 
playing with fire, had a different sentiment. 
  It was at this moment that the Russian initiative appeared, 
which became the life preserver for both NATO and the Serbian 
side. NATO clearly feels that, having threatened the Serbs, it 
can only smash its fist, but Belgrade and the capital of the 
Bosnian Serbs, Pale, are ripening for the next compromise, which 
does not promise them military advantages, but gives them 
considerable political dividends. And the main thing--a good 
reason for retreat presented itself. 
  Also remarkable is the fact that even Western propaganda on 
the threshold of the hysteria of the NATO ultimatum held back. 
The first program of French television provided information 
about a sensational secret report of UN experts to the effect 
that the mortar shell on the Sarajevo market (because of which 
the Bosnian NATO ultimatum occurred) was launched from Muslim 
positions. This report of French Television made the rounds of 
the tapes of all leading news agencies and the pages of Western 
newspapers. Although at the time, when earlier TANJUG [Yugoslav 
News Agency] reported about such a secret meeting of UN experts, 
no one demonstratively called any attention to this. In short, 
the ground for an "honorable retreat" was being prepared on the 
part of NATO. 
  What next? In the opinion of experts, the military situation 
in Sarajevo has not changed in a major way since the guns that 
have been withdrawn can be returned in a few hours to the 
previous positions. It will be more difficult to take the arms 
collected in eight areas in the city limits out of reserve 
storage since they are being guarded by the "blue helmets." 
However, here, too, the principle of a "double key" is observed, 
and in the case of acute necessity both the Serbs and the 
Muslims may again use them. But, it would appear, that neither 
the one, nor the other side for the time being is seeking 
conflicts with the UN contingents and is inclined to observe the 
armistice. Now, apparently, a great deal will be decided by the 
choice of priorities made by the great powers involved in the 
Bosnian crisis.

"Topic of Current Interest": "The Performance and Tasks of 
Russian Foreign Trade"] 
  [Text] A collegium of the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations met a few days ago. The results of the 
operation of the ministry last year were discussed at the 
meeting and the main directions for work in 1994 set forth. 
After the proceedings of the collegium, Minister of Foreign 
Economic Relations Oleg Davydov invited several Russian 
journalists to a meeting, in which he shared his considerations 
concerning the status of Russia's foreign trade and answered 
numerous questions. We offer our readers a brief report on this 
meeting. 
<H5>  Exports Have Stabilized </H5>
  In 1993 the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations 
structured 
its work on the basis of the program of the Government of Russia 
"Development of Reforms and Stabilization of the Russian 
Economy." It was particularly important for us to actually carry 
out the first stage of this program scheduled for 1993-1995. The 
ministry concentrated its efforts on this. We continued work to 
shape a mechanism for the regulation of foreign economic 
activities in the period of transition. It is based on further 
liberalization through cutting back measures of nontariff 
regulation and switching to mostly economic methods, at the same 
time streamlining the system of export and currency control. The 
stabilization of exports and the growth of foreign exchange 
proceeds testify that the measures being taken are effective. At 
the same time, major problems have yet to be solved in the area 
of foreign exchange regulation; there have been instances of 
violations of legislation in the foreign economic sector. 
  Despite the overall worsening of conditions for trade, 
Russian exports (volume in terms of value) stabilized in 1993, 
coming to $43 billion. A considerable positive balance was 
achieved in trade with distant foreign countries in the amount 
of $16 billion. This was ensured primarily by increasing the 
physical volume of deliveries of raw and other materials. 
  Changes in the geographical breakdown of exports caused the 
share of industrialized countries to increase from 58 percent in 
1992 to 60 percent in 1993, and that of developing 
countries--from 11 to 14 percent, respectively. The share of the 
former member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance fell from 19 to 17 percent. 
  Germany, China, Great Britain, Japan, France, the United 
States, Hungary, and Finland hold leading positions in Russian 
exports. Exports to the countries of Southeast Asia--Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea--have developed at 
a high rate. 
  In the opinion of the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations, the slump in industrial production in 
Russia, worsening trends on the world market, and failure to 
solve the problems of state support for exports, including 
funding and insurance for them, have affected the volume, 
breakdown, and rate of growth of exports. Besides, exports 
experienced powerful pressure from industrialized countries, 
which have taken discriminatory measures against Russian trade. 
The interest of exporters in making deliveries of a number of 
types of products fell sharply. This happened as a result of the 
growth of domestic prices, transportation outlays, and high 
interest rates on bank credit. 
  Nonetheless, proceeds in foreign exchange from the exports 
of 
goods went up in 1993, reaching $16 billion. In the opinion of 
the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, 
this testifies to the gradual assertion of export and foreign 
exchange control, especially over the deliveries of 
strategically important raw material products. 
<H5>  We Have Begun To Import Less </H5>
  Compared to 1992, Russian imports fell last year by almost 
30 
percent and came to $27 billion, which is mainly associated with 
the pursued policy of reducing state expenditures, including 
those for centralized imports; the latter declined by a factor 
of two. We also began to purchase less abroad due to restricting 
foreign borrowing, implementing a policy of containing credit 
extension, gradually abolishing subsidization of imports from 
the budget, and introducing the value-added tax on imported 
goods. 
  Industrialized countries accounted for 54 percent of the 
total volume of imports (62 percent in 1992), developing 
countries for 18 percent (14 percent), and former member 
countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance for 11 
percent (15 percent). 
  The greatest volume of import purchases was generated in 
Germany, China, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Great 
Britain, and Hungary. 
  To be sure, we cannot fail to note that the existing 
methodology of registering statistical data in the area of 
foreign trade with which the State Committee on Statistics and, 
consequently, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations operate 
is far from perfect. This methodology was developed with the 
quite recently existing monopoly of the state in the area of 
foreign economic relations factored in; in many cases, it is 
simply not functional. For example, numbers indicate that trade 
between Russia and Sweden is declining; but according to Swedish 
estimates it is increasing, and at a quite confident rate. 
  In Stockholm they believe that Russia has moved from 32d to 
28th place in Swedish exports. The explanation is quite simple: 
Unlike Russian statistics, Swedish statistics are based on 
registration of the volume of commodity flows crossing the 
border of the country; for this reason, they also register 
things exported by private persons. Given our current Russian 
reality, whereby customs duties have increased sharply, a 
majority of importing companies, for example, importers of 
automobiles, perform their operations precisely through private 
persons. 
  In the opinion of Oleg Davydov, the latest changes in the 
leadership of the State Committee on Statistics should ensure a 
change for the better in this area. In his words, so far it has 
been virtually impossible in some cases to obtain accurate data; 
he personally encountered this in his numerous attempts to learn 
about the volume of trade with Baltic countries. 
<H5>  Great Changes Are Forthcoming </H5>
  In the near future, by all signs from next year on, the 
approach to Russia as a country with state foreign trade will 
hardly be applicable. As Oleg Davydov stated, the state is 
planning to fully withdraw from this sphere of activities in 
1995. All indications are that this will occasion major changes 
in the structure of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations 
itself. 
  As far as changes directly in the area of export and import 
operations are concerned, the determination to discontinue grain 
purchases abroad beginning next year is noteworthy. In general, 
Russian foreign trade will to a considerable degree depend on 
the domestic economic situation, what paths the reforms take, 
and what the next steps of the Russian Government in the 
economic area turn out to be. 
  The main avenues for the operation of the Ministry of 
Foreign 
Economic Relations in 1994 are: 
  --perfecting the regulatory and legal base for regulating 
foreign economic activities (VED); 
  --cutting back administrative methods and perfecting 
economic 
methods for the regulation of foreign economic activities; 
  --reinforcing export and foreign exchange control; 
  --creating a favorable regimen of trade in relations with 
foreign countries; 
  --ensuring the accomplishment of tasks in export and import 
operations to meet federal state needs; 
  --ensuring support for Russian exports; 
  --stimulating the attraction of foreign investment to 
Russia; 
  --settling the issue of the repayment of the debt of foreign 
states to Russia; 
  --coordinating and facilitating the development of foreign 
economic activities of the regions of Russia; 
  --improving informational and cadre support for foreign 
economic activities. 
  All the above avenues appear important. However, it makes 
sense to focus in particular on problems associated with the 
operation of the currency market in Russia. The point is that, 
in the environment of a high rate of inflation, the exchange 
rate of the ruble on the currency market has recently been 
maintained at an artificially high level. As a result, a 
paradoxical situation developed in January--even the export of 
oil and refinery products from Russia ended up unprofitable at 
the maintained ratio of 1,160 rubles [R] to the dollar. Oleg 
Davydov believes that had the exchange rate of the ruble not 
fallen below the line of R1,500 to the dollar, export shipments 
could have simply stopped. Consequently, foreign exchange 
proceeds from exports, which come to $3-3.5 billion, would have 
ceased. 
  Therefore, the sphere of foreign economic activities 
develops 
in a close interrelationship with domestic economic development. 
When particular measures are implemented in the economic sphere, 
it is necessary to soberly evaluate the entire range of possible 
side effects which, in terms of consequences, may prove far more 
serious than temporary advantages, even if they set the noble 
goal of ensuring stability of the national currency.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhova: "A Decisive Stage of GATT </F>
Negotiations. Russia's Path to GATT Does Not Promise To Be 
Brief"] 
  [Text] Thursday evening after another round of GATT 
negotiations, the delegation from the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations returned from Brussels. They had managed to 
coordinate the model for integration into this system, that is, 
clarify the details of the complex procedure that Russia will 
have to go through. One might say that Moscow stands on the 
threshold of the GATT. The head of the delegation, Minister of 
Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, reflects on the subject 
of whether or not Russia will manage to cross this 
threshold. 
  In Mr. Davydov's opinion, in order to gain equal 
opportunities and rights in the markets of the world, Russia 
must conclude two agreements in the near future--with GATT and 
the EC. Membership in GATT will make it possible to avoid 
sanctions (which today are applied against Moscow without any 
discussion) in a civilized way, that is, at the level of the 
GATT Council. Without even having joined GATT yet, Russia is 
already making plans for membership in another organization--the 
World Trade Association (WTA). This product of the Uruguay round 
of GATT, in addition to purely trade issues, will concentrate on 
problems of investment policy, intellectual property, and 
services. The WTA charter has not been written yet. But, in Mr. 
Davydov's words, it is already clear that if Russia enters GATT, 
it will be easier for her to join the WTA as well. After all 
participants in the agreement familiarize themselves with the 
statement of Russia's intention to join their ranks, Moscow must 
within six weeks provide responses to all questions they have 
(which should be addressed to Russia within a month) and then, 
in the event that disputes or trade conflicts arise, all 
problems are to be regulated on a bilateral basis. Only after 
this, and if she is supported by two-thirds of the votes of the 
Council, will Russia be considered to be accepted into GATT. 
Incidentally, in Mr. Davydov's words, it took the well-suited 
Switzerland six years to do this, while the less stable Mexico 
and Venezuela required only a year. And China entered GATT in 
1983. 
  Additionally, the fact that Russia's trade legislation does 
not correspond to international trade legislation is an obstacle 
to her joining the agreement. Russian import tariffs are a "bone 
of contention." In the words of the chief of the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations, the ministry has particularly spoken 
out against raising tariffs for foodstuffs. And the West is 
dissatisfied with the fact that the current import tariff in 
Russia is three to four times higher than the European one. In 
order to coordinate all the issues related to this, a 
tariff-customs council has been formed in Russia. Although, as 
the minister especially emphasized, nobody except the consumers 
and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, "which 
completely understands the need for free competition within 
Russia and advises in favor of entering GATT," is interested in 
reducing the import tariffs. 
  [Begin boxed item] 
<H5>  COMMENTARY </H5>
  A red carpet is not likely to be spread out on Russia's path 
to GATT. All one need do is look at the course of the 
negotiations with this organization's leaders--from promises to 
complete this procedure by the end of 1993 to the postponement 
of the deadlines until the end of this year. Incidentally, this 
date too will probably be moved into the unforeseeable future: 
The regulation of disputes with the EC Commission (for example, 
regarding uranium and aluminum) is proceeding with a fair amount 
of difficulty. And one can hardly count on Russia's getting 
around these tough spots during the course of the GATT 
procedures, for example, the bilateral talks with France and the 
United States--the main ones wrangling over these questions. A 
great deal will depend on whether the Commission of European 
Communities abandons its positions, which have already been 
coordinated with Russia, relative to the need for mutual 
observance of GATT principles, which they think nothing of 
violating even in the EC.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bardin and Aleksandr Volynets: "Foreign </F>
Economic Regulation in Playing the Swan, the Crab, and the Pike"] 
  [Text] Two weeks ago, we wrote about how Russian 
departments are mastering economic methods of regulating foreign 
economic activity. This week the former unity was no longer 
there. The government decree "On Coordination Organs on 
Currency-Financial Questions," in spite of its conciliatory 
name, by eliminating the currency-economics commission, could 
aggravate the age-old interdepartmental dispute about access to 
the distribution of Western credit. At the meeting of the 
government commission on operational issues, the latest version 
of the new import tariff was approved, and in parallel the GTK 
[State Customs Committee] with its instruction, "On Exemption 
From Payment of Customs Duties of the Russian Fund for Disabled 
Veterans of the War in Afghanistan," is legalizing the almost 
forgotten but still no less attractive practice of granting 
customs benefits just like that--for an organization. As a 
result, there are gaps in the system of regulation, of which 
participants in foreign economic activity could very well take 
advantage. 
<H3>  The Ministry of Finance Has Its Own Credit, and the Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Relations Has Its Own </H3>
  The restructuring of the government apparatus, which was 
brought about by the reduction by half of the number of deputy 
prime ministers, was reflected particularly in the elimination 
of the currency-economic commission, "because the tasks assigned 
to it had been performed." This wording, unfortunately, does not 
mean that there is no centralized currency left at all. It comes 
from two main sources: exports credited to state quotas and 
foreign credits. The former is under the jurisdiction of the 
Ministry of Finance, as the holder of budget funds. It has the 
firm intention of taking control of and distributing Western 
credit granted to Russia. But in practice, although the 
conclusion of the Ministry of Finance will be taken into account 
in each specific case, the old method is most likely to be used: 
the submission of the question at the level of some collegial 
government organ. And it will have to weigh the claims of the 
departments, that is, at least a deputy prime minister will have 
to head this commission. Of the available deputy prime 
ministers, only Oleg Soskovets is suitable for playing this 
role, and he is already in charge of a commission on operational 
issues, which will actually expand its authority. 
  For now the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations [MFER], 
under whose wing the Russian Export-Import Bank (Roseksimbank) 
is being created, will provide an example of independent 
extension of lines of credit. While Roseksimbank must initially 
grant ruble credit to producers of export products, in the 
future it will not be prohibited from drawing to itself some of 
the credit of "related" Western banks, in whose distribution the 
MFER will not have the last word. The credit priorities of the 
MFER have already been determined: joint-stock companies and 
state enterprises under its jurisdiction. 
<H3>  The New Import Tariff Has Not Even Been Adopted, but Ways 
Around It Have Already Been Devised </H3>
  At the meeting of the commission on operational questions, 
which in principle approved the new import tariff to take effect 
on 15 March, it was stated that the average level of customs 
rates ranges from 7.5 to 18 percent. On the whole, the rates are 
simply being increased. But, according to the assessment of the 
deputy minister of economics, Sergey Vasilyev, the lobbies of 
the Russian automotive and aircraft builders are committing 
"highway robbery" with their high offensive import duties. Thus, 
to the traditional commodity groups that enjoy increased customs 
protection--alcohol and liquor products, motor vehicles, 
electric household appliances, equipment for petroleum and gas 
extraction (such is the condition for receiving the associated 
credit from the American Export-Import Bank)--they may also add 
aircraft (recently Russian airline companies have preferred 
Boeing), products of the textile industry, and foodstuffs. The 
struggle of the branch representatives is not over, and the 
question of the customs tariff is to be considered again at a 
meeting of the government next Thursday. Moreover, the influence 
of branch lobbies is apparently becoming a permanent thing: At 
the meeting it was suggested that they create a Tariff-Customs 
Council, which would be authorized to work out operational 
changes in the rates of customs tariffs (the government would 
still make the final decision). But customs duties are not the 
only thing affecting the dynamic of imports. In January, when 
exchange rates were favorable for imports, new excise taxes led 
to an absolute reduction of imports as compared to January of 
last year. It cannot be ruled out that on 15 March the 
inevitable (although, possibly, partial) successes of the 
supporters of raising rates of the import tariff for certain 
branches of industry will be accompanied by a marked decline of 
the ruble, which will make import activity a losing proposition. 
But not for everyone. 
  The GTK has returned the benefits to disabled Afghanistan 
veterans, the same ones that were taken away last July in 
compliance with the law on the customs tariff. This time the 
basis for the decision of the GTK was the president's edict, "On 
Measures for State Support for the Activity of All-Russian 
Public Associations of Disabled Persons." Yet under that same 
law (Article 34) the newly granted benefits "may not be of an 
individual nature." The benefits were localized by concrete 
contracts. It is an important precedent, however: A breach has 
been made in customs barriers that worsen conditions mainly for 
import activity, which in principle may be utilized by more than 
disabled Afghanistan veterans. The technology is well known: 
variations on the theme of sale of contracts and supplements to 
them as futures. But the main thing is that the Afghanistan 
veterans have laid a path that can now be widened, and importers 
and exporters have been given a point for application of their 
efforts.

<F P=106> [Article: "The French Are Ready To Re-equip Russia's Nuclear </F>
Power Stations: Visit by the President of Groupe Schneider"] 
  [Text] The French industrial Groupe Schneider 
yesterday signed protocols governing cooperation with Gazprom 
and with the Rosenergoatom concern of Minatomenergo [Ministry of 
Atomic Energy]. Scheduled to occur simultaneously with these 
events was the visit to Moscow by Didie Pineau-Valencienne, 
president of Groupe Schneider. The signed agreements can be 
evaluated as the beginning of large-scale Russo-French 
cooperation in the area of nuclear power engineering and the 
transporting of petroleum and gas. 
  [Editorial note] Groupe Schneider is one of the world 
leaders in the area of developing and producing electrical-power 
engineering units and systems for monitoring production cycles 
and distributing electrical power. It includes 180 industrial 
enterprises and has representations on 130 countries. Its annual 
turnover exceeds 61 billion francs. Cooperation with Russian 
entrepreneurs began in the 1880's with the construction of 
bridges in St. Petersburg. Schneider also delivered equipment 
for KamAZ, GAZ, ZIL, and a number of enterprises in the chemical 
industry. 
  The cooperation protocol signed by the Schneider president 
and by Erik Pozdyshev, president of the Rosenergoatom concern, 
stipulates the modernization of the control and protection 
system at the Kola AES within the framework of the program for 
technical assistance to the CIS countries, which is being 
implemented by the European Economic Community (TACIS). Other 
projects that have been planned are the Kalinin AES 
(modernization of the medium- and low-voltage distribution 
devices), as well as the Balakovo and Smolensk AES, where work 
will be done to improve the physical protection. It is planned 
to finance the projects along EEC lines. Commenting on this 
agreement, M. Pineau-Valencienne remarked that in France 75 
percent of the electrical energy is produced by nuclear 
electrical-power stations, and, from the ecological point of 
view, nuclear power engineering, provided that a reliable safety 
system is functioning, meets the highest requirements. 
  In accordance with the cooperation protocol between 
Schneider 
and Gazprom, it is planned to carry out operations to modernize 
the electrical equipment at the compressor stations of 
practically all the existing Russian petroleum and gas 
pipelines. Answering a question asked by a KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
correspondent concerning the prospects for a resultant increase 
in the exportation of Russian gas to France, the Schneider 
president confirmed this possibility as a result of the 
reduction of shipments from Algeria. 
  Touching upon the Groupe Schneider strategy in the Russian 
market, M. Pineau-Valencienne commented that its basic positions 
would be cooperation in guaranteeing the safety of Russia's 
existing nuclear electrical-power stations, systems for 
automatic control and monitoring of the operation of AES, and 
the modernization of Russian petroleum and gas pipelines with 
Schneider electrical equipment. The industrial group's sphere of 
interests also includes the exchanging of progressive 
technologies, the production of individual types of French 
equipment at Russian enterprises, and the training of Russian 
personnel. 
  KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts remark that the visit by the 
president of Groupe Schneider may encourage competition among 
the leading Western concerns to obtain production orders in the 
field of transporting gas and modernizing Russian AES.

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Pechilina: "The Status of Sheremetyevo-2 </F>
May Drop Soon: Tender for Construction of the Airport in Kazan"] 
  [Text] In Tatarstan there are serious intentions to 
convert the Kazan airport into a basic gateway on the air route 
from Europe to Asia. Yesterday the results of an international 
tender for the modernization of the Kazan airport were 
announced. The winner has proven to be the BOUYGES firm 
(France). The modification of the airport may involve the 
reorientation of the network of air communications between 
Europe and Asia, since the path by way of Kazan saves more than 
an hour of flight time as compared with flights by way of 
Sheremetyevo-2. 
  As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already reported, it was proposed to 
the winners in the first stage of the tender that was held in 
June-August of last year -- the companies BOUYGES (France); Spie 
Batignolles (France, Turkey); Kodest (Italy); and Jugodrvo 
(Yugoslavia) -- that they modify the plans in conformity with 
the terms of the technical assignment. Yesterday the tender 
committee announced that the winner is the BOUYGES firm, which 
developed a plan with a total cost of $198,360,000, and which 
guarantees the complete handing over of the project in three 
years. 
  [Editorial note] The French BOUYGES construction 
company was created in 1954. It has branches in 84 countries 
throughout the world. Its annual turnover is $13 billion and it 
has 150,000 employees. It is the owner of French television 
Channel 1. 
  [Editorial note] The Kazan airport provides for the 
acceptance of 8000 passengers and 113,840 tons of freight a 
year. In 1992 it was accepted into the Association of 
International Airports. It has regular air communication with 
Turkey. 
  The modernization of the Kazan airport stipulates the 
construction of a runway that can accommodate the operation of 
aircraft of all types (including the Boeing-747-400 and the 
IL-96-300), the air terminal building, and a hangar for the 
technical servicing of aircraft. Subsequently a technical 
service center, freight terminals, and a hotel will be built. 
  According to BOUYGES commercial director Pierre Boiche, the 
modernization will make it possible to increase the airport's 
handling capacity to 1000 passengers an hour. The project 
stipulates the creation of a joint enterprise in which 51 
percent of the shares will belong to Tatarstan, and 49 percent 
to an association of foreign firms that is headed by BOUYGES. 
Tatarstan's share, as viewed by the project initiators, is in 
the form of offering the French side the right to use the Kazan 
airport, including the ground on which it is located, for a 
period of no less than 25 years. France's investment includes 
monetary funds, technologies, and participation in the 
construction. It is planned to finance the project along two 
credit lines: from the French government and the YeBRR [European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development] at 7 percent annual 
interest. M. Boiche also mentioned as possible investors the 
French companies Thomson, Alcatel, and Total. In order to obtain 
credit, Tatarstan government guarantees will be required. 
According to Valeriy Stekolshchikov, vice-premier of Tatarstan 
and chairman of the tender commission, it is planned to begin 
implementing the project during the current year. 
  Plans for constructing new air-transportation centers in the 
CIS have arisen not only in Tatarstan. People in St. Petersburg 
are considering the possibility of expanding the Pulkovo airport 
in order to convert it into a center for air shipments in the 
northwest region of Russia. This may also exert an influence on 
reducing the status of Sheremetyevo-2 as the main international 
airport in the CIS. 
  [Note, signed "Business Department"] The remodeling of the 
Kazan airport, which does not yet meet the requirements that are 
made for a major world-class air-transportation center, 
presupposes the future competition between the Kazan airport and 
Sheremetyevo-2, which in the CIS today is the basic point where 
international air lines intersect. One cannot fail to mention 
the scheme that was proposed for the first time in projects of 
this type -- the scheme for "backup" insuring of the risk taken 
by the foreign partner, when, in addition to the granting of 
governmental guarantees, what is practically the taking of the 
airport under pledge is proposed. Tatarstan's agreement to this 
attests to the intention to construct the airport at any price. 
In general, similar airports are constructed abroad only after 
the confirmation of the intentions to use it on the part of the 
leading air companies. However, the representations of British 
Airways, Air France, and Lufthansa have not yet commented on 
their actions in this instance, although the possibility that 
Kazan can accept Boeing-747 liners, which are the basic aircraft 
for the long-distance lines of the leading air carriers in the 
world, cannot fail to attract the attention of those carriers.

  [Text] Energy Minister Jann Sjursen (Christian People's 
Party) and DONG [Danish Oil and Natural Gas (Consortium)] 
Chairman Holger Lavesen have begun talks with Russia's energy 
minister on using Danish expertise in the race for the enormous 
oil and gas reserves in Russia. 
  The Russians are interested in attracting Danish know-how. 
Up 
to 40 percent of the world reserves of natural gas are found in 
Russia. 
  In connection with the just-completed visit to Moscow, 
discussions were initiated among Sjursen, DONG Chairman Lavesen, 
and Russian Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik. 
  "Among other subjects brought up were the possibilities for 
employing Danish expertise with respect to geological 
explorations and legislation dealing with the underground area," 
said Sjursen. 
  "In the area of gas and oil, there may also be interest in 
cooperating with regard to know-how, exporting, organizational 
issues, and tariff systems, as well as to training and 
management programs." 
  A number of enterprises and organizations from the Danish 
energy sector participated in the trip to Moscow, where at a 
seminar in the Russian energy ministry they had opportunity to 
present Danish technology and know-how in a number of 
energy-related fields, such as electricity and heat generating, 
district heating, renewable energy, oil and gas, as well as 
metering of consumer use. 
  "In the conversations with Shafranik I received a very 
current briefing on the enormous problems plaguing the Russian 
energy sector. Among other ways, these are revealed in falling 
energy production and in the serious debt crisis experienced in 
many Russian energy companies," continued Sjursen. 
  A cooperation agreement, which had been under preparation 
over a long period, was signed by the two ministers during the 
visit.

Nesterenko, and Vladimir Li, KAZTAG and KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA 
correspondents: "Parliamentary Elections Are Over. Now We Have 
To Sort Out Who Got Elected"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  ALMATY </H5>
  The three-month-long election marathon in Kazakhstan, which 
was to determine the composition of the first professional 
parliament and new local representative bodies--maslikhats--has 
reached the finish line. On 7 March, At exactly 0700, the doors 
of more than 10,000 republic election precincts opened, almost 
7,000 of them in rural settlements and at animal breeders' 
winter camps. Kazakhstan citizens abroad also voted--at 14 
precincts in our representations. 
  Almaty election precincts were crowded from the very early 
morning. This confirmed once again the validity of sociological 
services' forecasts: Population polls conducted on the eve of 
the elections showed that at least 70 percent of the voters 
intended to participate. Most of them, in answering 
correspondents' questions before dropping the ballot in the box, 
did not hide that they would choose progressively-minded 
candidates for deputies. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev and his spouse came to cast their votes 
at the election precinct set up in Friendship House. The head of 
the government held an impromptu press conference for local and 
foreign journalists on the spot. The questions asked were mainly 
one and the same, just different phraseology: What hopes does 
the president pin on the new parliament? 
  I hope very much, he said, that a professional parliament 
will work more actively than the old one, and will contribute 
more to the democratization of our young sovereign state, the 
advancement of economic reforms, and the reorganization of the 
legal system. In order to successfully carry out this role, it 
will have to adopt laws that will realistically advance 
transformations in the republic and at the same time will 
attract Western investors into its economy. 
  Journalists got no reply to the question, however, which of 
the candidates for Supreme Council deputy seats did the 
Nazarbayevs vote for. All I can tell you, joked the president, 
is that my wife and I had no disagreement in this respect. 
  Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko also cast his vote in the 
same precinct. In an interview by journalists he emphasized that 
in any civilized country the government and the parliament are 
in certain opposition to each other, and this is quite logical. 
But at the same time, it is very important for the Supreme 
Council to adopt laws and decrees that the government could 
realistically carry out and that would be backed by financial 
and material resources. Deputies should not make strictly 
populist decisions. 
  One of the precincts was located in Kazakh Secondary School 
No. 12 in the center of the capital. The stream of voters here 
was such that lines quite often formed to the enclosed ballot 
booths. There are quite a few young people, and this clearly 
refutes certain maxims on this subject: Our youth, they say, is 
apolitical. 
  Vice President Erik Asanbayev came to cast his vote here. 
Answering correspondents' questions, he said that he believes in 
the vitality of the republic's future first professional 
parliament. The Supreme Council is elected on a multiparty basis 
and reflects the attitudes and interests of a most diverse 
social strata. This is what provides hope that the new 
parliament will meet the expectations of the republic's 
multinational population and will become a real and effective 
representative power. 
  Its professional level, in the vice president's opinion, 
will 
be determined not just by the degree of deputies' personal 
abilities--the old Supreme Soviet also had quite a few competent 
specialists and scientists. The important part is that now 
drafting and adopting laws becomes the only business of 
parliament members. 
<H5>  SHYMKENT </H5>
  The elections just held have been dubbed not only the most 
democratic but also the most difficult. Probably for the first 
time in several decades, ballots could not be delivered to two 
election precincts in the southern part of Kazakhstan--the Ugam 
animal husbandry distant pastures in Kazgurtskiy Rayon, where 47 
voters live, and the Taykanu precinct in Suzakskiy Rayon, with 
its 380 voters. Because of weather conditions, a military 
armored vehicle and an all-terrain vehicle were dispatched to 
deliver ballots to Taykanu. Another spell of raging elements 
kept even them from arriving at the election precinct in time. 
Moreover, until the last moment there was no information on the 
whereabouts of the crews. All other election precincts opened on 
time on 7 March. In oblast rayons voters quite actively and, by 
old habit, early in the morning went to fulfill their civic 
duty. The election headquarters, set up under the oblast 
administration, where all information flowed, by lunchtime 
breathed a sigh of relief: The voter turnout would be 
sufficient. As British observer Steve Lane noted, in Sayrama he 
saw early in the morning voter activism, enthusiasm, and lines 
to voting booths. 
  Shymkent's election precincts did not begin to buzz with 
life 
until 1000-1100. At that time, one could see sizable lines for 
the ballots and to the voting booths. There were candidates' 
observers present at practically all election precincts in the 
oblast center. Most of them behaved properly, watching the 
proceedings and not interfering with the process of voting. 
Unfortunately, there were some unpleasant excesses. The 
authorized representatives of one of the candidates grabbed a 
stack of ballots and tore them up, and also opened the ballot 
box on their own. There also have been instances of illegal 
agitation in front of election precincts. The Procuracy is 
looking into all this now. 
  Dutch observers did not see the elections in as favorable a 
light as Mr. Steve Lane did. They saw a violation of the 
democratic process in the fact that invitations had been 
delivered to voters' homes. As well as in that 3,000 signatures 
were required for a candidate's registration rather than only 
the 10 in their country. The Dutch were also puzzled, to put it 
mildly, by monotonous propaganda leaflets, which, they said, are 
boring to read. There were many other comments, which will be 
discussed. Now the data from rayon elections continues to flow 
into the oblast electoral commission; they are sorted out and 
analyzed. It is hard to tell at this point how many candidates 
from which party or public movement will win parliamentary seats. 
  Overall, in Yuzhnyy Kazakhstan Oblast the voter turnout was 
79.8 percent. 
<H5>  UST-KAMENOGORSK </H5>
  Literally on the eve on 7 March, in election precinct No. 
38, 
the registration of M. Kozlov, a candidate for Supreme Council 
deputy, was overturned by a court ruling for violating the 
Election Code. The ballots with his name were already in the 
precincts, however. Therefore, the name of the failed candidate 
had to be struck out as bulletins were issued to voters, which, 
naturally, caused incomprehension and indignation. Some voters 
in protest struck out all candidate names on the ballot--both 
for the Supreme Council and for local bodies of representative 
power. 
  M. Kozlov probably has himself and his team to blame for 
what 
happened. Having made a last-minute mistake, they gave rivals an 
opening to put them out of the game, which is what the latter 
did. This is a lesson that in an election campaign one cannot 
relax till the very end. Nobody can count on greenhouse 
conditions these days. Those times have gone irretrievably into 
the past. 
<H5>  AKMOLA </H5>
  According to the oblast electoral commission data, 76.1 
percent of the residents in the Ishim virgin lands area 
participated in Supreme Council elections. 
  Overall, elections proceeded calmly, although there have 
been 
a few excesses. 
  "Most trouble came from observers," explained R. Koval, 
chairman of the Akmolinsk Oblast electoral commission. "By 
decision of the central electoral commission, the deadline for 
candidates to file an application to field observers was 21 
February. They did not do it in time. The deadline was extended 
to 3 March. And still, many candidates scrambled only on 
election day." 
  There were a total of 361 observers monitoring elections in 
Akmolinsk Oblast, including British citizen Mr. Nigel Butler, 
who has already served as an observer in Romanian, Russian, and 
African states. 
  Having said that it is against his principles to criticize 
the electoral system of another state, Nigel Butler nevertheless 
noted a number of insignificant but violations nevertheless that 
have been observed in the course of elections. Among them are 
incidents of some voters casting ballots not just for themselves 
but also for family members; filling out ballots outside the 
voting booth; and the shortage of booths. 
  Nor was Nigel Butler satisfied with the quality of work of 
local observers who, as he put it, mostly just sat at a distance 
instead of watching the course of elections. 
<H5>  KZYL-ORDA </H5>
  The results of elections to the oblast maslikhat were 
interesting and even unexpected. Of seven SNEK [expansion not 
given], Kzyl-Orda residents elected six. Four seats in the 
oblast maslikhat went to representatives of the Azat civic 
movement, three, to members of the Socialist Party, and one, to 
the Republican Party. Representatives of the People's Congress 
of Kazakhstan see their two seats as a defeat. 
  Judging by the results, it looks like Kzyl-Orda residents do 
not particularly trust parties and movements: 19 mandates went 
to candidates not affiliated with any parties. This is something 
for party and movement activists to contemplate.

Todorova: "Central Electoral Commission Chairman Is Satisfied 
With the Election Campaign"] 
  [Text] "The elections in Kazakhstan are an accomplished 
fact," was the solemn opening phrase of Central Electoral 
Commission [CEC] Chairman Karatay Turysov at the press 
conference on 7 March. 
  By 1700, 58 percent of Kazakhstan residents had turned out 
at 
election precincts. And the CEC could now be firmly confident 
that the republic population would not boycott such an important 
political campaign as elections to the Supreme Council and to 
maslikhats. Subsequent statistics confirmed this optimistic 
prognosis: By not yet final data, 73.84 percent of the 
Kazakhstan residents took part in the elections; in the capital, 
this figure stood at 62.59 percent. 
  Nature attempted to make its negative adjustments to the 
course of elections: In the north, it was unseasonably bitter 
cold; the south and west were hit by snowstorms. Activists from 
district and precinct commissions, assured the CEC chief, 
countered the weather with a high degree of organization, aided 
by modern communications. For instance, it was decided to 
transmit the preliminary results of voting at the remote animal 
husbandry pastures by radio telephone. 
  A high degree of organization in the course of election 
campaign was noted, according to the CEC chairman, by numerous 
foreign observers as well. 
  Of course, the question arose regarding violations recorded 
in the course of both election campaign and the elections. 
  "I do not see grounds for great concern," said Karatay 
Turysov, in this connection. "Shortcomings and snags always 
happen in such a major undertaking. There have been no major 
incidents in the republic." 
  As to "minor incidents," the head of the chief electoral 
body 
sees the cause as being that both the candidates and some 
district commissions did not comply with the provisions of the 
Electoral Code. As is known, the Supreme Council brought 
different level administrations into organizing the elections. 
And in this, even the watchful CEC had trouble distinguishing 
where the local administrations' direct duties ended and direct 
abuse began. Where the violations were obvious, electoral 
bodies' sanctions followed: warning, withdrawal of registration. 
Or, vice versa, actions to protect contenders for deputy 
mandates. Six candidates have been restored in their rights by a 
direct CEC decision. Some "eliminated" candidates for deputies 
have not succeeded in going all the distance in their appeals: 
Election day found some in the corridors of the Supreme Court, 
and some, of the Constitutional Court. The Karaganda procurator 
decided to invalidate election results in those districts where 
the code had been violated in the process of candidate 
nomination. 
  "As a CEC chairman, I am satisfied with the election 
campaign," said Karatay Turysov in conclusion. "I believe that 
under any circumstances we will have a highly professional 
parliament!" 
  The CEC promises to make public the final results of the 
vote 
and the names of deputies in our new parliament on 14 March.

Kaleyeva: "A Rich Spectrum of... Violations"] 
  [Text] From the early morning of 9 March, complaints on 
numerous violations of electoral procedures began to flow to the 
republic's Central Electoral Commission [CEC] and the editorial 
offices. 
  These violations are so diverse that merely listing them may 
create an impression of chaos; therefore, let us try to sort 
them out systematically. 
  I will begin with the point that is not a direct violation 
of 
the Electoral Code, but had a substantial impact on the results 
of the vote. Ballots have been printed in only one 
language--either Kazakh or Russian. Those who do not speak both 
languages immediately found themselves in a quandary: There are 
many names, quite often unknown, and there is no way to find out 
who they are, where, and in what capacity they work. Choices 
were being made on the basis of nicer sounding names, lucky 
numbers, and other accidental attributes. 
  Handing to the voters the ballots with the names of 
candidates running on a state slate, electoral commission 
members frequently explained: "In this, you need to leave two 
names." What they should have said is not "need" but "may": You 
may leave two names out of three. Most likely, this wording was 
used without giving a thought to the nuances of its meaning; 
nevertheless, what we have is hidden propaganda on the day of 
elections, that is, a direct violation of the rules. There is no 
need to name specific addresses: This observation applied almost 
everywhere. 
  A serious and very widespread violation of the electoral law 
was the so-called "family vote," where one person cast ballots 
for two, three, even six persons. The CEC and district 
commissions' leadership explained many times in advance that 
such practice is a thing of the past; now there is a strict 
rule--one person, one vote. Perhaps not all voters comprehended 
this rule, but electoral commission members should have... 
  A gross violation of the law was noted by observers in 
Aksayskiy and Aynabulakskiy districts in Almaty. The law 
requires that after the voting, before ballot boxes are opened, 
unused ballots be carefully counted and canceled. This was not 
done at these districts' precincts. This creates a tremendous 
opportunity for gross lawlessness: having found a moment when 
nobody is looking, one can fill out the ballots any way one 
likes--according to one's own preferences or with direction from 
above. It is possible that uncanceled ballots have indeed 
remained unused, but where is the guarantee? 
  A glaring violation of the law was recorded in precincts No. 
303 and No. 306 of the same Aynabulakskiy District No. 10: Close 
to the time of vote counting, there appeared "additional" ballot 
boxes, full of ballots, that were unregistered and had not been 
sealed in the morning. Where from? 
  Advance votes by students provided great opportunity for 
violations: In a number of precincts it began as early as 4 
March, since heads of higher education schools decided to let 
their wards go home for holidays... 
  This is the very first data from the capital. We should 
apparently expect complaints from other oblasts in the republic 
at a later date--according to preliminary information, there are 
quite a few such facts there as well. So it looks like we will 
be talking about these elections for quite a while: Most likely, 
there will be claims filed with all sorts of judiciary offices, 
requesting the invalidation of election results.

<F P=106> [Report by an unidentified KAZTAG correspondent: "Western </F>
Observers Disagree With Assessment of Organization and Conduct 
of Elections in Kazakhstan"] 
  [Text] Elections in Kazakhstan were accompanied by numerous 
gross violations of the procedure of expressing citizens' free 
will. This was the conclusion, for instance, of observers from 
the delegation of the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the 
International Electoral Systems Foundation, and a number of 
far-abroad countries that monitored the course of the election 
campaign and elections in the republic. 
  In their opinion, violations mainly boil down to 10 points. 
First and foremost, the republic's current system of candidate 
registration is complex. They note vagueness and a lack of 
concrete points in the programs of many contenders for deputy 
mandates, and their poor coverage in the local mass media. Among 
shortcomings impermissible for pluralistic democratic elections 
they also named one person voting for himself and relatives, 
bringing ballot boxes home to some voters, and the absence of 
guards at some election precincts. 
  Foreign representatives also complained that they were not 
permitted to visit a number of restricted-access election 
precincts. From which it follows, according to them, that this 
provided an opportunity for various forgeries and machinations. 
  To find out the reaction of the Central Electoral Commission 
[CEC], we turned to its chairman, Karatay Turysov, and asked him 
to comment on these and other allegations of foreign observers. 
The answer was: They are all being carefully checked out now and 
appropriate explanations on this subject are forthcoming. 
  I personally, noted K. Turysov, am not inclined to overly 
dramatize the situation. We have to base the assessment of 
elections on current realities in Kazakhstan; to ignore them is 
to take a deliberately biased position. Take, for instance, 
voting by a state list. This procedure is built into the 
Electoral Code, which had been adopted by the self-disbanded 
Supreme Council, and ignoring it would be a direct violation of 
the current law. The same could be said about elections in some 
military units. Existing security procedures for protection of 
state secrets do not permit letting foreign observers enter 
special secret defense installations. But voting there was 
conducted under the personal supervision of members of district 
electoral commissions. 
  By the way, many other foreign observers, who take a more 
realistic position, are well aware of this. In particular, those 
from France, Russia, Turkmenistan, and a number of other 
countries. For instance, the French Ambassador Plenipotentiary 
and Extraordinary Bertrand Fessard de Foukalt in a personal 
conversation with me characterized the organization and the 
initial results of elections as a clear success of the young 
Kazakh democracy.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Shchipanov: "Did Nazarbayev Spoil the </F>
`Russian Question?' We Promise To Thin Out the Pantheon of Our 
Political Bohemia in the Near Future"] 
  [Text] There is every reason to suppose that our extremely 
mobile public opinion will clash in the near future with the 
failure of still another perestroyka legend--the legend about 
the wise reformer and spontaneous democrat, the great friend of 
free Russia, Nursultan Nazarbayev. By nickname "the red emir." 
It is always extremely unpleasant to part with legends. 
Expecially against our background of massive disappointments in 
simple, but radical decisions, the aspiration to the panacea of 
a firm label. But it is simply necessary to understand from 
where the legend about Nazarbayev came. 
  However, for the beginning it is nevertheless necessary to 
understand in how far our prophets, who in spite of the 
well-known parable have multiplied chock-full in our Homeland, 
are so inconsistent. To illustrate, we will take two political 
figures, who at various times have caused a considerable stir in 
Russian minds--General Pinochet and the lawyer Zhirinovsky. Both 
of them have been treated as fascists without any special 
reasons, since neither the one nor the other in a strict sense 
meets the classic national-socialist definitions. But the 
essence is not to be found in this disappointing 
misunderstanding. 
  The embarrassment lies in the fact that the same eloquent 
prophets, artists at heart, whom from the moment of safe 
glasnost they invited to the Russian throne of their own 
Pinochet, called upon to cut with a dexterous stroke, in a fully 
Chilean manner, all the knots tied by the communists, have 
fallen into despair, abusing their own "people as not yet mature 
for democracy", having seen in parliament Zhirinovskiy with his 
falcons. It would seem, they conjured up a fascist a la Augusto 
Pinochet--and a fascist, according to their definition, they 
received, but instead of gladness--vulgar language. Or are no 
two fascists alike? There are fascists who are ours and who are 
not ours. 
  The problem, of course, lies elsewhere. In the example of V. 
V. Z. [Zhirinovskiy] it has become quite evident that many of 
our creators of public political theories and images do not 
think with arguments and concepts, but with models so to speak, 
they put external sympathies higher than logic and concrete 
knowledge. Strictly speaking, there would not be anything 
surprising in this since Bohemians have started to come out into 
political boundaries in the garbs of prophets, and recent 
theater critics--have made their debut in the capacity of 
newspaper political scientists. . . A whole direction of thought 
has arisen which can be fully defined as political Bohemianism. 
The legend of N. Nazarbayev can be explained precisely as by the 
views of this stratum. 
  In the case with Nazarbayev, the image of the progressive 
ruler, established during the epoch of the ecstasy of 
perestroyka, completely concealed the real state of affairs in 
Kazakhstan for many Russian lovers of political literature. To 
this day, many in Moscow are prepared to close their eyes to the 
openly authoritarian order of the republic with the blue flag 
and the absence there of--in the Gaydar sense--real economic 
reforms, to the national socialism that is gathering force 
there, and the edge aimed against the Russian community. And 
Nazarbayev is forgiven a great deal because he is. . . 
Nazarbayev. 
  Naturally, Nazarbayev gained a great deal from the fact 
that, 
at the moment of the collapse of the Union, he was already a 
well-known and recognizable politician. He had enough intellect 
if only to follow in the wake of Gorbachev, but to keep his 
distance, giving rise to rumors of an independence unknown in 
the Union. That mask of the independent "perestroyka-politician" 
helped Nazarbayev in the beginning to avoid the Gorbachev trap 
of the vice presidency, and then not to go to the bottom with 
the retinue of the last general secretary. 
  The Belovezhsk Agreements became the first strike at the 
prestige of the "red emir." On the one hand, he was shown his 
place, not even having been informed about the plans of the 
Slavs. But on the other, it was incredibly comfortable for 
Nazarbayev behind the cracked walls of the USSR. Nursultan 
Abishevich, earlier than the other colleagues from Central Asia, 
understood that an Eastern ruler in of his own accord is of 
little interest without the magical power of the Union looming 
behind his back. And the state of the union's 
semi-disintegration made it possible for Nazarbayev once more to 
"shine," coming out with his own initiatives for the 
reconciliation of the center and the republics. Taking into 
consideration the fact that even President Bush at that moment 
was an opponent of the liquidation of the empire, the mediator 
Nazarbayev collected points in the larger world game: He was 
recognized and well remembered. And the longer the period of 
semi-disintegration would last, the more of the residues of the 
might and authority of the Union would be "privatized" by the 
Kazakh, who had understood the methods of Shevardnadze very 
well. But Shevardnadze at this moment had virtually departed 
into non-existence and all the laurels went to Nazarbayev. For 
this reason, the rapid disintegration of the Union became for N. 
A. N. [Nazarbayev] the strongest personal defeat. In the 
economic sense, he already did not add anything to it, in the 
political sense, the losses were obvious. 
  Vague and temporizing was Nazarbayev's position during the 
days of August 1991, but he left the Union with an international 
reputation of a politician of wise, balanced and open reforms. 
The latter circumstance, strictly speaking, in no way assumed 
concrete form. But the image is really more precious than money. 
Somehow in the bustle it was forgotten that the liberation of 
prices, already widely announced, was held back precisely at the 
insistence of Nazarbayev, and to this day it is unclear what the 
cost of the ultimatum of the "reformer" of Russia was. 
  Later the insurance policy of its own natural resources 
mitigated for Kazakhstan, in contrast to some of the other 
post-Soviet republics, the burden of the transition period, and 
the interest of Western investors in the power of Nazarbayev was 
hastily proclaimed as the best proof of the effectiveness of the 
reforms begun under his wise leadership. About the policy which 
so actively fought for the formation of the CIS nothing bad 
could be written at all. Either good, or not all. 
  Meanwhile Nazarbayev understood one indisputable truth: What 
concerns Western investors is not his passion for reform and not 
even state democracy (naturally democratic proprieties must be 
observed), but only political stability. 
  And as a result, the simple goal of stability began to 
justify any means: The suppression of any free thinking, 
suppression of the press, the pleasing of Kazakhstan's own 
nationalists, the forcible change of the demographic situation, 
and bans even on national-cultural autonomy. Nursultan 
Abishevich drew conclusions from yesterday's masochism of his 
Russian colleagues, who for the past 2 years, as it were, 
specially tested their own fate, discussing abroad the threats 
of the red-browns, apparently not being aware that in so doing 
they merely decrease the chances for capital investments from 
the outside. Nazarbayev, on the contrary, quite in the Soviet 
manner, likes to talk about the unity of the people of 
Kazakhstan. 
  But precisely here the "Russian question"--the fate of the 
Kazakhstan Slavs, who constitute nearly 40 percent of the 
republic's population--presents a special danger for the 
building of the Nazarbayev prosperity. The slightest allusion to 
the coming aggravation of inter-nationality relations in the 
"red emirate", threatening unprecedented shocks--and the 
ephemeral reformist curtain, put up with such oriental art by 
Nazarbayev, simply comes tumbling down. The projects of the 
century will remain unrealized, but the king (more 
correctly--"emir") risks turning out to be naked. The 
laughing-stock for all. 
  The realization of such an indisputable fact during the past 
several months is clearly obscuring Nazarbayev's reason. 
Meanwhile the crisis in his relations with the Kremlin is slowly 
ripening. Strictly speaking, Nazarbayev received the first 
strike from Russia at the moment of the breakdown of the de 
facto ruble space. Not having received the requested supplies of 
Russian rubles of the new pattern, Nazarbayev, the "successful 
reformer," was deprived of one of the bases of his ostentatious 
economic prosperity--permanent Russian subsidies. The time of 
prosperity was over. 
  Since that time, Nazarbayev and Yeltsin have practically not 
had a single personal meeting. Even during the CIS summit 
meetings. Recently in Ashkhabad Nazarbayev found the possibility 
to meet and talk tete a tete even with Leonid Makarovich 
[Kravchuk], but by no means with Boris Nikolayevich. Nazarbayev 
with all his might is demonstrating his dissatisfaction with the 
policy of Moscow, which has revealed, with some delay, the 
millions of our own compatriots in the outlying districts of the 
former empire. A new turn for Nazarbayev for the demonstration 
of character is the problem of dual citizenship for Russians, 
who by the will of fate have unexpectedly turned out to be 
emigrants. 
  And here Nazarbayev displayed a for a refined and variegated 
oriental ruler unprecedented inflexibility. His unbending "No" 
clearly troubled Andrey Kozyrev, who with all his might tried to 
observe diplomatic etiquette. Moreover, Nazarbayev not only 
himself does not allow his Slavic subjects to adopt a second 
Russian citizenship, but he also is among those who are now 
exerting pressure on A. Akayev, who has already given his assent 
to the Russian proposal. Why is Nazarbayev so confused by the 
specter of a second passport among his fellow citizens who are 
residents of Kazakhstan? Is it not because the queues in front 
of the Russian embassy better than anything else tell about the 
real achievements of his regime? 
  The introduction of dual citizenship clearly does not suit 
Nazarbayev for two reasons. First of all, the very logic of 
authoritarianism does not leave the subjects (we are not talking 
about citizens) room for maneuver. It is no secret that not only 
Russians are aspiring to Russian citizenship everywhere, but 
many "aboriginals"--titular nations. The classic example is 
Armenia. Secondly, dual citizenship, under any propagandistic 
orders, is the acknowledgement of national trouble, smouldering 
behind the smiles of Nursultan Abishevich. Of the indirect 
support of the "Russian question," an act whose existence can 
mine the "system of Nazarbayev." This, the "red emir", who 
counted on the attractive, painted curtain of complete political 
and ethnic stability, cannot allow under any circumstances. The 
comedy of masks must be continued as long as possible. For the 
time being, large dollar flows are not coming into Kazakhstan. 
Well, and then, as, evidently, they count on in the entourage of 
the "emir." The West, having become the hostage of its own 
money, will be forced to support any eccentricities of the ruler. 
  However, it is not enough for Nazarbayev simply to refuse 
the 
Russian proposal for the introduction of the institution of dual 
citizenship. It is extremely necessary for him to receive 
directly from the Kremlin the assurance that no "Russian 
question" of any kind exists in the Kazakhstan subordinated to 
his will. There cannot be because there can never be one! And 
this is why, as people in the know assert, Nazarbayev 
demonstratively procrastinates with the long ago announced 
personal meeting with his colleague Yeltsin, trying to attain, 
they say, from the Russian president public confirmation of the 
"inter-nationality purity" of the policy of Nursultan 
Abishevich. To go for such a concession to Nazarbayev would be a 
strategic error for Yeltsin. Especially in the present 
conditions, when even for the defense of the far-away Serbs, the 
parliamentarians are ready to become a friendly and inviolable 
wall. 
  And for this reason, one can expect from Nazarbayev in the 
near future unexpected unfriendly improvisations with respect to 
Russia. It is not out of the question that the "red emir" will 
blame some of his domestic difficulties on the intrigues of 
Moscow and simply Moscow inflexibility. Variations are possible. 
But one thing is obvious, many in Moscow will have to part with 
illusions regarding the wise and just oriental ruler. 
  P.S. Incidentally, already in America Nazarbayev cautioned 
against the extension of assistance basically to Russia, whose 
policy is becoming increasingly more rigid in relation to the 
so-called near abroad. H.A.N. [Nazarbayev] wisely counseled to 
support Moscow depending on its faithfulness to democracy. 
Whoever's cow would moo, and Nazarbayev's goat. . .

<F P=106> [Interview with Abdudzhalil Samadov, chairman of the Council </F>
of Ministers of Tajikistan, by ITAR-TASS observer Yuriy Sizov 
specially for OBSHCHAYA GAZETA; place and date not given: "We 
Are Condemned to Success Only Together With Russia"] 
  [Text] [Sizov] How did your negotiations in Moscow end up? 
What prospects are there for the development of bilateral 
Russian-Tajik relations? 
  [Samadov] We very quickly found with the Government of 
Russia 
an understanding of the problems that we have encountered in 
1994. These problems ensue primarily from a combination of three 
very complex processes: political transformations in the 
Republic of Tajikistan connected with the adoption of the new 
constitution; a referendum to determine the form of government; 
the preparation of free elections with the participation of all 
Tajiks, wherever they may be, and all Tajikistanis who 
acknowledge the laws of the country. Having conducted a series 
of intensive negotiations with the top leadership of the Russian 
Government and with leading ministers, we leave with confidence 
that the understanding that was reached will be realized in 
specific mechanisms and concrete actions on both sides. 
  I would like to mention that our government has embarked on 
the path of a broader dialogue with all structures of the 
Russian state and Russian intellectuals. We are treating with 
sufficient responsibility the task of realization in 1994 of the 
intergovernmental agreement between Tajikistan and Russia. 
  A group of Russian specialists left for Tajikistan together 
with me, and will help us look into the financial system, the 
economy of the enterprises, and the economy of the regions. 
  It would seem to me that the task the government is setting, 
which met with understanding at this stage, let us say, must be 
accomplished. I would formulate this task as follows: the 
unprecedented activity of Russian business circles, Russian 
business, Russian politicians, and Russian scientists in 
Tajikistan. 
  Tajikistan today is quite an intricate knot of very topical, 
interesting problems and a fertile field of application for 
foreign investments. But why should the share of Russian capital 
not be more significant here? Why en route to the formation of 
stock companies from the enterprises, which were once built on 
the basis of Russian technology, can we not create new forms of 
the organization of these works via the formation of 
international stock companies? 
  [Sizov] You have emphasized repeatedly that a principal 
cause 
of the crisis situation of the national economy is the mass 
exodus of highly skilled specialists from Tajikistan, 
Russian-speaking specialists included. How do you intend to 
resolve this problem? 
  [Samadov] I would like first of all to evaluate this problem 
as such. Many Tajiks have left the republic also. If we are to 
be objective, this has led in practice to the incapability of 
many structures. Once, back in the phase of discussion of the 
law on the official language in Tajikistan, I said that this 
process could not be approached airily, with the emphasis on 
national self-awareness and the need for its upsurge and 
revival. It is impossible to enter the 21st century in isolation 
from the world and without tackling such problems as, say, 
information support in the sphere of new technology, research, 
production, the organization of production, international 
relations, and so forth. I believe that the failure to 
understand many such circumstances led to this process 
beginning. I believe that the political stability of Tajikistan 
is the first and main condition of a return of the departed 
specialists. Another problem: We need to solve in a new way and 
fundamentally the question of their remuneration and the 
protection of their interests in Tajikistan. And the government 
is now tackling this problem. 
  [Sizov] Unless I am mistaken, there are now over 20 million 
Tajiks in the world, and 5 million live in your republic, but 
the republic is multinational. For example, over 1.5 million 
Uzbeks live with you also. How are your relations shaping up 
today with neighboring Uzbekistan? 
  [Samadov] From its first steps our government has managed to 
direct these relations into the constructive channel of mutual 
understanding. As far as the Tajik and Uzbek peoples are 
concerned, I am sure that, considering the age-old historical 
relations on the vast expanse of Central Asia, these relations 
cannot be hostile, and all attempts to provoke an exacerbation 
of these relations will be cut short. 
  [Sizov] In the course of the top-level Ashgabat meeting of 
heads of state of the CIS the question of the peacekeeping 
mission of Russia and Commonwealth countries on the Tajik-Afghan 
border was discussed also. How might you now, two months on, 
characterize the situation on the border and the role of the 
peace-keeping force? 
  [Samadov] It is hard to exaggerate its role. It is truly a 
very powerful stabilizing factor. I have to say a word of 
gratitude primarily to the government, the top statesmen, and 
the president of Russia for the attention they are giving a 
resolution of this problem. We know that in the spring of 1994 
certain forces will begin to muster on the other side for a more 
large-scale penetration of the territory of Tajikistan. It is 
not enough to say that we have the forces to resist. It is 
essential to intensify the political dialogue, including with 
representatives of the opposition who want peaceful development 
in Tajikistan and a peaceful solution of the problems that have 
risen to confront the republic. We need to start this as early 
as possible, without waiting for some period of time and without 
putting forward prior conditions, having included in this 
process, of course, international organizations, primarily the 
United Nations, and also, undoubtedly, Russia and the countries 
of Central Asia. Our government is prepared to do everything 
necessary for the start of this process. 
  [Sizov] Last winter, when the question of the possibility or 
impossibility of dialogue with the forces of the opposition was 
raised, the leadership of Tajikistan adopted a guarded attitude 
toward this and held back even from such negotiations in the 
long term. Do you believe that time is dictating different 
conditions, and is a dialogue with those who truly are for the 
democratic path of Tajikistan's development possible? 
  [Samadov] The last phrase is the key. The government is 
prepared to negotiate with those who are for a democratic path 
of the development of Tajikistan. These forces today call 
themselves the opposition. Opposition to what? Some 
personalities in the government? Their own state? The policy of 
the government or the path for which this government is opting? 
Here is a subject for negotiations. I repeat that we need 
without any prior conditions to agree to facilitate by joint 
efforts the complex political, economic, and social processes of 
integration that are already occurring in Tajikistan in 1994. 
  [Sizov] As we all know, there is a major uranium deposit in 
the north of Tajikistan, which enabled us formerly to create the 
"nuclear shield." There have come to be reports in the news 
media that Tajikistan would possibly be prepared to sell the 
uranium raw material to countries of the Arab world, Iran has 
been cited also. Do you not think that some people are pushing 
Tajikistan into playing the "uranium card"? 
  [Samadov] There are no people in our government or in 
today's 
leadership of the republic of Tajikistan, I believe, who suffer 
from such a disease. I am convinced that the process of the sale 
of the uranium, which is monitored by the appropriate 
international organizations, produced on the territory of the 
republic will be precisely as it has been thus far. I state that 
all attempts to link Tajikistan with countries aspiring to 
include it in the development of their uranium programs, other 
than the countries with which we have a stable relationship in 
this sphere, primarily Russia, are groundless. These attempts 
have no political prospects.

<F P=106> [Interview with Otakhon Latifi, chairman of the board of the </F>
Coordinating Center of Democratic Forces of Tajikistan in the 
CIS, by Marina Pavlova-Silvanskaya; place and date not given: 
"The Negotiations Must Not Be Dragged Out"] 
  [Text] [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] Reports have appeared in the 
press concerning contacts between officials from Dushanbe and 
representatives of the opposition living in Moscow. What does 
this mean--steps toward one another, a feeling out of the ground 
for negotiations? 
  [Latifi] The official authorities of Tajikistan have yet to 
declare their readiness for negotiations. Officials are meeting 
one on one, but without authority, as private individuals. A 
group of high-ranking officials came here recently in the hope 
of winning the return of the refugees. This was the second such 
attempt, both ended in failure. Given the approach employed by 
the emissaries of Dushanbe officialdom, this is not surprising. 
For example, K. Kaimdodov, deputy chairman of the Supreme 
Council, granted an interview to INTERFAX, in which (oh, simple 
soul!) he complained: Field work will soon be starting in the 
countryside, there is a shortage of manpower, and the refugees 
must for this reason return. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What is the opposition's attitude 
toward the prospect of negotiations? 
  [Latifi] We have always advocated negotiations. And the 
first 
step toward them, in our view, should be a meeting and 
agreements with the leadership of Russia, we recognize Russia's 
place in "big" geopolitics in the region also. We understand 
that it is very difficult to solve any questions within the 
former USSR, whatever it is now called, without Russia. But we 
see no mediating activity on the part of Russia as yet, 
unfortunately. Two institutions have been created in Russia for 
a resolution of the Tajik problem. The first is the 
interdepartmental commission chaired by A. Adamishin, deputy 
minister of foreign affairs. It has been in existence for quite 
some time, but has not met since last November. 
  The second is the Tajik settlement mission, which was 
established in November by an edict of B. Yeltsin and is headed 
by Ambassador-at-Large A. Oblov. I have met with him three times 
and fully share his view of the need for a general--regional, 
political, interethnic--settlement in Tajikistan. We agreed for 
the time being not to notify the press of the contacts. But the 
agreement has to be broken. The Foreign Ministry is patently 
dragging out a settlement. We, on the other hand, believe that 
the process should be accelerated. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What is forcing you to hurry? 
  [Latifi] With the arrival of spring the development of 
events 
could assume a catastrophic nature. The passes and roads will be 
opened, and everything will be on the move. Colonel General B. 
Pyankov, commander of the collective peacekeeping force, who 
expressed serious concern at the state of affairs in Tajikistan, 
was in Moscow recently. When even the military believes that 
without negotiations with the opposition a catastrophe is 
inevitable, this speaks volumes. We need to listen to the sober 
voice of the army. If an escalation of the conflict begins, the 
war could, according to the forecasts of independent experts, 
carry over to Uzbekistan in connection with the fact that mass 
privatization has now begun there and tension has increased. All 
of Central Asia could flare up, and moreover, a Central Asian 
arc of war could interface with the Caucasus war. There would 
then be a great conflagration, about which we warned in our last 
statement. 
  This is why the opposition is in a hurry to begin 
negotiations, to come to an agreement with Russia primarily. A 
statement addressed to President B. Yeltsin, Prime Minister V. 
Chernomyrdin, and the Federal Assembly has been published. We 
appeal to the Russian public also. It should be recognized that 
there will be no reforms in Russia and Russia itself even could 
explode unless the arc of fire in the south is put out in time. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What, in your view, are the reasons 
for 
the procrastination over negotiations? 
  [Latifi] They could be various: a desire to profit from the 
arms trade, for example, and also the voluntary or involuntary 
playing into the hands of the Tashkent regime. The latter is all 
but openly helping General Dostum in Afghanistan, an Uzbek by 
nationality. His deputy, General Aizi, declared plainly in an 
interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA that his supporters were 
seeking to oust President Rabbani inasmuch as he is a Tajik. 
Just about half the population of Afghanistan is composed of 
Tajiks. The calculation, evidently, is that, after they have 
been suppressed in Afghanistan, Tajikistan could be pulled to 
pieces also and that it would disappear as an independent state. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] So the first step toward a settlement 
should be, from your viewpoint, an official meeting of 
representatives of the opposition and Ambassador A. Oblov to 
discuss the conditions of the achievement of peace in 
Tajikistan. And how do you see the further development of events? 
  [Latifi] The opposition devised its plan of action on 7 
December of last year at the meeting in Tehran. It is set forth 
in the special document "Proposals for a Peaceful Settlement of 
the Military-Political Conflict in the Republic of Tajikistan," 
which was transmitted to the Ministry of Defense of Russia, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Office of the President. 
Via N. Nazarbayev and S. Niyazov the contents of the document 
were conveyed to the heads of state of the CIS. It was also sent 
to Butrus-Ghali and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, 
and Afghanistan. 
  Responding to our proposals, Ambassador Ramiro Paris-Ballon, 
the new representative of the UN secretary general, flew to 
Moscow. He is now actively trying to get the Tajiks to the 
negotiating table and has even traveled to Dushanbe and Gordnyy 
Badakhshan for this. We met twice: before and after the trip. It 
was proposed that the agenda of the negotiations consist of 
three questions: 
  a political settlement of the situation in Tajikistan (which 
would include the creation of a State Council or Council of 
National Accord and also a provisional government made up of 
competent and neutral persons, an end to all the criminal 
proceedings instituted in connection with the political 
confrontation and the civil war, and the release of all persons 
in detention in this connection); 
  the disarmament and breakup of the so-called local 
self-defense force, armed detachments of the opposition, and 
special battalions of the MVD, National Security Committee, and 
Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan--formations in which the 
regime has as of late been registering on a general basis 
combatants from particular areas of the country (Kulyab, for 
example), providing them with a "legal roof." It is essential 
also to confiscate from the population weapons that are being 
held illegally; 
  refugees, who should be returned to their permanent places 
of 
residence--with a guarantee of safety and social protection, 
return of seized assets, and so forth. 
  We consider these three questions inseparable from one 
another. 
  Paris-Ballon agreed with the need for their inclusion on the 
agenda. He has now gone to New York and reported on the results 
of his talks to the UN leadership and several days ago he met in 
Tehran with leaders of the Islamic resistance of Tajikistan. He 
is to determine the budget of the mission and specify the 
location of future negotiations. 
  [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] You yourself speak about the 
possibility of an exacerbation of the situation by spring. It is 
obvious, therefore, that a settlement will require the presence 
of some peacekeeping contingents.... 
  [Latifi] Even the Russian military openly acknowledges as a 
commonly known fact that the regime in Dushanbe is holding on 
exclusively thanks to the presence of the Russian Army. Were it 
to leave, the authorities would not last a day even: They would 
be swept away. These politicians, who came to Dushanbe with the 
support of Russian tanks, have in a year conclusively wrecked 
the economy, having brought the people to the brink of 
starvation. 
  But we know that we cannot manage either today or tomorrow 
or 
the day after without Russia, and for this reason the problem of 
the presence of Russian military forces in Tajikistan has to be 
resolved. They could constitute the nucleus of a peacekeeping 
force, but, as A. Kozyrev and British Foreign Secretary D. Hurd 
say in a joint statement, Russia should for this obtain a UN 
mandate for peacekeeping activity. 
  UN standards would specify precisely what the "blue helmets" 
are entitled to do and what they are not. The arms also would be 
under supervision, international observers would inspect them. 
Otherwise--there are troops in the region, they will be the 
peacekeepers. Today they will support one party to the conflict, 
tomorrow, another. 
  We insist that the Tajik negotiations be conducted under the 
aegis of the United Nations. They need a serious guarantor, and 
their results need international recognition. Only then will the 
parties feel a sense of responsibility.

<F P=106> [Article by Armen Khanbabyan: "Building a National Army </F>
Hampers the Armenian Economy: The Head of the Cabinet Thinks 
That Ministers Should Not Be Envied"] 
  [Text] 
  Prime Minister of Armenia Grant Bagratyan held a press 
conference concerning the results of the current Cabinet of 
Ministers' year at the helm of executive authority. According to 
the premier, this year became the most difficult period for the 
national economy. Because of the permanent blockade, the volume 
of used resources fell at least by a factor of four, and the 
level of production of electric power also decreased. Last year 
Armenia, contrary to its desire, did not end up in the ruble 
zone, which also had an extremely negative effect on all aspects 
of life. The continuing confrontation in Karabakh and 
Azerbaijan's continuous efforts to draw Armenia into the 
conflict also had a serious effect on the economy. In this 
connection, the prime minister noted that today Baku is trying 
in fact to initiate a so-called war of resources, and this is 
compelling Armenia to devote increased attention to the 
formation and reinforcement of defense structures and to take 
the path of intensive building of the army, bringing its armed 
forces to the level permitted by international agreements; 
moreover, both in the sense of numbers and from the aspect of 
material-technical equipping. "If we were spending as much on 
defense today as at the beginning of 1992," declared the 
premier, "the standard of living in the republic would grow by 
75 percent immediately." 
  Despite these extremely unfavorable factors and regularly 
arising circumstances of force majeure (explosions in gas 
pipelines, and sabotage in various other infrastructures 
connecting Armenia with the outside world), the republic was in 
principle able to maintain the gross national product 
practically at the former level. While having less resources in 
1993 by a factor of four and producing less electric power by a 
factor of three, Armenian enterprises were able to provide more 
than 90 percent of the production of the 1992 level. In 
addition, in Bagratyan's opinion, it is a positive fact that a 
steady growth trend was observed in the course of the whole 
year--production seemed to be adjusting itself more and more to 
the conditions that were developing. This also became the reason 
for a phenomenon that was rather unexpected for many: According 
to the year's results, Armenia looks even better than the 
average for the CIS. In the words of the premier, galloping 
inflation was successfully reined in, and this slowed down 
somewhat what started to be a rapid drop in the standard of 
living of the people, as well as in the exchange rate of the 
national currency. Bagratyan is convinced that it was necessary 
from the very beginning to introduce not a fixed and firm rate 
of exchange of the dram, but a "floating" dram, which would have 
prevented the emergence of negative tendencies and would not 
have permitted the development of a shadow economy. In the words 
of the premier, it was precisely the correction of this error 
recently that made it possible to noticeably stabilize the dram, 
which today looks almost like a "super-hard currency," 
especially in comparison with the Georgian coupon or the 
Azerbaijani manat. The premier also assessed as positive the 
fact that Armenia had finally become a member of the 
international community of developing countries. In addition, he 
emphasized that in this regard it is not necessary to experience 
any negative emotions and that there should be no psychological 
bias against the term "developing states," since it was only 
recently that Israel and Singapore, whose economic potential 
needs no comment, were removed from the group of developing 
states. The most important problems that the premier mentioned 
as requiring resolution this year are the formation of the 
budget, perfection of tax policy, and stiffening of control over 
exports. As before, the situation is being influenced by the 
so-called Georgian problem, specifically, the delivery of 
commodities on the territory of the neighboring country. Just 
today, 5,000 tonnes of butter and 25,000 tonnes of rice 
belonging to Armenia were held up on the territory of Georgia. 
The usual difficulties with the delivery of grain arose, and the 
government is expending enormous forces and energy to ensure 
that purchased and already paid for foodstuffs are finally 
delivered to consumers. Moreover, Armenia today is forced to 
apply enormous efforts to ensure Georgia regularly receives its 
quota of gas. It is only this that makes it possible to hope 
that something will also get to Yerevan. There is no doubt that 
the war in Karabakh will continue to have a negative influence. 
"It is hoped," noted Grant Bagratyan, "that the complete failure 
of the winter campaign will be proof for Azerbaijan that it is 
impossible to solve the Karabakh problem through force." 
However, whatever is decided in Baku, whether to finally sit 
down at the negotiating table or to continue the war 
nevertheless, while at the same time counting on a war of 
resources--we are prepared for both variants in the development 
of events. 
  To the question of how the premier assesses the fact that 
the 
present government may soon break the record for remaining in 
power, Bagratyan noted that there is still a full month before a 
record is achieved, and that hasty statements should not be 
made. The ministries were permitted to work for a relatively 
long period, but it is not worth envying them, inasmuch as the 
members of the government have exhausted themselves mentally and 
physically. "If it were up to me, I would send all of them on a 
vacation of about six months. The people have earned this," 
declared the premier. Responding to a question concerning the 
prospects for a renewal of the work of the Armenian AES [nuclear 
power station], Grant Bagratyan emphasized that the negotiations 
conducted on this score in Moscow were quite beneficial. And 
today the Armenian side does not see any obstacles now to 
signing an agreement on converting the AES into a joint 
Armenian-Russian enterprise. The signing of such an agreement 
can be expected in the very near future. Moreover, Armenia hopes 
that the decision being prepared by European structures 
regarding the problem of nuclear power engineering in the CIS 
countries will also be positive, and in such an event it will be 
possible to hope for the extension of credits on the part of 
West European states.

<F P=106> [Report by G. N.: "State Administration for National </F>
Security Is Being Restructured"] 
  [Text] According to a decree issued by President Levon Ter 
Petrosyan on 14 January, Armenia's State Administration for 
National Security [SANS] will be reorganized. According to the 
decree, all functional services of the SANS have been disbanded 
and the activities of their staff have been terminated, though 
they will receive another 3 months of pay. The Main 
Administration for the Protection of State Borders as well as 
administrative, technical, financial-economic and medical 
services have been retained within the SANS structure. 
  Eduard Simonyants has been relieved of his duties as the 
head 
of the SANS. His functions will be performed by Davit 
Shahnazaryan who has been appointed as the acting chief of the 
Administration and who will continue to serve as the president's 
envoy on special assignments. Shahnazaryan has been assigned the 
responsibility to evaluate the SANS staff and to present to the 
government the bylaws and organizational structure of the 
administration within the next 3 months. 
  During a briefing yesterday, the president's press 
secretary, 
Aram Abrahamyan, noted in connection with the presidential 
decree on the restructuring of the SANS that the primary 
responsibilities of the Administration must be intelligence 
gathering and counterintelligence. He added that the 
Administration must undergo structural changes in order to 
perform those functions. According to Mr. Abrahamyan, the former 
structure was created during the Soviet period and served other 
purposes, mainly the pursuit of dissidents. Now that, according 
to the president's press secretary, there are no such problems 
in Armenia, the SANS services must concentrate on the issues 
mentioned: intelligence gathering and counterintelligence. 
  As for the issue of who heads the SANS, Mr. Abrahamyan 
stated 
that the envisaged restructuring is not at all related to the 
person of former chief Eduard Simonyants, whom the president 
holds in very high regard and whose capabilities will be 
utilized in other areas. 
  As is known, Eduard Simonyants is a petrochemist by training 
and entered the national security apparatus in 1990 as part of 
the president's team of national security advisers. In February 
1993 he was appointed chief of the SANS. As for how he became 
part of the national security apparatus, in Simonyants's words, 
there are few people today who have had much relevant training 
for their present jobs. That is what he declared in March 1993 
during a meeting with reporters. 
  Now, approximately 1 year after his appointment, the SANS is 
headed by a person who is equally inexperienced in national 
security work (or at least has no directly relevant experience 
in that field). 
  As is known, the new head of the SANS, Davit Shahnazaryan, 
is 
a physicist by training. He is the president's envoy on special 
assignments and has considerable experience in international 
mediation activities. 
  At one point Shahnazaryan was considered a contender for the 
position of the republic's foreign minister. With respect to his 
experience in national security bodies, the president's press 
secretary said at yesterday's briefing that what is important is 
not his experience but whether he has a clear political posture. 
Mr Abrahamyan cited as an example Minister of the Interior Vano 
Siradeghyan who also was not trained for or had experience in 
his domain of work. Mr Abrahamyan noted that the issue of 
restructuring the SANS has been under study for a long time and 
that, in his opinion, it must be run by a political appointee. 
  Did this lengthy study also include the issue of Eduard 
Simonyants as the SANS chief? 
  The 57-year-old former SANS chief declined to comment in any 
way on his dismissal during our short telephone conversation. 
When we asked him whether there were any specific grounds for 
his dismissal he answered in the negative. The only positive 
answer Mr Simonyants gave us was that he has genuinely been 
offered another position whose details he declined to provide. 
  Thus, Armenia's SANS is being restructured by a presidential 
decree. Let us recall that Russia's agency responsible for 
national security, the Ministry of National Security, has been 
restructured by President Boris Yeltsin's decree. Given that 
internal developments in Russia affect events in Armenia in one 
way or another, the restructuring of Armenia's SANS can, 
perhaps, also be tied to the reorganization of Russia's Ministry 
of National Security. Of course, one must add to that all the 
known and unknown causes and preceding events in Armenia, stated 
and unstated opinions about the restructuring of the SANS and 
one must not rule out any relationship to the resignation of the 
president's former national security adviser, Ashot Manucharyan. 
One must also take into account the fact that Eduard Simonyants 
is a "product of that blacksmith's shop."

  [Text] The president's 14 January decree "on the 
restructuring of State Administration for National Security of 
the Armenian Republic," whose purpose is to resolve the national 
security issues that stand before the Administration in 
conditions of independent statehood, has gone into effect. The 
radical restructuring of this agency has naturally attracted 
attention and interest. The ARMENPRES correspondent queried 
David Shahnazaryan, the acting head of the SANS, about the 
current activities of the regional divisions of the 
Administration. Mr Shahnazaryan stated that the president's 
decree terminated the activities of the functional services of 
only the central security apparatus and that the regional 
subdivisions are still continuing their work.

  [Text] As is known, Armenia's SANS was subjected to 
restructuring in accordance with the president's decree on 14 
January. Ashot Manucharyan, the president's former adviser on 
national security affairs, spoke about that measure during his 
press conference yesterday and described it as the work of the 
special services of countries hostile to Armenia. He came to 
that conclusion in the presence of reporters by "shattering" all 
official and unofficial theories published in the press. 
According to Manucharyan, the said decree practically 
annihilated the SANS and destroyed the network of agents and 
that this helps only the special services of hostile nations 
because the official measure--that is to suspend the 
Administration's work for 3 months and to certify its staff--is 
unacceptable. After all, he said, the staff could be certified 
without suspending their activities. Mr Manucharyan added that 
the said decree must definitely be reconsidered and that a 
special commission must be created to review the process by 
which that decision was taken and to find the culprits. He 
added: "The hostile hand must be found as soon as possible."

<F P=106> [Answers to reporters' questions by Minister of the Interior </F>
Vano Siradeghyan at press conference in Yerevan on 25 January] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] 
  [Question] What is your opinion regarding the dissolution of 
the SANS and the appointment of Davit Shahnazaryan [as acting 
SANS chief]? 
  [Siradeghyan] I know one thing with certainty: The 
dissolution of that agency can at least help the investigative 
bodies. The investigation of the assassination of [former 
Armenian KGB chief Marius] Yuzbashyan will now probably move 
forward. That agency was supposed to help in the investigation 
of that assassination but did nothing--indeed it "put it to 
sleep." An investigative team has been created which 
incorporates the Ministry of the Interior, the SANS and the 
prosecutor's office. One day after Yuzbashyan's burial, his 
wife--who was a SANS major--fled to Moscow. She is the last 
person who saw Yuzbashyan alive. It is still not known whether 
the wife offered any assistance. That investigation was frozen 
one day after Yuzbashyan's burial. I am deeply convinced that 
that "soyuzni" [allied] KGB (I do not say Armenia's KGB) purged 
its own former chief who knew much about the beginnings of the 
Karabakh movement and who knew many people. Let me also mention 
that Yuzbashyan was killed by a single shot, but several empty 
shells were left at the assassination site to give the 
impression that there were several shots. They killed Ashot 
Sargsyan with a single shot with the same skill, the same 
boldness and the same cowardice. Thus the dissolution of the 
SANS was essential. As for the appointment of Davit 
Shahnazaryan, let me say that for this work it was necessary to 
appoint a man in whom the president has full confidence. There 
was no other alternative. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Arsen Baghdasaryan: "Ashot Manucharyan's Fourth </F>
Return: The Mysterious Recluse Begins to Speak"] 
  [Text] It is a recurring pattern: Every time the situation 
in some important domain of the republic assumes critical 
proportions, Ashot Manucharyan returns--unexpectedly for 
some--to the political stage. This time, according to 
Manucharyan, the problem is that Karabakh will most probably be 
able to halt the enemy's massive offensive and achieve a 
breakthrough in the war's progress in the coming days and that 
it is very important that we achieve peace and not lose the 
favorable moment for a second time. During a press conference at 
the Armenian Republican Party's headquarters yesterday, 
Manucharyan called on parties, public and political 
organizations and others to work together and "to turn the wheel 
in the direction that is essential for us." He expressed the 
hope that the next 2 to 3 months will have a determining role in 
the achievement of peace. 
  Commenting on anticipated provocations, the former 
presidential advisor stated that a dignified solution must be 
found to the Karabakh problem and that one the requirements is 
that the people of Karabakh must have guarantees for its secure 
development and it must not be under anyone's rule. Mr 
Manucharyan said that this is the minimum requirement and did 
not rule out any situation which may be agreeable to Karabakh 
but which may not satisfy Armenia. Mr Manucharyan also commented 
on the CSCE and Russian peace efforts and stated that the latter 
incorporates mechanisms which make the resumption of military 
activities impossible but that it has many flaws. As for the 
well known proposal made by [Yeltsin adviser] Andranik 
Mihranyan, Mr Manucharyan said that that proposal is very close 
to Russia's general posture. 
  Having been deprived of the opportunity to ask questions to 
the mysterious politician for a long time, the reporters 
naturally tried to learn about his views on the government, the 
president and the Ministry of the Interior. It turns out that 
the former presidential adviser has a very low opinion of the 
government's work, that, in his opinion, the present government 
cannot rectify the situation and that it must be replaced by a 
new one. The Ministry of the Interior was the target of more 
severe criticisms: Mr Manucharyan said that that ministry "is 
out of control and not subject to authority." According to Mr 
Manucharyan, if this situation continues there will be nothing 
in the republic except the Ministry of the Interior. He 
criticized the Ministry of the Interior for contributing to the 
economic crisis and said that business people are fleeing the 
republic today because of the shadow taxes that ministry has 
imposed. With an expression of boyish amazement, Mr Manucharyan 
cited a few examples of how those shadow taxes operate. 
  Mr Manucharyan also criticized certain episodes of the 
president's foreign policy but declined to identify them 
because, in his words, they are related to state secrets and 
cannot be publicized.

<F P=106> [Report by Ashot Aghababyan: "Tangible Results of Preventive </F>
Measures: Minister of the Interior Vano Siradeghyan's Press 
Conference"] 
  [Excerpts] Before answering the reporters' questions at the 
press conference yesterday, Minister of the Interior Vano 
Siradeghyan summarized the work of his ministry with figures. 
  The total number of crimes in 1993 was 19 percent less than 
that for 1992. There was a 26-percent drop in criminal 
investigations. The number of intentional and attempted murders 
dropped by 13 percent, criminal acts resulting in bodily injury 
by 13.6 percent and thefts of state and public property by 65.5 
percent. The number of crimes committed in not clearly known 
circumstances declined by 32 percent. In 1993, 430 cases of use, 
possession and distribution of narcotics were uncovered. Of 
these, 47 cases involved narcotics sellers, all of whom are in 
jail. It can be said that all narcotics traffickers in Yerevan 
are in prison. The number of car thefts declined by 60.7 
percent. This was the result of better car security measures and 
the scarcity of gasoline. In 1993, 53 cases of circulating 
counterfeit currency (Russian rubles and American dollars) were 
uncovered, but the location of their printing presses has not 
been determined. Crimes in public areas declined by 37 percent. 
  Criminal offenses by juveniles (402 cases in 1993) and theft 
of private property are on the rise. The latter category has 
been growing steadily especially in the winter. No change has 
been observed in offenses committed by recidivists: 630 formerly 
convicted persons committed offenses again. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Rumors Not Serious </H5>
  [Question] There are rumors that there have been 
assassination attempts against you, that you are preparing to 
become prime minister and that you want to move to France. 
  [Siradeghyan] I said on one occasion that there are jocular 
rumors that I will be named prime minister but that these rumors 
are not taken so lightheartedly by the government. I have no 
aspirations for that office. As for my departure from Armenia, 
they have been talking about that for two years. Denying them 
every time may appear comical. At one time they said that we 
were giving Karabakh away. Did we? It is those same people who 
are spreading these rumors. Life and time have proven them 
wrong. All these must be taken with some humor. As for the 
assassination attempt, it is impossible to mount an 
assassination attempt against me. There is no man in Armenia who 
would want to do that. As for my going abroad, there is no place 
in the world I would like to go and live, unless they expel me 
from Armenia. It is more secure and easier to live here. Here I 
have relatives, brothers and friends. Do not take those rumors 
seriously. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Right To Carry Arms </H5>
  [Question] It is extremely dangerous to walk in the 
capital's 
streets at night. Is it not time to allow citizens to carry 
arms--at least gas pistols--for self-defense? 
  [Siradeghyan] I am convinced that the number of criminal 
offenses will drop if we allow citizens to carry arms. However, 
I oppose the idea of gas pistols when the other side has real 
pistols. With the approval of the collegium of our ministry I 
have allowed certain individuals to carry arms. In general, the 
people who are given such permits are individuals associated 
with government bodies and persons working for businesses and 
banks. However, the number of such persons is very small. Our 
ministry as well as the relevant committee of the Supreme 
Council and the prosecutor's office are drafting laws for 
private gun ownership. I am hopeful that the Supreme Council 
will enact that law this year. I think that citizens must be 
given the right to carry arms so that everyone knows that the 
other person may have a weapon. I consider that the primary 
preventive measure against crime. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Possible Coup Ruled Out </H5>
  [Question] Recently there has been talk about a possible 
coup 
d'etat. 
  [Siradeghyan] What do you think? Do you think that such a 
thing can happen in Armenia when Vazgen Sargsyan is the minister 
of state, Serzh Sargsyan is the minister of defense, I am the 
minister of the interior, and Samvel Babayan is the commander of 
the Karabakh forces? If you think that in Armenia there are even 
10 armed people outside of these structures, you are wrong. 
There are not. If there are please show me. A coup can be 
mounted only by the military structure if it joins forces with 
at least two of the structures I mentioned. Do not believe 
fables and boasts. There is no such force in Armenia. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of the Interior Vano Siradeghyan by </F>
correspondent Ida Martirosyan; date and place not specified] 
  [Excerpts] We know that the interview below by our 
correspondent will cause dissatisfaction among some of our 
readers. The questions that are posed with "sharp" propositions 
could have been further sharpened. They could rise above the 
level of rumors, probe deeper issues and perhaps allude to the 
interior ministry's aspirations to become a state within a 
state. While we hope that we will have that opportunity in the 
future, we cannot fail to mention with satisfaction the interior 
minister's considered, balanced, mature responses which portray 
the growth of a statesman and a politician. 
  [AZG] One would think that gunfire in Yerevan subsided 
somewhat recently. 
  [Siradeghyan] Why do you say "one would think"? Do you not 
believe your own ears? 
  [AZG] Perhaps I am being facetious. Yes, gunfire has 
subsided, but some think that the cold and the low morale have 
blunted even gangsterial emotions. Is this really fully the 
result of police work? 
  [Siradeghyan] After the president's decree was issued we 
seized from the population approximately 1,000 guns. That is 
equivalent to the arsenal of two brigades of internal security 
forces. If we extend the analogy, that means two brigades which 
are not subject to the authority of anyone. Today those people 
have been disarmed. Of course, I am not so naive as to think 
that the guns of all "free gunmen" have been seized, but most of 
them do not fire their guns any more. [passage omitted] 
  [AZG] Is the mafia concept a reality or a ghost in our 
country? I am referring only to the purely criminal aspect--say 
the gangs--and not the economic and political aspect. 
  [Siradeghyan] If we speak about purely the criminal aspect, 
then it should be called gang activity. The mafia, on the other 
hand, is multisegmented and multilayered. Obviously it also has 
its gangster elements, but it cannot exist without senior-level 
sponsors in the government, say, the prosecutor's office, the 
interior ministry and the parliament. I must concede that there 
was a time when the situation that was created in our country 
was contributing to the creation of a classical mafia structure. 
That did not happen, however, because we were able to intervene 
in time and to eliminate several large gangs which could become 
the basis for future growth. Today we have already imprisoned 40 
to 50 persons. Many people expressed the fear that if we arrest 
all the "authorities" then chaos will ensue in the criminal 
world, with blood feuds and assassinations. We were also 
prepared for such an eventuality. I must say, however, that, 
although there were a few incidents, the general pattern of 
crime did not change. Thus we achieved our objective. [passage 
omitted] 
  [AZG] Fine, but I am more interested in the "sponsors." What 
about you? 
  [Siradeghyan] That is the most difficult part of the work 
and 
is based on empirical information. I may know the "sponsor" of 
this or that gang, but to catch him in the act... Let me give a 
basic example: When we began our "purge" of the crime world, 
they began collecting signatures in the parliament in defense of 
well-known crime figures. These are five or six men whose last 
names are very well known in the capital. To this day they 
continue collecting signatures in their defense. How can we be 
surprised when there are parliamentary deputies who have been 
convicted of criminal activities in the past? Those people 
mingle in that environment, and obviously will defend it. 
[passage omitted] 
  [AZG] It is said that the police force in our country is 
depoliticized. Even so, you are considered a political figure, 
and a very powerful one. At one time they thought there was a 
battle of personalities at the top between Levon Ter Petrosyan 
and [former prime minister and defense minister] Vazgen 
Manukyan. That correlation of forces became accepted and its 
resolution was conventional. Now there is another theory that, 
after that episode, the president could expect another one. In 
other words, being the head of a consolidated, trained and 
well-armed agency like the Ministry of the Interior, you may, in 
some set of circumstances, become, let us say, the president's 
opponent or rival in political affairs. Further, it is even 
alleged that there are already differences between you and the 
president. 
  [Siradeghyan] That is truly fabulous, I have nothing to say. 
You know, it would be ludicrous to say that I am not a political 
figure. Everywhere in the civilized world the interior minister 
is a political figure. It is only natural that the head of that 
ministry be the political support and ally of the head of state. 
  [AZG] In other words, you do not have any differences with 
the president? 
  [Siradeghyan] That cannot happen. If it does happen I would 
resign from this position--or the president would tell me to 
step down and I would do so. There is no such problem. If there 
were, our domestic situation would be like that of Georgia or 
Azerbaijan, where one leader does not trust the other. 
  [AZG] I hope you will not think my questions about "rumors" 
are tactless. It is simply that since there are certain rumors 
they must be answered. For example, it is said that you exercise 
control over certain economic and financial domains. One example 
is gasoline. Another is the practice of raising and lowering the 
foreign currency exchange rate so that you can pay for the 
Korean automobiles--there was so much talk about that. 
  [Siradeghyan] What has been said is mean. Yes we were 
involved in the supply of gasoline. When there was no gasoline 
on the market we brought 20 wagons of it from Georgia. We kept 
that shipment and planned to release it on the market at the 
time the new currency would be issued. There is nothing criminal 
about that. We have a special trading structure for such 
activities and that structure was created before I took office. 
We hope that we will be able to cut the price of gasoline. 
  [AZG] By a so called "goods intervention"? 
  [Siradeghyan] Yes, but we failed to flood the market with 
goods. We sold our gasoline for a week, but the people who 
really control the gasoline business simply kept their supplies. 
  [AZG] It appears that they are not fools. How did all that 
end? 
  [Siradeghyan] We failed completely not because our opponents 
were more clever but because our allies did not act. The other 
ministries did not come to our aid. A massive flooding of the 
market with goods simultaneously with the issuance of new 
currency did not take place. Thus our enterprise vanished into 
the thin air like the gasoline. We stopped our project realizing 
that we may go bankrupt. Today we are doing it with established 
prices. We had borrowed to buy the gasoline and we still have 
not been able to repay our debt. One reason is that we gave some 
of the gasoline to emergency services and the city hall. That is 
the reality of the "gasoline legend." As for the rumors, time 
will put everything in its place. Now let me address the issue 
of the automobiles. Our original contract was for [Russian] 
Zhigulis, but then we asked our colleagues for cheaper cars. 
This led to Hyundai cars, on each of which we saved 
approximately $5,000. The clamor that was raised by some, 
including some parliamentary deputies, about that issue could 
have been put to better use. It is ridiculous to hear some 
allegations that those funds should have been spent for the 
stabilization of the new currency. Could that have been done 
with such small sums? There are methods to do that. We had 
allocated $1 million for the stabilization of the currency. 
However, when the government realized after spending half that 
sum that nothing is happening it did not spend the second half. 
Also we do not have the reserves to import hard currency on a 
continual basis. Nobody will give us such loans. It is 
impossible to maintain a stable currency exchange rate without 
backing the currency with goods and without a working economy. 
Thus, those rumors that the currency declined in value because 
we spent dollars to purchase cars is simply ridiculous.
