<F P=106> [Article by Nayiri Badalyan: "The Army Needs Reserves and </F>
Supplies"] 
  [Excerpts] Martakert [Nagorno-Karabakh]--The war continues 
in Artsakh. It continues with unrelenting intensity. The 
leadership of Azerbaijan does not wish to come to terms with the 
idea that, even after mobilizing all the resources (human and 
material) of that state for the battlefront, this offensive of 
unprecedented strength has failed like all the others before it. 
Even so, Azerbaijan continues to throw thousands of fresh 
conscripts into the meat grinder. Hoping initially to achieve 
quick success and to break through the defense forces of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] in any direction, [Azeri 
president Haydar] Aliyev tried to enhance his authority and to 
consolidate his rule in Azerbaijan. Because of that reason, it 
is not surprising that he is willing to lose large numbers of 
men and equipment for the sake of the most insignificant gain. 
Although the failure of Azerbaijan's latest offensive of 1 and 
1/2 months is evident, that country's propaganda machine has not 
stopped its boasts, drumming up the fictitious victories of the 
Azeri army. [passage omitted] This has been happening at a time 
when virtually all the major battlefields are filled with 
unburied Azeri corpses who have been left there by their 
countrymen for political reasons (so that the large number of 
casualties does not raise political complications for the Aliyev 
administration). In order to prevent the outbreak of epidemics 
special services of the NKR forces have been rounding up these 
corpses and burying them in mass graves. However, the Azeri 
authorities do not care: The killed soldier is replaced by a 
fresh one, the destroyed brigade is replaced by one from the 
reserves. A situation has been created whereby the fighters of 
the Artsakh self-defense forces, no matter how strong morally 
and convinced about the justice of their cause and their 
eventual victory, are faced with severe hardships because of a 
shortage of manpower. The boys, some of whom have been fighting 
without rest for 5 years, are tired--some even weakened as a 
result of continual sleeplessness and poor nutrition. The 
endurance of their organisms can only be explained with the 
astonishing Armenian will and ability to survive. The heroic 
defenders of the NKR have and virtually receive nothing. Their 
ammunition and weapons are primarily strategic, obtained from 
the enemy. Obviously that cannot and does not meet the 
requirements of a steadily intensifying war. Instances when NKR 
army units cannot pursue fleeing enemy formations simply because 
they are out of ammunition are not uncommon. The soldiers' lack 
of clothing and food is even more distressing. The principal 
elements of the Artsakh force are fighting in a state of 
semi-starvation. I saw with my own eyes how, in one of the 
supposedly most combat-ready (if it is possible to compare) 
units, the Stepanakert brigade, which was at one time led by the 
legendary Bekor Ashot, soldiers passed from hand to hand a few 
loafs of bread before going to battle. Breaking small pieces 
from the loaves each fighter proceeded to the post he is 
assigned. Those pieces of bread were supposed to be the food 
which would sustain them in a battle that could last all day. 
[passage omitted] 
  In these circumstances of manpower shortages the defenders 
of 
Artsakh have performed miracles. They have won victories which 
defy any military logic. Even so, the Artsakh army is in dire 
need of volunteers from Armenia and the diaspora. Today there is 
no man of arms-bearing age in Artsakh who has not been 
conscripted; all of them are on the battlefronts. The Artsakh 
army has only a small number of units, and that number is 
getting smaller each day. Artsakh no longer has any reserves. As 
Artsakh defends the cause of the Armenian nation today, the 
Armenian nation is obligated to enlist in Artsakh's cause. 
Artsakh's army is strong and combat-ready; it only needs 
enlisted men. On many occasions, the fleeing enemy is not 
pursued and the success of the Artsakh army is not fully 
developed because there are no complementary forces to take 
positions in the captured hills. Advancing soldiers often have 
to stop half way and take positions in order not to leave their 
rear unguarded. The same men attack during the day and keep 
watch at night without taking any rest. Meanwhile the routed 
enemy, having escaped hot pursuit, is able not only to rest and 
recuperate but also to receive large quantities of 
reinforcements and equipment and thus can reorganize its forces 
and resume its offensive. As long as the entire Armenian nation 
does not realize that the nation's destiny is being determined 
on the battlefronts of Artsakh and as long as throngs of 
volunteers do not head there with the call of blood, the war can 
take a dangerous turn at any moment. The people and government 
of Armenia must not allow the 150,000 Armenians of Artsakh to 
stand alone against 7 million Azeris, and must be aware that 
turning this war into a war of reserves cannot be allowed. Time 
is working in Azerbaijan's favor. The war must be concluded 
quickly. 
  It is time to wake up and begin building an army seriously. 
Also, we must not be deceived by the Azeri offers of ceasefires, 
which they remember and agree to only when they are in trouble. 
Those ceasefires are used by Azerbaijan to prepare for new 
offensives.

<F P=106> [Interview with Abulfaz Elchibey, Azerbaijan's former </F>
president, by MOSCOW NEWS observer Sanobar Shermatova: "Former 
President of Azerbaijan Does Not Rule Out a Comeback"] 
  [Text] According to some estimates, Azerbaijan has 
1.5 times as much oil as Saudi Arabia. In the final analysis 
this fact and the country's convenient location determined the 
clash of the neighboring states in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan's 
former president Abulfaz Elchibei is interviewed by MN observer 
Sanobar Shermatova. 
  When you were president, Mr. Elchibey, you tried to 
turn the country's political course away from Russia and towards 
Turkey and the West. Did you realize that the consequences of 
this course could be very serious for you? 
  To some extent yes. I did not think that I would hold on for 
a whole year and allowed myself at the most 3-4 months. At the 
same time I pinned my hopes on Russian democracy and the West. I 
wanted to believe that Azerbaijan would begin to speak with 
Russia not as a slave does with his master, but in the language 
of civilized states. 
  What was your top priority during your presidency? 
  It was to build the economic basis for Azerbaijan's 
independence and to end the war. These aims were mutually 
interconnected. There was, for instance, the agreement with a 
consortium of nine oil companies to lay a pipeline. According to 
one proposal, the oil pipeline would pass on Armenia's 
territory. This was better than running it through Iran, for it 
would be 18 kilometers shorter, and Western companies prefer to 
be partners with Armenia, not Iran. We had contacts with the 
Armenian leadership. They were agreeable, but said frankly: 
"Neither you nor we will be allowed to do this." This variant 
would have enabled Armenia to get a profit of 100 million 
dollars, which would have ended the war. But Russia had its own 
plans for Azerbaijani oil. It proposed to lay the pipeline along 
its territory and transport it through Novorossiisk port, or to 
transport it through a "Friendship" pipeline. 
  The territory of Azerbaijan has been historically an 
arena of rivalry between Russia, Turkey and Iran. Your 
pro-Turkish orientation is cited as one of the regions why you 
lost power. 
  Yes. We Azerbaijanis have a special attitude toward Turkey. 
Our kinship is based on the language, common Turkic roots and 
secular mentality. Besides that, Turkey to us is a window to the 
West, to high technologies, and to economic prosperity. Why 
should we reject all this? 
  It is interesting to note that when you were in power, 
Azerbaijan's No. 1 foreign economic partner was not Turkey but 
Iran, a country which you criticized sharply. Britain was in 
second place and Russia in third. What caused your negative 
attitude to Iran, with which Azerbaijan has a common border and 
maintains close economic relations? 
  There are 20-25 million Azerbaijanis living in Iran, who 
don't have a single national school. Not only are Azerbaijani 
national sentiments being trampled on, but their human rights as 
well. Can we tolerate the oppression of our brothers? When I 
came out against the oppression of Azerbaijanis in Iran, I did 
so not as president but as a member of the People's Front whose 
program includes solidarity with oppressed brothers. I believe 
that they will be free. 
  Was there any reaction to your statements against 
Iran? 
  Naturally there was. The Iranian intelligence service worked 
very actively in our republic. We felt this. The work was done 
in two ways: they collected intelligence data and distributed 
religious propaganda. Azerbaijanis, like Persians, belong to the 
Shi'i branch of Islam, and the promotion of the way of life 
adopted in Iran after Khomeini came to power was conducted in 
many Azerbaijani mosques. Iran's parliament allocated 100 
million dollars to conduct propaganda in Azerbaijan. We had 
information that money was distributed among young people who 
expressed a wish to study at religious educational 
establishments. It was also used to construct mosques and 
support pro-Iranian religious leaders. We knew all this, but I 
did not pay serious attention to these facts. Azerbaijanis are 
mainly secular people, which is one factor impeding 
"Iranization." Another important factor is that, as commonly 
happens, money allocated for propaganda of Iranian values simply 
ends up lining someone's pockets. The Iranians allotted money 
for the construction of three mosques in Baku and Gyandzha, but 
the mosques have not yet been built. I think that the desire for 
profits will ruin many of these initiatives. 
  Do you intend to come back to power, Mr. Elchibey? If 
you do, do you exclude having Russia and Iran as close political 
partners? 
  I believe that the Popular Front, allied with other 
democratic forces, will come to power sooner or later; it is 
only a question of time. I stand for close economic ties with 
neighbors, including Russia which, I think, will in time 
recognize our right to democracy and independence in 
foreign-policy matters. I would also like to find states in the 
West and Israel who could help balance the strong Armenian lobby.

<F P=106> [Sakinform interview with Zurab Abashidze, ambassador to the </F>
European Union and diplomatic representative to NATO: "European 
Union's Interest Focuses on Georgia"; time and date not given] 
  [Text] It has been six months since Georgia opened 
its embassy in Western Europe, in the European Union in 
Belgium. 
  Sakinform's correspondent asked Zurab Abashidze, the 
Georgian Republic's ambassador and diplomatic representative to 
NATO, to answer some questions. 
  [Sakinform] Can you summarize the activity of your 
mission--our first embassy in Western Europe--at year's end? 
  [Abashidze] Officially our activity in Brussels began last 
June. The establishment of the embassy involved many technical 
and orgaizational problems. We had to solve them quickly, 
because Eduard Shevardnadze made an official visit to Brussels 
on 21-22 June and met and talked with Belgian and NATO 
officials. You can imagine the significance of preparing for 
such a high-level visit in a time of complex political events. 
Starting our activities on such a "high note" afforded many 
opportunities. First, we saw to it that the problem of Georgia 
(in particular, Abkhazia) was the topic of systematic discussion 
in NATO. We managed to defend our position at meetings on 
various levels and have it recorded in internationally important 
documents, for example, the well-known Statement of the NATO and 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the Europarliament's 
November Resolution. Anyone who thinks these documents have no 
force is wrong. Time will tell. 
  Our embassy has regularly supplied information and materials 
on current events to the appropriate NATO bureaus, also the 
Eurocommission, Europarliament, the European Council and 
diplomatic corps. The press has published numerous reports based 
on these materials. 
  [Sakinform] Could you say that these international bodies 
now 
have a more complete and objective understanding of Georgia? 
  [Abashidze] These organizations, especially NATO, have many 
sources of information. Most important, Georgia's embassies in 
Belgium and the U.S. enable us to get more activly involved in 
day-to-day international events; this is an absolute necessity 
for any modern state. Now it is up to us how seriously we are 
represented in the international arena. If you are interested in 
our foreign colleagues' opinion, it is a pretty good start. 
  Of the former Soviet republics, for your information, 
Russia, 
Ukraine, the Baltic countries, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, and Moldova 
have opened diplomatic missions in Brussels. 
  [Sakinform] What can we expect in the future from our 
relations with NATO? 
  [Abashidze] Our interest in NATO is understandable--and the 
interest is mutual. The changes that have taken place in Central 
and Eastern Europe in recent years have prompted serious changes 
in NATO's military and political doctrine. During the Cold War 
the main thesis was to ensure the West's collective security 
against the Soviet threat; now the cornerstone is to get Eastern 
and Western Europe, and especially Russia, involved in joint 
political processes--with priority given to the West's strategic 
interests, of course. At the same time, NATO is following events 
in Russia closely and maintaining its own defense capabilities. 
NATO's boldest move toward the East is thought to be the 
creation of NACC, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. 
Besides NATO's 16 members it includes Eastern European and 
former Soviet republics. At the initial stage, NACC was set up 
as political consultative body that was designed to be more 
"educational" than practical. Still, meetings on the foreign 
ministerial level, ambassadors' and experts' conferences, and 
numerous seminars and consultations were designed to reconcile 
positions and foster cooperation in foreign policies and 
defense. It has now become clear that the West, especially NATO, 
sees much more promise in this council than it did a year ago. 
Politicians and experts think that NACC could turn into a major 
mechanism of Western-Eastern military and political integration. 
There is already some talk of giving NACC the right to perform 
certain operative functions, in particular peace-keeping 
operations. 
  I don't think we have yet fully realized the importance of 
Georgia's participation in NACC; it marks a first step toward 
bringing us closer to Western defense structures. I think the 
current year is very promising in this regard. A foreign 
ministers' meeting approved the Council's working plan for 1994, 
which, inter alia, calls for joint military exercises; this 
would be especially valuable for our army, which is in the 
formation stage. In May, our military specialists will begin to 
train in NATO training centers. There is extensive discussion 
now in the West (NATO in particular) concerning America's new 
"Partnership for Peace" initiative, which calls for raising 
NATO's relations with Central and Eastern Europe to a new level. 
What that actually means will become known after the meeting of 
officials of NATO's member states. 
  [Sakinform] Might NATO armed forces get involved in the 
Caucasus, for example to restore stability in Georgia? 
  [Abashidze] Such a move could happen only under UN auspices 
and would first require a joint decision of NATO's members. 
Remember, that "aggressive bloc" has never been involved in 
armed conflict. Even in the heart of Europe--former 
Yugoslavia--UN forces are only involved in humanitarian aid. 
NATO is especially cautious toward the former socialist 
countries, believing that a hasty rapprochement could infuse 
NATO's environment with the events and elements of conflict that 
are characteristic of the East at this stage--spreading our 
infections to NATO, so to speak. The opinion in the West is that 
NATO's intervention in the affairs of the former socialist 
countries would only strengthen anti-Western and revanchist 
sentiments in Russia, which is still suspicious of that 
organization. Consider, also, the experience of UN forces' 
actions in former Yugoslavia and Somalia, which didn't exactly 
produce positive results. So, judge for yourself. 
  [Sakinform] What practical steps were taken to broaden our 
relations with the European Union in 1990 [as printed]? 
  [Abashidze] Let me start with the practical aid the Union 
provided. In 1993 this association of Western Europe's 12 
leading countries again allocated us 40 million ecus in 
earmarked credit, which will soon be used to supply Georgia with 
wheat, margarine, sugar, and medicine (our creditors aren't 
going to hound us for this loan). We have been allocated 
humanitarian aid (a gift) of six million ecus' worth of fuel oil 
which will come to Georgia in January to relieve the energy 
crisis. The Union has allocated an additional three million ecus 
to help refugees from Abkhazia. An agreement on textile trade 
has been signed to enable us to export our goods to the European 
market without any restrictions whatever. An agreement of this 
sort is viewed here as a bigger gift than the other millions 
mentioned above. 
  A program called TAS has been completed that calls for the 
European Union to give Georgia technical assistance in 1994. It 
will involve the transfer of know-how and the drafting of 
specific programs in priority spheres such as privatization, 
agriculture, and specialist training. A high-level 
Eurocommission delegation came to Tbilisi in mid-December to 
coordinate the program. 
  Keep in mind that, however provisional it seems to us, the 
West is going through its worst economic crisis since World War 
II. Compared to the former Soviet republics, nevertheless, 
Georgia has actually benefited from the European Union's special 
concern in the past half year. 
  [Sakinform] You have talked mainly about Western aid. What 
is 
being done to turn it eventually into bilateral, mutually 
beneficial cooperation? 
  [Abashidze] Trends in cooperation are taking shape. Work is 
already underway on a vast project to create a modern 
Europe-Caucasus-Asia transportation line. We are of course very 
interested in having Georgia involved. At an international 
conference in Brussels last May the first practical step was 
taken to implement the project and protect our interests. Now 
we're trying to have the next international meeting held in 
Tbilisi. I don't want to get ahead of events, but if we achieve 
our goal, our country will have new functions and importance in 
the world. 
  Work will begin in May on a big agreement between Georgia 
and 
the European Union concerning partnership relations. This 
political and economic agreement will be of historic importance 
in terms of integrating and bringing our country closer to 
European structures. 
  Western business circles are especially interested in 
Georgia. I'm certain that after peace and political stability 
are restored, which should happen in 1994, our country will 
begin to rebuild.

<F P=106> [Article by Georgian Republic Industry Minister Vladimer </F>
Kereselidze: "A Turnaround Year. Our Industry Yesterday, Today, 
Tomorrow"] 
  [Text] The past year added many bitter pages to 
Georgia's history. This must not happen this year. Whatever it 
takes, we must restore our economy to health and turn people 
back to the economy. This is the aim of the head of state's 18 
December 1993 edict directing the various ministries, state 
committees, departments, concerns, and other structures to work 
out programs and plans to be activated in their departments and 
systems in order to solve the crisis and restore stability. 
  What is the republic's industry doing in this regard? 
It is, after all, a key sector of the nation's economy, 
accounting for a third of our national income and over half of 
the gross social product. The Industry Ministry today supervises 
mining and metallurgy, chemicals, machine-building, light 
industry, lumber and woodworking, the medical industry, and 
other multisector complexes, and takes part in formulating and 
implementing unified policies to develop them. It must play a 
crucial role in inplementing programs to solve the country's 
crisis and restore stability. That is the subject of this 
article. 
  The social-economic processes taking place in industry today 
show that the sector is firmly on its way to market relations in 
the economy. Still, the results of the activity show that the 
transition is proceeding painfully under difficult political and 
economic conditions. Output is falling, and hyperinflation is 
rampant. 
  Like the other economic sectors, industry is in a deep 
crisis. Even year before last (to say nothing of 1992 [as 
published]), production volume declined precipitously. The 
causes are many, but the main ones have been the country's 
political instability, banditry and lack of roads, the breakdown 
of money and credit relations, and the breaking of traditional 
economic ties. Due to the inefficiency of our customs service, 
stocks of hides, wool, timber, and other essential raw materials 
are being taken out of the country. The sector suffers from 
acute shortages of fuel, electricity, supplies and raw 
materials, so that a big part of our industrial potential is out 
of circulation (and resulting losses add up to tens of 
billions). In addition, privatization has been hampered while 
the state sector is not functioning well. 
  For the past three years, industry has been operating by 
inertia, without any advance plans or programs, thus creating an 
atmosphere of irresponsibility and laxity. Unsound policies have 
generated certain difficulties between production and the 
ministries and left their mark on the whole economy. 
Unfortunately, some high officials are still acting that way. 
  Over the years, enterprises under all-Union jurisdiction 
went 
unsupervised. The lack of state orders has forced them to lay 
off mass numbers of engineering-technical personnel and 
specialists. Through disuse, many installations have broken 
down, and much equipment has been sold off improperly. In 
addition, privatization has often been carried out illogically 
and harmfully. 
  We could go on listing the objective and subjective causes 
of 
industry's failures, but the Ministry cannot afford a policy of 
whining and blaming others. 
  Sad to say, the crisis has reached the pathetic stage; there 
is no room to retreat. What we need now is in-depth analysis, 
measures to correct mistakes and find our proper way--especially 
now that we have Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze's edict "On a 
Program To Overcome the Crisis and Restore Stability" to guide 
us. 
  The ministry is doing intensive, fruitful work in this 
regard. We are encouraged not only by our economic potential and 
irreversible reform processes but also by vitally important 
changes due to the restoration of traditional ties with former 
Soviet republics in all industrial sectors. We are also 
encouraged by contacts with other foreign countries. 
  The first steps have been taken in this regard. We have 
signed documents with the Russian Federation's Military Industry 
Committee and Machine-Building Committee, also an agreement with 
its Metallurgy Committee and with the appropriate departments of 
other republics. We have an intergovernmental agreement in the 
military industry sector (on technical-economic, scientific, and 
cooperative relations) which exempts organizations in this 
sphere from all quota-allocation [Russian kvotirovaniye], 
licensing, and customs fees. 
  The ministry is firmly on its way to a market economy. We 
are 
doing everything we can to create the organizational and program 
base to implement radical reforms as quickly as possible. For 
this purpose we have set up an actively functioning Reform 
Headquarters. Our task is: 
  --to achieve a certain level of balance and regulation in 
sectors of industry; 
  --to stabilize the production level of traditional products 
and to turn out world-standard, advanced products on the basis 
of structural transformations of the economy; 
  --to organize the production of strategically-important 
goods, to diminish state influence on other sectors and 
enterprises, and to privatize them in an expedient and timely 
manner; 
  --to foster the development of promising programs of 
industry 
in all approved and lawful forms and give the green light to 
market structures; 
  --to enhance the competitiveness of leading industrial 
sectors and, on this basis, put them into the orbit of world 
markets and integrative processes; 
  --to make optimal use of the country's geopolitical factor, 
adopt leading foreign and domestic technologies, effectively 
exploit local resources, and meet the demands of the domestic 
market. 
  Industry cannot develop properly unless regulating 
parameters 
are made part of production management. This refers to 
indicative planning and other market mechanisms which have 
considerable mobilizing power. Soon we will have a 
specific-action, integrated inter-departmental and 
intersectorial program and comprehensive plans to be created 
jointly with the Saknavtobi, Sakenergo, and Sakgazi departments. 
  For the first time in recent years, the ministry, 
enterprises, and organizations have jointly worked out a 
specific-action program (for 1994) designed to halt production 
decline and take comprehensive measures to stabilize production. 
It is not a plan imposed from above but a program conceived by 
the enterprises themselves to generate optimism and exert 
mobilizing power. We think the republic's industry can double 
its output over the 1993 level, which will be reflected in the 
overall end results, especially increased contributions to the 
budget. 
  This alone, however, is not enough to achieve a real 
turnaround in the economy, which cannot be done solely with 
present resources and reserves. We need to attract foreign 
investment, which requires a favorable political and economic 
atmosphere and real, concrete efforts to interest investors. 
  During the time of transition to the market, when many 
enterprises face the threat of bankruptcy, it is the ministry's 
crucial task to look realistically at their prospects in 
boosting the republic's economy. We want to set up an investment 
fund for industrial reconstruction and development--that is, a 
strategic transformation fund designed first to stabilize the 
work and then to foster accelerated development of priority 
directions. 
  We are pursuing a vigorous policy of structural 
transformations. The ministry (whose apparatus includes 16 
scientists) is working to perfect industrial sectors in 
accordance with their existing situation and prospects. I have 
in mind the enterprises' technical base and their cadres' 
ability to turn out high-quality, competitive goods, prospects 
of supplies of raw materials and manufactured components, 
anticipating sales and market conditions and meeting domestic 
market demands, and ecological, social and other factors. 
  Still, our main problem this year is to speed up 
privatization. A state privatization program is being formulated 
and implemented, which calls for the phased privatization of 
systems, enterprises and organizations in three main directions: 
converting a certain number of state enterprises into stock 
companies; buying out leased property for collective ownership; 
and selling enterprises by competition or auction. 
  The ministry is involved in the work of privatization 
commissions; it examines and approves privatization plans and 
monitors their implementation. 
  True, joint-stock company formation is proceeding slowly, 
but 
that cannot be blamed on the ministry's position. In fact, the 
ministry is encouraging effective privatization and joint-stock 
company formation efforts. We are convinced that the prime task 
is to convert inefficient state properties into efficient 
private properties. This will result, of course, in a diminution 
of the state's role in management. It does not, however, entail 
any corresponding weakening of state control. Transition to the 
new structure must be made in a way that preserves the 
production potential. This is what is most vital and important 
now. Probably, moreover, the laws and statutes on privatization 
need to be overhauled. We think, for example, that we need to 
make a timely decision on procedures for distributing funds 
generated by privatization. These funds must be used to remodel 
and develop fixed assets at the ministry's disposal which are 
not subject to privatization. Otherwise it will be too hard, 
given the unprecedented budget deficit, to assure the necessary 
investments in the economy. We think this approach is a 
realistic way to get out of the crisis. Privatization must not 
result in the loss of our accumulated industrial and scientific 
potential. 
  The state privatization program will create a new stage in 
the republic's economy. It will certainly result in shaping 
subjects adapted to the market environment, and in addition to 
boosting economic activity they will take responsibility for the 
end results. Naturally, the ministry's organizational activity 
will take on new content and should be reflected in overall 
efforts to boost the economy. 
  In addition, the ministry is paying close attention to the 
care of defense industry factories and problems of their 
conversion. We are trying to activate research institutes in the 
sector and supply the Georgian army's military equipment needs 
by means of technical cooperation with the enterprises. 
  It is gratifying to note that the UN's Industrial 
Organization has complied with our ministry's request and has 
allocated 150,000 dollars for the development of operating 
enterprises. 
  Investment brochures for every sector in the system have 
been 
developed and published in English for foreign partners, giving 
specific proposals. Relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran 
are being developed. Preliminary talks on future cooperation 
have been held with business representatives of Australia, 
Austria, Germany, Ethiopia, Turkey, Italy, and a number of other 
countries. 
  Another thing. In order to assure radical reforms in 
industrial management, the implementation of the country's 
accelerated socio-economic development, appropriate activation 
of commodity-money relations, and major strengthening of the 
role of credit and money circulation, we think it is advisable 
to create a specialized state commercial bank for industrial 
reconstruction and development. We are also counting on the 
International Machine-Building Bank that is now being formed 
(our Ministry is one of its founders). It will take care of 
clearings between countries and do much to foster economic ties 
with foreign countries. 
  Hence, the problems of industry are not the concern of the 
Ministry alone, although under the right conditions it can take 
the lead role in the national economy. Indeed, industry's 
priority in solving the country's most important tasks is 
unlimited, and we hope our ministry, through joint efforts, can 
successfuly cope with the tasks it faces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, deputy speaker of </F>
the Georgian parliament, by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent 
Yelena Imedashvili; place and date not given: "Deputies Hope for 
Accord"] 
  [Text] The Russian-Georgian agreements reached during 
President Yeltsin's visit to Georgia are causing controversy in 
both Georgia and Russia. The parliamentary majority in the 
Georgian Supreme Council has come up with an initiative to hold 
an interparliamentary dialogue with Russian State Duma deputies. 
Our OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent contacted the head of the 
Georgian delegation, the parliament's deputy speaker, Vakhtang 
Rcheulishvili. 
  [Rcheulishvili] We are aware of the irreconcilable positions 
of some deputies on both sides. But this is precisely why the 
interparliamentary dialogue is so important. After signing a 
broad agreement between our countries, it is necessary to do 
everything possible to establish partnership ties with the 
Russian Federal Assembly. Georgia has signed agreements on 
interparliamentary cooperation with many countries--Turkey, 
Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Armenia. We need to sign such a 
document with Russia. Interparliamentary cooperation assumes the 
setting up of support groups in both parliaments. The next stage 
is to establish liaison between various parliamentary 
commissions. First and foremost economic. Keeping in mind the 
close integration between our countries in the past and, to a 
certain extent, in the future. Georgia and Russia have similar 
problems. Both Georgia and Russia are multinational states; they 
have certain problems with autonomies. Both Russia and Georgia 
are states in the process of building a democratic society. This 
is a difficult road, and we have a huge common sphere of 
interests. 
  [Imedashvili] Then how do you explain the negative attitude 
on the part of a number of Duma deputies to the Russian-Georgian 
agreements? 
  [Rcheulishvili] In my opinion, one of the main reasons is 
that Russian deputies lack true information on the events in 
Georgia. Correcting mistakes should be a joint effort--of the 
parliaments, governments, and information agencies. Imperial 
forces are quite widely represented in the Russian Duma. But we 
came to Russia to talk in a calm atmosphere devoid of 
ideological or accusatory overtones. Over the past few years 
this has frequently been the mode of conversation, and has 
brought no good to either Georgia or Russia. I believe that we 
will find a common language. After all, good-neighbor relations 
and strategic cooperation are in the true national interest of 
our countries. 
  [Imedashvili] Are you not concerned about a potential 
meeting 
with Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Rcheulishvili] I am not burning with desire to meet with 
him, but this possibility cannot be precluded. Zhirinovskiy's 
fascist statements are unpleasant; however, he alone does not 
make policy in the Duma. I believe that his real role has been 
somewhat exaggerated. We will not refuse to meet with 
Zhirinovskiy and representatives of his faction. We will speak 
to all who have been elected to the Duma by the Russian people. 
  [Imedashvili] In which faction do you anticipate finding 
allies? 
  [Rcheulishvili] Of course, we have more in common with the 
democratic forces. Mostly we are interested in the 12 December 
bloc. It has not yet taken shape as a faction, but it is a very 
promising group of professionals and specialists. We expect 
support on the part of Russia's Choice and other factions. We 
count on healthy forces which understand that for Georgia, 
Russia will always be a great partner and neighbor, despite 
temporary difficulties and disagreements.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Simonov: "The Central Bank Has Raised </F>
Doubts About the Authenticity of the Ministry of Finance's Gold"] 
  [Text] The changes in the composition of the Russian 
cabinet--the Central Bank's most important victory in the latest 
round of its bout with the Ministry of Finance--must have filled 
Viktor Gerashchenko, the present chairman of the bank, with 
confidence. His latest attempts to strengthen the bank's control 
of the previous metals market provide unequivocal evidence of 
this. 
  The first step in this direction was the telegram that 
was sent to commercial banks yesterday to explain the new 
procedure for using the Ministry of Finance's "gold" 
certificates. The document, which was compiled by the Central 
Bank without the ministry's knowledge, imposes strict limits on 
possibilities for the use of the certificates. While the Russian 
banks were wondering whether they could trust the Ministry of 
Finance's gold at all, the Central Bank quickly put the 
finishing touches on its own plan for the development of the 
precious metals market. It is designed mainly to show Russian 
financiers that Central Bank personnel can handle this market as 
well as their colleagues from the Ministry of Finance. 
  At one of his press conferences in January, the chairman of 
the Central Bank reaffirmed his dissatisfaction with the 
development of the Russian precious metals market and said that 
the Ministry of Finance had been negligent, in particular, in 
organizing the campaign for the more widespread use of the 
"gold" certificates. As a result, 50 of the 100 tonnes of gold 
securing the certificates were sold to the Central Bank, and it 
used this gold to pay part of the debt assigned to commercial 
banks. After complaining about the insufficient preparations for 
the issuance of the certificates, Mr. Gerashchenko suggested 
that the Central Bank had its own plan for the establishment of 
the gold market in Russia. 
  For a long time it has been no secret that the country's 
current chief banker has had a sincere wish to reorganize the 
Russian gold reserve system. When he was still the acting 
chairman of the bank, Viktor Gerashchenko repeatedly proposed 
that the State Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones 
be removed from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance and 
that the gold reserve be administered directly by the Central 
Bank. There were several arguments in favor of this. The Central 
Bank would have gained the ability to heighten the liquidity of 
its own assets and regulate the amount of money in circulation 
quickly and efficiently by selling gold on the domestic market. 
Russian banks would have had an alternative to foreign currency 
investments, which are usually used as a hedge against 
inflation. This might have strengthened the ruble. At that time, 
however, Gerashchenko's opponents--former Minister of Finance 
Boris Fedorov and former acting Prime Minister Yegor 
Gaydar--informed the Central Bank that the Ministry of Finance 
could sell gold itself. The "gold" certificates issued last 
September corroborated this. 
  After the Russian banks had gained access to the "golden 
altar" of the finance market, they could conduct a fairly broad 
range of operations. In particular, in the event of the resale 
of the certificates, the banks could "split" their value, 
equivalent to 10 kilograms of gold (just over 203 million rubles 
at this time), and thereby attract the attention of less 
prosperous investors. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY sources, 
this was the intention of virtually all of the banks that bought 
the certificates--the Inter-Economic Savings Bank, the 
Industrial Construction Bank, "Menatep," Most-Bank, 
"Mytishchinskiy," "Russian Credit," and "Stolichnyy." 
  The liquidity of the certificates, meanwhile, left much to 
be 
desired: A decision was made to liquidate them once a year. 
Besides this, the banks could not use the purchased gold on the 
international market. The recent slight decline in the rating of 
the certificates apparently motivated the Central Bank to 
promote its own plan for the organization of the precious metals 
market (especially in view of the loyalty of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's new cabinet to the head of the Russian bank). The 
first step in this direction was the telegram defining the new 
procedure for servicing the Ministry of Finance certificates, 
which clearly diminished their appeal. 
  The telegram specifically said that, in the event of the 
resale of the certificates, the banks would be allowed to issue 
only their own bonds (instead of receipts for a specific share 
of the certificate, which had been a common 
practice--KOMMERSANT-DAILY). Central Bank staffers explained 
that all of the banks operating in the market for shares of 
certificates would have to draw up new sales documents. This 
would require the payment of the applicable tax (0.5 percent of 
the amount issued) and a registration procedure. In addition, 
the bonds could be issued only by banks which had been operating 
at a profit for the last three years, had no late payments to 
the budget or the Central Bank on their record, had complied 
with all standards, and had distributed all securities issued to 
date. This meant that many of the banks selling the certificates 
would have to collect all of the "split gold" and wait until 
September for its liquidation. 
  It is most likely, however, that the banks still have a 
chance of using the sold certificates more effectively. This is 
suggested by the absence of any mention in the telegram of the 
mechanism for the "re-recording" of certificate sales 
(KOMMERSANT-DAILY received all of this information in verbal 
reports from Central Bank staffers) and by the possible 
intervention of the issuing party--the Ministry of Finance--in 
this conflict. Finally, the Central Bank, which intends to 
publicize its own plan for the organization of the precious 
metals market soon, probably will try to reach a compromise with 
agents of the Ministry of Finance and it needs the support of 
the other banks. Obviously, this will not be that difficult, 
because the Central Bank plan appeals more to commercial banks 
than the Ministry of Finance's "Statute on Certificates," and 
the Central Bank plans to limit the group of banks authorized to 
conduct "gold" operations. In this atmosphere of fierce 
competition, the contenders are not likely to openly oppose the 
Central Bank's attempts to change the rules of play in the 
middle of the game.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zhagel, IZVESTIYA: "Central Bank Warns: </F>
Trustfulness Is Dangerous for Your Purses"] 
  [Text] The Main Administration of the Central Bank in 
the city of Moscow disseminated a special press release, in 
which it called upon the capital's population not to give in to 
the "aggressive" advertising campaign now spread in the mass 
information media, in which various firms, as bait, mention a 
very high interest or other very advantageous terms for 
investing money. 
  It is especially stressed that the attraction of deposits is 
a banking operation and, in accordance with the Russian 
Federation Law on Banks and Banking Activity, it can be carried 
out only by institutions that have received the license of the 
Central Bank and not by those that simply include in their 
constituent documents the point stating that they will engage in 
the attraction and investment of finances. 
  Specific organizations, which have received licenses for the 
performance of banking operations, are also mentioned. Taking 
the importance of this matter into consideration, we will also 
mention them. In Moscow at present, in addition to commercial 
banks, the Orgbank Interbank Association, and the Rus 
Association of Commercial Banks for Social Development, the 
following have received appropriate permits of the Central Bank: 
the Transprogress Scientific Production Association, the 
International Financial Company, the Financial and Credit 
Society, the Atis Joint-Stock Credit Company, and the Moscow 
Clearing House Limited Partnership, as well as the Central 
Clearing House, Sovfintreyd, Deviza, the Company for Project 
Financing, the Moscow Clearing Center, and the Interbank 
Financial House, which are close joint-stock companies. 
  All the other commercial structures, including GMM, Tibet, 
and others known for their advertising, do not have such a 
license and, when they engage in banking operations, they do 
this illegally. Natural and juridical persons, who have placed 
funds there, risk being deprived of their money altogether. The 
Main Administration of the Central Bank in the city of Moscow 
does not claim that all the organizations engaged in banking 
operations without a license are undisguised swindlers. Most 
likely, many simply are not familiar with existing legislation. 
However, this also characterizes their level of professionalism 
quite unequivocally, which clients should take into 
consideration. 
  Well, what punitive measures have Central Bank workers 
prepared against violators of banking legislation? 
Unfortunately, for now they are quite light and, basically, are 
reduced to the recommendation to these structures "to transfer 
their activity to official tracks, receiving the license of the 
Central Bank." The quite "merciless" measure lies in the 
transfer of the information on violators to tax services for the 
withdrawal of illegally obtained income from structures 
operating without a license. 
  I will not be mistaken if I assume that hardly anyone will 
be 
frightened by this. However, what can one do if Central Bank 
workers do not have a stable normative base under their feet to 
fight against violators? On the other hand, however, the Central 
Bank should have shown initiative and found the way to close at 
least one firm operating with the money of citizens and 
enterprises without a license--even if in order to gain the 
necessary experience here and to see the range of problems. 
  Nevertheless, to this day not a single--I repeat, not a 
single--organization, which violates banking legislation and 
endangers the financial interests of ordinary Russian citizens, 
has been closed or punished in any way.

<F P=106> [Article by M.S. Zotov, general director of the Executive </F>
Council of the Energy Association of Independent Commercial 
Banks, under the rubric "Competent View": "On Perfecting the 
System of Banks and Banking"] 
  [Text] In two and a half years the Russian banking system 
has undergone great changes, drawing considerably closer to a 
market economy. About 2,000 commercial banks with more than 
3,500 branches are already in operation (the branches of the 
Savings Bank are not included). Banking structures such as 
mortgage banks and trading houses have already appeared. 
  Banking associations are being created in the interests of 
concentrating the capital of banks to achieve investment 
objectives. Undoubtedly, the associations will play a great role 
in the stabilization of the economy, the reproductive process, 
and the development of the priority sectors of the fuel and 
energy complex, enterprises of the metallurgical complex, and 
others. Some banks have reached world standards or come 
considerably closer to them. Mosbiznesbank, Promstroybank, 
Elektrobank, Promstroybank (St. Petersburg), Kuzbassprombank, 
Kredobank, and others (a total of 30-40 banks) may be considered 
such. However, this is extremely insufficient. The process of 
perfecting banking establishments should be stepped up. 
  Despite the successes noted, we are still far from 
accomplishing all the tasks in the area of perfecting credit 
extension, monetary regulation, and settlements. Major 
miscalculations and omissions have occurred during the period of 
restructuring of the banking system and of upgrading its 
technologies. At the first stage, many banks were created under 
ministries and enterprises and were used by them as a channel to 
procure funds. Many legal and other important issues have not 
been fine-tuned. In view of this, urgent measures are needed to 
enhance the role of the Central Bank of Russia and of commercial 
banks in regulating the economy. 
  The priority of national rather than commercial objectives 
should be the fundamental platform of the Central Bank. For this 
reason the Central Bank and its organization should not directly 
engage in the extension of credit to enterprises. Otherwise they 
will acquire their own commercial objectives which may run 
counter to national ones. 
  Proceeding from this fundamental premise, the Energy 
Association of Independent Commercial Banks considers it 
necessary to revise the structure of the main directorates and 
divisions of the Central Bank. There is no need to have Central 
Bank subdivisions in each oblast and rayon. Nine to 10 main 
territorial directorates would be quite sufficient. On 9 
November 1993 the Energy Association submitted proposals to the 
Government of the Russian Federation concerning the above issue, 
as well as the issue of the establishment of an independent 
credit committee which should not report to the government or 
the Central Bank. 
  This act was caused by the need to establish order and 
discipline in compliance with financial and other legislation, 
as well as with the rules for credit, monetary, and settlement 
operations. Systematic control by the credit committee and the 
Central Bank over the operation of commercial banks will become 
the most important guarantee of liquidity in the banking system, 
smoothness of payments, and stability of the financial status of 
companies and associations. 
  It is necessary to create a council in the Central Bank of 
Russia which would develop policy in the area of monetary 
circulation, credit extension, settlements, and stabilization of 
the ruble and its convertibility. The entire range of these 
issues should be coordinated with the socioeconomic policy of 
the state. We should be guided by strategic tasks in the area of 
the economy and the tax policy developed by the government. In 
essence, at issue is the policy council defining major economic 
problems to which it is necessary to apply credit, thus 
facilitating the accomplishment of socioeconomic tasks and the 
stabilization of monetary circulation. The council would include 
four or five representatives of commercial banks, three or four 
representatives of industry and agriculture, and two or three 
representatives of the economic sciences. All of them would be 
confirmed by the government. It is feasible to include in the 
council specialists from the Ministry of Finance and the 
Ministry of the Economy in a consultative capacity. The council 
should be headed by the chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. 
The council would submit its analytical studies and proposals to 
the Board of the Central Bank and the Government of the Russian 
Federation. The decision to create the council would be adopted 
by a special edict of the president. We should not wait for the 
adoption of the Law on Banks and Banking to do this. 
  Funds allocated by the government from the budget or 
received 
in the form of credit from other states under intergovernment 
agreements for investment in special-purpose programs in 
priority sectors and other key undertakings (conversion, new 
development, major scientific discoveries, and so on) would be 
financed through the State Investment Bank which, in the 
interests of a general state investment policy, should be 
subordinated to the Ministry of Finance. It should not be 
directly involved in raising funds; however, the bank may 
finance individual facilities and programs while attracting the 
capital and resources of commercial banks. Such financing should 
be provided on a competitive basis. In this situation, the state 
would act through the Investment Bank as a catalyst, influencing 
investment and attracting private capital in the national 
interest. This will considerably enhance the role of credit in 
the reproduction of fixed assets. 
  Now about the system of commercial banks. Many of them are 
unable to fully support the interests of companies and 
associations because of insignificant joint stock and ownership 
capital. At present, credit support is mainly provided for 
brokerage operations and the generation of high rates of profits 
by banks, whereas the stabilization of the economy, its 
development, and the generation of a high rate of profit by 
economic entities should be the main goals of operation of the 
banks. 
  Perfecting the structure of commercial banks is the most 
acute issue. The creed of a bank is to be a reliable partner to 
its clients. The interpretations of goals and tasks in line with 
this would indeed facilitate the strengthening of the economy 
and the stabilization of the monetary system. This is why 
measures are necessary to perfect the system of commercial 
banks, to reinforce discipline, and to enhance their 
responsibility. For example, it would be feasible for the 
Central Bank, jointly with auditors, to audit the operations of 
some commercial banks. The operation of the banks and their 
final results cannot be separated from production, which has 
declined catastrophically. Many plants are shutting down, while 
the assets and profits of banks are growing. Some banks allow 
debit balances to occur. This is the most egregious violation of 
financial discipline which exacerbates inflationary processes. 
Licenses to engage in banking operations should be revoked on 
account of this, as well as for deviations from the principles 
of extending credit to material production, and such banks 
should be transferred to the class of subsidiary banks or 
branches. The actions of the Central Bank should be resolute in 
this instance. 
  The interests of economic stabilization, the reproductive 
process, and technical progress require that the capital of 
banks be concentrated. In conjunction with this, new banking 
structures should be formed--banking associations, banking 
finance companies, and other banking structures. Banking 
associations should be created on a joint-stock basis. Banks, 
insurance companies, financial companies, and financial 
industrial groups should be their founders. 
  Taking into account the size of the territory of Russia, it 
is feasible to create territorial commercial and local banks 
that will service regions of the country. There may be nine or 
10 such territorial banks. Their task would be to ensure the 
raising of funds and to marshal them for the development of the 
economies of their regions. It appears to us that issues such as 
price equalization and a switch to operations without subsidies 
from the budget will be resolved faster in the regions. The 
regional banks may become the nerve centers for ensuring the 
economic information necessary to evaluate the general economic 
development of the regions, as well as that of individual 
clients. This is also very important for the bank itself in 
devising a strategy and action plan for both the long term and 
shorter periods of time. 
  In view of the great significance of the task of stabilizing 
monetary circulation, reining in inflation, and reducing prices 
for consumer goods, it is necessary to sustain this area in 
every way possible with credit, and tax and interest-rate 
incentives. Banks that allocate 10-15 percent of internal 
resources to set up shops producing consumer goods should have 
the right to have this proportion of the resources exempted from 
the payment of taxes. 
  Since the Savings Bank has the most extensive chain of 
branches, it is necessary to assign to it the task of 
facilitating the development of small businesses through credit. 
This solution will make it possible to make considerable 
progress on this issue and to saturate the market with the 
necessary goods. Of course, the interests of depositors should 
be taken into account in the process. In conjunction with this, 
a norm should be set in keeping with which resources should be 
allocated for credit. 
  Credit and the interest rate policy should be used as 
instruments to implement economic development, taking into 
account the specifics of its individual stages in devising 
concrete approaches and measures to carry them out. Instruments 
should be developed which make it possible to pursue a credit 
and monetary policy by way of controlling the emission of money. 
  We should ensure that the operation of the entire banking 
system, in cooperation with the state organs of government, be 
directed toward accomplishing the strategic tasks of economic 
development of Russia. In conjunction with this, it is important 
to continuously analyze the economic situation in the country 
and factors that influence changes in it. Based on this, the 
necessary measures should be taken within the limits of one's 
jurisdiction, and issues that require government decisions 
should be referred to the government for consideration. To this 
end, the Central Bank and commercial banks should have highly 
skilled specialists-analysts on their staff. 
  For the purposes of objective assessment and substantiated 
measures to regulate monetary circulation (cash and noncash) it 
appears feasible to poll, on a quarterly basis, large and 
medium-size corporations and associations on issues of trend 
projection. To the same end, the banks should review existing 
indexes of prices for certain commodity groups for corresponding 
periods, with a considerable number of enterprises being covered. 
  The Central Bank should vigorously influence the 
restructuring of the economy of the country in keeping with the 
requirements of the market and the strategic tasks of the state 
by way of regulating credit resources and establishing 
substantiated, differentiated norms and interest rates. 
  It is important to invigorate the extension of credit that 
would promote the intensification of production and the 
development of market relations, stabilization of monetary 
circulation, and prevention of illegitimate credit expansion. It 
is necessary for the Central Bank to establish a firm limit on 
the increment of credit. Limitations should be based on 
realistic calculations which take into account increments in the 
volume of production, sales, and the number of economic entities 
served. The role of credit in investment should be enhanced 
sharply; the proportion of credit should be brought to 20-30 
percent of the total amount of capital investment (at present, 
it stands at 3.5 percent). It is feasible for commercial banks 
to allocate up to 30 percent of resources to the long-term 
credit fund (FDK), and to use these resources first of all for 
the retooling and upgrading of the production sphere. In cases 
in which economic entities do not have sufficient internal funds 
for capital investment, they should be granted the right to 
effect accumulation in the FDK account. Once 70 percent of the 
amount necessary to make capital investment in the envisioned 
facility is attained, the bank should open credit for the 
remainder of the amount. In this instance, the bank would set 
the interest rate 30 percent below the average market rate. If 
accumulation in the FDK account was effected over two or three 
years, the interest rate may be lowered by 40-50 percent. 
  Limitations on credit for banks (and their branches) should 
be introduced in the interests of reinforcing monetary 
circulation and stabilizing the economy. At issue are limits on 
special-purpose allocations to carry out the programs of 
priority enterprises; limits on regular credit to be extended to 
medium-size enterprises and for uses with the short recovery of 
funds; limits of consumer credit (including that for the 
development of small businesses and housing construction); and 
regular limits for brokerage and other purposes. 
  Along with the setting of norms for the excess of credit 
indebtedness over the capital of the bank (20-fold at present), 
certain norms for the issuance of large loans should be 
established (for example, five to seven large loans should not 
be greater than three to four times the excess, and all large 
loans--greater than six to eight times the size of ownership 
capital). The practice of the last three years indicates that 
95-97 percent of credit resources are issued for periods of one 
to three months for brokerage and current uses by enterprises, 
which causes economic and financial complications in the 
operation of enterprises and associations. The introduction of 
limits is a temporary measure devised for a period of 
transition. However, it will provide an opportunity to orient 
the bank toward production which is absolutely necessary in the 
existing economic situation. 
  As a rule, credit resources would be provided to commercial 
banks against the pledge of enterprise securities. This would be 
one of the measures of real backing which is necessary to 
stabilize monetary circulation. 
  It appears to us that the Central Bank of Russia should have 
a clear-cut program for stabilizing monetary circulation and 
reinforcing the convertibility of the ruble. This program should 
call for a phased approach to the attainment of the goals set, 
as well as measures that commercial banks should take. It is 
necessary to envision in the program the gradual abandonment of 
centralized resources. All budget support should be provided 
directly through the financial organs. 
  Of course, the above does not exhaust the entire multitude 
of 
issues of perfecting the banking industry. However, we are 
convinced that it is necessary to solve the problems that have 
been touched upon in this article. We believe that we will meet 
with understanding from the broad banking community, and that 
bankers will contribute considerably to accomplishing the task 
of stabilizing the economy, which is vital for our country.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Delyagin, Institute of Economic Problems </F>
of the Transition Period: "Conversion of Currency Credits Helps 
Regenerate Russia's Economy"] 
  [Text] The gradual, but steady stabilization of the ruble, 
as far back as the middle of last year, compelled us to seek 
more refined mechanisms for currency operations. 
  The most promising, and at the same time most complicated of 
them has now been singled out: conversion of foreign currency 
credits into domestic ruble credits. The difference between the 
interest rates on world markets (from 3.5 to 17 percent) and in 
Russia (the Central Bank discount rate, let us remember, is 210 
percent), given the slow rise in the dollar exchange rate, is 
fully capable of compensating for even the high risk of 
investments in Russia. 
  The financial sphere is very conservative. In order to take 
low-interest credits on Western markets, one must have great 
prestige and reliable guarantees. The instability in Russia 
makes it so difficult to obtain them that today it makes the 
mechanism described inaccessible even for the most serious 
structures. 
  The most widespread method of surmounting the difficulties 
involves using Russian capital located overseas. For example, 
the capital legally circulating there can be used as a guarantee 
of the redeemability of Western currency credits, subsequently 
being converted to ruble credits in Russia. 
  A promising route is to sell sizable blocks of shares of 
major Russian structures, allowing potential creditors or 
guarantors to control them, in order to win the necessary 
confidence. 
  The largest Russian banks today are studying mechanisms to 
provide other Western guarantees and to draw in low-interest 
currency credits. At the same time, one should emphasize the 
exceptional profitability, and this means also the exceptional 
scale, of the forthcoming operations, which does not simply lead 
to enriching individual commercial structures, but has a major 
influence on the entire development of Russian society. 
  The spare capital of the world economy many times exceeds 
the 
entire monetary mass circulating on the territory of our country. 
  As a result of the strong conservatism of the financial 
market, this change in investment volumes will be quite smooth, 
and society will most likely succeed in adapting to its 
individual manifestations. The scale and depth of the influence 
to which Russia is to be subjected in the next few years, 
however, makes it necessary to foresee at least its basic 
consequences, which should not take us unawares -- as, for 
example, when the catastrophic exacerbation of the deficit 
(depressed inflation), connected with the mass pumping of 
non-cash monies into the wage fund, took us unawares in 1988 and 
1990. 
  The influx of currency funds is capable of replacing the 
administrative mechanism of the infusion of centralized funds 
with the market mechanism and therefore, with the much more 
effective mechanism of an infusion of commercial credit. Under 
these conditions, the variant, approved in world practice, of a 
unified emission mechanism, in which the increase in the 
national monetary mass would be limited by the influx of foreign 
currency, would be fully applicable. It is this mechanism which 
improved the war-destroyed financial systems of Europe and 
Argentina (the latter was poised on the brink of 
hyper-inflation, periodically breaking down into it, over a 
period of six decades). 
  In this way, we would by-pass major acceleration of a rise 
in 
prices. The possible surpluses of the monetary mass would be 
small and would be compensated for with the aid of the "fine 
tuning" of the Central Bank (an efficient change of the discount 
rate and norms for reserves, differentiation of the latter by 
types of assets) and with the aid of the natural expansion of 
the markets (through the share market and the real estate 
market). 
  The effect of the "currency vacuum cleaners" may become the 
most important instrument for surmounting the economic crisis 
and the main path to regenerating Russia as a supreme power. 
They should therefore be supported to the utmost by the state, 
right up to creating the corresponding insurance funds for the 
capital coming into Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Alekseyev, corresponding member of the </F>
Russian Academy of Sciences, chairman of the Research Council of 
the Center for Private Rights under the president of the Russian 
Federation: "Under the Spell of the New Utopia: About Old Errors 
and New Ways To Develop Privatization"] 
  [Text] Utopias are tempting, insidious, and diverse 
in their characteristics; but attempts at their practical 
implementation are one and the same always and everywhere--the 
imposition of impracticable schemes on people, coercion, and the 
inevitable shattering of illusions. 
  That is what happened with the Marxist utopia of 
communism. 
  That, alas, is what in many ways is also happening with 
one of our new utopias--the privatization program that is being 
implemented now. 
<H5>  Privatization Socialist Style </H5>
  It is difficult to understand the reasons that conditioned 
the rather broadly and persistently propagandized opinion that 
the privatization being conducted in Russia at the present time 
is radical and "of the people"--the kind that will create an 
extensive class of private property owners and that will include 
almost all Russian citizens in this middle class. For if we 
divert our attention from the forceful and bombastic declaratory 
statements of the supporters of such a program (set, by the way, 
by the RSFSR Supreme Soviet according to its own principles), 
then it is not difficult to see that in a number of its 
features--fortunately, not in all of them--it is utopian, and in 
addition to this it has a leveling, orthodox-socialistic 
character. 
  First, the program is being conducted in such a way that the 
main part of the national wealth remains under state domination. 
The volume of properties being received by vouchers is trifling 
(for each, the "note" has a value on the order of about 
one-fourth of an average monthly wage, or $15). All of the 
natural resources, "public" enterprises, and controlling blocks 
of shares of stock of a majority of the enterprises converted to 
joint-stock companies remain with the government. 
  Second, the distribution itself of state property by 
vouchers 
takes place according to the socialist principle--the division 
of property among all fellow citizens "as equals." And if such a 
division under conditions of deeply rooted private property 
attitudes (as, for example, in the Czech and Slovak republics) 
is capable of reinforcing these attitudes and expanding their 
subject makeup, then, under conditions of the domination of 
state property and the until now the indestructible 
parasitical-consumer psychology of a majority of the population, 
a similar result is possible, but then this is not always, only 
during the use of vouchers for the acquisition of property by 
the "labor collective"--however, with all of the contradictions 
inherent in the given method of privatization. 
  Third, that which in Russia is now called "privatization" is 
built on an understanding of property that corresponds to 
socialist concepts that equate property with wealth, benefits, 
and the source of a mellow and carefree life (the idea of its 
division "as equals" comes from this). 
  Meanwhile, property in the economy is not so much a consumer 
blessing as much as a burden and responsibility--a material 
basis for the application of intensive labor, enterprise, risk, 
brains, and talent. Its main criterion and indicator are "one's 
own" investments and the investment of profits in production. It 
is this effect that private property gives under conditions of 
competition and market rivalry. And, consequently, the general 
task of real privatization does not consist in dividing objects 
of property "as equals," but making property really private and, 
consequently, an incentive for intensive labor, an increase in 
labor productivity, a factor of responsibility for work, and a 
force that motivates "personal" investments. 
<H5>  The Insidious Voucher </H5>
  It is necessary, of course, to see that the privatization 
being conducted currently has positive aspects (as, by the way, 
some facets of socialist concepts are not without sense). It 
"turned" Russian citizens toward questions of property, and the 
rudiments of business appeared. 
  The fundamental deficiency of the ongoing privatization 
program is that it is aimed at the implementation of utopian 
ideas--to make all citizens of Russia private property subjects 
with the help of privatization voucher-checks. 
  Well, vouchers have a known moral significance: They are 
evidence that the state is a debtor to its own citizens; in some 
measure, vouchers can have the character of temporary material 
assistance to citizens. 
  But it is impossible in principle to transform all of our 
fellow citizens into private property owners--bearers of small 
parts of the wealth of former state property--with the help of 
vouchers. Not only because of the scantiness of the "portion" 
received and the modest prospects of acquiring incomes on the 
shares of stock acquired for vouchers. And not only because 
state property and a parasitical consumer psychology continue to 
reign in society. But principally because this is contradicted 
by the very nature of a dynamic commodity market economy, on the 
creation of which economic reforms are calculated, inasmuch as 
property-owning citizens who do not participate in production 
can only be property-owning rentiers who parasitize on 
production and on the results of the activity of property-owning 
producers (that is why in countries with a developed economy, 
pensioners, servicemen, and workers in the budgetary 
institutions are supported by the state and are not directly 
supported by property-owning producers). 
  It seems that already now a number of aspects of a 
privatization that is built on a system of vouchers has 
engendered a lot of negative consequences. 
  First, many important elements of privatization relating to 
production and having independent significance were "driven" by 
concerns for the success of the voucher system, and so that 
shares of stock of any enterprises being privatized could be 
acquired by all voucher owners. 
  Second, the voucher system, contrary to the purpose of 
property in production, is even a disincentive to work. In a 
situation of all-out propaganda ("gold vouchers," "thousand 
percent incomes," etcetera, etcetera), the impression is created 
that it is possible to receive impressive incomes at the expense 
of "the work of others" through shares of stock acquired for 
vouchers. 
  Third, also with respect to enterprises whose shares of 
stock 
were acquired for vouchers--this is a disincentive, inasmuch as 
such a procedure involves an increase in the number of people 
who do not work in production, but who claim a share of the 
profits, in a word, still another tax on profits that is not 
justified by anything. 
  Well, and the very idea of a "return" with the help of 
vouchers to pensioners, doctors, teachers, servicemen, and state 
budget employees of state property (attractive and tempting, 
just like all socialist ideas) is futile and without promise. 
<H5>  They Got What They Were Fighting Against </H5>
  In behalf of the success of the voucher system, the ongoing 
privatization program essentially limited the rights of the 
labor collectives. This, in addition to everything else, 
alienated a substantial number of labor collectives from 
democratic movements with which the privatization program is 
associated. 
  At the same time, there are a lot of reasons for the guarded 
and even negative attitude toward the privatization being 
implemented by labor collectives. After all, the "labor 
collectives" that were formed under conditions of the 
socialistic command-planning system were in themselves not 
adapted to economic management as property owners, and they 
frequently were only a cover and a conduit for commands issued 
by the party-administrative elite. Therefore, in the opinion of 
the author of these lines, the "lease-purchase" variant of 
privatization that operated in the past, which was optimal for 
post-totalitarian conditions, did not have the labor collective 
as the strong point as such, but the "organization of 
leaseholders," which at first mastered the difficult school of 
"its own" economic management step by step, and only afterwards 
became a fully-fledged property owner. 
  The system of privatization in operation, which is geared to 
voucher distribution, nevertheless could not bypass the labor 
collectives, and a substantial number of the latter, having 
overcome by hook or crook the obstacles and impediments created 
for them, became "closed" joint-stock companies--property owners 
of privatized property. But they became "as such" without 
changing, and without adapting to difficult economic management 
as private property owners. 
  Well, it happens. As one of the unexpected consequences of 
"people's" privatization, Russian society received precisely 
that against which it was fighting, and also in a worse variant. 
In a number of oblasts and sectors of the national economy, and 
in a number of localities, enclaves of the command-planning 
system were firmly established under the flag of labor 
collectives and the aegis of the old regime director corps. And 
now there is no need to be surprised that a base of the past 
party-administrative aktiv has been consolidated and that the 
source of the increasing strength of communist and procommunist 
circles has been broadened. 
<H5>  But What Is To Be Done? </H5>
  First of all, it is necessary to see the truth, the real 
state of affairs. Unfortunately, until very recently the 
reaction of the adherents of the current programs of "people's" 
privatization to critical considerations and proposals was not 
of a practical nature, and it sometimes ended up in irritated, 
peremptory cries and the application of labels to the authors of 
these kinds of considerations and proposals. Is it really 
necessary to wait for a complete crash that will also cancel the 
movement forward on the most complicated problems of 
reorganizing property in order to agree on obvious facts, to 
discuss debatable ideas, and to begin to make corrections in the 
ongoing privatization process? 
  Then, it is clear, it is necessary to explain oneself to the 
people immediately. It must be believed that the authors of the 
programs in effect sincerely wanted to make all Russians 
property owners of those riches that they earned a long time 
ago, and to create equal conditions for everyone to enter the 
market. But then, not everything that is planned works out. The 
people will understand, if they are talked to sincerely and 
honestly. And judging by everything, it is still not too late to 
develop a system of compensatory measures. 
  The main thing is this, after preserving everything that is 
positive that has already been achieved in the process of 
privatization, to persistently spread the privatization 
processes directly to production. In order that private property 
would begin to work not only in the sphere of marketplace 
resales and clever currency operations, but so that it would 
become a powerful incentive to work. 
  Three measures are presented here as priorities. 
  First-- resolute legislative and governmental 
support in the production of private business and all forms of 
private property (not "forms of private property" in general, 
but specifically private ownership), i.e., private 
entrepreneurs, intact production cooperatives, and 
private-collective enterprises--all of those that on the basis 
of "their own" property, market competition, risk, and 
responsibility work in the market to saturate it with quality 
goods and services. It is precisely with respect to such private 
commodity producers (but not "commodity producers" in general) 
that it is necessary finally to decide substantially to reduce 
taxes, to remove all restrictions that encroach on economic 
freedom, to support them with credits, to establish for them, as 
for all other "commodity producers" (bureaucratic subsidized 
state enterprises also hide behind this cunning formula) single, 
stable "rules of the game"--civil legislation worked out in 
detail. 
  Second-- inclusion of the workers themselves in 
the practical relations of the private property of enterprises 
converted to joint-stock companies. Here, without in any way 
wrecking the system of already established joint-stock 
enterprises and their current forms, it would be quite justified 
to strengthen and enrich this system, conditionally speaking, 
with "producer societies" established for worker-joint-stock 
enterprises that would have, for example, "doubled shares of 
stock" [sdvoyennyye aktsii]: in order, however, that the 
normatively established part of the incomes for these shares 
goes to investment in production. It can be confidently 
predicted that the effect of such an inclusion of the workers 
themselves of converted joint-stock companies with respect to 
private property in the sphere of production will be significant. 
  Third--the kind of reorganization of open 
joint-stock companies (after a resolution of all questions 
associated with voucher privatization) when their "openness" 
would be oriented not on the possessors of papers, behind which 
there is no real wealth, but on actual domestic and foreign 
investors--the possessors of capital. Such a "directed openness" 
would make it possible, as experience indicates, to implement a 
structural, technical, and technological restructuring of 
production and ensure a considerable increase in the 
productivity of labor, market vitality, and the activeness of 
enterprises. 
  These and other corrections in the ongoing privatization 
program will give it, as can be expected, a real and effective 
nature and will make it possible to put into effect the 
potential of private property as a powerful work incentive and a 
high degree of responsibility for work, which are factors in the 
growing investments in production. It is necessary just to free 
oneself of "voucher illusions" and the current utopian hopes 
that are associated with them.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Makovskaya, under the rubric the "Money </F>
Market": "New System for Registration of Stock Issues: Bankers 
Must Report to Future Investors"] 
  [Text] The Central Bank of Russia [TsBR] has published a 
new edition of the instructions on the system for issuing and 
registering securities of commercial banks. When this issue was 
prepared, the text was not yet in official distribution, but in 
the opinion of specialists, the amendments and additions made in 
the document should fill in the gaps left by the instructions 
which preceeded them (No 8), which have been in effect for the 
last year and a half, as well as bolster the TsBR's control over 
the issue of commercial bank stock. 
  Beginning on 15 February, all Russian commercial banks must 
compile prospectuses for the issue of securities following a 
form which envisions inclusion of information on major 
stockholders who own more than 5 percent of the votes (as well 
as, in turn, the major stockholders of those stockholders). 
Furthermore, in the prospectus for the issue, bankers will have 
to indicate information on members of the council of directors, 
the size of their blocks of stock, and their participation in 
other organizations, indicating the posts (to avoid 
cross-holding of blocks of stock). The document must give the 
investor an idea of the procedure for forming the bank's capital 
stock and the managers of the structure in which he has decided 
to invest money. Until now such information has been offered 
only to the antimonopoly committee, which usually approves the 
prospectus of the banks' issue after the TsBR does. 
  Moreover, now the Central Bank of Russia has made commercial 
banks provide any investor with an issue report containing, 
along with the traditional information, the information listed 
above upon the first demand. If the bank employees "do not have 
a prospectus available," the client has the right to present a 
complaint of improper treatment to the TsBR. If the violations 
do not prove to be isolated occurrences, the TsBR may suspend 
the commercial bank's subscription campaign. 
  As the chief of the securities division of the TsBR, Andrey 
Kozlov, announced at a press conference devoted to putting the 
system for issuing and registering stock of commercial banks 
into effect, its creators tried to protect the investor's 
interests at least in the banking sector by providing him with 
maximum access to all the information needed to make the right 
decision in selecting an investment object. Andrey Kozlov noted 
that in the West all the moral and financial responsibility is 
on the investor himself when a particular financial structure 
goes bankrupt, since the investor always has the opportunity to 
obtain exhaustive information about the enterprise or the bank 
whose stock he is buying. But in Russia some of the moral 
responsibility to the ordinary citizen, who is being tempted by 
one ad for huge dividends after another, lies on state organs. 
Thus, the TsBR has decided to make a contribution to protecting 
the investor by suggesting that he demand from the banks a 
detailed issue prospectus certified by the bank manager, his 
chief accountant, and the auditing firm. 
  The new instructions, in addition to provisions which 
toughen 
control, contain a nice surprise even for bankers. Until 
recently, during the subscription campaign, capital obtained 
while the bank stock was being placed was accumulated in a 
special frozen account in the TsBR. Since 15 February, this rule 
does not effect the issue of bonds, since they are the direct 
financial obligation of the bank. The instructions also took 
into account the desires of bankers who complained that the 
system for capitalizing the profits of the bank stockholders 
which were not distributed as dividends was unclear. The 
document contains a social section devoted to formal accounting 
for the refinancing of some of the bank's profits. 
  The document contains certain restrictions related to the 
procedure for forming the bank's capital stock during the first 
placement of stock. A bank's founders used to be allowed to make 
their payments in motor vehicles, equipment, and other material 
assets. From now on, during the first issue of a bank's stock, 
contributions to the capital stock are permitted only in rubles, 
hard currency, or premises belonging to the founders with the 
right of ownership. 
  In explaining the Bank of Russia's position regarding those 
commercial banks which before 15 February submitted issue 
prospectuses in the old form to the TsBR, Andrey Kozlov noted 
that "draconian measures will not follow," but each case will be 
examined separately. If the issue prospectus was already 
examined by the securities division of the TsBR and then got 
"bogged down," let us say, in the antimonopoly committee, the 
TsBR will make an inquiry of the committee and most likely 
declare the bank's prospectus compiled according to the old 
norms valid. 
  In the next issue of KOMMERSANT, we will begin 
publication of the new document, which is important both to the 
issuing bodies and to investors.

Sciences provoked a stormy debate on the pages of the press and 
passed through several stages of fairly serious discussion. 
  The leaders of some of the factions of the State Duma (the 
Agrarian, Democratic, and Communist parties and the New Regional 
Policy) were the organizers of the first review of it. Then this 
document, along with the alternative programs of S. Glazyev and 
Ye. Saburov and the report of the Ministry of Economics, were 
the subjects of a constructive discussion at an expanded meeting 
of the collegium of the Ministry of Economics. And the very next 
day, 10 February, parliamentary hearings were held; they drew to 
the State Duma a significant number of deputies who responded in 
an animated and involved way to this particularly important 
topic. The meeting at the "Reforma" Foundation with ambassadors 
and representatives of all the CIS countries and the Baltics was 
not covered in the mass information media, although, in the 
opinion of its participants, it was a very interesting and, most 
importantly, useful one. 
  The meeting of the "Vzaimodeystviye" (Cooperation) Club 
under 
the chairmanship of Ye. Gaydar was clearly out of tune with all 
these discussions. But it is undoubtedly of interest, since the 
position of the members of the Gaydar team (P. Aven, A. 
Nechayev, and A. Illarionov) and its sponsors from business 
circles (M. Yuryev and K. Bendukidze), as well as the active 
propagandists of "shock therapy" (O. Latsis and M. Leontyev), 
was most explicit. 
  It is certainly clear that each person has his own 
interpretation of the processes occurring in Russia. There is 
nothing surprising in the fact that the attitudes of the 
"retired" members of the government and the current ones, the 
nouveau riche from speculation and the contingent of directors, 
and the independent and employed journalists toward the methods 
of the reform and toward its results and consequences are varied. 
  In the opinion of Ye. Gaydar and his comrades, even age is 
significant, and that has suddenly become one of the main 
arguments for not accepting the Academy report. The fact that 
young associates of a number of leading economic institutes also 
participated in preparing the report did not have an effect, of 
course; since battling with academicians who have become wiser 
and are well known is more honorable, and most importantly, the 
external effect is something altogether different. And then 
academicians are Soviet, so an anti-imperialist fuse can be 
displayed. 
  But which of the crucial problems of the report irritate and 
even openly anger the purveyors of "shock therapy" the most? 
  The first is their fundamental disagreement with the 
evaluation of the results of the 2-year period of reform and the 
conclusion that the policy they followed failed. According to 
the allegation of Ye. Gaydar and A. Illarionov, a period of 
stabilization began and a gradual rise in the standard of living 
of Russia's citizens was underway. 
  Like most of Russia's population, we naturally cannot agree 
with that. The report has figures which suggest just the 
opposite. Social indicators signal an alarming situation in the 
fields of demography, public health, the structure of 
consumption, monetary income, stratification of society, the 
strike movement, unemployment, and the like. Mr. Illarionov says 
that we must look at the statistical reports in a different, 
more "professional" way. That, incidentally, is from the same 
opera where the minister of internal affairs, V. Yerin, suddenly 
says that the crime rate has dropped to almost one-tenth its 
previous level, while before our eyes gangs with automatic 
rifles organize fights every day and ordinary citizens have 
completely forgotten evening walks. Obviously, in the evenings 
they should study the statistics in a "professional" way behind 
armored doors. It is important to note that the results of the 
analysis of the 2 years of "shock therapy" and the conclusions 
from it by the authors of all three alternative drafts that this 
policy was a complete failure virtually coincide. So accusing 
the academicians of a certain bias and a desire to slander the 
activity of Gaydar and Company is simply inaccurate. 
  The second problem. The authors of the report proposed the 
mechanism of fixing prices for a restricted list of output for a 
certain amount of time as one of the elements of stabilization. 
It is clearly stated that this means energy media, weapons, and 
transport rates. What is more, Gaydar immediately accuses the 
"old" academicians of yearning for the past and wanting to set 
prices for all output produced. 
  But, in the first place, the academicians' proposal is not a 
repeat of the past, since even now the government and the local 
executive authorities set prices correspondingly on, for 
example, gas, electricity, weapons, freight hauling rates, 
domestic services, and municipal passenger transport. 
Incidentally, prices for oil are also regulated by special 
governmental decision, not in absolute amounts but through a 
limit on profitability. 
  In the second place, throughout the world the state actively 
participates in regulating prices for the output of monopolies 
and for certain strategic types of goods. Even now Japan 
regulates prices for... rice. So the allegations of P. Aven and 
A. Nechayev that prices can be regulated only under a Stalinist 
regime seemed strange. Academician Shatalin should really be 
ashamed of his former pupils here. 
  In the third place, the proposed model is considered a 
temporary measure to eliminate the enormous disproportions which 
have taken shape in the levels and ratios of prices. How long 
can we repeat the necessity of preserving price parity for 
agricultural output and goods delivered to run agriculture and 
not make even one attempt to achieve it? 
  The report contains a by-stage plan for leveling prices 
which 
cannot, however, be realized exclusively through market 
mechanisms. 
  Problem No 3. There is abundant criticism of the proposal to 
introduce another exchange rate for the ruble during the 
transitional period in addition to the market rate, a rate 
determined by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and 
used as the official one. Such a rate, in our opinion, should be 
established based on the real export-import price proportions 
and taking into account the rates of the "baskets" of foreign 
currencies and the dynamics of domestic prices and rates. 
  You must agree that 1,500 per dollar is not reality; it is a 
speculative, distorted rate, a "Snickers" [candy bar] rate. But 
it is precisely what is used to convert the currency earnings of 
enterprises in order to then confiscate it in the form of taxes, 
customs duties, and charges. Only speculators hold to this rate, 
which enables them to buy our industrial giants for 100,000 
greenbacks. All the country's national wealth, if it is 
converted into dollars, puts Russia among the most 
underdeveloped countries. Isn't that absurd? 
  The fact that a ruble rate which is much much too low 
encourages dumping exports causes prices for imports to rise 
unacceptably, and everyone, even people who are not scientists, 
understands that it has become a cause of inflation and higher 
prices. An ordinary person feels this in his bones, if you will. 
But the former team of the powers-that-be discourse seriously on 
why all the entrepreneurs are hiding money abroad and why no one 
is investing hard currency in developing our own production. 
  There can be a healthy currency only in a healthy economy! 
As 
long as the economy is sick, it must be treated! If you do not 
like our medicine, suggest a different one, but the patient must 
be treated rather than watching him die. 
  The fourth problem. Privatization. As is well known, the 
very 
first critic of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] and 
"Reforma" Foundation report was the legendary and inflexible A 
Chubays. Without reading them, he swept aside all the proposals, 
categorically announcing (for some reason on behalf of the 
entire government) that there was no reason to examine this type 
of document. And for greater persuasiveness he took the 
president as his ally, although B. Yeltsin has not yet reacted 
to the report even now. 
  The directive, all-out nature of the supersonic 
privatization 
being conducted under the principle "treat everyone the same" 
cannot accomplish any end except mercenary ones. And they are 
being accomplished right in front of a population fooled by the 
universal distribution of vouchers. 
  Our position is that privatization should be considered an 
instrument of structural perestroyka and investment policy. The 
fiscal tasks are accomplished in passing, of course, that is to 
say, the state treasury must not be diminished. 
  The slogan, let us create millions of owners, has no 
economic 
or social sense. First, we all have our own property now, thank 
goodness. Secondly, by no means does everyone want to get a part 
of state property and then manage it and be responsible for this 
piece like private property, and there are even fewer who know 
how to do this. It is appropriate to cite an example from the 
experience of some of the European countries. There anyone can 
buy land, but only those who have a qualified permit have the 
right to use it to run a farm. Thirdly, scattering property and 
the functions of managing it among millions of small owners, as 
world experience shows, leads to the erosion rather than 
augmentation of fixed capital. 
  That is why that from the beginning we were absolutely 
against duping the population with vouchers. They are still 
being touted. On television now there is such an ad every half 
hour: sometimes First Voucher, sometimes MMM-Invest, and 
sometimes someone else with these fantasies. But it was evident 
at the past meetings of the check funds that there is nothing to 
use to pay people dividends. They even wanted to borrow bank 
credits (the newspaper KOMMERSANT called this madness). 
  Our report suggests that the focus must be changed from 
privatization of property to privatization of management. We 
must truly rid the state of the command of those sectors which 
must "hustle" in market conditions. The process of destatization 
must force enterprises to adapt themselves to the market. But 
the state sector must also be preserved in certain spheres. And 
it must be managed and aided. 
  But of course these approaches do not please Mr. Chubays and 
other members of Ye. Gaydar's team. And besides, we dared to 
announce that all privatization work must definitely not be 
entrusted to one department. In the newspaper IZVESTIYA (10 
February 1994), Ye. Gaydar writes that he is "by no means making 
any personal insinuations and, moreover, is confident of the 
personal honor of many people, especially among the higher 
managers." But I personally am not so confident. Yegor 
Timurovich says that "bolstering the state's role is for the 
sake of the possibility of quick enrichment at state expense." 
But I personally think that the state withdrawing from a 
multitude of functions has already enriched many people, 
including certain higher managers. 
  And the last thing, the state's role. We devoted an entire 
section to the problem of bolstering state regulation. This 
theme runs through the entire report. I will not repeat the 
essence of the proposals, but for readers and for zealous 
monetarists I will cite one quote. Don't believe the Russian 
academicians, it is your business. But here is what their 
foreign colleagues from the leading institutes of the world 
(Germany, the United States, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, 
and Poland) which joined into a special working group to study 
the problems of the socioeconomic reconstruction of Central and 
Eastern Europe write: 
  "The historical experience of the `economic miracle' of the 
postwar restoration of Western Europe convincingly contradicts 
the opinion that Europe will reach the heights of capitalism 
quickly and without planning. Thus, during the period of 
reconstruction: 
  "1) the exchange rate of currencies was under control and 
the 
movement of capital was strictly regulated, while the free 
convertibility of currency for business transactions was 
introduced over a period of more than 10 years; 
  "2) control over prices for the key commodities and 
subsidies 
to maintain them were preserved for that same long period of 
time, while in some sectors (agriculture and power engineering, 
for example), they are in effect even now; 
  "3) privatization of state property never had a high 
priority. For decades many large companies (Volkswagen, for 
example) did not enjoy the privileges of private property, 
without apparent damage to the results of their activity; 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  "7) it was understood that monetary reform as well as 
stabilization measures should promote the reconstruction and 
expansion of production potential; in no case was achieving 
abstract monetarist goals allowed to lead to the ruin of the 
production apparatus; 
  "8) a vigorously operating state able to manage the market 
and maintain it by creating the appropriate institutions and 
legal structures as well as tax and financial programs was a 
crucial factor for normalizing the economic situation in order 
to step up entrepreneurial activity. 
  "An important historical lesson can also be derived from the 
successful modernization and growth of the Japanese economy, and 
subsequently from the development of the `little tigers': Hong 
Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea. Their success is based 
on the nondogmatic recognition of the fact that the market must 
be managed..." 
  Those are the interesting conclusions which independent 
scientists of foreign countries make in the book entitled "The 
Market Shock" [ISBN 0-472-08204-3, pp 131-133). Doesn't that 
convince you? 
  There is the popular term "self-involved" ["zatsiklennost"] 
which is applied to a certain category of people. They are very 
pig-headed; they see everything in their own terms. I am 
absolutely convinced that the entire Gaydar team is wrapped up 
in itself and all dialogues with it are now absolutely useless. 
But, thank goodness, there are sensible people and progressive 
forces. We must rely on them now, during this period so 
difficult for our country.

Required"] 
  [Text] The steps recently taken by the government to 
improve the economic situation and strengthen the social 
orientation of the reforms inspire hope that they will finally 
begin to work. However, one must take into consideration the 
fact that the actual state of affairs in the national economy is 
an extremely complicated one -- if not to say, becoming worse. 
During the last two years or more, the reforms have raised more 
questions than they have provided answers and positive solutions. 
  As before, the main question is: When will a change for the 
better finally arrive -- what must be done to overcome the 
drawn-out crisis? Its solution is directly connected with 
eliminating the disproportions that have recently intensified in 
the national economy, lowering inflation rates and strengthening 
the reforms' social orientation. 
  Estimates of the future show that if appropriate adjustments 
are not made in the reforms, the decline in production during 
1994 will be at least 10 percent with an inflation of 1000-1200 
percent. Taking into consideration the impending revaluation of 
capital stock and the increase in transportation costs and 
prices in the raw-material branches and fuel and energy complex, 
inflation could increase: 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Inflation, %                                                               |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The fact that the growth in prices, which has been 
accompanied by a reduction in investments in industry, 
significantly -- approximately 1.6-fold --outstrips the 
increases in prices in agriculture evokes special alarm. This 
creates the threat not only of a protracted decline in 
production but also of a further intensification of price and 
exchange disproportions between these two very important sectors 
of the national economy. The situation in this area really 
resembles the celebrated 1922-1923 price discrepancy. Whereas 
the gap between the prices of industrial and agricultural 
products was 340 percent in favor of industry during 1922 and 
1923, which cheapened the labor of the peasants and was one of 
the main reasons leading later on to a food dearth and the 
unwillingness of peasants to sell their products, the gap has 
reached 400 percent during the two years of these reforms 
(1992-1993). Thus, the gap in the price discrepancy between 
these branches has become even larger than it was during the 
crisis year of 1923. It could reach a full 500 percent in 1994. 
Today, for a peasant to be able to acquire the same amount of 
industrial products that he did in 1991, he must sell fivefold 
more crops than in 1991; to acquire tractors and grain 
harvesting equipment -- 20-fold more. 
  A forecast[.sup]1[/] of prices for the most important 
goods, which the Center for Studying the Price and Market 
Situation ("Tsenakor" EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN) made, reveals the 
following price index changes during the second quarter of 1994 
without considering the increase in expenditures connected with 
the rise in costs of the capital stock in industry as a result 
of its revaluation: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Gasoline                              |1.5-1.7                               |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The revaluation of capital stock will cause an increase in 
costs in industry and, consequently, the price gap with 
agriculture will increase even more. 
  Today, agriculture is losing approximately 45 percent of the 
national income created in it because of the price discrepancy. 
It is not surprising that many farms in such oblasts as 
Vladimir, Orel, Voronezh, Tambov, Kursk, and Bryansk did not 
acquire a single tractor during 1992-1993 as a result of this 
economic policy. On the whole, the agricultural capital-worker 
ratio has decreased by 36 percent and labor productivity by 
almost 20 percent during these years. Thus, the disproportions 
in exchange relations between industry and agriculture have 
reached their critical limit. Steady production cuts in many 
food items and their supplanting with imported food have begun. 
  The saturation of the Russian market with domestic food was 
approximately 82 percent in 1993, including 75 percent of the 
1991 level for animal husbandry products. This means that at 
least a fifth of the domestic market has given way to foreign 
commodity producers and we are expanding the economies of other 
states by curtailing our production. In order to prevent a 
further worsening of the state of affairs in agriculture, the 
state should intervene in the economic relations between 
agriculture and other sectors of the national economy and move 
to their regulation. However, this does not mean that one must 
without fail move to increasing purchase prices everywhere in 
order to eliminate the price disproportions arising between 
industry and agriculture. Under the conditions that have been 
created, any price increase for one product leads to inflation 
throughout the price system. It is advisable to eliminate the 
price disproportions between these sectors of the national 
economy not only by increasing purchase prices but also by 
reducing the prices for industrial products going to 
agriculture. For many industrial commodities, this can be done 
without pain to their producers since their profitability varies 
from 25 to 100 percent and more. In this case, the overall level 
of purchase prices can be increased by not more than 10 percent 
and subsidies to agriculture reduced to the minimum. They should 
be retained only for the production of a limited number of basic 
agricultural products. 
  Large disproportions in exchange relations have also arisen 
within industry itself between the processing and raw-material 
branches. The discrepancy in prices between these branches 
reached 180 percent in favor of the processing branches during 
the two years of reforms. As a result, coal and oil-extracting 
industry enterprises, for example, must today sell 1.8-fold more 
of their products than they sold in 1991 in order to acquire the 
same amount of equipment that they got in 1991. It is not 
surprising that labor productivity is falling in these branches 
and that many enterprises have not modernized for a long time 
and are on the verge of bankruptcy. Raw-material branch 
enterprises themselves are not interested in acquiring domestic 
equipment, preferring to sell their products abroad and purchase 
equipment there. 
  Serious disproportions have arisen in the fuel and energy 
complex branches. As is known, our industry, especially power 
engineering, has been mainly oriented for a long time toward the 
use of coal. All the major price and exchange ratios in the 
national economy have been built on the relationship to the 
price of coal. However, the liberalization of prices at one fell 
swoop led to upsetting the price ratios, which were keeping 
their balance, and the production processes, which were formed 
considering this. All coal-using enterprises -- and they 
represent approximately 70 percent of the total number of 
enterprises -- were placed in a difficult financial situation 
and forced to feverishly switch their production processes over 
to the use of other energy sources or shut down. 
  Thus, the question of equalizing price ratios on the basis 
of 
regulating exchange relations between branches should be the 
pivot for all the states' future economic policy. When 
consistently following a policy of economic liberalization and 
expansion of the branch's use of market relations, the state 
should be concerned about their long-term economic interests. 
That is why it is necessary to move toward regulating (including 
primarily economic regulation) the most important price ratios 
for the purposes of balancing economic growth and adjusting the 
equivalent exchange of work results between branches and 
producers. This can be done on the basis of price agreements 
concluded through the mediation and under the control of state 
bodies between enterprises (branches) participating in the 
output of end products. These agreements can be fully concluded 
for technological chains: TEK [fuel and energy complex] - 
transportation - TEK, TEK - metallurgy - machine building - TEK, 
etc. In this case, the low prices for services, for example, 
transport for the fuel and energy complex, can be compensated 
for by the distribution of fuel and energy to transport at low 
prices. 
  Financial policy also needs changes. The strict monetarist 
financial policy, on whose basis rests the idea of balancing the 
budget by systematic delays in paying wages, all-embracing price 
liberalization and high taxes, is already incapable of improving 
the financial and monetary system. It is losing its economic 
sense more and more, acquiring a narrow departmental nature and, 
like any departmental policy in the final analysis, is beginning 
to be at variance with the interests of expanding the national 
economy. 
  Without a doubt, one cannot improve the economy without a 
balanced budget. However, one should not reduce financial policy 
only to the achievement of this goal because the budget can also 
be balanced by organizing the disproportions which are hurling 
the national economy back dozens of years and worsening the 
population's social condition. That is why the problem of 
balancing the budget cannot be solved by any means -- by a 
landslide curtailment of production and the bankruptcy of an 
enormous number of enterprises -- since physical production is 
the main source for the receipt of the state's financial assets. 
However, the financial policy, which has been recently followed, 
has also contributed a great deal to this. Thus, the country's 
industrial potential decreased by 34 percent during the two 
years of the reforms and approximately 40,000 enterprises were 
chronically insolvent during 1993. As a result of the strict 
monetarist financial policy, which is limiting the issuing of 
credits, and the establishment of high taxes, which have led to 
a production curtailment, the sources for replenishing the 
budget have been reduced by almost 20 percent. The country has 
thereby been deprived of significant financial assets and the 
financial and monetary system itself has been destabilized even 
more. 
  Calculations show that with the further conducting of the 
selected financial policy in 1994, approximately 20 percent of 
all coal mines and metallurgical complex enterprises, 28 percent 
of machine building enterprises, 16 percent of the timber 
industry, 22 percent of printing plants, 32 percent of light 
industry, and 21 percent of the food industry could become 
bankrupt. This once again testifies that the financial policy 
should be changed. Its meaning should consist not of limiting 
the issuing of credits in every way possible and searching for 
additional taxes but of stimulating the expansion of production 
by the sensible use of existing financial assets, thereby 
contributing to expanding the base for new financial revenue for 
the budget. Entrepreneurs, who have invested their assets in 
expanding production facilities that are most profitable for 
them, have understood this for a long time. Unfortunately, the 
state is not doing this. The massive denationalization of 
enterprises and their transfer to private property without 
appropriate guarantees for their stable functioning and the 
insuring of tax receipts for the budget from their activity are 
occurring. As a result, tax receipts for the budget from 
privatized enterprises are being constantly reduced. They 
decreased by 17 percent during 1993. 
  It is necessary to introduce certain adjustments in order to 
expand the reforms successfully. First of all, we must 
strengthen the social orientation of the reforms so that the 
individual's interests occupy the central place in them, the 
expansion of production and the balancing of national economic 
priorities are done on this basis, credit emissions are carried 
out, and the financial and monetary system strengthened in the 
final analysis. All necessary conditions for this exist today.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Katsman: "The Banks Have Tried to </F>
Influence the Municipal Council at the Last Minute"] 
  [Text] The squabble around the decision of the Moscow 
municipal council to introduce a duty on exchange currency 
operations reached a culmination by the date of its proposed 
coming into force--1 March. Yesterday the managers of 108 
leading Russian banks which are shareholders and members of the 
Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange signed an open letter to the 
mayor of Moscow, Yuriy Luzhkov. In this appeal the bankers have 
again pointed out the negative consequences of the duty's 
introduction. 
  Almost a month has passed since the decision to introduce a 
duty on foreign currency operations was reached. During this 
time the criticisms addressed to the Moscow municipal council 
have become louder and louder. The leadership of the exchange 
itself spoke out repeatedly with verbal statements which 
foretold all but the crash of the Exchange. Yuriy Luzhkov also 
received a diplomatically irate letter from the chairman of the 
Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko. The appearance of the bankers' 
letter to the mayor on the eve of the municipal council's decree 
entering into force has been the culmination of events. 
  The gist of the letter comes down to four basic points. 
First: the lion's share of the country's exchange currency 
turnover goes through the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange 
and the introduction of a duty means the imposition of an 
additional tax on Russian importers and exporters. The former 
will be forced in this case to shift their additional costs to 
the consumers and a stimulus to conduct the obligatory sale of 
foreign currency earnings on other Russian exchanges will appear 
for the latter. This will appreciably reduce the Exchange's 
turnover. Second: it is precisely on the Moscow exchange that 
the Central Bank conducts operations to regulate the exchange 
rate of the national currency. With a reduction in the 
operations of the Moscow exchange it can lose the role of the 
"exchange rate forming" (kursoobrazuyushchiy) center of Russia. 
Third: the introduction of an additional duty worsens the 
already far from favorable tax climate in the capital and Moscow 
can altogether lose the status of the financial center of Russia. 
  And, finally, fourth. The bankers think that the financial 
problems of Moscow will not be solved by the introduction of 
additional duties and that the use of more civilized methods, 
for example the issuance of municipal bonds (similar to the GKO 
[not further identified]) is far more effective for increasing 
the revenues of the city's budget. 
  I didn't succeed in getting commentaries on the bank 
managers' letter from officials of the Moscow municipal council. 
They alluded to the fact that this document had not yet been 
officially received. However, it became obvious from the 
conversation with the bureaucrats that they are troubled not so 
much by the letter as by the problems of implementing the 
municipal council's decision. Considering the strong opposition 
to this decision on the part of the banks and the exchange 
itself and also that the mechanism for levying this tax has so 
far not been developed (in particular, even the payers of the 
duty have not been determined), one can infer that the decision 
of the capital's authorities will not enter into force in its 
original version in the near future and, most likely, will be 
transformed. 
<H3>  From the letter of the Russian Banks to the Mayor of Moscow, 
Luzhkov, Yu. M. </H3>
  In the name of the leading Russian banks which are 
shareholders and members of the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency 
Exchange, we would like to express to you our concern in 
connection with the decision recently adopted by the Moscow 
municipal Duma to introduce, as of 1 March 1994, a duty on 
transactions involving the buying and selling of foreign 
currency completed on the exchanges of the city of Moscow... 
  Being one of six Russian currency exchanges, the Moscow 
Inter-Bank Currency Exchange has concentrated more than 80 
percent of the country's currency exchange turnover. Some $12.6 
billion were sold last year at the auctions of the Moscow 
Inter-Bank Currency Exchange, which constituted approximately a 
third of Russian export currency earnings. Introduction of the 
new duty means that most Russian exporters will be subject to 
the additional tax..., which will stimulate their urge to 
conduct the obligatory sale... on regional currency exchanges. 
Importers also will suffer, since their expenditures for 
acquiring foreign currency on the Moscow exchange market will be 
significantly increased. It is natural that they will shift 
these costs to the consumers, having included them in the prices 
for imported goods... 
  It needs to be noted... that the Central Bank carries out 
currency interventions in support of the exchange rate of the 
national Russian currency most actively precisely on the Moscow 
Inter-Bank Currency Exchange and establishes the official ruble 
exchange rate... on the basis of the results of its exchange 
sessions. In the event that the decision adopted by the Duma is 
implemented... the Central Bank will be compelled to carry out 
policy regarding the regulation of the exchange rate on another 
currency exchange. The volumes of operations on the Moscow 
Inter-Bank Currency Exchange will drastically decline and it... 
will lose the role of the exchange rate forming center of 
Russia... 
  With the introduction of the duty the banks' costs with 
respect to exchange currency operations will double 
approximately, which will force the leading Russian banks to 
leave the Moscow market and to begin more active work in the 
regional centers, primarily in Saint Petersburg... From the 
curtailing of exchange currency operations in Moscow alone the 
municipal treasury can lose revenues received in the form of the 
35-percent tax on the profit of the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency 
Exchange, and in the process not receive the anticipated 
revenues from the duty being introduced. 
  According to its principles the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency 
Exchange is a non-commercial organization. Last year the bank's 
shareholders... directed the basic portion of the profit to the 
acquisition of modern technologies... for the further 
development of the Russian financial market, mainly the state 
securities market. At the present time, on the order of 100 
billion rubles is received into the state treasury every month 
from the floating of bond loans. Such an approach is a far more 
effective method of replenishing the municipal budget as 
compared to the introduction of a duty on currency operations 
(the receipts from which will shrink drastically together with 
the fall in the volume of exchange auctions)... The preparation 
of the Government of Moscow for the issuance of a municipal bond 
loan could become the model of a civilized approach to the 
financing of the municipal budget and the city's commercial 
banks are ready to assist the Government of Moscow in organizing 
the issuance and circulation of municipal bonds using the 
technical base of the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange. 
  We apply to You with a proposal about a joint search for 
well-considered and professionally grounded approaches... which 
can ensure not a reduction but an increase in the role of Moscow 
as the most important and most dynamically developing financial 
center of Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Chernov, Sigmatsentr consultant: "Did </F>
Russia Have a Budget in 1993?" 
  [Text] It would be worthwhile to hold parliamentary 
hearings on this subject with the participation of Boris 
Fedorov, the country's ex-treasurer. Or is no one in our 
government responsible for this as before? 
  The budget is more important than any political argument to 
very many people -- no matter what position they occupy. The 
incomes of the different categories of citizens and the amounts 
of taxes depend on the state budget and budgetary policy. 
  However, our liberal reformers have turned the budget into 
something secret and inaccessible. One can only explain with any 
distinctness the situation regarding the state budget in 1993 
using truisms. It, as it were, existed and did not exist 
simultaneously. There were drafts of the budget (delayed, true, 
for at least a half year); however, no final portrait can be 
obtained from them. No one discussed and adopted it. 
  Without a doubt, the entire year of 1993 was -- to put it 
mildly -- a strange one in a legal respect. Budget oddities were 
in no way fewer than constitutional legal ones. 
  The budget in the hands of Russia's ultra-liberals is 
surprisingly similar to the celebrated clothes of the king in 
the well-known fairy-tale -- first of all, probably because it 
has the property of not retaining fingerprints due to the 
ephemeral nature of the subject itself. A clever tailor was 
able to convince the king and his associates that he had cut out 
beautiful or, as the specialists say, almost deficit-free 
clothing. 
  Alas, the unsophisticated, like the fairy-tale infant, 
people 
incited by the vigilant "enemies of reform" were in no hurry for 
some reason to go into ecstasies over the stiff savings in their 
wages, pensions, subsidies, and other payments. The absence of 
certain essential -- from the viewpoint of social decency -- 
details in the budget clothing evoked among them an 
understandable wish to know where the more than sizable "pieces" 
of the monetary fabric had disappeared. 
  The people will hardly be satisfied with the recent 
explanation by B. Fedorov, the ex-treasurer. It seems that the 
agrarians, who punched through an "unrealistic" (too big, isn't 
it?) state order, and the prime minister, who confirmed a price 
for grain at the world level (but is it really at the world 
level?) are guilty of the wage underpayments by the budget 
people since the "breakdown of the budget began because money 
had to be taken from others." 
  The entire essence of his economic policy's ultra-liberalism 
and insolvency were expressed in this reasoning of the retired 
(fortunately) minister. From the viewpoint of liberal 
financiers, the budget would look much better if the Russian 
agrarians had not produced anything in general, if agriculture 
had ruined itself completely, if all grain had been purchased 
from American and other farmers paying for it with earnings from 
selling natural resources to the West, etc., etc. This liberal 
logic is so absurd and so abnormal that language does not exist 
to discuss it seriously from a worldly and scientific viewpoint. 
Nevertheless, we agreed for two years -- based on some evil 
intuition -- to listen to the barren flowers of liberalism. 
  Liberalism is back where it started but the deceived people 
are participating in these young people's gatherings. Only the 
fact that people are apparently no longer building on the 
liberal chaff is consoling. Liberal reformers will only be able 
to achieve the reverse effect -- intense attention on their 
affairs -- with reasoning similar to the one cited above. 
Citizens are continuing to remind the authorities about their 
legitimate interests and needs. Not trite reasoning by retirees 
but answers to simple questions interest them. 
  For example, with the supposedly existing acute shortage of 
assets, how could B. Fedorov, the ex-treasurer, admit that 
astronomic sums -- according to the estimates of experts, they 
exceed the state's annual budget several-fold --that have 
state-wide natural resources as their only source contrive by 
some incomprehensively devious way not to be in the state 
treasury but in private accounts in Swiss banks? 
  Upon whom has wealth of such frankly planetary scales fallen 
and how? What, in fact, was the state's budget? On the basis of 
what considerations and priorities was it compiled? How was it 
implemented? Was everything here straightforward from a legal 
and, moreover, from a moral point of view? 
  Peace and harmony in society cannot be based on deceit or a 
desire to close one's eyes to the abominations of life nor can 
they be built on vengeance. Only truth and the political 
morality based on it can be the basis of a civil harmony aimed 
at a just reorganization of life.

**December to December 


<H5>  Production and Use of Gross Domestic Product </H5>
  Gross Domestic Product [GDP], which is calculated as the 
difference between gross production and intermediate 
consumption, and characterizes the value of finished output 
destined for end consumption, accumulation, and export, totaled 
162.3 trillion rubles [R], down 12 percent compared with 1992. 
This was due to the fall in production of goods and services in 
most sectors of the economy, including falls of 16.2 percent in 
industry, 7 percent in construction, and 4 percent in 
agriculture. 
  In 1993 almost 58 percent of GDP was utilized for end 
consumption compared to 54 percent in 1992. The proportion of 
accumulation in GDP dropped 6.2 percent in 1993. 
<H6>  Industry </H6>
  Production dropped 16.2 percent in real terms compared with 
1992 -- 16.1 percent in December. Civilian output dropped 15.9 
percent and military production was down 29 percent (in 1992 the 
figures were 12 and 42 percent respectively). 
  In 1993 industrial production was down 37 percent on the 
1990 
figure, including drops of 28 and 38 percent in the extraction 
and processing sectors respectively. 
  During 1993 the greatest fall in production compared with 
the 
corresponding period in 1992 was recorded in January (down 21.8 
percent), the smallest in August (down 12 percent). 
  Production of 234 (89 percent) out of 262 categories of 
reported industrial output dropped, while production of 28 
categories (11 percent) rose. 
  The reduction in production differs substantially from 
sector 
to sector and production facility to production facility. 
Production of fuel and raw material resources dropped 3-12 
percent, investment output -- 20-40 percent, output destined for 
agriculture -- 22-41 percent, basic foodstuffs -- 10-24 percent, 
and light industry goods -- 13-34 percent. Production of 
certain categories of consumer durables rose 8-9 percent. 
  Last year it did not prove possible to carry out the 
comprehensive structural reorganization of industry and the 
sector's production structures tended to become more cumbersome. 
  In 1993 there was a substantial increase in lost work time 
owing to protracted stoppages at production units due to 
difficulties in selling output, lack of material resources, etc. 
Whereas in 1992 1,400 enterprises (6 percent of the total) 
stopped production for more than a single shift every month on 
average, in 1993 the figure rose to 2,500 enterprises (12 
percent), including complete production stoppages at 206 
enterprises. In 1993, 115 million man-days' work time were 
lost, 10 percent of the scheduled work time at the enterprises 
where the stoppages occurred; each industrial worker accounted 
for six lost working days. 
  Machine building, metal working, light industry, chemical, 
and petrochemical enterprises accounted for 84 percent of the 
total lost worktime. Half the stoppages were caused by 
difficulties in selling output owing to customers' insolvency 
and a fall in demand, while 38 percent were due to lack of 
material resources. At the same time, whereas in 1992 and early 
1993 the main cause of stoppages was lack of material resources, 
as of the second quarter of 1993 there was an increase in the 
proportion of losses due to difficulties in selling output, 
which rose to total 57 percent in the fourth quarter. 
  A high level of production concentration is characteristic 
of 
industry in the Russian Federation since in the past industry 
was geared to the development of large enterprises. 
  The bulk of industrial production is currently concentrated 
at large enterprises. Around 2 percent of industrial 
enterprises (with over 5,000 employees) produce over 40 percent 
of all output, production of which generates over half of all 
industrial profits. 
  The concentration of production has resulted in a situation 
where all production of trolleybuses, potato harvesting 
combines, scooters, diggers, tunneling combines, certain 
categories of rubber, cationic dyes, photographic film, and a 
whole set of other output is concentrated at one enterprise in 
Russia at present. 
  Oligolopoly is characteristic of many industrial sectors -- 
where production of a sizable proportion of similar output is 
concentrated at two to four major enterprises. Thus, for 
instance, dynamo steel is produced by three enterprises, which 
account for virtually all production of this product; four 
produce polystyrene and copolymers (96 percent), four produce 
agricultural vehicle tires (82 percent), two produce magnetic 
tape (100 percent), three produce soda ash (92 percent), and 
three produce motorized graders (100 percent). 
  The two-sided monopoly where you have one vendor and one 
customer in the marketplace is a kind of oligopoly. This 
situation has developed with regard to the production of truck 
engines produced by Volga Motor Plant produces; their only 
customer is the Gorkiy Automobile Plant Production Association. 
The mainline electric locomotives that are only produced by the 
Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant are all bought by the 
Russian Ministry of Railways. 
  In fuel and energy sectors, in standard equivalent terms, 
extraction and production of all categories of primary energy 
resources dropped 6 percent in 1993 compared with 1992. Some 
956 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity were produced (down 5 
percent on 1992) and 352 million tonnes of oil were extracted, 
including gas condensate (down 12 percent), along with 618 
billion cubic meters of gas (down 3 percent) and 305 million 
tonnes of coal (down 9 percent). 
  The drastic fall in oil extraction over the last few years 
has brought structural changes in the fuel balance. The 
proportion of oil, including gas condensate, in total fuel 
extraction dropped to 35 percent in 1993 compared with 42 
percent in 1990, while that of gas rose to 49 percent compared 
to 42 percent and coal remained virtually unchanged. 
  In ferrous metallurgy, production of basic output dropped in 
1993 owing to a fall in demand: 40.5 million tonnes of cast 
iron (down 12 percent on 1992) and 58.3 million tonnes of steel 
(down 13 percent) were smelted; 42.7 million tonnes of finished 
rolled metal (down 9 percent) and 5.8 million tonnes of steel 
pipe (down 28 percent) were produced. Production of many 
progressive categories of metal output dropped still further. 
The adverse structural changes in the sector's raw material 
base are continuing: "Vtormet" Joint-Stock Company organizations 
reduced procurement of scrap metal 34 percent compared with 
1992, while iron ore extraction was down 7 percent. As a result 
steel smelting is making greater use of cast iron and less of 
the relatively cheap scrap metal. 
  Production of many goods dropped substantially in machine 
building owing to the decline in customers' effective demand -- 
production of one-fourth of 62 most important categories of 
reported output was down 20-40 percent, while production of 
one-third of these goods was down 50 percent or more. 
  Production of high-technology output dropped, in particular 
metal cutting tools and forging and pressing machines with 
digital program control, which were down by a factor of 4-6. 
Production of railroad and agricultural machine building output 
and construction equipment was down (30-70 percent). 
  Production of automobile industry output, for which there is 
a relatively steady demand, dropped less. In 1993, 956,000 
passenger cars were produced (99.3 percent of the 1992 level) 
and 47,200 buses (98 percent). 
  Structural transformations in defense industry sectors in 
connection with the conversion of military production were a 
characteristic feature of last year. Whereas early in the year 
conversion encompassed 687 defense complex enterprises, at the 
end of the year the figure was 719, 68 percent of the total 
number of enterprises in these sectors. Overall production at 
enterprises undergoing conversion dropped 11 percent. 
Nonmilitary output at enterprises undergoing conversion 
represented around three-fourths of their total output. 
Two-thirds of the work force are employed in producing this 
output. 
  Compared with 1992 there have been changes in the funding 
structure for conversion. The amount of federal budget 
appropriations has dropped somewhat (from 24 to 18 percent), 
while the proportion of raised funds, including bank credit and 
foreign investment, has risen (from 31 to 48 percent). 
  The decline in production in the chemical and petrochemical 
industry in 1993 is due to limited raw materials and 
semimanufactures, both Russian and from nearby and distant 
foreign countries (one-fourth of the sector's consumption). 
Some 9.9 million tonnes of synthetic ammonia (down 7 percent on 
1992), 8.2 million tonnes of sulfuric acid (down 15 percent), 2 
million tonnes of soda ash (down 26 percent), 1.4 million tonnes 
of caustic soda (down 22 percent), 8.6 million tonnes of mineral 
fertilizers (down 22 percent), 349,000 tonnes of chemical fibers 
and yarns (down 26 percent), and 36.1 million automobile tires 
(down 14 percent) were produced. 
  The chemical and pharmaceutical industry cut production of 
11 
out of 16 highly important pharmacotherapeutic groups of 
preparations, including cancer preparations, analgesics, 
febrifuges, antipyretics, anti-TB preparations, antiasthmatics, 
antihistamines, preparations for the treatment of dysbacteriosis 
[disbakterioz], eye disease, and endocrinological and digestive 
complaints. Production of preparations for the treatment of 
sugar diabetes, as well as contrast mediums and other diagnostic 
aids, has been suspended. Substances which are in increased 
demand among the population have become scarce: nitroglycerine, 
papaverine, and vitamins, production of which was at 86-93 
percent of the 1992 level; levomycetin, analgine, and validol, 
at 61-68 percent of the 1992 level; and klofelin [translation 
unknown] and ampicillin, at 48-54 percent of the 1992 level. 
  In the timber procurement industry commercial timber 
production dropped by more than one-fourth compared with 1992. 
That is due to high equipment wear-out rates, a reduction in 
the construction of timber-carrying roads, too-late allocation 
of credit, and increased shipment costs. 
  There has been a considerable fall in production of the most 
important categories of timber processing and pulp and paper 
output. In 1993, production of lumber totaled 39.9 million 
cubic meters (25 percent down on the 1992 level), pit props -- 
450,000 cubic meters (down 55 percent), commercial pulp -- 1.6 
million tonnes (down 21 percent), and paper -- 2.9 million 
tonnes (down 20 percent). 
  A reduction in industrial construction brought a reduction 
in 
production in the construction materials industry. Some 50.1 
million tonnes of cement (down 19 percent on 1992), 3,249 
million standard slates (down 28 percent), 19.1 billion bricks 
(down 12 percent), and 101 million square meters of window glass 
(down 13 percent) were produced. 
  Production of general construction materials and goods 
dropped to a lesser extent: Production of panels for 
large-panel housing construction, steel wall and roofing panels, 
ceramic facing slates, and construction glass dropped 13-26 
percent, and production of ceramic sanitary ware was down 7 
percent. 
  In 1993, light industry enterprises produced 3.7 billion 
square meters of fabric (27 percent down on 1992), 547 million 
pairs of hosiery (down 13 percent), 340 million items of 
knitwear (down 26 percent), and 146 million pairs of footwear 
(down 34 percent). 
  Structural changes can be glimpsed in the sector in terms of 
an increase in production of output for high-income population 
groups, Thus, in 1993 there was virtually no fall in the 
production of real fur overcoats for adults compared with 1992 
at a time when production of fake fur and cloth overcoats 
dropped 52 and 28 percent respectively. 
  Over the year production of children's goods dropped most: 
hosiery and knitwear by almost one-third and footwear by half. 
  A different situation developed with regard to the 
production 
of cultural-consumer and household goods. In 1993, 3.5 million 
refrigerators and freezers (9 percent up on 1992), 4 million 
television sets (8 percent up), 3.9 million washing machines 
(down 10 percent), 1.4 million sewing machines (down 13 
percent), 2.2 million tape players (down 20 percent), and 
270,000 videocassette recorders (down 39 percent on 1992) were 
produced. 
  The fall in production of a number of commodities, 
videocassette recorders and tape players in particular, is due 
to the increased supply of high-quality imports on the consumer 
market. 
  Enterprises producing china and majolica operated fairly 
stably last year, although by the end of the year production was 
tending to drop (99.7 percent). Production of cast-iron ferrous 
and drawn aluminum vessels more than halved. In 1993 ski 
production was only 30 percent of the 1992 level, including 18 
percent for children's skis. Production of many sports goods 
dropped. 
  In 1993 the drop in production of certain foodstuffs slowed 
down: 4.0 million tonnes of meat, 8.2 million tonnes of 
whole-milk products, 1.1 million tonnes of vegetable oil, and 
3.9 million tonnes of sugar were produced. 
  Production of vegetable oil, prepared meat products, fatty 
cheeses, sheep's cheese, canned milk products, and mayonnaise 
rose. 
  With regard to babyfood in 1993 production of liquid and 
pureed dairy products, dried milk mixtures, canned meat, fruit, 
and vegetables totaled just 26-49 percent of the targets 
prescribed by the State Program for the Development of the 
Babyfood Industry, while production of cereal-based dried foods 
was just 14 percent of the prescribed level. Compared with 1992 
production of liquid and pureed dairy products rose. However, 
production of these products dropped in 50 percent of regions. 
The situation that has developed with regard to the production 
of babyfood is due to enterprises' lack of packaging and 
wrapping materials supplied by nearby and distant foreign 
countries and also to trading organizations' rejection of 
babyfood owing to the high price thereof. 
<H6>  Capital Construction </H6>
  In 1993 Russian enterprises under all forms of ownership 
absorbed R25.2 trillion in capital investment. 
  Enterprises' own funds (over 60 percent of all capital 
investments) are the main source of funding for capital 
construction. Centralized funds financed by the republic's 
budget account for 17.5 percent, local budget funds for 15 
percent, investment funds for 3.3 percent, and preferential 
credit for 1.7 percent. 
  State enterprises and organizations (59 percent) and 
joint-stock companies (29 percent as opposed to 6.7 percent in 
1992) account for the largest proportion of capital invested. 
  Some R15 trillion or 60 percent of all capital investments 
were utilized on the construction of production facilities. The 
largest proportion of production investment is channeled into 
the development of the fuel and energy complex (around 40 
percent), the agro-industrial complex (18 percent), machine 
building (7 percent), and the chemical, timber, and construction 
complexes (5 percent each). 
  Some 193 of the 652 federal investment program facilities 
due 
for commissioning in 1993 were been commissioned (122 in full 
and 71 in part). The level of program fulfillment totaled 30 
percent, including 42 percent for budget-funded facilities and 
26 percent for facilities funded by credit investment resources. 
  The agro-industrial complex spent R4.1 trillion in capital 
investment from all sources of funding, down one-third on 1992. 
State budget funds accounted for one-fifth of the total 
investment in the agro-industrial complex. Some 42 highly 
important agro-industrial complex facilities were commissioned 
in 1993 from this source of funding under federal investment 
programs (13 percent of the annual program if you include 
partial commissioning,). 
  Unfinished construction is continuing to build up. In 1993 
the amount of unfinished construction is estimated to have 
increased by 20-25 percent. Production facilities account for 
over two-thirds of this. 
  In 1993 the rate of nonproduction construction dropped less 
than that in the production sphere, making it possible to 
somewhat increase the amount of housing and a number of other 
social facilities that were commissioned compared with 1992. 
  In 1993 enterprises under all forms of ownership built 
apartment blocks with a total area of 41.8 million square meters 
or 100.7 percent of the 1992 level (68 percent of the 1990 
level). 
  State enterprises and organizations commissioned 22.0 
million 
square meters or 99.1 percent of the 1992 level and 53 percent 
of the total amount of housing built. 
  The nonstate sector of the economy built 2 percent more 
housing than in 1992. At the same time the situation with 
regard to housing construction by joint-stock companies (up 4 
percent on 1992), economic partnerships (up 11 percent), and 
individual developers (up 13 percent) developed most favorably. 
  Enterprises and organizations under all forms of ownership 
commissioned general education schools with 299,600 places (1 
percent down on 1992), preschool establishments with 61,500 
places (36 percent down), hospitals with 14,300 beds (75 percent 
up), and outpatient clinics catering for 45,900 patients per 
shift (up 16 percent). 
<H6>  Agriculture </H6>
  Within the framework of the agrarian reform in Russia in 
1993 
the reorganization of kolkhozes and sovkhozes continued, lands 
were redistributed and privatized, and social and structural 
transformations were accomplished. 
  By the end of 1993 over 24,000 kolkhozes and sovkhozes had 
been reregistered, which is 95 percent of their total. Various 
types of partnership have become the main organizational form of 
management (there are 11,500 of them). Around 300 open-type 
joint-stock companies, over 400 subsidiary plots of enterprises 
and organizations, 2,000 agricultural cooperatives, and 3,000 
other enterprises of new organizational-legal forms of 
management have been created on the basis of the reorganized 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes. The collectives of one farm in three 
have adopted a decision to preserve the status of their 
enterprise. At present agricultural enterprises with a state 
form of ownership account for no more than 15 percent of 
agricultural lands and value of produce. 
  The creation of new peasant (private) farms in 1993 
proceeded 
more slowly. In the year as a whole their number increased by 
87,000 (in 1992 by 134,000) and by 1 January 1994 totaled 
270,000 with a land area of 11.3 million hectares (an average of 
42 hectares per farm). Agricultural land on those farms 
occupies 10.4 million hectares (92 percent of the total) with 
plowland forming 7.5 million hectares (66 percent). Private 
farmers held 5 percent of the country's agricultural land and 6 
percent of the plowland. 
  Because of the increased difficulties with material and 
technical support, the deterioration of the financial position, 
and other factors 14,000 private farms stopped trading in 1993, 
5,000 of them in the fourth quarter (5,000 closed down in the 
whole of 1992). Out of every 100 farms created in 1993 14 
peasant holdings ceased operations as against four in 1992. 
  The allocation of land for collective horticulture and truck 
farming continued. In 1993 over 0.8 million families received 
plots on collective horticultural farms with an area of 
approximately 80,000 hectares and 3.0 million families received 
a total of 200,000 hectares on truck farms. Land was also 
allocated for personal plots and dacha construction. 
  The land redistribution processes predetermined the 
structural changes in agriculture. 
  The proportion of gross agricultural output, in value terms, 
produced by the population's farms increased from 24 percent in 
1990 to 36 percent in 1993, areas sown to potatoes increased 
accordingly from 58 percent to 77 percent, and vegetables from 
34 percent to 60 percent. In 1993 the population grew over 80 
percent of the potatoes and 66 percent of the vegetables. The 
potato yield on the population's plots was noticeably higher 
than on agricultural enterprises. Similar processes are 
occurring in stockraising. The private sector's share of meat 
production rose in the past three years from 25 percent to 38 
percent, of milk production from 24 percent to 34 percent, and 
of egg production from 22 percent to 27 percent. Cattle 
productivity on personal plots is also higher than the level in 
agricultural enterprise livestock units. 
  According to the preliminary figures, the volume of gross 
agricultural production in 1993 in comparable prices fell by 4 
percent compared with the previous year while on the 
population's private subsidiary plots the value of gross output 
rose by 4 percent. 
  In 1993, 99 million tonnes of grain were harvested (93 
percent of the 1992 level). The harvests of sugar beets (25.5 
million tonnes), potatoes (38.1 million tonnes), and vegetables 
(9.8 million tonnes) were approximately at the 1992 level. The 
gross harvest of sunflowers for seed was 2.8 million tonnes (11 
percent less than in 1992) while for flax the figure was 58,000 
tonnes (26 percent down). The sowing of winter crops and the 
fall plowing were noticeably behind the 1992 performance. An 
area of 15.5 million hectares of winter crops were sown (20 
percent down on 1992) and that included 14.3 million hectares of 
grain (20 percent less). The decline in the area sown to winter 
rye was higher (34 percent) while that of wheat (12 percent) and 
barley (6 percent) was lower. Some 41.9 million hectares of 
fall plowing was carried out, which is 6.2 million hectares (or 
13 percent) less than in fall 1992. 
  In 1993 state resources received 27.4 million tonnes of 
grain 
or 1.3 million tonnes (5 percent) more than in 1992. The 
proportion of grain purchased was 28 percent of production as 
against 24 percent the previous year. Wheat purchases rose by 
16 percent compared with 1992, purchases of oats rose 14 
percent, and purchases of barley and peas were up 30 percent. 
The sale of groat crops to the state fell by one-third, rye by 
a quarter, and strong and durum (high grade) wheat were down by 
two-thirds. 
  Some 11.5 million tonnes of grain (97 percent of the set 
target), 0.5 million tonnes of oil-bearing seeds (43 percent), 
and 3.1 million tonnes of sugar beets (41 percent) were bought 
for supply to the federal fund. 
  Crop sale patterns changed in 1993. A reduction can be 
observed in the proportion of output supplied to the state, 
while sales through other channels are expanding. For example, 
state resources received 28 percent of the sugar beet harvest 
and 21 percent of the sunflower seed crop as against 42 percent 
and 38 percent respectively in the previous year. There was an 
increase in the proportion of these crops sold by commodity 
producers on a customer-supplied basis to processing 
enterprises. The supply of sugar beets by this method rose from 
50 percent of sales volume in 1992 to 65 percent, while the 
figure for sunflowers rose from 25 percent to 68 percent. Sales 
of potatoes and vegetables by all agricultural commodity 
producers fell by 20-30 percent compared with the previous year. 
In 1993 they sold 28-45 percent of the total produce sold 
through free channels (the market, own stores, public catering 
outlets, and so forth) (in 1992 the figure was 24-27 percent). 
  Stockraising in 1993 was characterized by a decline in the 
receipt of produce from agricultural enterprises' farms and a 
simultaneous increase in production on citizens' private 
subsidiary plots. On farms of all categories meat production 
fell by 860,000 tonnes in live weight (a 7-percent reduction) 
compared with 1992, egg production was down 2.6 billion (6 
percent), and wool production was down 18,500 tonnes (10 
percent). The decline in milk production has been halted: 
Production was at the previous year's level. 
  As of 1 January 1994 the number of livestock on all 
categories of farms was 48.9 million head (6 percent less than 
on the same date in 1993), the cow herd totaled 19.8 million (2 
percent down), there were 28.5 million hogs (10 percent down) 
and 43.6 million sheep and goats (15 percent fewer). At the 
same time the herd on the population's plots increased as 
follows: beef cattle [krupnyy rogatyy skot] -- 4 percent, dairy 
cattle [korova] -- 6 percent, and pigs -- 2 percent. 
  The proportion of beef cattle owned by citizens rose in the 
last three years from 17 percent to 25 percent, of dairy cattle 
from 25 percent to 34 percent, of hogs from 18 percent to 28 
percent, and of sheep and goats from 28 percent to 38 percent. 
  Insufficient and unbalanced feed was the main reason for the 
poor use of the potential of livestock. Livestock productivity 
in Russia remains two-three times below the genetic potential 
and equivalent indicators for developed foreign countries. 
  Volumes of state purchases of livestock and poultry were 5.9 
million tonnes in 1993 (85 percent of the 1992 level), milk -- 
24.6 million tonnes (94 percent), and eggs -- 24.2 billion (99.5 
percent). The proportion of state purchases in the total volume 
of livestock product sales by agricultural commodity producers 
remained virtually unchanged at 80-90 percent in comparison with 
the previous year. 
<H5>  Transport and Communications </H5>
  In 1993 the reduction of freight shipments was a consequence 
of the continuing decline in the production of output. The 
volume of freight shipments by general-purpose transport fell by 
1.2 billion tonnes in comparison with 1992 (down by 25 percent) 
and totaled 3.6 billion tonnes. Freight shipment by rail fell 
by 18 percent, road transport was down 40 percent, maritime 
transport was down 8 percent, inland water transport was down 31 
percent, air transport was down 23 percent, and pipeline 
transport was down 8 percent. 
  The shipment of freight by general-use inland water 
transport 
to the Far North and equivalent locations ended in October. 
From the start of the navigation season 35 million tonnes of 
freight were shipped to those regions by river transport, which 
is 24 percent less than in 1992, and around 8 million tonnes 
were shipped by sea (28 percent less). 
  The number of passengers carried by general-use transport 
fell 5 percent compared with 1992. A proportion of passenger 
traffic was switched to relatively cheaper rail transport, where 
passenger numbers increased by 7 percent. Road passenger 
traffic fell by 6 percent, inland water passenger traffic fell 
16 percent, and air passenger traffic was down 29 percent. In 
air transport passenger traffic on internal routes was down 37 
percent whereas on international routes it rose by 29 percent. 
  Public transport rolling stock is in bad technical 
condition. 
At least one-tenth of the registered fleet of passenger cars and 
street cars and trolleys are being used beyond the end of their 
operational life. At general-use motor transport establishments 
almost one third of buses have depreciated completely and are 
due to be written off. The constantly rising transport tariffs 
do not cover the costs of transport enterprises and do not 
enable them to update the vehicle fleet. As a result the number 
of vehicles in use on the roads is falling and routes are being 
canceled or reduced. In December one regional center in four 
failed to fulfill more than 15 percent of planned bus, trolley, 
and street car journeys. Public taxi transport has become 
virtually unaffordable for the population and the volume of 
journeys halved over the year. 
  The quality of passenger services remains low. In 1993, 32 
million bus journeys were canceled and 4.7 million buses were 
late arriving at their final destination. Some 27 percent of 
internal flights failed to keep to schedule, and the average 
delay was over five hours. In rail transport in 1993, 36,000 
trains (8 percent) (leaving aside suburban trains) were late on 
average 1.1 hours. 
  The year 1993 saw the further development of communications 
networks and facilities, and this applies first and foremost to 
intercity and international telephone communications. An 
international telephone complex has been launched. A 24-hour 
outgoing automatic exchange has been opened for all subscribers 
in Moscow and St. Petersburg. In 70 cities in Russia 
international high-speed postal communications services are 
being offered. At the same time, a check carried out by the 
statistical organs has revealed substantial violations of the 
delivery deadlines. 
  Over the year communications enterprises provided services 
worth R1.6 trillion, including services to the population 
totaling R314 billion, which is 12 times more in actual current 
prices than in 1992. At the same time the volume of 
communications services in real terms continues to decline. In 
comparison with 1992 the number of letters and printed items 
sent fell by 24 percent, parcel traffic fell by 45 percent, 
money transfers, newspapers, and magazines (subscription and 
retail sales) were down by 31 percent, and telegrams were down 
17 percent. 
  More than 11 million applications for the installation of 
domestic telephones remain unsatisfied. The problem of 
providing the population with a telephone service is aggravated 
by the fact that in a number of cases citizens have been forced 
to forego the installation of a telephone on grounds of cost. 
<H5>  The Consumer Market </H5>
  Last year the trade and services sphere adapted increasingly 
to the new conditions. Enterprise is gaining momentum in the 
consumer market. In 1993 the population bought goods and 
services through all forms of sale worth R65.2 trillion (the 
statistics on the volume of sales of consumer goods and services 
to the population are cited on the basis of an expert assessment 
of volumes of sales at nonregistered enterprises and also in the 
light of the informal import and sale of consumer goods by 
private individuals), which in actual prices is 10.7 times 
higher than in 1992 and in comparable prices is virtually at the 
1992 level (a reduction of 0.5 percent). Around 40 percent of 
this volume constitutes expenditure on the acquisition of 
consumer goods and services in informal trading. 
  In comparison with 1992 the supply of goods to the retail 
trade network increased. Whereas in 1992 the retail 
availability coefficient was approximately 50 percent for food 
products and 70 percent for nonfood goods, in 1993 it was equal 
to 60-70 percent and 80-90 percent. The retail trade commodity 
supply index fluctuated around the 120-130 percent level 
compared with 1992. 
  Private-sector (including consumer cooperative) trade's 
share 
of retail commodity turnover was 71 percent (62 percent in 
1992), the state sector formed 25 percent (37 percent), and 
other nonstate forms of ownership made up 4 percent (1 percent). 
  In 1993 the population bought foodstuffs worth R31.3 
trillion. A proportion of the population is moving from 
organized trade to informal trade for the purchase of 
foodstuffs: In a number of instances prices are lower in 
informal trade. For example, while purchases of meat products, 
sugar, and vegetable oil rose by 12-26 percent and dairy 
products by 6 percent, in the organized trade sector sales fell 
by 4-15 percent. 
  The enforced redistribution of the population's money 
incomes 
in favor of the purchase of foodstuffs in 1992 restricted demand 
in the nonfood goods market. As money incomes rose and the 
population adapted to the new prices in 1993 a definite change 
occurred in the structure of retail commodity turnover; the 
proportion of food goods fell from 55 percent to 53 percent, 
while nonfood goods rose from 45 percent to 47 percent. In 1993 
the population bought nonfood goods worth R27.5 trillion, which 
in real prices is 11 times higher than in 1992. There was an 
increase in demand for many light industry products. In 
conditions when the production of these goods by our country's 
industry fell, the supply to the consumer market was largely 
maintained by means of expensive products and an increase in 
foreign purchases by commercial structures. 
  In comparison with 1992 purchases of footwear, knitted 
underwear, hosiery, cotton goods, woollens, and silk fabrics 
increased (1.1 to 1.5 times). Demand for domestic equipment was 
maintained. The sale of TV sets, refrigerators, freezers, and 
radio sets in organized trade rose by 19-26 percent. 
  In 1993 the population received paid services worth R6.4 
trillion, which in real prices is 12 times higher than the 1992 
level but in comparable prices is 30 percent lower. The volume 
of sales of domestic services was R1.1 trillion, which in real 
terms is 38 percent down on 1992. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Ties With Non-CIS Countries </H5>
  In 1993 Russia's foreign trade turnover (excluding CIS 
countries) including the import and export of goods by private 
individuals was $70 billion or a reduction of 12 percent in 
current prices compared with 1992. 
  Exports amounted to $43 billion, an increase of 1.4 percent, 
and the breakdown was as follows: to the industrially developed 
countries -- $25 billion (an increase of 1.2 percent); to the 
developing countries -- $6 billion (an increase of 39 percent); 
and the rest of the world (the former CEMA countries, the former 
Yugoslav republics, China, the DPRK, and the Baltic countries) 
-- $12 billion (a reduction of 5 percent). 
  The main volumes of export deliveries in 1993 went to 
Germany 
-- $5.8 billion (97 percent of 1992's figure); China -- $3.3 
billion (118 percent); Italy -- $2.8 billion (93 percent); 
Britain -- $2 billion (92 percent); Hungary -- $2.1 billion (138 
percent); Japan -- $2 billion (130 percent); the United States 
-- $2.0 billion (267 percent); France -- $1.8 billion (87 
percent); Czech Republic -- $1.6 billion (90 percent); Finland 
-- $1.6 billion (96 percent); Austria -- $1.5 billion (210 
percent); and Switzerland -- $1.5 billion (168 percent). 
  Fuel and energy resources accounted for 48 percent of the 
export commodity structure in 1993, with crude oil accounting 
for 19.1 percent, natural gas for 17.0 percent, and petroleum 
products for 8.0 percent, while machinery and equipment 
accounted for 6.7 percent of the total export volume. 
  In 1993 Russia's imports were worth $27 billion, 27 percent 
down on 1992, including $16.4 billion from the industrially 
developed countries (down 31 percent), $2.9 billion from the 
developing countries (down 39 percent) and $7.7 billion from the 
remaining countries (11 percent down on 1992). 
  Imports from Germany were worth $6.6 billion (96 percent of 
the 1992 figure), China -- $4.1 billion (228 percent) Japan -- 
$1.5 billion (89 percent), the United States -- $1.5 billion (52 
percent), France -- $1.2 billion (90 percent), and Italy -- $1.0 
billion (34 percent). Volumes of imports from Belgium, Britain, 
the Netherlands, Turkey, and Switzerland rose. Purchase of 
output in such countries as Bulgaria, Canada, the Republic of 
Korea, Romania, Singapore, and Sweden fell to half or less. 
  Machinery and equipment accounted for 26.5 percent of the 
total import volume in 1993, grain accounted for 5.8 percent, 
textiles and knitwear accounted for 4.5 percent, and sugar 
(including raw sugar) 3.0 percent. 
  In 1993 the foreign trade balance showed a surplus of $16.0 
billion (in 1992 the surplus was $5.4 billion). 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Ties with Neighboring Foreign Countries </H5>
  In accordance with intergovernmental agreements concluded by 
Russia with the former Union republics, a definite mechanism of 
trade and economic relations was formed between them which 
operated in 1993. However, the crisis state of the economy, the 
fall in production, and the reorientation of enterprises' 
economic ties toward the rest of the world caused a further 
decline in Russia's commodity turnover with the CIS states. 
Foreign trade turnover with the neighboring foreign countries 
in 1993 was R22.5 trillion or only 50 percent of the 1991 level. 
In the same period Russian oil deliveries to the CIS states 
fell by 60 percent, natural gas supplies were down by 8 percent, 
coal was down 68 percent, motor gasoline was down 60 percent, 
and rolled metals were down 64 percent. Russia's priority 
export commodity is fuel resources (88 percent of the volume of 
production and technical output exported as against 51 percent 
in 1992). 
  In 1993 the total commodity turnover volume with the CIS 
countries using the mechanism of equivalent supplies on a 
balanced basis in which payments are made using the price level 
in the world market, was almost $7 billion. 
  The CIS states' debt to Russia converted into 
[pereoformlennaya v] state debt was R2.3 trillion (approximately 
U.S. $5 billion). The possibility of settling part of the debt 
by the transfer of property rights (shares, securities, and so 
forth) to enterprises and installations of interest to Russia is 
envisaged here. 
  The total debt of enterprises and organizations of the CIS 
countries for supplies of goods under direct ties from Russia 
amounted to around R3.5 trillion by the end of 1993 of which 
approximately R1.5 trillion constituted debts to enterprises in 
Russia's fuel and energy complex. 
  The partial settlement of these debts is being achieved by 
state credits granted by Russia to the CIS countries. In 
addition, when payments are made it is anticipated that broader 
use will be made of payments in national currencies based on the 
quoted exchange rate for those currencies. 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  In January-November 39,000 state enterprises were 
privatized, 
and since privatization in Russia began 86,000 enterprises have 
been privatized. Of the total number of enterprises privatized 
in the first 11 months of 1993, 31 percent have passed into 
private ownership by means of flotation (partial or complete), 
69 percent by sale. 
  Retail and wholesale trade enterprises account for 35 
percent 
of the total privatized, industrial enterprises for 29 percent, 
consumer services enterprises for 18 percent, construction 
enterprises for 9 percent, public catering enterprises for 7 
percent, road transport enterprises for 3 percent, and 
agricultural enterprises for 2 percent. 
  The total value of enterprises privatized in January-October 
(according to residual value in prices prior to the revaluation 
of fixed assets in 1992) was over R753 billion. 
  On average the value of a single privatized enterprise in 
municipal ownership was R12 million, in territorial ownership -- 
R16 million, and in federal ownership -- R54 million. 
  Of the three forms of concessions offered to labor 
collectives during flotation of enterprises the preference, as 
before, is for option two, which enables the labor collective to 
own the controling stake. That option has been chosen by over 
three-quarters of enterprises which have become joint-stock. 
One-sixth of enterprises opted for flotation version three and 
around 1 percent have opted for version one. In addition, a 
proportion of enterprises (3.3 percent) have opted for flotation 
as lease enterprises. 
  The privatization of large and medium enterprises is being 
accomplished mainly by flotation. Of those enterprises 
privatized by flotation in January-November the controlling 
stake is assigned to the state at 305 of them (2.7 percent), and 
the state retains a "golden" share at a further 158 enterprises 
(1.4 percent). Of the total number of such enterprises the 
majority are in industry (54 percent) and in construction (12 
percent). 
  Privatization of small-scale enterprises is carried out as a 
rule by sale and virtually without restriction from the state. 
Some 44 percent of enterprises have been sold off by competitive 
tender, 43 percent by buy-outs of leased property, and 9 percent 
of enterprises by auction. 
  The average value rating [kurs stoimosti] of the enterprises 
which have been sold (the ratio of sale price to initial price) 
in January-November was 5.7 (in 1992 the figure was 3.2); for 
enterprises in municipal ownership the figure was 7.2, in 
territorial ownership -- 3.8, and in federal ownership -- 2.3. 
  Of those enterprises which have been floated 13 percent have 
sold all the shares available for sale, and of those enterprises 
privatized by means of sale more than three-quarters have paid 
the whole purchase sum due under contract. 
  The privatization of enterprises in January-November 
produced 
R340 billion (including resources for enterprises privatized in 
1992) and 40 million privatization checks. 
  The privatization of enterprises in municipal ownership 
generated R181 billion (53 percent of the money received) and 
6.2 million checks (16 percent of the total number of 
privatization checks redeemed), those in territorial ownership 
raised R56 billion (17 percent) and 9.6 million checks (24 
percent) correspondingly, and those in federal ownership raised 
R103 billion (30 percent) and 24.2 million checks (60 percent). 
Of the money raised 64 percent has been transferred to the 
budgets of the territories as revenue, 20 percent to the federal 
budget, and 16 percent to the state privatization organs. 
<H5>  Development of Market Structures </H5>
  The development of the Russian Federation's market 
infrastructure is undergoing a certain change at the moment. A 
gradual reduction in the number of commodity exchanges is being 
noticed. Out of the 303 licensed exchanges around 180 were in 
operation at the end of 1993, 40 of which were doing stable work 
and held auctions twice or more a week. 
  The bulk of the commodity turnover at exchanges (40 percent) 
is accounted for by the six largest exchanges, four of which are 
in Moscow and one each in Saratov and Omsk. 
  According to the preliminary figures, total commodity 
exchange turnover in 1993 amounted to R1.6 trillion, which was 
4.5 times higher than the 1992 turnover in current prices. The 
proportion of production and technical output in the structure 
of commodity exchange turnover fell (from 65 percent to 41 
percent) and consumer goods fell (from 31 percent to 12 percent). 
  In 1993 contracts began to be concluded for the purchase and 
sale of future supplies of output, which represented 6 percent 
of the total annual turnover. 
  Individual exchanges began to specialize in the sale of 
certain commodities. During the year 70 percent of commodity 
exchange business in oil was conducted at the Moscow Petroleum 
Exchange, 60 percent of dealings in wheat were conducted at the 
Russian Grain Exchange (Saratov), almost 50 percent of the coal 
was sold at the Siberian Commodity Exchange (Novosibirsk), 75 
percent of the nickel and over 40 percent of the aluminum were 
traded at the Moscow Nonferrous Metals Exchange, and 40 percent 
of trading in timber was handled at the "Roslesbirzha" (Moscow). 
However, the volumes of commodity dealings in the production of 
that output remain insignificant, ranging from 0.1 percent to 
1.5 percent. 
  Operations involving money and securities expanded at stock 
exchanges. The volume of their sales in total stock exchange 
turnover rose from 3 percent in 1992 to 46 percent in 1993. 
  By the end of 1993 around 2,000 commercial and cooperative 
banks holding Bank of Russia operating licenses, plus around 
4,000 branches (excluding the Savings Bank of the Russian 
Federation), had been registered. 
  In 1993 there were approximately 1.4 commercial banks per 
100,000 inhabitants: If branches of the Savings Bank are 
included that figure is 25-30 banking establishments per 100,000 
inhabitants. 
  The density of commercial banks by individual regions of 
Russia varies. Moscow remains the leader in terms of the 
provision of banking services. According to the figures for the 
first half-year, 38 percent of all registered banks and their 
branches are concentrated in the capital and Moscow has more 
than 22 commercial banks and branches per 100,000 inhabitants. 
In the Far East region and Kaliningrad Oblast the figure is 
four to six banks each, elsewhere the figure is one to two banks. 
  Of the total number of commercial banks around one-third 
have 
been organized on the basis of former specialist banks and over 
60 percent are new formed. 
  Commercial banks account for 80 percent of total credit 
investments in the national economy. 
  The traditional source of resources for the commercial banks 
-- funds which they manage to attract [privlechennyye sredstva] 
-- remains the main one (over 90 percent of liabilities), of 
which the resources of enterprises and organizations in clearing 
[raschetnyy] accounts and current and other accounts, deposits, 
and investments account for 25-27 percent of liabilities and 
interbank credits account for less than one fifth. Centralized 
credits of the Bank of Russia are prevalent in the latter 
category. 
  The main directions in the use of bank resources are the 
provision of credit (over one-third of assets were used for 
this) and investments in foreign operations (around one-half of 
assets). 
  The insurance services market in 1992-1993 saw an active 
process of forming a competitive environment. The formation and 
development of this market is an important factor ensuring 
stability in the activity of economic players and citizens' 
property interests. 
  In October 1993 the Russian State Committee for Statistics 
carried out a one-shot survey of the activity of 900 Russian 
insurance organizations (constituting 89 percent of the total 
number of firms with licenses to carry out insurance activity). 
Most of them -- over three-fourths -- are closed-type 
joint-stock companies and limited-liability partnerships, while 
one-sixth are open-type joint-stock companies. Firms in mixed 
ownership predominate -- 49 percent of the total number of firms 
-- 36 percent are in private ownership, 10 percent are in state 
ownership, and 5 percent are in municipal ownership or are owned 
by public organizations. 
  Most of the companies (69 percent of the survey sample) are 
small firms with incorporation capital of up to R10 million, and 
23 percent have incorporation capital of under R2 million. 
  The main clients of insurance companies among corporate 
entities are industrial (49 percent), agricultural (23 percent), 
and trading and intermediary and construction (9 percent) 
organizations and enterprises. 
  Priorities have emerged on the insurance market in forms of 
insurance between state and nonstate companies. State firms 
mostly carry out operations to provide long-term life insurance 
(75 percent), insure citizens' property (85 percent), and 
provide mandatory medical insurance (83 percent), while nonstate 
companies carry out operations to provide life insurance for 
terms of under a year (87 percent), voluntary medical insurance 
(96 percent), and liability insurance (90 percent). 
<H5>  Prices </H5>
  Prices of consumer goods and paid services in 1993 increased 
9.4 times over December 1992, including 9.0 times for foodstuffs 
(including alcoholic beverages), 7.4 times for nonfood goods, 
and 24.1 times for paid services to the population. Prices in 
city markets increased 9 times, including 8.5 times for 
plant-growing products and 10 times for livestock products. 
  The dynamics of inflation processes over 1993 were as 
follows. In the first half of 1993 the composite consumer prices 
index dropped from 126 percent in January to 118 percent in May. 
However, the inflation rate again began to pick up at the start 
of the second six months. In July the rate of increase in 
consumer prices was 122 percent, and in August 126 percent. In 
the fall the rate of price increases slowed and was 123 percent 
in September, 120 percent in October, 116 percent in November, 
and 113 percent in December. 
  In 1993 the rates of increase in consumer prices and prices 
for producer enterprises were similar. The prices of producers 
of industrial output increased 10 times compared with December 
1992, and prices of agricultural output increased on average 8.5 
times over the period. Prices for capital investments increased 
11.6 times, including 11.9 times for construction and 
installation work. 
<H5>  Finances </H5>
  Implementation of the Russian Federation consolidated budget 
for 1993 is expected to be R53 trillion for income and R64 
trillion for expenditure. The budget deficit will remain around 
R11 trillion (7 percent of GDP) and will increase more than 18 
times over 1992, despite only a 10-fold growth rate in inflation. 
  In 1993, unlike 1992, the greatest proportion of the income 
of the consolidated budget is made up of profits tax -- 35 
percent (29 percent in 1992). The increase in revenue from this 
tax is largely due to the general growth in nominal profits. 
  The decrease in the proportion of consolidated budget income 
yielded by revenue from value-added tax (from 38 percent to 25 
percent) in 1993 is due to the reduction in the rate of 
value-added tax from 28 percent to 20 percent and to 10 percent 
for food goods as of 1 January 1993. 
  The proportion of the consolidated budget income yielded by 
income from foreign economic activity and duties in 1993 
remained at the same level as the previous year -- 9 and 4 
percent respectively. 
  The main spheres of financing in 1993, as in 1992, were the 
national economy -- 30 percent of total spending, not counting 
loans and resources transferred in mutual settlements (35 
percent in 1992) -- and sociocultural measures: 27 percent (24 
percent in 1992). 
  The proportion of expenditure on maintaining organs of state 
power, management, and law enforcement and also on defense 
remained practically unchanged at around 7 and 13 percent 
respectively. 
  Federal budget income for 1993 (estimated) totaled R29.4 
trillion. The federal budget deficit, under the influence of 
indexation of the main expenditure headings and the 
implementation of new, unplanned expenditure, reached over R12 
trillion (7 percent of GDP). 
  Federal budget income accounts for 50 percent of the total 
income of the Russian Federation's consolidated budget; within 
this figure, profits tax for 1993 accounts for around 34 percent 
of the relevant heading in the consolidated budget, value-added 
tax accounts for 65 percent, income from foreign economic 
activity accounts for over 96 percent, and duties account for 53 
percent. 
  Federal budget expenditure accounts for over 51 percent of 
total consolidated budget expenditure (not counting resources 
transferred under mutual settlements, budget loans, and 
subventions). Federal budget expenditure on the national 
economy in 1993 accounts for over 28 percent of the relevant 
heading of expenditure in the consolidated budget, and 
sociocultural measures account for 19 percent. 
  Credit investments in the national economy totaled R30.5 
trillion as of the start of 1994 and increased six times over 
the start of 1993; as a percentage of GDP they totaled 19 
percent as of the start of 1994 as against 28 percent as of the 
start of 1993. 
  In view of the continuing inflation lending is short-term. 
In 1993 there was a decrease in the proportion of long-term 
credits granted for periods of over a year. They decreased from 
5 percent of the total credit investment in the first quarter to 
3 percent by the end of the year. The average term of a loan is 
two or three months. In March 1993 loans for terms of up to two 
months accounted for 66 percent of the total amount of credit 
placed on the stock market, in June they accounted for 98 
percent, and in September they accounted for 99 percent. 
  With a view to weakening the inflationary influence of 
central credits on the economy the state took measures to limit 
the growth in the money supply and credit. Preferential credits 
(the difference between interest rates and the Bank of Russia 
rate was formerly covered from the budget) were abolished from 
October 1993. The granting of technical credits to the CIS 
countries was ended (they were redesignated as interstate 
credits and included in the state debt). The Bank of Russia 
discount rate (refinancing rate) was revised. In 1993 it rose 
six times and since 15 October has remained at the level of 210 
percent. 
  The Russian Federation Savings Bank has over 70 percent of 
the population's accounts. According to operational data as of 
1 January 1994, 212.2 million investors had deposits there 
totaling R3,055.9 billion. The average deposit was R14,400 
(R3,200 as of 1 January 1993). 
  In 1993 commercial banks, seeking spare resources, actively 
attracted resources from private investors and shareholders. 
The balances in the population's accounts in these banks 
increased on average by 31 percent per month; the corresponding 
figure for the Savings Bank was 14 percent. A considerable 
contribution to this was made by the higher interest rate on 
investments and deposits in most commercial banks compared with 
the Russian Savings Bank. 
  Interest rates on investments and deposits in the Russian 
Federation Savings Bank in 1993 rose in April and October for 
current accounts from 20 percent to 40 percent, for fixed-term 
deposits from 60 percent to 120 percent, for special-purpose 
deposits for children from 80 percent to 190 percent, and for 
deposits according to term and amount from 80-90 percent to 
120-150 percent. New types of deposits for sums between 
R500,000 and R1 million and terms of six months or a year were 
introduced, and as of the end of 1993 the interest rates on them 
were 120 percent and 160 percent; for some of over R1 million 
and R5 million the rates were 170 percent and 180 percent 
respectively for a one-year term. 
<H5>  Population's Living Standard and Incomes </H5>
  The population's money incomes, boosted by the incomes of 
people engaged in entrepreneurial activity, totaled R78.3 
trillion in 1993, an 11-fold increase over 1992. Here 73 
percent of the growth in incomes came from increased earnings, 
16 percent was attributable to social payments, and other income 
accounted for 11 percent. 
  Money incomes taking account of the consumer price index 
increased 9 percent, while disposable money incomes increased 10 
percent. 
  In family income patterns revenue from state and cooperative 
organizations fell from 78 to 74 percent, social payments rose 
from 13 to 15 percent, and other income (from the sale of 
produce, livestock, and buildings and craft work) rose from 9 to 
11 percent. 
  For the bulk of the population wages are the main source of 
money income. In December 1993 the average wage in Russian 
economic sectors totaled R141,200, an increase of 39 percent 
over November. 
  Average monthly wages in December totaled R145,700 in 
industry, R194,900 in construction, R88,700 in agriculture, 
R112,500 in health care, physical culture, and social welfare, 
R98,300 in education, R84,900 in culture and art, and R95,300 in 
science and scientific services. 
  In December 1993 approximately half of all working people 
had 
wages below the Russian average. Around 2 percent of working 
people had wages lower than the minimum wage (R14,620). At the 
end of the year the average wage of the highest-paid 10 percent 
of working people was 27 times that of the lowest-paid 10 
percent. 
  The size of pension payments was revised quarterly 
throughout 
1993. The minimum old-age pension increased from R2,250 in 
January to R26,320 in December 1993 (taking compensation 
payments into account). It is estimated that as of 1 January 
1994 the average size of a designated monthly pension totaled 
R39,400, including the old-age pension of R41,400. 
  The stratification of society into rich and poor is 
proceeding rapidly. Currently the incomes of the most affluent 
10 percent are 11 times greater than the incomes of the least 
affluent 10 percent, whereas the correlation was 7.5-8 times at 
the end of 1992 and 4.5 times in 1991. By the end of 1993, 33 
million people (22 percent of the total population) had average 
per capita monthly incomes lower than the subsistence minimum. 
(The subsistence minimum is calculated on the basis of a Russian 
Federation Ministry of Labor methodology taking account of the 
sex and age mix of the population. Under this methodology the 
subsistence minimum includes: expenditure on food products 
calculated on the basis of the minimum consumption levels 
defined by the Nutrition Institute of the Russian Academy of 
Medical Sciences, the Institute of Socioeconomic Problems of the 
Population of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Russian 
Ministry of Labor; expenditure on nonfood products and services; 
and also taxes and compulsory payments, based on the expenditure 
patterns of the least affluent 10 percent of families). In 
December it totaled R42,800 per capita, including R48,400 for 
the work-capable population, R30,200 for pensioners, and R42,800 
for children. 
  Differentiation among the population in terms of property is 
less substantial than for incomes. According to figures from a 
Russia-wide survey of households, families with incomes below 
the subsistence minimum have 8 percent fewer refrigerators, 11 
percent fewer washing machines, 26 percent fewer color 
television sets, 20 percent fewer sewing machines, and 25 
percent fewer tape players and wall units than other families. 
  In 1993 the population of Russia spent a total of R53.8 
trillion on purchasing goods and services -- up 10.4 times in 
comparison with 1992 -- and R6.3 trillion on taxes and 
contributions -- up 10.2 times; while the growth of savings on 
deposit and in securities and of spending on the purchase of 
foreign currency totaled R10.9 trillion -- up 32.2 times. 
  The population's income exceeded its expenditure by R7.3 
trillion. At the end of 1993 residual money in hand (adjusted 
for cash held by commercial organizations) exceeded R8.4 
trillion. 
  Some 46 percent of the population's consumer spending went 
on 
food (47 percent in 1992), 44 percent went on nonfood products 
(41 percent in 1992), and 7.5 percent went on services (7.7 
percent). 
  In 1993 there was a change of trend in the dynamics of the 
population's consumption of basic food products. Whereas 1992 
had seen a decline in per capita consumption of meat, dairy, and 
fish products and fruit and vegetable produce, 1993 saw 
something of a return to the previous consumption level. 
<H5>  The Population's Employment </H5>
  In 1993 71 million people, or 48 percent of the total 
population, were employed in Russia's economy. The nonstate 
sector, in which more than 40 percent of working people are now 
employed, is starting to play an increasingly large role. 
  The numbers of working people in the main sectors of the 
social complex -- public education and health care -- increased 
in 1993 compared with 1992. The numbers of people working in 
credit provision and state insurance, in tax inspectorates, in 
notarial offices and legal services are growing steadily -- 
which attests to the start of the formation of an infrastructure 
characteristic of a market economy. At the same time there has 
been a drop in the numbers employed in science and scientific 
services and in planning and planning-surveying organizations. 
  By the end of 1993 the total number of persons out of work 
and actively seeking it, as well as persons working part-time 
(potentially unemployed), stood at 7.8 million, or 10.4 percent 
of the economically active population. Of these, 3.8 million 
people (5.1 percent) are classified as unemployed in accordance 
with ILO methodology. Some 0.8 million people, or 1.1 percent 
of the economically active population, have official unemployed 
status. 
  The average coefficient in Russia for the number of 
unemployed persons seeking work per vacancy in employment 
services stands at 3.1. 
  The labor market situation merits special attention in the 
republics of Mari El, Dagestan, Chuvashia, Adygea, and Mordovia 
and in Pskov, Yaroslavl, and Ivanovo Oblasts, where, given the 
high level of unemployment, the opportunities for finding work 
for the unemployed population are limited. In these regions 
between 16 and 33 people chase every job on offer at at the 
employment office, and 54 people in the Republic of Mari El. 
  Territorial and professional-qualificational disproportions 
in the supply and demand for manpower on the labor market are 
manifested in growing unemployment in a stagnant form. There 
has been an increase in the proportion of people who have been 
unemployed for more than four months; by the end of the first 
quarter of 1993 they made up 42 percent of the total number of 
unemployed, and now they make up approximately 56 percent. The 
proportion of citizens for whom work has been found within the 
total number of those seeking work is practically unchanged (6-8 
percent each month). 
  The problem of unemployment is most acute for women 
(approximately 70 percent of the officially registered 
unemployed). 
  As of 1 October 1993, 1.1 million people (3.3 percent of 
working people) were working an incomplete work week in 
industry, construction, transport, communications, domestic 
services for the population, science, and scientific services in 
1993. During the period since the beginning of the year 3.7 
million people took unpaid or partly paid vacations on the 
management's initiative. 
  The largest scale of partial unemployment was observed in 
enterprises of the textile industry, tractor and agricultural 
and diesel machine building, and the electrical engineering 
industry, where between 40 and 60 percent of employees took 
additional vacations or were transferred to an incomplete work 
week. 
  In 1993 strikes lasting one day or more were recorded at 265 
enterprises, establishments, and organizations in Russia -- four 
times fewer than in 1992. A premeditated cessation of work was 
noted primarily in enterprises and organizations of the fuel 
industry, transport, communications, and construction. In 1993 
there was a shortfall of output worth almost R8 billion in 
connection with strikes. The largest number of strikes was 
noted in March, in August-September, and during the last two 
months of the year. 
  The main reasons for mass absenteeism and work stoppages 
owing to strikes were delays over paying wages, demands for a 
wage increase, and failure to fulfill tariff agreements. There 
were strikes for these reasons in 21 regions of the country. 
<H5>  The Housing Problem </H5>
  Approximately 10 million Russian families (19 percent of the 
total number, of whom 1.3 million families -- 13 percent -- have 
been waiting for housing for 10 years or more) are currently 
standing in line to obtain housing in Russia. 
  Some 4.5 million people (3.0 percent) are living in communal 
apartments, and 6.5 million people (4.4 percent) in hostels. 
More than 20 percent of the housing stock is not provided with 
a water supply, a sewer system, centralized heating, or gas. 
<H5>  Education </H5>
  In 1993 daytime general educational schools in the state 
network were attended by 20.6 million pupils, which corresponds 
to 100.4 percent in relation to 1992, while preschool 
establishments were attended by 6.6 million children (91 
percent). Higher and secondary specialized educational 
institutions were attended by 2.5 million and 2.0 million 
students respectively, and in 1993 they trained 444,000 and 
547,000 specialists. 
  In the 1993-1994 academic year 95,000 students are studying 
on conditions of full reimbursement of costs (49,000 in the 
1992-1993 academic year). 
  The problem of finding work for graduates of schools, 
vocational and technical schools, technical colleges, and VUZ's 
[higher educational institutions] has been exacerbated. In 
1993, owing to a lack of applications and to employers' 
rejections of graduates for whom applications had been made 
earlier, 55,000 VUZ graduates (20 percent) and 124,600 graduates 
of secondary specialized educational institutions (33 percent) 
did not receive a posting to a job. 
  Alternative education was developing in many regions of the 
Russian Federation in 1993. At the start of the current 
academic year more than 300 lycees (over 200,000 pupils) and 
approximately 600 grammar schools (over 400,000 pupils) were 
functioning. There were 368 nonstate general educational 
schools (0.5 percent of the total number of schools), attended 
by 33,000 pupils (0.2 percent). 
<H5>  Demographic Situation </H5>
  During 1993 the country's population fell by 300,000, or by 
0.2 percent, and stood at 148.4 million by the beginning of 
1994. This was a consequence of unfavorable processes with 
regard to the birth and death rates, determined not only by the 
contemporary situation but also by the nature of demographic 
development in the past. Some 1.4 million babies were born in 
1993 -- 226,000 or 14 percent fewer than in 1992. The birth 
rate indicator per 1,000 of the population fell correspondingly 
from 10.7 to 9.2. 
  The number of deaths during the year increased by 360,000, 
or 
20 percent, and stood at 2.2 million, while the overall death 
rate indicator per 1,000 inhabitants increased to 14.6 from 
12.2; at the same time 348,000 people died from traumas and 
poisonings -- 40 percent more than in 1992. 
  The death rate for the population of able-bodied age grew at 
a preferential rate and increased by one-third over the year, 
while the proportion of persons of this age in the total number 
of those who died increased to 30 percent from 27 percent in 
1992. 
  Unfavorable changes in the birth and death rates led to an 
increase in the population's natural diminution: 800,000 or 60 
percent more deaths were registered than births (in 1992 there 
had been 220,000 or 14 percent more). 
<H5>  Ecological Situation </H5>
  In 1993 there was a certain reduction in the discharge of 
pollutants into the atmosphere and water expanses, connected 
mainly with the decline in industrial production. 
  An extremely high level of pollution of water expanses (100 
and more times in excess of maximum permissible norms) was 
observed in Sverdlovsk, Perm, Chelyabinsk, Murmansk, Orenburg, 
Kemerovo, and Kaliningrad oblasts. The greatest pollution in 
terms of the number of incidents and the quantity of components 
was recorded in the Volga basin with the Oka and Kama 
tributaries and in the Ob basin with the Irtysh and Tobol 
tributaries. 
  Discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere declined, 
according to estimates, by over 10 percent compared with 1992. 
Instances of extremely high pollution of the atmosphere were 
not recorded. But every month pollutants were noted in the 
atmosphere of 10-20 cities in concentrations 10 and more times 
in excess of the norm. This occurred most frequently in Moscow, 
Omsk, Dzerzhinsk, Novorossiysk, Ufa, Kemerovo, Samara, Norilsk, 
and Komsomolsk-na-Amure. 
<H5>  Crime </H5>
  In 1993 there were 2.8 million crimes recorded (101.4 
percent 
of the 1992 level) including 29,200 premeditated murders (127 
percent), 66,900 (124 percent) cases of premeditated grievous 
bodily harm, 184,000 thefts, (112 percent), 40,200 robberies 
(132 percent), and 14,400 (106 percent) cases of aggravated rape. 
  As before the most widespread forms of crime were thefts of 
state and public property (516,000, a reduction of 7 percent) 
and of citizens' personal property (1.064 million, a reduction 
of 3 percent). The proportion of these types of crime in the 
overall figure of recorded crimes rose from 50 percent in 1990 
to 56 percent in 1993. 
  There is an increase in the scale of the illegal circulation 
of arms. The number of thefts of weapons and ammunition in 1993 
compared with 1992 increased 23 percent, with 1,396 cases. Some 
22,100 crimes were committed with the use of firearms, 
ammunition, and explosives. 
  Over the year 53,200 crimes connected with narcotics and 
substances with powerful effects (an 80-percent increase 
compared with 1992) including 912 large-scale crimes (a twofold 
increase). About 20 tonnes of narcotics and substances with 
powerful effects were confiscated from criminals, as were 118 
tonnes of plants with a narcotics content. 
  In the economic sphere 110,000 crimes were detected. Almost 
one third (37,300) consisted of thefts through misappropriation, 
embezzlement, and the abuse of official positions. The number 
of detected cases of bribery rose 35 percent. 
  Over 1993 the law enforcement organs uncovered 1.3 million 
people who had committed crimes (10 percent more than in 1992). 
Every third criminal had committed a crime in a group and every 
other criminal had committed a crime while drunk. 
  The spread of crime in Russia was 1,883 crimes per 100,000 
members of the population (in 1992 the figure was 1,857 crimes). 
The crime detection rate increased from 47 percent in 1992 to 51 
percent in 1993.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Dyomina: "Tax Police Have Their Work Cut </F>
Out for Them: Russia's Tax Service Sums Up the Results of 1993"] 
  [Text] According to data furnished by the Department of Tax 
Police, the majority of tax violations were committed by 
limited-liability companies (25 percent) followed by private 
enterprises (11 percent) and joint ventures (5 percent). 
Overall, among tax-dodging enterprises, there are ten times as 
many commercial organizations as state enterprises. 
  Head of the Russian Federation State Tax Service Vladimir 
Gusev said at a press conference on Feburay 21, serious 
violations of the current state tax legislation consist of: 
concealment or understatement of expenditures, falsification of 
accounting records, an erroneous application of tax rates and 
tax privileges, depositing hard-currency earnings into accounts 
in foreign banks in violation of the relevant laws. 
  One of the causes of such violations is that the system of 
taxation is much complicated. There are too many local taxes 
(over 20, and practice has shown that their effectiveness is 
very low). Moreover, the payment of taxes is often late, in part 
for the lack of relevant information. 
  Foreign economic activity is the sphere plagued with the 
most 
criminal activity. It is in the lead as regards hard-currency 
budgetary indebtedness. Over 1,000 legal entities have been 
identified which have failed to register with the tax 
inspectorates. Commercial banks which open several accounts for 
a single enterprise simultaneously are also among violators of 
tax laws. 
  In 1993, taxes as a share of the gross domestic (national) 
product stood at 23.4 percent, and tax debts at 25.2 percent. As 
compared to 1992, those figures have fallen by 2.7 and 1.3 
percent, respectively, as a result of the fall in the VAT rates, 
a slowdown in profit growth and an increas in the number of tax 
privileges and incentives. One result of the recent tax amnesty 
has been the chanelling into the budget of over 330 billion 
rubles from 44,000 legal entities and 3,000 individual persons. 
  The combined enterprise debt owed to the state in unpaid 
taxes comprised 8 percent of the total sum of taxes earlier this 
year. The number of the debtor regions, for VAT, has reached 38 
and for the corporate profit tax -- 14. 
  Head of the Tax Police Department Sergei Almazov reported 
that in 1993 on the results of tax audits, debtors were 
obligated to pay 600 billion rubles, 120 million dollars and 2 
million DM. A total of 617 law suits were filed against 
offenders but only a handful of persons were brought to justice. 
He explains the great difference in figures by lack of adequate 
legislation and trained personnel. 
  The tax bodies are often accused of prejudice and 
corruption, 
says Vladimir Gusev. But of the 17 suits examined in court only 
one was settled in favor of a taxpayer. During the past year 
only 33 tax-service officials were sued, the total tax personnel 
being close to 132 thousand. Simultaneously, 100-odd attacks on 
tax officers were registered.

<F P=106> [Appeal to the President and Government of the Russian </F>
Federation and draft of a cooperation agreement transmitted by 
Yuriy Skokov, Chairman of the Federation of the Commodity 
Producers of Russia: "What Will be Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
Answer?; the Commodity Producers Have Proposed the Signing of a 
Cooperation Agreement to the Government"] 
  [Text] As has become known from well-informed sources, a 
few days ago the Chairman of the Federation of the Commodity 
Producers of Russia [FTR], Yuriy Skokov, transmitted to the 
president and government of the Russian Federation an appeal 
from the Council of the FTR and the draft of an agreement on the 
cooperation of the government and the FTR. 
  Considering the serious and urgent nature of these 
documents, 
as well as certain special features of the present situation in 
Russia, we are citing them in full. 
  Yu. Skokov had previously already carried on negotiations 
with the prime minister and the closest assistants of the 
president with respect to questions of guaranteeing the 
interests of domestic commodity producers. These discussions 
were held in a constructive spirit. 
  It is not difficult to observe that certain provisions of 
the 
appeal of the FTR Council to the government were utilized in 
Boris Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly. 
<H3>  Appeal of the Council of the Federation of the Commodity 
Producers of Russia to the Government of the Russian Federation </H3>
  The Second Congress of the commodity producers of Russia, 
which took place in December 1993, defined the basic problems of 
domestic commodity production and formulated the immediate and 
strategic goals of the association of commodity producers. 
  The position of the commodity producers with respect to 
questions of their cooperation with organs of state power is 
stated and demands regarding the creation of conditions ensuring 
such cooperation expressed in the Declaration of the Rights of 
Commodity Producers adopted at the congress. The indicated 
declaration was sent to the Government of the Russian Federation. 
  On the instructions of the Congress the Council of the 
Federation of Commodity Producers considers it necessary to 
direct the attention of the government to the fact that the 
growth of negative processes in the sphere of commodity 
production which is going on at the present time threatens to 
cause a chain reaction of dramatic social, political and 
economic consequences. 
  Tension in the economy has reached a critical point. Forced 
large-scale open and hidden unemployment can become the powerful 
detonator of a social explosion, since the state is not in a 
position to guarantee the protection of the basic social rights 
of the unemployed and there is no law regulating the relations 
of the unemployed with the state and fixing the duties and 
obligations of the state in relation to a person who has to all 
intents and purposes become a hostage of irresponsible 
experiments and political games. 
  It is necessary, finally, to honestly say that the basic 
cause of the developing inflation is the catastrophic drop in 
commodity production. The methods of struggling with inflation 
being practiced can only lead to the complete collapse of the 
economy. The means of regulating the economy being proposed are 
inadequate for the state of the national economy and have led to 
the fracturing of the resources and commodities markets and 
those of financial and industrial capital, and to investment and 
payments crises. As a result complete collapse threatens the 
economy and disintegration and chaos the state. 
  The Council of the Federation of Commodity Producers: 
  --proposes that the Government of the Russian Federation 
conclude an agreement defining the procedure for the 
implementation of the Declaration of the Rights of Commodity 
Producers and the cooperation of the parties in developing a 
coordinated position in the tactics and strategy of the further 
reformation of the economy; 
  --considers immediate consultations of the chairman of the 
Government of the Russian Federation with the chairman of the 
Federation of the Commodity Producers of Russia for the purpose 
of discussing and adopting an agreement and a joint plan of 
actions to be necessary; 
  --insists on the promulgation by the government of a precise 
plan of actions for stabilizing the economy and preventing the 
destruction of technological and intellectual potentials; 
  --considers it advisable for the agreement to be discussed 
in 
labor collectives and implemented in cooperation with the heads 
of administrations, regional unions of commodity producers and 
interregional associations for the economic cooperation of the 
subjects of the Federation. 
  If the government does not see the need for a joint search 
for ways to get out of the crisis and for securing a 
qualitatively new system of interrelations with commodity 
producers, then the Federation Council thinks that the 
government has a right to reach such a decision. However, it 
should be kept in mind that the economic reforms begun in the 
name of democracy and a better life for the citizens of Russia 
should not become the next tragedy in the country's history, 
which imposes a special responsibility in relation to the people 
and to history on all who have taken the levers of power into 
their hands. 
  The draft of an agreement of the Government of the Russian 
Federation with the Federation of Commodity Producers is 
attached. 
  On the instructions of the Council of the Federation of the 
Commodity Producers of Russia 
  Chairman of the Federation of the Commodity Producers 
of Russia Yu. Skokov 
<H3>  Draft Agreement on the Cooperation of the Government of the 
Russian Federation and the Federation of the Public Associations 
of the Commodity Producers of Russia </H3>
  Recognizing the need to combine the efforts of the 
Government 
of the Russian Federation and the Federation of the Public 
Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia for the 
purpose of: 
  --formulating a stable system of commodity production and a 
stage-by-stage large-scale restructuring of Russia's economy on 
new principles and creating a balanced national economy on this 
basis; 
  --retaining strategic and work-available resources, 
including 
the country's scientific-technical and technologicial potential; 
  --setting up a national self-developing market oriented to 
the domestic commodity producer and creating new forms for the 
self-organization of commodity producers on the regional and 
interregional levels; 
  --realistically achieving the social guarantees of all 
subjects of commodity production; 
  --creating an effective system for the cooperation of the

<F P=106> [Text of "Russian Federation Government Decree No. 96, </F>
Moscow, 10 February 1994, `On Delegation of Powers By the 
Russian Federation Government in the Management and Disposition 
of Federally-Owned Facilities'"] 
  [Text] For the purpose of improving administration of the 
state sector of the economy and in conformity with Article 114 
of the Russian Federation Constitution, the Russian Federation 
Government decrees: 
  1. That decisions on the establishment and elimination of 
state enterprises regarded as federal property (hereinafter 
called federal enterprises) are to be made by the Russian 
Federation Government on the basis of a joint representation by 
the State Committee on the Administration of State Property, the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Economics, and the federal organ 
of executive authority which has been charged with coordination 
and regulation of activity in the sector (sphere of 
administration) concerned in conformity with the laws in effect. 
  Decisions on the establishment and elimination of federal 
enterprises are subject to coordination with the organs of 
executive authority of Russian Federation subjects on whose 
territory the enterprises are located with respect to matters 
which require such coordination in conformity with laws of the 
Russian Federation. 
  2. That the Russian Federation State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property and the Russian Federal 
Property Fund, in accordance with the Russian Federation 
Government's decision, speak as founders on behalf of the state 
at enterprises established with the participation of other 
persons. 
  Representatives of the state at the enterprises cited are 
appointed by the Russian Federation Government or on its behalf 
by the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration 
of State Property and the Russian Federal Property Fund. 
  The competence of federal organs of executive authority to 
manage state property which is regarded as federally-owned when 
federal enterprises are changed into joint-stock companies and 
privatized is defined by Russian Federation laws on 
privatization. 
  3. In cases when establishment of a federal enterprise is 
financed with funds from the federal budget, the decision on its 
establishment is made by the Russian Federation Government on 
the basis of a joint representation by the Russian Federation 
State Committee on the Administration of State Property, the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Economics and Ministry of 
Finance, and the appropriate federal organ of executive 
authority. 
  Decisions on the transfer of funds from the federal budget 
to 
the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of 
State Property and the Russian Federal Property Fund for the 
payment of contributions to the charter capital of enterprises 
being established are made in the same procedure. 
  4. Decisions on the reorganization of federal enterprises 
which do not provide for a change in their form of ownership are 
made by the Russian Federation State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property in coordination with the 
federal organ of executive authority which has been charged with 
coordination and regulation of activity in the sector (sphere of 
administration) concerned, the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Economics, and (or) the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures. 
  5. The competence of the Russian Federation State Committee 
on the Administration of State Property is to include, together 
with the other powers granted to it by Russian Federation laws: 
  --implementation of juridical actions related to the 
establishment, reorganization, and elimination of federal 
enterprises, except for those whose right of implementation has 
been delegated by the Russian Federation Government to other 
federal organs of executive authority in conformity with this 
decree; 
  --the transfer of state property considered as 
federally-owned in the established procedure with full economic 
jurisdiction and operations management, as well as under a 
lease, for the use of juridical persons on the basis of 
contracts concluded with them; and 
  --control over the designated use and safety of state 
property considered to be federally-owned which is assigned to 
federal enterprises with the right of full economic jurisdiction 
and to federal state institutions with the right of operations 
management, as well as the property transferred to other persons 
in the established procedure. 
  The Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration 
of State Property has the right to assign implementation of its 
powers to other territorial agencies. 
  6. The federal organs of executive authority charged with 
coordination and regulation of activity in the sectors (spheres 
of administration) concerned are to be granted the right: 
  --to approve the charters of federal enterprises in 
conformity with the standard charter approved by the Russian 
Federation State Committee on the Administration of State 
Property; and 
  --to appoint and dismiss the managers of federal enteprises 
and to conclude, change, and cancel contracts with these 
managers in the procedure established by laws in effect. 
  The organs cited are the legal successors with respect to 
the 
contracts concluded previously with the managers of federal 
enterprises by the organs of state administration of the Russian 
Federation, the former USSR, and the RSFSR, as well as by 
concerns, associations, and other associations of enterprises 
during the period when they were granted the powers concerned. 
  The conclusion of contracts with newly appointed managers, 
as 
well as the renewal of contracts upon the expiration of the 
periods for which they were concluded, is to be based on the 
model contract adopted by the Russian Federation State Committee 
on the Administration of State Property. 
  7. A federal enterprise is to dispose of the property 
assigned to it exclusively in conformity with the specific 
assignment of property stipulated when it is transferred or the 
enterprise charter. 
  A federal enterprise does not have the right to sell the 
real 
property assigned to it, to use it as payment for the charter 
capital of other enterprises, to lease it, to transfer it as 
security or to make use of this property by other means without 
the consent of the Russian Federation State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property or its territorial agency. 
  In the event that this property is lost by a federal 
enterprise, it is not utilized in conformity with its specific 
purpose, or established rules for its use are violated, the 
Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of 
State Property has the right to confiscate the enterprise's 
property to which the restrictions stated in this paragraph 
apply or to reorganize the enterprise in the procedure 
established by Russian Federation laws. 
  8. In order to monitor the specific use and safety of state

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Popov, economist, Deputy of the State </F>
Duma from the Agrarian Party of Russia: "An Alliance of Bankers 
and Peasants Will Save Russia's Fields"] 
  [Text] An agrarian deputy rang up the editorial 
office. And he very politely inquired whether LITERATURNAYA 
GAZETA could make its pages available for constructive criticism 
of the point of view repeatedly expressed in the newspaper 
regarding the kolkhoz-sovkhoz system as a burden and an 
impediment to our movement toward a bright capitalist future. 
Inasmuch as the deputy turned out to be a professional 
economist, who took part, by the way, in developing banking 
legislation, the telephone conversation quickly turned into a 
friendly discussion, which, however surprising (for the subject 
of criticism were the appearances in LITERATURNAYA GAZETA of B. 
Fedorov's and my own articles), ended with an ascertainment of 
the coincidence of our views on quite a few points. On the 
following day, the deputy brought an article to the editorial 
office, which we are offering for your attention. 
  We are also prepared to give the floor to those who 
have different views, but on one condition: Do not restrict 
yourself to indiscriminate criticism, but propose constructive 
ideas, and seek a way out of our current economic impasse. 
  [Signed] Vladimir Prokhvatilov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA 
columnist 
  Agriculture in Russia is in a disastrous state. The slump in 
production is not ending for the second year, and the motor 
vehicle and tractor inventory is falling apart. But what is most 
regrettable is the fact that the agro-industrial complex simply 
is not entered into the logic of the liberal reforms that were 
conducted until recently. B. Fedorov, the former minister of 
finance, saw the Russian APK [agro-industrial complex] as a 
number-one inflationary danger, and he proposed purchasing 
foodstuffs abroad at cheaper prices. Boris Fedorov and Yegor 
Gaydar have resigned, but the attitude of the government toward 
agrarians has practically not changed. At a recent meeting of 
representatives of the agrarian faction of the State Duma with 
V. Chernomyrdin, our prime minister almost kissed a cross as a 
sign of his love for Russian kolkhoz workers, but he gave money 
for the spring sowing grudgingly. 
  But is a lot of money needed, and what for? Let us estimate. 
In Russia, 120,000 hectares of kolkhoz land are under grain. 
Approximately 60,000-70,000 hectares are sown annually, and 
about 100 million tonnes of grain are gathered from them. If the 
government needs this amount of grain, then it is necessary to 
allocate 8 trillion rubles [R] for the spring sowing. This will 
go for the payment of fuel, mineral fertilizers, and repair of 
equipment. If there is less money, there will also be less of a 
harvest. 
  It seems that the government decided to allocate R5 trillion 
for the needs of the APK in the form of credit at 213 percent 
annual interest and to pay off debts for products that were 
turned over last year. This is another R1.4 trillion. It is not 
difficult to calculate that this is not enough money to maintain 
the harvest at last year's level. The agrarians understand very 
well that an appeal to the budget is futile. There is no money 
in the treasury, but if you resort to monetary emission in order 
to cover inadequate resources with its help, then we will have a 
very severe inflationary outbreak that will destroy our economy. 
But if money is not given, the consequences could even be worse. 
There would be such a severe harvest shortage that it would 
simply be impossible to compensate for it with any kinds of 
purchases abroad. In addition, the inflationary expectations of 
the population on the threshold of an approaching famine would 
instantly draw long lines and would clean shelves of all 
foodstuffs. This would cause a sharp jump in prices.... 
  So this is what the unhappy alternative is. And I fully 
admit 
that many Russians will not be pleased by this choice between 
the Scylla and Charybdis, and that they would prefer to send all 
Russian kolkhoz workers to the moon and to buy wheat in America 
and Canada. Well, first, this would denote a full loss of 
national sovereignty. And, second, a year earlier the government 
of reformers tried to send the Russian VPK [military-industrial 
complex] "to the moon" by simply not continuing to finance it. 
As a result, the social resistance was of such a force that the 
government went back on its word and fully restored the state 
order for the defense industry. There is nothing good in such 
shying away. 
  And, third, the financial inadequacy of the Russian 
kolkhozes 
is not their fault at all. From the time of the notorious war of 
the city and the village in the 1920's, which ended with the 
robbery of the village, Russian peasants have been unable to 
stand on their feet firmly. It is as if peasant and subsequently 
kolkhoz property were inferior, an embryo of private property 
relations, as if it were considered a socialist virtue to take 
everything from the village, without returning anything. In a 
paradoxical way, the liberalization of prices in 1992 robbed the 
village in precisely the same way once more. The disparity of 
prices between rural and industrial commodities grew even more. 
By comparison with 1992, all prices "took off" by a thousand 
times and more, but rural products increased in price by a 
factor of only 100-120. While earlier one tonne of grain was 
equal in cost to 1.5 tonnes of fuel, then now this ratio is 
already 1:0.65. The same thing happened not only with grain, but 
also with other agricultural products. 
  And those who are dissatisfied with the increasing prices 
for 
bread and milk should know that the peasant receives only 
one-third of this price. For comparison: In the price of beer, 
80 percent is "added" by the producer. 
  Well, and where is the poor peasant to turn, you ask. Is 
there a constructive solution to the present impasse? Of 
course there is. It is off-budget financing. While there is no 
money in the treasury, there is money in the commercial banks. 
Economists of the Agrarian Party of Russia conducted 
consultations with a number of commercial banks and established 
that they are prepared to finance the spring sowing from their 
own resources, given the presence of certain guarantees. 
According to our calculations, by involving commercial banks, it 
is possible to collect the money that is lacking and to save the 
1994 harvest. This, of course, will not reduce the budget 
deficit, but it will "stretch it out" in time, and remove the 
seasonal outbreaks of inflation. 
  And incidentally, the necessary guarantees can be given. At 
least, V. Gerashchenko, the chairman of the Central Bank, 
appearing in the State Duma, supported such an idea. 
  The off-budget financing of the agrarian sector by 
commercial 
banks, in our opinion, can be implemented in two ways. First, 
Russian banks give the necessary special credits to the Ministry 
of Agriculture under a small, for example, 3-percent margin, 
after receiving in exchange the guarantee (promissory note) of 
the Ministry of Finance. This is the way the lacking resources 
are "acquired," and moreover, rather quickly. But it is 
necessary to hurry--it is already time for Krasnodar Kray to 
start sowing, but there is no money. 
  Second, it is necessary to develop direct horizontal ties; 
that is, banks and kolkhozes should communicate between 
themselves directly. This kind of drawing together, which is 
still rather timid, has started. For the time being, our bankers 
are more interested in the sphere of livestock raising, 
especially in poultry farming, where there is an uninterrupted 
production cycle. Bank credits can be granted to kolkhozes under 
a promissory note of a regional administration, or 10-30 percent 
of the shares of stock of a joint-stock company (which 70 
percent of our kolkhozes have already become) as security. 
  The first method of financing will give a quick effect, and 
the second is calculated for the future. This, perhaps, is the 
only method today to save Russia's perishing agriculture and to 
conclude a peace that is favorable to everyone in the exhausting 
and senseless war between the city and the village. And the 
government of V. Chernomyrdin, which up until now has not 
declared itself in any way, can stimulate this constructive 
process by convening a "roundtable" of bankers and agrarians, 
while playing the role of organizer of the negotiations and a 
guarantor of agreements.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Technical Sciences Boris Minin, </F>
director of the Methodological Center of Systems of Quality 
Certification of Goods and Services, under the rubric "Quality 
Control": "Certification With No Tricks"] 
  [Text] The International Academy of Information 
Services has established the Methodological Center of Systems of 
Quality Certification of Goods and Services--the MTs SSK. 
<H5>  Proceeding From the Standard </H5>
  Certification is "the action of a third party which makes it 
possible to establish the conformity of qualitative 
characteristics, the quality of a given product or service, to 
requirements established by a particular document." In civilized 
countries networks of certification centers specializing in 
various types of goods and services are quite common. They 
provide clear-cut landmarks for the consumer in a crowded market 
for products. For an honest manufacturer this is the best 
opportunity for fair competition. Therefore, certification is a 
mechanism for regulating market relations in a competitive 
environment. On the contrary, in the absence of such mechanisms, 
the unbridled and completely uncontrollable, semibarbaric market 
cannot shape a civilized society in which the dignity of 
citizens is among the principal values. At present, we are at 
the very beginning of the path to this society. 
  Here is the essence of the procedure being introduced, for 
those who have not managed to familiarize themselves with the 
Law "On the Certification of Products and Services" (approved by 
Decree of the Supreme Soviet No. 5153-1 of 10 June 1993), the 
work that preceded it in the Russian Federation Committee on 
Standardization, Metrology, and Certification, the All-Russian 
Scientific Research Institute of Standardization, and other 
institutes and establishments. 
  The legislation envisions certification of two types: 
compulsory and voluntary. Compulsory certification takes into 
account indicators concerning citizens' health, citizens' 
property, and environmental protection. It goes without saying 
that this type of certification is more than just necessary for 
many goods and services! A state organ, the Russian Federation 
Committee on Standardization, Metrology, and Certification, has 
undertaken to manage the implementation of certification. 
  Any quality parameter may undergo so-called voluntary 
certification. This procedure is effected on the initiative of 
either the manufacturer or the consumer. Therefore, the 
voluntary nature applies rather to the selection of parameters, 
the form of certification, and so on. It may be foisted on many 
producers contrary to their wishes. 
  In the simplest case, any producer (for example, a regular 
barber shop) may, having taken the state standard, sectoral 
standard, technical specifications, or even a list of 
requirements from, say, the United States or Mongolia as a 
basis, ask to be issued a certificate of compliance by the 
quality of his services with requirements outlined in the above 
regulatory documents. Undoubtedly, the multiplicity of such 
evaluations will hardly accomplish anything for the consumer, 
and it will play into the hands of those who will simply be able 
to hustle quickly, allocating some hundreds of thousands of 
easy-come rubles for certification. After all, millions are now 
being wasted on absolutely uninformative advertisement. Any 
producer may, at minimum cost, receive a "certificate of 
compliance" with anything. The beautiful piece of paper will 
hang in every business. Therefore, the consumer will once again 
end up sadly ignorant of the genuine quality of the goods and 
services offered to him. 
  However, there is another possibility: establish a uniform 
base for comparisons for all, and issue certificates that 
indicate the level of quality--the degree to which the quality 
of the tested sample, merchandise, or service exceeds that of 
the selected base. Therefore, a "Quality Certificate" is the 
highest degree of certificate of compliance endowed with greater 
rights. 
  It was precisely this path, the path of creating the optimal 
system of quality certification, that we took in developing the 
system of quality certification. 
<H5>  Quality-Related Services </H5>
  Work devoted to evaluating the quality of services, i.e. an 
area that has until now been a "terra incognita" in a way, has 
now been completed. Following prolonged debate, a generalized 
nomenclature of quality parameters of services has been finally 
specified and adopted, which has provided the foundation for 
selecting a basis for comparison in the system of quality 
certification of services developed by us. 
  Unlike the nomenclature of quality parameters of goods, 
services have four strictly delineated groups: the quality of 
the service proper, the standard of service, consumer spending 
for access, and, as a rule, the indirect effect (or loss) 
entailed by the principal effect. 
  With a view to establishing regional centers (in oblasts, 
cities, republics...), a number of certification organs for 
popular services--insurance, apartment exchanges, tourism, 
repairs of radio and television equipment, and others--have to 
be registered with the Methodological Center of the Systems of 
Quality Certification of Goods and Services. Many such centers 
are already working with specific enterprises, and the latter 
will soon be able to receive the first quality certificates in 
our country. Detailed information about this will be provided in 
the mass media. Naturally, consumers will draw the appropriate 
conclusions from this.

<F P=106> [Survey of Vsevolod Vilchek's Sociological Service on </F>
Television Viewing; interview with director of the Service by 
Yuriy Bogomolov, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent] 
  [Text] Vsevolod Vilchek's Sociological Service made a 
count of the overall ratings of the channels and broadcasts for 
two weeks of this year and for the same period last year, in 
order to ascertain which viewing audience had been lost, and 
where. A separate study was devoted to the "time budgeting" of 
television viewers. 
<H5>  What Are They Watching? </H5>
  It was revealed that Ostankino had lost somewhat during the 
year, and the second channel had gained somewhat, but at the 
same time, the latter lagged behind the former in the order. 
Incidentally, this is only the most general idea of the ebbs and 
flows of television viewers on the channels. If it is 
individualized, we will see the following. 
  At Ostankino, apart from its information programs, almost 
all 
the programs suffered noticeable losses. Only half as many 
viewers are watching "Utro" [Morning] this year as did last 
year. The ratings for "Zvezdnyy Chas" [Starlight Hour] in 1993 
constituted 24 percent, and this year dropped to 15 percent. 
  "Muzoboz" went from 10 percent to 6 percent. 
  "Lotto-million" -- from 17 percent to 8.5 percent. 
  "S Utra Poranshe" -- from 19.5 percent to 10 percent. 
  "Marafon-15" -- from 12.5 percent to 4.5 percent. 
  Against this background of the drop in the ratings of almost 
all the daily broadcasts, the constancy with which TV viewers 
devote their attention to the broadcast "Poka Vse Doma" [While 
Everyone Is Home] is worth a great deal. It consistently holds 
at the 19-percent mark. 
  Most symptomatic for Ostankino, however, is the fact that 
showings of feature films have begun to lose their audience, 
even though, in the quantitative respect, the showing of films 
and serials this year noticeably intensified. This is a sign of 
the fact that a certain oversaturation of the air waves with 
cinematographic spectacles has taken place. In addition, one 
must not discount the very keen competition from NTV, whose film 
repertoire is of higher quality and variety than the film 
programs of other channels. 
  To all appearances, Ostankino is at a point in its 
development which cannot be called anything but a crisis. 
Moreover, it is not a question of the problem which two weeks 
ago turned into blackmail of the telecommunications engineers, 
nor of the crisis of financial non-payments, but of the crisis 
of the creative debt of the most prestigious television company 
today. 
<H5>  What Is To Be Cut? </H5>
  "At the same time, we looked for the `holes' in the daily 
broadcasting, when the television audience is minimal," the 
director of the service explained to Yuriy Bogomolov, 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent. 
  [Bogomolov] What do you consider as "holes?" 
  [Director] Ratings in the area of zero to five percent. In 
this case it is not a question of the level of interest in 
certain specific broadcasts, but of the gradation of the 
potential viewer. It looks like this. From 6 to 7 in the 
morning, the audience is at zero and a little above. From 7 to 
8, the audience potential grows to 10 percent. Then comes a 
sharp drop. Beginning at 9, pensioners tune in, which gives 13 
percent. From 11 to 2 in the afternoon it is a desert -- about 7 
percent. From 2 to 3 in the afternoon, there are a few more 
viewers -- about 9 percent. The audience begins to grow 
noticeably from 4 p.m. By 6, the potential audience reaches the 
35-percent mark. NTV, which begins its broadcasting, not with 
current affairs commentators, but with entertaining programs, 
makes good use of this surge of viewers. It catches the wave of 
viewer interest and holds it for the whole evening. At 8-9 in 
the evening, the audience is already a whole 80 percent. This 
level is maintained to 10, and then begins a steady descent. By 
11, we have 54 percent. Just before midnight the audience falls 
to 36 percent. From midnight to one in the morning -- 17 
percent. After one in the morning -- 12 percent. 
  [Bogomolov] What conclusions can be drawn from this? 
  [Director] Daily broadcasting can be cut from 20 hours to 15 
without any particular damage to the mass audience. It is clear 
which time slots will have to go. 
  [Bogomolov] Apart from the mass audience, however, 
television 
has relatively narrow categories of viewers whose interests the 
state cannot disregard. 
  [Director] It is not ruled out that private television 
companies, who can get a broadcasting license on a competitive 
basis, to broadcast in the airwave space freed, will take over 
the concern for individual, relatively narrow strata of the 
television viewers.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Akkuratova: "Glavlit Is Dead. Long Live </F>
Glavlit?"] 
  [Text] A directive of the President of the Russian 
Federation has endowed the directors of 38 ministries and 
departments with the right to decide what is considered a state 
secret. 
  Only recently, the reserves of Samotlor oil and the 
building of a road beyond the Urals, the absolute figures for 
oil extraction, not just as a whole for the country, but even by 
individual oil fields, information on epidemics and permissible 
doses of radioactive, laser and super-high-frequency 
irradiation... were considered state secrets. What newspaperman 
does not remember the all-powerful Ivan Ivanovich Simdyankin 
from Agitprop, who alone decided whether the country should be 
told that a paper machine, let us say, in Kondopoga or Solikamsk 
had reached its planned capacity? 
  Day after day, journalists had to wage an exhausting 
struggle 
with Glavlit [Main Administration To Preserve State Secrets in 
the Press, of the USSR Council of Ministers], trying to persuade 
and entreat the censors, trying to prove to them the nonsense of 
banning the publication of an apparently inoffensive fact. In 
response, however, they were shown a list of pieces of 
information which could in no way be reported. Things reached 
the point of absurdity. For example, you must not write about 
laying a highway to the electric power plant under construction 
in Siberia (beyond the Urals, yet!), but just designate the 
route of the access road and you can easily indicate where it 
comes from and where it goes -- the censor gave an "O.K." to the 
publication. 
  To give Glavlit credit -- it was not the one that thought up 
the list of bans, it merely took pains to adhere to it. The list 
of state secrets was worked out in the depths of the ministries 
and departments, and approved by the USSR Council of Ministers. 
Now there is no USSR Council of Ministers, Glavlit has ended up 
unwanted, and the newspapers were swamped with facts that had 
been kept top secret. But somehow no one heard about pernicious 
journalists divulging any sort of state secrets, doing damage to 
the country, during the years of this freedom. (Mirzoyanov's 
convolutions, I am sure, were only of benefit to the country -- 
well, after all, journalists had nothing at all to do with it!) 
  Just what is a state secret? The federal Law "On the State 
Secret" said that it is "...information protected by the state 
in the sphere of its military, foreign policy, economic, 
intelligence, counter-intelligence and operations-investigation 
activity, the dissemination of which might be detrimental to the 
safety of the Russian Federation." Judging by the President's 
directive, however, this concept is now given a broader 
interpretation: the safety of the state is identified with the 
safety of individual departments. Most of the ministers have 
been endowed with the right to qualify information as a state 
secret. The heads of the ministries of Justice, Labor, Social 
Security, Education and Culture and of the committees for 
Cooperation with CIS States and for Nationality and Regional 
Policy Affairs constituted an exception. It is completely 
understandable when the ministries of Defense, Internal Affairs, 
Economy, Federal Foreign Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence 
services and the MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] possess the 
right to make information secret. But what sort of state secrets 
do the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, the 
State Committee for Higher Education and the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources guard? Or will 
they again conceal from us data on harvests, catastrophes and 
natural disasters, ecology and demography? We will draw them 
from broadcasts of the BBC or Radio Freedom. In a word, it is a 
question of whether society can obtain reliable, objective 
information -- the right to the freedom to seek, obtain and 
transmit this information was declared by our Constitution. 
  It must be said that even before the president's directive 
it 
was quite difficult to obtain information at the ministries -- 
the press-services, created, one would think, to help the 
writing brethren, protected them reliably. These services, 
however, turned into an impenetrable wall, shutting the 
officials away from the journalists. The ministerial bureaucrats 
have now obtained a super-reliable means: consider some sort of 
data a state secret -- and they are tightly closed to the press. 
Again the officials will decide what we can know and what we 
cannot know. Does the departmental right to make information 
secret not contradict the presidential Edict, which speaks of 
indispensable informational openness concerning the actions of 
the authorities? It would seem that the list of state secrets 
should still pass a qualifying examination by expert scientists, 
lawyers and journalists. 
  One more thing. Who will see to it that journalists still do 
not publish facts with the stamp of "top secret"? Will Glavlit 
rise again?

<F P=106> [Interview with Yelena Yulikova, head of the administration </F>
of social service nonmobile institutions under the Russian 
Federation Ministry for Social Protection of the Population, by 
Yelena Vasilkova, under the "Continuing the Subject" rubric: 
"The Homeless Are People Too"] 
  [Text] Moscow--We recently published an article about 
the homeless that was sent by our correspondent from Perm and 
titled "Extraterrestrials." But this problem exists in more than 
just one city. Recently, "persons without definite employment 
and residence" can be seen practically at every railroad station 
of any city. 
  Why have they become so numerous? Is anyone involved 
with the destinies of these people, or has our society turned 
its back on them? 
  "Yes, this has become a real catastrophe for Russia," says 
Yelena Yulikova, head of the administration of social service 
nonmobile institutions under the Russian Federation Ministry for 
Social Protection of the Population. "People are moved or forced 
to become homeless for the most various reasons. Due to the 
production drop, some people have lost their jobs and, together 
with them, they have lost their beds in the dorms. Others have 
come here because of interethnic conflicts. Still others get 
`thrown out' into the streets by their relatives...." 
  [Vasilkova] Are all these people now doomed to wander from 
place to place and beg? Our people cannot find employment if 
they do not have permanent residence registration, can they? 
  [Yulikova] Yes, they can find it. True, it is hard and 
nonprestigious jobs, if they are healthy and, what is most 
important, willing to get out of this situation. But imagine, 
many of the homeless do not want any changes in their lives. 
  Not so long ago, we conducted a small sociological study at 
several Moscow railroad terminals, and we offered the following 
to the homeless: We would put the old people in boarding houses 
and find jobs for those who can work. Here is the result: Out of 
the 180 people we talked to, nobody wanted to have anything to 
do with the federal organs. Some of them even expressed their 
indignation: This, they said, is a violation of personal 
freedoms and an infringement on human rights, which cannot be 
allowed in our present democratic society. 
  Here is another example: A man was showing off his 
artificial 
limbs in the underground passage right next to our Ministry. 
Passersby were dropping money into his hat, and I came up to 
him, introduced myself, and invited him to come to our Ministry 
for help. Do you think he was happy? Quite the contrary! It 
turned out that he had a family, an apartment, and a pension. He 
was simply "moonlighting" in the passage there. There are so 
many such people now! 
  [Vasilkova] But there are other people also, feeble old men 
and women who, through some tricks or sometimes threats, have 
been forced to sell their apartments, and now they have to 
wander around without a place to live. 
  [Yulikova] But why does this happen? Nothing of the kind 
could have happened before, for the simple reason that there was 
a rule: If someone went to sign out, prior to his departure from 
a residence, he had to produce a document stating where he was 
going. We do not have such a rule any more. You can sell your 
apartment, sign out, and go wherever you wish. Is this normal? 
Scoundrels jumped at this opportunity right away--they found a 
loophole for fooling old people and taking away their legitimate 
residences. 
  [Vasilkova] What can the victims do in such cases? They are 
lucky if they have relatives who can give them shelter. But most 
often this happens to lonely people. 
  [Yulikova] We try to help such people if they come to us. 
  [Vasilkova] But many of them do not know about you, they do 
not know how to find you. As far as I know, in the old days the 
militia used to detain vagrants, but now, for some reason, the 
militiamen just pass them by with indifference. 
  [Yulikova] The problem is that, rather recently, we repealed 
Article 209 of the Criminal Code, which specified types of 
punishment for vagrancy. Apart from detaining transients, the 
militia used to send them to special reception and distribution 
centers, where their identities were established, necessary 
medical assistance given, and their future fate decided. It 
often happened that wanted criminals were hiding among the 
"tramps." 
  [Vasilkova] Yelena Pavlovna, for some reason you are using 
the past tense when you talk about all this. Have special 
reception and distribution centers been closed, due to our fight 
for human rights? 
  [Yulikova] Not yet. They are still run by the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs [MVD], but there are plans to replace them with 
rehabilitation centers. Now we are the only agency that has been 
entrusted with the problem of the homeless. 
  [Vasilkova] In other words, it is your service and not the 
militia that is going to round up the homeless at railroad 
terminals and on the streets and place them in those centers? 
  [Yulikova] We are not going to force anyone to go anywhere. 
Ours is a social institution which, I want to repeat, adheres to 
the principle of free will. 
  [Vasilkova] What kind of extremes we have in our country: We 
used to exile people to the 101st kilometer for not working; now 
you can idle all you want and nobody cares! But you yourself 
said that vagrancy has become a profession for some people; it 
is doubtful that any of them will come to you to "surrender" of 
their own free will. Which means that it is you and I now who 
are destined to look at hordes of ragged and dirty people 
filling our railroad stations and underground crossings. But 
what about the recent edict of our president "On Measures for 
the Prevention of Vagrancy and Begging"? What are those measures? 
  [Yulikova] The complexity of this document lies in the fact 
that it does not define the status of either a vagrant or a 
beggar. Incidentally, the same problem exists in many other 
countries. Even though some of them have laws restricting even 
begging to certain places only: You cannot stay at a 
transportation terminal if you do not have a ticket for a train 
or a bus. But you are right in saying that our railroad stations 
have become filthy night shelters. I agree that it is unpleasant 
and even dangerous to be there, next to dirty people who are 
often sick or covered with lice. There are quite a few hoodlums 
and thieves among the homeless, too. This is the reason that I 
think that it was a rash step to shift from the militia to us 
such an important, urgent, and crime-conducive problem. We ought 
to defend those who need it, but not the people who we need to 
be protected against. 
  [Vasilkova] Would it be better for you to deal with the 
problem in cooperation with the militia? 
  [Yulikova] We successfully cooperated with them before, 
also. 
The most reasonable decision would be for us to continue 
cooperation and reorganize the reception and distribution 
centers instead of closing them down. But to destroy all this 
with a single blow all of a sudden and to make us start it from 
the very beginning? 
  [Vasilkova] So what did you start with? 
  [Yulikova] So far, we have been operating by trial and 
error. 
Certain things we borrowed from our foreign colleagues, others 
we invented ourselves. We settled on three types of social 
assistance: the overnight shelter, the social hostel, and the 
adaptation center. We have made the designs for them and sent 
them to various regions. 
  Any person, even one with no documents, can go to an 
overnight shelter. There he is given, free of charge, a bed and 
bedding, and medical assistance. We are planning to have 
counseling services in those places in future. 
  A social hostel will provide shelter for a term from one day 
to a month. During this time, every person will be given a free 
meal ticket daily. An adaptation or rehabilitation center will 
accommodate people for six months; they will work there and 
receive treatment. They will have addiction treatment and legal 
services, and medical and labor centers. One such center has 
already been opened in Makhachkala. An overnight shelter and a 
social hostel have opened in Lipetsk. 
  [Vasilkova] And in Moscow? As far as I know, there is just 
one flophouse, an overnight shelter, excuse me, for the entire 
huge city. Do you think it sufficient? 
  [Yulikova] Who can think this! But if you only knew what it 
cost us to open even this one! It is not even a house: We just 
secured part of a boarding home for the elderly who had to 
settle for less space for this. The Moscow government could not 
find any accommodation for this charitable institution. They 
manage to find buildings for all kinds of firms and joint 
ventures, but here--alas! 
  [Vasilkova] Here are your market relations, Yelena Pavlovna! 
Firms pay big money. 
  [Yulikova] We, our society, will have to pay a lot more if 
we 
do not resolve the homeless problem in time. Believe me, this 
problem is very far from being a simple one, and we should not 
hush it up, unload it on someone else, or let it run its own 
course. We need to take urgent measures including some 
legislative ones. If we want to live in peace.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel of Militia Vladimir Rushaylo, head </F>
of the Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime, by 
Aleksandr Danilkin; place and date not given: "We Are a Bone in 
the Mafia's Throat"] 
  [Text] It was thought until recently that there was no 
organized crime in our country. Judging by court statistics, 
there was also no gangsterism. But when special subunits in the 
fight against organized crime were finally established, "an 
unexpected discovery" followed: being without them is like being 
without hands. And the most drastic type of modern crimes is 
their stock in trade: rackets, hostages, and gangster showdowns. 
War every day. Novices have assumed leading roles. 
  The Moscow Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime 
(RUOP) was established two years ago, and from its very first 
days it has been headed by Colonel of Militia Vladimir Rushaylo. 
  [Danilkin] Vladimir Borisovich, recently employees of your 
directorate had a housewarming, when you had to exchange the 
legendary address of 38 Petrovka for 6 Shabolovka... 
  [Rushaylo] Yes, we moved to a separate house, but it is not 
necessary to search for any secret reasons or undercurrents, or 
for distrust toward the rest of the militia service. It simply 
became too crowded for us at 38 Petrovka, inasmuch as the number 
of our employees had increased, and rather significantly. We 
were forced to take this step. Incidentally, thanks to the 
concern of the Government of Moscow and the mayor. 
  [Danilkin] If it is not a secret, by how much did the 
Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime employee staff 
increase? 
  [Rushaylo] During the last year--fourfold. Judging from the 
situation, this is not the maximum. Many call our subunit elite. 
I do not regard this as superiority over other services, but as 
the level of demands that are made on us. 
  [Danilkin] So, two years have gone by. In your opinion, has 
the new subunit justified the hopes that were associated with 
its creation? 
  [Rushaylo] It would be improper to give an evaluation of 
one's own work, but I think that it is possible to claim that we 
have succeeded in occupying a noticeable niche in the law 
enforcement area. Organized crime is a phenomenon that is purely 
social, intruding into all spheres and trying to get ahead of 
the law enforcement system, mastering increasingly newer types 
of crimes. Owing to this, certain dead zones are being 
organized, which our militia branch services were not succeeding 
in looking into, as narrow departmental barriers interfered. But 
we use simultaneously the principle of criminal search (from the 
criminal offense to the person) and the principle of the subunit 
in the fight against economic crime (from the person to the 
crime), with the latter dominating. We are able to take in those 
dead zones, which have begun to turn into volcanoes. 
  For example, a crime has been happening here recently which 
we previously only heard about, or knew very little about. For 
example, extortion: As recently as 1986 there were four cases in 
all of Moscow. But in the past year alone we have registered 333 
cases, and, consider this, this type of crime is one of those 
that are especially latent. Or kidnapping people to obtain a 
ransom, as we say, seizing hostages: two cases were registered 
in 1990, and last year here there were 77 citizens' appeals for 
a similar reason, and 62 criminal cases were instituted. 
Finally, in January of this year 30 citizens filed complaints 
with us regarding seizure of hostages. Our employees worked on 
each case, freeing the people. 
  [Danilkin] But how many criminal cases on seizure of 
hostages 
were instituted? For example, in January? 
  [Rushaylo] Unfortunately, only six. Inasmuch as the article 
of the Criminal Code "Seizure of Hostages"--the jurisdiction of 
the Procuracy--allows for ambiguity in the classification of the 
crime, which leads to casuistic legal games. We are trying to 
conduct a practical dialogue with the Procuracy, but for the 
present we are able to bring only a third of the cases to a 
juridical result. 
  [Danilkin] Organized crime is feeding on the particular 
weakness in the sphere of the economy... 
  [Rushaylo] In connection with the fact that the state sector 
has almost disappeared completely, numerous associations with 
limited responsibility have appeared, but, as we say, with 
unlimited opportunities. In this situation criminal groups, 
especially of an ethnic orientation, have set themselves up 
quite successfully. They are organizing associations that would 
seem to be engaged in commercial activity. But they are in fact 
laundering criminal money. Frequently, the very trade kiosks 
that congest the city are used as a cover for criminal activity. 
  [Danilkin] Are our mafiosi laundering money, taking the 
experience of their Western colleagues into account? 
  [Rushaylo] The traditional spheres of organized criminal 
activity in the West are the gambling business, prostitution, 
and drugs. In our country, organized crime has chosen other 
types of trade; for example, extortion is rather widespread. A 
so-called protection tax is imposed on businessmen. The 
criminals approach a commercial structure: "Do you have a 
`roof'? What are you standing under?"--this is nothing other 
than extortion, and it brings in colossal incomes. Some prefer 
not to make a fuss, and make the payoffs. Anyone who appealed to 
us received professional assistance.. 
  [Danilkin] It is said that almost all entrepreneurs are 
covered with this same "roof?" 
  [Rushaylo] It is impossible to give a precise figure. But it 
is impossible to say that absolutely everyone is paying tribute. 
More than a dozen people come to us every day with complaints. 
And many of them say that the extortionists had approached them 
for the first time. It is advantageous for the criminals to 
spread rumors that everyone is paying up. Then it is easier for 
them to tell people: "If everyone else is paying--why are you 
not paying up?" A psychological working-over goes on. 
  [Danilkin] Thus, it turns out that you have to work in 
various directions. But how in your opinion did Moscow organized 
crime spot your unit? How dangerous an opponent are you? 
  [Rushaylo] First of all, it is necessary to make a 
reservation--at the present time there is no single organized 
crime structure in Moscow. There are a number of organized crime 
groups: regional, ethnic, interregional, and transnational. 
Internecine wars rage continuously between them for spheres of 
influence. So, for these groups the regional directorates for 
fighting organized crime frequently become a bone in the throat. 
Our opponents' arsenal includes threats, intimidation, attempts 
to influence our relatives--we feel all of this personally, 
since we have occasion to affect someone's criminal interests 
all the time. 
  [Danilkin] And how do you react to such threats? 
  [Rushaylo] In an appropriate way. We guard our people, and 
we 
are in a position to protect them. However, credit must also be 
given to the opposing side; they have begun to approach "raids" 
on the Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime in a 
creative way. 
  [Danilkin] What do you mean? 
  [Rushaylo] I have in mind an organized campaign to discredit 
the subunits in the fight against organized crime. A whole 
series of articles have appeared in the press recently which, 
trying to "scoop" us, "expose" our employees and our operations. 
No, we are not suffering from megalomania and infallibility, we 
have ordinary people working for us who make mistakes and 
miscalculations. But from the articles I have in mind, the 
telltale signs were too strong. We later conducted our own small 
investigation and we have an idea how much these articles cost 
somebody. 
  [Danilkin] Are you not too categorical in your conclusions? 
  [Rushaylo] Not at all. In all the articles there is one 
thought on the surface: Regional Directorate for Fighting 
Organized Crime members fire at whatever comes to mind, they are 
creating tyranny, and guiltless citizens are suffering. 
  [Danilkin] But what is really the case? 
  [Rushaylo] For this it is necessary to return to reported 
cases. For example, the incident at the Koptevo bathhouses in 
November of last year. Here is the sense of the information 
released in the newspapers: Regional Directorate for Fighting 
Organized Crime employees opened fire for no reason on a 
suspicious group of men in a residential rayon, as a result of 
which one of them died under obscure circumstances, and two 
militia men were wounded. It is totally incomprehensible, on the 
other hand, it is a pity about the member of the Koptevo group 
who was a victim. But this is the way the official investigation 
interprets the events. An operational group was surveilling 
Zhiguli's, one of whose passengers had a weapon. The militia 
employees stopped the car at the Koptevo bathhouses and asked 
for documents. In response to this, a passenger in the Zhiguli 
snatched a screwdriver and struck an employee in the face. 
Almost simultaneously shots were fired in the direction of the 
militia employees from three cars standing nearby, and 
afterwards a dozen men armed with baseball bats, knives, and 
guns went after the militiamen. Only then did they employ their 
official weapons. As you see, there is a substantial difference 
in the description of the events. 
  [Danilkin] What other articles are you talking about? 
  [Rushaylo] The events of 25 January at the Izmailovo hotel 
complex are described in this same vein: operatives opened a 
barrage of fire on a Cherokee jeep because, as it seemed to 
them, people from an Izmailovo group were sitting in the 
vehicle. The jeep jumped into the oncoming lane and collided 
with an oncoming vehicle, whose passengers perished in the 
crash. There was not a word about the fact that before this, the 
jeep, coming out of a chase, rammed into a militia Zhiguli (one 
of the employees incurred concussion of the brain), that sitting 
in the jeep was the authority of an Izmailovo criminal group who 
was under federal investigation for robbery with use of 
firearms, that they fired at the wheels... 
  A militia operation in the private club White Cockroach was 
described in the same vein. 
  [Danilkin] Do you want to say that the Regional Directorate 
for Fighting Organized Crime has declared a psychological war? 
  [Rushaylo] We have always been in a state of war with crime. 
It is simply that new, legal forms of struggle against us have 
emerged. And we must be prepared for this. For discreditation of 
our employees, unfounded accusations, and fabricated 
compromising material. These methods are known throughout the 
world. 
  [Danilkin] How do you intend to react to such accusations? 
  [Rushaylo] I can firmly promise our opponents one thing: Any 
attempt by criminals to employ weapons against our employees 
will end with one and the same thing--we will shoot to defeat 
them. This is our tough, principled position. No kinds of rumors 
or planned accusations of alleged illegal actions will prevent 
our employees from acting within the scope of the law and the 
powers granted them. Incidentally, the series of newspaper 
articles apparently lack one more thing. The other day, during 
the arrest of a group of criminals, a Regional Directorate for 
Fighting Organized Crime employee shot one of them. It happened 
this way: When a bandit pulled out a TT [Tula Tokarev] pistol 
with a bullet in the cartridge chamber and pointed it at the 
operative, the militia employee proved to be faster on the draw. 
Now we are awaiting a new description of our "criminal errors." 
  [Danilkin] But you will agree that it was just a few years 
ago that every time the militia used a weapon was almost a 
sensation and a reason for endless justifications. 
  [Rushaylo] Yes, it happened. The press wrote for a whole 
week 
about a mentally ill person who fired a hunting rifle several 
times from a balcony, and the entire militia leadership came to 
the scene of the incident. Today shots can be heard on Moscow 
streets every day. How can this wave of violence be stopped? 
Only with harsh measures. But, I emphasize, within the scope of 
the law. In the last five years crime in Moscow has increased by 
a factor of three. Our service often frees four to five hostages 
in a day, we are fired upon, we confiscate mountains of weapons, 
drugs... 
  [Danilkin] Do you not get the impression that Regional 
Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime employees are now 
working in an "emergency first aid routine"--there are not 
enough hands despite regular increases in the size of the 
directorate? 
  [Rushaylo] There is such a danger. But we are counting on 
the 
people's understanding and the support of the leadership of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and the municipal authorities. This 
will greatly help us in suppressing the criminals' 
ever-increasing onslaught. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  In one day, just before this material was sent to press, 
employees of the Moscow Regional Directorate for Fighting 
Organized Crime arrested a group of hired killers from Saransk 
(four murders), a crime kingpin, and three authorities in the 
criminal world; prevented the theft of money in the sum of 2.4 
million French francs; solved six crimes; confiscated four 
firearms; and began work on seven complaints that came in that 
day.

<F P=106> [Article by Karen Brutents: "Why Did Yegor Gaydar Suddenly </F>
Start Talking About Corruption?: What Kept Him From Fighting It 
When He Was in the Government?"] 
  [Text] I am prompted to write about corruption again, not 
only by the subject itself, the topicality of which, 
unfortunately, simply continues to grow, but also by the fact 
that for the first time, at least publicly, Yegor Gaydar has 
addressed it extensively: "The boundlessness of corruption is 
profoundly insulting. The main reason for the collapse of 
democratic power, I am convinced, is related... to the profound 
disillusionment with the `democracy of thieves.'" 
  One can only rejoice that such a well-known and influential 
person has turned his attention to this problem, which is, as we 
liked to put it not long ago, so portentous for the country. One 
cannot help but agree that "corruption is becoming, not a 
by-product, but a determinant (at least, one of the 
determinants) of the political process." Incidentally, this was 
also mentioned on the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, although not 
in such complicated form. Taken as a whole, however, the 
arguments of the former first vice-premier impel us to make 
certain comments. 
  First of all, it is curious that Ye. Gaydar addresses this 
subject when he is already outside the government and feeling 
about for a popular platform for his fight to return to power. 
When he was at Staraya Ploshchad, he did not do this. I see in 
this, unnecessary confirmation of the fact that the fight 
against corruption is not -- leaving aside the question of "why" 
-- among the primary concerns of power. I recall that Nikolay 
Fedorov, the former minister of Justice (now president of 
Chuvashia), even spoke of a "lack of the will, among the higher 
Russian leaders, to fight in earnest against corruption." Not 
counting, of course, the myriad loud-mouthed decrees and edicts, 
the dissolved committees and commissions, etc. These spasmodic 
propagandistic imitations provide, rather, a negative effect, 
strengthening the corrupters' insolent belief in impunity. 
  The scandalous exposures of corruption in the higher 
government echelons, which surfaced in the course of the scuffle 
between the legislative and executive powers, have faded into 
oblivion. Having fulfilled its function, that of dethroning 
Rutskoy, the Interdepartmental Commission to Fight Crime and 
Corruption, created by a decision at the highest level, and 
appearing to us on the television screen even under the 
chairmanship of the president, has quietly passed to its rest. 
Likewise remaining unclear is the Russian-Swedish-Canadian 
odyssey of Yakubovskiy, reminiscent of a hurriedly cooked-up 
mediocre detective story, a sprinter's rise -- in the manner of 
the favorites of the medieval monarchs -- a young reserve 
officer coming close to a general's epaulets. None of the state 
and political figures from the official tribunal followed the 
example of Sergey Shakhray -- he did not publish the data on the 
property situation and incomes. The press and television also 
grew tired of -- or seemed uncomfortable with -- the theme of 
corruption. They prefer to lapse into general discussions, 
sometimes sluggishly stinging personalities of rayon or 
settlement scale. 
  Meanwhile, corruption has obtained a qualitatively new 
dimension. It has not only resolutely widened its boundaries, 
having covered practically the whole country with its hairy paw 
and ensnared all the degrees of the administrative ladder. A 
union of influential groups of bureaucrats, with the criminal 
and semi-criminal nouveau riche, has actually been organized on 
the its basis. This not only bleeds the country economically and 
prevents the growth of production enterprise, but has also 
become a weighty political factor (let us remember Ye. Gaydar's 
"determinant"). In many cases, this iniquitous union interferes 
in the electoral process, turns the practical realization of 
certain government decisions to its advantage and has a direct 
influence on other decisions. The Russia of reforms is turning 
into the Russia of corruption. This is already scaring off its 
Western partners. The Paris QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS wrote the other 
day that corruption in Russia was of a scope that created 
serious ethical problems for those in the West who were doing 
business with it. 
  Yegor Gaydar, obviously, underestimates the effect of the 
sluggish stand of authority on the corruption processes. I am 
not going to find fault with the natural striving to minimize 
the "exploits" in this field, to use his expression, of "new 
people," and to give first place to the "former" schedule of 
appointments: it is dictated by the transparent political biases 
and gains. In real life, things are going, of course, otherwise 
-- the division here is not in any way taking place on this 
basis. In the embezzlement of public funds, both these schedules 
of appointments merge very nicely, although not without 
conflicts. 
  When Yegor Timurovich writes that "the main thing is to 
destroy the objective bases of corruption and the state's 
monopolistic power over ownership," he is, of course, right. No 
less important, however -- particularly under the present 
Russian conditions -- is the way the state parts with its 
property. A unique process -- even the Chinese phenomenon bears 
only a distant resemblance -- is taking place in Russia right 
now, a process of alienation from the state and feverish 
dividing up of huge property worth hundreds of billions of 
dollars. It is being done actually behind the scenes, outside 
democratic control, farmed out to an army of officials, many 
units of which were corrupted from the start. The formal 
participation in this process of part of the population and work 
collectives is, of course, no hindrance to it. They have 
absolutely no understanding of either the essence or the 
technology of what is taking place, and are subject to pressure 
from the management of the enterprises, which makes wide use of 
the threat of unemployment as a warning to "parliament." This 
system of privatization is undoubtedly a fantastically powerful 
supplementary feeding factor for the corruption bacchanalia. 
  Finally, corruption in Russia, as everywhere, incidentally, 
does not boil down to merely embezzlement of public funds and 
bribery. Perhaps, though, it is in our country, against a 
background of the boundless "flood" of them and the loss of 
ideals that political, moral corruption has taken on 
immeasurable scope. It has dragged many state officials, 
parliamentarians and professionals of various colors into its 
rapids. I am not concerned with the privileges with which the 
state pays for the stress, fervor and loyalty of its officials, 
although, of course, I do not agree with Ye. Gaydar when he 
states that it is "not a struggle against privileges, and 
especially not unappetizing populist outcries on this subject" 
that we need to counter corruption. The temptation is great to 
recall that these "outcries" were the main hobby-horse of the 
democrats in their campaign for power. The point, however, lies 
in something different: privileges stimulate corruption, if they 
are not open and known to society, but are secret. 
  I have something else in mind: not only is conformism 
widespread among by no means ordinary statesmen, but also a 
readiness to "swap" their political, civic duty for material and 
other blessings, for the favors of the top echelons, and also 
for the strides of authority encouraging this trend. Commonplace 
on our public scene are the figures of the guardians of the law 
who manipulate original documents with impunity; generals, 
changing the oath; deputies hastily privatizing their official 
quarters; public prosecutors submitting their formal charges to 
the press; democrats worshiping Pinochet; finally, writers 
kissing up to the authorities. 
  What is unbearably bad, though, is the penetration of this 
trend into the relations between various branches of power. Was 
it not in this spirit that the proposal that the Russian 
deputies leave the White House in exchange for material reward 
was sustained in the pre-October days? Can we not now see the 
obvious striving to make the conditions of work and everyday 
life of the deputies of the State Duma dependent on their 
"correct" behavior? Look how Vitaliy Kolbasyuk, in NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA, describes the mutual relations of the Moscow municipal 
council and city duma: "The State machine was attached to each 
of its members, and now they are quietly finding apartments for 
the people's chosen ones. Perhaps that is why there are no 
scandals in the city duma, and the Moscow duma members, fully 
dependent on the municipal council, but with no grounds for 
complaining that they are paid no attention, are working 
fruitfully." 
  Such phenomena, of course, also occur in other countries, 
but 
usually do not emerge at the level of political manners. World 
experience has already reliably proved that the leadership of 
the executive power is above the representative, and 
anti-democratic structures and procedures are breeding 
corruption. 
  Corruption and corrupters have advanced far, very far in our 
country. It is bitter to realize it, but the immune 
anti-corruption potential of society has been seriously 
undermined. The boundlessness and falsehood of the hired pens 
surrounding it has dulled the people's reaction, and many have 
succeeded in suggesting that this is, if not a normal, then in 
any case, a common and inevitable phenomenon. 
  There is no doubt about it, corruption has already turned 
into an obstacle that is hard for any course of reform -- shock 
or otherwise -- to surmount. This, by the way, is one of the 
reasons why in Russia "enlightened authoritarianism" is 
impossible and doesn't work. Its reform is conceivable only 
along a democratic path and at the hands of democrats who are 
not mercenary-minded. The fight against corruption, naturally, 
should be the programmed task of all true democrats and patriots 
-- both those in the corridors of power and those opposing it.

Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and "Materials from" 
"Report by the Ministry of Internal Affairs to Russia's 
Citizens" under the "ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Exclusive" rubric: "We 
Will Conquer Crime Jointly" 
  [Text] We hope that this report on our work, 
published for the first time ever in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, will 
help to give an objective impression of the results and problems 
of the operational and service activity of MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] organs and troops. 
  At the same time we would like Russians to realize that 
the capacity of law enforcement organs to perform the tasks 
assigned to them increases in direct proportion to the support 
given to them by the entire population. 
  Therefore Russia's MVD addresses all citizens, 
political parties and movements, public and religious 
organizations, state employees, entrepreneurs, and workers in 
state and commercial structures with an appeal to rally for the 
sake of the nationwide cause -- the struggle against crime. 
  Each and every one of us must realize that a war is being 
waged against crime and that if the organs of law and order and 
society's healthy forces give in to the murderers, violent 
criminals, thieves, robbers, embezzlers, and corrupt elements of 
all hues, there will be no future for Russia. 
  We appeal to all Russians not to remain passive onlookers of 
other people's grief and human suffering, to perform their civic 
and moral duty, and to help us in imposing order in the country, 
fully exercising at the same time their legitimate right to 
necessary self-defense. 
  We ask the Russian parliament not to delay the adoption of 
legislative acts on immediate measures in the struggle against 
crime, especially organized crime and corruption. 
  We address the federal and local organs of power and 
self-government to give the MVD organs material, technical, and 
financial support. Miserliness in the struggle against crime 
works out too expensive. 
  We address the Russian intelligentsia, our teachers, the 
workers in science and the arts, and the clergy: Help us by 
means of your moral example, words, and deeds in these hard 
times. 
  We are fully determined to strengthen our cooperation with 
journalists and render the MVD's system as open as possible to 
them. 
  We appeal to the young people -- talented, morally and 
physically staunch, and prepared to make sacrifices for the sake 
of the law's triumph -- to join our ranks. 
  We address the older generation and the veterans. Believe 
us, your lives have not been in vain. We appeal to you: Carry 
on educating the young generation in the spirit of patriotism 
and love for the fatherland, the spirit of respect for the 
letter and spirit of the law and the people upholding it. 
  Entrepreneurs and representatives of state economic and 
commercial structures: Your successful activity based on the 
law means more than just your good reputation and your personal 
prosperity. It is also the path to our society's prosperity. 
Do not resent spending money on the struggle against crime and 
on social and charitable programs, help people in distress. 
Society will be grateful for your self-sacrifice and 
benevolence. 
  Citizens of Russia! We have a common and extremely dangerous 
enemy threatening our national security -- crime. We will 
succeed in defeating it only through joint efforts by the whole 
of society, through resolute and offensive actions. 
  [signed] Russian MVD 
  The internal affairs organs and the Internal Troops 
performed 
their operational and service tasks in complex sociopolitical 
and economic conditions distinguished by persistent inflation, 
deterioration of the prosperity of some groups of the 
population, and growing social tension. 
  Nonetheless, quite a large volume of law enforcement work 
was 
done. Some 1.263 million people were charged [izoblicheno] with 
having committed crimes, and money and valuables worth 168 
billion rubles [R] and more than one tonne of precious metals 
were confiscated from them. 
  For the first time in the last five years, the growth of 
crime has been somewhat contained thanks to the joint efforts by 
state and regional structures. Crime rose by only 1.4 percent 
in 1993. Crime has been reduced in virtually every other region 
in Russia. 
  The system of the Russian MVD's organs and troops has proved 
in deed that it is a stably functioning state structure, capable 
of mobilizing itself and effectively performing its set tasks. 
Attempts by certain political forces to impair its work and 
compromise it have failed. 
  This was helped by the policy, firmly pursued by Russia's 
president and government, of stepping up the struggle against 
crime, consolidating law and order, and giving maximum support 
to the activity of MVD organs and troops. 
  The federal executive power took a step without precedent in 
the MVD organs' history -- centralized allocation of 
considerable manpower resources. A program for the 
stage-by-stage material and technical backup for internal 
affairs organs through 1995 was adopted at state level for the 
first time. 
  The activity of internal affairs organs will also be 
improved 
as a result of the reform launched on the Russian MVD's 
initiative, whose purpose is to consolidate the basic link -- 
city and rayon forces -- and to subordinate the entire 
operational and service activity to the protection of the civil 
rights and freedoms guaranteed by the new Constitution of the 
Russian Federation. 
<H5>  Crime Prevention </H5>
  The crime prevention measures adopted in 1993 failed to 
produce the expected results. 
  Serious crime continued to increase. The level of 
criminality also increased somewhat. 
  Russia's MVD, within the limits of its potential, countered 
criminality by large-scale utilization of the available men, 
equipment, and weapons along the most important avenues of the 
struggle against crime and in regions with complex operational 
conditions. A series of large-scale operational and preventive 
operations were conducted at interregional and federal levels. 
Just two of them -- "Signal" and "Podrostok," conducted 
simultaneously in 26 regions, resulted in the detention of 
28,000 criminals, the institution of administrative proceedings 
against more than 870,000 offenders, and the solution of about 
2,000 cases of theft and vehicle theft. 
  Attention was given to the prevention of violent crimes 
associated with drunkenness, gross behavior, moral squalor, 
personal animosity among some people, senseless and savage 
fights, and bodily harm and murder for domestic reasons. 
  Last year, and with a view to improving the situation in 
everyday life, control was established over 43,700 locations 
with high concentration of criminogenic elements, including 
34,000 dens of alcoholics and drug addicts. Some 290,000 
alcoholics and 6,500 drug addicts were committed to voluntary or 
compulsory treatment. 
  Adiministrative legislation was actively applied for 
preventive purposes. Proceedings for petty hooliganism were 
instituted against 1.168 million persons and 254,000 persons 
guilty of scandalous debauched behavior within the family. 
  Persons returning from places of detention were monitored by 
the militia. Any actions by those among them who attemted to 
resume their past activity were cut short. Criminal proceedings 
were instituted against 287,000, and administrative proceedings 
against 280,000 persons who had committed crimes previously. 
  One of the main tasks was to prevent child vagrancy and 
offenses by adolescents. Some 267,000 "difficult" adolescents 
were taken under preventive supervision. As a result of the 
work that was done, about 130,000 were taken off the records due 
to their rehabilitation. Measures were taken against 63,000 
parents who were neglecting their children's upbringing, and 
case files on 13,000 of them were sent to the courts to decide 
the question of deprivation of parental rights. 
  But there was no success in halting the growth of 
adolescent crime. 
  The reason is that the level of society's moral influence on 
the younger generation declined everywhere. The numerous 
science and technology study circles and free sports facilities 
for children have closed down. The number of adolescents 
without parental supervision has increased. 
  Many organs of local self-government have ceased paying 
attention to jobs for adolescents and the organization of their 
free time. Whereas two-thirds of minors on the militia's 
records vacationed out of the cities in 1988, only one-third did 
so last year. 
  Generally speaking, the negative changes in the status of 
criminality are the consequence of social prohlems associated 
with the weakening of state power, the growth of legal 
nihilism, the moral degradation of some groups of the 
population, the aggravation of the population's incomes 
differentiation, and the emergence of the destitute and the 
unemployed. 
  Russia's MVD realizes that these problems can be solved only 
at state level. Therefore, much hope is pinned on the federal 
program for the struggle against crime, the revival of the 
system of social law enforcement formations and the revision of 
its purpose, and the cooperation with religious organizations, 
commissions for minors' affairs, guardianship and health care 
organs, employment services, and centers for the social 
protection of children and adolescents. 
  A reliable juridical base is also necessary in order to 
solve 
the problems of crime prevention and law enforcement. Last year 
Russia's MVD was involved in the preparation of 70 draft laws 
and legal acts of the Russian Federation president and 
governments, which are already in force. 
  But legislation is obviously lagging behind the 
realities of life. 
  The law enforcement organs especially need the earliest 
possible adoption of new criminal, criminal procedure, and penal 
codes. They would provide the basis of their activity. 
  Russia's MVD has addressed the State Duma with a request to 
urgently consider the draft laws on key problems of the struggle 
against crime and the functioning of the law enforcement system, 
and hopes that deputies will support it. 
<H5>  Results of the Work To Investigate and Solve Crimes </H5>
  The duty sections of internal affairs organs are the main 
organizers of the solution of crime "hot on the trail." Last 
year they organized up to 1.5 million scene-of-crime visits by 
investigating operations groups. Crimes solved "hot on the 
trail" with participation by duty sections accounted for 44.8 
percent of the total. 
  A large volume of the work to solve crimes was done by 
criminal investigation detectives, criminology experts, 
investigators, and officials from other services. 
  The clear-up rate improved somewhat thanks to their hard 
work 
(from 46.9 percent in 1992 to 50.6 percent in 1993). Some 1.395 
million crimes were solved, including 273,000 serious crimes. 
  Broad publicity was given to the solution of the serial 
murders of women and children committed by the sex maniacs 
Golovkin and Ryakhovskiy in Moscow Oblast and Tsyuman in Rostov 
Oblast, of the three monks in Optinaya Pustyna, and the armed 
raid on Krasnoyarsk Kray's Mostovskiy Rayon Internal Affairs 
Department. Unique treasures worth R10 billion were recovered 
from robbers who stole them from the arts combine museum in 
Dagestan's settlement of Kubachi. 
  Internal affairs organs, jointly with the Russian Army and 
subunits of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, 
successfully conducted a unique operation last December to 
release the school pupils seized by bandits in Rostov-na-Donu -- 
one of the most complex operations in the entire world practice 
in the struggle against terrorism. 
  On the whole, the personnel were more resolute in 
counteracting the criminal elements. Last year staffers of the 
internal affairs organs used firearms on 2,200 occasions to deal 
with crime, and in this process 376 dangerous criminals who 
offered armed resistance were killed. 
  The investigations apparatus is a key link among the 
services and subdivisions providing backup for the solution of 
crimes. 
  Last year investigators of the internal affairs organs 
handled 2.7692 million criminal cases. Investigations of 
753,000 cases were completed (up 12.6 percent), and 542,000 of 
these (up 20.2 percent) were sent on to prosecutors with the 
appropriate indictments. Some 437,700 suspects were detained 
during preliminary investigations, and almost two-thirds of them 
were subsequently arrested. 
  But the principle of the inevitability of punishment was not 
fully applied. About one-half of all crimes -- 1.364 million, 
725,000 of which involved theft of personal property -- remained 
unsolved. No culprits were identified in 6,400 murder cases, 
21,200 cases of grievous bodily harm, 18,900 robberies with 
violence, and 114,900 burglaries. One out of every four persons 
missing without trace and on the federal list of wanted persons 
was never found. 
  In 1994, Russia's MVD will tighten up to the utmost its 
requirements as regards results from the work to solve crimes. 
A package of measures has been elaborated and is being 
implemented to expose persons engaged in racketeering or 
committing contract murders, burglaries, robberies with 
violence, hijackings of motor vehicles, and thefts of cultural 
treasures. We still have to improve the system for tracing 
criminals who are on the run from investigation and court 
proceedings and persons who have vanished without trace, 
especially those who have disappeared in criminal circumstances. 
  The work of tracing operations groups will be stepped up to 
expose extortionists, robbers, thieves, organizers of fraudulent 
gambling, and other criminal elements. 
  At the same time, these and other measures will not yield 
the desired results unless an end is put to the persistent 
judicial practice of passing unjustifiably soft sentences on 
persons guilty of committing serious crimes. 
  During the first half of last year, and despite the 
commission of crimes in aggravating circumstances, criminal 
punishment sentences not involving detention were passed on 
about 60 percent of persons guilty of thefts and on more than 50 
percent of persons involved in robberies. 
  The courts passed detention sentences on only 9.2 percent of 
officials and other persons in positions of responsibility found 
guilty of embezzlement by misappropriation, fraud, or abuse of 
office in aggravating circumstances. 
  Almost 42 percent of criminals who had committed 
embezzlement 
on especially large scale went free. Just over one-third of 
corrupt functionaries, proved by militia staffers to be guilty 
of bribery, were given real detention sentences. 
<H5>  The Struggle Against Organized and Armed Crime and Corruption </H5>
  Last year the internal affairs organs exposed 5,700 
organized crime groups, this being one-third more than in 1992. 
  Criminal proceedings were instituted against 11,400 
organizers and active members of criminal groupings. One out of 
every six groups engaged in interregional criminal activities, 
while more than 300 groupings committed criminal actions outside 
Russia either jointly with criminal elements from nearby and 
distant foreign countries, or autonomously. 
  According to operational data, there was a total of almost 
150 major criminal fraternities operating across Russia's 
territory and controlling the activity of several thousand 
numerically smaller and less organized groupings. According to 
operational data, their sphere of influence extended over more 
than 35,000 entities engaged in economic activity. 
  These mafia-style fraternities tried to divide the 
federation's territory into spheres of influence, got actively 
involved in the economy, and lobbied for their interests with 
power structures at all levels, using in this process bribery, 
blackmail, threats, and direct violence. 
  In these conditions, Russia's MVD was forced to undertake 
the 
creation of a fundamentally new system of organs for the 
struggle against organized crime -- strictly centralized, 
enjoying reliable operational information, and having at their 
disposal specialized mobile rapid reaction combat subdivisions. 
  Their contribution to the struggle against organized crime 
is 
already more substantial. Forces from regional administrations 
for organized crime, in collaboration with other services of 
internal affairs organs, eliminated a considerable number of 
dangerous gang formations and confiscated from the criminals 
more than 1,100 cars, about 500 radio transmitters, and 11,700 
firearms. MVD organs confiscated from illegal circulation 
53,000 firearms, including 7,400 rifled weapons. 
  The struggle against corruption was stepped up somewhat. 
  Some 4,500 instances of bribery (up 34.8 percent) and about 
1,500 officials in breach of the president's edict on the 
struggle against corruption were exposed. Two-thirds of those 
officials were dismissed from office or incurred different forms 
of punishment. 
  At the same time, Russia's MVD is highly critical of the 
results of the struggle against organized crime and corruption. 
  Many corrupt functionaries still engage in graft with 
impunity, illegally open accounts with banks abroad, acquire 
real estate abroad, and include their relatives as cofounders of 
commercial structures sponsored by them. 
  So far there have been few results from efforts to solve 
criminal explosions and contract murders, including murders of 
bankers and entrepreneurs, committed by criminal fraternities. 
  The aggressiveness of the struggle against such criminal 
activity is also held back by the absence of laws "On Struggle 
Against Organized Crime," "On State Protection of Judges and 
Staffers of Law Enforcement and Monitoring Organs," "On 
Protection of Witnesses, Victims, and Other Persons Cooperating 
with Criminal Proceedings," and "On Immunity from Criminal 
Liability as a Result of Effective Repentance and Participation 
in Operational Investigations Activity." 
  This year Russia's MVD is preparing new targeted strikes 
against criminal groups operating in the sphere of motor 
vehicles production and engaged in the marketing of stolen cars, 
including abroad; gang formations raiding railroad junctions, 
highways, airports, and coastal and border regions. 
  It is planned to conduct large-scale operations in the 
struggle against organized crime, primarily in regions where 
criminal groupings are most active. The sources and channels 
for the illegal circulation of weapons, ammunition, and 
explosives will be resolutely blocked. It is planned to conduct 
comprehensive stocktaking of weapons wherever they are 
manufactured, transported, stored, or used. 
  At the same, time, efforts are being stepped up in the 
struggle against drugs trafficking. Last year already saw the 
detection of 53,200 such crimes (an increase by a factor of 
1.8). There were twice as many detected instances of the 
manufacture and marketing of drugs (8,200 cases). More than 54 
tonnes of drugs and narcotic plants were confiscated, and about 
300 underground laboraties were eliminated, including 
laboratories producing synthetic drugs. 
  But the efforts of internal affairs organs alone are clearly 
not enough. The activity of medical institutions dealing with 
the cure of drug addicts is being curtailed. There is a lack of 
the necessary means and effective methods to destroy the raw 
materials base of drug addiction, while more than 1 million 
hectares of Russian land are polluted by hemp growing in the 
wild. 
  This is why Russia's MVD devotes the most serious attention 
to the elaborated of a federal targeted program of 
"Comprehensive Measures To Counter the Abuse and Illegal 
Trafficking of Drugs in 1994-1995." 
<H5>  Ensuring Economic Security, Protecting the Consumer Market </H5>
  The criminal militia subdivisions exposed 110,400 crimes in 
this sphere. The number of exposed cases of large and 
especially large embezzlement increased by one-fourth (to reach 
7,500). 
  The most serious economic crimes were exposed and blocked in 
the sphere of credit and banking relations. Criminals exploited 
to the utmost loopholes in legislation and shortcomings in the 
organization of banking activity, specifically the flaws in the 
system of interbank settlements, the lack of security along the 
channels for transmission of payment documents, and the breaches 
by commercial banks of elementary rules for conducting money 
operations. This resulted in large-scale swindles involving 
forged payment advices and "Rossiya" checks, illegal acquisition 
and utilization of preferential credits, and other mercenary 
abuses. 
  The MVD organs, within the limits of their powers, countered 
these crimes which are essentially financial 
sabotage. There were 4,300 crimes successfully exposed in 
the banking system in 1993, including cases of embezzlement 
whose number increased by a factor of 3.7. The misappropriation 
of almost R2 trillion was prevented, and 429 criminal groupings 
were exposed. 
  A Russian Federation Interdepartmental Commission for 
Questions of Cooperation Between Banks and law Enforcement 
Organs was created with a view to imposing order in banking 
affairs. Additional proposals are being elaborated, aimed at 
enhancing the status and efficiency of this coordinating organ. 
  In the conditions of the state border's "transparency," 
measures were taken to prevent the exportation of oil products, 
strategically important raw materials, other commodities subject 
to quota limitations, and foreign currency assets. More than 
9,000 crimes involving the illegal exportation of strategic raw 
and other materials were exposed. Operation "Trawl" alone, 
conducted jointly with other law enforcement organs, blocked the 
illegal exportation of 97,900 tonnes of oil products, 17,800 
tonnes of metal, and goods in short supply worth more than R18 
billion. 
  A struggle was waged againt the counterfeiting of money. 
  The release of counterfeit money to a total of more than 
R1.5 
billion and $650,000 into circulation was prevented; counterfeit 
Russian money to a total of R9.4 billion and privatization 
checks to a total value of R64 million were confiscated from 
circulation. Proceedings were instituted against more than 400 
makers and distributiors of counterfeit bank notes. But 
subdivisions of the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank, and 
Goznak [Main Administration for Production of State Bank Notes, 
Coins, and Medals] must immediately take the most resolute 
measures to protect Russian currency against forgeries. This is 
the only way to halt this criminal aggression. 
  Some 27,700 crimes involving privatization checks were 
exposed. Numerous instances were discovered when the balance 
sheet value of facilities being privatized had been reduced, or 
when facilities whose privatization was prohibited had been 
either sold or leased with the right to subsequent purchase. 
  Some measures were implemented to impose order in the 
consumer market. Last year saw the exposure of about 15,000 
instances when purchasers were defrauded, and 5,000 cases of 
illegal enterprise. 
  But the measures being taken are still ineffective and the 
process of criminalization in individual spheres of the economy 
is swelling. In order to contain it, we need measures, 
coordinated at federal government level, to improve the entire 
economic mechanism's work. 
  More aggressive actions are also needed by monitoring 
organs. 
There is only slow advance in the process of setting up 
subdivisions of the tax police, the antimonopoly committee, the 
foreign currency and export control services, the alcohol 
inspectorate, and others. 
  Russia's MVD, jointly with other ministries and departments, 
plans to institute rigid control over the utilization of all 
kinds of financial and credit benefits; to continue its 
inspections of the formation of initial capital in commercial 
structures, primarily those created by utilizing state property. 
  It is also planned to conduct an inspection of the legality 
of barter deals involving the delivery of rare-earth and 
nonferrous metals and of fish and other produce to nearby and 
distant foreign countries. 
  There will be an investigative operations audit in 40 
regions 
to cover almost 1,300 entities engaged in entrepreneurial 
activity, which are directly or indirectly involved in 
embezzling from the banking system R80 billion using forged 
paytment advices and R68 billion using the unauthorized entry of 
false data in the computer network of the Central Bank of Russia 
Main Payments and Cash Center. 
  It is planned to give assistance to customs organs and 
border 
guards in cities with international sea and river ports and 
airports. 
<H5>  Ensuring Public Order and Protecting Property </H5>
  About 100,000 precinct patrol details covered the streets of 
Russia's population centers to ensure public order. They took 
part in solving 73,300 crimes, including 30,300 thefts, 
burglaries, and robberies with violence. 
  The OMON [special purpose militia detachment] servicemen 
made 
a certain contribution toward ensuring public order. Several 
additional such detachments were formed last year. Now they 
exist in 77 republic, kray, and oblast centers, as well as in 20 
cities with a population of more than 300,000. 
  But there was no success in halting the growth of acts 
of violence and vandalism in Russia's city streets. They 
were the scene of 334,000 crimes, or of one out of every eight. 
  This is to a certain extent due to the fact that patrols are 
understrength. Many organs of state power in Federation 
components and organs of local self-government are in no hurry 
to implement the demands of the Russian president's edict on the 
public safety militia. Consequently, the strength of patrols in 
the Federation as a whole is just over 50 percent of the set 
normatives. This service is staffed only 15-30 percent in 
Novgorod, Orel, Tver, Rostov, and Chita Oblasts. 
  In the conditions of militia cadre shortage, Russia's MVD 
was 
forced to ask the public for help. Following an initiative by 
MVD organs, voluntary people's militia detachments, including 
Cossack detachments, resumed their activity in Krasnodar and 
Stavropol Krays and in Astrakhan, Vladimir, Volgograd, Vologda, 
Voronezh, Rostov, Samara, and Yaroslavl Oblasts. The first 
15,000 members of voluntary people's militia detachments also 
appeared in Moscow. 
  The potential of 3,000 nonstate protection and detection 
structures, legislatively authorized to use gas weapons and 
personal protection means, started being utilized for the sake 
of ensuring public order. Thus, jointly with Moscow Oblast's 
Noginskiy Rayon Internal Affairs Administration, one such 
protection enterprise performs special missions to prevent 
thefts and the uanthorized tacking of motor vehicles and 
participates in motor vehicles inspections. And this is not an 
isolated example. 
  Russia's MVD is enhancing its demandingness toward the 
precinct patrol service, the external appearance, helpfulness, 
and proper behavior of patrolmen, and their initiative and 
determination in dealing with offenses. A system of daily 
reporting and monitoring the work of each staffer of this 
service is being introduced. 
  There will also be an enhancement of the personal 
responsibility borne by precinct inspectors for the state of law 
and order, the management of militia details on their territory, 
and their constant contacts with the population. 
  Last year they solved more than 232,000 crimes, including a 
large number of domestically-motivated cases of murder and 
grievous bodily harm, as well as mercenary offenses. 
  Extradepartmental protection ensured the safeguarding of the 
property of citizens and installations under all forms of 
ownership. This service protected 485,000 blocks and apartments 
and about 300,000 enterprises, banking institutions, stores, and 
warehouses. There were about 3,000 centralized protection 
centers in operation. Some 8,500 armed security groups with the 
right of arrest [vooruzhennaya gruppa zaderzhaniya] operated 
around the clock. 
  The relaibility of protection remains quite stable. On 
average, there is success in preventing 96 percent of attempted 
thefts from protected facilities. As a result of this, thefts 
of property worth many billions of rubles have been prevented. 
  The protection of facilities for the storage of weapons, 
narcotics, precious metals, historical and artistic treasures, 
and expensive consumer goods will be stepped up in 1994. 
  At present the extradepartmental protection service has the 
latest alarm and warning systems and sufficient manpower. We 
have a chance to conclude contracts for the protection of 
commercial banks, offices, and so on. All we need is for 
leaders of enterprises under all forms of ownership to show 
interest in cooperating with protection service subdivisions. 
<H5>  Ensuring Road and Fire Safety </H5>
  A certain volume of work has been done in the sphere of 
ensuring road safety. Gross violations of the Road Traffic 
Regulations resulted in the detention of 26 million drivers, 
including 1.69 million for driving motor vehicles while drunk. 
  State Motor Vehicles Inspectorate [GAI] staffers detected 
more than 5 million instances of drivers breaking the speed 
limit and 2.3 million cases of breaches of seat belt regulations. 
  Despite the measures that have been taken, the number of 
deaths on the roads reached 37,120, while 192,800 Russians were 
maimed or injured. 
  The deterioration of the quality of Russian roads 
made a significant contribution to the high incidence of road 
accidents. The standards elaborated by the MVD, jointly with the 
Russian Ministry of Transport, for the building and maintenance 
of roads were not observed by the majority of economic 
organizations. 
  The new Road Traffic Regulations are designed to enhance 
road 
safety. They regularize road traffic in housing zones and 
farming areas. They clearly define the militia staffers' rights 
as regards subjecting drivers to breathalyzer tests and the 
verification of drivers' knowledge of the rules and their 
driving habits. It is planned to introduce an annual technical 
inspection of motor vehicles which have been in circulation for 
more than five years and are used for entrepreneurial activity. 
  Motor vehicles belonging to foreign legal entities and 
citizens (excluding diplomats) are now subject to state 
technical inspection. 
  At the same time, Russia's MVD perceives the high incidence 
of road accidents also as a consequence of the inefficiency of 
GAI's work. The monitoring of motor vehicles' technical 
condition remains inadequate. There are frequent instances of 
rash decisions to regulate road traffic. The problems of GAI 
staffers' participation in the tracing of hijacked and stolen 
vehicles were resolved only slowly. 
  Bearing in mind the extremely complex situation on the 
roads, 
Russia's MVD has instructed the GAI to adopt the strictest legal 
measures against deliberate offenders and to tighten its 
monitoring of the observance of rules, normatives, and standards 
operating in this sphere by departments, organizations, and 
citizens. 
  Measures are also being taken to establish an interregional 
determent system of militia control points on the highways. The 
federal computer system for tracing motor vehicles will be 
brought up to design strength. 
  Intense struggle was waged against fires. The measures that 
were taken made it possible to reduce their incidence in 26 of 
Russia's republics, krays, and oblasts. There were fewer fires 
in buildings for production purposes, stockbreeding premises, 
and other agricultural production facilities. Fires are less 
frequently started as a result of breaches of rules governing 
the installation and use of electrical equipment and domestic 
electrical appliances. A total of more than 710,600 fires were 
prevented, while 30,100 persons and material assets worth R94.2 
billion were saved from fires. 
  Nonetheless, there were 331,400 fires in Russia last year 
(5.9 percent more than in 1992), causing damage worth R203.9 
billion. The loss of human life as a result of fires reached 
13,700 persons. One out of every five dead persons was a child. 
Some 11,500 persons suffered injuries and burns. 
  This is mainly the result of noncompliance with the 
elementary demands of fire safety by officials and citizens. 
There was an especially large number of violations at 
facilities of the power industry, the timber processing 
industry, and railroad transport. 
  One out of every three fires was in a rural 
locality. Meanwhile, only one-third of collective farms 
have voluntary fire brigades, and their number is steadily 
declining. 
  The federal program "Fire Safety and Social Protection" was 
adopted last year on the initiative of Russia's MVD. It 
envisages a package of measures to develop the fire fighting 
service infrastructure, strengthen fire safety in the 
countryisde, and convert the professional fire fighting service 
into a militarized service. It is necessary to work on and 
resolve the question of creating municipal fire fighting service 
subdivisions funded from local budgets. 
<H5>  On the Work of Passport and Visa Subdivisions </H5>
  An autonomous Passport and Visa Service of the internal 
affairs organs was established last year in compliance with 
legislation. 
  The passport and visa subdivisions started their work in 
complex conditions. The issue of foreign travel passports, 
valid for five years and multiple journeys to all countries in 
the world, has resulted in long lines and in citizens' 
dissatisfaction with the long time it takes to deal with their 
applications. 
  Russia's MVD critically appraised the prevailing situation. 
Last May the government decided to reinforce the service by 
7,600 units and ensured its supply of blank foreign travel 
passports, thus partially alleviating the existing problems. 
  Last year the passport and visa subdivisions processed and 
issued to citizens a total of 3 million passports for temporary 
travel abroad (against 1.5 million in 1992), as well as 114,000 
passports to people traveling to take up permanent residence 
abroad (103,700 in 1992). 
  In addition to this, the service systematically monitored 
the 
rules governing residence by foreign citizens in the Russian 
Federation. Administrative proceedings were instituted against 
9,400 foreigners. The commission of offenses resulted in the 
forcible (under escort) deportation of 643 citizens of foreign 
states (354 in 1992). 
  In fulfillment of the Russian federation president's edict 
"On the State Seal of the Russian Federation," the service 
prepared a mockup of a new-style passport for Russian citizens. 
It is expected that it will be issued to tens of thousands of 
young people in the new year (provided it is approved). 
  A new procedure governing citizens' travel abroad, in line 
with the most rigorous international law standards, came in 
force in Russia 1 January 1993. Passports are issued to all who 
apply for them. The time for the processing of applications has 
been reduced (up to one month for temporary travel, up to three 
months for travel to take up permanent residence). 
  In the new year Russia's MVD requested the service's leaders 
to ensure compliance with the set time limits for dealing with 
citizens' applications and applications sponsored by 
organizations, as well as the proper standards when dealing with 
the population and processing applications for foreign travel 
documents. 
<H5>  On the Penal Organs' Work </H5>
  At the beginning of 1994 corrective labor institutions held 
about 600,000 persons, including 21,600 women and 19,100 
adolescents. In addition to this, 233,500 persons were held in 
pre-trial detention centers and jails. 
  The "criminogenic composition" of convicts deteriorated 
sharply. About one-half of them were serving punishment 
for violent crimes, 60 percent were repeat offenders, and more 
than 15 percent were alcoholics and drug addicts. 
  At the same time, there were also certain positive changes 
in 
the work to restore order in the [penal] colonies. The number 
of murders at places of detention declined by 25 percent, the 
number of escapes by one-third, and the number of mass 
disturbances by two-thirds. 
  Whereas the liberalization of the detention regime for 
convicts in the late eighties mainly boiled down to imposing 
softer punishment for offenses on rarer occasions, the policy 
now is to differentiate between the conditions of detention. 
  Russian penal legislation is now largely in line with world 
standards (but this cannot be said about the conditions of 
detention). Last year about 55,000 persons took advantage of 
the right to take leave involving travel beyond the place of 
detention, and 97 percent of them returned safely. 
  Punishment in the form of deprivation of visits, parcels, 
and 
letters, and of the shaving off of hair has been abolished. The 
legendary form of address as "Citizen Chief" has receded into 
the past -- convicts now can address representatives of the 
administration by their name and patronymic. Provision has been 
made for the convict's right to personal safety. If he is under 
threat of retribution by his "comrades" in detention, it is 
incumbent upon the adminisrration to take measures, right up to 
and including his transfer to another institution. Those who 
are serving sentences are guaranteed the freedom to practise 
their religion. At the same time, the law has increased to 
eight years' detention the punishment for escape in aggravating 
circumstances. 
  The corrective labor institutions make a significant 
contribution to the country's economy. The value of industrial 
output reached R319 billion. Forest-based corrective labor 
institutions produced commodity output worth R84.1 billion. 
They produced 7 percent of all commercial lumber, 16 percent of 
all railroad ties, and 23 percent of all summer cabins. 
  At the same time, the corrective labor institutions' 
enterprises, just like our entire economy, are suffering from 
inflation and the slump in production. Many of their business 
partners, lacking economic interest in the utilization of 
convict labor, continue to curtail the production sharing ties 
established with corrective labor institutions and halt 
deliveries of material resources. Consequently, some 200,000 
convicts were without work by the end of last year and yet the 
right to work was already being granted as reward for good 
behavior. 
  Pre-trial detention centers found themselves is a 
particularly difficult situation. 
  Today two-thirds of pre-trial detention centers and jails 
are 
dilapidated and some are housed in stockades dating back to the 
times of the Empresses Elizabeth and Catherine. The wall at the 
local pre-trial detention center in Novokuznetsk collapsed due 
to dilapidation and it was only luck that nobody died beneath 
the rubble. These institutions are overcrowded by a factor of 
1.5 above the set norms, while overcrowding in some of them -- 
St. Petersburg's Kresty, Moscow's Butyrka, and Yekaterinburg's 
pre-trial detention center -- is by a factor of three to four. 
  Taking all these facts into account, Russia's government 
adopted a special decree to reinforce the material and technical 
base of pre-trial detention centers and jails. Given proper 
financing, the MVD will ensure its unconditional fulfillment. 
<H5>  Service Activity of the Russian MVD Internal Troops </H5>
  In 1993 the Internal troops, jointly with the militia, 
guarded public order and safety, the most important state 
facilities and cargoes, and corrective labor colonies, and 
escorted convicts and detainees. A 5,000-strong grouping of 
troops was permanently stationed in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. 
  Soldiers and Officers of MVD troops took part in 80 
operations. They detained more than 5,000 persons who had 
committed crimes and 430,000 persons who had committed 
administrative offenses, and confiscated from criminal elements 
1,150 firearms, about 3,000 units of cold steel weapons, 21 kg 
of explosives, 28,000 rounds of ammunition, and 16 units of 
armored equipment and artillery systems. 
  They vigilantly served to guard cargoes and special 
facilities, especially in the nuclear arms complex and the 
atomic industry. Patrols and soldiers' details detained 48,000 
persons attempting to penetrate these facilities, and recovered 
for the state embezzled material resources worth R1 billion. 
More than 200 attempts by convicts to escape from corrective 
labor institutions were thwarted. 
  There are numerous examples of selfless performance of 
service duty by the troops' personnel. During the hearing of a 
case at Dagestan's Supreme Court, seven armed gunmen opened fire 
in the court room in an attempt to free the defendants. The 
Internal Troops escort, although in the minority, skillfully 
used their weapons and, jointly with militia staffers, rendered 
the criminals harmless. 
  But the Internal Troops find it quite hard to perform their 
set tasks -- the units' manpower strength is only 53 percent. 
In 1993 this situation was remedied by recruitment for contract 
service. About 10,000 contract servicemen were selected and have 
started serving. 
  A state program for the development of Internal Troops 
through the year 2000 was adopted on the Russian MVD's 
initiative. It is planned to create subunits for direct 
struggle against crime and equip them with new equipment and 
weapons, and to use transport aviation to enhance the units' 
mobility and their readiness for immediate actions in any of 
Russia's regions where a threat to internal security may develop. 
  By 1996 the functions of guarding places of detention will 
pass fully to the penal system, as is done in the overwhelming 
majority of countries. The Internal troops will be given an 
opportunity to concentrate fully on their main task: To protect 
the rights and freedoms of citizens, maintain internal 
stability, and struggle against crime. 
<H5>  International Cooperation </H5>
  The preservation on the territory of the former USSR of a 
"single criminogenic space" has required that the Russian MVD 
conduct an active search in conjuction with the ministries of 
internal affairs of the CIS countries for measures to counteract 
crime. 
  With our partners in the "nearby foreign parts" 11 
multilateral agreements have been signed concerning cooperation 
in various fileds of activity by the internal affairs organs. A 
specific mechanism for implmenting these agreements was 
discussed at sessions of a specially created organ -- the 
Conference of Internal Affairs Ministers of the Indepedent 
States. 
  The formation of a standing Bureau has been started for 
coordinating the fight against organized crime and against 
transnational groupings engaged in sophisticated extortion, 
weapons dealings, and banditry. 
  Apart from that, bilateral agreements have been concluded 
with the MVD's of Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Latvia, 
Kazakhstan, Armenia, Tajikistan, and Lithuania. 
  Interstate cooperation has progressed furthest of all 
in the sphere of combating the illegal traffic in 
narcotics. "Monitored deliveries" operations carried out 
jointly with the special services of foreign countries made it 
possible to arrest in Paris and Stockholm four citizens of 
Ghana, Liberia, Jamaica, and France involved in drugs 
trafficking. 
  Cooperation within the framework of Interpol is expanding. 
Of the 117 member countries of this organization, 115 cooperate 
with Russia's MVD. An up-to-date system of protective 
communications has being commissioned which makes it possible 
within 10-15 minuites to verify when and in which country a 
particular stolen vehicle was taken, and to carry out 
operational exchanges of information of other kinds with the 
general secretariat and national bureaus in Interpol's member 
countries. 
  In total, using Interpol's potential, 2,689 crimes were 
cleared up in 1993 including 1,257 motor vehicle thefts, 511 
economic crimes, 277 cases of the counterfeiting of money and of 
securities, 139 thefts of items of cultural value, and 109 
crimes against the person. 
<H5>  Material-Technical, and Financial Support </H5>
  The Russian MVD has done a certain amount of work on 
improving the material-technical, and financial support of the 
internal affairs organs. 
  However, the criminal world has kept pace with us and 
sometimes even overtaken us, having at its disposal modern 
weapons, efficient electronic instruments for observation, for 
monitoring of communications channels, and fast foreign-made 
transport means. 
  In 1993 the MVD organs' level of provision with equipment 
for 
operational and criminal detection purposes stood at 75 percent, 
automobiles and buses -- 65 percent, specialized transport for 
various purposes -- 46 percent, bullet-proof vests and handcuffs 
-- 50-70 percent. Because of a shortage of finance we were 
unable to acquire in excess of 7,000 passenger cars, 8,000 
trucks, 136 buses, and a considerable quantity of other 
equipment. The Russian MVD's indebtedness to industrial 
enterprises amounted to R27.5 billion rubles. 
  Operational services experienced a deficit of essential 
equipment. Last year every fourth motor vehicle in alert-duty 
units had to be written off. Duty vehicles were 70-percent 
provisioned with fuel and lubricants. Subunits concerned with 
organized crime were provided with less than half the necessary 
number of transport means and with only 40 percent of the 
computers, video equipment, movie and still cameras. 
  In 1994 appropriations in the order of R16 trillion and 
capital investment in the sum of R915 billion are required for 
the needs of the MVD organs, including finance for the State 
program for the phased development of the material-technical 
support of the internal affairs organs's operational-service 
activity for 1993-1995. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  The results of the operational-service activity of the 
internal affairs organs and internal troops during 1993 were 
discussed at an enlarged sitting of the Russian MVD collegium 
with the participation of Government Chairman V.S. Chernomyrdin, 
all the leaders of the MVD, main internal affairs directorates, 
internal affairs directorates, internal affairs directorates of 
the territories, district commanders of internal troops, chiefs 
of training establishments, and of a number of other subunits. 
  Serious concern was voiced to the participants in the 
session 
over the crime situation that is taking shape in the country. 
The results of work were subjected to comprehensive, objective, 
and critical analysis and the necessary additional measures were 
adumbrated. 
  The main task in 1994 is deemed to be the backup for the 
implementation of the provisions of the new Constitution of the 
Russian Federation, and reliable protection for the rights and 
interests of the individual. 
  The collegium approved the directive of the Russian 
Federation minister of Internal Affairs "On the Basic Guidelines 
for the Operational-Service Activity of the Internal Affairs 
Organs and Internal Troops in 1994," which defines a package of 
measures for imposing order in the country and for the 
substantial improvement of the results of work with crime and 
ensuring public security. 
  The necessary adjustments are being made to the organization 
of the activity of the internal affairs organs and internal 
troops in connection with the Russian President's Message to the 
Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State."

sciences and deputy chief of the Strategic Research and 
Information Support Administration of the "Rosugol" Company: 
"Brief Summary of the Russian Coal Industry's Work from January 
to August 1993"] 
  [Text] 
<H6>  1. Coal Production </H6>
<H5>  1.1. Coal Extraction. </H5>
  Some 198.3 million metric tons of coal (plus 1.3 million 
metric tons toward the plan adopted by enterprises, 100.7 
percent) were extracted from January to August 1993; the decline 
in extaction compared with 1992 was 21.9 million metric tons 
(10.0 percent). 
  The trend of a decrease in the amount of coal mined, 
compared 
with 1992, is continuing; the rate of decrease rose 0.3 points 
(from 9.7 to 10.0 percent) from July to August. Compared with 
July, the amount of coal mined decreased by 949,000 metric tons, 
or 4.4 percent. 
  It should be noted that reduction of the volume of coal 
mined, compared with what was extracted in 1992, was stipulated 
in the plans of 28 of the 34 associations (82.4 percent), 
because the overall coal extraction plan was set lower by 23.2 
million metric tons (10.6 percent). 

<FIG ID=FBIS-USR-026-72A>           Coal Mined in 1993, By Months </FIG>





    Fifteen of the 37 joint-stock companies, associations, and 
concerns (40.5 percent) did not meet their plan targets, 
underfulfilling them by 1.35 million metric tons of coal.

  The principal reasons for the decrease in the volume of coal 
mined: 
  --the decline in effective demand for coal products; 
  --substantial reduction of capacities. It is expected that 
there will be a reduction of 22 million metric tons in 1993, at 
a time when provision is being made for the introduction of only 
12 million metric tons, that is, a negative balance on the order 
of 10 million metric tons; 
  --a decrease in the amount of preparatory operations 
conducted, and as a consequence, lack of the needed number of 
stoping faces. Stripping and development workings at the mines 
were reduced by 82.4 kilometers (11.0 percent) compared with 
1992, and the average number of stoping faces in operation 
decreased by 44.7 faces (6.0 percent). For this reason, 
extraction losses in the January-August 1993 period added up to 
4.9 million metric tons. At open pits, the planned volume of 
stripping over the 8-month period was underfulfilled by 41.4 
million cubic meters (6.5 percent), a reduction of 43.1 million 
cubic meters (6.8 percent) compared with 1992; 
  --the lack of material and technical resources in the 
volumes 
needed (70 percent of the rolled ferrous metals, 60 percent of 
the timber for pit props, 35 percent of the flexible and power 
cable, 21 percent of the electric locomotives, and 48 percent of 
the ties were delivered), caused mainly by the shortage of 
finances. This is having a harmful effect on the operation of 
mining equipment and increasing the number of injuries. 
Principally because of the high accident rate and equipment 
wear, the average daily load on a stoping face has decreased by 
16 metric tons (3.2 percent) compared with last year, and coal 
extraction losses because of this were 1.3 million metric tons 
higher than last year; and 
  --it also should be noted that coal extraction losses 
because 
of the stoppages at coal mining enterprises in the Kuzbass in 
June (compulsory leave for workers because of insufficient funds 
to pay their wages) amounted to 600,000 metric tons and strikes 
in June (at Vorkuta) and in August (146 mines in Russia) 
resulted in losses of 213,000 metric tons. 
<H3>  1.2. The Processing and Output of Clean Coal, Large and 
Medium-Sized Grades and Briquets </H3>
  On the whole, enterprises engaged in processing coal have 
been operating steadily, based on the amount of coal brought to 
the mills. At the same time, it should be pointed out that the 
mutual indebtedness of the mills and the mines (open pits) and 
settlements with consumers of the finished product (nonpayments) 
are the principal reason for the mills' stoppages because of the 
lack of coal, and they are affecting the mills' preparation for 
operation in the winter of 1993-1994. 
  The main production indicators in coal concentration are 
cited in the table:

briquets 


  The principal reason for nonfulfillment of the plan to turn 
out graded coals is that insufficient quantities of coal were 
delivered for processing because the extraction plan was not 
fulfilled. There was a shortage of railcars to transport the 
coal for concentration because rail tariffs were not paid and 
customers refused to pay in advance. For these reasons, only 
eight of the 26 associations met their target for graded coal; 
the "Borodinskiy" Open Pit and the Krasnoyarskugol" Association 
practically discontinued turning it out because of the lack of 
contracts with customers. 
  The "Rostovugol" and "Gukovugol" PO [production 
associations] 
and the "Obukhovskaya" AO [Joint-Stock Company] failed 
completely to turn out graded anthracite because of the mines' 
production recession, although this grade is in demand. 
<H5>  1.3. The Shipment of Coal </H5>
  In the January-August period, the coal shipment plan for the 
coal industry as a whole was fulfilled by 100.2 percent, with 
400,000 metric tons above the plan being shipped. However, the 
situation sharply deteriorated in August, and the plan was 
underfulfilled by 230,000 metric tons, including all the 
principal coals. The quantity actually shipped over the 8-month 
period decreased by 27.5 million metric tons compared with the 
same period in 1992. 
  The main reason for the unsatisfactory work in August and 
the 
decrease in the volume of coal shipped, compared with 1992, is 
nonfulfullment of the coal extraction plan in August, a decrease 
of 21.9 million metric tons in the amount of coal extracted 
compared with the same period in 1992, and MPS [RF Ministry of 
Railways] railroads' restriction of coal amounts in coal 
enterprises' applications because they are constantly in debt 
for transportation fees. In addition, the decrease in shipment 
volumes has been affected by the increased railroad tariffs 
beginning 1 August 1993, 2.2 times higher than those in effect 
since 1 April 1993. 
<H6>  2. Coal Sales </H6>
  Coal is being delivered this year under more difficult 
conditions than in 1992; this is mainly because of coal industry 
enterprises' continuously deteriorating financial condition. 
First of all, the higher prices for coal, as well as the rise in 
railroad tariffs, have led to a sharp increase in customer 
indebtedness: it increased by 3.5 times as much in the 
July-August period, reaching 307 billion rubles [R] as of 1 
September 1993, according to current data. Secondly, the coal 
enterprises are delaying payment of freight charges. As of 1 
September 1993, the debt to the railroads was in excess of R153 
billion, including R102 billion to the Kemerovo Railroad, which 
led to a cutback in the supply of railcars for coal shipment. 
The poor competitiveness of the Kizelovskiy, Bogoslovksiy, and 
Podmoskovniy coals, compared with gas, is having an effect on 
deliveries as well. 
  As a result, the total volume of coal deliveries in July and 
August decreased by 22.5 percent compared with the first 6 
months of the year, as shown by the following data:

*Deliveries in Russia 


<H6>  Coal Machinebuilding </H6>
  3.1. Commodity production valued at R30.6 billion, which is 
68.4 percent of the planned output, was turned out by coal 
machinebuilding plants over the 8 months in 1993. As a result, 
products valued at R14.1 billion were not delivered. Compared 
with the same period last year, the volume of commodity 
production decreased by an average 32.2 percent. Production of 
the principal output is shown by the following data:

  Nonfulfillment of the plan and the decrease in production 
volume stem principally from the substantial cutback in the work 
force (by 3,698 employees or by 11.4 percent) and the insolvency 
of enterprises, which make it difficult to provide materials and 
component parts. 
<H6>  4. Capital Construction </H6>
  4.1 According to the startup program for 1993, the level at 
which capital investments were put into use for the annual 
volume as a whole was 25.6 percent and 31.6 percent for 
construction and installation work over the 8-month period, 
including 37.4 percent and 45.3 percent, respectively, at mines; 
19.6 percent and 25.9 percent at open pits; 25.9 percent and 
31.8 percent at coal processing facilities; 21.9 percent and 
26.7 percent at preschool institutions; 21.4 percent and 29.7 
percent at schools; and 15.6 percent and 25.5 percent at 
hospitals. Some 262,100 square meters of housing, including the 
proportion for individuals and ZhSK [Housing Construction 
Cooperatives], or 19.3 percent of the annual volume, were put 
into use. 
  4.2 The major facilities not put into use during the 8-month 
period: 
  --capacities to extract coal at the "Bachatskiy" Pit (2 
million metric tons in the "Kuzbassrazrezugol" Production 
Association), the "Taldinskiy" Pit (500,000 metric tons in the 
"Kuzbassshakhtostroy" Production Association), and the 
"Tyulganskiy" Pit (400,000 metric tons in the "Bashkirugol" 
Production Association); 
  --three kindergartens for 610 children (the 
"Kuzbassrazrezugol," "Kuzbassshakhtostroy," and "Sakhalinugol" 
production associations); and 
  --a 440-bed hospital complex with a polyclinic to 
accommodate 
1,000 visits (the "Leninskugol" Production Association). 
  4.3 The main reason for the extremely unsatisfactory 
situation in capital construction, as in the sector as a whole, 
is the financial crisis. As of 1 September 1993, the budget debt 
was R353.3 billion, including R86.3 billion for production 
development and R40.3 billion for TsKV [centrally convertible 
currency] financing. In August, the "Rosugol" Company, jointly 
with the Department of Coal Industry and representatives of the 
sector's construction organizations, reviewed the progress of 
construction starts and made appropriate decisions. 
<H6>  5. Economic Indicators </H6>
  5.1 The commodity production turned out over the 8-month 
period is valued at R793.6 billion in enterprises' comparable 
wholesale prices, which is 9.7 percent less than the same period 
last year. 
  5.2 The output of commodity production per employee was 
R1.3791 million, a decrease of 9.4 percent from 1992. 
  5.3 The average number of officially listed employees 
engaged 
directly in industrial production in the January-August period 
was 575,400, a decrease of 2,343 persons from 1992. There has 
been a steady outflow of personnel from coal enterprises since 
May. This is because of the unsatisfactory working conditions 
and the wage level, as well as seasonal fluctuations throughout 
the year. 

<FIG ID=FBIS-USR-026-75A>           Number of PPP [Workers Directly Engaged in Industrial Production] in 1993 </FIG>





    5.4 The wage of a worker in the coal industry in July 1993 
was R109,349, an increase of R25,694, or 30.7 percent, over June 
1993. The largest increases were in the production associations 
"Sakhalinugol" (171.9 percent), "Kizelugol" (162.5 percent), 
"Rostovugol" (161.6 percent), "Vostsibugol" (156.5 percent), 
"Primorskugol" (154.1 percent), and "Vorkutaugol" (150.7 
percent), and the smallest increases were in the production 
associations "Gukovugol" (106.7 percent), "Tulaugol" (108.9 
percent), and "Yakutugol" (111.5 percent). This wide fluctuation 
in the wage increase in July 1993 stems from the different 
procedure for calculating wages (taking wages into account with 
and without indexing to measure the rise in consumer prices in 
the second quarter of 1993) because of the delay in transferring 
budget funds for implementation of the sectorial wage agreement. 
  Compared with the same period last year, the average monthly 
wage of a worker in the industry over 7 months in 1993 increased 
by 7.6 times as much, reaching R66,354. The rate of the wage 
increase ranges from 652.8 percent in the "Leninskugol" 
Association to 1,001.8 percent in the "Severovostokugol" 
Association. 
  In June 1993, the wage of a worker in the coal industry was 
R88,529, which is R35,727 (40.4 percent) lower than the wage in 
the petroleum industry, R55,270 (62.4 percent) lower than the 
wage in the gas industry, and R2,711 (3.1 percent) lower than 
the wage in nonferrous metallurgy. In its wage level, the coal 
industry held fourth place in June (instead of third place in 
May), since in other sectors it had risen at a faster rate. The 
electric power engineering industry (with a wage of R87,921 in 
June) came close to the coal industry because of this. 
  In the first half of the year, the rate of increase in the 
average wage of coal industry employees was the highest (708 
percent) among the basic sectors of industry and industry as a 
whole in Russia (865.9 percent). 
  5.5. The production cost of 1 metric ton of coal from 
January 
to July 1993 was R3,021.58, which is R219.27 lower than the plan 
and R2,670.29 higher than in 1992. The increase in production 
cost over 1992 stems from the increase in the wage 
fund--R748.35--and the rise in prices and rates for material 
outlays--R921.86. 
  The funds saved for all extraction added up to R35.94 
billion. 
  5.6 As of 1 September 1993, the credit indebtedness of coal 
industry enterprises amounted to R370.9 billion and the debt of 
buyers and clients (the incurred debt) was R426.8 billion. In 
August, as a result of the higher prices for coal products, the 
steady inflationary excess of credit debt was abruptly replaced 
by an excess of incurred debt. 
<H6>  6. Shareholding and Privatization </H6>
  In conformity with the President's Edict No. 1702 of 30 
December 1992, 54 coal industry associations and enterprises are 
due to be changed into open-type joint-stock companies. 
  Two associations ("Gukovugol" and the "Kuznetskugol" 
Concern) 
and 21 enterprises, including eight mines, two open pits, two OF 
[concentration mills], four machinery plants, and two 
mine-building combines were changed into joint-stock companies. 
  In the January-August period, the Central Working Commission 
on Privatization of the RF MInistry of Fuel and Energy reviewed 
materials on 32 associations and enterprises and 36 directives 
were issued by the RF Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property]. As of 1 September 1993, 82 
directives were issued in the coal industry on the creation of 
joint-stock companies, 40 of them by the Goskomimushchestvo. 
  As of 1 September 1993, in the associations and enterprises 
listed in Supplements 1 to 4 of the Russian President's Edict 
No. 1702 of 30 December 1992, the following coal mining 
enterprises and machinebuilding plants were changed into 
joint-stock companies and founding documents were approved for 
them: "Kuzbassrazrezugol," "Vorkutaugol," "Sibantratsit," 
"Krasnoyarskugol," and "Rostovugol," and the Kopeyskiy, 
Shakhtinskiy, Kamenskiy, Aleksandrovskiy, and Istrinskiy 
("Uglemash") machinebuilding plants. 
  Documents for approval of the joint-stock companies of the 
Skuratovskiy, Skopinskiy, and Atkarskiy machinebuilding plants, 
the "Leningradslanets" Association, and the 
"Mosbassshakhtostroy" Combine are now in the RF 
Goskomimushchestvo for its consideration. 
  Materials on changing the production associations 
"Dalvostugol," "Tulaugol," "Kizelugol," "Sakhalinugol," 
"Bashkirugol," and "Belovougol"; the "Leninskugol," 
"Kiselevugol," and "Prokopyevskugol" associations; the 
"Severokuzbassugol" and "Khakasugol" concerns; the 
"Giprouglemash" Institute; and the "Shakter" Rest Home into 
joint-stock companies have been reviewed in the Central Working 
Commission and are being prepared for transmittal to the RF 
Goskomimushchestvo. 
  Materials on the "Vakhrushevugol" Association have been 
transferred to the working group for its consideration. 
  Materials on the "Vostsibugol" Production Association and 
the 
"Katekuglestroy" Combine are being prepared for the working 
group's review. 
  In accordance with the schedule outlined, it is expected 
that 
examination of the materials on changing the enterprises 
stipulated by the RF President's Decree No. 1702 of 30 December 
1992 into joint-stock companies and their submission to the RF 
Ministry of Fuel and Energy will be completed for the most part 
in the third quarter of this year. 
<H6>  7. Conclusions </H6>
  7.1. The recession continues in coal mining, the production 
volumes at coal machinebuilding plants, and in capital 
construction. 
  These are the principal reasons: 
  --decline in the effective demand for coal products because 
of coal customers' lack of funds and the increased prices for 
coal; 
  --the shortage of funds to obtain materials and equipment in 
the quantities needed; and 
  --delays in receiving the means of state support. 
  7.2 Introduction of free prices for coal beginning on 1 July 
1993 with an increase in transportation rates at the same time 
has had a negative effect on the level of coal deliveries and 
its accumulation by customers before the fall and winter period 
of 1993-1994.

01-12/19 of 10 January 1994: "Rules for the Determination of the 
Country of Origin of Goods"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Rules for the Determination of the Country of Origin of 
Goods, Approved by Resolution of the Council of the Heads of the 
Governments of the Commonwealth of Independent States on the 
Rules for the Determination of the Country of Origin of Goods of 
24 September 1993 </H3>
  These Rules are in effect in relation to goods that 
originate 
from the member nations of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States (CIS) and circulate in trade among those nations. 
  For the purposes of these Rules: 
  a) the term "member nations of the CIS" is understood to be 
nations that are members of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States who have signed the Agreement on Collaboration in the 
Sphere of Foreign Economic Activity (15 May 1992, Tashkent); 
  b) the term "country of origin of goods" signifies a nation 
that is a member of the CIS in which a good was manufactured 
entirely or was subject to sufficient processing. The cumulative 
principle of origin may be employed when applying the criterion 
of sufficient processing, that is, those nations are considered 
to be a whole when there is consecutive processing of a good in 
member nations of the CIS; 
  c) the term "criterion of sufficient processing" signifies a 
criterion, in accordance with which a good that two or more 
countries have taken part in producing is considered to 
originate from the country in which it was subject to the final 
substantial processing sufficient to impart its characteristic 
properties to it; 
  d) the term "customs control" signifies the aggregate of 
measures performed by national customs bodies for the purpose of 
ensuring the observance of national legislation in customs 
matters, as well as national legislation and international 
treaties whose monitoring is entrusted to customs bodies; 
  e) the term "goods" signifies any movable property, 
including 
thermal, electrical and other types of energy, that is moved 
across a customs border; 
  f) the term "goods list" signifies the Goods List of Foreign 
Economic Activity (TN VED) based on the Coordinated System of 
Describing and Coding Goods and Combined Tariff-Statistical List 
of the European Community that is employed in the member nations 
of the CIS. 
  The procedure for determining the country of origin of goods 
imported onto the customs territory of the member nations of the 
CIS from third countries and shipped to third countries from 
those nations is regulated by the national legislation of the 
member nations of the CIS. 
  1. A nation where a good was produced entirely or subjected 
to sufficient processing is considered to be the country of 
origin. 
  2. The following goods are considered to have been produced 
entirely in a given country: 
  a) minerals extracted from its territory or territorial 
waters, continental shelf and seas, if the country has the 
exclusive right to the development of those mineral resources; 
  b) plant products cultivated and harvested on its territory; 
  c) live animals bred and grown in it; 
  d) products obtained in that country from animals bred in 
it; 
  e) products of the hunting, fishing and sea trades produced 
in it; 
  f) products of sea trades extracted and/or produced in the 
world's oceans by the vessels of that country or vessels leased 
(chartered) by it; 
  g) secondary raw materials and by-products that are the 
result of production and other operations performed in that 
country; 
  h) the products of high technology obtained in outer space 
on 
spacecraft that belong to the given country or are leased by it; 
  i) goods produced in a given country exclusively from the 
products mentioned in subclauses a--h of Paragraph 2. 
  3. When two or more countries participate in the production 
of a good, the origin of the good is determined in accordance 
with the criterion of "sufficient processing." 
  4. The criterion of "sufficient processing" may be 
expressed: 
  a) by a rule requiring changes in the tariff category of the 
corresponding goods list, with a list of exceptions[.sup]1[/]; 
  b) by a list of the production or technological processes 
that are sufficient or insufficient for the good to be 
considered as originating from the country where those processes 
took place; 
  c) by a rule of ad valorem share, where the 
percentage share of the value of the materials used or added 
value reaches a set limit in the price of the ex plant price of 
the good being supplied. 
  5. In the event that the criteria for the origin of a good 
are not specially stipulated in relation to specific goods or a 
specific country (or countries), a general rule is applied, in 
accordance with which a good is considered to have been 
subjected to sufficient processing if a change in the good entry 
(classification code of the good) according to the Goods List at 
the level of any of the first four marks occurred. 
  6. In the event that the criterion of "sufficient 
processing" 
is expressed through an ad valorem share, the value 
indicators are computed: 
  a) for imported materials: according to the customs value, 
that is, the value subject to customs charges on import (based 
on the CIF) or, in the event that their origin is unknown, 
according to the stipulated price of first sale on the territory 
of the country of production; 
  b) for finished products: at the ex plant price or export 
price of the seller. 
  7. Items in dismantled or unassembled form that are 
delivered 
in several lots, where their shipment in one lot[.sup]2[/] is 
not possible under production or transport conditions, should be 
considered, according to the wishes of the importer, as a 
unified item from the standpoint of determining the 
origin[.sup]3[/]. 
  8. The origin of thermal and electrical energy, machinery, 
equipment and tooling used in the production of goods is not 
taken into account for the purposes of determining their origin. 
  9. A good is considered to originate from the country of 
export only in the event that the good does not conform to the 
criteria of origin stipulated by these Rules and the other 
conditions, but is procured directly from an enterprise or firm 
duly registered in the country of export and is imported via 
direct shipment from that country to the country of import. 
  Goods that are transported across the territory of one or 
several countries as a consequence of geographical, transport, 
technical or economic reasons, as well as in their temporary 
import or storage on the territory of those conditions, also 
meet the requirement for direct shipment provided that the goods 
are at all times under the customs control of the transit 
country. 
  Goods that are procured by an importer at exhibitions or 
fairs also meet the rules for direct shipment, provided that 
those goods are not used for purposes other than those exhibited 
after shipment to the exhibition or fair, and remain under 
customs control during the exhibition or fair. 
  10. The submission of a declaration-certificate 
(hereinafter, 
a certificate) of the origin of a good to the customs bodies of 
the country of import is necessary in order to attest the origin 
of a good in a given member nation of the CIS. 
  11. The certificate of origin is issued, in the export of 
goods from member nations of the CIS, by bodies of the country 
of origin of the good authorized to do so in accordance with 
national legislation. 
  The member nations of the CIS exchange samples of the seals 
of bodies and the signatures of persons authorized to attest 
certificates. Certificates are considered to be invalid without 
submission of these samples, and the preferences stipulated by 
agreements on the trade regime do not extend to the goods. 
  12. A certificate should contain the following essential 
information about the good for which it is issued: 
  a) the name and address of the exporter; 
  b) the name and address of the importer; 
  c) the means of transport and the routing (as far as is 
known); 
  d) the quantity of pieces and the type of packing, and a 
description of th good containing all of the information 
necessary for identification of the good; 
  e) the gross and net weight.[.sup]4[/] 
  13. The certificate of origin should unequivocably testify 
to 
the fact that the given good originates from the corresponding 
country, that is, it should contain: 
  a) the written declaration of the exporter that the good 
meets the appropriate criterion of origin; 
  b) written attestation of the authorized body that issued 
the 
certificate that the information submitted by the exporter in 
the certificate corresponds to reality. 
  14. The certificate of origin is submitted to customs bodies 
in typewritten form, without corrections, in the Russian 
language. 
  15. The certificate of origin is submitted together with the 
freight customs declaration and other documentation necessary 
for the performance of customs clearance. 
  16. A officially attested duplicate (copy) of a certificate 
of origin is accepted in the event of its loss. 
  17. The exporter may declare the country of origin of a good 
in an invoice, or other accompanying documents attached to the 
good, to attest to the origin of small lots of goods (values of 
up to 5,000 dollars U.S.). 
  18. In the event doubts arise regarding the validity of a 
certificate of origin or the information contained in it, the 
customs bodies may appeal to the authorized organizations that 
attested the certificate or to other authorized bodies of the 
country indicated as the country of origin of the goods with a 
well-founded request to report additional or clarifying 
information. 
  19. A good is not considered to originate from a given 
country until suitable confirmation of the origin or the 
requested information is furnished. 
  20. The failure to submit a properly completed certificate 
of 
origin or information on origin, as a general rule, is not 
grounds not to permit the good to pass. 
  Customs may refuse passage only in the presence of 
sufficient 
grounds to assume that ths freight is originating from a country 
that is not subject to passage into the country of import in 
accordance with international agreements prevailing for that 
nation, and/or its national legislation. 
  Goods whose origin has not been reliably established are 
permitted into the country of import, with a regard for the 
provisions of the second paragraph of this clause, with the 
payment of customs duties at the maximum customs tariff rate of 
the country of import. 
  21. Most favored status or a preferential status may be 
applied (or restored) for the goods indicated in the third 
paragraph of clause 20 provided suitable attestation is received 
on their origin no later than one year after the shipment 
(release) of the goods. 
Footnotes 
  1. The list of exceptions could contain: 
  a) a list of the production or technological operations 
that, 
even though leading to a change in the tariff category, are not 
considered a sign of sufficient processing or are considered 
such only with the observance of certain conditions; 
  b) a list of the production or technological operations 
that, 
even though they do not lead to changes in the tariff category, 
are considered to be a sign of sufficient processing with the 
observance of certain conditions. The conditions mentioned in 
subclauses a and b may pertain both to operations that are 
performed with a good and to the rule of the ad 
valorem share. 
  2. This rule is also applied in those cases where a lot has 
been broken up into several by mistake or by virtue of incorrect 
addressing. 
  3. The conditions for the application of this rule are: 
  --the advance notification of import customs of the breakup 
of a dismantled or unassembled good into several lots with an 
indication of the reasons for the breakup, the detailed 
specification of each lot as referenced to the TN VED, the value 
and the country of origin of the goods that make up that lot; 
  --the delivery of all lots from one country or one exporter; 
  --the entry of all lots through the same customs office; 
  --the delivery of all lots of goods within a time period 
that 
does not exceed six months from the date of the first shipment. 
  2. These values may be replaced with others, such as the 
quantity of units or the volume, when the weight of the good 
varies substantially in transporting or when those units are 
employed in standard fashion in relation to that type of product.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Nesvizhskiy: "Tallinn and Moscow Argue About </F>
the Border"] 
  [Text] Residents of Pechora Region obtaining Estonian 
passports 
  Debates about state ownership of Pechora Region, transferred 
in 1944 to the RSFSR [Russian Soviet Federative Socialist 
Republic], have been going on since the proclamation of 
independence by neighboring Estonia. Not recognizing "Stalinist" 
boundaries, the Estonian side continues to refer to "the only 
internationally recognized document"--the Tartu Peace Treaty of 
1920, in accordance with which Pechora Region was part of 
Estonia. Russia, naturally, prefers to proceed from current 
administrative borders, gradually transforming them into state 
borders, and refers to the will of the current population of the 
region, renewed by 90 percent in recent years. 
  For Russia today it is the state border here, while Estonia 
stubbornly adheres to the term "control line" with regard to it, 
at the same time the boundary designation remains in the stage 
of "informal transparency." "The border essentially exists for 
the transportation flow, and if I should want to by-pass the 
border check point, I can enter Estonia without any 
difficulties," Vitaliy Kustov, deputy chief of administration of 
Pechora Region, admitted to the SEGODNYA correspondent in the 
course of an interview. 
  The problem lies not so much in the shortage of border 
guards 
(of which, as commonly known, there is an abundance in Russia) 
as in the complicated nature of the present-day border which is 
yet to be demarcated. A couple of weeks ago Estonian border 
guards detained several Russian loggers on territory which they 
sincerely believed to be Estonian. Some 850 meters of a road 
linking the Estonian villages of Vyarsk and Sats belong to 
Russia, which established two check points there with two armed 
guards at each one, while the road home from the Russian island 
of Kolpino lies through Estonian territory. During summer 
exchanges of "detained foreigners," consisting of mushroom 
pickers and children who wandered into the neighboring country, 
are conducted by border guards at the check points. 
  After transfer of the region to RSFSR a major part of the 
indigenous population (before the war there was approximately an 
equal number of Russians and Estonians in Pechora) moved to 
Estonia. Those left were mainly old people with children or 
relatives in Estonia. 
  By contrast with the northern segment of the border, where 
residents of Narva and Ivangorod on the border received passes, 
there is nothing like that in Pechora and many found themselves 
in a difficult situation. A solution was swiftly suggested "from 
the other side": in accordance with Estonian law residents of 
the republic born prior to 1940 (within the old borders that 
included Pechora Region) as well as their descendants are 
Estonian citizens and eligible to receive an Estonian passport. 
A special Pechora branch of the Department of Estonian 
Citizenship was opened in the border Estonian village of Vyarsk, 
where residents of the region are issued Estonian passports. 
According to Vitaliy Kustov around 1,000 Pechora Region 
residents, both Estonians and Russians, have already obtained 
them. It is, however, impossible to cite an exact figure since 
there is no dual citizenship treaty between Russia and Estonia 
and holders of the passport with three lions prefer not to 
advertise their foreign document. Estonians in turn also refuse 
to submit lists of their citizens in Pechora. 
  As reported by Juri Vaidla, chief of "the Department of 
Citizenship of the Pechora Region of Estonia," to a SEGODNYA 
correspondent, the lists are so highly classified that even the 
authorities cannot always gain access to them: "We fear 
repressions against those people in Pechora, and the lists may 
be obtained by only one person in Tallinn--the minister of 
internal affairs of Estonia." The same may be heard from others 
as well. Citizens receive Estonian passports as a matter of 
course thanks to the "wise" policy of Pechora authorities which 
do not allow even those to go abroad whom the Estonians are 
prepared to admit. Estonian entry visas for some reason are 
specifically checked by our side (for the Estonians it is 
sufficient for a passport to show Pechora Region as the 
birthplace). The latest innovation of the local administration 
differs little from the previous ones. The Pechora Railway 
Station, where those wishing to visit their neighbors are 
required to disembark in accordance with decree No. 48 of the 
regional administration, has been declared a control zone. 
Russian NTV television company personnel were not admitted there 
with the explanation that their Tallinn colleagues had spent two 
hours in a militia station for attempting to disembark at the 
railway station with a television camera. 
  "Pechora leadership is aiming to cut itself off from the 
neighbors with a stone wall"--says a Russian woman from the 
island of Kolpino, who arrived in Vyarsk for a passport. "We are 
simply unable to travel to St. Petersburg each time for a visa." 
  Meanwhile Pechora Region land is now being claimed not only 
by Pechora residents: on the eve of a new round of 
Russo-Estonian negotiations there was a meeting of "owners of 
land in Pechora Region" in Vyarsk last Saturday. In accordance 
with Estonian laws all property confiscated in the years of 
Soviet power must be returned to them. 
  "If Russia is not prepared to recognize our jurisdiction 
over 
Pechora, let it at least recognize the rights of the heirs," 
Jaak Herodes, deputy of the State Assembly of Estonia, declared. 
In any case the issue concerning return of property to the heirs 
will be placed on the agenda of Russo-Estonian negotiations in 
the very near future. We do not divide by nationality--Estonian, 
Russian, or Jew: all these people are citizens of Estonia and it 
is obliged to protect their rights." He believes that issuance 
of Estonian passports will help residents of Pechora Region to 
avoid problems even if only with the Estonian side. 
  Many of his colleagues, however, have a more radical view: 
Ein Tarto, deputy of the State Assembly of Estonia from the 
ruling Isamaa [Fatherland] coalition party, who arrived in 
Vyarsk, is confident that Russia will sooner or later return 
Pechora Region to the republic. Judging by everything the 
growing number of Estonian citizens in the disputed region may 
become a trump card for Tallinn. 
  If Estonia refuses to participate in the determination of a 
new border, the Russian side will designate the border in a 
unilateral manner. But according to Russian law a state border 
is established on the basis of bilateral agreements, and 
Estonia, armed with the Tartu Treaty of 1920, will hardly agree 
to sign a new one. The territorial dispute promises to be 
endless.

<F P=106> [Article by Suren Zolyan, deputy of Supreme Council of the </F>
republic of Armenia: "What Is Good for Russia Is Not Necessarily 
Acceptable for All"] 
  [Text] Besides integration "in the Moscow manner" 
there are other forms of interaction. 
  A study of the post-Soviet space recently made by Andranik 
Migranyan in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA is based on a clearly expressed 
pragmatic concept defining real geopolitical interests of the 
current moment as well as interests that are not common but 
primarily Russian. Naturally, with such an approach the specific 
concept of "the near abroad" may be determined only with 
application to Russia. At the same time Migranyan's study is 
dominated by thinking characteristic of contemporary Russian 
political scientists: whatever is good for Russia is good for 
all, and Russia is the CIS. It is possible that this sense of 
succession and responsibility prevailed over a falsely conceived 
imperial guilt complex with political escapism prompted by it. 
But what if Russian interests become contrary to the interests 
of its partners, which, although Migranyan does take into 
account, he does not accept as being of equal importance? The 
same problem may have another aspect if one proceeds not from an 
absolutization of the interests of a certain state but from the 
possible long-range prospects of the CIS. 
  But who is holder of CIS interests? Can there be 
Commonwealth 
interests different from the interests of each of the states 
forming it? Finally, does the CIS actually exist? Is that a 
legal form for the restoration of something akin to the Russian 
empire, or a channel through which former Soviet republics 
continue to "milk" Russia? 
  Despite the contradictory nature of these publicist rather 
than political approaches they are similar in that they 
interpret the CIS as a certain extension of Russia. Therefore 
those "integrative processes" of which Migranyan speaks, may be 
conditioned only by its political will backed up with numerous 
control levers--from economic to military ones. In that form the 
CIS might develop through the purposeful weakening of all 
partners with a dominant Russia. It is necessary to remember 
that it was only military failure and anticipation of Russian 
aid that brought Georgia and Azerbaijan into the Commonwealth, 
and domestic problems made Ukraine more loyal. This, however, 
makes Russia itself weaker forcing it to keep those who are 
drowning "afloat" and interdicting attempts to involve "third 
parties." Will Russia have sufficient strength to act as the 
donor, creator of conflicts with subsequent peacemaking, 
supporter of regimes loyal to it, while also counteracting 
different blocs, particularly since CIS members are 
simultaneously members of other unions (the Black Sea Economic 
Organization, the Islamic Conference, the Turkic Conference)? 
Currently it is clear that the CIS will not become either a form 
for restoration of the Soviet Union, nor anything like the 
Sakharov model of a commonwealth of freely unified free peoples. 
With the weakening of Russia the CIS may immediately 
disintegrate or return to its 1992 state when relations between 
its partners were reminiscent of scenes in the lodging house 
from the stage play called "At the Bottom." 
  It is, however, possible to view the concept at the basis of 
the CIS not primarily as a Russian one. Today the CIS is rather 
a club of presidents who for the most part are defending the 
interests of the elite they represent and supporting integration 
only to the degree agreeable to that elite. Out of the numerous 
declarations on the creation of various kinds of "unified spaces 
and zones" not a single one was ever created. But there is a 
unified psychological space, coinciding with boundaries of the 
former USSR, which does not depend on any decisions at CIS 
summit meetings and is not politically structured--it is a space 
common to all problems, where everyone, by virtue of his 
possibilities, resolves similar survival tasks. "The holders of 
CIS interests" are not only the national minorities and citizens 
who remained outside the borders of their national states. The 
small businessman-speculator negotiating at the airport with a 
minor bribe-taking customs official, a major industrialist 
lobbying the government for credit, the president signing 
another edict on measures for the social protection of the 
population, and the old woman begging for alms--all of that is 
devoid of any national features and is not delineated by current 
state borders. It is impossible to get away from this unified 
space of common crises, inasmuch as beyond the very first real 
foreign border post the criteria are completely different. 
  At the same time prospects for the realistic development of 
the CIS lie not in political intrigues and pressure on weak 
partners, but in the appearance of forces, which for various 
reasons are interested in the development of the CIS. Thus far 
only the communists, who do not acquire any complexes resulting 
from accusations of restorative tendencies, are openly appearing 
as a transnational force, which discredits the very idea of 
cooperation. An alliance between nationalist movements, which in 
a paradoxical manner are unified by their opposition to 
transnational structures, is planned even though that is not 
advertised. But centrist and democratic forces, retaining 
loyalty to national sovereignty, are avoiding any organizational 
forms of cooperation. The interparliamentary assembly, which 
today exists more as an appendage to presidential conferences 
and not as a realistically operating political organ, could 
become such a form. Parliaments merely ratify decisions adopted 
at the presidential level, while their multiparty structure may 
serve as an effective feedback mechanism. The CIS 
interparliamentary assembly could assume a form close to the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council (which includes 
not only groups of deputies from individual countries but 
interstate factions as well), whose decisions, formally 
considered as recommendations, become the defining factors for 
interstate executive structures. Even with such a 
transformation, however, an interparliamentary assembly must be 
supplemented with a nongovernmental formation--a permanently 
operating forum representing regional cultural and ethnic 
minorities incapable of negotiating parliamentary selection 
procedures. 
  Many problems may be eliminated if a regional approach, 
already adopted by the European Community and the European 
Council (known as "Europe of regions"), gains an upper hand. It 
assumes that Europe consists not just of independent states, but 
also of unified, historically formed regions, whose borders do 
not always coincide with state and ethnic boundaries. Expansion 
in the authority of local units of self-government and 
autonomies, transborder cooperation, and even interstate 
management through regional parliaments composed of 
representatives of local authorities in the neighboring 
states--all of these real integrated models have already proven 
their effectiveness. But the presently existing CIS structures 
do not promote integration and lead to one-sided, and therefore 
temporary domination by Russia. It is undoubtedly difficult to 
create political and civil institutions which would be capable 
of correcting decisions made by a narrow circle of individuals 
in power. But then the policy of Russia toward the near abroad, 
whose instability at present compels even its most loyal 
partners to remain on guard, will lose its quality of 
extemporaneous operations by appartchiks. 
  Alternative approaches are particularly important in 
analyzing the situation in the Caucasus. In the study by 
Andranik Migranyan the Caucasus occupies a special place as a 
model of integrative processes. He proceeds from the political 
reality with sovereign Russia, Belarus, and Armenia with their 
presidents, borders and flags. The disintegration of the Soviet 
Union, however, goes on and its effects continue to be felt even 
in the most independent and sovereign Russia. It periodically 
finds itself on the verge of civil war. Its troops engage in 
battle along the Tajik border but do not have the right to enter 
the territory of Chechen. The position of others, particularly 
of the Transcaucasian states, whose actually controlled 
territories differ significantly from the 
national-administrative borders, is even more problematical. 
  Migranyan overcomes one conditionality by viewing Northern 
Caucasus and Transcaucasia as "a unified geopolitical zone in 
which similar processes are taking place." But stops himself, 
concluding that "Caucasus represents a cultural, religious, and 
ethnic mosaic and, beyond the control of the great powers 
bordering it, the people of that region, by virtue of their 
cultural and historical characteristics, do not wish to or 
cannot carry out full integration. The creation of independent 
states in the Caucasus, however, is also impossible outside of 
the sphere of influence of one of the great powers adjoining the 
region due to the ethnic composition of the population, the 
small size of such states, and the limited economic potential 
and geopolitical isolation." Therefore the solution proposed by 
Migranyan fails to account for the peculiarities of the region, 
but is adjusted to fit preexisting experience that has not 
justified itself: "In order to achieve stability and peace in 
that region Russia should establish itself as the guarantor of 
national and territorial autonomy of these formations. Just the 
observance of the rights of small minorities and cultural 
communities, guaranteed by Russia, must allow Russian 
authorities to guarantee and ensure territorial integrity of 
these new states. Considering the continued attachment of the 
Caucasus specifically to Russia, integration of a federalized 
Caucasian space with the Russian Federation within the CIS 
framework appears highly possible." All of that, however, was in 
the twenties. In the inevitably callous language of practical 
politics that means a return to the system of microempires, 
while the "integrating" role of Russia will boil down to 
performance of the functions of a policeman watching to make 
certain that the seniors (states-republics) do not harm the 
juniors (autonomies and minorities), and juniors listen to the 
seniors. In reality this means that Russia will be constantly 
drawn into conflicts either on one or the other side, which in 
the end will lead to its total loss of credibility in the region 
and then its final withdrawal, which will be welcomed both by 
the seniors and the juniors (those who manage to survive). I 
think that Andranik Migranyan is somewhat exaggerating the 
degree of "attachment of the Caucasus specifically to Russia." 
Russian tanks and bullets provide a rather swift cure for such 
sentiments. To consider that "the overthrow of the 
administrations of Gamsakhurdia and Elchibey is vivid evidence 
of the fact that they lost the support of the population when 
consequences of a rift with Russia became clear," indicates an 
unwillingness to analyze universally known factors. The reason 
for their downfall was certainly not national indignation with 
an anti-Russian policy of these "administrations," but rather 
obvious political manipulation. 
  Andranik Migranyan considers that "the creation of 
independent states in the Caucasus is impossible outside the 
sphere of influence of one of the great powers adjoining the 
region." Today, however, there is the political realization of 
the existing "cultural, religious, and ethnic mosaic." The 
Caucasus is a unified, even though a heterogeneous, finely 
balanced system of historically formed regions. That equilibrium 
is very easily disrupted: it is sufficient to intensify one of 
the elements from the outside. That is exactly the way the 
neighboring powers acted for centuries. Such a policy may pursue 
a variety of goals, with the exception of one--establishment of 
peace and stability in the region. 
  The proposed federalization is highly reminiscent of 
Bolshevik experience with the Transcaucasian Federation which 
included Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan with the autonomous 
republics, oblasts, and even uezds contained in them. By virtue 
of historical peculiarities of the Caucasus, its real elements 
are not the three main nations--Azerbaijanis, Georgians, and 
Armenians, but historically formed mono and multiethnic regions. 
The natural geographic and linguistic boundaries promoted 
preservation of natural habitat regions which in the Middle Ages 
were politically established as semi-independent mini-states 
(gavars, beks, khanates, meliks) which could not be changed 
either by the systematically conducted unification (Russian 
authorities constantly changed the boundaries of gubernias and 
uezds), nor by the policy of the USSR aimed at consolidation of 
titular nations at the expense of minorities. Back in the 17th - 
18th centuries small Karabakh consisted of five practically 
independent principalities (meliks). Another example, of an 
integrated multi-ethnic region (most lamentably it is no longer 
such), consisted of Abkhazia. Anyone who has any knowledge of 
the Caucasus, will readily suggest this version. First of all 
the regional structure of the Caucasus is more stable than its 
mosaic-like ethnic boundaries, secondly it serves as a natural 
guarantee of the existence of minority nations. Consequently 
federalization of the Caucasus could be carried out proceeding 
from the reality of the regions. 
  By way of an example it is possible to cite the Swiss 
Confederation which is certainly not a confederation of Germans, 
French people, and Italians, but that of regions, cantons, and 
mini-states with their own parliaments, executive and judicial 
organs and a right to veto decisions of federal organs. The 
federation in the Caucasus would be not a system of ethnocratic 
states with certain autonomous features "guaranteed" by Russia 
but sovereign regions, possessing legitimate power and a certain 
form of representation in the CIS and international 
organizations. 
  The "intensification of disintegration processes" of which 
Migranyan is speaking, is a natural continuation of the collapse 
of the Soviet Union. But it is not understandable why that 
process must be labeled as an ongoing "de facto federalization 
of Georgia and Azerbaijan" which must still be consolidated de 
jure with the aid of Russia. Quite the contrary: the 
federalization of these states within the USSR system was 
consolidated de jure. The result is well known. It would be more 
accurate to call the actual process as regionalization of the 
Caucasus. The present struggle of Transcaucasian states for 
"territorial integrity" and "intensification of executive power" 
(idioms, designating dictatorship, suppression of minorities and 
disassembly of structures of local self-government) merely 
confirms the actual disintegration of the Caucasus into regions. 
Russia, supporting that struggle, is joining in the victorious 
war of the "administrations" against their own citizens who are 
of a foreign race or against dissidents. 
  The alleged inability of Caucasian nations to live together 
without the help of police is a myth. It is specifically the 
small size of elements comprising the ethnic system of the 
Caucasus that ensures a balance of power among them. The 
influence of Russia in the Caucasus can be stable and 
irreversible if it assumes the role of a guarantor ensuring 
peaceful creation of the final political map of the Caucasus. 
Russian military presence, particularly along the borders is 
permissible only as a restraining factor.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "Not All Have Resigned </F>
Themselves to the Success of Soviet Power: Paths of Development 
of the Presidency in Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Leonid Kravchuk gave three reasons for his decision 
not to be a candidate for the early presidential elections in 
June. First, the inopportune and inexpedient nature of 
presidential elections at a time when elections to the new 
parliament might not have been completed or when it would only 
just have been formed. Second, in Leonid Kravchuk's opinion, his 
participation in the elections would signify defense of the 
socioeconomic situation that has taken shape in Ukraine. And, 
finally, Leonid Kravchuk is unwilling to run because, were he to 
do so, the other candidates would focus attention not on the 
advancement of their programs of the development of the state 
but on proof of the incapability of Leonid Kravchuk. 
  The other event of the week was the consideration in 
parliament of the law on the election of the chairmen and 
deputies of the local soviets of all levels and revisions to the 
law adopted earlier on the elections for president of Ukraine. 
The latest documents have, in fact, opened the way to the 
restoration in Ukraine of soviet power in full, the difference 
being merely that the soviets are not now backed by a united 
Communist Party directing their work. Consequently, the new 
soviets, controlled by different political forces in different 
regions, could perfectly well under the conditions of the 
weakening of the central authority contribute to the further 
federalization of Ukraine. In addition, the revisions to the law 
on the elections for president were clearly made in the 
interests of candidates of the so-called power party for in 
accordance with the new law, for example, only a nominee for 
whom 50,000 signatures have been collected, of which no fewer 
than 1,000 signatures need to have been collected in two-thirds 
of the oblasts, may register as a candidate. Inasmuch as only 
voter collectives and political parties, which in Ukraine 
possess neither money nor sufficient influence, may nominate 
presidential candidates, only the organized power structures are 
capable of performing such work in support of their candidate. 
  President Leonid Kravchuk and the presidential structures 
retain several options for further action. For example, 
reconciling themselves to defeat and giving power to popularly 
elected soviets and their chairmen combining, in addition, the 
positions of chiefs of the local executives. It is this, it 
would seem, to which Leonid Kravchuk's refusal to run at the 
elections points. But Kravchuk himself made it understood in a 
subsequent interview with the BBC that he, not being a member of 
any party, could not be a party candidate but could, on the 
other hand, be nominated by a voters' assembly, which he could 
not prohibit from so doing. It is perfectly possible that Leonid 
Kravchuk's refusal statement was nothing more than an endeavor 
to test his popularity and provoke so-called letters from the 
working people, who would demand that Leonid Kravchuk "not 
abandon them at a difficult time for the country." Testifying in 
support of this supposition is the fact that the surprise 
decision was for the first time in the period since the election 
of the president in Ukraine criticized on official radio and 
television. 
  There are also other options, which are directly connected 
with the parliamentary elections, which are already planned. One 
of them--the passive-legitimate--is seeking the victory of 
supporters of the executive at the elections, forming a 
parliamentary majority, and adopting a clear policy of the 
building of a presidential-parliamentary republic. That this 
option is not being discounted is indicated by the numerous 
nominations of representatives of the executive and the 
presidential structures as candidates for people's deputy. 
  The second path may conditionally be called 
active-legitimate. Its essence consists of aborting the March 
parliamentary elections and, taking advantage of the 
unpopularity of the present Supreme Council, whose authority 
would be automatically extended, organizing an all-Ukraine 
referendum on confidence in parliament, winning it, scheduling 
new parliamentary elections, and canceling the presidential 
elections, giving as the reason for this a reluctance to create 
a power vacuum. The question of Leonid Kravchuk running or not 
running would in this case disappear automatically. 
  The presidential structures could only venture upon this 
option given the high popularity of Leonid Kravchuk, and this, 
as we all know, is lacking: The president's rating is 
approaching the zero mark. 
  But there remains to the presidential authorities one 
further 
scenario similar to the not entirely legitimate Russian 
scenario, when the president, after parliamentary elections 
which have not taken place, may without an all-Ukraine 
referendum terminate the authority of the unpopular present 
deputies, dissolve parliament, and set a date for new 
parliamentary elections, timing to coincide with them a 
referendum in support of his policy and, naturally, canceling 
the presidential elections. The high popularity of the president 
and a constructive program of reforms and an improvement in life 
which is attractive to the population and which could be 
presented for popular confirmation are needed for such a turn of 
events also. Kravchuk's team has neither. 
  Of course, that both parliamentary elections and 
presidential 
elections, at which the winners would be representatives of the 
reform forces, who would venture upon decisive actions and could 
confront the degradation of the country, will be held could be 
forecast also. But given the lack of coordination of action of 
such forces and given the fragmentation of the democratic camp, 
the main feature of the political struggle in Ukraine remains 
the fact that it leaves the economy practically untouched. The 
mass of the two groupings of the "power party" defending either 
soviet power or the presidency remains supporters of a slow 
version of reform of the economy. Only the liberals, few in 
number, the representatives and proteges of new capital and new 
owners and also the national democrats support a faster pace of 
market economic reform. The possibility of their creating a 
parliamentary majority in the event of elections being held is 
very, very problematical.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "Central Electoral Commission </F>
Feeling Sorry for the Voters--Preliminary Results Show 
Communists Fared Better Than Other Parties in the Election of 
People's Deputies"] 
  [Text] Ivan Yemets, chairman of the Central Electoral 
Commission for the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine, 
held a press conference in Kiev, at which he declared that one 
very important step in the preelection campaign had been 
completed--the registration of candidates. In his words, 5,833 
candidates were registered as of 2 March, a figure which cannot 
increase but only be reduced for a number of objective reasons. 
Yemets informed journalists that on the average across Ukraine, 
13 individuals were registered per district, although there is 
one district in Kiev in which 31 candidates have been nominated, 
and there are three districts in all of Ukraine in which just 
two persons each have been nominated. 
  Some 62.3 percent of all candidates were nominated by the 
voters, 26.7 percent--by labor collectives, and only 11 
percent--by political parties. Among the parties that have 
nominated candidates, the Communists are in the lead with 6.7 
percent. People's Rukh of Ukraine has 4.1 percent, the 
Socialists--3.1 percent, the Ukrainian Republicans--2.4 percent, 
the Liberals--1.4 percent, and the Democrats--1.3 percent. Ivan 
Yemets states that these data pertain to "pure" party 
candidates, while the actual number of party nominees is far 
greater, many candidates simply not desiring to link their names 
with unpopular parties. Representatives of 22 nationalities 
residing in Ukraine are registered as candidates for people's 
deputy of Ukraine. There are more Ukrainians than any other 
ethnic group--87 percent. Russians comprise 18.6 percent. Within 
the entire field of candidates, 24.6 percent are engineers or 
representatives of other technical specialties; 15.6 percent are 
employees of various backgrounds; 10.4 percent are lawyers; 8.5 
percent--economists; 6.3 percent--physicians; 7 
percent--agricultural workers; 3 percent--journalists; 2.2 
percent--military servicemen. With respect to academic 
qualifications, 98.4 percent of the candidates have higher 
education, secondary, or secondary specialized education; 89.6 
percent have attained the higher level of education. Of this 
number, 6.8 percent are academicians and corresponding members, 
and about 3 percent are doctors of science. According to the 
candidate applications, 43.2 percent of them have a command of 
foreign languages. 
  The Central Electoral Commission chairman made special note 
of the increase in number of lawyers and economists among the 
candidates, who comprise only about 3 percent of the present 
parliament. Some 145 members of the present body of deputies are 
registered as candidates, Yemets stated. But this is not the 
final figure, since not all the official documents of district 
electoral commissions have yet been processed. 
  The occupational composition of the candidates for people's 
deputy is interesting. Despairing of having to wait for official 
Kiev to adopt an intelligible policy of reforms, businessmen and 
representatives of commercial and entrepreneurial structures 
have aspired to the position of people's deputy. More of them 
are registered as candidates than any other group--13.2 percent. 
After them come state enterprise employees--10.3 percent, 
employees of state administrations--5.4 percent, chairmen and 
functionaries of councils at all levels--6.2 percent, directors 
of state enterprises--4.6 percent, and employees of law 
enforcement organs--5.7 percent. We can add to these figures the 
fact that Acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, 
four deputy prime ministers, and 37 ministers or deputy 
ministers of the current government have been registered as 
candidates for people's deputy. These data provide eloquent 
testimony to the intensity of the struggle for power that is 
under way between representatives of council structures and the 
structures of executive authority. Neither the "council" nor 
"presidential" side has abandoned hope of being victorious in 
the parliamentary election and winning power over to its side 
through legitimate means. 
  Age-wise, the field of registered candidates includes most 
people from 41 to 50 years old--39 percent; candidates 31 to 40 
years old comprise 27.2 percent, 51 to 60--24.3 percent, and 
over 60--4 percent. Yemets made special note of the fact that 
for the first time the election will take place with an age 
requirement: A candidate must be over 25 years old. All the 
same, more than 5 percent are young people from 25 to 30 years 
old. 
  The new parliament of Ukraine promises to be predominantly 
male (just 7.4 percent of the candidates are women) and urban 
(just 14.5 percent of the candidates are from rural localities). 
  Ivan Yemets refused to comment on the election programs of 
the candidates, and assured those present that his commission 
would act in strict compliance with the law. He noted, however: 
"I did have occasion to hear a television broadcast of candidate 
presentations and what they were telling people. Let me say 
quite frankly that I feel sorry for our voters." 
  I. Yemets stated in conclusion that his commission would 
also 
conduct second rounds of voting and repeat elections in those 
districts where the election was null, as well as the June 
election of the president of Ukraine. Yemets called upon the 
citizens of Ukraine to turn out for the election on 27 March. In 
his words, the election, which has not yet even taken place, has 
already "eaten up" more than 1 trillion karbovantsy, money that 
could have been used to help the disabled and the needy. In this 
regard, Yemets stated that if a certain district failed twice to 
elect a people's deputy over the course of a year, no further 
elections would be held. As to how to escape the constitutional 
crisis that could arise if this occurs in the majority of 
districts, the chairman of the Central Electoral Commission 
provided no explanation, and only stated: "There is no need to 
create unforeseen situations."

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Pikhovshek, "Choice," under the </F>
rubric "Of Current Interest": "The Strategy and Tactics of the 
Nomenklatura in the Forthcoming Elections"] 
  [Text] The nature of electoral legislation has been of 
priority significance for the nomenklatura in the past and 
present alike. A law on elections is a law on power. When the 
democrats sat down at the quasi-negotiating table with 
Durdynets, Kotsyuba, and Novitskiy, they should have understood 
that the "party of power" would adhere to the agreements 
previously reached between the blocs of "democrats" and 
"nondemocrats" only as long as they pertained to secondary 
aspects. Meanwhile, power is of the essence. 
  On the whole, all the "amendments and additions" in which 
the 
adopted law differs from the draft pursue just one objective: to 
stay in power. Five real mechanisms have been envisioned to 
accomplish this: 
  1. Reelection of the powers that be for new terms and the 
"sneaking in" of new people who are "ours." 
  2. An opportunity to manipulate the votes of the electorate. 
  3. A consistent antiparty tenor. 
  4. The mechanism of financing the elections. 
  5. The creation of an appropriate informational environment. 
<H3>  The Reelection of the Powers That Be for New Terms and the 
"Sneaking In" of New People Who Are "Ours" </H3>
  The first conclusion is: The law has been "manufactured" to 
favor not even the nomenklatura as such, but just one of its 
groups, namely--the group of the speaker of the parliament. 
Article 14 of the draft provided that "the deputy chairman and 
nine members of the commission shall be appointed by the 
president of Ukraine" to the Central Electoral Commission, 
whereas the law (Article 15) says that "the Central Electoral 
Commission consisting of the chairman, two deputy chairmen, a 
secretary, and 11 members of the commission shall be confirmed 
by the Supreme Council of Ukraine upon presentation by the 
chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine." The situation is 
unique: In essence, Ukraine is the only state in the world in 
which the executive authorities themselves conduct the election 
of the executive authorities, and actually--the parliamentary 
majority, which strives to rob not only the parties and the 
press but also "competitors" from the opposite group of the 
nomenklatura of as much influence on the conduct of the 
elections as possible. 
  To a considerable degree, the vain attempts of the 
nomenklatura to create legislation are focused on a search for a 
secure way out of the trap into which it has driven itself by 
passing the decision on the "professional character" of the 
parliament. It automatically follows from the above that, from 
the moment the new parliament is elected, neither the directors, 
nor the kolkhoz chairmen, nor the generals, nor the 
administrators of the mass media will be able to "shake loose" 
state subsidies, at least not directly while holding at the same 
time positions as managers of establishments in the national 
economy and as members of parliament. However, the nomenklatura 
cannot yield the parliamentary "battlefield" in the struggle for 
state funds; therefore, the issue of the need to have "one of 
our own" in parliament arises. 
  Let us imagine the logic of behavior of a common "worker" 
(soldier, kolkhoz peasant) in a situation in which his immediate 
commander (director, kolkhoz chairman) does not quit his job at 
a certain point before the elections, but merely proclaims his 
obligation to resign in the event he is elected a people's 
deputy. If we disregard the touching desire of the current 
community of people's deputies to protect their director 
colleagues or their people against the threat of losing their 
positions in the case of an election fiasco, the goal of this 
"innovation" in the law becomes more transparent: It is hard to 
imagine that any "worker" will have the slightest desire to 
openly come out against the director-candidate at a conference 
of the labor collective: In the event the manager is not elected 
a deputy, he will resume his professional duties but, rest 
assured, with an excellent recollection of who precisely 
interfered with his occupying the "sweet" seat of a deputy. The 
revenge scenario is completely up to the director's imagination: 
He controls leave pay and days off, duty assignments and 
vouchers, sick pay, and apartment waiting lists. 
<H5>  "Our Man in the Parliament": The Legend of a Labor Collective </H5>
  The so-called "labor collective" (TK) claims the role of the 
"horse" that must carry the nomenklatura people between the rock 
and the hard place--the desire to receive credit and lack of 
opportunity for direct representation in the parliament. 
Incidentally, this notion is without parallel in any legislation 
of the democratic world in whose labor laws employers, hired 
workers, and trade unions are very clearly separated. It is a 
thankless endeavor to roll them into one. 
  How is it that the notion of "labor collective" has migrated 
from the Ukrainian post-Soviet labor legislation into electoral 
legislation? If it were not enough that the Law on Elections 
does not define the labor collective, even the definitions that 
are found in three other laws provide either an ideologized or a 
purely production-oriented definition of the labor 
collective--the "Constitution" ("an element of the political 
system of the country," "a community of people who are free of 
exploitation"), the Code of Labor Law ("all citizens taking part 
in the operation of an enterprise on the basis of a labor 
contract, bargain, or agreement"), and the Law on Enterprises 
("the collective of any enterprise, regardless of form of 
ownership and number of employees"). Not one of the laws assigns 
a political and legal role to the labor collective. The 
demagogic argument that "a person at the place of employment 
knows better who will protect his interests" is called upon to 
conceal the real role assigned by the nomenklatura to the labor 
collective--to manipulate the interests of production in favor 
of political interests, and then not even its own political 
interests, but those of the management. 
  The Law on Elections (Article 23, Point 7) also envisions a 
specific mechanism for manipulating the will of the labor 
collective. In particular, "when a candidate for deputy is 
nominated by a labor collective, a petition shall be signed on 
behalf of the collective by an individual so authorized by a 
meeting or a conference." It is not noted how many members of 
the labor collective must be present at the meeting and what 
particulars should be recorded in the minutes of the 
conference--that is, everything that is indicated in the Law on 
Political Parties and everything that distinguishes the latter 
favorably from the election law. Once again, at issue is the 
fact that the nomenklatura has simplified the procedure for 
nominating its candidate as much as possible rather than the 
antiparty tenor of the election law. 
<H3>  Methods for Manipulating the Votes and the Production of 
"Dead Souls" </H3>
  Chapters regulating the operation of precinct electoral 
commission have undergone the most amendments and additions, 
which have wiped out the potential democratic nature of the law. 
This is not surprising: Ultimately, it is in specific precincts 
that victory or defeat in an election is decided. 
  The introduction of the so-called voter card on a pattern 
used in France was one of the most important aspects of the 
voting procedure proposed in the draft which would prevent abuse 
of votes. The card was supposed to be numbered; one-half of it 
was to be traded in for a ballot, and the second half was to be 
retained by the voter, which hampers potential trickery 
considerably. In the law (Article 40), the voter card magically 
turned into the "ballot" for the receipt of which a citizen 
signs before voting. However, no mechanism is envisioned which 
would subsequently obstruct the replacing of one ballot with 
another. 
  A second opportunity to manipulate votes is built into 
Article 41 of the law. Article 42 of the draft regulates in 
detail the early voting procedure. If a voter changes the 
location "of his sojourn during the period between the 
production of the lists of voters for public familiarization and 
the election day," "the precinct electoral commission shall, at 
the request of the voter and upon the presentation of a passport 
or another document certifying his identity and the voter card 
(invitation), issue a ballot for which the voter shall sign on 
the voter roll, and shall mark the date of voting, ...the ballot 
filled out by the voting person shall be placed by him in a 
ballot box sealed with lead or wax, ...the ballot box shall be 
kept by the precinct electoral commission and opened on the 
general election day." In the law, we see in Article 41 only 
that "if a voter changes the location of his sojourn during the 
period between the production of the lists of voters for public 
familiarization and the election day, he may vote early." The 
absence of clear-cut regulations on procedures for early voting 
in the law suggests the thought that a "loophole" is also 
envisioned here. There is nothing standing in the way of a few 
hundred nonexistent voters--"dead souls"--voting "early," and 
there is no mechanism that would make such voting impossible. 
  Possible abuses of the votes of servicemen should be placed 
in a category by themselves. Thus, the provision on the 
opportunity for servicemen in compulsory service to vote at the 
location of their permanent residence or conscription which was 
envisioned by the draft was "dropped" from the law. Instead, 
Article 20 "Voter Rolls and Procedures for Drawing Them Up," 
which regulates drawing up the rolls of voter-servicemen, says 
that "on 26 February the commanders of military units must bring 
voter rolls to election precincts." However, it was providently 
"forgotten" that a military unit (that is, regiment-level or 
higher) is itself an election precinct and, consequently, the 
commanders should bring these lists to themselves. If we "tie" 
this to restrictions on conducting propaganda in military units, 
which the law also envisions, it will become clear that most 
likely no effective control at all will be exercised over the 
real number of voter-soldiers and the freedom of the expression 
of their will. 
  It is possible to manipulate the votes of the electorate not 
only by using "early voters," "four-month voters," and the 
military. If this turns out to be insufficient, the nomenklatura 
may use another method which Article 42 "Vote Counting at 
Polling Places" suggests is possible. Point 6 of the article 
says the minutes of vote counting shall be compiled in 
triplicate: One copy shall be sent to the district electoral 
commission, another shall remain at the polling station, and the 
third shall be displayed for public inspection. Under the 
circumstances, Western experts consider possible a recurrence of 
the so-called "Romanian scenario" whereby the first sheet is 
stolen, the second damaged, and the third forged. That is to 
say, three copies of the minutes are clearly not enough. 
However, "if they light up the stars, then someone needs it that 
way...." This is vividly confirmed by the fact that proposals to 
draw up five copies of the minutes, two of which would be kept 
by representatives of the public designated by consensus, did 
not gain the support of the majority in the Supreme Council. 
<H5>  The Mechanism of Financing the Elections </H5>
  It is common knowledge that financing "governs" elections. 
Obviously, this issue could not escape the attention of the 
nomenklatura. The law (Article 36, Point 4) specifies that the 
size of the proprietary electoral fund of a candidate for deputy 
should not exceed 10 times the minimum salary. It is clear that 
it is impossible to conduct elections with this kind of money; 
the authors of the draft also understood this. For this reason, 
a total of 15 points were "built into" the draft, of which the 
parliamentary majority kept only eight. For the most part, norms 
that were supposed to prevent abuses during the election 
campaign were omitted: It was proposed to set the size of the 
proprietary fund at 500 minimum wages (an amount with which one 
could at least try to accomplish something); there was a 
mechanism for the rejection by a candidate of nonmonetary 
"presents" that compromise him, for example, paper for printing 
propaganda materials. A restriction was set forth on the 
transfer of funds from legal entities and individuals. However, 
the majority did not pass these wordings, most likely striving 
to achieve a double objective: to use the money of state 
enterprises in the election campaign themselves, and to create a 
situation in which democrats whose search for independent 
sources of financing immediately became illegal could be 
compromised. To be sure, the requirement that data on financing 
be released 20 days after the elections remains, but will it be 
possible to verify such data? Besides, will this verification 
make sense given that its results cannot influence recognition 
or nonrecognition of deputy powers? 
  Since it is clear that in terms of the number of those 
willing to taste the bread of deputy per capita Ukraine is 
coming to rank among the first in the world, due financing for 
the election campaign will become one of the crucial factors of 
election victories. 
<H5>  Creation of an Appropriate Informational Environment </H5>
  Responsibility for informing the public about the course of 
the elections fully devolves on the electoral commissions, that 
is, on Plyushch's people. Thus, it is envisioned that a 
candidate's electoral platform must be published in the local 
state mass media. However, nothing stands in the way of 
publishing the platform of one candidate, say, on 1 February, 
and that of his competitor--on 24 March, that is, three days 
before the elections. A scenario is also possible whereby the 
centralized printing of propaganda materials 20 days before the 
elections in the amount of 2,000 copies per candidate turns from 
an apparent benefit into the opposite. This may happen if 
someone makes a mistake in the last name of the candidate, 
inserts the wrong picture, or confuses something else. The law 
does not even mention whether it is mandatory to have the 
materials printed again at the expense of the state and how 
quickly this should be done. 
  The fact that the parliamentary majority has not passed 
something mandatory for the nonstate mass media, too, is perhaps 
due to the parliamentary majority still not believing in the 
reality of private newspapers and TV and radio broadcasting 
companies influencing the population, rather than to the fact 
that the state has learned to understand the difference between 
private and state property (let us recall the situation 
involving commercial banks). 
  However, noteworthy "homework" may also be found in the 
chapters on the operation of the mass media. Thus, Article 18 of 
the draft, "Organization of Work of the Electoral Commissions" 
says that "all meetings of electoral commissions are held 
publicly." The provision concerning all "publicity" was dropped 
from Article 17 of the law. Instead, "the mandatory notification 
of all members of the electoral commission about the time and 
location of a meeting" is ordained, but nothing is said about 
"mandatory notifications" for journalists, representatives of 
political parties, and foreign observers. It is not ruled out 
that they will simply "forget" to notify some disloyal 
journalists. 
  That the parliament will operate on a professional basis is 
the most surprising point under the circumstances from among 
everything enumerated. Nothing stood in the way of the already 
mentioned directors using an "inseparable bond with the masses" 
as an argument in favor of the need for a people's deputy to 
work in production, as they have done in the case of nominating 
candidates from labor collectives. 
  However, rumors about the number of supporters for combining 
the art of kitchen maid (on the principal job) with that of 
member of parliament (during time off from the principal job) 
increasing catastrophically in the Supreme Council may yet come 
true in some masterpieces from the electoral kitchen, which we 
are eagerly awaiting.

In?"] 
  [Text] Various public opinion surveys will certainly be 
taken on the eve of the elections to the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine; their results will frequently prompt voters to lean 
toward particular political forces. Those who read newspapers 
have already encountered repeatedly sociological statistics 
which are made to fit the "image and likeness" of particular 
parties or candidates and induce citizens to join the majority. 
The psychologists and authors of the advertising texts are aware 
of this. 
  On one occasion the Democratic Initiative research center 
decided to conduct an interesting and, as it turned out, 
instructive experiment. A party that did not figure in the 
political landscape of Ukraine, but which the sociologists gave 
a very tempting name, the Order and Justice Party, was included 
on the list of parties that really exist. It was suggested that 
those polled indicate which party they are leaning toward. 
  The audacious contrivance of the experimenters proved itself 
all the way. In terms of its "popularity," the ghost party took 
an honorable fifth (!) place, leaving many other parties behind, 
including the Socialist and Communist Parties. What would you 
think? Ten percent of those polled intended to vote in future 
elections for a party that does not exist in political nature, 
or, as many as for the Socialist and Communist Parties. A 
strange triumvirate of political forces appeared in the 
imagination of the people, which consisted of two existing 
parties and one mythical party. There was something very 
symbolic about this because the entire election campaign of the 
Socialists and Communists has been built on myths and 
half-truths. 
  The most ludicrous point was that some of the supporters of 
the illusory party turned out to be closely familiar with its 
political program, although such a program does not exist. To be 
sure, such enthusiasts of "order and justice" were not 
numerous--0.1 percent. However, the fact itself cannot fail to 
astonish us as it is eloquent testimony to the level of 
political thinking of a certain proportion of our fellow 
citizens, whose political dreams are reduced to two 
notions--"order" and "justice." As was to be expected, populists 
and demagogues of all hues immediately took advantage of this 
and began to juggle words in the ring of the political circus 
which they themselves created. Naturally, the Ukrainian Justice 
Party has sprung up like a jack-in-the-box; it is headed by 
former military intelligence officer Mykhaylo Hrechko--this is a 
profession that teaches one to collect the necessary information 
and package it properly to one's benefit. 
  So, can surveys and other forms of the study of public 
opinion be trusted? To what degree do their data correspond to 
reality? Sociologists themselves find that only 6 to 8 percent 
of those polled have clearly defined political convictions, and 
10-14 percent try to approach the questions asked in a balanced 
and sensible manner. The remainder are guided solely by 
transient, superficial emotional feelings and do not even try to 
penetrate the essence of the issue. But they are in the 
majority! The results of the elections in Russia are a vivid 
case in point. 
  So, what is the result? If statistics are a mirror of the 
condition of society, are they a warped mirror?... Let us not 
jump to conclusions because surveys, despite their imperfect 
methodology, bear testimony to citizens' current sentiment. 
Naturally we should approach surveys with extreme caution, but 
it is not worthwhile ignoring and neglecting them, either. 
  We know without surveys that at present many people are 
looking for their daily bread rather than spiritual sustenance. 
As the December referendum indicated, two years ago an 
overwhelming majority of citizens of Ukraine could not conceive 
of themselves without independence and democracy, naturally 
hoping for a better life. By now, the horizon of many people has 
shrunk to the size of their stomach. The time of rallies has 
gone, and even the most beautiful slogans no longer work. There 
is little faith in words, just as Shakespeare wrote: "Words have 
become so false that I loathe to speak the truth with them." 
  At this point a Zhirinovskiy comes along and says 
confidently: "People, I will get you out of the abyss and I will 
do it right away." He wins, and he leads them into the abyss. Is 
the possibility of the appearance of such a Zhirinovskiy ruled 
out in our country? 
  Undoubtedly, the elections themselves will be the most 
authentic public opinion survey. Have elections not been already 
tested in the Crimea to a certain degree? More than 1 million 
residents of the Crimea have voted in favor of the "sweet life" 
and "heavenly delights" that were generously promised by the 
leader of the Republican Movement of the Crimea, Yu. Meshkov. He 
skillfully convinced the citizens that once he was elected 
president, the autonomous republic would automatically turn into 
one big Bounty, the Black Sea would flow with milk and honey, 
and the Crimean Mountains would become mountains of gold. 
Meshkov did not rape the residents of the Crimea. He seduced 
them with allusions to "my great potential [rendered in Russian 
in the original]," without overly concealing that this 
"potential" is obviously found in the safes of enterprises such 
as MMM, which would "make yours a golden voucher [rendered in 
Russian in the original]" (in Ukraine itself there are many such 
Meshkovs who will also proclaim their "great potential [rendered 
in Russian in the original]," expressively looking north and 
advocating entry into the ruble zone). 
  Objectively, Nikolay Bagrov had no chance of winning. By 
voting against him, the Crimea voted against the former 
secretary of the oblast committee of the Communist Party of 
Ukraine, whom everybody has gotten sick of, and against 
post-Communist figures who, seizing power on the sunny 
peninsula, displayed their complete inability to control complex 
political and economic processes and yet displayed uncommon 
sagacity in the domain of "grab-it-ization," which each resident 
of the Crimea was well aware of. Thus, the choice in this 
instance came down to a simple alternative: vote for what has 
already been or for what might be. Since it cannot be any worse 
than it is, the choice was made in favor of the person who 
promised a Garden of Eden in the "muscatel-and-cypress republic." 
  However, the Crimea is relatively small. It is hard to hide 
things there, or to hide oneself. Ukraine is large; it is 
possible to hide out there. To be sure, the roots of our 
troubles are hidden and secreted deeply, whereas their 
originators--Communists "and their ilk"--are trying to convince 
everyone that they have nothing to do with the troubles. The 
calculation is simple: Many people still expect solely the state 
rather than themselves to have to worry about their welfare. The 
illusion mounts in society that a real hero will finally come, 
and the next morning life will improve. Once again the 
Communists are angling for this role, as if they were not the 
ones to have already turned life into a frightening story. The 
populist clamor of representatives of post-Communist and 
Communist majority in the parliament demanding the establishment 
of "social justice" of a Bolshevik type is geared primarily 
toward retirees, who number up to 15 million in Ukraine. 
  According to sociological surveys (let us hope that they are 
inaccurate), the once threatening student body is displaying 
strange passivity. It also turns out that among citizens who are 
active in various organizations, members of hobby clubs--i.e. 
those who collect stamps, badges, and so on--rank first (2 
percent). Only 0.6 percent of those polled belong to political 
associations, and 0.8 percent belong to sociopolitical 
associations. Women constitute the predominant proportion of 
voters; it appears that they weep in unison over the artificial 
and unceasing suffering of Maria on TV, finding moral comfort in 
this after the shops and the lines. How will they vote? The 
statistics are silent. As far as I know, no sociological surveys 
devoted particularly to studying the views of women have been 
carried out. 
  So, what are we common voters to do? Are we to wait for 
sociologist-scientists to tell us about ourselves and suggest a 
choice? I, for one, will trust my own experience, my own memory, 
and my own choice.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuleba, NEZAVISIMOST editor in chief, </F>
under the rubric "Political Diary": "Who Pushed Ukraine Into the 
Abyss?"] 
  [Text] Had any person with integrity been in Leonid 
Kravchuk's place, he would have resigned long ago and would have 
quit political life for retirement without much ado--after all, 
he is at the suitable age, too. During the more than two years 
of his presidential rule, Ukraine has achieved impressive 
results--meaning that the paralysis of the economy and the 
financial and credit system, the hyperinflation which has now 
become superhyperinflation, the plundering of the wealth of the 
people, and the association of nomenklatura officials of all 
hues with the criminal underworld--from law enforcement organs 
to the staff of the president and the leadership of the Cabinet 
of Ministers--have reached unheard-of proportions. 
  I have already had occasion to conjecture that the generally 
not-so-poor country could have been brought to its present 
condition either by an absolutely unprepared, incompetent, and 
incapable person, a typical creature of the Communist Party 
system who has leached off the people all his life, or on the 
contrary, by a very skillful and flexible tactician pursuing the 
goal set for him by his own party comrades: to pervert the idea 
of acquiring independence and statehood as thoroughly as 
possible, to extinguish the enthusiasm of the people, and to 
dispel illusions of an independent path for Ukraine. 
  They say that a blind person leading the blind will 
unavoidably lead them into an abyss. We had not even managed to 
grasp this and catch on to it before we found ourselves in a 
state of "free fall." Enterprises are closing down; people are 
being thrown out onto the street; wages and scholarships are not 
paid for several months in a row; the threat of the destruction 
of the Donbass and other large industrial regions is real; the 
Crimea has virtually been surrendered without a fight--but they 
continue to do an ideological "snow" job on us with a crooked 
half-smile: Nothing horrible is happening, they say. If the 
statement that the retinue makes the king is true, then Leonid 
Kravchuk's circle, all those 
Slepichevs-Simonenkos-Ternopolskiys-Mikhalchenkos--have worked 
hard to create the image that now accompanies our president. One 
could ascertain this easily by entering just any store (where, 
incidentally, neither L. Kravchuk nor his retinue have ever set 
foot). They have long been barricaded in the "golden cage" of 
the former Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine 
as they "resolve their issues." 
  The "acting prime minister," Yefim Zvyahilskyy, who is 
operating deep in the underground, carried on even more 
clandestinely. He is the one whom nobody has ever seen anywhere 
in person: Yefim Leonidovich prefers to give leading 
instructions from the chambers of his personal office, 
studiously avoiding meetings not only with "commoners" but even 
with leaders of all ranks. Meanwhile, his appearance in the 
position of prime minister (even if "acting") is far from 
random. As Ivan Plyushch observed once, Ye. Zvyahilskyy is one 
of the richest people in Ukraine. Please note that he was not 
confirmed as a candidate by the parliament; he ended up in his 
present position thanks to an edict of the president. Aware of 
what many edicts of L. Kravchuk stand for, the most odious of 
which have been "retracted" under pressure from public opinion, 
one may only guess which influential forces and how many 
powerful people were behind this appointment! 
  Last week RUKH-PRESS voiced, among others, yet another 
version of the disappearance of Mikhail Boychishin: He was in 
possession of documents concerning the involvement of major 
government figures with mafia circles. Let us note that xeroxed 
copies of these documents are in the possession of the 
NEZAVISIMOST editorial office. (It is just that they should not 
be in any hurry to "hack" the documents out of me or other 
members of the staff because, as far as is known, a few copies 
of the documents are being held by the editorial offices of 
Moscow and foreign publications which are prepared to publish 
them at any time). Their authenticity is beyond doubt. Judging 
by their content and peculiar details found in the documents, 
they were drawn up with assistance from the special services, if 
not with their direct participation. We are prepared to furnish 
them to competent organs, but only on one condition: If they 
unravel the "mystery" of Boychishin's disappearance, after all. 
If this case is going to be "swept under the rug" just as the 
investigation of the murder of Vadim Boyko was, the editorial 
office will have to release the materials in its possession, 
after all. 
  To be sure, last week our law enforcement organs 
distinguished themselves, after all. On 12 February (do you 
remember the horrible cold?), a group of UNSO [Ukrainian 
People's Self-Defense Forces] riflemen was arrested during a 
"drill session" at Lysaya Gora in Kiev. There were candidates 
for people's deputy among the riflemen (therefore, a violation 
of the Law on Elections, according to which the electoral 
commission should sanction the arrest of a registered candidate, 
is obvious). In general this entire episode seemed strange from 
the very outset. "Exercises" of UNSO commandos have been 
underway for several years now, frequently with real weapons 
rather than, like this time, with the use of "models." However, 
this is what is noteworthy: The searches conducted produced no 
results, although a lot of "froth" arose. Is it a surprising 
coincidence that the persecution of UNSO combatants coincided 
precisely with the beginning of the election campaign? The 
arrests at Lysaya Gora came close to frustrating the second 
regional conference of the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly] in 
Lvov. While commenting on the events, the leader of the assembly 
from Lvov, Andrey Shkil, promised at the conference: Even if 
they arrest everyone, we will come to power anyway. As far as 
the situation in the Crimea is concerned, he noted: We are men 
of action, and for this reason the Crimea will either be 
Ukrainian or it will be uninhabited. It is hard to say what the 
actions of law enforcement organs exhibit more of--awkward and 
helpless attempts to prevent the existence of an unregistered 
paramilitary organization which holds its "exercises" virtually 
in downtown Kiev or the aspiration to promote the UNSO before 
the elections. To be sure, there is someone whose example they 
follow. Can one look more helpless than our president in the 
context of the latest Crimean events? 
  And yet, the results of elections in the Crimea are truly 
impressive. For the first time since 1917, the people have 
elected as their leader a man "in the street" who is not 
burdened by the communist past and who has never belonged to the 
nomenklatura merry-go-round. We happened to hear about Yuriy 
Meshkov for the first time in August 1991, when having tried in 
vain to persuade the Communists in the parliament to move on 
Foros to "rescue their general secretary," he made a desperate 
single-handed attempt and...was apprehended by the already 
mentioned law enforcement organs, perhaps so that he would not 
"get in the way" and disrupt the "putsch" scenario. Even then it 
became obvious that Yu. Meshkov has a quite nonstandard, 
original personality. This was confirmed by his unconventional 
visits to Kiev and Moscow and the selection of the "foreigner" 
Yevgeniy Saburov as prime minister, to say nothing about the 
tenor of his presentations on TV and the sacramental phrase at 
the latest press conference: "I do not report to the president 
of Ukraine on work performed"--an elegant flick on the nose. 
  In the Crimea presidential elections have already been held, 
whereas here it is still unclear whether such will indeed occur 
or whether Leonid Kravchuk with "the comrades" will try to "nix" 
them. There is much indirect evidence in favor of this 
supposition, for example, the colossal activity of 
representatives of the party of power, their altogether sickly 
interest in districts being "jammed" with candidates--you go and 
figure out who to vote for. In this case, elections to the 
Supreme Council may not be validly held, or Ukraine will get 
bogged down in permanent elections. A lot of energy and funds 
will be needed! This is when the president will come on stage in 
order to announce magnanimously: Given that the Cabinet of 
Ministers in essence does not exist, and the parliament has not 
been elected, I have resolved to stay on as president a little 
longer. As far as the parliament is concerned, it will be 
federal: There will be 10 people from each oblast (on the 
personal responsibility of the representative of the 
president--note by Vladimir Kuleba). 
  A different turn of events is not ruled out. Leonid Kravchuk 
will announce his firm intention to not run for president a 
second time even before the parliamentary elections. There will 
be no need to look far for explanations: For Kravchuk to become 
a candidate in the catastrophic situation which Ukraine is now 
facing would be pouring oil on the flaming fire of discontent. 
In this case, he has one last hope: The parliament of the new 
term will cancel the previously announced presidential elections. 
  At present, when the election campaign is merely beginning 
to 
"get in gear," the editorial office is receiving a multitude of 
letters and calls from the localities concerning all kinds of 
violations and contrivances on the part of the nomenklatura: 
undisguised sabotage, obstruction of meetings between candidates 
and the people, delays in processing documents, and so on. The 
method of "neutralizing" particular democratic candidates by 
nominating "doubles" is widespread. For example, if a doctor of 
sciences who is a democrat registers in a district, it is 
countered with another doctor. If you are a colonel, we will 
nominate a general. Let the people wrack their brains later. Or 
else, a complete joke: Rukh is fielding a candidate, a metal 
worker named Nikolay Nikolayevich Levchenko, and the local 
bureaucracy hustled and found a worthy rival for him, likewise 
Nikolay Nikolayevich, and likewise Levchenko, except that he is 
a milling machine operator. On the ballot, their last names will 
appear next to each other. 
  If we were to try projecting the overall picture, I think 
that left-wing forces, the Communists and the Socialists, will 
dominate the parliament. This is logical in a way. Within a 
comparatively short period of time our society has travelled the 
path from euphoria to disappointment and pessimism. 
Impoverished, undernourished, poorly clad people who have lost 
faith and are tired of instability are instinctively backing up 
in order to return to life as it was, though "the boat has 
already been missed." Since the Communists-Socialists are not up 
to offering any alternative creative idea, they are doomed to a 
crushing defeat, just like the national-radicals at present. 
Paradoxical as it is, it might be better for them to win the 
election after all, and to form their own government. Two or 
three years from now it will be possible to ask: "Well, our 
Communist friends, what has been accomplished?" This will be 
when they will be forced to retire forever from the political 
arena. I believe that such a scenario is still better than the 
current one, whereby anything and everything is being exported 
from Ukraine, the country is on the brink of disaster, but those 
responsible are nowhere to be found because one is sick, another 
stupid, and yet another is just an "acting" official.

<F P=106> [Article by NEZAVISIMOST observer Yanina Sokolovskaya: "The </F>
Crimean Triangle--Alas, Not a Love Triangle. In It, the Fifth 
Wheel Is the Betrayed Voter"] 
  [Text] Hardly had the postelection passions subsided, 
hardly had the rallies and the political terror abated, when two 
individuals returned to Crimea from Russia, each of them capable 
of influencing the fate of the peninsula. The first--the Russian 
Yevgeniy Saburov--turned up here in order to test his reforming 
abilities, carrying out the slogans of Yu. Meshkov. The 
appearance of the other, Nikolay Bagrov, who had been staying 
with St. Petersburg relatives, could act as a brake on the 
beginning of the Crimean president. 
  Nikolay Bagrov made a statement about this without beating 
around the bush at the very first press conference: "I confirm 
my disagreement with the pre-election program of the president. 
It is impracticable. But I must help Crimea get out of the 
economic crisis." 
  Three weeks ago, Yuriy Meshkov, already aware of the 
resignation of his rival, played to the public, saying: "Such a 
smart specialist as Bagrov cannot be disregarded. I will be 
happy cooperate with him." Now that the Supreme Council of 
Crimea has voted down the speaker's resignation, the variously 
directed politicians will have to come together in a single 
harness. Will it be for long? 
  It is not inconceivable that the enforced Bagrov-Meshkov 
union will be delayed. Crimean political scientists predict that 
at the end of March, Leonid Makarovych will offer Nikolay 
Vasilyevich the position of Crimean presidential representative. 
The deputies of the Supreme Council of Ukraine are talking about 
the same thing in the corridors of power. And the Crimea and 
Ukraine Committee stated: "Bagrov the politician will not work 
well with Meshkov, and this will be to the benefit of Ukraine." 
  The clash of the three political figures is capable of 
changing the Crimean situation in unpredictable fashion. 
Especially since Yuriy Meshkov, upon coming to power, suddenly 
failed to find around himself a team of like-thinkers and was 
compelled to turn to all of the ministers and committee chairmen 
and their deputies with the call, "Everyone stay where you are." 
"No one is going to displace you," he exhorted the denizens of 
the Council of Ministers. Much the same had been promised the 
government bureaucrats by their future leader, Yevgeniy Saburov. 
  However, these promises were perceived without rapture. They 
evoked a reaction of concealed sabotage: Many of the Council of 
Ministers' deputy chairmen left in a state of diplomatic 
illness. And their former head Samsonov packed himself off on 
leave, offering Yuriy Meshkov his deserted office. 
  The Crimean president, however, suffering greatly for lack 
of 
a residence, resolved the sore point in his own way, taking an 
office in the former oblast Communist Party Committee of Crimea, 
which earlier belonged to Leonid Grach. 
  Now the wounded leader of the Communist Party republic 
committee is counting on compensating the loss through the 
political continuity of the new owner of the apartments. And in 
some ways, he is decidedly not far wrong. Yuriy Meshkov began 
work at his new post with a "swelling of the staff"--the 
formation of his own administration and a group of advisers 
comprising 60 people. Observers have already called these 
actions unconstitutional: According to Crimean legislation, the 
president heads the government; the ministers act as advisers, 
and he is not entitled to an administration. 
  The prime ministership of Yevgeniy Saburov likewise seems 
fairly shaky. Since the Constitution provides only for the 
position of deputy prime minister, now occupied. The man in this 
position is Anatoliy Franchuk, who has worked well with the 
president.... While Yuriy Meshkov, who until recently worked 
for the Crimean Constitution, is attempting to disengage himself 
from the trap of its articles, he will not be up to any new 
edicts. But then, the president is feeling out contact with 
Crimean parties and movements. The other day, he even conducted 
a roundtable with their representatives. But in the opinion of 
Majlis deputy chairman Refat Chubarov, this will hardly improve 
relations between the Tatars and the president: The sides have 
taken a wait-and-see position. 
  Much more concrete is the disposition of the Ukrainian Civic 
Congress of Crimea [UGKK], which resolved to consolidate its 
forces and the Tatars' "against the expansion of pro-Russian 
tendencies in Crimea." 
  "Crimea is becoming yet another stage in the genocide 
against 
everything Ukrainian," announced UGKK representatives to Nikolay 
Mikhalchenko, head of the Ukrainian president's service dealing 
with internal politics. And, in their words, they forced 
official Kiev to do some serious thinking. 
  This thoughtfulness was probably transmitted to the 
parliament as well, which decided a few days ago to fix the 
logical stress marks in the Crimean question. The decree adopted 
by the Supreme Council of Ukraine "On the Status of the 
Autonomous Republic of Crimea...." "explicates" that Crimea 
cannot change the state borders of Ukraine, or enter into 
political relations with foreign states, or have its own 
military formations and monetary system. In the course of a 
month, Crimea's parliament is advised to bring the Constitution 
and laws of the republic into conformity with Ukrainian ones. 
  However, during the discussion of this ticklish question at 
the session, broadcast transmission from Kiev was strategically 
blocked by the local radio station. Is it not for this reason 
that official Simferopol is still in no state to evaluate the 
resolution of the Ukrainian people's deputies? 
  It seems that the very authors of the document did not count 
on concrete results. And not only because the decree makes no 
provision for responsibility for its nonfulfillment. Simply, the 
month's time allotted Crimea runs out on 24 March--at the height 
of the election campaign. 
  "The document has no legislative weight--it just states the 
situation. This is natural; after all, the de facto author of 
Crimean autonomy is the president of Ukraine," summarized A. 
Tkachuk, deputy chairman of the deputy commission dealing with 
questions of legislation and legality. 
  The newly fledged decree is capable of impeding only the 
introduction of the ruble in Crimea. As R. Shpek, minister of 
economics, explained, "This would complicate the accounting 
process and the tax system. L. Kravchuk proposed to Yu. Meshkov 
that he present "ruble" calculations. He did not do this in 
time. And now it is too late." 
  To Crimeans, pecking at the pro-Russian/ruble plan of their 
president, only one thing is left that is not forbidden out of 
all the pre-election promises--the introduction of Moscow time. 
  It seems as though the Crimeans are not to see the mountains 
of gold guaranteed by Yuriy Meshkov. Just as earlier, they did 
not receive the political tranquility promised by Nikolay 
Bagrov. Will the hopes of the third--Nikolay Bagrov--be 
fulfilled? Opinions were shared at NEZAVISIMOST's open 
microphone.

That It Thinks Too Much of Itself: The Demand To Bring the 
Constitution of Crimea Into Compliance With the Ukrainian 
Constitution May Ultimately Embroil Yuriy Meshkov With the 
Parliamentarians of the Peninsula. But Then It May Not"] 
  [Text] The Supreme Council of Ukraine has obligated the 
Crimean parliament to bring the Constitution of the peninsula 
into compliance with the Ukrainian Constitution currently in 
effect. At first sight, this was quite a logical step, 
especially if we recall that the federal authorities of Russia 
have also repeatedly taken care of compliance by the 
constitutions of republics belonging to the Russian Federation 
with the Main Law of the country. However, to this day there are 
many nonconforming constitutions in Russia. As a rule, in Moscow 
they pay particular attention to articles in the constitutions 
of the republics that are openly disloyal to the center and try 
to ignore the still more nonconforming articles in the 
constitutions of Federation components that are friendly to 
Moscow. Just one republic belongs to Ukraine, and for as long as 
it was led by Nikolay Bagrov, the Supreme Council in Kiev did 
not strive to work on the constitutional problems of the Crimea, 
probably proceeding from the same Russian rule--loyalty in 
exchange for legality. The situation has changed following the 
victory of Yuriy Meshkov in presidential elections in the 
Crimea, and the gun Bagrov has loaded may now very well be fired 
in the hands of the new Crimean president. Nonetheless, the 
Constitution of Crimea does not contradict the current Ukrainian 
Constitution so seriously as for strict compliance with its 
norms to be really able to bring about some kind of explosive 
consequences in relations between Ukraine and the Crimea. 
  In passing their decree, the members of parliament probably 
proceeded from a certain outlook, just as they did when they 
offered President Leonid Kravchuk new powers in keeping with 
which he now has the right to cancel by his decisions all 
unconstitutional decrees of the Crimean authorities. First, the 
already adopted Constitution of the Crimea could fail to conform 
to the new Constitution of Ukraine, which is being worked on. In 
this case, the Crimean parliamentarians will have to turn to 
their Main Law yet again, of course, if they follow 
recommendations from Kiev right now. Second, the Supreme Council 
of Crimea, like the Supreme Council of Ukraine, is living out 
its last days, and not even months. The members of parliament 
from Kiev counted on boosting their preelection ratings by this 
decree (many of them are running for the new Supreme Council, 
too), whereas following the commandments from Kiev will hardly 
be helpful to the Crimean parliamentarians. However, Kiev has 
given the deputies of the Supreme Council of the Crimea a good 
opportunity to restrict the powers of the Crimean president, 
whom the Supreme Council intensely dislikes, while it is still 
possible. 
  The defeated "party of power" in the Crimea may very well 
take advantage of the legal base proposed by Kiev in order to 
make presidential powers not so wide by far--after all, they 
were written up for Nikolay Bagrov, and not at all for Yuriy 
Meshkov. However, the Crimean parliamentarians will hardly go 
for this open confrontation with the new president precisely 
because the Supreme Council of Crimea does not have much time to 
work. The opportunity to comply with the decision of Kiev may 
come to the fore only in the event that the "party of power," 
which was defeated in the presidential elections, wins a rematch 
during the parliamentary elections and looks for a pretext to 
consolidate its power and restrict the power of the president. 
In that case, the decree of Kiev might come in very handy. It 
may be that the Constitution will be amended without any regard 
for the decree, simply in keeping with the wishes of the new 
parliamentarians. However, it becomes clear from the results of 
the presidential elections in the Republic of Crimea and a 
public opinion poll that forces supporting Yuriy Meshkov and a 
number of figures subscribing to political views that are 
similar to his have a chance to win the elections to the Supreme 
Council of Crimea, too. This kind of new parliament will hardly 
pay any attention at all to the decrees of the parliament in 
Kiev.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Karpen: "What One Can See and What One </F>
Cannot See on the Television Screen"] 
  [Text] Frankly, we did not want to return to this subject. 
VECHIRNIY KYYIV has often criticized the provincialism, low 
artistic and professional level of television programs, 
undemocratic atmosphere, and the introduction of internal 
political censorship at the state television and radio company. 
Naturally, in doing so, it was not our intention to insult the 
directors of the company and, least of all, our fellow 
journalists, who have very little influence over what is 
happening under the existing system. The purpose of our 
criticism -- and various people have expressed themselves on 
this subject -- was to help eliminate the shortcomings listed 
above. Like the majority of television viewers and radio 
listeners, we are sincerely concerned about national television 
and radio broadcasting, and it pains us to see its backwoods 
[sharovarnu --from "sharovary" -- the baggy pantaloons 
originally worn by the Cossacks, now symbolizing the folkloric 
traditions promoted by Soviet authorities in place of normal 
cultural development] ineptness. To be sure, standing out 
against the general backdrop of drabness, we find some 
successful programs and brilliant journalists, but these are not 
able to reveal their full potential and evolve into a system 
that would allow us to give a sigh of relief that here, at last, 
we are witnessing the emergence of our own national television. 
  Naively, one might have expected that the serious criticism 
(which appeared in many newspapers, not just the VECHIRKA) would 
produce serious changes in the television and radio company 
itself. But this did not happen; a few cosmetic changes and a 
reshuffling among the top management did not result in any 
improvements. There are two reasons for this: first, the state 
television and radio company is fully financed by the state and 
has no serious competition, and, second, the small group of top 
managers, headed by Mr. Okhmakevych and Mr. Pasak, have 
established a strong defensive position on this state-protected 
high ground out of range of cannon fire. As for any competitors 
that emerge on the inside, the company has learned to make short 
work of them very quickly. 
  Thus this particular piece has been provoked by an article 
by 
Vitaliy Ablitsov, director of the Kultura Creative Association 
of Ukrainian Television [UT], that appeared in the newspaper 
HOLOS UKRAYINY on 5 February 1994 under the title: "UT: A Symbol 
of Provincialism or the Rebirth of Hope?" Understandably, Mr. 
Ablitsov assumes the role of advocate of the management, but 
even he cannot help but admit that "Ukrainian television 
as an integral system of the electronic medium of communication 
simply does not exist. What we have today is merely an aggregate 
of television broadcasts and programs gasping for breath in the 
vise of foreign-language television networks. The authors of 
these programs, because of our technical backwardness, and 
frequently due to their own creative ineptness, are incapable of 
handling the swelling flood of information." 
  The author then proceeds to portray the criticism of the UT 
management that had appeared in the newspapers NEZAVISIMOST, 
VECHIRNIY KYYIV, and LIBERALNA HAZETA as a "noisy campaign on 
the theme `Help! They are introducing censorship in television 
and radio'." Yet he produces not a single argument to refute the 
criticism published in the press. Instead, we find accusations 
levelled in the usual Pasak style that the journalists from the 
newspapers named above are, at best, creatively inept. Let these 
charges remain on Mr. Ablitsov's conscience, while I cite an 
example of how the internal climate at the television and radio 
company is viewed by the company's own journalists. 
  "Let me name the employees of the state television and 
radio company who at different times were forced to leave their 
jobs either because they were hounded from their positions or 
because they became totally disillusioned about the ability of 
Mykola Okhmakevych's company to provide viewers with truthful 
and honest information: Vasyl Yurychko -- vice-president of the 
company (his ouster was masterminded by Viktor Pasak, who has 
taken over his post); Mykola Orlovskyy -- former editor in chief 
of UT's Main Information Department (he was ousted from his job 
on Okhmakevych's orders by Yarema Frydrak, the former 
vice-president of the company, who was later himself ousted by 
Okhmakevych); Mykola Knyazhytskyy -- pushed out because of his 
courageous political commentaries; Mykola Kanishevskyy -- could 
no longer tolerate the atmosphere of lies that reigns at the 
television company; Natalka Hryhorchuk -- correspondent of the 
Main Information Department (the case against her was fabricated 
by Ivan Kukhar, who, following a certain fiasco, was transferred 
from his post as editor in chief of UT's Main Information 
Department to his old position of director of the 
correspondents' network). 
  "Stepan Demyanchuk, the general director of UT 
programming, was harrassed for a prolonged period of time under 
the personal direction of Okhmakevych, and only his death 
"saved" him from being dismissed in disgrace. 
  "At Ukrainian Radio, persecution shortened the lives of 
Mynko, Kulakivskyy, Bil. The person responsible for this was 
Volodymyr Reznikov, who now heads the Main Directorate of 
Programs at UT. 
  "This list is incomplete -- there is not enough time. 
Let me just say that Kuzmenko is next on the hit list..." 
  I have not named the author for understandable reasons. Nor 
have I provided the names of other journalists at the television 
and radio company who are being persecuted by the management -- 
they are still employed by the company. But let me describe what 
happened to the Hart Youth Program and its director, Viktor 
Pavlyuk. Because the program criticized the governing 
structures, it was not permitted to air and Viktor Pavlyuk was 
threatened with dismissal. The incident became widely known. 
Pavlyuk filed a suit in court, and Okhmakevych and Co. are doing 
their best to hush up the conflict. 
  Having brought up the Hart Studio, we should mention that 
the 
stifling conservative atmosphere at the television and radio 
company recently forced such talented journalists as Vasyl 
Yatsura, Volodymyr Nechyporuk, and Serhiy Sotnychenko to leave 
the company. They are now working for UNIAN. And what about the 
many highly qualified television camera operators and video 
engineers who found themselves jobs outside UT--at least half of 
the entire staff has done so in recent years. Quite a few of 
them have gone to Moscow. Given these facts, is it any wonder 
that the level of our television programming is as low as it is? 
  Do the people in the government structures to whom the State 
Television and Radio Company is answerable know all this? Of 
course, they do: they received letters from the people who were 
persecuted at this company. Then why do they not apply the 
necessary measures? We can only assume that they think that it 
is better to have this kind of management as long as it is 
loyal, that it is better to have an inept television and radio 
as long as it is biddable. The question of Mr. Okhmakevych's 
directorship of the company has been raised several times in the 
Supreme Council, but each time he has managed to get out of the 
water without getting wet. It means a great deal to have 
powerful patrons. 
  The handling of the election campaign -- perhaps the most 
important event in the life of Ukraine today -- is a separate 
topic that deserves mention. In this extremely important sphere, 
national television and radio could do a great deal to provide 
objective coverage of the process of putting forward candidates, 
the registration of candidates for the office of deputy, the 
candidates' ideas and programs. They could help citizens to find 
their way around the myriad of names that have emerged on the 
electoral horizon. They could -- if they wanted to. Not only are 
our television and radio, which have been leased out to Messrs. 
Kulyk and Pasak, not portraying the campaign objectively, but 
they are failing to comply with the letter and spirit of the 
Election Law. For example, candidates have absolutely no access 
to UT-1 [Ukrainian Television's Channel 1]. Mr. Kulyk is of the 
opinion that it is enough for political parties to present their 
platforms. There is nothing wrong in that -- the people ought to 
know what the parties stand for. But, first, the Election Law 
gives the right of access to television and radio not only to 
parties but also to candidates, associations of citizens, labor 
collectives who put forward candidates, and other 
representatives, and, second, what about the independent 
candidates who do not belong to any party? Mr. Kulyk could not 
care less. 
  Thus, UT-1 is virtually closed to candidates. UT's attitude 
is: let them appear on regional programs. Meanwhile, UT-1 is 
itself covertly taking part in the preelection struggle. For 
instance, our readers have noted that for some reason attention 
has recently been focused on the Popilnya Rayon of Zhytomyr 
Oblast. If it isn't the presidential representative, then it's 
the collective farm chairman on our television screens. Popilnya 
has been receiving more television coverage in the last few 
weeks than during the entire past year. The reason for all this 
attention is very simple: that is where Mr. Okhmakevych himself 
is running for the office of deputy. He has the right to do so 
under the Election Law, but what has state television to do with 
this? 
  Thus, contrary to the Election Law and common sense, the 
management of the television and radio company has banished 
candidates for the office of deputy from UT-1 and forced them to 
go to regional television programs. Moreover, on instructions 
from the management of the company, the Kiev program (on UT-2) 
is now airing candidates' appearances from 1600 to 1800. Can 
conscientous citizens who work in production and in institutions 
benefit from television's role as an intermediary? It seems that 
the television management has done everything in its power to 
torpedo the election in the informational sphere. Whether it has 
done so on its own initiative or at the behest of the government 
-- I do not pretend to know. But facts are facts. 
  The last thing I want the management of the television and 
radio company to think is that this article is in response to 
the unceremonious interference in the form of a preelection 
propaganda campaign waged against me by state radio on their 
initiative. One would be hard put to find an incident of this 
sort in a democratic country. No other state permits this kind 
of pressure on voters. But this has no bearing on the subject 
under discussion -- a subject that has long caused great concern 
to all who care about the fate of national television and radio. 
  As to the direct participation of state television and radio 
in the preelection propaganda campaign against me, why do so 
covertly, anonymously, making use of the Kiev radio program, 
whose journalists have no connection to this matter whatsoever? 
I would like to suggest a simple but honest move to the esteemed 
directors of the company: let us go public and hold a discussion 
on live radio or television. I am willing to meet with either 
Mr. Okhmakevych, or Mr. Pasak, or Mr. Kulyk, or all three. A 
frank and open discussion which would allow both sides to have 
their say and would be a democratic [word illegible], inasmuch 
as people would have an opportunity to judge for themselves the 
truth and [word illegible] of the arguments put forward by both 
sides and draw their own conclusions. 
  I am at your service, gentlemen, 
  [Signed] Vitaliy Karpen

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Pikhovshek: "The Self-Preservation </F>
Instinct, or the Mobilization of the Nomenklatura"] 
  [Text] Ukrainians know by sight many of those who 
were registered on 15 February as candidates for people's deputy 
of Ukraine. Among the claimants to the deputy pie are about 300 
presidential representatives in the localities and 250 chairmen 
of local councils; there are six officials of the special 
services, Defense Minister Radetskyy, and 28 former and current 
members of the Ukrainian Government. For the first time, there 
has truly emerged the paradoxical situation of competition among 
the nomenklatura. In many regions of the state, especially in 
its central part, the following pattern of intranomenklatura 
"apportionment" may be observed: Competing against each other 
are the local presidential representative, the local council 
chairman, envoys of the Kiev teams of Plyushch and Kravchuk, a 
local kolkhoz chairman and the director of a small plant.... 
  The fact that the nomenklatura has not been able to share 
the 
positions among "its own" is in itself cause for surprise, but 
no less interesting is the fact that there is now practically no 
one to head the Ukrainian Government. The following persons have 
suspended the performance of their official duties for the 
duration of the election campaign: Acting Prime Minister 
Zvyahilskyy; Deputy Prime Ministers Yevtukhov, Landik, and 
Zhulynskyy; Ministers Shpek, Pyatachenko, Kaskevych, Dotsenko, 
Karasyk, and Golubchenko; State Television and Radio Company 
Chairman Okhmakevych, who, in the confusion of the elections 
even organized his own micro-party; and Arbitration Court 
Chairman Prytik. The state is being run by deputies. 
  From circles close to the president's, this information has 
come: Despite the fact that in his public statements, Kravchuk 
demonstrates full confidence in the victory of "his people," the 
real situation there is close to panic. One may consider as 
indirect confirmation of this the fact that at least five 
presidential advisers are registered as candidates for people's 
deputy of Ukraine. One could also evaluate this as an attempt by 
the president to gain the support of at least a modest circle of 
deputies in the new parliament; however, the facts testify that 
no aspirants to the vacant adviser's positions are to be found 
among the nomenklatura members. 
  It seems as if the current elections are a matter of life 
and 
death to the nomenklatura. "What is happening now in Kiev around 
the national-democratic forces," says Les Tanyuk, member of the 
Rukh leadership, "reminds one of a return to 1989." The 
mysterious disappearance of Mikhail Boychishyn, who seriously 
impeded Rukh's operational activity, became the beginning of a 
total examination of this organization by various interested 
institutions. It is well known that the accounts of Rukh's 
Ukrainian sponsors have been frozen, and incidents have 
multiplied of persecution of Rukh figures on the part of 
criminal circles and of unlawful searches of the apartments of 
Rukh leaders, especially outside Kiev, where the nomenklatura 
still comports itself like a bull in a china shop. Although 
there is no information that would make it possible to draw 
fairly well-founded conclusions about the beginning of a 
single-minded campaign against Rukh, which its leaders insist is 
the case, the fact remains that a year ago Rukh did not feel 
such forcible pressure. 
  It seems that Ukraine is gradually turning into a big 
Crimea, 
with its political terrorism and game-playing during the 
election preparations. The nomenklatura really did their 
homework and invented a mass of simple and painfully 
understandable "double plays," which allowed them to win the 
elections before the elections. 
  If naive Western observers come to the polling stations 
after 
20 March, then they, aside from the hospitable nomenklatura 
receptions, with the obligatory champagne and caviar, will 
receive every opportunity to become convinced of how fairly and 
in what complete conformity with the law the elections were 
being held. The nomenklatura is winning the elections now, not 
burdening itself with the invention of subtle and hardly 
perceptible mechanisms. 
  The professional nomenklatura members in Krivoy Rog set up 
debates among the candidates without any warning to the voters. 
Tuesday, 25 January, an absolutely normal workday, is memorable 
to industrial Dneprodzerzhinsk for a rally that was held by the 
director of the Azot joint-stock company, Aleksandr Leonidovich 
Levchenko, who was running in the 83d Electoral District. 
Probably in order to stir up the interest of the future voters, 
he conveyed the workers to imeni Garanina Square in four buses, 
at the expense of their home enterprise. The free "hooky day" 
made everybody very happy. 
  In Nemirov's Electoral District No. 58, there are five 
nomenklatura members competing against one another 
simultaneously. One of them is Comrade Kotsyuba, famous 
throughout all Ukraine. It is not such a big deal that Oleksandr 
Pavlovych has not managed to be president, even--he is a busy 
man, these things happen. It is not such a big deal that the 
documents for his registration were gathered by people with a 
high profile in Nemirov--workers of the local court and bar. 
Kotsyuba turned out to be enough of a "heavy hitter" for the 
people in Vinnitsa that he was already registered after 26 
January, and the presentation of Rukh's local branch to the 
court was left with no answer of any kind. 
  There are enough violations in the capital, as well. In one 
of Kiev's electoral districts, the local communist organization 
produced an excerpt from its party conference, which "nominated" 
candidates for people's deputy. An independent examination of 
the home addresses of people who were allegedly present at the 
conference established the participation of "dead souls." It 
turns out that Communist Party pensioners were making use of the 
old discount cards of former CPSU members who had long ago left 
Kiev or who had recently died. The popular verbal flourish "a 
Communist remains a Communist, even after death" has at last 
found its own practical application. 
  The battle of the nomenklatura clans of the village, rayon, 
oblast, and "Kievan" levels is steeped in mutually exclusive 
interests. Many members of the nomenklatura, not wishing to 
experience happiness in cities of millions, have dashed off to 
the modest towns and villages and have been surprised to see 
there not only their former colleagues from the parliament, but 
also the fact that the local nomenklatura has in fairly serious 
fashion been working with the voters through the delivery of 
mineral fertilizers and the construction of kindergartens. The 
phenomenon where, as in Nemirov, several nomenklatura candidates 
are nominated to compete among themselves is a sign not only of 
the fact that the local regions enjoy a "promising" reputation 
among members of the nomenklatura (remember that among the "sons 
of Lieutenant Schmidt," educated Moscow and polar Minusinsk did 
not enjoy popularity, while all of the "sons" were ready to 
travel to Bobruisk and Vitebsk at once), but also of a more 
important circumstance--among the nomenklatura there exists no 
single "leading and guiding center." It is not inconceivable, 
however, that in a situation of mutual removal of candidacies in 
favor of a more successful nomenklatura member and of repeat 
elections, such a center, spontaneously or not, would still 
emerge. Now it is possible to observe several such 
centers--Kravchuk's, Plyushch's, and those of the defense and 
agrarian sectors, among whom mutual understanding is not 
achievable. 
  True, the internal conflicts of the nomenklatura are 
balanced 
out by discord among the democratic candidates. 
  Meanwhile, the experience of the latest presidential 
elections demonstrates that it is impossible to convince the 
democrats to cede their single club to a competitor, whereas the 
nomenklatura is saved by its instinct for self-preservation.

<F P=106> [Report by Vitaliy Kononov, Head of the PZU [Green Party of </F>
Ukraine]: "The Political Situation in Our Country and the Tasks 
of the PZU (From His Report to the Fourth PZU Congress)"] 
  [Text] What stance do the "Greens" take on the 
economy? 
  We are inspired by Lanovoy's economic program. But we also 
have our own view of Ukraine's development. The "Greens" 
advocate market-type reforms, the formation of private property, 
and the most rapid possible privatization. Moreover, our 
deputies in the parliament will speak out in favor of radical 
economic changes in Ukraine--this is our second task at the 
stage of building state sovereignty. We consider that economic 
advantage can be brought about only with ecological safety, 
and--therefore--our programmatic tasks comprise a solution of 
ecological problems by political methods. 
  We have a special "fondness" for nuclear problems. 
The decree passed by the Supreme Council on 21 October with 
regard to continuing the operation of the Chernobyl AES [Nuclear 
Power Plant] and repealing the moratorium on putting new 
nuclear-power generating facilities into operation attests to 
the fact that not a single step toward restructuring the economy 
has been taken. The government presently in power has chosen the 
most dangerous method for satisfying the hypertrophied needs and 
desires of an ineffective economic system. 
  We declare that the responsiblity for adopting decisions 
lies 
on all deputies, regardless of their party affiliations and 
declared views. The tragic experience of 1986 has taught 
Ukrainian leaders nothing. The Ukrainian state will be built, 
experience development, and then disappear from the face of the 
Earth, while the radioactive blot of plutonium will remain as a 
testimony to other places and states--a monument to the 
ignorance of a nation whose representatives we are. And so are 
the "Greens" not right to take such a stance with regard to 
nuclear problems? 
  Our attitude toward nuclear weapons is as follows. 
  We consider that nuclear weapons constitute a morally 
obsolete mode of settling world relations by violent methods. 
They simply must not be employed. And yet--at the same time--it 
is hard for the nuclear countries to give up their possession, 
whereas it is prestigious for non-nuclear countries to possess 
them. That is to say, to deprive them of having this type of 
weaponry in the very near future is quite problematical, 
regardless of any declarations to that effect. At the same time, 
however, the process of nuclear disarmament has been moved off 
dead center, and Ukraine's signing of the START Treaty bears 
witness to that. It is, undoubtedly, a serious step in the 
direction of our state's nuclear-free status. While advocating 
such a nuclear-free status, the "Greens" at the same time are 
fully aware of those problems which have arisen around this 
yearning. For dozens of years the Ukrainian people--just like 
all the peoples of the former USSR--worked for the 
military-industrial complex. As a result of the disintegration 
of the above-mentioned super-state, Ukraine did not inherit any 
of this. Having declared itself to be the rightful and legal 
successor of the USSR, Russia became the de facto heir to all 
the national wealth. And it is making an attempt to resolve its 
international obligations by means of the nuclear installations 
which have remained in Ukraine. It is exerting mad political 
pressure and distorting Ukraine's official position with regard 
to the problems of nuclear disarmament in the world community. 
Under such conditions the "greens" share in the idea that 
Ukraine must receive compensation for nuclear disarmament as 
well as guarantees from the nuclear countries. A failure to 
understand Ukraine's position on this matter, as well as 
attempts to exert political pressure from the Western countries 
for the purpose of solving their own security problems at the 
expense of a country which is beginning to build its own economy 
do not find support among Ukrainian "Greens." We have come out 
with an initiative to our foreign-relations departments 
regarding the discussion of the question of granting Ukraine the 
status of a permament member of the UN Security Council, as a 
status which is voluntarily renouncing nuclear weapons. This, to 
our way of thinking--together with granting the requests by the 
non-nuclear Germany and Japan to become members of the Security 
Council--could radically change the situation concerning the 
dominant concept of nuclear restraint, and it could begin a new 
phase in developing the world order. But, unfortunately, nobody 
has listened to us so far. 
  Our party has negatively assessed the changes introduced by 
the Supreme Council with regard to universal military 
obligation and military service. 
  The program for gradually professionalizing the Armed 
Services must provide as soon as possible for the introduction 
of an alternative type of military service, with guarantees of 
appropriate rights to all citizens of draftable age--a 
contractual system for those who have vocational or even 
professional training and are prepared to perform a term type of 
service. 
  Spirituality has assumed a particular importance 
during the present-day period. The rearing and education of 
whole generations of persons as conscious atheists has 
facilitated today's manifestations of cynical cruelty, a 
debauchery of evil-doing, and a criminalization of society. A 
lack of spirituality is the basic reason for the decline of 
cultural standards, for the lowered self-esteem of citizens, and 
for the degradation of the masses. Having set itself the task of 
humanizing society, the PZU will cooperate with all 
organizations--whether religious or secular--taking advantage of 
our own potentials because, of course, we have a significant 
persentage of teachers and doctors. That is to say, we have a 
genuine people's intelligentsia, which can be used to form a new 
consciousness, a consciousness of ecology and of harmonizing the 
relations between human beings and nature. 
  Our relations with other parties are as follows. 
Nowadays almost all parties declare their devotion to the ideas 
of centrism. Under such conditions all that we can do is to 
repeat the old "Green" slogan: "We are neither on the right or 
on the left; we are ahead of everybody." That is to say, under 
the Ukrainian conditions we are ahead of the center. During the 
period under review we have cooperated--sometimes quite 
constructively--with almost all the parties. We have not made 
enemies, but have rather won many friends. These include the 
Justice Party, with which we have conducted roundtables on 
topical questions and worked on an economic program for 
extricating ourselves from the present crisis. These friends 
also include the Ukrainian Republican Party, with which we have 
tried to assist Georgian refugees and with which we intend to 
conduct a Congress of the Political Parties of the Baltic and 
Black Sea Regions. These likewise include the PDVU [Party of 
Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine] and the Social Democrats. with 
which we have cooperated in the movement entiled "New Ukraine." 
These also include the Constitutional Democrats and the 
Liberals, with which we have worked on the draft of the 
Constitutional Assembly.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "The Republic Is Ready for </F>
Elections: And, According to Sociologists' Data, Not Ready for 
Withdrawal from the CIS"] 
  [Text] The Elections-94 independent press center has 
distributed the data of a sociological survey of 1,737 
respondents aged 18 and older which was conducted by the Kiev 
International Sociology Institute at the Kiev-Mogilyanskaya 
Academy in 183 villages, settlements, and cities of 24 oblasts 
of Ukraine, Kiev, and the Republic of Crimea. According to these 
data, to the question as to the direction in which Ukraine is 
currently headed, those responding that it is headed in the 
right direction constituted 7 percent in the cities, 10 percent 
in the villages, and 7 percent in Ukraine on average; the "don't 
knows" constituted 11, 15, and 13 percent respectively; those 
responding that Ukraine is moving in the wrong direction 
constituted 84 percent in cities, 74 percent in the villages, 
and 81 percent in Ukraine on average. 
  For the answer to the question as to which problem currently 
confronting Ukraine worries them the most, it was suggested that 
those polled choose three problems, and the answers were 
distributed as follows: 68 percent of those polled declared that 
they were worried most by the state of the economy, 39 percent, 
by relations with Russia, 35 percent, crime, 28 percent, 
Ukraine's security, 8 percent each the nuclear weapons situation 
and the Crimea problem, 6 percent, the position of Russian in 
Ukraine, and 5 percent, the Black Sea Fleet, and 4 percent of 
those polled either cited other problems or had no answer. 
  Sixty-five percent of those polled agree fully that it is 
necessary to acquire the right to private ownership of the land, 
only 9 percent disagree, and the rest are undecided. But only 29 
percent of those polled are sure that the ordinary people would 
benefit from the introduction of private ownership, 22 percent 
disagree, and the rest of have not made up their minds. It is 
hard to call these data anything other than a lack of confidence 
in the economic policy of present Kiev officialdom. And the 
following data are indicative with respect to the political 
course of the present leadership of Ukraine: To a question 
concerning the attitude toward the CIS, 79 percent of those 
polled declared that Ukraine should remain in the Commonwealth, 
10 percent, that it should quit the CIS, and 11 percent did not 
know. Concerning the economic union with the CIS, 75 of those 
polled responded that Ukraine should become a full member, 17 
percent, that it should remain an associate member, and 7 
percent, that it should quit the economic union, and 6 percent 
of those polled did not know. 
  More specifically concerning Ukrainian-Russian relations: 18 
percent of those polled declared that Ukraine and Russia should 
coexist as two totally independent states with closed borders, 
visas, and customs, and 39 percent of those polled declared that 
Ukraine and Russia should be fully independent, but friendly 
states--with open borders and without visas or customs. Forty 
percent of those polled declared that Ukraine and Russia should 
unite in one state, and only 3 percent are as yet undecided. The 
sociologists circumspectly did not inquire as to what had 
brought about this lamentable result of two years of Ukraine's 
independence. 
  Thirty-nine percent of those polled see Crimea as an oblast 
of Ukraine, 29 percent of those polled, as an autonomous 
republic within Ukraine, 27 percent, as an independent state, if 
this is what the people of Crimea want, and 12 percent did not 
know. 
  Some 51 percent of those polled advocated Russian as a 
second 
official language, 33 percent of those polled supported it as a 
second official language where this is what the public wants, 12 
percent support the complete elimination of Russian from 
official use, and 4 percent could not say. 
  Sixty-one percent of those polled declared that the Black 
Sea 
Fleet should be Ukrainian, and 18 percent, that it could be sold 
to Russia, and the rest either suggested other options or could 
not say. 
  Some 58 percent of those polled responded that they would 
take part in the parliamentary elections if they were held 
today, and 66 percent of those polled are prepared to turn out 
for the elections in the villages, and 54 percent in the cities, 
what is more. Twenty-nine percent of those polled would stay 
away, and a further 13 percent were undecided. 
  Of those who declared a readiness to take part in the 
elections, 5 percent named in response to the question of which 
present people's deputy they would like to see in the future 
parliament Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil. He was followed by 
Ivan Plyushch, speaker of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, with 4 
percent, former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma with 3 percent, 
Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, leader of the Democratic Party, and 
Volodymyr Hrynyov, leader of the New Ukraine association, with 2 
percent each, and Levko Lukyanenko, former ambassador of Ukraine 
in Canada, and Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party of 
Ukraine, with 1 percent each. The remaining 34 deputies named 
mustered less than 1 percent of the vote. 
  Some 69 percent of those polled found it difficult to name a 
modern political party of Ukraine for which they would vote were 
the forthcoming elections to be conducted by party slate, and of 
the 31 percent who named such parties, 10 percent supported 
Rukh, 9 percent, the Democratic Party, 7 percent, the Communist 
Party, and 2 percent, the Socialist Party, and the People's and 
Peasant Parties, the Ukrainian Justice Party, and the Green 
Party "garnered" 1 percent each. Among those who cited no party, 
40 percent of those polled declared that they simply could not 
recall the parties' names, and 37 percent, that they would be 
voting for nonparty candidates, and the rest found it hard to 
say. 
  It should be recalled in conclusion that there are 26 days 
remaining until the parliamentary elections in Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Saburov by unidentified </F>
NEZAVISIMOST correspondent under the rubric "Open Microphone"; 
place and date not given: "`The Supreme Council Decree Could Be 
Circumvented'"] 
  [Text] 
  [Saburov] Why mix economics and politics? It is 
incomprehensible to me. The decree adopted by the Ukraine 
Supreme Council hurts Kiev more than it does Simferopol. After 
all, circulation of the ruble in Crimea would be advantageous to 
Ukraine. But I am not certain the decree will be implemented in 
all its aspects. Pretexts can always be found. 
  [NEZAVISIMOST] Do your Moscow predictions coincide with what 
you found on the peninsula? Will prosperity for the Crimeans 
soon be attained? 
  [Saburov] My predictions coincide in the strategic sense. 
But 
many specific aspects I did not even imagine in Moscow have come 
up. Now my work will proceed in two directions--strategic 
(altering forms of ownership, taxation, etc.) and operational. 
  Reform is no joy in and of itself. And 1994 is not the most 
propitious year for transformations. First there was the 
freezing cold of November, then the lack of snow and very poor 
water accumulation. For Crimea these are very serious problems, 
fraught with additional adverse effects. 
  I will not dare to deceive people--we will not succeed in 
improving their lives over the short term. But we should work to 
benefit Crimea. To achieve this I am using all my Russian 
connections and the influence of friends back in the Russian 
Federation. 
  [NEZAVISIMOST] Seven of whom you have now carried away with 
you to Simferopol. 
  [Saburov] This is my great gift to Crimea. My "seven brave 
ones" are first-class experts in various spheres of the economy. 
Right now they are working on the Crimean budget that will be 
adopted after 11 March. 
  [NEZAVISIMOST] It is implied that these experts will exert a 
great influence on the work of the Saburov government. Do they 
include citizens of Ukraine? 
  [Saburov] They are all from Moscow, citizens of Russia. But 
several of them were born in Crimea or lived there a long time. 
  [NEZAVISIMOST] Has Yuriy Meshkov already settled the 
question 
of your citizenship? 
  [Saburov] The problem is still being resolved. Therefore, I 
will wait until the results are announced. 
  [NEZAVISIMOST] This is not the only problem. According to 
the 
Crimean Constitution, the president is the head of the 
government. You would hardly be able to occupy the post of prime 
minister proposed by Meshkov... 
  [Saburov] This prime minister business is just a joke. But I 
believe the position of prime minister is necessary--independent 
of the president. Its absence in the Crimean Constitution is a 
philological mistake that must either be removed or glossed over. 
  [NEZAVISIMOST] You have already become acquainted with 
officials of the Crimean Government and Nikolay Bagrov. Do you 
expect to be able to work harmoniously with them? 
  [Saburov] Nikolay Bagrov, like Yuriy Meshkov, has given me 
quite a warm reception and it would seem he has no intention of 
creating obstacles. His relationship with the president is far 
more strained. And one senses a slight aroma of sabotage in the 
"upper reaches" of the government. It is possible I will do a 
little personnel reshuffling in the leadership of the Council of 
Ministers. 
  [NEZAVISIMOST] In the opinion of experts, the political 
situation in Crimea will not permit you to carry out your 
planned reforms. 
  [Saburov] Indeed, the political situation in Crimea is not 
conducive to changes for the better. People are too politicized. 
Reforms will move forward to the degree that mass meeting 
activity is reduced. 
  [NEZAVISIMOST] Is it likely that thanks to cooperation with 
you, the first decrees of Yu. Meshkov will be economic ones? 
  [Saburov] I cannot tell the president where he should direct 
his first efforts. But I well remember when B. Yeltsin signed 
his first decree "On Education." The consequences dealt such a 
blow to the budget that to this day we have not managed to 
recover. I will try not to permit such "fine gestures" in Crimea. 
  [NEZAVISIMOST] But most likely you will allow ones "not so 
fine." Crimea will request more grants from Ukraine. 
  [Saburov] As I calculate it, Crimea cannot exist right now 
without Ukrainian grants. This is getting more expensive for 
Ukraine every year. The final amounts of 1994 assistance are 
being determined and will be presented for discussion in session 
of the Crimean parliament. 
  [NEZAVISIMOST] In the meantime, do you intend to return to 
Moscow? 
  [Saburov] I will leave Crimea in a few days. In Moscow I 
will 
work through the material I have collected and draft a program 
which will then be presented to Crimeans for their verdict. 
After that--I will wait to see how my status is determined.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Turchynov, chairman of the political </F>
and economic council of the Hromada All-Ukrainian Association: 
"A Shadow That Wants Into the Light. In Lieu of a Confession of 
a `Typical Businessman Engaged in the Shadow Economy'"] 
  [Text] "He who observes the wind will not sow; and he 
who regards the clouds will not reap." (Ecclesiastes 11:4) 
  The Hromada All-Ukrainian Association was created only 
two months ago, yet the press has already carried numerous 
articles, whose authors have focused their attention on one 
small element of our economic program -- i.e., the need to 
legalize Ukraine's shadow economy. In the process, some 
journalists are also reporting the "sensational" discovery that 
Hromada is striving to win power as the representative of the 
interests of those engaged in unauthorized economic activity. 
  In an attempt to meet all such "penetrating" authors 
halfway, let me try to elucidate some of our economic views 
through the prism of the legalization of the shadow economy. 
  There is no need to elaborate painstakingly on the economic 
situation in Ukraine. We are all quite familiar with the 
reigning atmosphere of bureacratic anarchy and administrative 
chaos, the fuel and energy crisis, the burden of direct and 
indirect taxes on enterprises that is beyond their ability to 
carry, and the various deductions from wages that have long 
since passed the 50-percent level. Add to this the 
hyperinflation that no one anticipated, the across-the-board 
drop in production, the legal jumble, the confiscation from 
exporters of 50 percent of their hard currency earnings in 
accordance with a fixed exchange rate made up by officials, and 
then put yourself in the place of an entrepreneur or enterprise 
director. 
  The novice entrepreneur's actions adhere to approximately 
the 
following pattern: he borrows capital at an exorbitant rate of 
interest, gives the bank his privatized apartment as security, 
pays a bribe to lease a shop, buys raw materials, hires 
employees, produces and sells finished production, and pays all 
his taxes and deductions to the state. Despite all of the 
state's efforts, he accomplishes the impossible -- he makes a 
profit. Wanting to make an official salary, the subject of our 
study must not orget to deduct from it the tax on profits. 
Beginning with the amount in excess of 50 official minimum wage 
rates, the profits tax rate is a mere 90 percent. Translated 
into real purchasing power, this "salary" then amounts to no 
more than the average Soviet engineer earned in the seventies. 
  Thus, the state as personified by the government, the 
National Bank, and the Supreme Council is destroying any 
economic rationale for the existence and growth of enterprise 
regardless of forms of ownership, and proposes to the 
entrepreneur that he accomplish a titanic, often very risky task 
in order to give back to the state 90 percent of his honestly 
earned and declared income. 
  Even assuming that owing of some mental aberration such an 
entrepreneur is found, he will be able to perform this trick 
only once or at most twice. That is because what the state does 
not take away officially, it will take away through 
hyperinflation as it tries to fill the bottomless holes in the 
budget through seigniorage -- namely, revenues obtained through 
monetary emission. Working capital is devalued, and there is no 
money to replace capital stock. This cycle can only be repeated 
in a decremental mode. 
  Adding to the prospect of inevitable collapse are the 
general 
decrease in production and the sharp drop in the people's 
purchasing power, which is causing a rapid shrinking of the raw 
materials market and product sales. Are the state and those whom 
it has an obligation to support (the nonproduction sphere, 
pensioners, invalids, etc.) growing richer by stripping hired 
workers, entrepreneurs, and enterprises in general of 
everything? Definitely not! 
  A state that has adopted a policy of openly robbing its own 
citizens has reached the point of economic absurdity: the more 
it takes, the less it gets. 
  The reason for this is simple. When resistance to robbery is 
not possible, there are only two alternatives left. The first is 
to give away all that one has and go begging. The second is to 
try and hide what one owns -- if not everything, then at least 
some portion of it. 
  In their struggle to survive, most enterprises and 
entrepreneurs choose the second way. They choose to conceal 
their economic activity from the state by engaging in what has 
been known since the days of developed socialism as the "shadow 
economy." But whereas those who set up shop in the seventies 
were driven into the shadows by the Criminal Code, our 
contemporaries have been driven into the shadows by economic 
expediency. It is important to distinguish between the 
"national" shadow economy and the traditional business of 
organized crime--trafficking in drugs, arms, people, 
prostitution, racketeering. These forms of activity are illegal 
in all civilized countries, and they have no direct link to the 
level of economic development attained by these countries. 
  Our state, on the other hand, with its inept tax, foreign 
trade, credit and finance, and investment policies is driving 
the overwhelming majority of enterprises into the shadows or 
forcing them to close. 
  How does the shadow economy work? Mainly, this entails 
hiding 
capital from the state's fiscal services and exporting it from 
the country. Countless variations have been worked out. These 
include unaccounted for cash transactions, disguising profits as 
production costs, deliberately withholding income from the sale 
of goods in "undeclared" accounts (for the most part located 
abroad), transferring the difference between the real and 
undervalued contractual price into private accounts, etc. There 
are hundreds of highly perfected financial schemes for 
concealing and exporting capital, specifically adapted to the 
way that banks, industrial enterprises, or agricultural concerns 
operate. 
  But it is not only traditional economic structures and the 
individuals who run their operations that are part of the shadow 
economy. Increasingly more private citizens, beginning with the 
children who wash cars in the street and ending with the 
veterans who sell their war medals, are easing to report their 
earnings to the state. At legal and illegal markets and 
"barakholky," millions of citizens sell a variety of goods -- 
ranging from contraband consumer goods to ficus plants grown on 
the balcony. For others, cottage industries and "moonlighting" 
have become a source of survival -- from knitting socks to 
building garages and summer dachas. But none of them -- from 
individuals with doctoral degrees who hold second jobs as night 
watchmen to professional beggars -- are in any hurry to stand in 
line to declare additional earnings to the tax inspectors. Thus, 
concealing from the state the kopecks they earn, they join the 
nationwide shadow economy in their struggle to survive. 
  One can now state with confidence that almost the entire 
economic infrastructure of the young independent state is bound 
up in a single shadow conglomerate. This shadow has now covered 
the whole of Ukraine! 
  One would think that it matters not what you call a chicken, 
as long as it lays eggs. Let our whole economy become a shadow 
economy, just so long as it works. But as all of us discover 
every day, the shadow economy is much too inefficient. 
  Capital cannot be kept in a cage that is convenient for 
officials. It is very active and will always move to where it 
can be most effectively used. It is especially apt to leave any 
space that is not suited to its existence. That is why capital 
is fleeing Ukraine, and where flight is impossible, it is being 
hidden in dark corners where the fiscal services cannot reach 
it. Huge amounts of illegally exported capital from Ukraine are 
now working to increase the prosperity of other countries, 
creating new jobs there and filling their markets with new 
products and services. This loss to Ukraine cannot be 
compensated by foreign credits, or by humanitarian aid, or by 
the sale of the Black Sea Fleet and nuclear missiles. 
  Another problem is that capital that circulates in the 
shadow 
economy cannot be used for large-scale investment in the means 
of production because this would immediately "bring it into the 
light." Saving profits that have been hidden from the state in 
the form of the national currency also makes no sense. Hence 
these funds are converted into convertible currencies and 
exported out of the country. Consequently, economic structures 
that rely on the shadow turnover of capital lack the opportunity 
for extensive capital renewal and generally show a tendency to 
fail. Moreover, unauthorized (cash) turnover is easiest for 
trade enterprises and small enterprises, while large industrial 
enterprises are forced to combine operating within the legal 
economy with illegal activities. In the case of large 
industries, the shadow component consists mostly of manipulating 
the difference between the sale price and the demand price, in 
"working" receipts (usually in hard currency) by retaining them 
on deposit accounts or by channeling them through more complex 
financial schemes. 
  But the shadow portion of such a mixed economy most often 
serves only the interests of the directors of large state 
enterprises and cannot compensate an enterprise's costs in the 
legal sector of the economy, where it has to officially pay its 
employees, service production, buy raw materials, and so on. 
That is why the majority of large enterprises have now been 
brought to a state of collapse by the state's economic policy. 
They are simply too large to be able to hide in the shadows 
(recall the fate of the dinosaurs when the climate deteriorated 
sharply). 
  The shadow economy engenders yet another very dangerous 
problem. It promotes the rapid growth and rising power of 
organized crime. 
  The ordinary, law-abiding citizen in our country, who has 
worked his entire life for the state, is helpless when faced by 
a criminal. However, he can draw attention to himself and turn 
to the state for protection. The citizen engaged in unauthorized 
economic activity does not have even this option available to 
him. Criminals know this, and as a result, instead of the tax 
inspectorate, those working in the shadows have to deal with 
racketeers. Criminal gangs are better versed in the laws of the 
market than their "colleagues" in the state apparatus. 
Consequently, only very rarely do they impose a 90-percent tax 
rate; they usually settle for 10 to 30 percent. 
  But we should not idealize the common sense of the shadow 
economy "inspectors." Sooner or later, the criminal world 
attempts to take over the whole "business." The alternative to 
this is very often the lethal end of the "shadow businessman." 
As a result, an active process of criminalizing the shadow 
economy is under way, a process of criminal "statization." This, 
in turn, sharply reduces the effectiveness of the shadow economy 
and raises the prices of finished products because of 
"additional" costs and the incompetence of the new owners. 
Ultimately, all of this makes the employees of such enterprises 
and the "free" entrepreneurs hostage to the plans of criminals. 
  Let us ask ourselves the traditional question: "Who gains 
from the economy being driven into the shadows?" First, 
organized crime is interested in having the state push the legal 
economy into the shadows, because the shadows are crime's 
traditional patrimony. 
  Second, today the interests of organized crime coincide 
objectively with a whole bouquet of interests of officialdom's 
ruling leadership, above all, because the harsh government 
regulation that is devastating the economy gives officials the 
power to dole out the beneficia they control: credit resources, 
currency, licenses, quotas, etc. 
  Furthermore, large-scale illegal export of capital is 
impossible without the "cover" provided by highly placed state 
officials, who "deservedly" become the partners of exporters. 
  The issuance of permits for temporary legal survival 
(namely, 
temporary exemptions from taxes or payment of customs duties) is 
also a profitable business. Nor does organized crime skimp on 
rewarding its "benefactors." A merging of the interests of the 
state's and organized crime's upper echelons is taking place. I 
have deliberately avoided using the term "mafia" in this 
article, because it has become so all-encompassing here that it 
is applied to everybody -- ranging from high officials knee-deep 
in corruption to small-time pickpockets. 
  In listing all the parties interested in the "shadowization" 
of the economy, we cannot ignore the real advantages obtained by 
Western countries, their banking and industrial structures, from 
the infusion into their economic systems of our financial, raw 
material, and professional potential. 
  Lastly, the political gains from the economic ruin being 
wreaked by the ex-Bolsheviks are being shared by our 
neo-Bolsheviks (Communists, Socialists and Co.). Inasmuch as, in 
addition to the complete discreditation of market reforms and 
the collapse of the economy, their "comrades" (former, to be 
sure) have also put business outside the law, creating a basis 
for widespread "revolutionary" dissatisfaction among the masses 
as well as the prospect of future legalized expropriations. 
  Therefore, if we are to talk of who is not interested in the 
"shadowization" of the economy, we need to point out that this 
group consists of all those entrepreneurs and enterprise 
directors for whom working in the shadows means constantly 
risking their lives, large additional expenses (protection, the 
cost of establishing accounts abroad, levies by officials and 
criminals, etc.), being excluded from the Ukrainian market, and 
having to constantly face the prospect of losing everything they 
have. Apart from them, of course, the shadow economy brings 
hunger, poverty, lawlessness, and coercion to the overwhelming 
majority of Ukraine's people. That is why those working in the 
shadows want to emerge "into the light" -- an outcome that would 
benefit everybody. 
  The left and right of various hues are bruiting around 
recipes for resolutely combatting the shadow economy. But 
inasmuch as today the term "shadow" has to be applied to 
practically every element of the conomic space of Ukraine, the 
slogan that results is "Fight the economy!". And this is 
something that the country's government has already been 
vigorously engaged in for the last few years. Thus, the 
substitution of one set of "warriors" with another will result 
in no more than an insignificant reassignment of official 
feeding troughs. 
  In my opinion, if we are truly serious about saving the 
economy, there is only one solution -- creating conditions to 
legalize it. Conditions, in which it would be profitable to 
invest capital in Ukrainian enterprises, profitable and safe to 
hold money on deposit in Ukrainian banks, conditions in which 
under a reasonable tax law it would be more expedient not to 
conceal income because the state would protect it rather than 
rob one of it. The recipe for legalization is simple and easily 
understood -- it is necessary to create better conditions for 
business in Ukraine than outside it, lower taxes, create a more 
conducive investment regime, remove restrictions on exports of 
finished products, put an end to the forced confiscation of 
earned foreign currency, etc. The public can learn more details 
about the ways to heal (legalize) the national economy by 
reading the program documents of Hromada, which holds one of its 
principal tasks to be to unite the healthy economic and 
political forces in our society in order to lead our economy out 
of the shadows and to check criminal-bureaucratic anarchy. That 
is why we want to "legalize shadow capital." 
  We are convinced that the creation of conditions for 
legalizing the economy is the only way to save Ukraine from the 
stifling shadow that has covered the country and is transforming 
every living thing in it into mouldy rot.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Panchenko: "A Chain Reaction to Acute </F>
Problems"] 
  [Text] Late last year, against the background of the 
continuously worsening energy crisis, the Supreme Soviet 
rescinded the moratorium on introducing new capacities at the 
republic's atomic power plants which it had adopted in August 
1990. But the belated correction of the mistake was unable to 
improve the situation in power engineering. Moreover, in 
February practically all of Ukraine's AES's [nuclear electric 
power plant] experienced a shortage of nuclear fuel. The 
Zaporozhye AES had to "unload," that is to say lower, the output 
of two units so that they could work through this year. The same 
thing is happening at the Chernobyl and South Ukraine 
plants. 
  Russia must be paid almost 50 billion rubles for 
nuclear fuel elements. And no one knows how much the scarce 
equipment for the units that have been brought back up at the 
Rivno and Khmelnitskiy AES's costs now. Generally the problems 
here are purely economic ones, but some deputies have not ceased 
their attempts to blame Yeltsin and his government for our 
troubles. Such a stand can only aggravate the crisis. For our 
main enemy is ourselves. The populism, unprofessionalism, and 
indifference of the parliamentarians and government bureaucrats 
costs taxpayers too much. 
  It is not impossible that on the threshold of the 
elections, some candidates for deputy will again try to play the 
nuclear card. Voters should know what all this hysteria and 
incompetence can cost all of us if this history repeats 
itself. 
<H5>  The Reverse Side of the Moratorium </H5>
  The antinuclear euphoria on the shores of the Dnepr reached 
a 
peak in the summer of 1990. The republic was declared a hostage 
of the atomic department of the former Union. The Communist 
Party of Ukraine and communist deputies in parliament supported 
the idea of a moratorium. 
  Hotheads who were superficially familiar with the problem 
and 
did not inconvenience themselves with proof assured the people 
very emotionally that Ukraine would get along without AES's, 
that if all the plants were closed no one would notice. 
  And the fact that 14 energy units with a total capacity of 
12.8 million kilowatts are in operation at the 5 Ukrainian AES's 
and that in 1990 they provided about one-third of all the 
electricity produced in the republic was not taken into account. 
Today atomic power plants bear 40 percent of the load. 
  Certain scientists and the minister of energy at that time, 
Vitaliy Sklyarov, threw oil on the fire by trying to convince 
everyone that Ukraine should build gas turbine-powered heat 
plants rather than nuclear energy units. But what do you burn at 
such plants? Ukraine satisfies 24 percent of its gas needs and 8 
percent of its oil needs through its own production. And there 
are depressing forecasts that this situation will get worse. But 
we can be supplied with uranium for centuries. 
  These and other facts were published in the press at the 
time 
and rang out from the rostrum of the Supreme Soviet, but the 
opinion of the specialists was not heeded. World experience was 
also ignored. After all, France, with which people love to 
compare Ukraine, produces 75 percent of its electricity at AES's 
and, strange as it may seem, the French do not consider 
themselves hostages of the nuclear monster. 
  Ukraine passed its peak of electricity production in 1988 
(297.2 billion kilowatt hours). Since that time we have only 
been lowering its production. There are two reasons for that: 
first, half of the equipment of the heat plants have depleted 
their service lives and need to be replaced. Secondly, the 
extraction of energy media dropped both in Russia and in 
Ukraine, but the prices for them increased. So last year the 
republic was short 50 billion kilowatt hours as compared with 
1988. But while the TES's [thermal electric power plants] reduce 
production, AES's increase it every year. If not for the nuclear 
units, back in the winter of 1991 Ukraine would have had to 
introduce a scheduled energy delivery. 
  The symptoms of the disaster which has now begun were more 
than obvious back at the time the decision on the moratorium was 
adopted. It was also obvious that Ukraine could not do without 
atomic energy--only uranium could really alleviate the shortage 
of organic fuel. But even so the construction of AES's was 
terminated. 
<H5>  You Have To Pay for Everything </H5>
  I am certain that the decision on the moratorium was adopted 
without a serious economic expert study. If the deputies had 
known the facts and figures cited below, everything would not 
have happened so readily and smoothly. 
  So, in 1990 three million-watt units with VVER-1000 
[water-moderated water-cooled] reactors which were not inferior 
to similar Western ones in terms of safety were under 
construction at the Zaporozhye, Rivno, and Khmelnitskiy AES's. 
The cost of each one was a billion dollars. With international 
prices for electricity at 6-7 cents per kilowatt hour, one year 
of moratorium costs the country 500 million dollars. It is easy 
to figure the direct losses, but the republic's actual losses 
are much greater. 
  By putting up a barrier in the path of AES's, the Supreme 
Soviet automatically terminated the development of high 
technologies in Ukraine. For an atomic energy unit is the result 
of the activity of dozens of scientific and production 
collectives. The latest achievements of science and technology 
are applied in designing and building it. In one moment they 
became useless. 
  The construction workers were the first to begin to 
disperse. 
Then it was the turn of the operating personnel of the AES's 
themselves. Highly qualified specialists, most of them young, 
immediately understood that the moratorium would put an end to 
their careers in Ukraine. No new units, no growth. And the 
wages? In Russia a control operator earns 300 dollars a month 
converted into hard currency, but at the Zaporozhye AES it is 
one-tenth that. 
  A moratorium was imposed in our country, but Russia began to 
launch its own nuclear energy program. Recruiters began to work 
at Energodar and other AES's of Ukraine. They not only offered 
the needed people a decent wage but even apartments. The 
professionals whose training takes from 3 to 5 years began to 
pack their suitcases. And not just one or two but by brigades 
and shifts. Last year alone 325 people left the Zaporozhye GRES 
[state regional electric power plant], and about 400 left the 
atomic power plant! 
  Recently the director of the Zaporozhye AES, Vladimir 
Bronnikov, announced that if the exodus of specialists is not 
stopped, there will be simply no one to run Unit No 6. And will 
other units become safer if novices sit at the control panel? 
  The overall collapse of industry has also had an effect on 
the safety of atomic power plants. The moratorium forced plants 
producing equipment for AES's to seek other orders, do simpler 
things. The quality control system was destroyed and specialists 
left. As a result many enterprises can no longer supply 
equipment which meets the demands of atomic power engineering. 
Ukraine is declining as a high technology country. 
  So the goals declared by the advocates of the moratorium 
were 
not achieved. Just the opposite. AES safety declined and 
electricity production dropped. In the frozen units not only was 
an enormous amount of capital and past labor paralyzed, but 
every day they required considerable expenditures to maintain 
and guard them. Ukraine's sick economy had a shortfall of 
billions of dollars. All these streamlets of wastefulness and 
irresponsibility made up the river of present-day inflation and 
economic collapse. 
<H5>  Courage Is the Lot of the Wise </H5>
  The fact that the moratorium accomplished nothing but harm 
was already clear in the fall of 1991. Even Zaporozhye Oblast, 
which has three very large power plants, Dneproges [Dnepr 
Hydroelectric Power Plant], a GRES, and an AES, with a total 
capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts, had an energy 
shortage at that time. Two of 18 ovens were in operation at 
Dneprospetsstal [Dnepr Special Steel] and the aluminum combine 
ceased production of silicon and thereby shut down dozens of 
enterprises of Ukraine's electrical and radio engineering 
industry. Let me remind you that this was 1991. 
  In 1992 the situation got even more complicated. The 
appeals, 
verbal and written, of the directors of the industrial 
enterprises and power stations to the state's leaders did not 
yield results. The parliament, with stubbornness that should 
have been put to better use, stood its own. True, some of the 
deputies understood the mistake, but most did not have enough 
courage to acknowledge it from the rostrum. 
  But in the lobbies people suggested to the directors of 
AES's 
that they appeal to the government. Let it by its decree (since 
it had the authority) rescind our decision. This shameful 
haggling continued for a year! And only when the economy, and 
she is a stern mistress in all respects, finally turned her back 
on us did the people's chosen ones deign to do anything. 
<H5>  What Is Ahead! </H5>
  The moratorium was rescinded, but the problems it created 
were not. The collective of the Zaporozhye AES is preparing to 
launch Unit No 6. In fact this will be done in the coming 
months. As for the reactors at the Rivno and Khmelnitskiy power 
plants, there are more questions than answers. 
  In actuality, by 1990 the basic construction work in 
Energodar was complete. The Zaporozhye workers provided No 6 
with all the equipment, and despite the moratorium completed 
installation at their own risk and prevented the unit from 
collapsing for 3 years. People simply did not want to sink a 
billion dollars into the sand, and, it is true, no one even said 
thanks for this. 
  Construction was not completed on the units at the Rivno and 
Khmelnitskiy AES's and all the equipment was not supplied. Now 
it will have to be collected in all the countries of the near 
abroad or production will have to be set up in Ukraine. It is 
frightening to even speak of how much this is going to cost. 
Specialists estimate that with strong state support, the units 
could provide current in 1995-1996. But there can be no talk of 
any support while the Ministry of Power Engineering owes the 
Zaporozhye AES alone more than 30 billion karbovantsy for energy 
already produced. Where can money be gotten when Ukraine owes 
everyone? So the future of these units is very hazy and 
uncertain. 
  The future of Ukraine's power engineering system is just as 
hazy. The point is that even now the independent state does not 
have a scientifically substantiated program of actions 
reinforced with real resources for the sector as a whole or for 
atomic energy in particular. 
  And meanwhile Ukraine's power engineering system continues 
to 
fall into the abyss. Because of the shortage of fuel, the output 
of the Zaporozhye GRES, the largest in Europe, has dropped to 
two-thirds its former level. The situation in the other heat 
plants is no better either. In turn, because of the shortage of 
electricity, many industrial enterprises have sharply reduced 
production, or even stopped it, and in some cities of the 
republic electricity is supplied to the population by schedule. 
  Is this really the kind of life we want?

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Kozoriz, Rural Renewal Department, Tel.: </F>
441-82-03: "What Will Happen To Our Own Stalingrad?"] 
  [Text] You have probably noticed that since MOLOD UKRAYINY 
took Ukraine's agroindustrial complex under its patronage, there 
have been substantial changes in this sector. "The rate of 
decline of agricultural production has decreased significantly. 
Compared with last year, gross agricultural production decreased 
only two percent, while field-crop output increased seven 
percent." This diagnosis was made by the Ministry of Statistics 
of Ukraine in its report on the socioeconomic situation in 
Ukraine in 1993. 
  We were pleased to learn of this, particularly because this 
was not our only contribution in the agricultural sector. For 
example, heeding our request, the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food replaced the massive oak doors at its main entrance with 
light Duralumin ones. This reform was no small thing. As I 
opened these doors one day, I unexpectedly ran into Borys 
Yosypovych Kyrychenko, the head of the Main Administration for 
Foreign Economic Relations of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food. No sooner had I said hello than Borys Yosypovych invited 
me into his office for a cup of tea (if only everyone was this 
hospitable). As we drank our tea, I asked him an important 
question: what is happening in the agrosector as far as foreign 
investments are concerned? In light of the heightened interest 
in this issue among the general public, I offer the readers a 
synopsis of the answer that I received to this question from 
Borys Yosypovych Kyrychenko. 
  1. Our agrarian complex depends on the West for some two 
billion dollars in production resources. This money is spent to 
buy veterinary medicines, chemicalization means, spare parts, 
packaging materials, etc. In other words, it costs two billion 
dollars just to keep the agroindustrial complex [APK] 
functioning. To enable us to bring it closer to the level of the 
agrosectors in Western countries, we would need an additional 
four to five billion dollars. If we had this money, in three to 
four years we could increase the export potential of farm 
products to 10 billion dollars. The problem is that we cannot 
get this kind of start-up capital from anyone. They have no 
confidence in us. 
  2. It would be naive to count on receiving investments from 
Washington as we once received capital investments from Moscow. 
We need to take a more realistic view of things. We are 
currently in the midst of an economic war. While our ancestors 
began fighting by throwing rocks, then moved on to bows, and 
finally developed nuclear weapons, the weapon in the economic 
war is the dollar. The side with more dollars is always 
stronger. Economic wars may be less savage than military 
conflicts, but the results are the same -- the invasion of the 
other side's economy. That is why the stage in which our economy 
is today can be compared to 1941-43. Only we have not yet dug in 
on our own Volga, near our own Stalingrad. We still have no 
Marshall Zhukov who would know how to stop the retreat. We do 
not yet have our own Stalin's decree: "Not another step back." 
And we do not know what will happen to our own Stalingrad. 
  3. There is great interest in Ukraine in the world 
community. 
Not only because it has the most fertile black soil in Europe. 
For example, we sow almost as much corn as the whole of Western 
Europe. How much we reap is another matter. We underrate our 
agrarian potential, while Western businessmen know its value. 
  Ukraine could build her whole economy on sugar, sunflowers, 
and wheat. If our work met the standards of Western countries, 
we could easily export close to 20 million metric tons of grain, 
approximately 5 million metric tons of sugar, and almost one 
million metric tons of sunflower oil. Moreover, at below 
world-level prices, because production costs in our country are 
significantly lower and our labor force is cheaper. This is 
humiliating, but in today's situation it also gives us an 
advantage. On the one hand, these factors attract those who want 
to make money in Ukraine, while, on the other hand, the 
competitiveness of our products in the world market scares 
Western businessmen. 
  4. The agrarian sector can assure the country the necessary 
supplies of oil products. But to do so, we need to set aside 
three million of our 43 million hectares of land and use the 
income from this area to purchase oil. We need to create special 
companies, which could be organized into consortiums that would 
produce farm goods, the proceeds from which would go to buy oil. 
We would thus not need to look for other financial resources to 
pay for fuel. We could also solve the problem of rural 
investments at the expense of our agrarian potential. But this, 
too, requires start-up capital. 
  5. In the past year, our agriculture with large private 
firms 
[as published] received 120-130 million dollars in short-term 
credits. As a rule, these loans are extended for sowing with the 
expectation that a profit will be made that the fall. Last year, 
as part of such joint ventures, we grew sugar beets, sunflowers, 
and corn on an area covering 300,000 hectares. 
  There are close to 70 joint enterprises in Ukrainian 
agriculture, of which 22 are engaged in production, 36 in trade, 
and the remainder are at the stage of being established. 
  Among the foreign companies that are in partnership with our 
structures in the agroindustrial complex, Polish, Czech, and 
Hungarian companies predominate numerically, while American, 
German, and Italian firms lead in terms of the amounts of 
capital invested. No one is asking who the winner will be [as 
published]. At this stage, the most active are the Americans, 
later, perhaps, the Germans may lead, although not every company 
represents national or state interests. Today, the interests of 
the transnational corporations dominate. For example, the 
Tetrapak company, which is manufacturing packaging for milk 
products in our country, is registered in Great Britain, but the 
company's president, Hans Rausing, is a Swede. Why in Great 
Britain? Because the tax rate is lower there. 
  6. Foreigners are being frightened away by our unstable 
laws. 
When they were first passed, they were exceptionally 
advantageous for foreign investors. Later some of these laws 
were fundamentally changed. Also the mechanism of settling 
accounts with foreign partners has not been thoroughly worked 
out, and double taxation makes the production of goods for 
export unprofitable. These are the reasons that our agrarian 
rating has fallen significantly in the world. 
  7. And lastly. Capital flows where there are profits to be 
made. It is not possible to hold it with political actions. If a 
businessman figures out that he can make money on Ukrainian 
sunflower oil, he will bring his investment to Ukraine. These 
are our trump cards. But one can lose even while holding a good 
hand of trumps. Everything depends on the skill with which the 
game is played. 
  Incidentally, apropos trump cards. Just as this material was 
going into print, the State Program To Encourage Foreign 
Investment in Ukraine was published unexpectedly. 
Characteristically, the agroindustrial complex was included in 
the priority sphere for investment along with other sectors of 
the national economy. The program provides for the introduction 
of highly productive farm technologies, the refurbishment and 
modernization of food processing enterprises, the development of 
the agricultural machine-building industry, etc. In a word, 
exactly the things that we lack at present. Therefore, despite 
the pessimistic notes sounded by Borys Kyrychenko in his 
prognosis, there is room for optimism. We need only add that the 
Law "On the State Program To Encourage Foreign Investment in 
Ukraine" will come into force on 1 March 1994. Let us wait, 
shall we?

<F P=106> [Article by A. Starikevich: "Belarus: Back Into the USSR"] </F>
  [Text] The five-year mandate of republic authorities 
is expiring. Everyone in a leadership position wants to catch 
the next train, including those who are responsible for the 
Belarusian train finding itself on a siding. 
<H3>  Maneuvers of the Communist Party of Belarusia after August 
1991 </H3>
  The political landscape characteristic of 1990 - 1991 has 
actually been preserved in Belarusia. Most of the power belongs 
to a formation which is frequently called a party of the Council 
of Ministers. That is not quite correct inasmuch as it is really 
an officially totally unsanctioned association consisting of the 
former communist nomenklatura which retained positions in the 
republic leadership. The Council of Ministers here appears as 
one of the components, nothing more. 
  The events of August 1991 forced the Communist Party into a 
castling move by transferring the main levers of power to the 
government. It is important to note that at that time the 
parliament and the government were merely appendages of the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarusia. The 
Central Committee ceased to exist and was replaced by the 
Council of Ministers. Naturally, government leaders immediately 
announced their resignation from the party. Thus an impression 
was created that the Communist Party has been removed from 
power. That allowed some to assume key roles and others to 
temporarily move into the shadows, while retaining power en 
masse. 
  At present the Council of Ministers in essence is the sole 
active branch of power in the republic. The government lobby in 
parliament has a sufficient number of votes in order to control 
the situation. Its backbone consists of the "Belarus" group of 
deputies which formed in the fall of 1991 on the basis of the 
communist faction. Its members prefer not to advertise their 
pro-communist views. The faction of the People's Movement of 
Belarusia (NDB), which unified the "Soyuz" deputy group, the 
factions of veterans and the party of communists of Belarusia, 
that was formed in November 1993, is an ally of "Belarus." Most 
of its members were elected from public organizations (veteran 
and invalid societies). NDB does not conceal its pro-communist 
orientation and is distinguished by particular aggressiveness 
directed against practically any kind of a democratic 
transformation. 
  Democratic organizations are represented in parliament by 
the 
Belarusian People's Front faction. Its activities are tinged by 
rigid anti-communist and anti-imperialist views. The opposition 
is from time to time joined by those with centrist viewpoints 
from the Party of National Consent and the Belarusian 
Social-Democratic Hromada. But even together at best they are 
capable of only blocking the adopted decisions (particularly 
those requiring a constitutional majority). In regular elections 
those holding centrist positions will more than likely have to 
be content with an insignificant number of mandates while the 
main harvest will be reaped by communists and the Belarusian 
People's Front. 
  But who knows when the elections will take place meanwhile 
it 
is necessary to live today. After the resignation of Stanislav 
Shushkevich a situation formed where all of the key posts and 
structures came under control of the former nomenklatura, 
including the powerful ministries, which was so fervently 
desired for so long by the government. The piquancy of the 
situation is that it is still uncertain whether Shushkevich's 
resignation did more good than harm for the government. The 
former speaker was so well suited for the role of the main 
culprit responsible for all the troubles. It appears that in 
getting rid of him the nomenklatura was guided not by logic but 
by social instincts. As a result of that the government lost its 
screen and became a candidate for the job of the one responsible 
for everything. 
  At the same time benefits derived from the resignation of 
the 
speaker are very doubtful. Yes, now the Council of Ministers and 
Supreme Council are under full control of the former 
nomenklatura, and the fist, which consists of the government, 
the parliament, and the communists, appears sufficiently 
powerful. According to all the signs, however, this wonderful 
association can expect a thrashing in the very near future. New 
head of the parliament Mechaslav Grib, who formerly did not lay 
any claim to independence and certainly not to a position of 
leadership, now, it seems, considers himself a figure at the 
very least as powerful as Kebich. He is starting to put together 
his team. It is true, his first forays among the people (in 
drugstores and at kolkhoz meetings) were such tortured affairs, 
done very clumsily. 
  The communists also might feel themselves unsatisfied. All 
they have gotten out of this government up to now was several 
positions of secondary importance in executive power structures. 
At the same time it is not clear with whom the Council of 
Ministers officials will be entering the forthcoming elections 
since they no longer have their own party and its successor, the 
party of communists of Belarusia, has a sufficiently stable 
electorate, approximately the same one which is being claimed by 
the government. It is not precluded that the communists will not 
wish to share votes and on the eve of the elections will attempt 
to sink everyone they can, both the parliament and the 
government. 
  Kebich's positions, however, are not as strong as many 
believe. If the erected framework for the unification of 
monetary systems collapses, it is rather doubtful that the 
premier will be able to get out from under its ruins. A lot of 
those will immediately be found who are willing to demonstrate 
for Kebich the difference between the status of a first 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
Belarusia and a head of government. At the same time the 
question regarding the premier will sooner or later still appear 
on the agenda even in case the unification does take place. 
There is no doubt that Kebich will attempt to utilize such a 
success in order to conduct presidential elections in its light 
and occupy the heights unattainable for his opponents. But would 
such a variant suit his present allies? They will have ample 
opportunity in order to outmaneuver Kebich. After all a decision 
has not even been adopted yet concerning introduction of the 
post of president in the republic of Belarus. 
<H5>  A Government Without a Program </H5>
  The phenomenon of the Belarusian government consists of the 
fact that in four years of its existence it is yet to carry out 
any transformations particularly since it never had anything 
even remotely resembling an economic program. Having received a 
relatively prosperous republic, compared to its neighbor, it 
systematically brought it to near collapse and is now lamenting 
over a broken trough. All attempts by the Council of Ministers 
to inject itself into the economic sphere, as a rule, ended in 
disgraceful failures. The introduction of single-use coupons may 
serve as an example of that. Since then that is how they exist: 
the government on its own and the economy on its own as well. 
The culprit in all of this, of course, is the former chairman of 
the Supreme Council, but a month has already passed since his 
departure without any noticeable changes, even microscopic ones. 
  The reasons for such a state of affairs are seen in the fact 
that following the disintegration of the USSR a kind of power 
vacuum formed in the republic. Until then members of the local 
nomenklatura elite felt quite comfortable in the role of 
deputies of Moscow. Their main privilege was the possibility of 
not having to think since that was taken care of in the capital 
city. In the fall of 1991 the executives faced the need to make 
decisions. They had the power, but what to do with it was 
incomprehensible. 
  Perhaps that problem could have been resolved but the 
Communist Party had met its demise somewhat earlier. The former 
nomenklatura lost a powerful structure which made it possible to 
govern the state. At the same time it is genetically incapable 
of adapting to the new conditions. 
  Today Belarusian leadership is not a master of the 
situation, 
but a hostage of the situation which has formed and which it is 
powerless to change. Unfortunately this period of disintegration 
could continue for a very long time. In the meanwhile the 
communist doctrine, which has failed everywhere in the world, 
remains as the guiding star of Belarusian nomenklatura. Many of 
its representatives see a return to the past as the solution. It 
is not by accident that the "Belarus" group and the communist 
organizations favor the denunciation of Belovezh agreements. 
Having failed the test in reorganization of the economy, the 
government is attempting to rectify the situation once again 
shifting its problems to the shoulders of someone else. This 
time to the shoulders of Russia. At their noisy meetings the 
loyal Leninists repeatedly declared that they regard the 
republic as a springboard for revenge on the scale of the Soviet 
Union. Therefore if Russia agrees to carry the load of 
Belarusian economic problems, it will acquire a rather difficult 
ideological burden as well.

<F P=106> [Interview, under the rubric "Problems: A Meeting for You," </F>
with Nikolae Bivol, chief of the financial guard under the 
Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Moldova, conducted by 
Gennadiy Skvirenko; date and place not given] 
  [Text] Just what kind of a structure is it, this 
financial guard? 
  And who are the financial guards? 
  Something like a modern-day "oprichnina" [Ivan the 
Terrible's palace guard]? Or something just as essential to 
civilized society as air traffic, highway regulations, or 
convertible currency? 
  That, along with many other things, is the subject of 
our interview with Nicolae Bivol, the chief of the financial 
guard under the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of 
Moldova. 
<H5>  A Quick-Response Unit? </H5>
  [Skvirenko] These days the financial guard is rumored to be 
just like the OBKhSS [Department for Combating the Embezzlement 
of Socialist Property and Speculation] once was. But, to the 
best of my knowledge, it is a new organization and is involved 
in something new. Please explain what is going on here. 
  [Bivol] Let us begin by saying that there has never been 
such 
an organization before, since there could not have been because 
there were no such violations like those we work on. What 
benefit could a socialist enterprise gain from evading taxes, 
for example? 
  [Skvirenko] None. 
  [Bivol] Of course! Let us compare present-day income and the 
former bonuses and, most importantly, let us consider where they 
come from and where they used to come from. Both come... from 
profits. So hiding profit did not make sense before; there would 
not even have been bonuses. A different type of violation 
existed, if you remember, account padding. 
  But now? Now everything is different. Profits are concealed, 
and income too. And they are tens and hundreds of times more 
sensitive than the former bonuses. That is what gives the 
actions of our present-day "clients" their logic. 
  [Skvirenko] So you kind of add this quick response unit onto 
the tax inspection service? 
  [Bivol] And then too, we work on operational monitoring of 
compliance with customs laws, track contraband... And, of 
course, we protect consumers' rights--we fight against the 
illegal practice of overpricing. 
  [Skvirenko] So it is something new, and drastic too. Your 
first assignment must really stick in your mind. 
  [Bivol] And the first lessons that it taught us? Yes, that 
is 
true. But the first assignment was a commercial store. And the 
first lesson was the awareness of our complete inability to do 
anything. We requested the documents; there were no documents. 
We wanted to know whose goods they were; "The goods are my own." 
And that was it. And no one knew what to do then. We conducted 
two or three such miserable inspections, and then I went to 
request that an edict be published on our service. The draft of 
the edict was prepared, and it was lost somewhere. A second 
draft was prepared and was sent to the president's secretariat. 
And there I was given the edict after exactly one week. True, 
there were strong objections to this document in parliament 
then, but to be frank, in that particular parliament, I mean in 
view of its particular make-up, the idea of a financial guard 
could certainly not find support. And although they could not 
stop it, certain traces still remain in the document. 
  [Skvirenko] Which ones? 
  [Bivol] Well, for example, instead of a provision on 
confiscation of illegal goods, there is a vague statement on 
their detention. But personally I believed and continue to 
believe that if goods which are not certified with documents and 
whose legal origin cannot be proven are found at an economic 
agent, those goods must be removed and confiscated for state 
income. Incidentally, in most countries that is precisely the 
type of procedure which operates. And gives pretty good results. 
  [Skvirenko] Just how do you get out of the situation? 
  [Bivol] We tossed around what to do with the detained goods 
and decided to seize them and fine the economic agent. He pays 
the fine, he gets the goods. 
  [Skvirenko] Do they pay? 
  [Bivol] Without blinking an eye! 
  [Skvirenko] But later they add this fine onto the price of 
the goods. And it turns out that ultimately we punish the 
consumer. 
  [Bivol] That is partly true. But only partly, since the 
buyer 
knows how to count and people simply will not buy anything from 
someone who jacks the price up more than others. But the main 
thing is that we must certainly do something, and we must start 
somewhere. Now we have prepared one more draft edict on bringing 
people to account for economic violations. Many of the 
provisions in it look much more well-grounded. 
  [Skvirenko] For example? 
  [Bivol] For example, where should dividends from our capital 
invested in joint ventures created either on Moldova's territory 
or outside its borders be accounted for? There are no such 
accounting records. And in general who can tell how much capital 
has left Moldova for other countries, especially Romania, 
Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus? No one can tell. But if there were 
a mechanism for monitoring this sphere of activity, not only 
could we answer all these questions, but we would not for 
anything let our state be hurt. 
<H5>  The Weakest Spot </H5>
  [Skvirenko] In our country the mechanisms, both in the 
economy and in politics, are the weakest spot. 
  [Bivol] That is true. But to be specific, we lack the most 
fundamental thing which economic agents need. 
  There is no Law on Accounting. There is no Business Code. 
And, finally, as yet there is no Law on Declaration of Income. 
  So it seems that no one clearly knows how, on what, or where 
to keep records. No one can accurately distinguish a case of 
buying and selling from an export or import transaction. And no 
one, although we have been floating and even already drowning in 
a free economy for a long time, no one declares his income. Take 
for example the Administrative Code. It meticulously notes down 
the type of punishment envisioned for taking the trolley without 
a ticket or walking a dog in the wrong place. But why not, in 
the sphere of economics too, add the good idea of permitting 
everything that is not prohibited and add a precise list of what 
in fact is prohibited? I assure you that it would take no more 
than 20-30 points, but then not only could we appeal for order, 
we could really fight for it. 
  [Skvirenko] Unfortunately, many provisions are written in 
such a way that they obscure rather than illuminate the essence 
of the matter. 
  [Bivol] That is certainly true. In 1992 a legislative 
enactment was adopted which says that if an economic agent 
carries out illegal economic activity or an operation without 
the necessary license, then the profit obtained from this type 
of activity is recovered from him--as punishment! 
  I am sure that we will not find one case in the last 2 years 
in all of Moldova where this sanction was applied. And all 
because it is tied to profits which can easily be concealed in 
the common pot of this structure's activity. 
  [Skvirenko] But what should it have been tied to? 
  [Bivol] Revenue from the illegal economic activity itself 
must be recovered. And if any of the output produced is left, it 
must also be confiscated. That would be the right way. 
Otherwise, commercial structures will always have altogether 
unfair advantages over state structures. 
  [Skvirenko] The advantages of "muddy waters"? 
  [Bivol] Absolutely right. For what happens? Violations of 
economic laws have become epidemic; more than 75 percent of all 
economic agents are guilty of this! 
  [Skvirenko] But aren't you afraid that organized crime in an 
already fairly developed form is behind all this, in the 
background, so to speak? 
  [Bivol] Yes, that fear does occur to me. 
  [Skvirenko] Where does it come from? 
  [Bivol] From elementary facts. For example: the organs of 
power, which are always calling upon people to observe the laws, 
themselves for some reason do not observe them. That is to say, 
they themselves are constantly establishing exceptions for some 
person and for some reason. 
  [Skvirenko] And are there a lot of such exceptions now? 
  [Bivol] Enough. Last year the total number of economic 
sanctions imposed by the financial guard equaled 3.2 billion 
coupon rubles. At the same time, however, many economic agents 
were exempted from our sanctions by various directives "as an 
exception," for a total of more than half a billion rubles. 
  [Skvirenko] Were these "amnesties" not always justified? 
  [Bivol] Above all the very practice of making any exceptions 
was in no way justified. You want to change the law? Introduce 
an amendment. But the very effect of the law and of the 
amendment must be the same for everyone. Otherwise, there is no 
such thing as economic space. And so what has happened in our 
country? Let us say there was an edict on in-kind tax. There was 
an uproar over it: if farms do not hand over as much meat, 
grain, and other products as is suggested, we will punish them 
with fines. 
  So first we were criticized for not imposing fines. But when 
we began to fine the guilty, they went and published an edict so 
that this sanction would not be applied in the future. Do you 
sense the, to put it mildly, awkward situation? And now a 
document is being prepared by which the fines collected before 
will be returned to the "victims." 
  [Skvirenko] Then why was this whole long procedure 
undertaken 
at all? To "trip up" the financial guard? 
  [Bivol] I am most touched when a letter exempting a firm 
from 
the fine cites the reason: such-and-such firm has done a great 
deal for the republic. So just what has it done? Maybe it has 
supplied something, imported something else. Pardon me, but we 
have state structures which are supposed to both supply and 
import. And if they cannot handle this work, then let us either 
reform them or ask the more efficient managers of the 
independent structures to head our inefficient state structures! 
<H5>  Don't Do It Better, Do It Right </H5>
  [Skvirenko] But on the other hand, while we used to be 
called 
the "country of the soviets," now we can certainly be called the 
"country of the edicts." Is every edict dictated by the desire 
to do something better? 
  [Bivol] You know,, the word "better" is sometimes quite 
dangerous. Better for whom? Better how? Better at whose expense? 
If something should in fact be an exception, then there is the 
edict. But economic agents must operate under exactly the same 
conditions and in a unified economic space for all. And then in 
competition they will begin to do better and to work more 
efficiently, and that means that as a result we will all be 
better off. I repeat over and over: a good legislative mechanism 
is the only thing that will save us. 
  [Skvirenko] All the same, what factors of this mechanism 
should definitely be singled out? 
  [Bivol] The idea of the mechanism is to untie the hands of 
economic agents, both state and nonstate agents, as much as 
possible. And among other things that means that first prices 
must be freed and licensing and barter must be eliminated, 
especially barter since it is the main channel for abuses. A 
market economy must be built on the base of buying and selling, 
for lei and for hard currency. To do this, of course, banks must 
operate efficiently, credit transactions must be carried out, 
and the securities market must operate. But a reliable 
convertible leu must be the heart of everything. Can you imagine 
how easy it would be for our economic agents to operate if the 
leu were convertible both in our country and abroad? You want to 
go to Kuwait for petroleum products, go and buy them. You want 
to go to China for food, go and buy it. You want to buy computer 
equipment in Japan, go and buy it. And everything for lei. We 
must remove the barriers which impede the economic initiative of 
the producer and the entrepreneur. Do you want me to cite one 
case, which although it seems to be from a different area 
touches on the essence of the question? 
  [Skvirenko] Absolutely! 
  [Bivol] Well, in the village of Kostesht in Yalovenskiy 
Rayon 
where I was born, land was distributed to the peasants by 
quotas. This was done in quite a primitive way, but... this 
year's extraordinary harvest was gathered in full and nothing 
was left in the fields or in the gardens. Another thing, the 
state lost a great deal here, since there was no record of the 
harvest and by no means were all taxes collected. But the 
harvest did not rot on the land and people did not become poor. 
Of course the state got its share too. That is to say, the very 
same mechanism which we are talking about. But a mechanism based 
on economic freedom rather than in spite of it. 
  [Skvirenko] It seems that the 2 years of intense work in the 
very epicenter of lively economic problems were not in vain for 
you. 
  [Bivol] Yes, our organization has grown stronger and defined 
itself. We have more than 100 operational employees and we are 
fairly well equipped; every territorial administration has a 
minimum of two official cars with radio communications, as is 
proper. We are trying to conduct our tests not simply 
efficiently but promptly, the moment the transaction occurs. We 
only have 24 hours, a day, to do all this. So we must work 
quickly. We come, we look at the documents, if there are any, 
and if there aren't, we hear the same thing--we have the 
documents but not here, wait till tomorrow, we'll get them. And 
so they do, since these days it is no problem to slap together 
some documents, just give them a few hours. But we do not allow 
it. We punish them. 
<H5>  Promptness, Risk, and Danger </H5>
  [Skvirenko] But just how do you achieve this very factor of 
promptness? Or is that a trade secret? 
  [Bivol] Of course I will not touch on all the nuances, but 
those who think that we have any secret agents, moles, or 
stooges are mistaken. 
  [Skvirenko] And I am ashamed to say that is exactly what I 
thought. 
  [Bivol] Essentially everything is much simpler and more 
reliable. When we check on any economic agent, we take into 
account all his ties, even if they have nothing to do with this 
particular transaction. That, strictly speaking, is the whole 
secret. And then there is the matter of equipment. In the 
evenings we usually get together, exchange information, compare 
what we already know, and draw conclusions. That is to say, we 
hand out assignments. And, you know, we rarely miss the mark. 
  [Skvirenko] Yes, it is simply that everything is brilliant. 
Then it must be that you already have some kind of data bank? 
  [Bivol] Of course. We have information about all economic 
agents and it is kept on computer. We naturally update, 
supplement, and correct this information all the time. 
  We are working on creating a data bank on all economic 
transactions. This job is more complicated than dynamic, but it 
can only be that way as a result of taking into account not only 
the "tip of the iceberg," but also getting an idea of the 
unrecorded capital, the "shadow capital." 
  We have the Jurist computer program and we use it to get 
answers to any questions regarding particular legislative or 
reference information in a matter of seconds. 
  [Skvirenko] Your associates must get a good wage, 
considering 
the nature of the work. 
  [Bivol] They get a fairly good wage, but that is not the 
point. We have working for us economists, accountants, and 
attorneys who could make a much larger salary in commercial 
structures. And the average age of our associates is just over 
40 years. 
  [Skvirenko] Just how do you attract them? 
  [Bivol] Work, complicated and gripping work. 
  [Skvirenko] But certainly dangerous too? 
  [Bivol] Maybe so. There have been cases of attacks on our 
associates; in fact I get telephone calls and have been 
threatened verbally and by letter. We have guns and we have 
other means of protection. We pay attention to special and 
physical training. We plan to open our own shooting range and 
martial arts school. But to be honest, it is something 
altogether different which really worries us. 
  [Skvirenko] What? 
  [Bivol] What we started the conversation with. Who are those 
monitoring organs? What are their rights and duties? What 
guarantees of their social protection are there? I will cite 
this example. We would like to hire graduates of our Economic 
Academy. But... what is to be done about their military duty? 
Their oath? How can weapons be entrusted to them? 
  And once again, what guarantees of protection do we, the 
employees of the financial guard, have? 
  [Skvirenko] Just what ones do you have? 
  [Bivol] None at all. Even in terms of a question like the 
right to use arms. God grant one of us will not have to use 
them. But does our country have a law on the use of weapons? 
There is no such law. So just how can the actions of our 
associate be evaluated in court? "On general principles"? 
  [Skvirenko] Yes, that is some puzzle. But to be honest, 
looking at you, one would never think that you have the burden 
of such serious problems. You look athletic, energetic, and 
smart. What is that, the result of special conditioning? 
  [Bivol] Most likely that is my nature. And the experience of 
work. After all, I have been working in the 
monitoring-inspection organs since 1970, and I came here right 
after graduating from the economics department of Kishinev 
Polytechnic Institute. 
  [Skvirenko] But even so, such specific work most likely 
demands some special self-control and restraint. How did you 
manage to be that way? Do you use special autogenic devices? 
  [Bivol] I try, when possible, to take advantage of the lunch 
break. But generally, the best relaxation for me is to be alone 
and retire into myself, even if it is not for long. 
  [Skvirenko] Where? In your office? In the car? At home? 
  [Bivol] Wherever, I am not fussy. 
  [Skvirenko] Do you experience a sense of fear? 
  [Bivol] Any answer to such a question would seem to be 
showing off. But the point is something altogether different. 
The point is the nature of the profession. People who are afraid 
of heights do not become steeplejacks. People who are afraid of 
enclosed places do not become miners. People who are afraid of 
wild animals do not become hunters. In fact there are a 
considerable number of professions which by their very essence 
are innately risky and dangerous. Take the work of a trolley 
driver; to me his responsibility and risk are absolutely 
comparable to the risk of a pilot or combat engineer. So against 
such a background our work does not seem so special at all. 
  [Skvirenko] How about your family? Do they treat your job so 
philosophically? 
  [Bivol] To be honest, my family, my wife and children, would 
like to see me in a different job. The fact that I carry a 
pistol and I am accompanied to the very doors of my home does 
not reassure my wife at all. 
  [Skvirenko] Accompanied by... a bodyguard? 
  [Bivol] Exactly, my driver. But at the same time those close 
to me know my nature. They know that if I have already chosen 
the work, I must do it conscientiously, without reservation, and 
without indulgences. 
  [Skvirenko] How should we conclude the interview? 
  [Bivol] I think with a wish for the new parliament which we 
will elect on 27 February. 
  Let us all finally turn to the economy. Let us consider and 
do everything we can to ensure that the economy provides all of 
us with what a person, society, and the state need for a proper 
life and successful development.

<F P=106> [Article by Mert Kubu: "Private Army in Estonia Causes </F>
Concern"] 
  [Text] "Halt! This is as far as you can go." With his 
combat-ready Kalashnikov, 21-year-old Joel Kitt stands in front 
of the gates to the former KGB wiretapping station in Pullapaa. 
He is one of the soldiers in the feared paramilitary company, a 
private army, a state within the Estonian state -- which no one 
seems to have the nerve to tackle. 
  The paramilitary force's camp is located at the far end of a 
promontory just a mile outside the Estonian town of Haapsalu. 
Inside the gates are 38 career soldiers, armed to the teeth. Two 
paramilitary men who are wanted by the police, suspected of 
complicity in a murder, are probably hidden there too. 
  However, their commander, "Lieutenant Colonel" Asso Kommer, 
has been detained by the police in Tallinn. He is suspected of 
having shot and wounded a police captain and his assistant. The 
two plainclothes policemen tried to stop Kommer on a street in 
downtown Tallinn. A firefight broke out. Rounds were fired from 
automatic weapons. Kommer fled, but was apprehended later. 
  Another of the company's officers has been detained and 
charged with hooliganism. 
<H5>  Fled to Sweden </H5>
  A third paramilitary leader, "Major" Jaak Mosin, fled to 
Sweden where he has applied for political asylum. Mosin is 
accused of attempting a "state coup." 
  Now the Estonian police want to interrogate the two private 
soldiers who are suspected of murder, but the company refuses to 
hand them over. 
  It is easy to understand why the criminal police are not 
eager to drive out to Pullapaa. The paramilitary camp looks like 
an army garrison. Behind the high fence they have set up 
machine-gun nests out of old tractor tires filled with sand. The 
young men have been trained by veterans of the war in 
Afghanistan. 
  Now both the police and the private soldiers are accusing 
each other of being in league with the mafia. Opinions differ on 
who fired the first shot on Parnuvagen. A government commission 
is looking into the matter. 
<H5>  Russian "Businessman" </H5>
  The police allege that "Lt. Col." Kommer was involved in the 
murder of a Russian "businessman." Kommer's defenders claim that 
the criminal police have mistreated him under interrogation and 
have also drugged the "lieutenant colonel." 
  One version of the rumors that are flying in Tallinn now 
maintains that the Russian "businessman" was really the key 
figure the police turned to in order to commission a 
professional killer from Russia for assignments in Estonia. 
According to this theory, the paramilitary force simply killed 
the Russian in order to get rid of him. 
  Whatever is true, the whole thing is an incredible story 
that 
could only happen in a country that has just won its freedom and 
is moving toward a fragile democracy. Those involved in the 
affair include cabinet ministers, many members of parliament, 
the defense staff, the Home Guard, and high-ranking police 
officers -- and it is very likely that the frequently mentioned 
mafia is peripherally involved as well. 
  The paramilitary soldiers themselves? Most are young men in 
their twenties, their leaders are somewhat older. For a large 
part of the Estonian nation they are heroes who have struck 
terror into the hearts of the mafia, of organized criminals. 
Others call them bandits, murderers, extortionists. 
  The paramilitary company was born during the "singing 
revolution." The company was organized from the newly formed 
Estonian Home Guard (Kaitseliit). The officers were appointed by 
the Estonian Government in exile. This exile government had been 
in existence in Sweden, Norway and the United States during all 
the years of the occupation. It quickly appointed some 80 
reliable "officers" in Estonia. 
<H5>  Long Popular </H5>
  The paramilitary soldiers in Pullapaa were very popular for 
a 
long time. When the police were powerless against the extortion 
rings, people called on the paramilitary force. They are famous 
for the time they cleaned up the Kibuvitsa (Wild Rose) Bar. They 
lay in ambush, seized eight Russian extortionists, shot them in 
the legs, pulled sacks over their heads, and delivered the 
bloody group to the local sheriff. That is how things used to be 
done in the wild West, but hardly in a nation governed by law. 
The Estonian Government appointed a commission. But nothing 
happened. 
  Last summer, then Defense Minister Hain Rebas, a 
Swedish-Estonian history professor and reserve captain in the 
Swedish Armed Forces, tried to straighten things out. The 
paramilitary company was to be disbanded. The soldiers refused 
to surrender their weapons. Members of the Home Guard from all 
over the country came to the aid of the paramilitary force. A 
regular military unit, the Kalev battalion, was order to move 
toward Pullapaa. 
  Fortunately they desisted from attacking at the last minute. 
For three critical days Estonia was very close to a small civil 
war. 
  Defense Minister Rebas resigned in protest against the 
passivity of the other members of the government. 
  And today? The 38 paramilitary men work in shifts. 
  "We go to Tallinn and guard a metal warehouse and a casino, 
among other things. The food is good here. There will be more of 
us in the spring," said the young guard, Joel, before the guard 
commander, Eero, came out with his pistol dangling in the 
holster under his arm and shouted at Joel. 
  They are not allowed to get too friendly with strangers 
here. 
<H5>  A Leader Who Shuns the Light </H5>
  Behind the Estonian paramilitary force stands "Colonel" 
Kalle 
Eller, a short man in his fifties. He is a former language 
teacher. 
  We met at dusk in a house in central Tallinn. Eller prefers 
to move around when it is dark outside. 
  "I have been forced to go underground. The criminal police 
have conducted three raids in an effort to catch me," Eller said. 
  Eller assured us that he has no quarrel with the Estonian 
Government. Until quite recently he was a public adviser to the 
parliamentary Defense Committee. Eller was also a frequent 
visitor to Justice Minister Kaido Kama's office. He is a private 
adviser to Kama. Both are supernationalists. 
  "We simply do not trust the red `polkovniks', the colonels 
from the former Red Army who are still found in the leadership 
of the Estonian Armed Forces," Eller said. 
  Isn't it enough that Estonia's commander in chief is a 
former 
high-ranking NATO officer who worked in the Pentagon for a long 
time? 
  No, Eller did not think so. The commander is surrounded by 
far too many former "reds." Nor does Eller believe in the police 
charges against Kommer, while the accusations against "Major" 
Mosin, who is in exile in Sweden, are absurd fabrications, in 
his opinion. 
  Who pays the paramilitary force in Pullapaa? 
  "Sponsors. The men are paid 1,000 kronor a month, the 
officers and the female company doctor gets 1,500. The money 
comes from private security jobs in Tallinn, among other things." 
  And Eller turned up his collar and disappeared into the dark 
city.

<F P=106> [Article by Juhan Kivirahk: "All Institutions of Power </F>
Improved Their Standing 
<H6>  Public Opinion in January </H6>
  The internal political tensions of January, stemming 
from the change of ministers, opened the door for changes in 
approval ratings given the government and the president. 
However, as one can see from the results of a survey published 
in yesterday's paper, the performances of the political theater 
no longer have the impact they used to have--public opinion 
remained indifferent to what was happening. This is why there 
were no major changes in the ratings for major institutions of 
power. Instead, there was a slight gain in the ratings for all 
of them--the government, the parliament, the president, and even 
the opposition. 
  Those who are used to viewing Estonia's political landscape 
as a battlefield, where positions are firmly drawn and where one 
forward step by one side inevitably means a step back for the 
opposition, will find it difficult to understand these results. 
Indeed, a battle (of words) was being waged for all the people 
to see. First, an attack was made by the president, who gave a 
devastating assessment of the government's leader. Then, 
virtually the entire political establishment, along with most of 
the media, came down on the president himself. The board of 
Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament] even received a legislative 
bill to protect the president, the government, the parliament 
and the people...from the president. 
  People do not seem to sense any particular danger from the 
president as they give, month after month, progressively better 
ratings to the institution of president. The president's 
activity is considered to be fully or basically in line with the 
interests of the people by 54 percent of those queried (57 
percent among Estonians, and 49 percent among non-Estonians). A 
month ago, the president had a 50 percent positive approval 
rating. 
  Quite remarkable is the sudden drop in `cannot tell' 
responses for the presidential ratings by non-Estonians--in 
December they amounted to 28 percent, now only 15 percent. This 
also accounted for an 8 percent increase in positive, and a 5 
percent increase in negative ratings. 
  However, the president was not the only one to improve his 
ratings. January's survey ratings also went up for the 
parliament and for the government. Those gains, however, were 
not sufficient to offset the predominance of negative ratings. 
Riigikogu's performance was rated to correspond to the interests 
of the people by 40 percent of the respondents (36 percent in 
December), and not corresponding by 48 percent (December 51 
percent) of the respondents. For the government, the ratio of 
positive to negative ratings was 35 and 53 percent respectively 
(33 and 56 percent for December). 
  The confusion around the so-called overhaul of the 
government 
certainly came in handy for the opposition, whose ratings also 
went up somewhat. Supporters of the opposition currently number 
about the same as those of the government (32 percent, compared 
to 29 percent in December), opponents are fewer (37 percent, 
same in December), with the number of respondents in the 'cannot 
tell' category up considerably. 
  Public opinion does not follow any black-or-white rules of 
logic. Here are some examples taken out of today's range of 
problems. 
  In the course of changing ministers, there was a definite 
clash between the attitudes of the president and the government, 
and between the president and the Isamaa [Fatherland] faction. 
If we look at how the performane of the president and the 
government is being rated by those observers who support the 
Isamaa faction, we get above average ratings for Riigikogu (69 
percent of the responses are on the positive side), the 
government (64 percent), and also (and especially!) the 
president (80 percent!).

  Even out of the supporters of the Entrepreneurs' Party 
which, 
through its only member in the parliament is more often than not 
opposed to the government, 65 percent approve the performance of 
both the government and the president. For supporters of the 
central and coalition factions the 'polarity' is in place, of 
course, with 75 and 63 percent respectively not satisfied with 
the government's performance. 
  The clearest positions on powers-that-be are taken by those 
respondents who support the Democratic Labor Party and the 
League of Pensioners--62 percent of the first, and 53 percent of 
the second support neither the government nor the president (all 
these examples are based on opinions held by Estonian citizens). 
  As usual, we also asked a separate question to establish the 
most trusted institution of power. "Please compare the 
performance of the parliament, with that of the president and 
the opposition, and say whose performance you trust most?" 
was the question. Responses to this question also show the 
president taking the lead. 
  Responses broke down as follows:

<F P=106> [BNS release: "Zhirinovskiy's Representative in Estonia </F>
Recommends That Retired Russian Military Personnel Form Defense 
Units"] 
  [Text] 
  TALLINN (BNS). Russia's retired and reserve military 
personnel living in Estonia should organize into units to defend 
their honor and dignity, thinks Pyotr Rozhok, representative of 
Russia's Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia. 
  "If some Estonian official should try to send out a Russian 
officer, he better look out for himself. Should there be a 
police check or some other inspection by some kind of officials, 
they should just be removed by force, and that's that," said 
Pyotr Rozhok, in his interview with SILLAMYAESKI VESTNIK 
[Russian language local newspaper in Estonia]. 
  Rozhok thinks that Estonia is `an ancient Russian region'. 
  "Nobody has nullified the Nystad peace treaty or the 1975 
Helsinki accord. This is why retired and reserve members of the 
Russian military living here should know that they live in 
ancient Russian territory," asserts Zhirinovskiy's 
representative in Estonia. 
  Rozhok also thinks that all Russians living in Estonia 
should 
take out Russian citizenship `so as to benefit from the 
protection and support of great Russia'. 
  Rozhok says that he convinced Zhirinovski not to toss around 
such expressions as `let's bring in the tanks', but to threaten 
Estonia only with economic sanctions. 
  Commenting on the statement that, should economic sanctions 
be applied, the first to be hit would be the Russian industrial 
workers, Rozhok replied: "Russians have nothing left to lose, 
anyhow." 
  Referring to organizations for Estonia's Russian-speaking 
population, Rozhok spoke highly of the activities of Yuri 
Mishin, leader of the Narva Russian Citizens' League. The 
Representative Assembly, however, was termed by him as the 
'academy for dismantling all Russian movements, parties and 
organizations, under the baton of Estonia's government.'

<F P=106> [Article by Agnes Jurgens: "Land Reform Not Moving </F>
Ahead, Because People Do Not Want the Land Back"] 
  [Text] 
  Yesterday, the government's land reform commission held 
its ninth session. As is known, the work of this commission is 
headed by reform minister Liia Hanni, others attending 
were 
ministers Jaan Leetsaar, Kaido Kama and Andres Tarand. 
  Those gathered listened to information about how land reform 
and ownership reform are coming along in the Vorumaa 
district. An overview was given by Tiit Soosaar, the new 
district elder of Vorumaa and Tiiu Joe, head of the 
Vorumaa Land Office. There are more than 200 registered 
pieces of real estate in the Vorumaa district, making it 
one 
of the three leading districts in the republic. One could say 
that property returns in Vrumaa have been carried out 
successfully even though, by now, progress is coming to a halt, 
as it has everywhere else. People are no longer in a hurry to 
become landowners, because there is no profit in cultivating 
land, they are interested more in getting the land back or 
getting compensated for it. Not having a land assessment law, 
however, has brought all of this to a standstill. 
  Jaan Leetsaar, minister of agriculture, told this reporter 
later, by way of a comment, that he is very much concerned about 
the situation faced at the time of spring plowing. There is no 
sense of security neither for those owning the land, nor for 
those currently using it. The minister thought that it was high 
time for the parish governments to assemble legally entitled 
owners and current users of land around a negotiating table and 
reach a peaceful agreement about land management. 
  The bill of the cadastral law was also discussed by the 
commission. A review of it was presented by Valter Aasmae, 
one of the principal authors of the bill. Next week, all members 
of the government commission will give their opinions on the 
bill, whereupon it will be introduced to the ministries. Land 
Office advisor Toomas Kutti thought that the cadastral law could 
be passed by Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament] in a 
month-and-a-half, at the earliest. 
  The commission also talked about the bill for land 
assessment 
law, now in its second reading in Riigikogu. No changes were 
deemed necessary in that bill. 
  At virtually all of the sessions of the government's land 
reform commission, there has been talk about people who are to 
carry out land and ownership reform--pointing out that there are 
not enough of them and those who are available do not have the 
necessary training. The agricultural school at Kehtna has been 
preparing people for this job and it also has a special 
curriculum for it. However, it is high time that both the 
agricultural and technical universities start training a new 
crop of reformers. 
  The commission was also seeking ways to simplify the 
procedures for turning land and structures over to municipal 
ownership.

<F P=106> [Report from Business Desk: "Cost of Living Up 5.5 Percent </F>
in January"] 
  [Text] 
  The increase in the consumer price index was bigger in 
January of this year than it has been for any previous month 
since January of 1993. Last month, the cost of living went up 
5.5 percent, compared to December. 
  According to the Bureau of Statistics, food prices for 
January went up 4.7 percent, compared to December. Increases in 
the price of manufactured goods amounted to 3.1 percent, while 
prices for services went up 8.2 percent. By categories of goods, 
the biggest price increase was noted for eggs (18.4 percent), 
fish products (10.9 percent), and transport and communications 
services (10.8 percent).

  The Bureau of Statistics has also compared this year's 
consumer price index with that of January of 1993. It shows 
that, over a year's time, a price increase averaging 38.4 
percent has taken place across all the categories of goods used 
to compute the index. The biggest increase was noted for eggs 
(96.7 percent), followed by housing (65.8 percent), soft drinks 
(59.9 percent), meat products (58.9 percent), fish and related 
products (52.5), and clothing and footwear (44.5 percent). 
  As of January of this year, changes are also noted in the 
composition of the market basket. Buying patterns show a drop in 
spending for food, alcohol and tobacco, clothing and footwear, 
housekeeping and leisure time activities; while increased 
spending is noted for housing, health care, transportation and 
communications, and for other goods and services. 
  The last mentioned grouping includes spending for vital 
services, personal hygiene products, eating out, sundry utility 
items, and services not included under other categories. The 
`leisure time' category of goods combines radio sets and related 
items, sports and photographic equipment, flowers, printed 
materials, cultural or sporting events, self improvement and 
nursery schools. Housekeeping related spending goes for the 
acquisition of furniture, home appliances, dishes, etc. 
  The new weighing system is based on Emor's study of family 
budgets that reflects the spending patterns for an average 
family in 1993. From now on, for greater reliability, 
calculations for the index are based on price changes for 410 
representative items (their previous number was 272). Base 
values are derived from average prices for 1993.

<F P=106> [Article by Tiit Tambi: "Problems of Nuclear Waste Removal </F>
About To Be Solved"] 
  [Text] 
  A conference of the working group on nuclear and 
radiation safety in the Baltic Seaboard countries ended in 
Tallinn yesterday. 
  At a meeting with journalists following the conference, 
Antii 
Vuorinen from Finland said that the radiation danger still 
plagues the Baltic Sea region. To reduce that danger, it is 
necessary that the newly freed Baltic states join with 
agreements that have previously been concluded with the Soviet 
Union. These would include agreements on curbing the 
proliferation of nuclear substances and, in case of danger, 
making information available promptly. Vuorinen was pleased that 
the problem of removing nuclear waste from Paldiski is close to 
being solved. 
  Foreign ministry advisor Mark Sinisoo elaborated on his 
remark. Namely, the working group had received new data on 
several of the problems recently. To remove nuclear waste from 
Paldiski, Russia wants to use a brand new TK-18 type of 
container that has never been used for that purpose before. This 
is why they have to be tested, which is to be done in March. 
What if Russia's nuclear monitoring agency should declare them 
unfit? 
  Russia, at this time, does also not have a policy for 
storing 
nuclear waste, and this needs to be coordinated with the 
government. Besides, this policy supposedly also depends on the 
availability of money and on Russia's so-called `global nuclear 
problems.' By way of consolation: The Paldiski issue will not be 
coming to a standstill because of these snags. 
  The working group also discussed Sillamae and matters 
related to radioactive beacons. Other news pertaining to the 
not-so-secret Salaspilsis reactor in Latvia (a science-oriented 
facility) revealed that it uses 90-percent enriched uranium. The 
latter presents quite a hazard.

<F P=106> [Article by Lise Tajik: "Cement Plant in Estonia Gets Big </F>
Environment Loan"] 
  [Text] The World Bank through its subsidiary, the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC), has granted over 200 
million [Danish] kroner for modernizing and improving the 
environmental impact of a large cement plant in Estonia, AS 
Kunda Nordic Cement. The agreement is IFC's largest investment 
project in the former Soviet Union. 
  According to a preliminary agreement, around 56 million 
kroner of this amount will be used for expanding the harbor 
facilities in Kunda, while 50 million are earmarked for 
environmental improvements, including stronger filters. 
  The cement plant, which was built in the 1960's based on 
East 
German brown- coal technology, has for years been the area's 
greatest environmental threat, because the plant each hour 
unhindered has been spewing out 15 tons of cement dust up 
through its smokestacks -- corresponding to 10-15 percent of 
production. Converting this, it means that in 10 years enough 
cement to build two Great Belt bridges has fallen on the head of 
inhabitants of Kunda. 
  The Kunda plant currently is responsible for a third of 
Estonia's total air pollution, but after modernization is 
completed, it is expected that this level will drop to 1 or 2 
percent. At the same time, production is expected to double to 
900,000 tons annually. 
  The greatest part of production is expected to be earmarked 
for Western markets.

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Juknevicius: "The Project for the </F>
Reorganization of the National Defense Ministry Provides for 
Wide Epaulets for Almost Every Official"] 
  [Text] Following the reorganization of the National Defense 
Ministry, 123 people should be employed in it: 27 individuals in 
the Personnel and Social Welfare Department, 22 in Economics and 
Finance, 23 in International Communications. In the economic 
section, eight officers will be in charge of nine temporaries, 
electricians and chairwomen. It is planned to have a major serve 
as the minister's aide; his deputy, a state secretary, will be a 
general; and colonels will serve as department directors. The 
Ministry of National Defense between the wars had a total of 42 
officials. 
  In the opinion of K. Gaska, member of the parliamentary 
committee on national defense, this reorganization is just a 
"soap bubble," a waste of funds, and a militarization of the 
ministry, because most of the ministry personnel will be given 
official military ranks. 
  "I would understand it if the 27 people doing personnel and 
social welfare work would be taking care of the Lithuanian army 
structures, but this institution will have a department charged 
with the same functions," K. Gaska said. K. Gaska cannot 
understand why the project provides for a military "ministry of 
foreign affairs" -- that is how large the International 
Communications Department is. 
  Chief of general staff, Colonel S. Knezys, confirmed that, 
as 
a preliminary measure, personnel and social questions in the 
Lithuanian military command apparatus will be handled by five, 
economics and finance by nine, and military communications with 
abroad by six officials (including the three interpreters). 
  S. Knezys said that the separation of the functions of the 
army leadership from the National Defense Ministry was a 
complicated step, because a similar experience did not exist. On 
the other hand not only the army's institutions but also those 
of the state border control and civil defense are subordinate to 
the ministry. It is not yet known who will perform what 
functions. 
  "Each department could buy its own furniture, but the 
ministry would probably be able to buy the canisters for 
everybody at the cheapest price," S. Knezys said. According to 
him, the processes of the creation of the army apparatus and of 
the reorganization of the ministry are being coordinated; the 
number of people in each ministry department might change after 
two or three months. 
  The press representative of the National Defense Ministry, 
L. 
Zegeriene, said that his process of the reorganization of the 
ministry was not a final one. The reorganization may still take 
several months longer. The analogous experience of the West 
European states will be studied. L. Zegeriene thinks that the 
future ministry may not require a large department of protocol. 
The international relations department could also be smaller.

<F P=106> [Article by Daiva Rinkeviciute: "The Independent Radio and </F>
TV Stations Against National Monopoly of the Ether"] 
  [Text] Instead of their accustomed programs or music, the 
listeners of the radio stations M1, RADIOCENTRAS (Radio Center), 
VILNIAUS VARPAS (The Bell of Vilnius), ZNAD WILII, and the 
viewers of TELE-3 and BALTIJOS TELEVIZIJA (Baltic Television) 
heard the following text yesterday at 8 pm: "During this hour 
we, the independent radio and television stations, are not 
broadcasting our customary programs, because we want to warn 
you, listeners and viewers, about the tragic consequences of the 
monopoly and totalitarian control of Lithuania's ether for the 
constitutional rights and freedoms of all the inhabitants of 
Lithuania." 
  The text, which was interrupted by the main announcements of 
those stations, was read for five minutes. Starting today, the 
above-mentioned radio stations will be broadcasting 
announcements five times a day, urging the people to clip and to 
mail in questionnaires, published in the press, investigating 
listeners' and viewers' opinions about the independent 
television and radio stations. 
  Journalists were informed about this action, its causes and 
purposes yesterday, at the Lithuanian Journalists Union. 
Chairman of the governmental commission on the development of 
radio and television, R. Jasinavicius, and the chairmen and 
representatives of television channel TALE-3, television studio 
BALTIJOS TELEVIZIJA, radio stations M1, RADIOCENTRAS, ZNAD 
WILII, TITANIKA, as well as the leaders and representatives of 
the radio station VILNIAUS VARPAS took part at the press 
conference. They acquainted the journalists not only with their 
action, but also with the statement which they had addressed to 
the President of the Lithuanian Republic, the chairman of the 
Parliament, and the Prime Minister. It states that in the area 
of mass information media the government is not only 
maintaining, but is also strengthening the monopoly, giving 
priority to Lithuania's radio and television and monopolizing 
the communications media. 
  According to the authors of the statement, an 
anticonstitutional situation from the legal point of view has 
been created in this area. The situation must be changed if the 
freedom of expression is to be nurtured in Lithuania. The 
authors demand that the planned raises for the rental of the 
state radio and television means of communication be revoked and 
that the Lithuanian Republic TV be decommercialized. Otherwise, 
the independent television and radio stations will be destroyed 
economically. They survive only from advertising, while the 
state radio and television draws its income both from the 
taxpayers pockets and from advertising. 
  The main purpose of the action is making equal the 
conditions 
under which both the state and the independent structures exist. 
  At the press conference it was mentioned that the 
representatives of the independent radio and television stations 
are not calling for a strike or some big action that would harm 
the people of Lithuania and the organizers of such actions. They 
will seek a convocation of an expanded Government session, with 
the participation of the representatives of the mass information 
media and of the interested departments, for the solution of the 
strategic problems of Lithuania's electronic mass information 
media.

<F P=106> [Speech by Algirdas Brazauskas, president of the Republic of </F>
Lithuania, to the North Atlantic Council: "Cooperation For 
Peace, Not War] 
  [Text] Mr. General Secretary of NATO! 
  Your excellencies! 
  Ladies and gentlemen! 
  Only upon having restored its national independence on March 
11 of 1990, after a hiatus of fifty years, and upon having 
consistently carried out political and free market economic 
reforms, is Lithuania beginning to participate in the 
implementation of the new security strategy of the North 
Atlantic states. This strategy is oriented toward the 
establishment of the fundamental values of democracy, law, 
peace, and human dignity. 
  The security and stability of a country are essential 
preconditions for the functioning of democracy and of the free 
market. We are convinced that the assurance of Lithuanian 
national security is an integral and inseparable part of the 
security of Europe as a whole. Lithuania alone cannot ensure its 
own security. We think that European--and Lithuanian--security 
must be guaranteed by the political, economic, and military 
integration of the countries concerned, the most important 
institutional manifestations of which are the European Union and 
NATO. 
  Lithuania seeks to participate in the strengthening of the 
security of the North Atlantic region by becoming a member of 
NATO and of the European Union, as well as of the Western 
European Union. Lithuania sees its integration into the economic 
and political structures of the European Union and its 
integration into the political and defensive structures of NATO 
and the Western European Union as mutually interrelated 
processes. 
  Lithuania welcomes the NATO initiative "Partnership for 
Peace" as a means of improving the security and stability of the 
whole region from Vancouver to Vladivostok. I would imagine that 
this initiative does not fully satisfy all of those countries 
that seek to draw closer to NATO or to join the Union. It is a 
compromise plan, oriented toward the future, not the past, 
toward a Europe not riven by suspicion, hate, opposing 
ideologies, or widely divergent standards of living. 
  I would especially like to emphasize that by entering into 
the "Partnership for Peace" program, Lithuania has as its 
clear-cut goal full-fledged membership in NATO, a goal that I 
have also emphasized in my letter to the General Secretary of 
NATO. 
  More and more people in Lithuania are beginning to realize 
that the mere desire to become a member of NATO and to receive 
guarantees of security is not enough. We ourselves must create 
in our own country not only the military, but also the 
political, economic, and psychological foundation for 
integration corresponding to those of the NATO countries. 
  Upon signing the major document inviting "Partnership for 
Peace," Lithuania is prepared to begin the work of implementing 
the democratic control of defense structures, opening up the 
defense budget process, and common planning, training, and 
exercises. We will try to create opportunities for cooperation 
with NATO forces in areas such as peacekeeping, search and 
rescue operations, humanitarian aid, etc. Lithuania recognizes 
that integration into NATO is a complex evolutionary process 
that requires great intellectual and material resources. 
  We should ask other interested countries to join in the work 
of "Partnership for Peace." 
  I would also like to make note of the organizational 
significance of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. 
Lithuania views with favor the role of the Council's political 
consultations in the successful withdrawal of the Russian army 
from Lithuania. We intend to apply the recommendations of the 
"North Atlantic Cooperation Council Group on Cooperation for the 
Maintenance of Peace" in developing the idea of a joint 
Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian peacekeeping unit. Lithuania 
welcomes the opportunities set forth in the proposal for the 
preparation of joint military training and exercizes, and is 
preparing to fully participate in them. We were pleased to hear 
the news that the foreign ministers on the Council had accepted 
the suggestion that the meeting of the Atlantic political 
advisory group with the "Cooperation" partners scheduled for the 
spring of 1994 be held in Vilnius. 
  I would like to draw attention to the fact that the 
Lithuanian position on membership in NATO is not directed 
against any neighboring or other European country. 
  Lithuania is a supporter of a unified move of the Baltic 
states into Europe. Lithuania's request of January 4, 1994, for 
membership in NATO is an integral part of the cooperation of the 
Baltic states amongst themselves and with NATO. The military 
cooperation of the Baltic states is not and must not be 
construed as the creation of a threat to Russia. Lithuania has 
no territorial claims whatsoever against its neighbors. 
  Russian pronouncements to the effect that Russia has special 
interests and rights to maintain peace in the so-called "near 
abroad", or the ex-territory of the USSR, do not quite accord 
with the spirit of either international law or of the 
"Partnership for Peace." Especially difficult to understand are 
Russian claims of special interests in the Baltic states, if 
only because Lithuania and the other Baltic states were never 
legally parts of the USSR. 
  Lithuania is in favor of the implementation of international 
norms and agreements, and emphasizes the importance of the 
rapid, orderly, and unconditional withdrawal of the Russian army 
from Latvia and Estonia, which will increase the security and 
stability of the Baltic sea region. The peaceful withdrawal of 
the Russian army from Lithuania serves as an example of the 
fundamentally new possibilities for coexistence in this region 
of Europe. 
  The acceptance of the Baltic states as well as of the 
Visegrad and other Central European countries into the European 
Union, NATO, and the Western European Union would strongly and 
effectively stimulate economic and political reforms in those 
countries. We are convinced that it would provide significant 
support for the strengthening and continuity of the democratic 
processes in Russia. We are among those who are convinced that 
Russia can have a democratic future. That is why the leadership 
of the Republic of Lithuania supports the efforts of Western 
countries to help Russia carry out its political and economic 
reforms, to create a democratic Russia. 
  I believe that after the passage of some period of time, in 
a 
similar auditorium, a president of Lithuania will place his 
signature on a document that will ratify full integration of the 
Republic of Lithuania into a structure that recognizes common 
values and guarantees security and stability--the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization.

<F P=106> [Article by Ana Trescina: "Trauma and Economic Loss: The </F>
Medical Profession is Again Sounding the Alarm, this time over 
Needless Deaths"] 
  [Text] Many inhabitants of Lithuania die from accidents, 
poisoning, and trauma. The first and second places in these sad 
statistics are held by diseases of the circulatory system and 
cancer, respectively. Doctors are also concerned by the fact 
that there are many more suicides than homicides. Very many 
children and teenagers die needlessly (in this age group, 
accidents are the most common cause of death), as do men (three 
times more than women), and rural dwellers (1.85 times more than 
urban dwellers). 
  Medical statistics prove that deaths caused by trauma are 
increasing every year: In 1988, there were 2665, while in 1992, 
there were 3344. Medical professionals think that the number of 
needless deaths is increasing due to the free trade in alcohol, 
which is often of inferior quality. This assertion is supported 
by statistical data: The number of accidents and suicides began 
to increase in 1988. Yesterday members of the medical community, 
having called a press conference, announced to reporters that 
they plan to deal with the problems of the prevention of trauma 
and suicide at the governmental level by creating an interagency 
trauma control council. It would consist of representatives of 
the ministries of Health, Social Security, Interior, 
Transportation, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, and 
Construction and Urban Planning. Also planned is a program of 
public education and training, the reorganization of the 
delivery of medical services and the work of the 
traumatology-orthopaedics departments, equipping them with 
diagnostic and treatment tools, the creation of an effective 
system for the medical and social rehabilitation of trauma 
victims as well as a system of suicide prevention. Without a 
doubt, the new council will come out in favor of a state 
monopoly on alcohol. 
  We can be sure that the government will take an interest in 
the creation of the council, for trauma in the workplace causes 
an annual loss of 250 million litas.

  [Text] The Iceland-Lithuania Friendship Society has set up 
a new communications center in Vilnius in the hope of spurring 
commercial activity between Iceland and the Baltic nation. 
  "We have a wealth of opportunity in Lithuania if we go after 
it. But the opportunity is opening up right now and it will be 
much more difficult to enter the market at a later point in 
time," [Reykjavik] MORGUNBLADID quoted the center's founders as 
commenting. 
  Icelanders have been fairly diligent at developing the 
promising Baltic market since they became the first nation to 
recognize Lithuania's independence in 1991. 
  Health firm Islenska Heilsufelagid is on the cusp of 
starting 
up production of pharmaceutical drugs in cooperation with the 
University of Vilnius, while film studio Mydaver Saga is 
producing animated films. 
  In addition, Icelanders and Lithuanians have teamed up in a 
project to breed the Icelandic Horse.

"About the Present and Future of the CIS; Notes on the 
National-State Structure of the Former USSR"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Opinion </H5>
  Attempts to find a new, effective form of national-state 
structure of the former USSR have not yet been crowned with 
success. The reason for this is mainly the complexity and 
arduousness of this matter and, in addition, the errors of 
politicians, both former and current. The most significant error 
on this path, in my opinion, was the signing of the Belovezha 
agreement by the leaders of three republics on 8 December 1991 
without the concurrence and even against the will of the people 
who in March of that same year had expressed themselves for the 
preservation of the USSR. 
  The Belovezha act was an error, because it disrupted the 
process of the reformation of the USSR and its transformation 
from a unitary state, if not into a genuinely federative one, 
then at least into a confederative state. As a result, instead 
of a directed, objectively necessary, and extremely important 
process of reformation, we got an unmanageable, chaotic process 
of a hasty, in many ways senseless, "parade of sovereignties" 
and the collapse of both the former USSR and also of its 
component parts. This could not help but have a negative effect 
on all aspects of life of the former Union: on the economy, 
politics, culture, humanitarian relations, etc. 
  The politicians who signed the agreement on the creation of 
the CIS justified their decision by the fact that attempts to 
reform the Union failed one after the other, that it would not 
have been possible to preserve it under any circumstances, and 
that, therefore, nothing remained except to agree to a new form 
of mutual relations--the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  Explanations such as this (or, more accurately, 
justifications) seem to me, to put it mildly, incorrect. Mainly 
because the process of reformation, albeit with great 
difficulty, was moving forward, and I am confident: It would 
have been crowned with success sooner or later. 
  In justifying the signing of the Belovezha agreement, 
reference is also made to the categorical nonconcurrence and 
lack of desire of Ukraine to enter into any kind of new union, 
which without it allegedly would be inconceivable. From my 
standpoint, this is also an incorrect position. I think that 
even if Ukraine did not agree to join the new union, it would 
have to be created without it. The situation sooner or later 
would have forced the most zealous Ukrainian separatists and 
nationalists to join the new union. Especially because in its 
essence it really would be new. What is happening now confirms 
such a conclusion. Getting to the point, present-day Ukraine 
already agrees to join an economic union, and it is hardly worth 
doubting that with time it will also agree to join other unions 
within the scope of the CIS. The realization is sinking deeper 
and deeper into the consciousness of the masses, and into the 
consciousness of the politicians, that abstract freedom, or 
freedom in itself, is not worth a lot if it does not have an 
appropriate material or other base, if it cannot be used for the 
welfare of a majority of the population, and if it only brings 
grief and difficulties for millions of ordinary people. 
  After three years, bitter experience has now proved that 
which in March 1991 in the all-Union referendum prompted common 
sense and a healthy instinct. It was the rapid and reckless 
collapse that was the main source of a majority of today's 
troubles of the inhabitants of the CIS, and especially of their 
economic difficulties. It follows from this that in order to 
correct the situation, it is necessary for the post-Soviet 
state, without putting it off, to join in union relationships. 
But at the same time, it must be clearly understood that there 
can be no question of the former Union relationships. Only a new 
type of union can be at issue. 
  In creating it, in my opinion, it is necessary to take into 
account several fundamental facts. And the following most of all. 
  1. A majority of the former Soviet republics, and most of 
all 
those that were not federations, judging by everything, will 
become federations. For example, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, 
and Ukraine, however absurd and undesirable it would seem now to 
some politicians. The development of events could lead to this 
even in some post-Soviet Asiatic countries in which the national 
liberation struggle of small nations is already flaring up. 
  2. The Soviet Union cannot objectively be restored to its 
own 
previous form. But in the course of centuries (and especially 
during the decades of the Soviet period), the component parts of 
the former USSR, their economies and other spheres of social 
life became so knitted and intertwined, that as a matter of fact 
a single organism was formed which, of course, cannot and will 
not function normally in a torn-apart condition no matter how 
much this would be forced. But this organism was developed 
inharmoniously and disproportionately. We already knew very 
well, for example, that the VPK [military-industrial complex] 
and certain other spheres enjoyed excessive privileges and 
resources. It follows from this that in creating a new union it 
was necessary to get rid of these defects, first and foremost 
owing to the structural restructuring of the economy. 
  3. The unequal and nonequivalent relations among the 
republics that manifested themselves, on the one hand, in the 
fact that the center (Kremlin) dictated and, on the other hand, 
in the fact that by order of this same center, Russia gave the 
outskirts much of what it vitally needed itself, must remain in 
the past forever, no matter how much someone from Moscow or on 
the periphery would like the reverse. 
  It follows from all of this that the problem of changing the 
essence of the relations among the former parts of the USSR is 
very complicated, but it became even more complicated when in 
December 1991 the process of the reformation of the Union was 
disrupted and the broken-up parts started to get farther and 
farther away from each other, each creating its special 
socioeconomic system. Today, it is already more difficult than a 
year or two years ago to unite these parts, although centripetal 
forces are also building up. Of course, the question can also be 
put in a different way: Why is it absolutely necessary to unite? 
Perhaps to create a genuine commonwealth of independent states? 
In my opinion, in the case of the former republics of the USSR, 
such a form as a commonwealth is obviously inadequate (in 
contrast, for example, to that commonwealth of nations that 
Great Britain created in its time). Not so much because it does 
not allow the reformation of the former Union as fast as 
possible and more effectively, and (which is most important of 
all) with the least costs for everyone, especially for the 
population of the CIS, but because the process of reformation 
could be disrupted completely. In failing to bear the burdens of 
reorganization of the totalitarian system, the people of the 
former Union republics can express themselves simply for a 
return to the old and bring forces to power that will come out 
in support of this. This will mean that the historical mission 
that was entrusted to all former Soviet republics and that 
consists of imperative changes in the socioeconomic system will 
not be fulfilled. But this chance, which history gave us, will 
be missed once again. 
  Another variant of the negative development of events--the 
construction of wild capitalism (it is this variant that is 
being conducted now before our eyes)--also will not bring us 
closer to the desired objective--a civilized, modern society. 
  4. Rather intensive processes are developing not only in the 
republics of the near abroad, but also in Russia itself, that 
are leading to its reorganization into either a genuine 
federation or into a federation with elements of a 
confederation. The recent example of the signing of the treaty 
between Russia and Tatarstan is a graphic illustration of this. 
If we do not forget that other autonomous republics, krays, and 
oblasts are also not only dreaming of something like this, but 
are persistently pressing for their own, then it can be asserted 
with confidence that "the process has started." (What is more, I 
think that in signing the treaty with Tatarstan, Russia set a 
good example for other countries of the CIS, in particular the 
states of the Transcaucasus.) And this is not a process of 
dissolution, as many claim, but a process of reformation. It 
should not be feared, nor should attempts be made to turn it 
backwards. Not so much because such efforts will be fruitless, 
but because they obviously will lead to opposite results. 
  Therefore, as it seems to me, it is necessary to meet this 
process halfway deliberately, directing it and not allowing it 
to turn into one that is rapid and out of control, and with all 
our strength to prevent a repetition of the errors of the 
collapse of the Union in 1991. If this is not done, then an 
enormous tragedy, which will be the consequence of the breakup 
of Russia, cannot be avoided. The dissolution of Russia is 
possible now only by reforming the mutual relations between the 
subjects of the Federation in Russia itself, and by reducing the 
role of the center and increasing the independence of the 
regions. In other words, under current conditions, the power of 
Russia should begin not in the center, but in the regions that 
comprise it. The center should behave like a wise and capable 
regulator of the basic social processes in the country, and not 
like a monster that is feared by everyone and that everyone is 
striving to get rid of. 
  What is the general conclusion? 
  The present CIS is an ineffective formation, and it is 
generally not very viable. It is necessary to acknowledge this 
honestly and, boldly abandoning it, to shift to the creation of 
a confederative union of Eurasian states, keeping in mind that 
with time it could develop into a more durable national-state 
formation.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Kyasova: "KBR Judicial Body </F>
Presents Results"] 
  [Text] Last Friday the work results of the KBR 
[Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] People's Courts during the first 
half of 1993 were given at an extended meeting of the Ministry 
of Justice board and the KBR Supreme Court Presidium. The KBR 
Minister of Justice, A. M. Batyrbekov, who gave a detailed 
report, noted the particular significance of the activity of the 
People's Courts under circumstances in which crime issues in the 
republic are becoming more complex. During the period in 
question, 7,681 crimes were committed, a significant portion of 
which were classified as grave offenses. The number of 
infractions related to narcotic substances increased by 63 
percent. Persons convicted of crimes involving the use of 
firearms and ammunition totaled 132, while convictions for 
personal property theft grew by 12 percent. Also, 221 juveniles 
were brought to trial for various illegal acts. These statistics 
are more than just disconcerting, radical and decisive actions 
on the part of all law-upholding bodies are needed in order to 
turn the situation around and stop the rise in crime. How ready 
are our courts for this? As was explained, there is no simple 
answer. While giving proper due to the positive results attained 
in judicial proceedings, the minister of justice noted that the 
professional training and legal competence of certain 
judiciaries was cause for doubt. As a consequence there are 
delays, and dangerous criminals are released without 
consideration being given to the graveness of the crimes they 
have committed. 
  A. M Batyrbekov directed the attention of those gathered to 
shortcomings in the work of the marshalls of the court, and 
noted the necessity of increasing efforts in the area of legal 
education. 
  The deputy chairman of the KBR Supreme Court and chairman of 
the Board for Criminal Proceedings, A. S. Gelyakhov spoke on an 
analysis of criminal cases based on data from appellate courts 
and courts with supervisory authority. In his opinion, the 
Mayskiy People's Court was deserving of the most praise, as it 
had not even had one judgement reversed; a statement that could 
not be made about the Nalchik Municipal Court (presided over by 
V. Vybornov), the rulings of which were cited as "least stable." 
  In the opinion of A. S. Gelyakhov, cases in which citizens 
are wrongfully convicted, and equally, those in which the guilty 
are acquitted, do not further judiciaries' authority, but give 
rise to justified social protest. 
  The acting KBR Supreme Court chairman, Georgiy Alekseyevich 
Mamilov paused to discuss neglect in how civil cases are being 
reviewed. According to his information, virtually every third 
ruling on these types of cases was reversed in appellate 
proceedings. Viewing this kind of regard for one's work 
unacceptable, Mamilov spoke in favor of conducting a review and 
immediately releasing judiciaries noted for neglect. 
  Chairmen of Municipal and Rayon People's Courts S. A. 
Klyuyeva (city of Prokhladnyy), V. T. Vybornov (city of 
Nalchik), I. Kh. Topalov (city of Zalukonoazhe), V. M. Khushtov 
(city of Terek), A. F. Khazhnagoyev (city of Baksan), and 
several others talked about problems in need of attention, as 
well as their own views on how to resolve them. 
  The acting chief of the KBR MVD Investigation Directorate, 
Mukhamed Mussov answered a number of questions that arose during 
the exchange of opinions that took place, and pointed out the 
importance of close cooperation between judicial bodies, the 
militia, and the prosecutor's office. 
  We are all responsible for one thing, stressed KBR Minister 
of Internal Affairs Kh. A. Shogenov. He called on judiciaries to 
approach those who break the law and infringe upon the lives, 
honor and dignity of other men with the utmost strictness. In 
spite of differences of opinion on how to conduct the fight 
against crime, KBR Prosecutor R. I. Abazov said, the strategic 
focus of both judicial and law-upholding bodies is one and the 
same: to protect the population from criminal acts against them. 
It is in acknowledging this truth that we must proceed. 
  KBR Vice-President G. S. Gubin, having made a number of 
serious critical remarks directed at the the republic's courts, 
suggested the Minister of Justice demonstrate more consistency 
in selecting personnel and utilize the services of the 
qualifications commision more fully. 
  In spite of the impartial tone of the discourse, the finale 
was marked with a pleasant announcement. Gratitude was expressed 
for the results of the courts' work in 1993 and a monetary bonus 
was awarded in the sum of 100 thousand rubles by order of the 
republic minister of justice to the following judiciaries: A. A. 
Makoyev, L. A. Shapkinaya, V. S. Khashkutovaya, M. I. Olmezov, 
I. K. Borokov, L. A. Lesnykh, Kh. V. Kudryavtsevaya, V. B. 
Dogov, L. M. Martynovaya, G. I. Gorislavskaya, I. Kh. Topolov, 
B. Kh. Malbakhov. 
  KBR Prime Minister G. M. Cherkesov participated in the work 
of the meeting.

<F P=106> [Article by Z. Malbakhova: "Situation Under </F>
Control: From an MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Press 
Conference"] 
  [Text] A press conference took place in the assembly hall 
of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. The republic's Minister of Internal Affairs, Kh. A. 
Shogenov, and his deputies: Chief of Criminal Militia M. Kh. 
Zhigunov; Investigation Directorate Chief M. Kh. Abrokov, Chief 
of Personnel Management V. S. Popov, and MVD agency leaders 
answered questions posed by journalists from newspapers, 
television and radio. 
  In a brief address, Kh. A. Shogenov presented the primary 
results of the previous year's progress. Most importantly, he 
said, in the overall fight against crime they managed to keep 
the situation under control, although there was no dramatic 
change for the better. 
  In 1993, 7,681 crimes were recorded. Analysis has shown, 
said 
the minister, that offenses under ordinary law decreased by four 
percent, street crime and apartment theft indices went down, 
auto break-ins decreased by 11 percent, and auto theft by 37.6 
percent. 
  Kh. A. Shogenov noted that grave offenses, which grew in 
number during 1993 by 41.9 percent, were a cause for particular 
concern for the MVD. We are not satisfied with the work we have 
done, noted the minister. During the coming year we have a real 
opportunity for improvement. 
  Having noted that the number of homeless people on the 
streets has increased, and weapons have spread throughout the 
republic, a ZAMAN newspaper correspondent questioned the 
minister about how the MVD plans to combat these phenomena. 
  With a growth in the number of people out of work, the 
number 
of crimes will also increase, answered Kh. A. Shogenov. A big 
problem and a major task is to assist those previously convicted 
returning from detention camps to find employment. It is namely 
these people, unable to find a place for themselves in our 
society, who retrace their steps back to the world of crime. 
  The minister also stated that an average of 20 firearms are 
confiscated each day. Where they once originated in Abkhazia, 
firearms are now primarily coming from Ossetia, Ingushetia, and 
the Chechen Republic. 
  A second question asked by the newspaper ZAMAN touched upon 
the MVD's work on repatriating the Balkarian people. 
  The ministry's work on this issue was acknowledged by its 
leader as being most productive. In no republic is activity of 
its kind proceeding at such a rapid pace as in 
Kabardino-Balkaria. 
  In response to a question posed by a KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA 
PRAVDA newspaper journalist about how much organized crime rings 
have decreased this year over last, the minister said that there 
are no exact figures as to their overall number because the 
rings themselves have an unstable character. One of the reasons 
the fight against organized crime has not yet taken on an 
offensive posture is that the main MVD department handling this 
type of work is understaffed. 
  There are three stages of combating organized crime. The 
first is to gain knowledge and control of such groups, and break 
them up. The second is to arrest and try, and the third is to 
execute. In 1993 several members of organized crime rings were 
executed. Several others were put out of commission, convicted, 
or are under investigation. 
  "Where is the counterfeit money in the republic 
originating?" 
In a response to this question posed by SEVERNYY KAVKAZ, it was 
said that the "goods" were primarily being brought in from the 
Chechen and Ingush Republics. Quite recently 75 million 
counterfeit rubles were discovered in the city of Prokhladnyy. 
Three women were among those dealing in the latter. 
  The range of problems touched upon at the press conference 
was quite broad. The newspaper SINDIKA INFORM reproached the 
forms and methods of work applied by the MVD when ethical norms 
for behavior are ignored. The republic minister of internal 
affairs replied that the militia is a part of society, which 
reflects the trends and processes occurring in society as a 
whole. However, he said, at present it has become possible to 
cease recruiting employees, and implement a selection process 
that will invariably help to put the best people in the job. 
  A SOVIETSKAYA MOLODEZH correspondent asked about an incident 
during the MVD's pursuit of the criminal Malkanduyev in the 
Volnyy Aul region, when one of the people involved in the chase, 
A. Iritov, was injured from an explosion. The minister explained 
that the incident was the result of an accident, and that the 
ringleader was not successfully apprehended. However, another 
well known criminal, Bashiyev, nicknamed "Spartak" was arrested 
and is being examined. 
  "How is the MVD combatting racketeering?" This question was 
given by a republic radio journalist. 
  If enterprise leaders, from whom criminals extort huge sums 
of money, turn to us for help, as did the chemical plant 
"Iskozh," they will in the future be protected from these types 
of offenses. However, we have no pity for those leaders who 
allow themselves to be led around by racketeers. We know the 
reasons why these people do not turn to the militia for help. 
  "The figures for auto theft are quite high in our republic. 
What is being done in this regard?" asked a radio broadcast 
journalist. 
  Success in this area of our work, as perhaps in no other, 
said Chief of Criminal Militia M. Kh. Zhigunov, depends on 
coordination and close cooperation between agencies. At the 
present time a new subdivision is being created which will serve 
to coordinate this type of MVD activity. 
  "Could the Ministry of Internal Affairs give its own answer 
as to why it is virtually impossible to obtain credits at the 
bank? After all, large sums are being appropriated to fill this 
need." A KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent touched upon 
this problem. 
  In giving an explanation, the chief of the MVD Directorate 
for Economic Crimes, Yu. Kokov, said that virtually all credit 
resources at commercial banks are, in one form or another, state 
funds. The latter is comprised of centralized credits from the 
bank of Russia, deposit funds from enterprises and 
organizations, and the free balance in accounts, with the 
exception of the small portion which comes from the population. 
  However, bank employees do not carefully review letters of 
guarantee or insurance coverage. They do not verify the 
reliability or credit worthiness of clients, their guarantors, 
or even the existence of firms themselves. 
  There have been incidents in which nonexistent structures, 
land parcels, cars and other property have been used as a 
security and considerable credit funds have been granted. 
  As a result on January 1 this year past due debt on bank 
loans came to more than 11 billion rubles. 
  Khakimov, a Chechen Republic resident, for example, 
temporarily registered in community housing in the city of 
Nalchik. He registered the "Martan" firm at this address, having 
opened an account at the "Evraziya [Eurasia]" commercial bank. 
However, having received credits in the sum of 20 million 
rubles, he absconded with the money. 
  Unfortunately, there are many examples of these types of 
incidents that one could give; incidents that have occurred at 
virtually all of the republic's commercial banks. 
  Having squandered funds, yet convinced that they were 
deceived, bank leaders are turning to us for help. For the 
commercial bank "Nalchik" alone we secured the return of 224 
million rubles that had been given up as unrecoverable debt. A 
considerable sum, however, still remains irretrievable. 
  For these reasons criminal proceedings have been instituted 
and a search initiated for debtors throughout all of Russia and 
the CIS countries. 
  Difficulties with obtaining credit and searches for such 
"clients" are problems created by bank leaders and employees. 
However, it does not have to be this way, in which case we more 
than likely would not have to ask why all these bankers took 
such risks.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Toporkov, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA </F>
correspondent in Tambov: "The Governor Has Become Enraged; War 
With Oblast Soviet Continues in Tambov"] 
  [Text] It was difficult to find the open room on the third 
floor of the old private residential house in the center of 
Tambov, over which the Russian tri-colored flag still shudders 
dimly and shamefully. All the others were locked tight and 
sealed with several seals. But in this one room was the entire 
apparatus of the oblast soviet, all of the representative 
people's power. I could not help but think: Here it is, the last 
redoubt of the Tambov deputies. 
  It was no accident that this military terminology came to 
mind. What has been going on in Tambov during recent months is 
reminiscent of fierce battles. Here the head of oblast 
administration, V. Babenko, has declared a real war against the 
soviets. But if it were only a war of words... 
  Vladimir Dmitriyevich is conducting the siege of the Tambov 
"White House" on a broad scale, using the subdivisions of the 
militia, the mass media, and threats to cut off the deputies' 
telephone service. In general, the entire experience of 
Krasnopresnenskaya embankment has been taken into the arsenal, 
except that there are no devoted Taman followers in Tambov and 
they are not shooting at the building from tanks. Also, the 
plumbing works. 
  What sins have the Tambov deputies committed before Mr. 
Governor? Here we must take a short excursion into the past. 
  V. Babenko assumed the chair of the head of administratipon 
after the events of August 1991 which were victorious for the 
"democrats." The chief physician of the oblast hospital, a 
urologist by education, he at first conducted himself loyally in 
regard to the oblast soviet. Vladimir Dmitriyevich liked to 
emphasize the fact that there was complete peace and mutual 
understanding in the relations of the local executive and 
representative power, and that together they have only one noble 
goal--to show concern for the people's welfare. 
  It is true, however, the welfare of the people was ever 
dwindling, and it was necessary to find a "scapegoat." And so 
they found one, particularly since the events of 
September-October thundered in Moscow. Here the power of 
Vladimir Dmitriyevich unfolded to its full extent, as well as 
that of the president's representative, V. Davituliani. The 
latter directly announced in the pages of the press that "it is 
specifically A. Ryabov (the chairman of the oblast soviet--V. 
T.) who bears the main responsibility for the failures in the 
economy, since he... subordinated the oblast administration to 
himself." V. Babenko found another accusation. He exposed the 
oblast soviet in its anti-governmental, anti-presidential and 
confrontational position. 
  Mr. Babenko did not specifically decipher the manner in 
which 
this "terrible position" was expressed, believing that it was 
enough simply to issue the verdict: As of 22 October, to cease 
the activity of the Tambov Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies 
and its agencies. It is true, the decree also spoke of one other 
reason for the impossibility of the oblast soviet's 
implementation of its functions--"due to the absence of a quorum 
as a result of the mass resignation of its deputies from their 
powers and authorities." We will return to this accusation, but 
for now we must remind the honorable Vladimir Dmitriyevich that 
no later than 11 October the session of the oblast soviet 
adopted by a two-thirds vote the decision not to include the 
question of self-dissolution on the agenda. Only six deputies 
supported this proposal. 
  That is when the pressure on the deputies started. Their 
official statements began to come in, which were brought by 
special messengers from the rayons. But without waiting for the 
decision of the mandate commission on the correctness of these 
statements, the governor publicized his decree at the meeting of 
the minor soviet. Naturally, the minor soviet found it to be 
unlawful, and on the basis of the Russian Federation law, "On 
the Kray Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies and the Kray Oblast 
Administration" (no one has repealed this law even to this day), 
the minor soviet appealed to the Russian Federation Procurator 
General and the oblast procurator with the request to answer: 
Are such actions by the head of administration legal? 
  The Procurator General of Russia, A. Kazannik, kept quiet in 
this affair. However, the oblast deputy procurator, V. Amelin, 
directly announced that since the minor soviet repealed the 
decree issued by the head of the oblast procurator's office, he 
finds no grounds for intervention. Although it is written 
somewhat ingeniously, it is not difficult to deduce the fact 
that the procurator's office holds the actions of the minor 
soviet to be correct. 
  It would seem that this should be the end of the Tambov 
battles. But no, this merely egged the governor on to new 
skirmishes. Speaking at a press conference, he openly announced 
that, of all the political problems today, the question of 
liquidating the soviets of all levels stands in first place. And 
that was the beginning of it all. The financing of the oblast 
soviet was cut off, the automobiles were "arrested", and then 
the phones were disconnected. As of 1 November, the oblast 
soviet apparatus has been placed on leave for a month and a 
half. And although such a term is not indicated in any KZOT 
[Code of Laws on Labor], nevertheless this did not trouble the 
head of administration. He generously paid, out of the 
taxpayer's pockets, the month-and-a-half idle time of the 
people, many of whom, we might add, had already taken their 
regular vacations even before. 
  This saga was further continued on 16 December. As described 
in the local press, it was specifically on this day that they 
were met at the oblast soviet building with sealed doors of 
offices and a reinforced militia guard. It is true, some people, 
as they say, were able to slip into the building. Deputy Head of 
Administration I. Filatyev assured them that all would be placed 
in jobs within the course of the present day. 
  Mr. Filatyev was evidently hasty in this announcement. Even 
today, not all the workers have been placed in jobs. But that is 
not all. Who gave permission to violate the labor legislation in 
the most blatant manner, to nullify the presidential edict of 26 
November 1993, which clearly states that a change in the staff 
numbers and structure of the apparatus of the Soviet of People's 
Deputies is not permitted in the period prior to start of work 
of the new representative organ? 
  I believe that Mr. Babenko's attitude at that time was 
definitely influenced by the results of the elections to the 
Federal Assembly. They turned out to be rather pathetic for the 
Tambov "democrats." Having understood where the gentlemen from 
Babenko's command were leading the oblast, the voters gave them, 
in the words of Sholokhov, "a complete thrashing." People who 
were not subject to political twists and turns were elected to 
the Federal Assembly. Among them was A. Ryabov, the chairman of 
the oblast soviet. 
  Here it is time to say a few words about the chairman of the 
soviet. Aleksandr Ivanovich worked his whole life in the Tambov 
area. He is a candidate of science and enjoys great authority 
among the people. And he entered the elections with a precise 
and clear program of preserving people's power, implementing 
social justice and protecting the interests of the people. We 
might add that he registered not as the former, but as the 
currently acting chairman, and the people appraised the true 
worth of Ryabov's civic courage. He won by a large margin, 
beating out that very same Babenko and the people from his 
command. 
  This blow to his self-esteem rocked V. Babenko. He hastily 
announced in the press that conclusions would be drawn also in 
regard to the activity of the oblast agricultural 
administration, the newspaper TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN and the 
experienced economic managers. Many of them did not reject their 
nomenclature predilections and, in essence, had dealt a stab to 
the back, announced the governor. 
  The situation in the oblast is leading to poverty. Here are 
but a few figures. Today there are already more than 13,000 
officially registered unemployed persons in the oblast. This is 
two or three times more than in neighboring oblasts. The volume 
of industrial production has declined by 10.3 percent in a year, 
and fewer consumer goods were produced. And here is the 
situation in the rural areas. Meat production has declined by 21 
percent during the year, milk--by almost 7 percent, and wool--by 
22 percent. The herd size of all types of livestock is 
declining. Investments in the national economy have declined by 
32 percent, and the operational introduction of automobile roads 
has declined by 46 percent. 
  The representative of the president, Mr. V. Davituliani, 
best 
summed up the truth, I believe. In a lengthy announcement 
regarding the situation, addressed to President B. Yeltsin, he 
writes that the old and new bureaucrats are hindering the 
reforms which threaten to take power out of their hands. "It was 
you, Boris Nikolayevich, who imposed this power! Did the people 
dream of such power when they supported you in 1991?" 
  As they say, you can't put it any better than that! 
  So, the problem is not in the deputies. Nevertheless, the 
Tambov governor continues to "storm" his "white house." Having 
learned that a meeting of the minor soviet was slated for 15 
February, V. Babenko urgently "took measures." At 3 o'clock in 
the morning, under the cover of the militia, the doors to the 
oblast soviet were once again sealed. And this after the oblast 
court of arbitration found the decree by the head of 
administration on terminating the financing of the oblast 
soviet, on the upcoming lay-off of workers of the apparatus, and 
on the attitude toward the newspaper TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN to be 
invalid, and after the court decision was handed down to return 
the building to the deputies. 
  Nevertheless, the minor soviet did hold its meeting. It 
adopted a decision on measures for ensuring the safekeeping of 
the soviet's property, reviewed information on the arbitration 
court ruling, and repealed the 2 February decree issued by the 
head of administration, "On the System of Organs of State Power 
in Tambov Oblast." Almost immediately there followed a statement 
by the administration press service, saying that this decision 
is nothing other than a statement by a group of private 
individuals, and will not be implemented by the organs of 
executive power. These actions are qualified as being directed 
toward the destabilization of the socio-political situation in 
the oblast. No more and no less! Evidently, under pressure from 
some forces, the arbitration court also suspended the 
implementation of its ruling, forgetting even to specify the 
term of this suspension. 
  In short, the storming of the building on Internatsionalnaya 
Street continues. Babenko is also not embarrassed about the 
tyranny in regard to Federation Council member A. Ryabov. During 
the days when I was in Tambov, the telephone in the room 
assigned to him did not work. Not to mention the fact that he 
had been deprived of transportation, harried and exhausted by 
the terrible strain on his nerves. 
  Meanwhile, as before, people are going to the oblast soviet, 
as before with questions of the most vital importance. They also 
do not conceal their attitude toward the tyranny of the 
administration. This, roughly, is how N. Perepegin, an engineer 
and deputy of the oblast soviet, Deputy V. Drozdovich, a former 
scientific associate of one of the institutes, and others with 
whom I had occasion to meet characterized Babenko's actions. 
  Yet the people are worried not only about the tyranny of the 
executive power against the soviets. The elections to the oblast 
duma are coming up soon in Tambov. Only thanks to the 
intervention of the minor soviet was it possible to double the 
size of this agency and to eliminate numerous violations of the 
effective legislation. But the gentlemen-democrats are once 
again bent on their own. Once again they are pushing their 
Tambov fellow citizens toward confrontation. For example, the 
mayor of the city of Tambov and leader of the "Democratic 
Russia" movement, V. Koval, had submitted the TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN 
program even at the last elections. It is quite obvious that 
some parties cannot be allowed to participate in the elections. 
In no case must the electoral commissions register 
representatives of the patriotic movement "Otechestvo" 
["Homeland"] or any communist structures, regardless of what 
flag they may emerge under. Such an announcement has a wild 
smell about it. 
  Then again, the leaders of the Tambov "democrats" are not 
only making political announcements. They are acting 
unceremoniously. One of the workers of the oblast soviet told me 
how, in his presence, in Mordovskiy Rayon the head of 
administration sent a militia detachment to interfere with the 
meeting of a candidate for deputy in the Federal Assembly, 
Aleksey Ponomarev, with the voters. It is a good thing that 
Aleksey Alekseyevich turned out to be not of the timid sort (he 
managed to stay in the beseiged House of Soviets on Krasnaya 
Presna until the last hour), and forced the zealous militiamen 
to leave. 
  There is currently a fuss going on around the 
people's-patriotic electoral association "Rus," which unites 
representatives of over ten parties and movements. The 
association had a lease agreement with the "Avangard" House of 
Culture for several rooms which it needed to conduct business 
with voters. After several threatening phone calls, the director 
hastened to break this agreement. 
  Pressure is also being exerted on the mass media. Even on 2 
November, the head of oblast administration issued a decree on 
handing over to the administration the powers and authorities of 
the oblast soviet in regard to the newspaper TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN. 
The decree unceremoniously assigns the resolution of the 
question of handing over the newspaper's state property, as well 
as the question of co-foundership by the oblast administration. 
In this situation, the journalists have not yet flinched, but no 
one knows how things will be in the future. 
  ...This year there is a snowy, frost-bitten winter in the 
Tambov region. In the city, which, it seems, has long ago been 
neglected by the politicians, one cannot even get through along 
the main roads. But the snowstorms are raging not only in 
nature. They are also devastating the souls of the people, 
before whose very eyes the scenes of destruction of the soviets 
are being played out and the will of the people is being flouted. 
  No sooner had I written the last lines of this 
correspondence 
than I received a phone call from Tambov. A. Chubushev, section 
head of the oblast soviet called and bitterly informed me that 
the governor had made the decision to hand the oblast soviet 
building over to the humanitarian institute. That means there 
will be new battles. It is a shame that, amidst all the 
political battles, we are losing sight of the individual, for 
whom life is not sweet.

<F P=106> [Article by staff correspondent Irina Chernova: "Achtung! </F>
Achtung! The Secret of Esteemed Frau Kopel's Success Lies in the 
Millions"]] 
  [Text] Volgograd--They pleaded: do not harm us. If Germany 
refuses us help, we will have nothing else to put our hopes in. 
Our children have no native tongue. Our adults are the most 
uneducated nation in the country. There are no churches left for 
our believers. But who today wants to have anything to do with 
these trivial problems? If Germany, too, refuses help, we will 
have no future in Russia. 
  They pleaded: tell the truth. For it is even worse to live 
in 
a lie than it is to live in poverty. And with the consent of the 
people who trusted me, I am choosing the honest truth. 
  Throughout the past four years the question of Russian 
Germans as a repressed and not entirely rehabilitated people was 
a stumbling block for the two countries' politicians, for the 
public and for individual citizens. Passions seethed, dozens of 
conferences were held, and journalists engaged in furious 
debate. A separate republic. An autonomous national cultural 
entity. Renaissance. The desert lands of Elton. Practically 
everything imaginable was proposed to solve these problems. And 
the Soviet Germans quietly gathered their belongings and left 
for the West. 
  Two hundred and fifty years ago their ancestors had fled 
Germany to Russia. Because things were bad there and good here. 
Now things are good there and bad here. And people always are 
pulled to where things are better. In 1989 100,000 Germans left 
the Soviet homeland. In 1993, about 200,000 left. As a rule, 
these are skilled workers and the most industrious peasants. 
There are few members of the intelligentsia among them. That is 
because as of the beginning of the 1990s only about four Soviet 
Germans in 100 had a higher education. 
  Today no one speaks any longer about an autonomous entity. 
The explosion of ethnic conflicts has cooled the hottest heads. 
  Today on the intergovernmental level projects of ordinary 
socioeconomic and cultural development of the territories where 
there are concentrations of Russian Germans are being proposed 
and carried out. Germany is giving special attention to the 
Volga region. Equipment for schools, hospitals and mini plants 
is being sent there, along with equipment for private farmers 
and humanitarian aid. We spoke with those to whom this aid is 
directed and heard: "No one needs us--neither Russia nor 
Germany." These attitudes are especially strong in Volgograd 
Oblast. 
  "Our taxpayers' money is being spent uselessly in Russia." A 
scandal over this matter, after gradually ripening, suddenly 
burst into the open, stirring up not only the upper echelons of 
power but also Germany's public opinion. The most popular 
publications started talking about Germany's having gotten 
bogged down in Russian problems. 
  Investigators from the Federal Accounting House, analyzing 
reports on aid to Russian Germans, discovered that the financial 
investments did not accord with existing expenditures. Millions 
of deutsche marks had disappeared altogether, and no one knew 
where. The state prosecutor got involved in the case. 
  And everything had started in 1990, when, under the pressure 
of the fourth wave of emigration from the Soviet Union and the 
problem of determining the status of the eastern lands, 
Germany's government reached the conclusion that it was better 
to aid Russian Germans within Russia itself than to help them 
migrate to the FRG. All that needed to be done was to create the 
necessary conditions for the development of their own culture 
and education and provide them with economic support, and 
everything would be fine. 
  A Mr. Waffenschmidt, the German Ministry of the Interior's 
official in charge of immigrant affairs, was assigned the job of 
preparing the project and carrying it out with the help of 
Soviet Germans. However, not having any concept of his own on 
this account, the civil servant shifted the burden of the 
problems onto the Association for Germans Abroad (VDA), turning 
it into his money courier. Today Karsten Slamelcher, VDA's 
federal secretary, has been sent on an indefinite leave that 
looks very much like a permanent separation. His further fate 
depends on the results of an investigation. However, Germany's 
prosecutor will hardly succeed in finding the ends of all the 
German money lost in Russia without help from Russia itself. In 
any case, our attempt to conduct our own journalistic 
investigation in Volgograd, where a VDA bureau has been 
operating for two years, led to the surprising conclusion: the 
truth about the money has no place whatsoever among the 
interests of the local civil servants. 
  The VDA bureau was set up in the spring of 1992 in 
Volgograd. 
A certain citizen from Ulyanovsk who calls herself Frau Kopel, 
became the head of it. The history of the frau's appearance and 
activities in Volgograd is mysterious. While spending a 
half-year in VDA courses in Germany, the Russian citizen 
Svetlana Kopel gained the support and trust of Mr. Slamelcher. 
After returning to Russia, she became acquainted with yet 
another influential "comrade," Anatoliy Yegin, Volgograd 
Oblast's deputy governor for ethnic questions. By mutual 
agreement of the two men, Svetlana moved to Volgograd, where she 
opened and became head of the VDA bureau, which is supposed to 
implement the program of aid to Russian Germans on behalf of the 
German government. 
  For reasons known only to her, the Frau did not register the 
bureau, did not open a bank account, and herself obtained no 
residence permit in Volgograd, remaining officially employed in 
the Saratov Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Under Russian 
laws, this means that the VDA company in Volgograd does not 
exist, and the frau herself is not a resident and taxpayer of 
that city. 
  Through unknown means, but most likely not without the help 
of Yegin, she managed to obtain permission and have a seal of 
the Volgograd VDA bureau made. The firm does not exist, but its 
seal does. So she could get to work. 
  In accordance with an intergovernmental agreement, Germany 
pledged to finance the construction in eight Volgograd villages 
of 800 cottages for immigrants from the former USSR. Naturally, 
the homes were intended primarily for Russian Germans. The 
overall expenditures required investments of more than 8 million 
DM. Our country assumed obligations to build the infrastructure 
for the revived villages. The total expenditures are unknown. 
Volgograd Oblast's Deputy Governor Yegin was in charge of the 
project on Russia's behalf. Frau Kopel was in charge of it on 
Germany's behalf. 
  In the summer of 1992, Yegin, who knows nothing about 
construction, singlehandedly distributed the most profitable 
contracts, for which foreign exchange had been allocated, among 
local companies. "Who has what proposals?" 
  There were proposals. In certain cases the cost of houses 
grew to more than one and one-half times what had been planned. 
Once again, the reasons are unknown. 
  The participants in this highly unique "competition" 
included 
the owner of the VEST Individual Private Enterprise, a 
well-known former knitwear factory shop chief named Karapetyan. 
He got a contract to build 65 houses in the village of Umet for 
a total cost of 3.2 million marks. Yegin's decision to enlist 
Karapetyan in the German project is yet another riddle, since 
prior to June 1993 VEST had no license for construction work, 
and the deadline for fulfilling the contract expired in 
November. But Kopel approved the contract, paying an advance of 
620,000 marks--part of it in cash. 
  When a German government delegation visited the village of 
Umet in November 1993, it was horrified: foundation pits that 
had been dug for 17 houses and foundations that had been laid 
were filled with ground water. There was hardened cement. Here 
and there stacks of broken brick had been laid with the mastery 
of primordial man. And this was 190,000 marks' worth. The 
Germans dissolved the contract and demanded that the advance of 
620,000 marks be returned. No one has returned the money to them. 
  Incidentally, seven out of the eight contracts handed out by 
the generous hand of Yegin have still not been carried out. 
Although the deadline for their fulfillment has long since 
passed. 
  In 18 months of life in Volgograd, Frau Kopel's wealth 
increased with cosmic speed. It is possible that not only the 
German government's lack of oversight over the expenditure of 
funds in Russia, but also the VDA Volgograd bureau's lack of a 
bank account contributed to this. 
  The frau brought hundreds of thousands of marks from Germany 
to Volgograd in nothing more than a suitcase. Out of this truly 
golden suitcase, she withdrew personally for herself tax-free 
wages of 4,600 marks. Incidentally, not a single one of the 
executives of Russia's other VDA agencies earns so much. The 
suitcase also produced a bonus of 8,000 marks and then 30,000 
marks for the purchase of the apartment where Svetlana's mama 
now lives. This, incidentally, is also a unique phenomenon--none 
of the executives of the other Russian bureaus has received 
money for the acquisition of housing. 
  Money from the same suitcase was used to acquire four motor 
vehicles for the needs of the Volgograd VDA bureau. Only they 
were registered, with Slamelcher's permission, in the name of 
Frau Kopel and are kept in her personal garage. This four-car 
garage is attached to the two-story home that Svetlana has also 
managed to acquire in 18 months of living in Volgograd. And the 
more the frau's property grew, the more incomprehensible events 
occurred in the VDA bureau. 
  First a very valuable computer disappeared, and then a fax 
machine, and then certain other small items. On the other hand, 
the firm's rolls include people whom no one has ever seen. The 
bureau's employees have dubbed them "dead souls." However, the 
"dead" contrived to get their pay in foreign exchange. They 
included, for example, the director of the Saratov Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry and certain other interesting citizens. 
Only suddenly something unforeseen happened: part of the report 
documents disappeared from the VDA office. This was connected 
with a scandal in Germany, which broke out at the end of 1993. 
  The FRG Federal Accounting House demanded a report on the 
budget-financed money that had been spent in Russia. And 
delegations from the German Ministry of the Interior became 
frequent visitors in Volgograd. They did not want to hear any 
more of Mr. Yegin's eloquent discussion, and they demanded that 
they be taken to visit the construction projects and the schools 
and enterprises where German equipment had been installed. 
  Slamelcher's position became shaky. Yegin's was not yet. 
  The frightened Slamelcher sent a telex to Volgograd: "The 
contract with Kopel is dissolved. She is not to be allowed to 
work with documents until the new bureau director arrives and 
affairs are turned over to him." This was on 23 December 1993. 
And on 24 December Kopel appeared in the firm's office in the 
accompaniment of a man. He showed VDA employees his credentials: 
"Maj Shcherbak, chief of the Ninth Division of the Central Rayon 
Department of Internal Affairs." Together they opened sealed 
doors of the director's office, put something in a suitcase, and 
left. The raid, covered by the officer's epaulets, was repeated 
two more times. And once again, a suitcase was carried off. 
During all this time the major was officially on leave. After 
the second visit of Kopel and Shcherbak, the VDA employees wrote 
a complaint to the militia. It disappeared. During the third 
visit they called the OMON special militia. In the presence of 
armed officers, the "raiders" laid the valuables they had taken 
on the table. They turned out to be contracts for the lease of 
tractors that Germany had turned over to Volgograd farmers, 
certain contracts with "dead souls," and reports on the 
allocation of humanitarian aid and medical equipment. They were 
all confiscated as evidence by the Central Rayon Department of 
Internal Affairs "in the interest of the investigation," and the 
bank packages of currency--70,000 DM, about $2,000, and several 
million rubles--were also sent to the same place. 
  A couple of weeks later Mr. Tsilke, the new director of the 
Volgograd VDA, demanded that the militia return the firm's 
property. The money was returned. Not to the VDA, however, but 
to citizen Kopel. The investigator's explanation was murderous 
in its logic: "The lady said that the money belonged to her." 
And the "lady said" also that as soon as she left the militia 
office she was robbed immediately, so she no longer has 
possession of either the marks or the dollars. 
  One could tell something else about the humanitarian aid 
from 
Germany that was sold through the rayon trading organization, 
with the money earned subsequently being loaned at interest. And 
about how that aid was selectively unloaded at Lebyazhye Field 
from Boeings into the cars of civil servants from Yegin's 
department. One could also tell a lot about the exchange of 
delegations of schoolchildren, who for some reason were 
accompanied to Germany by those same civil servants and their 
wives. But all that is small potatoes, and all in the past. 
  Our task--to show the scale of the abuses connected with the 
provision of aid to Russian Germans living on the territory of 
Volgograd--has proved impossible to accomplish. It is already 
virtually impossible to find the German money that has been lost 
in Russia. 
  The Russian Germans still have draft programs for the 
revival 
of their own culture and for the social and economic development 
of the territories in which concentrations of them reside. The 
programs, however, are based not on humanitarian assistance but 
on the establishment of joint ventures. But local civil servants 
do not want to hear of these proposals. It is more interesting 
for them to tackle the problems of Russian Germans without the 
Russian Germans themselves, so that they can satisfy their own 
personal requirements in the course of the business. And in the 
broader sense, both sides are to blame for this. Germany--for 
the fact that it was too trusting of its own and another 
country's civil servants. Russia--for the fact that it shifted 
the problems of its own citizens onto the shoulders of Germany. 
The color photos spread out on the VDA desk show a smiling and 
embracing Yegin and Kopel, who is not a frau at all but citizen 
Smirnova, who kept the name of her former husband--a Russian 
German. As for Maj Shcherbak, he is living peaceably under the 
same roof with the former frau. It's such a close-knit 
collective. 
<H5>  The Story Continues </H5>
  At a session of a Russian-German intergovernmental 
commission 
that just began the other day in Bonn, one of the most urgent 
questions will be that of implementing the Russian Federation 
president's 21 February 1992 edict "On Urgent Measures for the 
Rehabilitation of the Russian Germans." In many respects, 
relations between the governments of Russia and Germany will 
depend on the extent to which progress is made in creating the 
German national territorial formations provided for by the 
edict. As will the nature of the economic assistance in settling 
Russian Germans in Volgograd Oblast. The government delegation 
will include Anatoliy Yegin, deputy governor of Volgograd Oblast.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Korney: "Battles Over Reconciliation </F>
Monument"] 
  [Text] Representatives of the Volgograd Oblast 
organizations of the Russian Federation Communist Party, the 
All-Russian Communist Party of Bolsheviks, the Russian National 
Union, and the Congress of Soviet Women held a special press 
conference to announce that they had not changed their stance: 
"The sacred ground of Stalingrad is not the place for the 
so-called reconciliation monument." They were referring to the 
scheduled dedication of a pillar--a "symbol of 
reconciliation"--in Volgograd on 14 May, almost half a century 
after the end of the war, in accordance with a Russian-Austrian 
agreement. The campaign against the monument, according to the 
organizers of the press conference, is being joined by the whole 
leftwing and communist press. Petitions have already been 
printed. Signatures will be collected by the party obkom. 
Activists will also go to enterprises to collect signatures. 
  An open letter from the Central Council of the Officers 
Union 
"To the Veterans of the Battle of Stalingrad, Public Veterans 
Organizations, Patriotic Movements, and Patriots of Russia" is 
being distributed to protest "the erection of a monument that is 
hostile to our people." 
  A delegation from Austria, headed by Vice President Walter 
Seledetz of the "50th Anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad" 
committee and Vice President Hugo Mueller of the "Black Cross" 
society, was in Volgograd at the time. The "Black Cross," which 
is leading the search for the remains of soldiers who fell in 
battle, will also be erecting the pillar in Volgograd. 
  It is supposed to have the following inscription: "This 
monument is dedicated to all of the victims of the Battle of 
Stalingrad of 1942-1943. It is a reminder of the suffering of 
the soldiers and civilians who fell here. The monument was 
erected with contributions from the Austrian people. We ask that 
the soldiers from Germany, Austria, and all other countries who 
fell here be granted eternal peace on Russian land." 
  The Austrian delegation held a press conference to voice the 
same request for "eternal peace on Russian land." There was one 
other interesting detail: The "Black Cross," according to Hugo 
Mueller, has learned the identity of all of the Soviet soldiers 
who died in Austria. The number turned out to be much higher 
than the figures in official records. More than a thousand 
requests have already been received from people wishing to 
attend the dedication ceremony for the "symbol of 
reconciliation" on 14 May. 
  The organizers of the protest campaign are alleging that the 
Volgograd administration decided in secret to erect the monument 
and to locate it in the square in the center of the city. 
  "There was nothing secret about it," Volgograd 
Administration 
Deputy Chief Svetlana Antonova responded. "There was constant 
coverage of the talks and the preparations for the dedication 
ceremony in the local press. Apparently, however, the time is 
right for a political campaign." 
  The leaders of the "opposition" to the reconciliation 
monument are not certain they have the support of the majority 
of people in Volgograd, however, and are willing to compromise: 
They would agree to a monument, and even a chapel, outside the 
city limits. 
  I do not wish to offend the veterans who bore the weight of 
the war, but will the "symbol of reconciliation" and the request 
for "eternal peace on Russian land" really diminish their 
distinction? Nevertheless, the constant propaganda has even 
divided the veterans themselves. 
  At the end of last week Volgograd Mayor Yuriy Chekhov met 
representatives of public organizations and political parties to 
discuss the issue of the reconciliation monument. The appeals of 
the mayor and democratic parties for the avoidance of 
confrontations were rejected. A new phase of the campaign 
began--a move to the exertion of strong pressure on government 
officials.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Nikolayev, president of the Republic of </F>
Sakha (Yakutia), under rubric "Position": "Peoples of the North: 
Prospects for Common Development. Yakutia Sets a Good Example"] 
  [Text] By and large, all of the problems in the North are a 
human problem. Primarily, the problem of the northerner -- a 
person living in the planet's high latitudes. Nevertheless I 
shall never get tired or trying to prove, or of repeating, that 
the problems of the North were and will continue to be problems 
of a scale that affects mankind as a whole. Having recognized 
that truth, we shall move far ahead along the path primarily of 
humanism. 
  In the Russian Federation and in the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia) in recent years there have been major changes in the 
entire way of life and it is impossible to evaluate in any 
simple manner the importance of those changes for the peoples of 
the North. However, the value of the reforms manifests itself 
precisely against the background of the overall condition and 
well-being of the peoples of the North. 
  Upon attentive consideration it is revealed that the 
northern 
peoples of our planet not only assimilated for mankind a vast 
territory that is unbelievably severe and also very rich in 
resources, but also created a unique spiritual and material 
culture. One can confidently speak about a specific circumpolar 
(existing in the regions of the Arctic Circle) civilization that 
enriched mankind by its invaluable historical experience, an 
experience that reveals man's ability to survive and to engage 
in creative activity under the most severe climatic conditions. 
  For Russia this experience is unusually important, or even 
invaluable, for the simple reason that 60 percent of Russian 
territory is nothing but an arctic and northern zone. For the 
Republic of Sakha this experience is national wealth, property 
that belongs to the entire nation, the dividends from which we 
shall receive in the twenty-first century, when we shall see the 
fruition of the words of the great Lomonosov, to the effect that 
Russia's might will accrue to Siberia and the Arctic Ocean. 
  The peoples that formed the circumpolar civilization have 
many attributes in common, such as a harmonious, completely 
balanced interrelationship with the fragile environment. The 
northern peoples created great models of economic culture, the 
fruits of which the industrial part of mankind is just beginning 
to use. The cult of life, the recognition of the inherent value 
of life, collectivism, mutual tolerance and mutual aid, respect 
for women, the family, and the tribe, heightened aesthetic 
sense, a sense of beauty -- those are only a few of the shared 
and special attributes of northern civilization. 
  The North's vast mineral wealth became the chief reason for 
invading and destroying the fragile circumpolar civilization, 
for having it become absorbed by industrial civilization. A 
large amount of harm was inflicted on the peoples of the North 
by the social experiment that was carried out in Russia after 
October 1917 under the slogan of the building of a communist 
society. The industrial breakthrough to the unlimited natural 
resources of the northern territories was accompanied by a 
disdain for the peoples populating those lands, by the 
incompetent interference of the state and officials into the 
social and spiritual life of the northern peoples. 
  At various stages in the development of Russia, the 
effectiveness of administering the northern territories varied. 
The first and most significant legal act, in our opinion, was 
the Regulations for Administering Aliens, which were enacted in 
1822. Tribal communes were recognized as being the basis of 
self-government and the subject of land use. Under the Soviet 
authority the freedom of national associations of northerners 
was declared: in the early 1930's the Presidium of the VTsIK 
[All-Russian Central Executive Committee] even enacted a decree 
entitled Organizing National Associations in the Rayons 
Inhabited by Small-Population Nationalities of the North. For 
example, 15 national rayons were formed as part of the Yakut 
ASSR of that time. Officially that decree was never appealed, 
but it was also never executed. For Russia as a whole, those 
rayons were gradually deprived of their national status, and 
that fact, combined with other unfavorable factors, led to a 
decline in the development of the northern peoples and to a loss 
by them of many achievements of circumpolar civilization. 
  The restoration of Russia, the reformation of all aspects of 
its life at the present-day stage, creates excellent 
opportunities for overcoming the mistakes that were made. And 
the experience of Yakutia that was gained in recent years 
inspires optimism. 
  According to the data in the 1989 population census, there 
were 24,817 persons residing on the territory of the Republic of 
Sakha (Yakutia) -- representatives of 25 of the 26 peoples, 
practically all with a small population, inhabiting the North of 
the Russian Federation. We are gratified that, during the period 
between the most recent censuses, the size of the population in 
the small-population peoples of the North on the territory of 
our republic increased by 6372, or by 34.5 percent. During that 
same period the size of the Sakha nation increased by 16.3 
percent, and the size of the rural -- mainly indigenous -- 
population increased by 9.8 percent. I might note that the rates 
of population increase among the small-population peoples of the 
North in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) are considerably higher 
than the same indicators on the whole for the Russian 
Federation. There the total increase for all 25 ethnic groups 
was 16.6 percent. Thanks to the higher rates of population 
increase, the percentage of the small-population peoples of the 
North in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) increased from 11.8 to 
13.7 in the total figure of Russia's indigenous North. 
  The highest birth rate is observed among the Eveny -- those 
rates came to 50.4 percent during the period between censuses. 
More than half the Eveny in the Russian Federation live on the 
territory of the Republic of Sakha. The number of Evenki in our 
republic increased by 24.5 percent, whereas, for Russia as a 
whole, the increase came to 10.6 percent, and in the Evenki 
Autonomous Okrug, which is in Krasnoyarsk Kray, it came to only 
7.4 percent. The percentage of Evenki in the Republic of Sakha 
in the entire Evenki population of the Russian Federation 
increased by 24.8 to 48.2 percent. The favorable conditions for 
the population increase can be explained by a number of factors. 
  First of all, we benefited from the declarations and 
promises 
to change over to practical matters. The republic's leadership, 
in defending the rights and interests of the indigenous 
population of the North, in the scientific posing and practical 
resolution of a number of problems of the socioeconomic and 
cultural development of the small-population peoples of the 
North, has been recognized in all the regions of the Russian 
North. Something that serves as the best confirmation of the 
correctness of the course that was chosen by us is the increase 
in the migration in the Republic of Sakha of representatives of 
the indigenous population of the North from adjacent krays and 
oblasts. For the time being, the only nationality that does not 
live in our republic is the Nganasany. 
  It is difficult to cure a sick person if he himself does not 
really want to be cured. In the same way, it is important in the 
rebirth of the northern peoples to reinforce their will to live 
and their confidence in their own abilities, and to develop 
national self-awareness. Any nation is reborn through the 
development of language and the resuscitation of cultural and 
spiritual life. 
  Look at the results of the 1989 population census and you 
will easily be convinced that a large number of people in 
various ethnic groups have lost the knowledge of their native 
language --Orochony, Chvantsy, Itelmeny, Nivkhi, Udegeytsy, 
Evenki, Yukagiry, and Mansi. 
  One could hardly expect any other result: the way of life 
has 
changed so, and there has been such a narrowing of the sphere of 
use of the native language. Unfortunately, it is precisely the 
native language of the peoples in the North that used to be 
viewed most frequently as a subject of secondary importance in 
primary school and as a linguistic phenomenon in science. 
Currently in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia) very important laws have been enacted, that regulate 
the linguistic life of the peoples residing on the particular 
territory. Work has been broadened to restore and develop 
national systems of educating the indigenous peoples of the 
republic, including those for the Eveny, Evenki, and Yukagiry. 
The Institute of Problems of Small-Population Peoples of the 
North, of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, has submitted a concept for national Evenki, Eveny, 
and Yukagiry schools, the concept of preschool education. They 
have become components of the republic-wide concept of the 
national school. For the first time, the Nizhnekolymskiy College 
of the Peoples of the North is operating, and the School of 
Northern Philology has been created at Yakutsk State University. 
The Institute of Problems of Small-Population Peoples of the 
North has been created under the academy, and that institute, 
during just one year of its existence, in addition to conducting 
fundamental research, has developed state programs entitled "The 
Health of Small-Population Peoples of the North" and "The Press 
of Small-Population Peoples of the North." The draft of a 
Program for the Socioeconomic Development of the Eveny, Evenki, 
and Yukagiry is being prepared. The institute is also executing 
a number of state production orders for the Russian Federation 
and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) for the correct guaranteeing 
of social questions in the development of the peoples of the 
North. 
  For example, for several years there have been regular 
broadcasts by the "Gevan" ("Dawn") radio station in the Evenki, 
Eveny, and Yukagiry language. There is a special program on 
republic television, and the thick artistic magazine ROZOVAYA 
CHAYKA [Pink Seagull] is published. Supplements to it are 
published in the languages of the peoples of the North. 
  I shall particularly emphasize that all this work is being 
carried out by the forces of the republic itself and within the 
confines of the republic. Therefore at one time it was 
surprising to hear the enthusiastic report that Moscow had begun 
radio broadcasts in the Assyrian language for a nation that 
scarcely numbers 1000 persons. Why doesn't Moscow have radio and 
television broadcasts in the languages of the peoples of Russia, 
especially the peoples with small populations which spend most 
of their life far from populated places and for whom radio is 
practically the only thread that links a person with the outside 
world and with his state? Active, functioning language, press, 
radio and television, meaningful publishing activity, and the 
creation of literary and artistic works -- all these things and 
many more form the nation's vital spirit and make its spiritual 
life unique. Nor can we do without the national intelligentsia. 
Using as an example the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) I can state 
confidently that our land has its rightful share of talent. We 
have brilliant individuals who are capable of becoming the 
expressers of the national self-awareness of the northern 
peoples. I do not doubt that the spiritual life of northerners 
will become even more enriched with the influx of fresh forces, 
under the conditions of freedom and democracy that are new for 
us. There is no need to interfere in that natural process, or to 
unify and level the culture of peoples. The variety of cultures 
is the beauty that will save the world. 
  Something that can serve as the confirmation of what has 
been 
said is the history of the nomadic tribal commune, which was 
destroyed during the years of the Soviet authority and that is 
being restored now. In a resolution enacted by the first 
congress of tribal nomadic communes that was held in our 
republic, it is directly stated: "...The restored tribal 
communes will become a true socioeconomic and spiritual base for 
the rebirth and further prosperity of the way of life of the 
small-population peoples of the North as completely equal 
subjects of the sovereign renewed state." Prior to that, the 
Constitution of the Republic of Sakha )Yakutia) was enacted. 
Article 42 of that constitution reads: "...The republic, 
respecting the traditions, culture, and customs of the 
indigenous peoples and small-population peoples of the North, 
protects and guarantees their inalienable right: 
  "-- to own and use, in conformity with the law, the land and 
resources, including the tribal agricultural, hunting, and 
fishing grounds; 
  "-- to organize a social program and a medical program with 
a 
consideration of the economic peculiarities of the area being 
populated, and the management and ethnic specifics of the human 
organism; 
  "-- to protect against any form of coercive assimilation and 
ethnocide, as well as encroachments on ethnic uniqueness, the 
historic holy places, or monuments of spiritual and material 
culture." 
  I might note that the demand stated in the Constitution is 
being translated into the language of practical life. Several 
laws have been enacted and are in operation: "The Nomadic Tribal 
Commune of the Small-Population Peoples of the North," 
"Citizenship," "Languages in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)"; 
and "The Alternative Military Service of Representatives of 
Small-Population Peoples of the North." According to those 
documents, the languages spoken by the peoples of the North have 
been recognized as official in places of dense population. 
  In our opinion, the question of the self-government of the 
nomadic tribal commune as a form of national-territorial 
formation of the small-population nation that does not have its 
own state system deserves the most careful and complete study. 
It is also necessary for us to analyze the rich experience of 
the indigenous nations of the North beyond the border. 
  The further work of creating legislation dealing with the 
problems of the small-population peoples in the North of the 
Russian Federation must be aimed at developing, for example, 
legislative drafts and legal-normative acts dealing with: legal 
status; local self-government; the traditional trades engaged in 
by these peoples; benefits; the training of cadres of 
specialists; the northern domesticated reindeer; and the 
construction of housing and social and cultural amenities in 
places of dense population by those peoples. 
  The reform of the self-government of the peoples in the 
North 
of the Russian Federation presupposes a change in the strategy 
of state policy with respect to the northern territories. The 
territory of the Russian Federation remains the cradle of the 
unique culture of the peoples of the North. The government of 
the Russian Federation, like the governments of the Republic of 
Sakha (Yakutia) and the other subjects of the Federation, is 
responsible for preserving and developing those peoples. 
  There is nothing surprising in the fact that the Republic of 
Sakha (Yakutia) has proven to be on the cutting edge of the 
problems pertaining to the life of the northern peoples. It is 
herein that the republic views the priorities of its policy and 
develops the strategy and tactics for its development. What is 
much more surprising is the shortsightedness of certain 
influential politicians who do not see the vital importance of 
the northern problems and postpone indefinitely the resolution 
of those problems. The republic will patiently explain its views 
and its policy with respect to the future of the entire North 
and the Arctic zone for Russia and for mankind as a whole. 
Practical steps have already been taken in the direction of 
reinforcing the cooperation among the northern states. We shall 
develop as a northern state and as such shall cooperate with the 
world community and bear responsibility to that community for 
keeping intact the achievements of circumpolar civilization and 
for the rebirth of the northern peoples. Today the Republic of 
Sakha is becoming a completely equal member of the community of 
northern states -- the Northern Forum -- and feels completely 
confident in its new role. This kind of "northern" 
specialization of international cooperation under the conditions 
of the political thaw must yield weighty and tangible fruits 
both for the participants and for the rest of mankind. The Cold 
War is not for northerners -- it's already cold here. Warfare is 
definitely not a northern pastime. 
  The time has come for the joint development and enactment of 
an international law governing northern space -- a law governing 
the Arctic. It would make it possible to lay the legal basis for 
the efficient use of the resources of the North and to establish 
international monitoring of their use. 
  It is also necessary to strive constantly to improve the 
legal acts dealing with the protection of the northern ethnic 
groups, their traditional way of life, and modern forms of 
management, spiritual self-expression, and self-government. It 
is necessary to recognize the fact that the inhabitants of the 
North are now a new population of people who have become firmly 
established in their life in the higher latitudes. Irrespective 
of nationality, they must possess the corresponding set of 
rights and obligations that guarantee the conditions for 
prosperity in the North. The vital activity and the standards 
for guaranteeing it and providing services for people must have 
a zonal peculiarity. It is also necessary to proceed from the 
specific requirements of the natural and geographical 
environment in which people live. 
  Justice requires the consolidation of the efforts of the 
world community in supporting circumpolar civilization. The 
humanization of international relations will promote the 
conception and development of a new policy in the area of the 
Arctic Circle.

<F P=106> [Report by V. Maltseva under the rubric "Press Conference": </F>
"Siberian Agreement: Concept of the Region's Development"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Ivankov, general director of the 
Siberian Agreement interregional association's executive board, 
held a press conference on the results of the association 
council meeting that took place in Moscow. 
  This was not the first time Moscow was selected as the place 
for a "large gathering" for reasons of convenience: This time 
heads of oblast administrations--association members--came to 
the capital for an expanded session of the government. It is 
also important that, as a rule, high-ranking statesmen take part 
in Moscow conferences of Siberian Agreement: On 4 March it was 
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. In his address he spoke 
against raising electric and transportation rates, which was 
supported by Siberians. The deputy prime minister detailed his 
trip to Norway, where he was familiarized with the practical 
side of taxation. The tax policy of our northern neighbors is 
aimed at supporting their own producers, and this, of course, is 
the main lesson for our legislators, through whose efforts 
domestic industry continues to remain in a difficult situation. 
  Representatives of Siberian territories who spoke at the 
council asked the government rather pointed questions. Their 
meaning was that along with delegating to Siberian regions 
responsibility for conducting reform, rights should be delegated 
that would make it possible to proceed more effectively with 
this process. So far there is not even a government concept of 
economic reform in the Siberian region. Speaking of the 
interdependence between the European part of Russia and its 
eastern territories, in this respect the scales are revealingly 
tilted. Siberia needs only one-tenth of the electric power 
produced here, one-hundredth of the aluminum, and does not need 
as much oil, gas, and coal... But if Siberia works for Russia as 
a whole, there should be a corresponding attitude toward it. So 
far, however, no such line is seen in economic policy. 
  An example is the allocation of credit to back up 
agricultural campaigns. Novosibirsk Oblast currently can cover 
only one-third of its countryside's needs for fuel and 
lubricants. Keeping in mind that only one-third of the needed 
fallow land area has been plowed, one may assume that spring 
plowing will "eat up" the fuel quite fast. The outcome is well 
known: You reap what you sow. It appears that it will again be 
cheaper to buy Canadian grain than to grow our own... 
  A score of current problems were discussed at the Siberian 
Agreement council, regarding which decisions were made, 
agreements signed, and so on. 
  One of the main items was the document "On the Socioeconomic 
Development of Siberian Regions and the Course of Economic 
Reforms," which was adopted after the discussion following the 
report by the association council chairman, V. Zubov, "Siberia 
and Economic Reform: Concept of a Development Strategy." 
  This decision states the need to prepare documents 
corresponding to the strategic goals of Siberia's development. 
The first line in this list is "On Principles of Siberian 
Regional Policy." 
  Although it was said both at the meeting and in the back 
rooms and at the press conference that Moscow cannot survive 
without Siberia, Siberian Agreement intends through its 
activities to prove not so much this idea as a more fruitful 
one--that of restoring the eastern territories through joint 
efforts, protecting them from demographic expansion on the part 
of contiguous states. This danger is quite real: Siberians are 
dying out or moving away, and population centers are being 
filled with new residents; in some places, for instance, there 
are twice as many Chinese as there are Russians.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Tordes: "Siberia Demands an Increase in </F>
Export Quotas: and the Far East Military-Industrial Complex 
Demands a Supplemental Feeding From Moscow"] 
  [Text] It is not just in the capital that passions over the 
budget are heating up: Demands by members of the Council of 
Ministers from the army, agriculture and the military-industrial 
complex are being backed up by the voices of their subordinates 
from remote Russian regions. 
  On behalf of the defense industry in the Far East (which 
remains the patrimony of the military-industrial complex), a 
"conference of commodity producers" that convened in Khabarovsk 
has already expressed its views perfectly clearly. The directors 
who gathered there stated that in the pst two years their 
production volume has amounted to nearly 30 percent, and more 
than 122,000 specialists have left the region than have come 
there during the same period. 
  The major council of the Siberian Agreement Association that 
met yesterday identified a similar situation in Siberia. 
However, Siberia's raw material producers may count not only on 
Moscow but also on themselves. The main proposals to the 
government from the governors of the krays and oblasts across 
the Urals have to do with a very sizeable expansion of the 
territories' export rights. The Siberians believe that the 
"institution of special exporters" ought to be abolished as a 
concept, granting everyone equal rights to engage in foreign 
economic activity. At the same time, export quotas should be 
increased to 20 percent of the output produced in the region--by 
decision of local authorities, without getting the Center's 
consent. 
  In the opinion of Siberian Agreement, the share of collected 
customs duties and export taxes that is left in the region 
should be raised to at least 30 percent. However, the export 
duties themselves, the Siberians insist, should be reduced, and 
import duties for medicines, food and equipment should be 
abolished entirely. 
  Aleksey Gumilevskiy, director of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relation's Main Administration for 
Coordinating the Foreign Economic Activities of the Components 
of the Federation, told ITAR-TASS that "such favorable treatment 
cannot be granted to any one territory taken by itself," and 
that "a number of the problems mentioned would be eliminated if 
there were a gradual transition from nontariff methods of 
regulating foreign economic activity to purely tariff-based 
methods of regulation." However, it does not look as though 
Siberia will agree to wait until that finally happens. Valeriy 
Zubov, governor of Krasnoyarsk Kray, has repeatedly stated that 
the use of regional export revenues may become the only 
alternative to federal budget subsidies to money-losing 
enterprises. 
  As for the military-industrial complex's directors 
themselves--the "commodity producers" (although the word 
"commodity," i.e., what is bought and sold, is somewhat strained 
when applied to their products)--they continue to count on being 
bailed out by one form of support or another. Despite the 
industry's crisis, fewer than 4 percent of the enterprise's in 
Khabarovsk Kray have been shut down, and just a little more than 
another 7 percent have gone to a reduced work week. Employment 
is being artificially maintained: with official unemployment of 
6,500 persons, hidden unemployment exceeds 50,000. 
  In the meantime, in neighboring Maritime Kray the defense 
industry has already wangled money from the government to pay 
the power engineers. What's sensational about the situation is 
that the power engineers' debts were not paid anyway, and the 
emergency economic situation in the kray has been extended until 
7 March. According to some information, the directors of the 
defense industries preferred to put the money into circulation 
and put off repayment of the debts "until later."

(not including

<H5>  FINANCE </H5>
  Over the January-November period, R197.7 billion [rubles] 
was 
received in profit, including R65.4 billion (33.1 percent) in 
the nonstate sector. More than 75 percent of all profit is 
attributable to industry. 
  Profits increased 8.0-fold as compared with January-November 
1992, including a 7.5-fold increase in industry. The entirety of 
the increase seen in profits was due to increased prices. 
  At the same time, the financial state of enterprises 
continues to be adverse. The profitability factor with respect 
to industrial production was on the level of 41-44 percent. 
However, the increased prices are noticeably depreciating the 
income received by enterprises. Over 16 percent of all 
enterprises and organizations of the oblast were operating 
unprofitably in January-November. In industry and 
transportation, 14 percent of enterprises operated at a loss; in 
housing and municipal facilities--12 percent; in trade--over 20 
percent; and in provision of everyday services--40 percent. On 
the whole, the number of enterprises operating at a loss 
decreased by 7 percent as compared with January-November 1992, 
but their number in industry rose 17 percent. 
  On the whole in the state sector of the oblast economy, the 
proportion of unprofitable enterprises was 3.8 percentage points 
higher than was the case in the nonstate sector. 
  Insolvency of enterprises is significantly aggravating the 
problem of unprofitability. As of 1 December 1993, the total 
amount of creditor indebtedness of enterprises in industry, 
construction, transportation, and agriculture came to R145.6 
billion, of which R40 billion, or 27 percent, was overdue. 
Residual free monetary assets totaling R19.4 billion as of 1 
December covered one-seventh (13.3 percent) of their total 
creditor indebtedness. Debts receivable for the above-mentioned 
sectors amounted to R185.2 billion, 27.2 percent higher than the 
enterprise debt. 
  Low solvency (the ratio of monetary assets and debts 
receivable to creditor indebtedness and debts on credits and 
loans secured) was observed at enterprises of the coal industry 
(12.7 percent), the machinebuilding and metalworking industry 
(68.2 percent), the lumber and woodworking industry (64.7 
percent), the textile industry (55.4 percent), the garment 
industry (69.5 percent), the food industry (54.3 percent), and 
at agricultural enterprises (48.3 percent). 
  The indebtedness of industrial, construction, 
transportation, 
and agricultural enterprises with respect to bank credits as of 
1 December exceeded their own monetary assets fourfold. 
  Delinquent indebtedness with respect to issuance of 
consumption funds in the sectors of industry, construction, and 
agriculture amounted to R3.8 billion as of 1 January 1994. The 
amount of unpaid wages in industry decreased by 23 percent in 
December 1993 as compared with November, amounting to R1.7 
billion; in construction this figure dropped to half its 
November level, coming to R0.7 billion; in agriculture, the 
figure decreased by 13 percent, amounting to R1.3 billion. 
  Poor payments discipline at enterprises is complicating the 
generation of financial resources necessary for production and 
social development. 
  The largest share of assets expended consisted of payments 
to 
the budget--55 percent (31 percent for 1992). 
  Some R215.6 billion in taxes and other payments were made to 
the state budget from enterprises, organizations, and the 
populace of the oblast in 1993. This is seven times the amount 
paid in 1992. About half this figure (48.7 percent) came from 
tax on profits. Value-added tax accounted for 24.6 percent, and 
taxes from the populace--11.5 percent. 
<H5>  PRIVATIZATION </H5>
  As of 1 January 1994, 1,375 enterprises in the oblast had 
been privatized. Of these, 439, or 32 percent, were privatized 
in 1993. Of the total number of privatized enterprises, 20 
percent became private property through conversion to 
joint-stock operation (full or partial), 80 percent--through 
sale. 
  The proportion of large-scale federally owned enterprises 
privatized increased from 5 percent in 1992 to 11 percent in 
1993, while the proportion originally constituting oblast and 
municipal property decreased somewhat--from 18 to 14 percent and 
from 76 to 75 percent, respectively. 
  The main avenues for sale of property of enterprises during 
the process of "small" privatization were: buy-up of leased 
property (21 percent of the total number of enterprises 
privatized); sale through commercial competition (35 percent); 
auctions (23 percent). Sale of the property of liquidated 
enterprises was chosen by only 1 percent of enterprises. 
  The proportion of enterprises privatized through conversion 
to joint-stock operation rose 4 percentage points over 1992. Of 
three alternatives of benefits offered labor collectives when 
converting to joint-stock operation, the second alternative was 
preferred, allowing the labor collective to hold a controlling 
package of shares. More than three-fourths of the enterprises 
converting to joint-stock operation selected this benefits 
option. One-fifth of such enterprises chose the first 
alternative. In addition, 2 percent of enterprises converted to 
joint-stock operation through transformation of leased 
enterprises. 
  The total value of property of enterprises privatized (prior 
to reevaluation of fixed capital) amounted to R27.5412 billion. 
The average value of an enterprise privatized from municipal 
ownership was R2.7 million, from oblast ownership--R39.6 
million, and from federal ownership--R88.4 million. 
  Competitive demand for property privatized is determined 
both 
by sector affiliation and type of ownership. On the whole, the 
difference between the sale price and initially declared value 
of the property, i.e., the average value rate of enterprises 
privatized, is 12-fold, including 24-fold for enterprises of 
municipal ownership, and threefold for enterprises of oblast and 
federal ownership. 
  Total proceeds from the sale of property to new owners 
(including funds from enterprises privatized in 1992) amounted 
to R5.7 billion in monetary assets and 526,300 privatization 
checks. 
  Over 60 percent of the funds received from privatization of 
enterprise property was deposited as revenue into oblast, rayon, 
and city budgets; 16 percent went to the federal budget, and 22 
percent was directed to state privatization organs. 
  As of 1 January 1994, 82,300 apartments were privatized in 
the oblast (30.6 percent of the total number), including 35,700 
in 1993. Of the total number of apartments privatized, 99 
percent were privatized at no cost. 
  Funds totaling R59.6 million were received from the 
privatization of housing, R37.4 of which (63 percent) was 
received in 1993. 
  The average value of a privatized apartment was R11,000. The 
average size--50 square meters. 
<H5>  PRICE AND RATE LEVELS AND INDICES </H5>
  The fairly high level of inflation was maintained in 1993. 
It 
was spasmodic, however. 
  Consumer prices for basic products and services increased 
8.1-fold by December 1992. The maximum level of inflation was 
set at the beginning of the year, when consumer goods and 
services had almost doubled in price toward the end of the first 
quarter, as compared with December of the previous year. A trend 
toward reduced rates of inflation was seen beginning mid-year: 
1.7-fold during the second quarter, 1.8-fold during the third 
quarter, and 1.4-fold during the fourth quarter. 
  However, the growth of consumer prices of goods and services 
in 1993 was significantly lower than in 1992, when a 24.9-fold 
increase was seen. 
  Thus, prices for food products in 1993 increased 8.7-fold, 
nonfood products--6.7-fold. These figures for 1992 were 
13.1-fold and 19.8-fold, respectively. In this regard, during 
the first half-year of 1993, food product prices rose at a 
galloping rate, while this was the case for nonfood products in 
the third quarter. Then in the fourth quarter an alternation was 
seen: in October in favor of food products, in November nonfood 
products, and in December the rate increases were the same. 
  Changes in the prices of individual food products were also 
diverse. Compared with December 1992 prices, meat dumplings 
increased in price 29-fold; vegetables--18-fold; cottage cheese 
and sausage products, meat and meat products, milk and dairy 
products--from 11-to 14-fold; butter, cheeses, eggs, bread, and 
bakery products--from seven- to 10-fold. Fluctuations in the 
rates of price change for industrial commodities were also 
observed. 
  Prices increased significantly over the year for medicines 
(102-fold), operating stock (27-fold), office products, building 
materials, fuel, and individual commodities for children and 
adults (from 10- to 14-fold). 
  A more significant rise in prices was observed with respect 
to paid services provided the populace. This change overall 
amounted to a 14.8-fold increase for the year (48.2-fold for 
1992). This is 2.2 times greater than the growth of prices of 
nonfood products, and 1.7 times greater than that for food 
products. 
  In 1993, the stipulated rates for certain notary services 
increased by a factor of 1,462, for legal consultation--by a 
factor of 61. Passes for rest and relaxation facilities 
increased 44-fold, tickets for the theater and museums and the 
initial visit to the doctor--more than 30-fold. Certain cosmetic 
and medical services, parental fees for child care, lodging in 
hotels and dormitories, photography, laundry, dry cleaning, and 
barber services, repair of footwear, refrigerators, and 
televisions, rates for electric power and intercity 
communications, postal rates, subscriber fees for home telephone 
use and cable radio--all increased in price by factors of six to 
20. 
  Wholesale prices of enterprises for industrial production in 
1993 increased 9.6-fold as compared with December 1992. 
  The rise in wholesale prices was most significant in the 
meat 
and chemical industry, electric power industry, and building 
materials industry (13- to 14-fold), and in the milk industry 
(10-fold). Nitrogen fertilizers, water-heating boiler 
facilities, footwear, meat products, and glass kitchenware 
increased from 11- to 14-fold in cost, and crushed stone--more 
than 19-fold. 
  The purchase price index for grain in 1993 was 578 percent, 
for potatoes--330 percent, vegetables--1,545 percent. The 
purchase price of livestock and fowl increased 13.4-fold over 
the year, milk--10.3-fold, and eggs--9.5-fold. 
<H5>  THE SOCIAL SPHERE </H5>
  The demographic situation. As of 1 January 1994, 
the population was 1,167,000, according to estimated data. 
  In 1993, 9,600 infants were born in the oblast. This is 
1,200 
(11 percent) fewer than in 1992; 19,200 people died--2,900 (17.6 
percent) more than in 1992. 
  The level of natural population loss was 1.7 times greater 
than that of 1992, and amounted to 9,600 people. This was 
observed everywhere except in the city of Desnogorsk. The city 
population of the oblast diminished by 4,700 people as a result 
of natural processes, the rural population--by 4,900. 
  Heart disease and malignant tumors remain the most 
frequently 
encountered illnesses, constituting the cause of 72 percent of 
deaths. 
  Some 8,408 marriages were registered in the oblast in 1993, 
or 3.7 percent more than in 1992. The number of divorces 
increased 2.5 percent, amounting to 5,534. There are 63 divorces 
for every 100 registered marriages. 
  The volume of migration (arrivals and departures) dropped 13 
percent as compared with 1992, amounting to 66,800. The number 
of arrivals exceeded the number of departures by more than 
10,000 individuals. New arrivals in the oblast included 4,374 
refugees and people forced to resettle. Among those leaving the 
oblast, 208 departed for permanent residence in countries of the 
far abroad. 
  Labor resources. The number of persons employed in 
the oblast economy (not including cooperatives, small or private 
enterprises) during 1993 was 451,000. This is 2.7 percent fewer 
than in 1992. 
  Some 18,100 citizens seeking jobs filed application with the 
state employment service in 1993. The intermediary efforts of 
this service resulted in job placement for 9,200 individuals, or 
51 percent of the applicants. 
  As of the beginning of January of this year, 2,800 citizens 
out of work were registered with the employment service organs. 
This number decreased 24 percent over the year. Some 1,100 
individuals were declared unemployed. Some 44 percent of the 
unemployed were persons laid off in connection with the 
elimination or reorganization of enterprises and with personnel 
cuts. More than 56,000 people (12.4 percent of those employed in 
the oblast economy) took additional leave or were shifted to 
employment based on less than a full work week at the initiative 
of the administration, i.e., constitute the potentially 
unemployed. For every 10 vacancies indicated by enterprises, 
there are 13 individuals seeking employment. In this regard, it 
is blue-collar workers that enterprises require most of all (73 
percent of the employment requirement). 
  Some 362 persons (3.7 times greater than at the beginning of 
1993) underwent occupational training at the direction of the 
employment service. 
  Monetary income of the populace in 1993, according 
to preliminary estimates, totaled over R406 billion, a 9.7-fold 
increase over 1992. Growth of income of the populace last year 
surpassed the growth of consumer prices during all months except 
January, May, and July. 
  Income of the populace increased 10 percent over the year in 
real terms. 
  Growth of income in December is explained through the 
regular 
increase in the minimum wage and corresponding increase in 
salaries in the budget sphere. Also influencing the growth in 
incomes were material-assistance payments at the end of the year 
and awards for annual work results. 
  In the final months of 1993, the proportion of outlays for 
purchase of goods and services decreased, while the proportion 
of savings in deposits and securities increased. Significant 
amounts of ready cash stayed in the possession of the populace. 
Thus, in December 1993, the share of total income kept on hand 
by the populace came to 31.4 percent (in November this was 26.8 
percent, in October--24.8 percent). 
  Average per capita face-value monetary income over 1993 
amounted to 197 percent of the subsistence minimum (157 percent 
in 1992). At the same time, almost one-fifth of the population 
had an average per capita monetary income lower than the 
subsistence minimum during the course of 1993. 
  The average monthly wages of workers at enterprises and 
organizations (not including cooperatives, small or private 
enterprises) for 1993 came to R43,800--9.7 times greater than in 
1992 (first quarter--R14,300, second quarter--R30,500, third 
quarter--R51,500, fourth quarter--R78,800). 
  The average wage in December 1993 was R96,300--35 percent 
greater than in November 1993. 
  In this regard, the average wage in the material production 
sectors exceeded R96,100. In the nonproduction sphere it was 
R97,000, and not including credit and insurance 
organizations--R77,000. 
  Consumer market of goods and services. Toward the 
end of 1993, the decline in production of consumer goods had 
decelerated. The industry of the oblast produced consumer goods 
during the year totaling R429.5 billion, or 12.6 percent less 
than in 1992 (for the first quarter the reduction was 26.4 
percent, for the first half year--14.2 percent). 
  The output of nonfood products decreased to the greatest 
extent (by 14.4 percent). This was affected by the sharp 
reduction in output of light industry products (by 20.4 percent). 
  The production decrease was 48 percent for cotton fabrics, 
34 
percent for knitted articles, and 14 percent for leather shoes. 
  The output of food products decreased by 4.7 percent. Some 
5,300 tonnes (14 percent) less meat (industrial output) was 
produced than in 1992, sausage products--1,200 tonnes less (7 
percent), whole milk products--8,200 tonnes less (13 percent), 
bread and bakery products--44,300 tonnes less (21 percent), and 
confectionery items--1,100 tonnes less (9 percent). 
  The production volume of dishware and crockery, sewing 
machines, electric irons, umbrellas, tape recorders, and 
greenhouses was higher than in 1992. 
  Over the past year, the retail trade volume of officially 
registered trade enterprises and public kitchens of all forms of 
ownership amounted to R245.2 billion. Expenditures by the 
populace on the purchase of commodities increased 9.8-fold in 
actual prices as compared with 1992. Trade turnover in physical 
terms decreased by 9.7 percent. Almost half the trade turnover 
volume (48 percent) was attributable to privately owned 
enterprises. With respect to food products on the consumer 
market, an adverse situation has developed concerning provision 
of potatoes and vegetables to the populace. 
  As far as nonfood products are concerned, sales of 
televisions and synthetic detergents rose significantly 
(1.4-fold). It was precisely with respect to these goods, 
however, that interruptions in trade were observed. 
  Paid services totaling R18.1 billion were provided residents 
of the oblast over 1993. In current prices, the provision of 
paid services increased 9.2-fold as compared with 1992, while in 
physical terms 39 percent less in services was rendered to the 
populace. 
  The volume of provision of everyday services decreased 36 
percent in comparable price terms over the 1992 level. Over half 
the volume of everyday services were provided by officially 
registered enterprises of the nonstate sector. Provision of 
everyday services to the rural population deteriorated. 
According to the results of a one-time survey of the network of 
rural enterprises providing everyday services to the populace, 
16 rural rayons lack a permanent network of consumer services, 
and an equal number do not have the itinerant variety of service 
provision. 
  Education. As of the start of the 1993/1994 school 
year, there were 696 general-education schools operating during 
the daytime and 14 evening-session schools. Additionally, there 
were two nonstate schools--a private high school and orthodox 
secondary school. 
  Pupils number over 153,000--1,719 (4 percent) more than was 
the case the previous school year. 
  There continues to be an increase in the number of schools 
operating in two or three sessions. Whereas for the 1992/1993 
school year, 17 percent of schools were in this category, the 
proportion was 20 percent in 1993/1994. The percentage of pupils 
attending second session increased from 23 to 25 percent, third 
session--from 0.7 to 0.8 percent. 
  Some 12,300 students receive instruction in five institutes 
of higher education of the oblast. This number includes 9,800 
students in daytime instruction. As compared with the 1992/1993 
school year, the number of students has decreased by 679 (5 
percent). Some 2,435 individuals obtained higher education in 
1993. Only 49 percent of the graduates received employment 
assignments. The remainder were afforded the right to seek job 
placement independently. 
  In 27 special secondary and higher educational institutions, 
17,200 students are receiving instruction. This includes 7,900 
students (46 percent) at nine colleges. The number of students 
decreased a negligible amount--by 400 (2 percent)--as compared 
with the (1992-1993 school year. In 1993, 4,413 specialists were 
trained with special secondary and higher education. Fewer than 
one-third of the graduates (26 percent) received an employment 
assignment. 
  Crime. Some 22,700 crimes were registered in the 
oblast in 1993, 10 percent more than in 1992 (in 1992 the 
increase was 30 percent). Over half the crimes (58 percent) were 
solved. 
  The proportion of grave crimes committed during the year 
increased by 3 percent, amounting to 13.6 percent. 
  The proportion of property crimes continues to rise. Theft 
constituted almost 60 percent of all the crimes committed. 
<H5>  MATERIAL PRODUCTION </H5>
  Industry. Industrial production in the oblast in 
1993 was marked by instability. A trend toward deceleration of 
the decline in production was noted in the final months, 
however. Whereas the ratio of production volume for the first 
quarter of 1993 to that for the same period of 1992 was just 
79.4 percent, the volume of industrial production on the whole 
as compared to the 1992 level was 88.3 percent. Deceleration of 
the decline in industrial production was affected by a growth in 
production output achieved by enterprises of the 
energy-producing machine building industry (137.6 percent), 
garment industry (112.7 percent), butter and cheese processing 
and dairy industry (115.5 percent), and printing industry (103.7 
percent). The most significant lag behind 1992 levels was 
observed in the tractor and agricultural machine-building 
industry (37.6 percent of the 1992 level), in instrument 
manufacture (75.1 percent), the fuel industry (78.4 percent), 
and the textile industry (73.1 percent). 
  A drop was noted in the production of electric power--by 4 
percent, major electrical machinery--by 31 percent, light 
bulbs--by 13 percent, automation tools and devices and their 
spare parts--by 41 percent, computer equipment--by 39 percent, 
and mineral fertilizers--by 20 percent. 
  Production of commercial timber fell by 31 percent. Due to 
the lack of raw timber, output of sawn lumber was reduced 17 
percent. 
  Enterprises of the construction industry curtailed their 
output of building bricks by 7 percent, prefabricated reinforced 
concrete components--by 20 percent, soft roofing materials--by 
39 percent, enameled ceramic tile--by 16 percent. 
  At the same time that production volume in industry 
diminished, a reduction was seen in the number of employees. 
This reduction in personnel is proceeding less intensively, 
however. In 1993 the number of employees decreased by just 5.1 
percent. As a result, the drop in labor productivity was more 
significant--6.9 percent. One reason for this situation is the 
fact that the number of qualified workers has been retained in 
hopes that production will improve. 
  There are 10 enterprises in the oblast engaged in 
conversion. 
In 1993 the total volume of production at these enterprises 
decreased 17 percent from the 1992 level, including a 47 percent 
decrease in military production. The proportion of the total 
output of these enterprises attributable to civilian production 
was 56.8 percent, as opposed to 63 percent in 1992. 
  Agriculture. With respect to agriculture, 1993 saw 
a continuation of the redistribution of lands, their 
privatization, and the reorganization of kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes. As a result, at the end of the year the oblast had 
312 partnerships and joint-stock companies of the closed 
variety, 60 collective farms, 31 agricultural cooperatives, 31 
sovkhozes, 21 kolkhozes, and two associations of peasant 
(owner-operated) farms. As of 1 January 1994, there were 3,183 
peasant (owner-operated) farms, with 165,800 hectares of land at 
their disposal. 
  Some 633 peasant (owner-operated) farms were newly 
established during the year (1,947 in 1992), while more than 300 
farms ceased their operation. 
  The gross production output of farms of every category in 
1993 amounted to R936.2 million (in 1983 comparable prices). 
This is R82.3 million (8 percent) less than in 1992. 
  More than half (52 percent) the volume of gross agricultural 
output was obtained from farms of the populace and peasant 
(owner-operated) farms. Their share amounted to 42 percent in 
1992. For all categories of farms, planted crop production 
output was significantly less than in 1992, as a result of 
reduced areas under seed and diminished crop productivity. Grain 
output totaled 726,200 tonnes (weight after additional 
processing)--88,800 tonnes (11 percent) less than in 1992; 
vegetable production totaled 106,200 tonnes--45,500 tonnes (30 
percent) less; and flax fiber output was 6,800 tonnes--11,700 
tonnes (65 percent) less. Production of potatoes increased by 8 
percent, amounting to 719,500 tonnes. 
  For the 1994 harvest, agricultural enterprises almost cut in 
half their sowing of winter crops and plowing of land for spring 
planting. 
  The situation with respect to livestock is ambiguous. In 
1993, a 2 percent growth was achieved in livestock production 
output for all categories of farms by increasing production in 
owner-operated farms and farms of the populace. 
  Agricultural enterprises reduced their production of meat in 
1993 by 7 percent from 1992 levels, eggs--by 4 percent, wool--by 
45 percent. Production of milk increased by 7 percent due to 
increased productivity of the cows, amounting to 412,800 tonnes. 
The average amount of milk yield per cow for the year was 2,008 
kilograms (1,677 kilograms in 1992). The trend toward reduced 
herd size is continuing. As of 1 January 1994, the number of 
cattle at all varieties of farms decreased by 8 percent, 
amounting to 618,300 head. The number of cows was reduced by 1 
percent, amounting to 276,300 head. The number of pigs came to 
318,800, 0.7 percent less; the number of sheep and 
goats--133,000, 6 percent less. 
  Increased numbers of livestock on farms of the populace and 
owner-operated farms did not compensate for their drop at 
agricultural enterprises. 
  Agricultural enterprises went into the winter season with 
reduced feed supplies. 
  In 1993, 57,600 tonnes of mineral fertilizers (converted to 
100-percent effective nutrient substance) were delivered to meet 
the agriculture needs of the oblast, 20 percent less than the 
quantity requested. 
  As compared with 1992, agricultural enterprises obtained 73 
percent fewer trucks last year, 67 percent fewer tractor 
trailers, 69 percent fewer bulldozers, and 6 percent fewer 
tractors. Sixty-six more combines were purchased, and 44 percent 
more earth movers. 
  Capital construction. Facilities and capacities 
were put into operation last year in the oblast at the Yartsevo 
diesel engine plants, at Dvigatel (in Yartsevo), at the Smolensk 
printing combine, Roslavl chemical plant, and Smolensk city 
dairy. 
  Hard-paved roads were constructed over 402.6 kilometers, 
including 285.6 kilometers of intra-farm road. This is 34 and 51 
percent less than in 1992. 
  Livestock breeding premises were put into operation in the 
oblast to accommodate 4,100 cattle and 660 pigs; storage 
facilities for grain and seed storage--for 14,600 tonnes; and 
vegetable and potato storage facilities--for 1,200 tonnes of 
simultaneous storage. 
  The volume of capital investments from all sources of 
financing in 1993 was reduced by 32 percent, amounting to R118.8 
billion. This is the consequence of decreased investment 
activity on the part of enterprises over the past two years. The 
rate of decline of capital investment volume was significantly 
higher in agriculture (53 percent) than in other sectors. 
  The proportion of centralized capital investments dropped 
from 58 percent in 1992 to 36 percent in 1993. The remainder of 
capital investments are covered by funds of enterprises (51 
percent), preferential term credits (4 percent), and investment 
funds (9 percent). Some 59 percent of the centralized funds are 
attributable to republic budget funds. 
  Construction work is being accomplished by contractor 
organizations of various forms of ownership. State contractor 
organizations account for 23 percent of the cost of the work. 
The rest is accomplished by privately owned (21 percent) and 
mixed (56 percent) organizations. 
  Some 63 percent of capital investments were used in the 
construction of production facilities, 33 percent lower than the 
prior year level. 
  Capital investments in the nonproduction sphere were reduced 
by 2 percent, amounting to R43.9 billion. Of the total volume of 
capital investments, the share of funds used for housing and 
sociocultural construction increased from 35 percent in 1992 to 
37 percent in 1993. 
  Some 4,780 apartments with all the modern conveniences were 
commissioned out of all sources of financing, including 
individual housing construction. These covered an area of 
288,700 square meters--56,200 square meters (16 percent) less 
than in 1992. At the same time, the volume of housing put into 
operation from funds of the populace increased (by 26 percent), 
although the share of total housing introduced in the oblast 
attributable to such funds is still quite low (4.9 percent). 
  Transportation and communications. Some 16.3 
million tonnes of diverse freight was shipped in 1993 by 
general-use transportation of all varieties--9.7 million tonnes 
(37 percent) less than in 1992. 
  Shipments of freight by motor vehicle transport decreased 
2.2-fold. Shipments by rail decreased by 11.8 percent. 
  Virtually the entire volume (about 97 percent) of freight 
shipments by motor vehicle transport was accomplished by 
privatized enterprises. 
  Passenger traffic volume in general-use transportation 
totaled 6 billion passenger-kilometers, a decrease of 2.2 
percent. This includes motor vehicle transport--decreasing by 
16.7 percent--and railroad transportation--increasing by 1.2 
percent. 
  Over 1993, 19.8 million (6.2 percent) fewer passengers were 
conveyed by all types of transportation than was the case a year 
ago, including a drop of 2.6 percent in railroad transportation 
and 14.2 percent in motor vehicle transport. 
  The plan for number of trips completed by intracity bus 
service was implemented only to the level of 79.5 percent as of 
1 January 1994. This is 8 percent lower than for 1992. 
  Income from basic activity of communications enterprises 
totaled R9.1 billion in 1993, including R1.7 billion from 
services rendered to the populace. This represents a 10.7-fold 
increase over the 1992 level. 
  The main factor accounting for the growth in income was 
increased prices and rates for services. 
<H5>  FOREIGN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY </H5>
  Fifty enterprises and organizations of the oblast shipped 
production output abroad in 1993 (including to the Baltic 
countries). The volume of exports came to R164.6 billion in 
domestic prices, and $171 million in foreign trade (contract) 
prices. 
  The production association Minudobreniya shipped $12.5 
million worth of fertilizers abroad (7.3 percent of the export 
volume of the oblast); the production association Kristall 
shipped precious stones valued at $150.8 million (88.2 percent). 
  Enterprises also shipped 2,600 tonnes of artificial 
graphite, 
2,100 tonnes of pelts, 460 tonnes of wood for fuel, 3,475 
refrigerators (household), 330,900 fluorescent lamps, 131,600 
square meters of facing tile, 640.7 tonnes of reinforced 
concrete items, 590,000 pair of socks, 624 tonnes of flax fiber, 
138,100 square meters of roofing material, in addition to other 
production output. Some 42 percent of all exporter enterprises 
concluded barter transactions, receiving commodities from their 
foreign partners in exchange for their output. 
  The total volume of foreign trade turnover (total of exports 
and imports) through trade exchange relationships amounted to 
$9.2 million in 1993.

<F P=106> [Article by militia Major-General V. Vorobyev, chief of the </F>
oblast UVD [Internal Affairs Administration]: "Without 
Overcoming Crime, We Will Not Achieve a Normal Life." Comments 
on summary of criminal statistics for 1993] 
  [Text] 
  [Begin boxed material] 
  The operational situation in the oblast during the past year 
was difficult. There were 22,712 crimes recorded, an increase of 
10 percent over 1992. 
  There was a characteristic increase in serious crimes. 
Moreover, not only was there an increase in their number, but 
also in their relative share within the overall structure of 
crime. This signifies an escalation of violence, cynicism and 
harshness in relations between people. During the year there 
were 182 reported cases of murder with assault. Moreover, almost 
half of them were in the sphere of family-domestic relations. 
There were 421 cases of grave bodily injury, with one in four of 
these resulting in the death of the victim, as well as 101 cases 
of rape and attempted rape. 
  [End boxed material] 
  Behind each of these criminal acts are the grief and tears 
of 
the victims, their loved ones and family members, a huge and 
often irreplaceable material loss, moral and psychological 
trauma, and broken human lives. 
  The situation is particularly alarming in the rural areas, 
where crime has increased by 10.5 percent and practically one 
out of every three crimes registered in the oblast is committed. 
The blame for this may be placed not only on the ill-planned 
migration policy, which has flooded the rural areas with 
convicted persons who have persistent negative habits and who 
are the outcasts of society, but also on the total absence of 
leisure time of the rural residents, their spiritual decline. A 
rich, full life, healthy in its constant interaction with 
nature, is often replaced by a ruinous passion for alcohol. The 
rural areas are steadily degenerating both spiritually and 
physically... 
  We may find many reasons for the avalanche-like growth of 
greedy acts, but the main one, in our opinion, consists of the 
increasing enmity between the haves and the have-nots, which is 
caused by an increase in the process of stratification of 
society by level of income and living standard. Criminal 
expropriation is rampant. But they are robbing not only the 
millionaires. Among our 10,230 fellow citizens whose property 
has been subjected to criminal encroachments, the overwhelming 
majority are ordinary workers with moderate or low income. 
Thieves have "cleaned out" 2,858 apartments, stolen 790 
automobiles and motorcycles, and performed 258 acts of stealing 
livestock from personal subsidiary farms. There have been 972 
cases of robbery and 166 cases of assault and brigandage 
committed against the personal property of citizens. 
  Taking the misfortune of others close to heart and 
understanding very well the condition of the people who have 
suffered because of criminals, I once again call upon Smolensk 
residents to show concern for the safety of their relatives and 
dear ones and the safekeeping of their personal property. We are 
ready to give aid in equipping residences with security alarms 
and to issue permits in accordance with the law for obtaining 
hunting rifles and gas-powered weapons, to help in the 
protection of enterprises, stores and offices, to train our 
four-footed friends for the security-guard service, etc. 
  Such a form of greedy-violent crime as extortion also 
requires special mention. There were 125 recorded cases of 
racketeering during the year. And, unfortunately, we are 
predicting an increase in such crimes in the future. We must say 
frankly, the detainment of extortionists presents no special 
difficulties. Many are caught red-handed and brought to criminal 
responsibility on all instances which have been reported in a 
timely manner by the victims. Nevertheless, according to the 
estimates of our experts, there are hundreds of times more cases 
of extortion than are officially reported and registered. This 
is an extremely dangerous crime, fraught with the most serious 
consequences, and the appraisal which the criminal code gives it 
is rather inadequate to the severity and social significance of 
racketeering. 
  Indulging in extortion and the obedient payment of the sums 
demanded by it will inevitably lead the bribe-payer into a maze 
of crime and will place him in jeopardy, along with the members 
of his family, his life and health, his property and well-being. 
I suggest that anyone who knows of cases of extortion and anyone 
who has become the victim of criminal terror, threats and 
violence immediately report this to the law enforcement agencies. 
  The number of encroachments on state property is continually 
growing. Underground "privatization" is going on due to the 
carelessness, connivance, and sometimes even the participation 
of economic managers and other official and materially 
responsible persons. This is inflicting a great loss upon the 
economy. Along the line of criminal investigation alone there 
have been 6,470 registered crimes against state property, 79.5 
percent of which constitute theft. The number of violant 
encroachments on our goods has increased: There have been 100 
recorded cases of robbery and 13 cases of assault and brigandage. 
  The decline in the level of morality and culture, the 
disappearance of many hindering barriers, coupled with the 
spread of alcohol, have led to a significant deterioration of 
law and order. There were 2,271 crimes committed in public 
places, an increase of 54.8 percent. Street crime has increased 
by almost 30 percent. Moreover, almost half of these crimes were 
committed in Smolensk, and one-fourth--in Promyshlennyy Rayon, 
which for a number of reasons has become the most dangerous in 
terms of crime for Smolensk residents. 
  The increase in all forms of crime has been facilitated by a 
weakening in the struggle against drunkenness. Drunks committed 
around 5,000 crimes, which is 26 percent higher than in 1992. 
And in individual rayons, as for example in Roslavlskiy, 
Khislavichskiy, Monastyrshchinskiy, Temkinskiy and Rudnyanskiy 
Rayons, the increase in "drunken" crimes has comprised more than 
80 percent. 
  Especially negative processes are taking place among the 
young people. Today few are worried that a thousand youths have 
been thrown out of schools and other educational institutions, 
deprived of the possibility of earning an honest living. Left to 
their own devices, having lost their moral guidelines and faith 
in justice, raised not on respect for the traditions of the 
older generations and all-human moral principles, but on worship 
of far from the best examples of Western life, young people 
often embark upon the path of crime. 
  Around 2,000 crimes of the racketeering type are committed 
by 
young people ranging in age from 14 to 18 years old. Among them 
there are thieves, robbers, rapists and murderers. Statistics 
show that the "army" of those who have transgressed the criminal 
law is being replentished not from the ranks of repeat 
offenders, but at the expense of young people. While recidivist 
crime has declined by 5.2 percent, crimes committed by minors 
have increased by one-fourth. 
  Especially daring crimes are often committed in groups. The 
increase in group crime comprised 24.3 percent. The participants 
in many criminal groupings are juveniles. An exceptional social 
danger is posed by the increasing tendency of adults to involve 
juveniles in criminal activity, by the division of spheres of 
influence between the groupings, and by the training of 
physically developed but morally deficient young people who are 
ready to do anything for money in semi-underground sections and 
karate, boxing and kick-boxing clubs. 
  One other very complex problem is the struggle against the 
unlawful distribution of narcotics. The desire to withdraw into 
the phantom, unreal world of dope is especially inherent to 
young people. Judging by the official data, the scope of drug 
distribution is huge. In Russia during 1993 there were 53,169 
identified cases of crimes associated with the illegal 
circulation of drugs, with one out of every 72 of these being 
discovered in our oblast. The Russian internal affairs agencies 
have seized around 20 tonnes of narcotic-containing plants from 
criminals, and here in our oblast--over 300 kilograms! Yet the 
"profession" of the drug addict is certainly not quiet: 
Considerable money is required to obtain the drugs. And this 
money is acquired through theft, robbery and hold-ups... 
  The increased boldness and violent directionality of crimes 
is expressed also in the fact that criminals are using weapons 
more often, including firearms. They are showing active 
resistance to the associates of the militia. According to the 
data of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], during the year 
associates of the Russian militia had to use weapons in 
suppressing crimes and detaining malefactors in 2,186 cases. The 
militia itself has borne tangible losses in this uncompromising 
struggle: 183 associates of law enforcement agencies were killed 
and 572 wounded in encounters with criminals. 
  There have been over 400 cases of unlawful storage and 
carrying of firearms discovered in the Smolensk region. Seized 
from the underground arsenal were 70 rifles, an anti-tank gun, 
53 sawed-off shotguns, 39 homemade firearms, 81 grenades, 8 
mines, 13 kilograms of tolite and almost 14,000 cartridges. 
There were over 800 recorded cases of resistance to associates 
of the militia, and 64 criminal cases were filed against persons 
using physical violence against the associates. The associates 
of the Smolensk militia were forced to use their weapons in over 
200 cases! 
  Last year, thanks to the intensive work of the investigative 
services, 14.6 percent more criminal cases were investigated. 
The rate of crimes solved increased by 0.7 percent and comprised 
58.1 percent (for all of Russia this figure is 50.6 percent). Of 
course, neither we, the professionals, nor the victims of the 
crimes, nor the oblast population can be satisfied by any 
positive results as long as there are 19 murderers and attempted 
murderers, 51 persons guilty of committing grave bodily 
injuries, 12 rapists, 500 robbers and brigands and over 7,000 
thieves whose wrongdoings have not been exposed living in our 
midst. All our efforts and means are directed toward exposing 
these grave crimes and identifying and detaining the guilty 
parties. 
  This in general was the criminal situation in the oblast 
last 
year. We cannot call it extreme, but we predict an even more 
difficult situation whose control will require the effort of all 
forces and the attraction of all available means.

"Gaydar Would Call It Stabilization...On the Socioeconomic 
Position of Sverdlovsk Oblast in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993 enterprises of the oblast produced 5.4737 
trillion rubles [R] worth of products in current prices, which 
is 6.5 times more than last year's production volume. 
  In comparable prices, the volumes of industrial production 
were 17 percent below the 1992 level, and the reduction of 
volume in 1992 as compared to the level of the preceding year 
was 27.4 percent, that is, the rates of reduction have slowed 
up. At the same time the highest rates of reduction of volumes 
of production of products occurred during the first and fourth 
quarters, and the lowest during the second and third quarters. 
  The main reasons for the reduction of production volumes 
were 
the difficult financial position of the enterprises caused by 
nonpayments of buyers of products, lack of material resources 
and difficulties with the sale of products, and numerous 
production shutdowns. The greatest losses were observed at 
enterprises of machine building and metal processing and light, 
chemical, and petrochemical industries. 
  The basic volume of products (56.6 percent) was produced by 
enterprises with a mixed form of ownership. They make up 29.7 
percent of the overall number of enterprises, and 49.1 percent 
of the industrial production personnel work at them. State 
enterprises, making up 55.5 percent and employing 44.2 percent 
of the personnel, produced 37.7 percent of the overall volume of 
products. Additionally, there were 88 private enterprises and 
nine municipal enterprises functioning in industry along with 11 
enterprises that are the property of public organizations. 
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  A reduction of the volumes of the production of products 
occurred in all branches of industry but there were significant 
differences in terms of rates and scale. Thus light industry 
enterprises reduced volumes as compared to last year's level by 
25.2 percent, machine building--23.3 percent, nonferrous 
metallurgy--22.8 percent, and the food industry--1.6 percent. 
  In the fuel and energy complex there was a reduction of the 
output of electric energy of 14.2 percent as compared to the 
1992 level, the extraction of coal--by 3.7 percent, and peat--by 
51 percent. 
  In ferrous metallurgy there was a reduction as compared to 
the 1992 level of the output of iron--by 10.3 percent, steel--by 
11.9 percent, high grade cold rolled steel--by 36.1 percent, and 
cold rolled sheet metal--by 66.4 percent. At the same time the 
production of finished rolled metal was 3.1 percent above last 
year's level and cold rolled steel strips--5.6 percent. 
  For a number of kinds of machine building products the 
output 
was below the 1992 level: The production of technological 
equipment for the processing branches of the agro-industrial 
complex decreased by 47.2 percent, diesel engines and diesel 
generators--by 40.3 percent, gas turbines--by 37.1 percent, 
large electrical machines--by 32.4 percent, excavators--by 13.4 
percent, blast furnace and steel smelting equipment--by 7.1 
percent, and machine tools with numerical programmed control--by 
66.7 percent (although the output of metal cutting machine tools 
exceeded the 1992 level by 35.4 percent). 
  Enterprises of the chemical-timber complex reduced the 
production of sulfuric acid by 18.6 percent as compared to last 
year's level, synthetic resins and plastics--by 16.7 percent, 
commercial timber--by 23.7 percent, lumber--by 27.3 percent, 
chip board--by 30.4 percent, and paper--by 57.2 percent. The 
output of passenger vehicle and motorcycle tires and nitrogen 
fertilizers remained at the 1992 level. 
  In the construction materials industry the output of cement 
increased by 1.4 percent as compared to last year, window 
glass--by 15.7 percent, ceramic facing tiles--by 4.2 percent, 
and ceramic sanitation items--by 3.5 percent. But there was a 
reduction of the production of construction brick--by 24.1 
percent and prefabricated reinforced concrete elements--by 17.7 
percent. Consumer goods production amounted to R836.9 billion, 
which in comparable prices is 6.9 percent below the 1992 level. 
For all groups of goods except wine and vodka and beer we did 
not manage to maintain the 1992 production volumes. 
  Food production amounted to R299.3 billion. The sharp 
decline 
in the production of food products in 1992 by 19.4 percent was 
replaced by a relative stabilization of their output in 1993 (a 
reduction of 0.8 percent as compared to the level of the 
preceding year). More meat was produced during the year--4,499 
tonnes (4.9 percent), butter--1,067 tonnes (14.9 percent), 
mayonnaise--1,701 tonnes (15.1 percent) and confectionery 
items--1,529 tonnes (2.2 percent). At the same time less 
semimanufactured meat products were produced--386 tonnes (1.8 
percent), whole milk products--27,061 tonnes (7.4 percent), 
margarine--10,136 tonnes (30.3 percent), vegetable oil--373 
tonnes (17.7 percent), and bread and bakery items--34,918 tonnes 
(6.4 percent). 
  Some R34.7 billion worth of wine and vodka items and beer 
was 
produced, which exceeds last year's level by 8.1 percent, as a 
result of increasing the output of strong alcoholic beverages, 
champagne, and beer. 
  At light industry enterprises there was a reduction of the 
production of fabrics by 24.2 percent, footwear--by 48.3 
percent, knitted items--by 19.8 percent, and the output of goods 
for children decreased by 31-67 percent. 
  The output of nonfood consumer goods (not including light 
industry goods) decreased by 9.2 percent, while this figure was 
6.8 percent in 1992. The production of motorcycles was 7.4 
percent less, enameled steel dishware--37.6 percent, 
bicycles--40.5 percent, and household goods--41.2 percent less. 
There was an increase in the output of certain kinds of 
complicated household equipment: kitchen appliances--by 38.4 
percent, television sets--by 167.8 percent, electric irons--by 
29.2 percent, and electric teapots--by 8.4 percent. At the same 
time there was a 39.2 percent reduction of the production of 
washing machines, video cassette recorders--53.5 percent, and 
radio equipment--56.3 percent. 
<H5>  Capital Construction </H5>
  In the oblast national economy during the report year fixed 
capital valued at R257.5 was introduced, including for 
production purposes--R140.7 billion (54.6 percent of the overall 
amount introduced, in 1992 it was 64.6). 
  During the report period 1,490,500 square meters of 
residential space was introduced (100.1 percent of the 1992 
level). At the same time there was a reduction of the rates of 
housing construction in 11 cities (35.5 percent of the overall 
number) and 18 rayons (78.2 percent). Among them were the cities 
of Irbit, Nevyansk, Serov, and Severouralsk, and the following 
rayons: Verkhoturskiy, Prigorodnyy, and Krasnoufimskiy. 
  General educational schools were introduced to accommodate 
8,837 (72.7 percent of the 1992 level), children's preschool 
institutions to accommodate 2,310 (65.3 percent), hospitals with 
639 beds (2.8 times more than in 1992), and polyclinics for 
2,702 visits per shift (149.7 percent). 
  The introduction of housing per one oblast resident amounted 
to 0.32 square meters (in 1992--0.31), children's preschool 
institutions--0.53 places for 100 children of preschool age (in 
1992--0.78), general educational schools--1.11 places for every 
100 school children (in 1992--1.54), hospitals--1.37 beds for 
every 10,000 residents (1992--0.48), and polyclinics--5.78 
visits per shift per 10,000 residents (1992--3.84). 
  Capital investments in the oblast economy amounted to R671.5 
billion (71.4 percent of the 1992 level in comparable prices). 
Of these R385.6 billion (57.4 percent; in 1992--61.2 percent) 
was used for production purposes. 
  Centralized capital investments in the oblast national 
economy amounted to R204.2 billion (98.0 percent of the 1992 
level), and of these, money from the federal budget amounted to 
R65 billion (63 percent of the 1992 level) and from local 
budgets--R139.2 billion (132.4 percent). Capital belonging to 
state enterprises and organizations amounted to R200.9 billion 
(38 percent of the 1992 level) and other forms of ownership and 
credit--R254.9 billion (136.1 percent of the 1992 level), and 
capital belonging to the population and housing construction 
collectives--R11.5 billion (71.8 percent of the 1992 level). 
  In the agro-industrial complex during the report year fixed 
capital valued at R25.7 billion was introduced, including for 
production purposes--R19.7 billion. There was a reduction of the 
volume of startup of housing and social, cultural, and domestic 
facilities: In 1993, 126,500 square meters of dwelling space was 
introduced (70.8 percent of the 1992 level), children's 
preschool institutions to accommodate 50 (18.9), schools to 
accommodate 960 (in 1992--71.4), and clubs and houses of culture 
to accommodate 360 (48.0). 
  As of 1 January 1994 there were 514 contracting and 
repair-construction organizations in operation (as of 1 January 
1993--514), of which 131 (192) were state, 4 (5)--municipal, 229 
(199)--with a mixed form of ownership, and 150 (118)--private. 
They performed contracting work in a volume of R504.7 billion, 
including by state enterprises--R93.6 billion (19.1 percent of 
the overall volume; in 1992--33.6), municipal--2.6 (0.5 percent; 
in 1992--0.5), with a mixed form of ownership--254.3 (50.4 
percent; in 1992-- 41.1), and by private organizations--R151.5 
billion (30.0 percent; in 1992--24.8). 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  The increase in the number of producers of agricultural 
products did not lead to an increase in their production. 
According to the estimate, the gross agricultural output 
decreased by 5 percent as compared to 1992. 
  In 1993 the gross yield of grain on all categories of farms 
amounted to 744,200 tonnes in weight after cleaning (73 percent 
of last year's level), potatoes--654,700 tonnes (72 percent), 
and vegetables--228,900 tonnes (121 percent). The production of 
potatoes was 139 kg and vegetables--49 kg per oblast resident. 
Grain production was concentrated mainly on agricultural 
enterprises and potatoes and vegetables--on private subsidiary 
farms belonging to the population. 
  By the beginning of 1994, 12,700 tonnes of grain had been 
added to state resources, which is 2.5 times more than last 
year; potatoes--26,000 tonnes (39 percent of the 1992 level), 
and vegetables--53,300 tonnes (76 percent). The proportion of 
grain procured as compared to the volume of its production was 2 
percent, potatoes--4 percent, and vegetables--23 percent. 
  The situation in animal husbandry is characterized by a 
reduction of the arrival of products from the farms of 
agricultural enterprises and simultaneously a small increase in 
their production in private yards of the citizens. For one 
resident of the oblast they produced 319 eggs, 199 liters of 
milk, and 36 kg of meat. 
  Agricultural enterprises sold 149,200 tonnes of cattle and 
poultry for slaughter (94 percent of 1992), including 
poultry--60,900 tonnes (99.8 percent); the milk yield--562,200 
tonnes (99.7 percent); and 1,374.1 million eggs were received 
(94.5 percent). The average milk yield from one cow was 2,681 kg 
and exceeded last year's level by 202 kilograms. 
  The reduction of the breeding herd led to a reduction of the 
production of young animals. During the report year as compared 
to the 1992 level we failed to receive 17,700 calves (7 percent) 
and 34,800 piglets (5 percent). Losses from death and 
destruction of hogs exceeded last year's level by 19,900 and 
cattle--by 200 head. As of 1 January 1994 the farms had 501,300 
head of cattle, including cows--193,200, horses--17,000 (92 
percent each), hogs--347,100 (93 percent), and 
poultry--13,706,100 head (97 percent). 
  State procurements of animal husbandry products (except for 
eggs) during January-December 1993 exceeded last year's level 
and amounted to: cattle and poultry--137,200 tonnes (101 
percent), milk--480,000 tonnes (102 percent), eggs--1,153.9 
billion (98 percent); the share from agricultural enterprises in 
state resources accounted for 94.1 percent of the meat and 99.2 
percent of the milk. The amounts purchased from the population 
were 7,400 tonnes (5.4 percent) of cattle and poultry and 2,400 
tonnes (0.5 percent) of milk, and the amounts purchased from 
farmers were 700 tonnes (0.5 percent) and 1,400 tonnes (0.3 
percent), respectively. 
  As of 1 January 1994 there were 3,119 farmers, which was 16 
percent more than at the beginning of 1993. Farmyards occupy 
91,200 hectares of land, including 57,300 hectares of plowed 
land, which amounts to an average of 18 hectares per one farm. 
<H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>
  There was a reduction of freight shipments on all kinds of 
transportation, including automotive--by 47 million tonnes (38.5 
percent), and rail--34.6 million tonnes (20 percent). The volume 
of shipments of freight and mail on air transportation decreased 
by 6,400 tonnes (37.2 percent). The reduction of the shipments 
of freight was caused by the reduction of the output of many 
kinds of products and also their concentration in warehouses of 
enterprises because of nonpayments. 
  Passenger turnover on general purpose transportation 
increased by 433.7 million passenger-kilometers (1.6 percent), 
including on rail transportation--by 2.3365 trillion 
passenger-kilometers (14.5 percent) and automotive--by 32.3 
million passenger-kilometers (0.5 percent). Passenger turnover 
on air transportation decreased by 1.9351 trillion 
passenger-kilometers (47.7 percent). 
  The quality of passenger service is still poor. There was a 
considerable deterioration of the work of city transportation in 
Yekaterinburg. Each week buses and streetcars fail to make up to 
13 percent of the planned trips, and trolleys--up to 10 percent 
of the trips. An investigation conducted by state statistical 
organs in November 1993 showed that during the morning peak 
hours every other bus passenger had to wait more than 20 minutes 
for a bus to come, as did every fifth streetcar passenger and 
every sixth trolley passenger. Time spent traveling to work and 
back amounted to an average of 1.5 hours a day, but 16 percent 
of the passengers (every sixth one) spends more than two hours. 
Three-fourths of the passengers questioned mentioned the 
crowding of the transportation vehicles during the morning peak 
hours. Only 2 percent of those questioned used the subway. 
  Commuter train and bus service for the population of the 
city 
of Yekaterinburg is getting worse. The number of scheduled 
suburban trips has been reduced. During January-February 1993 
each week the schedule included 2,400 suburban trips, and during 
November-December--only 2,100. 
  As of 1 January 1994 there were 14 joint-stock companies 
operating in the general purpose automotive transportation 
system (25 percent of the overall number). They moved 62 percent 
of the freight and 8 percent of the passengers. 
  During 1993 communications enterprises received R34.7 
billion 
in revenues from their basic activity, including R8.8 billion 
from the population. The volume of communications services in 
physical terms decreased considerably: The delivery of 
newspapers, magazines, and parcels--twofold, and letters, 
printed material, money transfers, and telegrams--by one-fourth. 
  The number of telephones in cities of the oblast increased 
by 
21,200 (4 percent), and in rural locations--by 600 (1 percent). 
At the same time the number of city and rural automatic 
telephones decreased by 404 (6 percent) and interurban ones--by 
143 (17 percent). 
<H5>  Finances </H5>
  In 1993 the consolidated budget of Sverdlovsk Oblast 
received 
R837.3 billion in revenues, which is 10 times more than last 
year's level. The main sources of revenue are still: profit 
tax--R449.2 billion, income tax from citizens--R147.6 billion, 
value added tax--R87.1 billion, property tax--R19.2 billion, and 
excise tax--R18.2 billion. But because of the unsatisfactory 
financial conditions of a number of enterprises and 
organizations, the debt on payments to the oblast and local 
budgets continues to grow. As of 1 January of this year its 
amount reached R49.5 billion. 
  Budget expenditures amounted to R829.7 billion and increased 
11-fold. Financing the national economy took R287.8 billion, 
public education--R180.7 billion, public health and physical 
culture--R203.7 billion, culture and art--R16.3 billion, 
science--R0.7 billion, and stipends and compensation payments 
for children amounted to--R16.5 billion. 
  The consolidated oblast budget ended up with a surplus (with 
revenues surpassing expenditures) of R7.6 billion. 
  According to preliminary calculations, the sum of profit 
received by enterprises and organizations of the oblast during 
1993 will amount to R1.750 trillion. State enterprises account 
for 43 percent of all the profit, and nonstate enterprises--57 
percent. Based on the results of their operation over 11 months, 
losses were sustained by 306 of the more than 2,100 enterprises 
considered. The sum of their losses amounted to R5.4 billion. 
  Credit indebtedness of industrial, construction, 
transportation, and agricultural enterprises and organizations 
as of 1 December amounted to R1.4344 trillion, of which R438.9 
billion or 30.6 percent was defaulted. The monetary funds of the 
enterprises, which amounted to R110.5 billion, covered their 
credit indebtedness by 7.7 percent, including in industry--7.8 
percent, construction--5.4 percent, transportation--10.7 
percent, and agriculture--5.9 percent. 
  Significant amounts of defaulted credit indebtedness are 
related to the existence of debit indebtedness. As of 1 December 
debit indebtedness amounted to R1.5395 billion, including 
defaulted debts--R538.8 billion, 92 percent of which are 
defaulted debts of buyers. 
<H5>  Prices and Rates </H5>
  In December 1993 as compared to December 1992 consumer 
prices 
for goods and services rose 8.5-fold (not including 
non-necessities--8.6-fold), and wholesale prices for industrial 
products--10.7-fold. The growth rates for food and nonfood goods 
were considerably below the rates of prices and rates for paid 
services to the population, which increased 33.5-fold during the 
year. 
  In 1993 subsidies were allotted to producers of agricultural 
products for livestock, milk, and eggs, and there was regulation 
of wholesale prices of monopoly enterprises, rates for certain 
socially significant kinds of services, and also trade 
increments for a number of goods, which undoubtedly retarded the 
growth of prices. 
  In December 1993 as compared to the level of December of the 
preceding year vegetables became 16 times more expensive, milk 
and dairy products--15 times, and eggs--12 times. Prices of meat 
and poultry, sausage and macaroni items, and potatoes increased 
9-10-fold; fish, butter and vegetable oil, flour, bread and 
bakery items--7-8-fold; and cheeses, margarine, and 
confectionery--6-7-fold. For fabrics, knitwear, leather and 
textile footwear, tobacco items, radio equipment, and electrical 
goods prices rose 3-4-fold, and clothing, rubber footwear, and 
furniture--5-fold. The highest growth was for medications--an 
average of 36-fold. 
  Of the services rendered to the population, the greatest 
price increases were for services of a legal nature and of 
banking institutions (386-fold) and also institutions of culture 
(86-fold). Rates for passenger transportation and communications 
and prices of medical service and housing services increased 
17-19-fold, and consumer and tourist-excursion services and 
services for keeping children in preschool 
institutions--22-24-fold, and the cost of passes to 
sanitorium-health resort and health institutions rose 26-fold. 
The least growth in rates occurred for municipal services 
(11.3-fold). 
  As of the end of December in retail trade in the oblast the 
following average prices developed for the main food products: 
beef--R2,058 per kg, butter--R3,327 per kg, potatoes--R287 per 
kg, sugar--R812 per kg, eggs--R752 for 10, and milk R301 per 
liter. There is still a considerable differentiation of prices 
among the various cities (rayons) of the oblast. The minimum 
price for a liter of milk in the oblast in December was R123 and 
the maximum--R524; for 10 eggs--R405 and R930, respectively, for 
a kilogram of beef--R1,800 and R2,943, for butter--R2,765 and 
R4,485, for sugar--R620 and R848, and for potatoes--R70 and R360. 
  The greatest disparity of prices among the various cities 
and 
rayons of the oblast is still for paid services to the 
population. Thus the disparity in prices for laundry services 
was 10-fold, hotels--12-fold, bathhouses--25-fold, 
dormitories--80-fold, and medical service--from 10-fold to 
39-fold. 
  Prices of food products at city markets in 1993 increased 
more slowly than they did in state trade. In December 1993 as 
compared to December 1992 at the markets meat increased in cost 
on average 7.8-fold, milk, sour cream, and cottage 
cheese--6.6-fold, and potatoes and vegetables--14-fold. As 
before, the market price level was higher than prices in 
organized trade. At the end of December the average price level 
at city markets for meat was R2,474 per kg, sour cream--R4,254 
per kg, cottage cheese--R1,780 per kg, potatoes--R363 per kg, 
and milk--R656 per liter. 
  Prices of producers of industrial products grew at more 
rapid 
rates than did consumer prices, and in December 1993 as compared 
to December 1992 they increased for products for production and 
technical purposes 10.8-fold, and for consumer goods--9.5-fold. 
Since September the growth rates of prices for industrial 
products have begun to drop and in December they were the lowest 
in the report year--11.6 percent. In December a smaller increase 
in prices than in all the preceding months of 1993 was found in 
ferrous metallurgy, forestry and light industry, in which, as 
compared to December 1992, prices increased on average 
10-12-fold. Prices increased most during the year in electric 
energy engineering, especially electric energy for agricultural 
consumers (91-fold). Rates for electric energy for industrial 
consumers increased 16.7-fold, for electric commuter rail 
transportation--23-fold, for city transportation--37.5-fold, and 
for thermal energy--on average 35.7-fold. The rates for the 
shipment of freight for all kinds of transportation in December 
1993 as compared to December 1992 increased almost 23-fold, 
including automotive--11.5-fold, air--15.2-fold, pipelines 
(gas)--20.9-fold, and rail--26.7-fold. 
<H5>  Commodity Turnover </H5>
  Retail commodity turnover, including the sale of goods for 
hard currency, amounted to R1.2673 trillion, including in the 
trade network--R1.1787 trillion, and at public catering 
enterprises--R88.6 billion. In actual prices commodity turnover 
exceeded last year's level 10-fold, but in comparable prices it 
was 5.3 percent less. 
  Retail commodity turnover of all officially registered trade 
enterprises developed as follows: 39.6 percent (in 1992--54.9 
percent) of all the goods were sold in the state sector, and in 
the private sector--47.9 percent (35.6 percent), at enterprises 
of the consumer cooperation system--5.8 percent (9.3 percent), 
and at other nonstate enterprises--6.7 percent (0.2 percent). 
  Commodity supplies in warehouses of the retail network of 
officially registered trade enterprises as of 1 January 1994 
amounted to R202.5 billion, which was R496.5 million (2.5 
percent) more than as of the beginning of last year. This volume 
of commodity resources could maintain continuous trade for 28 
days. 
  There was an increase in the proportion of nonfoodstuffs In 
the structure of retail commodity turnover in 1993. 
  The situation in the foodstuffs market was relatively 
stable, 
but the assortment and quality of the products and the prices 
did not always meet consumer demand. In spite of the constant 
availability of practically all foodstuffs for free sale and 
their active sales, the low buying power of the population 
allowed them to acquire less food than in past years, although 
there was an increase in sales in the main commodity groups. 
  The situation with the provision by state trade 
organizations 
of potatoes and vegetables for the population is worse than in 
previous years. By the beginning of the winter season in the 
storage facilities of the trade network there was less for 
long-term storage than last year: potatoes, onions, and 
carrots--by half, and cabbage--by one-third. The volumes that 
were stored up were practically 50 percent less than the amount 
sold annually in the trade network. 
  The provision of the population with nonfoodstuffs improved 
last year, with R597.9 billion sold. The stores were saturated 
mainly because of costly goods and increased foreign 
procurements by commercial structures. According to accounting 
data, more than half of the fabrics, clothing, and footwear 
brought into the oblast, up to 40 percent of the business goods, 
and 30 percent of the haberdashery items are imports. 
  In turn, one-fourth of the commodity mass produced in the 
oblast is shipped outside, including one-third of the finished 
knitwear items, one-fourth of the felt footwear, one-half of the 
hosiery items and leather footwear, and 70-80 percent of the 
radio equipment, motorcycles, and motor scooters. 
  The following was sold to the population of the oblast 
during 
the year: clothing and underwear--1.1 times more than during 
1992, hosiery items--1.2 times, footwear--1.1 times, silk 
fabrics--1.8 times, and cotton fabrics--1.3 times. The demand of 
the population for cultural and domestic goods is not 
declining--99,100 radios were sold (1.8-times more than last 
year), and television sets--92,200 (1.7-times). Of the goods in 
daily demand there was an increase in the sales of toilet soap 
by 15.5 percent (5,500 tonnes were sold), household soap--30 
percent (4,200 tonnes), and detergents--61.5 percent (13,200 
tonnes). The sale of wool fabrics and knitted items did not 
reach last year's level. 
  The volume of sales of paid services amounted to R125.8 
billion, but in physical terms the population received half the 
volume of services rendered in 1992. 
  The sale of paid services was mainly at enterprises of the 
state and municipal sectors, which accounted for 83.0 percent of 
the total volume. Enterprises with the mixed and private forms 
of ownership accounted for 16.5 percent of the overall volume of 
paid services, and 0.5 percent was at enterprises that are the 
property of public organizations. The greatest decline in the 
number of orders was for consumer services--repair of housing 
and furniture, laundry, and dry cleaning. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Activity </H5>
  Product exports amounted to R520.9258 trillion in domestic 
prices or $892 million in foreign trade prices. The volume of 
goods delivered for freely convertible currency was R82.2799 
trillion in domestic prices or 15.8 percent of the overall 
volume of exports. 
  The largest proportion of the overall volume of exports was 
made up of raw and processed materials--93.9 percent. The 
proportion of machines and equipment was 3.5 percent; equipment 
and materials for facilities under construction abroad with 
technical assistance from the Russian Federation--0.8 percent; 
consumer goods--0.3 percent; and services--1.5 percent of the 
overall volume of exports. The main export items are metals 
and items made from them, chemical products, ores, and 
concentrates. 
  The largest exporting enterprises are: the NTMK Joint-Stock 
Company--48.5 percent of the overall volume of exports, the VIZ 
Joint-Stock Company--3.4 percent; and the Bogoslovskiy Aluminum 
Plant Joint-Stock Company--2.9 percent. 
  Among the countries delivering raw materials, the 
industrially developed countries are in the lead. Thus imports 
from Japan amounted to $9,447,000., the United States of 
America-- $9,237,000, Austria--$7,809,000, and 
Germany--$5,220,000. 
  During 1993, $581.4 million was deposited in the foreign 
currency accounts of enterprises and organizations. Foreign 
currency revenues from exporting products amounted to $461.1 
million, services--$42.7 million, and other revenues--$77.4 
million. A total of $562.4 million in foreign currency funds 
were spent, including for importing products--$97.1 million, 
services--$2.6 million, and other payments--$96.1 million. 
Foreign currency amounting to $366.4 million was sold. 
<H5>  Exchanges </H5>
  During the year the five exchanges held 946 trading sessions 
and concluded 5,120 transactions. The turnover of the exchanges 
amounted to R55.0597 trillion. More than half of the 
transactions--56.6 percent--were for the sale of products for 
production and technical purposes, and commodity turnover 
amounted to R23.4783 trillion. 
  Monetary resources that were sold amounted to R16.2194 
trillion, of which R8,068.5 were credit resources and R8,150.9 
were deposit resources. Security sales amounted to R7.8805 
trillion, including stocks--R3.4437 trillion, options--R2.3932 
trillion, and privatization checks--R2.0436 trillion. 
<H5>  The Standard of Living of the Population </H5>
  After the sharp decline in 1992 the standard of living of 
the 
population stabilized at a mark considerably below that of the 
pre-reform period. Monetary incomes of the population increased 
10.2-fold, reaching R41,000 per one resident per month. In 
December the nominal per capita monetary income amounted to 
R95,000. 
  According to data from an ongoing selective study of family 
budgets, during the fourth quarter 14 percent of the families 
were on the threshold of poverty, which is defined by the 
physiological minimum for nutrition (R38,100), 41 percent were 
underprivileged families with income per one family member 
between the poverty threshold and the subsistence minimum, which 
is evaluated by the consumer basket, which is valued at R71,500. 
The proportion of these families decreased from 69 percent in 
the fourth quarter of 1992 to 55 percent during the same period 
of last year. 
  There was a 10 percent increase in the proportion of 
families 
with incomes equal to the value of one to two consumer baskets. 
There were more well-off families (with an average per capita 
income equal to the value of two to four consumer baskets)--8 
percent, while a year ago they made up 5 percent, and for the 
first time it was possible to single out rich people--0.4 
percent of the families have an average per capita income in 
excess of the value of four consumer baskets. As a result of the 
continuing stratification of the population, the average level 
of per capita income of the 10 percent of the most well-off 
citizens was 7.7 times above the corresponding level of the 10 
percent of the least well-off. 
  Bank deposits of the population as of 1 January 1994 
amounted 
to R125.8 billion. The increase in savings of the population in 
deposits and securities (bonds, certificates, treasury notes) 
reached R108.5 billion and increased 13.3-fold as compared to 
the preceding year. 
  The AVERAGE ANNUAL NUMBER OF WORKERS was 1,785,900 (not 
counting workers at small enterprises), which is 4.2 percent 
less than in 1992. 
  A one-time study of the employment of the population 
conducted by statistical organs during the period from 20 
through 31 October 1993 encompassed 0.3 percent of the 
population between 15 and 72 years of age living permanently in 
the cities and rayons (except Garinskiy and Tabsoinskiy) of 
Sverdlovsk Oblast. As a result it was discovered that of the 
overall number studied, 62.1 percent had work and 3.1 percent of 
them were looking for different or additional work. Of the 
number who did not have work, 8.2 percent were looking for it, 
including those registered with the employment service as 
unemployed--1.4 percent, those not looking for work--36.2 
percent, and those who did not need to work--55.6 percent. 
  The number of citizens applying to the employment service 
regarding questions of labor placement amounted to 80,563 at the 
end of 1993, 46,832 of which were women. 
  The demand for labor force continues to decrease. 
Notifications by enterprises of the need for workers decreased 
as compared to the beginning of the year by 17.4 percent and as 
of 1 January 1994 amounted to 5,459. 
  As of 1 January 1994, 28,015 people were officially 
recognized as unemployed, of whom 17,471 received compensation. 
Women make up 67.2 percent of the unemployed. The number of 
youth under 29 years of age among the unemployed decreased by 2 
percent as compared to last year and amounted to 36.0 percent. 
  During the year R1,165.1 million was spent for payment of 
compensation, including R235.7 million during December. 
  The average annual wages in the oblast reached R59,551, 
which 
is 8.8 times above last year's level. In December in the oblast 
wages amounted to R133,554, and the average amount of material 
assistance and benefits per one worker was R25,312. 
  According to preliminary figures, the population as of 1 
January 1994 amounted to 4,665,300. There remains a tendency 
toward decrease of the birth rate and increase of the death rate 
of the population. In 1993, 4,400 fewer children were born than 
in the preceding year, and the coefficient of the birth rate 
(the number of births per 1,000 population) decreased from 9.5 
in 1992 to 8.6, or by 10 percent. 
  The decline of the birth rate is explained not only by 
objective demographic factors but also by the deterioration of 
the socioeconomic situation in the oblast. These same factors 
can explain the continuing rise of the level of the death rate 
of the population; during the past year the number of deaths 
increased by 10,700. The coefficient of the death rate (the 
number of deaths per 1,000 residents) was 15.0, and in the 
preceding year it was 12.7. There was a 9 percent increase in 
the coefficient of infant mortality; 19 children die out of 
every 1,000 births. The number of deaths in 1993 exceeded the 
number of births by 30,000. 
  As a favorable factor in the demographic situation one can 
observe a certain increase in the number of marriages--by 1,300. 
  By the beginning of 1994 on the territory of the oblast 
there 
were 4,000 refugee families registered and only 8,400 who were 
forced to resettle. The majority came from Tajikistan--42 
percent, from Georgia--23 percent, and from Azerbaijan--9 
percent. Two-thirds of them are Russians, and then come Greeks, 
Armenians, and Tatars. They are settling mainly in Yekaterinburg 
and other large cities of the oblast; 824 people have settled in 
rural areas. 
  During the year internal affairs organs registered 108,123 
crimes--1,528 less than in 1992. There were 5,435 fewer crimes 
committed in Yekaterinburg and 1,768 more crimes committed in 
the other territories of the oblast. The proportion of these 
crimes increased from 18.7 percent to 23.6 percent. The number 
of premeditated murders increased--1,097 (last year--898), 
premeditated serious bodily harm--3,334 (2,662), torture--650 
(550), and rape--587 (last year--466). As a result of the crimes 
that were committed, 2,828 people died. The number of property 
crimes decreased by 5 percent compared to last year, and their 
proportion in the structure of crime is the highest--74 percent; 
there was a 4 percent increase in crimes against public order 
and the health of citizens, and the number of crimes against 
individuals increased by 26 percent. The number of people who 
had committed crimes who were found out was 44,165. 
  During the year 45 rallies and demonstrations were 
registered 
in the oblast in which more than 278,000 people participated, 
four strikes, with a total of 1,704 strikers, and 18,822 work 
days were lost. 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  The year 1993 is characterized by the completion of 
"small-scale" privatization and the beginning of privatization 
of enterprises of the base branches of the national economy. As 
of 1 January 1994 2,828 enterprises in the oblast had been 
privatized (which was about one-third of the number of 
enterprises owned by the state), including 1,610 in 1993. The 
number of privatized enterprises increased 2.3-fold as compared 
to 1992. Of the overall number of privatized enterprises, 74.3 
percent were completely bought out, of which 58.5 percent were 
bought in 1993, which exceeds the 1992 rates 1.4-fold. By the 
time of their privatization more than 620,000 people were 
employed at these enterprises. Privatization of enterprises and 
individual facilities was conducted in all cities and rayons of 
the oblast except Garinskiy, Pyshminskiy, and Taborinskiy. 
  With the development of "large-scale privatization" there 
was 
an increase in the proportion of federally owned enterprises in 
the overall number of those privatized from 8.6 percent in 1992 
to 16 percent in 1993, and the proportion of enterprises 
privatized through the creation of joint-stock companies 
increased from 0.7 percent to 18 percent. The most widespread 
form was privatization of enterprises on a competitive 
basis--41.5 percent; 8.1 percent of the facilities were sold at 
auction; and 27 percent of the enterprises were purchased by 
collectives who were leasing the property. The sales price 
exceeded the initial price 4.5-fold as compared to twofold in 
1992. 
  Earnings from privatization of enterprises (facilities), 
including joint-stock companies, during 1993 amounted to 
R10.2179 trillion, which was 90.4 percent of the volume of 
monetary funds envisioned by the oblast program for 
privatization for 1993. From privatization of municipally owned 
enterprises they received R6.3225 trillion (61.9 percent), 
oblast owned--R499.1 million (4.9 percent), and federally 
owned--R3.,3963 trillion (33.2 percent). Of the earnings, 41.8 
percent was transferred into local budgets, 25.6 percent--into 
the oblast budget, 13.9 percent--into the federal budget, and 
18.7 percent went to state privatization organs. 
  During the year 276,500 apartments were turned over to 
private ownership of citizens; this is 23.1 percent of the 
number of apartments subject to privatization. The overall value 
of privatized apartments is estimated at R17.919 trillion. The 
local budget received R32.7 million. Since the beginning of 
privatization of the housing supply (July 1992) a total of 
364,700 apartments (30.4 percent) have been sold to the citizens 
for private ownership. 
<H5>  Environmental Protection </H5>
  As compared to last year investments in environmental 
protection measures decreased by 20 percent (in comparable 
prices) and amounted to R26.392 trillion. Of the overall volume 
of capital investments, 56 percent went for protection and 
rational utilization of water resources, 28 percent--for 
protection of the air, and 4 percent--for protection and 
rational utilization of land. 
  During the year 29 cases of surging overflows and discharges 
of pollutants were registered. They led to extremely high levels 
of pollution of the environment. The overall total damage 
amounted to R88.4 million. 
  Discharges of pollutants into bodies of water in excess of 
the norm were allowed by almost every fifth enterprise of the 
975 that were investigated, and every sixth one of the 1,096 
inspected was functioning while exceeding the maximum 
permissible discharges into the atmosphere. 
  In 1993, 521 cases of forest fires were registered, 9,400 
cubic meters of timber burned or was damaged in the stand, and 
the damage caused by forest fires is estimated at R7.6 million. 
Forest restoration work has been conducted on an area of 59,500 
hectares, 41.6 percent of which are planted in seeds and 
seedlings.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "Rossel Persists"] </F>
  [Text] The all but buried and long-forgotten plan for 
the Ural Republic has risen like a phoenix from the ashes. 
  Last week former Governor Eduard Rossel, now a senator from 
Sverdlovsk Oblast, officially submitted a package of documents 
to the Federation Council in an attempt to legalize the Ural 
Republic. Copies of the documents were forwarded to the State 
Duma. According to plan, the State Duma should pass a law to 
change the status of the federation member, and the Federation 
Council should ratify it. 
  Both will require the support of a two-thirds majority. 
Eduard Rossel and his fellow countrymen in the Duma have 
launched an intense lobbying campaign. The former governor, who 
was removed from office by the RF president precisely for his 
declaration of the Ural Republic, asserts that he is finding 
support in the higher chamber. Furthermore, he is winning the 
support of not only senators from krays and oblasts, but also 
senators from republics who were previously against this idea. 
In the lower house, parliamentary hearings on the Ural 
initiative have already been scheduled for 18 April. 
  On his next trip to Moscow, the ex-governor hopes to talk to 
the leaders of political parties and parliamentary factions: 
Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, and Gaydar. He has special hopes for his 
meeting with Vladimir Volfovich, who is "always talking about 
the equality of federation members." Sergey Shakhray, the leader 
of the PRES and the minister for federation affairs who is 
willing to support the idea of a Ural Republic extending to at 
least two oblasts, but who objects to a republic confined within 
the boundaries of only Sverdlovsk Oblast, was given a copy of 
the constitution of the Ural Republic, autographed by Rossel: "A 
keepsake, an example of the construction of a strong Russian 
state." 
  "This will be a colossal breakthrough," Eduard Ergartovich 
told the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent. "We are the flagship. 
If we break through the lines, all oblasts can have the same 
status in the future." 
  In the words of the ex-governor, "after the blow we were 
dealt, none of the oblasts is claiming the right to republic 
status and its own constitution." The new Russian Basic Law, 
however, gave each oblast the right of legislative initiative 
and the right to approve its own charter. This started a run on 
the Sverdlovsk Oblast legislative drafts. According to Rossel, 
all krays and oblasts, without exception, quickly analyzed the 
text of the Ural constitution and copied it in their own 
charters. There was no need to rack their brains: All they had 
to do was preface the text with their own title: "Charter of X 
Oblast." 
  In view of the fact that the new Russian Constitution 
proclaimed the equality of federation members, can the 
duplication of the Ural constitution in the kray and oblast 
charters serve as a practical method of realizing this desired 
equality? Can this give new life, "a second wind," to Rossel's 
own initiative, which seemed to have been stifled completely by 
the president's stern decision? 
  The Ural constitution does not grant the federation member 
the kind of privileges that were granted to Kazan, for example, 
in the treaty with Moscow. There is one article, however, which 
Rossel calls a "major breakthrough": The declaration that 
anything within the boundaries of Sverdlovsk Oblast "belongs to 
the Ural Republic." On this basis, local economic laws can be 
published and local economic programs can be launched. There 
would be no need for the dozens of economic agreements Kazan 
concluded with Moscow. Everything would be defined by local 
laws. The Ural Republic is being used as a model in several 
oblasts, such as Ulyanovsk Oblast, for example, where bicameral 
representative bodies of government will be empowered to make 
laws. 
  "We see the Ural Republic as the prototype of the 
territorial 
division of the Russian Federation," Chairman Vasiliy Tarasenko 
of the Senate Committee on Federation Affairs, the Federation 
Treaty, and Regional Policy told the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA 
correspondent after he had read the package of Ural documents. 
He warns that they still need careful examination. "If, however, 
they do make references to regional or territorial legislation, 
I would welcome this. All krays and oblasts need good basic 
legislation today." 
  Rossel has less chance of success in the Duma. The Duma 
Committee on Federation Affairs and Regional Policy insists that 
the general principles of the federal process must be 
consolidated before specific forms of this process can be 
regulated. Chairman Vladimir Lysenko of the Subcommittee on the 
Development of Federal Relations believes that Rossel's idea is 
less relevant now that the new Russian constitution has granted 
federation members equal rights. "As soon as this equality was 
declared, the other oblasts seem to have calmed down and stopped 
making demands. Precedents can be quite dangerous in Russia, 
however, and if the Ural Republic wins approval, the others will 
begin demanding the same treatment, and this process will be 
impossible to stop." 
  The next "breakthrough" in the federal process could be 
accomplished in different ways: either by elevating the status 
of a particular RF member or by concluding a separate treaty 
with one of them. The "breakthrough" could occur far from the 
Urals (Kaliningrad Oblast was the first claimant) and could have 
completely different consequences, especially in view of the 
fact that Chechnya and Tatarstan--and not the Urals or 
Kaliningrad--are still the main source of headaches for central 
government officials.

<F P=106> [Report of Tyumen Oblast Statistics Committee: "The Amount </F>
of Money Is Substantial but Insufficient"] 
  [Text] Businessmen and organizations in the oblast earned 
1.2 trillion rubles in profit in the first 11 months of 1993. 
Around 84 percent of all the profit in the oblast was earned by 
industrial enterprises and transport organizations. The higher 
profits in these branches were mainly due to higher wholesale 
and retail prices. 
  The majority of industrial enterprises and agricultural, 
transport, and construction organizations are experiencing 
financial difficulties. This is attested to by data on the 
status of mutual settlements between the buyers and producers of 
goods. 
  Overdue payments on incurred debts (or nonpayments) 
increased 
by 586.2 billion rubles (or 42 percent) in November 1993, and 
nonpayments on credit debts increased by 482.1 billion rubles 
(36 percent). (Incurred debts are all of the debts owed to 
enterprises--Ed.) 
  Almost one out of every two enterprises was unable to pay 
its 
debts to creditors on time. Financial conditions are 
particularly unsatisfactory at the Otdelochnik-20 and 
Sibkomplektavtotrans joint-stock companies of the closed type, 
the Tobolsk Meat Combine, the Surgut Municipal Dairy, the 
Gydansk Fish Plant, the Vagay Joint Timber Association, the 
Feniks joint-stock company, the Mir Sovkhoz, and the Sibir 
Kolkhoz. 
  There were no overdue payments on credit debt in the 
Kogalymtruboprovodstroy Trust, the Ishim Reinforced Concrete 
Products Plant, the Surgut Meat Processing Combine, the 
Tyumenskiy Dom Khleba open joint-stock company, the Akva 
joint-stock company, the Pyshminskoye closed joint-stock 
company, and the Marma Oil Company. 
  Enterprises in the petroleum refining industry now owe the 
budget 567.2 billion rubles, or 80 percent of all nonpayments to 
the budget in the oblast. Overdue payments to the budget amount 
to 127.3 billion rubles for the Yuganskneftegaz joint-stock 
company, 79.2 billion for Langepasneftegaz, 62.4 billion for 
Kondpetroleum, and 43 billion for the Noyabrskneftegaz 
Production Association. 
  Oblast enterprises applied for bank credit and loans to 
supplement their financial resources. Their total debt amounted 
to 341.6 billion rubles (including 19.3 billion in overdue 
payments). This figure is lower than the figure for 1 November 
1993. 
  Deposits in State Bank branches in the oblast from savings 
banks in 1993 were 24.4 times as high as the 1992 figure, 
receipts from rail, air, and water transport were 20.6 times as 
high, the receipts of enterprises of the Ministry of Railways 
were 15.9 times as high, local transport receipts were 6.8 times 
as high, and the receipts of consumer service enterprises were 
9.6 times as high. The rate of increase in receipts in the 
oblast was slightly lower in January-December. 
  The amount of money put into circulation in the oblast was 
2.0721 trillion rubles. This was 11 times as high as last year's 
figure.

<F P=106> [Report of Tyumen Oblast Statistics Committee: "More New </F>
Structures, Fewer Products"] 
  [Text] Output and Deliveries of Manufactured 
Goods: The process of forming new entrepreneurial 
structures was more intense in 1993. At the beginning of 1994 
there were 154 joint-stock companies (45 percent of the total 
number), 26 commercial partnerships (8 percent), and 14 leased 
enterprises (4 percent) engaged in industrial production. The 
number of joint-stock companies was six times as high as at the 
beginning of 1993, and the number of partnerships was three 
times as high. The number of leased enterprises was reduced by 
more than half. 
  Oblast industry produced goods worth 7.2127 trillion rubles 
in existing prices, with state enterprises accounting for 94 
percent, mixed enterprises accounting for 5 percent, and 
municipal and private enterprises accounting for 0.4 and 0.6 
percent respectively. Enterprises of the Khanty-Mansiysk 
Autonomous Okrug produced 71.2 percent of the total output, 
enterprises in the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug produced 19.6 
percent, and enterprises in the south of the oblast produced 9.2 
percent. 
  The growth of production volume (or the maintenance of the 
previous volume) at enterprises of the Rosneftegaz corporation 
and Gazprom concern began to stabilize the output of 
manufactured goods in the oblast as a whole and in the 
autonomous okrugs in October 1993. Production volume is still 
decreasing, however, at enterprises in the southern zone. Output 
decreased at the turbo-machine and Ishim Agricultural Machinery 
plants, the Zavod ATE joint-stock company, the Ishim 
Machine-Building Plant, the Tobolsk Petrochemical Combine, and 
other enterprises. 
  Production Output in Physical Terms: The output of 
petroleum and gas condensate at oblast enterprises in 1993 was 
35.6 million tonnes (or 13.7 percent) below the figure for 1992 
and amounted to 224.7 million tonnes, including 218.6 million 
tonnes of oil. Most of the oil (98.8 percent) was produced by 
enterprises of the Rosneftegaz corporation, and the rest was 
produced by enterprises of the State Geology Committee (0.7 
percent), the Urengoygazprom Production Association (0.4 
percent), and the Krasnoleninskneftegazgeologiya state 
enterprise (0.1 percent). 
  The Kalchinsk subdivision of the Tyumenneftegaz Scientific 
Production Association and the Tyumennedra state enterprise 
produced 50,300 tonnes of petroleum in Uvatskiy Rayon. 
  The average daily output of petroleum and gas condensate at 
the end of 1993 was equivalent to the 1977-78 level and amounted 
to 615,600 tonnes. This was 13.5 percent below the 1992 figure 
and 0.5 percent below the figure for January-November 1993. The 
output decreased at all enterprises of the Rosneftegaz 
corporation, with the exception of the Varyeganneftegaz 
joint-stock company. 
  The output of natural gas was 3.1 percent below the 1992 
figure. The average daily output was 2.8 percent below the 
previous year's figure. 
  Urengoygazprom, the largest gas production association, 
produced 24.8 billion cubic meters, or 8.6 percent, less than it 
had produced the previous year. 
  There was a decrease in the output of electricity, liquefied 
hydrocarbon gases, synthetic resins and plastics, metal-cutting 
and woodworking machine tools, oil production equipment, 
technological equipment for light industry, tractor and vehicle 
trailers and semi-trailers, agricultural machines, building 
brick, prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and 
elements, and other items. The output of all of the main 
products of the timber and woodworking industry also decreased. 
  The output of diesel fuel, batteries, and disposable needles 
and syringes increased.

<F P=106> [Report of Tyumen Oblast Statistics Committee: "Work in </F>
`Automatic Stop' Mode"] 
  [Text] Industrial enterprises in the oblast employed 
304,500 people in January-November 1993: 52 percent in the 
Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, 20.4 percent in the 
Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, and 27.6 percent at enterprises 
in the south of the oblast. Funds designated for consumption 
during that period amounted to 611.2 billion rubles, with wages 
accounting for 89 percent of the total and financial assistance 
and special incentives accounting for 11 percent. Funds for all 
personnel were equivalent to 10.5 percent of the total 
production output. The average wage of people employed in oblast 
industry in November was 317,300 rubles, and the figure in the 
southern zone was 123,600 rubles. 
  In December there were work stoppages in some production 
units at 17 industrial enterprises (3 in the Khanty-Mansiysk 
Autonomous Okrug and 14 in the south). They included the 
Nadezhda joint venture, the Zavod ATE joint-stock company, the 
Ishim Machine-Building Plant, plants of the Ishim Agricultural 
Machinery Production Association, the electrical machinery 
plant, the DSP-250 plant, and other enterprises. 
  The main reasons were difficulties in selling products and 
shortages of material resources. The stoppages led to the 
dismissal of 151 workers in December, including 125 from Ishim 
Machine-Building Plant. Another 4,012 workers had to take an 
unpaid leave at the administration's request. 
  Production Expenditures: Expenditures per ruble of 
commercial product were 14.3 percent above the figure for 
January-November 1992 and amounted to 82.7 kopecks. Expenditures 
decreased by 5 percent at enterprises in the oblast's southern 
zone and amounted to 70.68 kopecks. Expenditures per ruble of 
commercial product increased in all branches of industry except 
the chemical and petrochemical industry, machine building, and 
metal working. 
  Expenditures were much higher than they had been the 
previous 
year at the Chernogorneft closed joint-stock company (by 145.8 
percent), the Langepasneftegaz joint-stock company (58.5 
percent), enterprises of the Nizhnevartovskneftegaz Association 
(31.7 percent), the Megion, Mezhdurechenskiy, and Pionerskiy 
timber associations, the Lina joint-stock company, the 
electrical machinery plant, and other enterprises. 
  Meanwhile, production expenditures decreased at the Tobolsk 
Meat Combine, the Tyumen Bread Combine, the Serginoles 
joint-stock company, the Sovetskiy Saw Mill and Woodworking 
Combine, Vinzili firm, and other enterprises.

  [Text] Colonel-General Nikolay Golushko, director of the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK), had a conference in 
Moscow with Tyumen Oblast and Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk 
autonomous okrug administration chiefs Leonid Roketskiy, 
Aleksandr Filippenko, and Lev Bayandin, Tyumen Oblast 
Presidential Representative Gennadiy Shcherbakov, and 
Major-General Anatoliy Antipin, chief of the oblast FSK 
administration. 
  They discussed the structure of local counterintelligence 
agencies and their objectives in view of the present critical 
state of the fuel and energy complex. A decision was made to 
form a regional FSK administration for all three members of the 
federation in Tyumen Oblast and to reduce the staff of the 
former oblast office of the Ministry of Security by 12 percent 
for the more effective safeguarding of the security of the 
strategic facilities of the fuel and energy complex and the 
performance of other functions defined in the statute on the FSK 
of 5 January 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Grachev: "Not That Bad?"] </F>
  [Text] The heads of oblast law enforcement agencies had a 
meeting with journalists last Wednesday at the suggestion of the 
oblast administration. 
  I have to say right away that I do not share the skeptical 
views of some of my colleagues with regard to this gathering. It 
is true that the specific purpose of the press conference was 
absolutely obvious: Deputy Administration Chief Valeriy Bagin, 
who conducted the press conference, frankly admitted that the 
crime rate is rising, but the public must not lose all hope. Law 
enforcement agencies are doing their job in spite of all 
obstacles and are adapting to the new conditions. Criminals do 
not feel as unconstrained as some news programs have suggested. 
  It seems to me that this is a valid statement. The reason 
for 
the rising crime rate is not the unsatisfactory performance of 
the police, the courts, or the procuracy. The main cause is the 
steady disintegration of the economy and all the foundations of 
our daily life. The personnel of the police force, the courts, 
the procuracy, and other law enforcement agencies that did not 
leave, in spite of all inducements, and move into the 
comfortable offices of commercial structures--where everything 
is peaceful and where the pay is much higher--might deserve more 
respect today than anyone else, in spite of all the remaining 
problems, in spite of the fact that people feel the need to hide 
behind iron gates, and in spite of the fact that "every flock 
has its black sheep." 
  The statements at the press conference were reserved: The 
situation is still under control, thank God, and has not reached 
the point of total chaos and lawlessness. Furthermore, there 
have been some successes: Several homicides that were "pending" 
for several years were recently solved, the organizers of the 
recent notorious and bloody fights between mafia clans were 
exposed and arrested, and the invaluable canvases of the Russian 
old masters that had been stolen from the Tyumen Art Gallery 
were recovered. Even the president heard about this case. The 
devastated service for the prevention of economic crime is being 
revitalized to some extent. 
  It is extremely difficult to do this work today. As I look 
through my notes, the following details stand out: Viktor 
Simonov, administration chief in the State Trade 
Inspectorate--subjected to intense psychological pressure by 
criminal gangs during inspections of commercial stores, around 
90 percent of which are paying protection money to racketeers. 
Valeriy Borisov, chief of the regional administration for action 
against organized crime--identified more than 100 criminal gangs 
and broke up over 30 of them last year. The gangs are 
well-organized: They have power structures, fighting forces, and 
economic divisions for the "laundering" of money, the 
organization of credit operations, and so forth. Last year the 
regional administration solved more than 400 serious 
crimes--homicides, cases of extortion, and racketeering. 
Veniamin Basharin, chief of the oblast internal affairs 
administration: The criminals feel invulnerable. They commit 
murders here and then go abroad--to Kazakhstan, Georgia, or 
Armenia. Ten people were arrested in connection with the mafia 
clan warfare and two are still at large. The main culprit--a 
professional hired killer--was "brought to light" in Kazakhstan, 
but our request for his extradition led to a whole series of 
other events. It took the threat of road blocks on all 
highways--so that not one vehicle carrying lumber or anything 
else could reach Kazakhstan--before the murderer was finally 
turned over to us. Our neighbors in Sverdlovsk Oblast also 
experienced bloody confrontations and have not found the guilty 
parties yet. In the words of V. Basharin, the present 
irresponsible behavior of some citizens is interfering with the 
performance of police work: People cannot be arrested for 
vagrancy. They do not have to work if they do not want to. They 
are free to make their own choices, but this is a breeding 
ground for criminals. Witnesses are another big problem. They 
are completely unprotected by the state and the law and are 
intimidated and threatened. People are afraid of saying 
anything, and criminals escape responsibility for crimes because 
of a lack of evidence. There are many other problems as well, 
but the number of solved crimes was nevertheless higher than in 
1992 in some areas. V. Belyayev, chairman of the oblast court: 
Legal protection should not depend on attendant circumstances, 
but it does. Judges are not the problem: They will work as many 
hours as they have to. The problem is the shortage of jurors. 
People do not want to serve on juries. By law, their place of 
employment pays them the average wage for the time they spend in 
court, and who wants that? There are not enough auxiliary 
personnel in the courts, no process servers, no gasoline, no 
vehicles or guards to bring the criminals to court, etc. 
Witnesses cannot be called because people are afraid. 
  That is the situation in our law enforcement agencies today. 
As I have already said, however, they are still doing their job. 
They have finally begun taking action against people who take 
bribes: Last year they investigated 146 cases of bribery. The 
figure is not that high, but at least there has been some 
progress. They prevented 120 crimes connected with forged bank 
remittance notes during the year, saving 46 billion rubles. 
  Someone asked when the agencies would restore order in the 
market: The prices there, after all, are being set by the market 
mafia. Simonov replied that the market is a matter of constant 
concern to the State Trade Inspectorate. Prices drop as soon as 
the inspectors arrive, but the next day they are raised again. 
Basharin said that a special office of the internal affairs 
administration had been opened to take charge of the market, and 
he assured the press that order would be restored. All of the 
same problems still exist: There are no witnesses to testify. 
People either do not want to get involved or are simply afraid. 
Nevertheless, the situation in the market will get better. The 
registration of "foreigners" from the former fraternal 
republics, who are largely responsible for the present situation 
in the market, should be a big help. Those who behave 
unscrupulously run the risk of losing their licenses, and that 
does have an impact. 
  There were understandable questions about the amnesty. In 
view of the present crime wave, no one at the press conference 
was in favor of this. The prognosis was that this would cause 
more outbreaks of criminal behavior and that things would get 
worse. 
  There were many other questions as well. Some of the answers 
were reassuring and some were not. The law enforcement officials 
agreed to hold regular press conferences. I had the idea that it 
might be best to arrange for televised conferences of this kind 
once or twice a month for the whole oblast population, so that 
the people who have locked the iron gates of their homes can see 
that they can rely on the services of the police force, the 
courts, the procuracy, the trade inspectorate, and even the 
former State Security Committee, now renamed the 
Counterintelligence Committee, all of the individuals entrusted 
to combat corruption, the illegal drug traffic, and the theft of 
our national resources. They could take a look at these people 
and ask them--if they have a telephone--whatever they want to 
ask them, and find out what lies ahead. What bothers the people 
most, after all, is the uncertainty and unpredictability of 
events and the extremely depressing suspicion that the state and 
its law enforcement agencies have simply forsaken all of us. 
Mutual understanding is a great achievement, especially at a 
time of crisis.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Shilnikov, economic correspondent: "The </F>
Negotiations Are Over"] 
  [Text] On 11 February "groups of experts from Tyumen 
Oblast, the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, and the 
Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, having discussed the drafts of 
the treaty submitted by the State Committee of the Russian 
Federation and Tyumen Oblast in conjunction with the 
Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous okrugs, agreed on 
the following": 
  Subsection One: "It is necessary and possible to combine" 
the 
drafts of the treaty submitted by Tyumen Oblast and the 
Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous okrugs for the 
purpose of elaborating a single, agreed draft treaty on this 
basis. 
  "Necessary and possible"--this is quite good in itself. What 
is the subject of the treaty? Take a look at the second 
subsection: "The subject of the treaty is the whole group of 
interrelations" between Tyumen Oblast and the two okrugs. 
  Let us move on from the subject of the treaty to the title. 
It is listed in the third subsection: "The working title of the 
treaty is the Treaty on the Interrelations of Tyumen Oblast, the 
Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, and the Yamalo-Nenetsk 
Autonomous Okrug--with a specific reference in the text of the 
treaty to the status of the parties to the treaty as autonomous 
and equal members of the Russian Federation." 
  An old Russian adage tells us: "Go ahead and call it a pot 
if 
you wish, but do not put it on the stove." This is not the case 
here, and this is why I have quoted the third subsection in its 
entirety. 
  This is the time to say something about the structure of the 
treaty. Experts are experts, and they make provisions for these 
"minutiae." This, therefore, is the structure: the preamble, the 
general provisions, the principles of interrelations, the 
interrelations of state governing bodies, interrelations with 
agencies of local self-government, interrelations with federal 
government agencies and their territorial structures, 
humanitarian contacts, the settlement of disputes, and the final 
provisions. 
  As we can see, everything is specified in detail. This was 
the fourth and last subsection of the protocol of consent, and 
now it is time to move on to the protocol of dissent. It 
consists of only one sentence: "The groups of experts from 
Tyumen Oblast, the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, and the 
Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, having discussed the drafts of 
the treaty submitted by the State Committee of the Russian 
Federation and Tyumen Oblast in conjunction with the 
Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous okrugs, could not 
reach a general consensus on the interpretation of the term used 
in Article 66 (4) of the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation--autonomous okrugs constituting part of the 
oblast--and the term proposed jointly by the groups of experts 
from the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous 
okrugs--`autonomous okrugs located within the 
territorial-administrative boundaries of the oblast.'" 
  The protocol of dissent is cited exactly as written, down to 
the last comma. The fourth subsection of Article 66 of the 
Constitution is a serious matter and, in general, there is no 
reason to expect the parties to find a common language in a 
hurry. After all, why would an okrug want to give up its 
constitutionally guaranteed status as an equal member of the 
federation? The very fact that the experts met for this 
conference suggests that the oblast administration has 
reconsidered its methods of solving the problem of oblast unity 
and has given up making decisions "from a position of strength" 
in favor of making decisions "from a position of probability." 
  This is not a bad change, particularly from the standpoint 
of 
the economy. After all, while they were fighting, they managed 
to cause considerable destruction. To put it more precisely, 
they managed to miss several opportunities. All I have to add is 
that the oblast administration was represented by the following 
experts: G. Chebotarev, L. Berezin, and S. Nikitin; the 
Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug was represented by G. Tikhonov, 
N. Usoltsev, and V. Sharafilov; the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous 
Okrug was represented by A. Arteyev and G. Chudnovskiy. 
  Now all of this is a matter of public record.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Reznik, IZVESTIYA staff: "Sakhalin, Too, </F>
Is Beginning a `Gas' War"] 
  [Text] Khabarovsk Kray--Gas stoves are not working in the 
homes of residents of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, and primus and 
kerosene stoves have been taken out of storage. The city central 
heat and power station has shifted from burning natural gas to 
burning residual fuel oil. Once again, the Sakhalinmorneftegaz 
Association has grabbed the Komsomolsk-on-Amur residents "by the 
throat" and cut off the supply of the blue fuel. 
  This time the reason for such harsh measures was not a delay 
in mutual settlements but the petroleum that, along with the 
gas, is discharged from Sakhalin wells in the form of 
condensate. The islanders were sending it, like the gas, to the 
"city of youth" through the pipelines whose construction was 
hailed in the well-known novel Daleko ot Moskvy 
[Far From Moscow]. The price for it was cranked up immensely -- 
to 140,000 rubles per tonne. If the Komsomolsk Petroleum 
Refinery had continued to take raw material at that price, it 
would have long since gone bankrupt. The petroleum refinery 
found suppliers with a better-quality and less expensive 
product--the Tyumen oil fields, which are delivering petroleum 
to Khabarovsk Kray at R110,000 a tonne. The Sakhalin people did 
not rack their brains trying to figure out how to lower the 
price of their oil, but decided to act from a position of 
strength--they delivered an ultimatum to the 
Komsomolsk-on-Amur's residents: either take our oil at our 
prices, or we will close the valve on the gas pipeline. 
  They closed it, forgetting that Khabarovsk Kray could take 
countermeasures. After all, Sakhalin receives up to 70 percent 
of its economic cargo by way of the Vanino-Kholmsk ferry 
crossing. However, to the credit of the kray's leaders, this 
time, as during the first such incident last year, they have 
been showing restraint and reasonableness. Residual fuel oil, 
jet fuel and all other goods addressed to the island oblast are 
being punctually dispatched to it. The kray's administration has 
sent an emergency telegram informing the Russian president and 
head of government of the existing situation. The law, not 
arbitrary rule, should act.

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Anokhin: "Solovetsk Miracles, or How 434 </F>
Voters Cast 1604 Ballots"] 
  [Text] Passions aroused by the December parliamentary 
elections have not yet settled, and now Russians will have new 
elections in March and April, this time for local government 
bodies. The Russian President's Edict No. 1765 allows 
administration chiefs to approve local election statutes 
themselves: The parliament is only just beginning to consider a 
general federal law. One doesn't have to be a genius to imagine 
what will happen. However, much is already clear: Read our 
item. 
  "There is a vast bureaucratic plot against democracy in the 
country, which took shape just before the parliamentary 
election," says Vladimir Rasskazov, former people's deputy and 
chairman of the banking subcommittee of the Russian Federation 
Supreme Soviet, retired vice-chairman of the Russian Central 
Bank, and current president of the All-Russian Stock Bank. "I 
know from personal experience that local nomenklaturas were 
given complete control over the elections to the Federation 
Council." 
  Like every businessman, he supports his statements with 
specific documents and facts, although many of them are clearly 
colored by the pain of a person who has lost an election 
campaign. Vladimir Rasskazov ran for the Russia's Choice bloc 
for an Arkhangelsk Oblast seat in the Federation Council. His 
opponent, Yuriy Guskov, chairman of the Arkhangelsk Oblast 
Soviet and before that first secretary of the Arkhangelsk Oblast 
CPSU Committee, was nominated as candidate by the Russian 
Communist Party. He won by 9,000 votes. In Vladimir Rasskazov's 
view, this was a result of machinations, forgery and outright 
legal arbitrariness of the local powers that be. Nor was it only 
the issue that communist representatives could conduct their 
campaigns directly at enterprises during work hours, which 
democratic candidates could not. Or that the oblast radio would 
fall silent "for technical reasons" precisely when broadcasting 
an interview with Vladimir Rasskazov. 
  Much more mysterious was the kaleidoscope of number errors 
in 
the Arkhangelsk election returns. Thus, 42,000 ballots more were 
cast for the Federation Council election than in the federal 
district, where parties and blocs were determining their 
standing with the people. What does this suggest? Two 
assumptions come to mind: Either the voters deliberately failed 
to cast their "party" ballots, or someone deliberately stuffed 
the ballot boxes with extra "paper" ballots, which decided the 
outcome of the race for the upper chamber of parliament. 
  There are many such flaws. For example, the total number of 
ballots issued to voters or cancelled was 118,508 less than the 
number of registered Arkhangelsk voters. One can think of many 
reasons for this. Say, again blame voters who for some reason 
put the lacking number of ballots in their pockets. But is it 
possible that more than 100,000 people would want to commit an 
identical prank? Or could one justifiably say that voter turnout 
in the oblast was expected to be low, so fewer ballots were 
printed in order to save paper. 
  For all its peculiarities, the complex existing situation 
may 
not have aroused so many distortions if Vladimir Rasskazov or 
his representatives had a document stating the total number of 
printed ballots, indicating how many were handed out and how 
many remained in reserve. The absence of such information has 
aroused the most evil suspicions of the losing side: Where the 
ballots "saved" before or after the election? Try and find out 
now, while 116,000 election ballots account for almost 20 
percent of the vote. 
  Also surprising are the "miracles" of the Solovetsk election 
precinct, where 434 voters cast a total of 1,604 ballots. It is 
hard to imagine that in their civic enthusiasm the Solovetsk 
citizens managed to vote several times. Was this some 
unfortunate accident? Quite possible, but if the mistake was 
discovered and not corrected one can't help thinking of direct 
fraud. 
  "Nevertheless," says Vladimir Rasskazov, "a preliminary 
count 
of votes in Arkhangelsk, Severodvinsk and Novodvinsk, which 
include half the district constituents, showed that 1.7 times 
more had voted for me than for my opponent. Seeing this, the 
district commission immediately halted ballot collection for 
three days. In the final result Yuriy Guskov was already 
ahead..." 
  Incensed by such "democratism," Vladimir Rasskazov prepared 
papers and appealed to the Central Election Committee and 
procurator agencies, seeking a recount of the Arkhangelsk Oblast 
ballots. So far with no result. 
  "As fate would have it, the Central Election Committee's 
complaint commission is headed by P. Zhigaltsov, an Arkhangelsk 
crony of Yu. Guskov," says the would-be deputy, explaining the 
reason for his unsuccessful quest for the truth. 
  The first thing that comes to mind after talking to him is: 
Here is a person who has lost an election and now seeks to make 
a political issue of it. New times breed new traditions. And all 
his appeals to courts and procurator offices, allusions to the 
biased makeup of election commissions "formed back in 1989 by 
the communists," and "the absence of the possibility to monitor 
their actions by democratic forces" could be seen as an effort 
to create "publicity" around his name with an eye on future 
elections. 
  You must agree that if something like this were expounded by 
some run-of-the-mill politician or a representative of the 
humanities his words could be classified as populism. But the 
assertions of a ranking banking-brokerage executive well versed 
in the intrigues of the powers that be, moreover an economic 
scholar with two university degrees who acquired professional 
experience both as a director at the Computer Center and in 
academic and research work at the economics and management chair 
of a technical college, tend to ring true. Moreover, the results 
of the latest election reflect, as on a screen, the strategic 
redeployment of the communist-soviet nomenklatura forces, 
bringing hidden secrets to light. 
  Understanding that the democrats' political prestige depends 
on the local successes of the changes taking place, and that the 
apparat plays a key role in this process, the nomenklatura, 
having regained consciousness after the August debacle, hastily 
began to deploy its people over the entire vertical of power. 
Launching a personnel offensive, it soon gained control over 
Russia's major regions. Suffice it to cite facts for just a few 
of them (see table).

  In Krasnoyarsk Kray, every other city or rayon 
administration 
chief is a former CPSU apparatchik. And if one considers 
personnel who completed the Higher Party School, then it is all 
of 80 percent... 
  This was described and happened two years ago, but for some 
reason we only now seem to have overcome amnesia and are 
worriedly asking: How come that in, say, Penza Oblast 40 out of 
45 seats in the legislative assembly have gone to former party 
committee secretaries, deputies of disbanded soviets, directors 
of plants and state farms, and other local leaders of communist 
orientation? And now, egged on by Sergey Filatov, chief of the 
Russian president's administration, and Nikolay Medvedev, chief 
of that administration's department for work with territories, 
the democratic chorus has suddenly voiced its alarm at the 
possibility of the formation of a "red belt" made up of regions 
with strong anti-reform moods around Moscow and the return of 
the local party-managerial nomenklatura to power. 
  Actually, it never lost that local power, only adapting 
deftly to circumstances. We all remember the metamorphoses when 
the leaders of party committees of various levels 
instantaneously, like a shoal of fish following some signal 
known only to them, occupied leadership position in soviets of 
the respective levels, and then, with the same alacrity, moved 
over to the positions of administration chiefs. Now, again in 
consort, they are occupying the seats of dumas and other 
legislative bodies. Today the entire nomenklatura force is 
following their bosses in the "personnel offensive." Which is to 
say that so far the only "belt" around Moscow has been "red."

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Latypov: "Alas, Moscow Has Cooled Toward </F>
Us: The Center Is Far Away, Economy Is a Shambles, and Only We 
Ourselves Can Save the Kray"] 
  [Text] This was more or less the tone of the conference 
held by the kray administration last week. Among those present 
were deputy heads of the kray administration, heads of 
administrations and committees, as well as of the fuel and power 
generation complex, a large group from the military, and trade 
unions. 
  "Lately we feel acutely that the government has cooled off 
quite noticeably toward the Maritime Kray," said the kray 
administration head, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko. It is practically 
impossible to "wring out" the money due as envisaged by Decree 
No. 1001. And the thorniest issue, which practically separates 
our kray from Russia's central regions, is high transportation 
rates. Instead of somehow helping the Far East in this respect, 
the Russian Federation Government just a few days ago made a 
decision to raise them again by more than 20 percent. 
  What the result will be is clear. High costs will force many 
enterprises located in West Siberia, in the Urals, and the 
European part of Russia to reroute the flow of export cargo. Now 
it will go abroad through the ports on the Black or Baltic Sea. 
This trend already is detectable. The following data point in 
this direction: Freight volume at the Far Eastern segment of the 
railroad system fell off by 37 percent. Naturally, the output of 
our plants and factories, and most importantly, mining 
enterprises, will not be competitive in the regions where 
industrial consumers are and which are long distance away from 
Maritime Kray. 
  In this situation, a vitally important question comes up 
with 
all urgency: How is Maritime Kray to survive? Vladimir 
Kolesnichenko, who is considered the most knowledgeable and 
competent economist in the kray, predicts this development of 
the situation. In May, electric power rates will go up. This 
blow will push a considerable number of kray enterprises into 
bankruptcy. They are already literally being strangled by hidden 
unemployment. It runs by most modest estimates at 25-40 percent 
of enterprises' labor force. One can, of course, understand the 
directors--they still hope for some mythical subsidies and 
preferential credits. But there will be none. Therefore, says V. 
Kolesnichenko, we need to take radical steps right now. We have 
to immediately set up a commission that will determine the 
backbone enterprises in the kray capable of surviving at the 
current stage of transition to a market. Those labor collectives 
that cannot survive we should declare bankrupt and start finding 
jobs for the people. 
  The first to go bankrupt, in V. Kolesnichenko's opinion, are 
enterprises in the cities where mining combines and 
machine-building plants are located. It is Dalnegorsk, Arsenyev, 
and the settlement Kavalerovo. We can already see the validity 
of this forecast--the mining and enrichment combine in 
Khrustalnyy is practically dying. 
  The kray administration presented at the conference its plan 
for saving Maritime Kray from the impending destructive 
processes; the plan had been drafted by Moscow academics and 
executive branch departments. It was decided to "bring it into 
proper shape" during March, incorporate proposals of economic 
managers and the military, and then send the document for 
consideration to the Russian Federation Government. 
  N. Pimenov, the chief of the kray administration's main 
planning and economic administration, related to the conference 
participants the gist of this plan. According to the document, 
the priority sectors will be defense, foreign economic 
relations, and transportation. In order to move it all from the 
a centralized-economy state into a market-based one, the 
government will have to provide financial support. Otherwise, 
nothing will come out of it. Here is why. The government owes 56 
billion rubles [R] to our defense plants, even those where it 
had placed orders. (For instance, production of the "Black 
Shark" helicopter at the Progress plant.) And now they are 
literally dying at the root. 
  Next. One may say that the government forgot about the 
existence of its troops and their high concentration in Maritime 
Kray. Take the cost of the Pacific Fleet alone! The center 
practically keeps them on a financial starvation diet. The kray 
is compelled in extreme cases to provide money for the military 
from its own budget. And quite substantial sums, sometimes. The 
result is that in addition to paying taxes, Maritime Kray 
residents carry an additional load, which affects the social 
sphere. 
  Foreign economic relations. Maritime Kray already has in 
operation five vehicle crossings and eight ports open for entry 
to foreign vessels. What does the territory get from it? 
Nothing. Only 10 percent of the customs duty goes into the kray 
budget; the rest goes to the center. The document proposes to 
leave the entire customs duty collected in the kray for about 
two years. 
  The transportation complex cannot be improved without 
targeted federal programs. Ports and port-adjacent rail stations 
need to be developed, new branch lines built. All of this 
requires government investment money. The program proposed in 
the document assumes, of course, subsidies from the federal 
budget. And this is not dumping one's problems on the 
center--these are precisely the expenditures the state has to 
finance: maintenance of the Armed Forces, development of foreign 
trade and large transportation systems. As to our own business, 
says the kray leadership, it is time to pay very close attention 
to the development of the entire spectrum of relations with the 
countries of the Southeast Asia and the Pacific region. The 
following fact is quoted in support of this argument: In order 
to bring grain from Altay Kray, Maritime Kray has to pay 
agricultural producers and the railroad R270,000 per tonne. 
Transportation of the same tonne from Canada will cost R100,000. 
A tangible difference. And it is visible in everything.

<F P=106> [Article by German Orlovskiy: "The Debt Predicament"] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Federation Committee on Pricing Policy 
has established effective 10 March 1994 the maximum index of 
tariff increases for freight shipments in intra- and interstate 
transportation in the amount of 1.20 of the tariffs in effect 
prior to that date. 
  To what degree does the decision of the Russian pricing 
department affect the railroads and clients of the maritime 
region? Viktor Yefimovich Lyannykh, deputy chief of the freight 
and commercial operations section of the Vladivostok Division of 
the Far Eastern Railroad, provides commentary. 
  "Following the directive of the Committee on Pricing Policy 
came the order of the Ministry of Railways with a specific 
deciphering of the financial aspects with our business partners. 
In particular, it was prescribed that the tariffs for intrastate 
transportation would be applied to export-freight shipments 
through Russian border and port stations. 
  "Additional charges will be applied over and above the 
tariffs and fees (with the exception of export-freight 
shipments, including to the Baltic countries), consisting of a 
tax of 20 percent and special 3 percent tax (for financial 
support to the most important sectors of the national economy). 
The application of a maximum index of 1.20 to existing payment 
rates for other operations and services is authorized. But in 
order to preclude monopolistic pressure from being applied to 
clients, the ministry has established an upper limit of 
profitability for operation and services in the amount of 35 
percent. 
  "The measures being undertaken by the ministry are not for 
the sake of enjoyment. The ministry itself is operating at a 
loss. The Far Eastern Railroad, for example, has entered `minus 
6 billion rubles' in the `Profits' column. Losses from 
transportation operations include rising costs of fuel and 
electric power, spare parts--now in short supply--for diesel 
locomotives and freight cars, outlays for worn-out track, cross 
ties, and switching-signal sections. 
  "And prospects for the future are cloudy. The transportation 
business is in decline. The enterprises--our clients--are 
shutting down production output. Our partners of yesterday are 
turning their attention with ever increasing frequency to motor 
vehicle transport. Short-run motor vehicle transport has been 
more convenient, more advantageous, and quicker. Thus, the 
railroads are facing a struggle for clients who want efficient 
execution of orders and high-quality service. 
  "In the meantime, a natural process of reduction of our 
worker contingent has begun. We are not taking action to effect 
this, but neither are we accepting people for work. 
  "And then we have that same old situation today concerning 
debts receivable. They are colossal! The list of enterprises in 
debt to us for transport spans 10 pages--they owe us R12.5 
billion. 
  "We are trying to restrict our acceptance of freight for 
transport from those dispatching enterprises that are most 
steeped in debt. But this is a two-edged sword: When enterprises 
do not ship production output, they do not get paid for it. And 
they do not settle accounts with us either. While the state 
treasury tells us to hand over the required amount, think about 
paying wages later. 
  "The only aspect, undoubtedly, that does not distress 
everyone is the following point of the ministry order: `The 
boosted index for tariffs in effect is not applied with respect 
to small, lightweight shipments of freight and citizens' 
household goods being transported by intra- and interstate 
transportation.'"

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Moshkov, head of the Novosibirsk </F>
Oblast migration service, and Mikhail Bakshin, his deputy, by 
SOVETSKAYA SIBIR correspondent G. Sassa; place and date not 
given: "Siberia Can Be Warm, Too: Refugees' Fate"] 
  [Text] This service is located at Krasnyy Prospect, 
in the former national economic council building. It occupies 
just three small rooms on the fourth floor. The entire staff is 
six people. The problems the migration service is dealing with 
are many, however, and all of them are difficult, requiring a 
lot of hard work and human empathy. 
  The Russian Federal Migration Service was set up 
recently, when the Soviet Union disintegrated, when tens of 
millions of Russians suddenly found themselves abroad and in a 
number of places deprived of elementary human rights. The word 
"refugees" entered our vocabulary. 
  Our correspondent met with Yuriy Mikhaylovich Moshkov, 
the head of the Novosibirsk Oblast migration service, and 
Mikhail Sergeyevich Bakshin, his deputy. 
  [Sassa] Tell me please, what is the trend in the migration 
process? Has the flow of refugees not diminished during winter 
months? 
  [Answer] We also assumed that the cold Siberian winter would 
reduce the number of people coming here. We were mistaken. The 
same number--450-550 people--arrive every month as did in the 
summer. Last year our oblast accepted more than 40,000 refugees 
and forced resettlers. All in all, more than 2 million people 
arrived in Russia. The time of year and weather conditions have 
no effect on flow intensity. If people leave behind apartments, 
dachas, everything they have accumulated over the years, it 
means that they absolutely cannot live in these conditions. We 
talk to every person, listen to their sad, tragic tales, and 
therefore have a good idea of the situation in which our 
compatriots have found themselves. We see people who are barely 
clothed, semi-starved. Here, for instance, a young woman from 
Tajikistan. Not a kopek, head uncovered, no passport, no labor 
service book. Turns out that her home was hit by a bomb. We took 
her to the social protection department. They gave her a cap, 
jeans, some other things, and R5,000. The militia issued papers 
to her. Then they started looking for a job, which is very 
difficult now. Finally they found her a job as an attendant in 
one of the hospitals. She lives right there. Or a Georgian 
family--husband, wife, two children. They made it from Sukhumi 
to Moscow. No money to buy tickets to go from there. The woman 
sold the only valuable possession--her wedding ring. They called 
acquaintances in Novosibirsk, who sent the money. This was 
enough for three tickets. The mother and children came to our 
city. The husband is still in Moscow. 
  [Sassa] So it is not only Russians who are coming here? 
  [Answer] Most are Russians, of course. But there are also 
many people of other nationalities. There are many Armenians, 
Ukrainians, Tatars, Tajiks. Some Azerbaijani, Moldovans, 
Chechens, Abkhazians, Germans, Ossetians, Kazakhs, Turks, Jews, 
Chuvash... People of all kinds of professions, including 
doctors, teachers, and scientists. 
  The telephone rings. Yuriy Mikhaylovich greets the caller, 
listens, and says: 
  "No, no. You cannot delay the move. You absolutely have to 
be 
in place by March or April. Keep it in mind that potatoes and 
vegetables are planted in May here. And you absolutely have to 
have a vegetable garden--you have children. You know yourself 
what life is like... This is one of the farms in Moshkovskiy 
Rayon. There is housing, school, a cafeteria, running water. No 
money whatsoever? That is all right, we will help you with the 
move..." 
  Our conversation continues. 
  [Sassa] Does it not look like opportunities to house people 
and find jobs for them are dwindling? There are already 
unemployed and semi-unemployed in our oblast as well. 
  [Answer] This is true. Nevertheless, we are still able to 
somehow help the people left without any shelter. Our service 
maintains contacts with the employment and social protection 
services, with enterprises and organizations, with oblast 
rayons, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, joint-stock societies. Right now 
there are 5,500 job vacancies in the oblast. The demand is 
mostly for skilled workers and construction workers. 
  Fast development of commercial activities and the emergence 
of a large number of businessmen relieves some pressure. Many 
people found cozy jobs in commercial structures, they resell the 
goods bought from wholesalers. 
  Some agricultural enterprises help to house and provide jobs 
for people. There is the Aleksanxdrovskoye Joint-Stock Society 
[AO] in Maslyaninskiy Rayon, which is headed by Valeriy 
Ivanovich Prikhno. They accepted 14 families. More than 30 
resettler families received housing and jobs in Suzdalskoye AO, 
where Nikolay Nikolayevich Goryunov is the chairman. Iskitimskiy 
and Moshkovskiy Rayons build apartments and create jobs. 
  [Sassa] Where do they get the money? 
  [Answer] The Federal Migration Service helps. It does not 
have much money, but you can get some. If you knock on the door, 
they will open it. Take, for instance, the head of the 
Moshkovskiy Rayon administration. He personally went to Moscow, 
told of his plans, shared his troubles, and came back with R74 
million "in a pocket." The Aleksandrovskoye AO was among aid 
recipients. 
  We have to underline one important detail here. Many heads 
of 
administrations, and enterprise and farm directors do not use 
the opportunity to improve to a certain extent the situation of 
their collectives with the help of the migration service. There 
are many unfinished production facilities in villages and 
cities, as well as housing. If their construction is completed, 
it will produce new jobs and new apartments. But the owners do 
not have the money. This is where the migration service may 
become a magic wand. An economic manager submits a project for 
the facility to us, indicates how many new jobs it will create, 
and how many refugees he can accept and provide housing for. We 
send these documents to Moscow, and there is a good chance of 
getting positive results. 
  A telephone call. Yu. Moshkov: 
  "Fergana? What do you have? No, we do not pay for the move. 
We do not have housing. Why can you not live in Uzbekistan? 
Language... Well, the children should study Uzbek if you live 
there. Impossible to live... Well, you decide. If you come, you 
will get papers as refugees and temporary resettlers. What does 
it give you? The right to obtain a residence permit to live with 
relatives or acquaintances regardless of the size of their 
living space. Then you can get an interest-free loan for home 
construction. So you think about it..." 
  [Sassa] The call from Fergana has interrupted us... Are 
there 
examples that will support that your offer is realistic? 
  [Answer] Take the same Moshkovo. They are building 12 
apartments there. By the agreement with the migration service, 
which has provided the money, the oblast migration service will 
get six apartments intended for refugees; three apartments go to 
local authorities, to be distributed at their discretion; and 
three are placed at Moscow's disposal. 
  [Sassa] Moscow?! 
  [Answer] Yes, they have a very difficult situation there. 
Four and a half thousand refugees live in hotels, room-and-board 
facilities, and pioneer camps. We visited one such 
room-and-board facility. It is Vatutinka, which belongs to the 
Council of Ministers' economic administration. There are 118 
refugee families living there. It was decided to set up a 
rehabilitation center in this facility; equipment has been 
brought in, but they cannot install it. Refugees do not want to 
leave their temporary shelter. Moscow has to "unload" its 
refugees. Therefore, in the agreements the republic service puts 
in a clause that some apartments go to them. 
  Two young men enter the office. They are from Kazakhstan, 
from Semipalatinsk. Both are construction workers, have 
families, apartments. But no job. There are no prospects. It is 
impossible to sell the apartments. And even if they do sell 
them, it will be very cheap and only for local money. What are 
they going to do with this money in Russia? Yuriy Mikhaylovich 
and Mikhail Sergeyevich tell of the situation in the oblast: 
that construction workers will find jobs here; that one can now 
buy a house in a rural area with yard structures and a vegetable 
garden, inexpensive by current standards--about R4-R5 million. 
But the men do not have these "lemons." If the apartments could 
be sold as a noncash transaction and Kazakh money converted into 
rubles through official channels... The interlocutors take time 
to discuss the feasibility of such an operation... 
  The visitors leave with some hope. 
  [Sassa] So you are saying that refugees get free of charge 
the apartments built with the help of migration service? 
  [Answer] Yes, but under certain conditions. They do not have 
the right to sell or exchange the apartments, and must work in 
the organization to which the apartments belong. Because 
enterprises accept refugees in professions and skills they need. 
  [Sassa] One can understand it when Russians move from 
Central 
Asia, the Baltics, the Caucasus. But why do Georgians from 
Abkhazia not go to Georgia, or Armenians from Azerbaijan not 
want to go to Armenia? 
  [Answer] These people have learned what war is like; they 
have seen senseless bloodshed. They abandon everything they held 
dear and escape from hell to where at this point there is no 
shooting; where the situation is more or less stable; where they 
can save the children. 
  The Russian people are great in their generosity, 
good-naturedness, and hospitality. Themselves impoverished, 
humiliated, and insulted, having become "occupiers" and 
"strangers" in those newest states that they had protected, made 
them strong and prosperous; they share the last with the people 
crippled by fate. They understand that it was not these ordinary 
people who started the competition of sovereignties. 
  And so it became warmer in Siberia than in Central Asia or 
Transcaucasus. 
  And what if, God forbid, shooting begins here? We have no 
place to run... 
  Another telephone call. A young woman says: 
  "Thank you, good people!" 
  She and her husband came here straight from the train 
station. He has a Category II disability. Used to work as an 
explosives expert in a mine in Uzbekistan. Something happened: 
He got "pushed," with damage to the spine. Everything they had 
they have used up for food. Came here without a penny. 
  Problems cannot be solved in one day. The arrivals spent the 
night at a train station. Then spent another day there. 
  Meanwhile, people from the migration service were struggling 
to find a place for them to live. They talked a student 
dormitory superintendent into taking them in for just one night. 
Then they found the money to pay for one week in a hotel. 
Meanwhile, they were calling around at enterprises and 
organizations. Finally they found some gardening cooperative 
that hired the resettlers as watchmen. This means free room, 
electricity, a plot, and some pay. The gardeners helped with 
potatoes and vegetables. 
  The woman confessed once: 
  "I was on the verge on jumping in front of a train..." 
  Yuriy Mikhaylovich, a kindest man, exploded: 
  "Forget these idiotic ideas. Did you read Sholokhov's "A 
Man's Fate"; did you see the movie? Andrey Sokolov returned from 
war--everything has been destroyed, it lays in ruins. He has 
nothing but the clothes on his back. He took Vanyusha by hand 
and went to look for a new destiny... And you? You are still 
young!" 
  I was listening to this tale, looking at the window sill in 
Moshkov's office. Two different flowers shared one pot. Yuriy 
Mikhaylovich perked up: 
  "See, I found this bulb. Brought it here and stuck into the 
pot. Before you know it, a shoot came out. Leaves sprouted. A 
bud formed. And now look--it is blooming. It is holding to the 
soil by white threads, but what a beautiful red flower! I have 
to add more soil..."

<F P=106> [Report by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Vladimir Rozanov: "The </F>
Mayor Wants the City To Live by a Charter"] 
  [Text] The head of the Vladivostok administration, 
Viktor Cherepkov, announced in a television address on 9 March 
that on 27 March, simultaneously with the elections, he intends 
to hold a citywide referendum on two issues: Whether city 
residents think it necessary to shift to a single system of 
managing the city economy, liquidating rayon structures, and 
whether they approve the draft of the Vladivostok Charter, 
written by Cherepkov personally. The text of the charter has not 
yet been made available to city residents, however. 
  The city mayor explained the need for a general referendum 
on 
these two issues by such an important factor as Vladivostok 
entering market relations at a time when the city administration 
system has outlived itself and is no longer relevant. Viktor 
Cherepkov especially emphasized that introducing a centralized 
system in such matters as allocation of apartments and tax 
collection will allow, as he put it, correct justice to be 
achieved. 
  The Vladivostok Charter also is extremely important in the 
new economic conditions and political realities. Viktor 
Cherepkov said that city soviet deputies had worked on the 
charter earlier, and he continued what they had started, 
reducing the deputies' version to five pages. The mayor did not 
describe in detail the contents of the draft city charter, only 
saying that the charter will delineate the functions of the 
executive and representative branches of power in Vladivostok 
and the city's relations with kray and republic authorities. 
Viktor Cherepkov also said that he refused to put in the draft 
charter a provision that the city mayor serves at the same time 
as head of the city duma. 
  State law specialists, commenting on Viktor Cherepkov's 
address, told our VLADIVOSTOK correspondent that the city mayor 
is most likely attempting to widen his power base, protect 
himself in advance from duma interference in the mayoralty's 
affairs, and acquire maximum powers. Blessed by a popular vote, 
the charter may make the mayor practically absolutely 
invulnerable in his confrontation with kray authorities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Gilgenberg, Vladivostok city </F>
manager, by Raisa Fomicheva; place and date not given: 
"Vladimir Gilgenberg: `There Is Hope...'"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Aleksandrovich Gilgenberg, 38 years 
old, manager of the city of Vladivostok, married, has been 
nominated to the Kray Duma from the Republican Party. 
  [Fomicheva] Vladimir Aleksandrovich, you have power today. 
Quite a lot! You manage the city. What is prompting you to run 
for the Kray Duma? 
  [Gilgenberg] The law is being flouted here in the presence 
of 
all the branches of authority. Everyone has already sensed that 
it is bad living without deputies. Deputies are a restraining 
and controlling factor for the executive branch. They compel all 
the organs to work. 
  [Fomicheva] That is, you are moved only by a desire to help 
the kray? 
  [Gilgenberg] I decided several years ago that Moscow was not 
for me, I am a person of my own kray, my own city, [line missing 
in original] position, after all, it is a new one--city manager. 
  The position has existed for a long time in world practice. 
And if we are aspiring to a market economy, this kind of 
position will also exist. It is possible that it has not yet 
achieved the necessary level with my performance. At the present 
time, it is necessary to expend a lot of effort on the attacks 
of the kray administration, which authorized the subordinate 
organs not to subordinate themselves to the city mayoralty. But 
in the meantime we received a letter from the Ministry of 
Justice yesterday which states that the mayoralty is right on 
all questions. But they frayed our nerves for three months, and 
inflicted damage on the city in a useless fight. Who will answer 
for this? 
  [Fomicheva] What is authority to you? 
  [Gilgenberg] I would not want that feeling--of authority. 
The 
work is difficult and thankless, but I will work until we get 
democracy going. 
  [Fomicheva] Here is a question for you from a meticulous 
reader: Are you planning to go to the FRG? It is said that you 
agreed to this position because you want the same kind of 
position in another country. 
  [Gilgenberg] I have relatives in the FRG. They asked me: Are 
you not insane to remain in Russia at such a time? I answered 
that I will only go there when everything is fine in Russia, and 
when it is necessary to help Germany. 
  [Fomicheva] A question from many readers: Why has it become 
so dirty in the city? 
  [Gilgenberg] It would be strange if it were clean, 
considering that the kray administration authorized the rayon 
authorities not to show up for four months at planning meetings 
and conferences in the mayor's office. So, under conditions of 
such anarchy, the city became swamped in garbage. But the 
administration for services and utilities was disbanded back 
during Yefremov's time. We are now restoring it. Relations with 
the sanitary inspection service have also become tense. The 
chief doctor, who did not punish those responsible for the dirty 
conditions, has compiled a protocol against me as the manager. 
But about 200 persons work in this system. I recall a case in 
the former USSR, in the city of Solikamsk: The chief doctor shut 
down plants with injurious wastes. She was summoned to the party 
bureau, a scandal broke out, and the whole country came to the 
defense of the chief doctor, letters were written, telegrams 
sent. You do not investigate such heroes here. No one is fined, 
no appeals are made to the mayor's office. There is no sanitary 
militia. Then at least let the district militia officer look 
after cleanliness together with the yardmen. I think that it 
will be said in any house now that, against the background of 
the fights between the two administrations, the yardmen are 
practically not working. I think that the residents should come 
out in spring and tidy up; after all, they also are littering. 
But I can imagine what the VLADIVOSTOK newspaper will write in 
this regard: "The mayor's office has acknowledged its impotence 
and has decided to summon everyone to volunteer weekend work. 
But, after all, not in one city of the world do residents 
conduct themselves so unwisely. As if it were not their yard, 
home, and street. They do not give a damn, they litter, they 
move on. 
  [Fomicheva] You were the deputy of a kray soviet and enjoyed 
great authority among your voters. I remember that grateful 
letters addressed to you were sent to our newspaper. You have 
experience. What do you think? Will you succeed in leaving the 
old [illegible word] soviet? 
  [Gilgenberg] A Duma of 40 persons also cannot solve all 
problems immediately. However, it is not a matter of the number 
of deputies. At the end of the 1970's I was in the state of 
Vancouver, where the parliament consisted of 200 persons, but 
they all wanted the best for their state. We have a different 
psychology and a habit of constantly living in a fight with one 
another. Beginning with the Pioneers, remember: "In the struggle 
for the cause, be prepared!" Now, everything depends on the 
voters. If they in all seriousness elect worthy people, the Duma 
will be able to change the situation. 
  [Fomicheva] Did you easily collect the signatures for your 
registration as a candidate? 
  [Gilgenberg] Yes. 
  [Fomicheva] But how did you collect them? 
  [Gilgenberg] I do not know, my supporters did this in the 
microrayons. 
  [Fomicheva] Did you use your official position? We have a 
lot 
of letters that talk about such cases in other cities. 
  [Gilgenberg] In no way! 
  [Fomicheva] A commission headed by Nelli Yakimenko from the 
human rights committee came to Vladivostok to look into the 
dispute of the two administrations. Did you meet with it? 
  [Gilgenberg] Of course. I have known Yakimenko for a long 
time: We worked together in the militia, and we joined the 
democratic movement together. But this time I met her as a 
person who was an official from Moscow. She has set herself up 
well in the capital, and the apartment question was resolved. 
But, after all, there have been a lot of commissions, and we 
hope that they will gain an understanding. 
  [Fomicheva] What is it like in the mayor's office now? 
Quiet? 
  [Gilgenberg] Those who came to work along with Cherepkov 
have 
mastered the situation and are working. We are accepting new 
people for a probationary period. 
  [Fomicheva] I wrote once that when we were electing a mayor 
we had a poor idea of what it meant. Are you planning a trip 
abroad for training? 
  [Gilgenberg] This is an interesting question. We are 
planning 
one. Cherepkov's trip to Japan has already fallen through. Now 
he is being invited to Italy. Four employees have been invited 
to Alaska. However, we cannot leave yet, work in the city has 
not been settled. But, then, imagine what we will hear about the 
trips. "They left for a rest," it will be said. 
  [Fomicheva] You will excuse me, but even you have the old 
viewpoint! So, let them say it! In any country a person goes 
where he has a mind to, and it is only in our "camp of 
socialism" that a trip by someone in a managerial position is 
accompanied by "howling" in the newspapers. Previously, this was 
understandable, as they traveled on party money. But now? 
  [Gilgenberg] When we were getting buses from South Korea, I 
wanted to go myself, but I did not allow myself to do so for 
this reason. Although today a trip abroad is really open to 
everyone, and any cooperator has traveled through Turkey, 
France... 
  [Fomicheva] You have always wanted democracy to come, when 
you started the movement for it with Yakimenko. But are you 
living well today? 
  [Gilgenberg] I will answer you like this: The builders of 
both socialism and a society with market relations are one and 
the same. And the methods are old, unfortunately. 
  [Fomicheva] Well, is it good for you or not? 
  [Gilgenberg] There is the hope that it will be good. And I 
think that it is absolutely necessary to retain one principle of 
socialism: A person should not fall below a certain level. And 
it seems that there was a higher morality. 
  [Fomicheva] But this is all in your power as the city 
manager. Perhaps, start with pornography on vendor stands. After 
all, children pass by. Such, excuse me, nonsense is being 
disseminated in many aspects of life where we are smartly trying 
on the garments of foreign life. Without a moment's hesitation. 
But they do not accept pornography there either. What do you 
think of the decision of the State Duma on the amnesty? 
  [Gilgenberg] It seems to me that this question should have 
been decided by lawyers at an international level. I am not very 
pleased that they were all released. But at the same time, in 
periods of crisis, the leadership was completely changed in all 
countries. A younger generation of politicians should normalize 
the situation in Russia. 
  [Fomicheva] And in the kray? Will the two administrations 
reach an agreement? 
  [Gilgenberg] I hope that common sense will prevail among the 
kray leadership. And then Maritime Kray has every chance of 
coming out of the crisis.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Glushkov: "A Personnel Revolution?"] </F>
  [Text] Last Friday, administrations of three rayons 
in Vladivostok were literally shocked by an unexpected 
visit. 
  Early in the morning several persons, led by City 
Administrator V. Gildenberg, showed up in the office of T. 
Vadilyeva, the acting head of Sovetskiy Rayon administration. 
Two of them wore militia uniforms and were armed. After an 
"entertaining" conversation, T. Vadilyeva learned that she had 
been removed from the job, and the new appointee was N. 
Beletskiy, a former head of the city education department and a 
former candidate for a mayor. Our readers may recall that during 
the election campaign he stepped down as a candidate in favor of 
the current head of administration, V. Cherepkov. 
  After that, V. Gildenberg, again with an escort, visited 
Pervomayskiy Rayon, where the head of administration, V. 
Pletnev, was relieved of his duties. His place was taken by V. 
Kalenik, a former deputy chairman of Sovetskiy Rayon Soviet. 
  The same fate befell the head of Leninskiy Rayon 
administration S. Zhurmilov, whose chair will now be occupied by 
D. Ilyinskiy. One can only tell about him that he is 50 and is a 
retired Captain 1st Rank. By the way, S. Zhurmilov did not 
accept his dismissal and filed a court complaint. 
  A strange personnel "reshuffling...." Especially keeping in 
mind that not too long ago the head of the Frunzenskiy Rayon 
administration was replaced--by a militia officer.

<F P=106> [Article by Damir Gaynutdinov under the rubric "The </F>
Authorities and the Press": "Dare Not To Have an Opinion--Vice 
Governor Igor Lebedinets Demanded of our UTRO ROSSII 
Correspondent"] 
  [Text] From now on, esteemed reader, there will be no 
reports from teleconferences of the extraordinary commission for 
kray heat supply, which used to be published on Wednesdays and 
Saturdays under the rubric "Winter Problems." Not because with 
the advent of spring these problems have disappeared overnight. 
It is simply that Igor Petrovich, our chief troubleshooter 
everywhere, forbade me to attend these events from now on. Not 
for the first time, though. 
  Back in December he was very unhappy over the item "Where 
Did 
the Firewood Come From?" in which the author made no secret of 
reports from Khorol officials that because of coal shortages in 
rayon villages, people were chopping down the woods. This was a 
misstep, as the "Cheka" [extraordinary commission] chairman 
explained to me the next time we met. Instead of mobilizing 
people to struggle against adversity, the way it used to be 
during the times of agitation and propaganda and party committee 
press departments, it turns out that I, in Lebedinets' opinion, 
had demoralized the workers. It somehow does not occur to Igor 
Petrovich that only the truth can mobilize people, including the 
kray leadership, toward liquidation of the fuel crisis. The 
Khorol leadership has rung enough alarms by then. 
  The most entertaining part at the time was Igor Petrovich's 
accusation that both I personally and UTRO ROSSII are doing 
everything possible to make things worse... for President 
Yeltsin. I have to confess that sometimes I disagree with the 
actions of Boris Nikolayevich--who during his visit to 
Vladivostok gave his blessing to the publication of our 
newspaper--which should be a normal thing in a law-based state 
and a democratic society. But Igor Petrovich himself developed 
an affinity for Yeltsin only when he ascended to this 
administrative job. As I recall, he had none of that affinity 
during his time in the communist faction of the kray soviet, 
which he headed. 
  Whatever--the result was that he banned me from attending 
the 
conferences then, but later relented after M. Savchenko, 
chairman of the kray administration committee for housing and 
municipal services, said publicly (this is how you discover 
people's mettle even in our democratic times) that I do write 
objectively. 
  On 5 March, however, Mikhail Lvovich sensibly remained 
silent, having decided that to keep trying to educate and teach 
Igor Petrovich is like trying to cure a dead man. Here is what 
happened. 
  Not a single teleconference passes without a reminder of the 
money owed to the energy sector. All the rayons and cities are 
in this debt up to their ears. All of them Igor Petrovich treats 
with benevolence and understanding, however, but as soon as it 
comes to Vladivostok he literally goes into a fit of rage. This 
time what prompted his outburst was that I do not get upset and 
treat Vladivostok like every other place. My especially 
dangerous fault was that I did not write that one of the causes 
of our common shivering this winter was the fact that V. 
Cherepkov allocated money to start the BOLSHOY VLADIVOSTOK 
newspaper. 
  "Why do you not write about that?" the vice governor said, 
looking as if he were spoiling for a fistfight. 
  I explained to him that then I would have to write that 
millions of taxpayer rubles are allocated by the kray 
administration to KRASNOYE ZNAMYA and NOVOSTI, as well as by 
local authorities to all rayon and city newspapers. Is this a 
solution to the heating and power problem? 
  "A demagogue," was the label slapped on me this time. Kray 
party committee ideologist Antokhin once called me a rebel; 
another party secretary, Kharchev, suggested that I decide for 
myself whether I was for the Soviet power or not. It turned out 
that the way he saw it, I was against it. And now another kray 
zealot of propaganda customs, without doubting for a moment... 
  There are many people in the kray who have known both Igor 
Petrovich and myself for many years. Since he got his education 
as a part-time student, I will remind our mutual 
acquaintances--as food for thought--of the meaning of one word. 
  DEMAGOGUERY (demogogia in Greek, from demos--people and 
ago--lead)--deception through intentional distortion of facts, 
false promises, and flattery; hypocritical pandering to the 
taste of the less educated part of the masses in order to 
achieve political goals. 
  I really cannot accept such a characteristic of myself. As 
to 
I. Lebedinets, who calls journalists "slimeballs"--I do not 
know... 
  Watching Igor Petrovich in his capacity as de facto first 
vice governor, I cannot help recalling his namesake and 
predecessor Igor Chernyanskiy. He was rakishly rough, but while 
holding this job he did not stoop to pettiness and 
vindictiveness. 
  "I want to understand, looking from the position of an 
elephant (meaning his job of great responsibility--D.G.) why I 
am being barked at, even if I am not aware of it," he said once. 
  I think it is time for Igor Petrovich to grow to fill this 
job rather than staying in the old position he is accustomed to. 
  Actually, he is not as insignificant as some may think or 
imagine. If I am asked some time in the future who Ye. 
Nazdratenko was, I will say he was Maritime Kray governor during 
Lebedinets' time.

"Conference on Bosnian Conflict Needed"] 
  [Text] The process of reaching a settlement in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina based on the principle of threat of use of force has 
reached an impasse and constitutes the road to nowhere. The NATO 
countries cannot go on threatening air strikes for years on end. 
Nor can the peoples of Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia live under 
such a threat for years on end. Unfortunately, not even having 
begun combat operations, military leaders in the United States 
are already discussing the possibility of their expansion. UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and the NATO leaders have not 
rescinded their threat--they have only postponed it. They are 
not considering that in the event of air strikes in Bosnia, NATO 
and the United Nations will turn into a warring faction. The 
blue helmets will turn dark with blood, and the units wearing 
them will be quickly swept aside by armed forces of Serbs, 
Croats, and Bosnians--which might evoke a responsive reaction 
from the NATO forces. Such a course of events could lead 
inevitably to large-scale war in Europe. 
  It is clear that the peoples of Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, 
and Croatia would be the primary victims of this. It is not 
clear who would compensate for the material damage--many times 
surpassing the scope of humanitarian assistance now being 
extended to Bosnia. 
  Today like never before it is important to prevent 
escalation 
of the conflict in Bosnia into a European tragedy and to deny 
NATO the right to determine when bombing and missile strikes 
will be carried out in Bosnia. It is important that we urgently 
begin to seek new approaches and ideas for achieving a political 
settlement in Bosnia and, on the broader scale, in the Balkans. 
As a minimum such a decision must be made by the UN Security 
Council. It seems that a conference must be convened to this end 
under the aegis of the United Nations to attain a settlement in 
the former Yugoslavia. The initiator of such a conference could 
be Russia and other Slavic states that support even contacts 
with all sides in the Bosnian conflict. Such a conference could 
give all republics of the former Yugoslavia the opportunity to 
participate in it on an equal basis and preclude the possibility 
of a situation arising where decisions would be made behind 
their backs and be imposed on them by outsiders. It is also 
important that all permanent members of the UN Security Council 
participate in the conference. 
  In the event accord is reached with respect to convening 
this 
conference, the preparations group need not be limited to 
international representatives David Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, whose positions reflect the pro-West, pro-NATO 
orientation, but should include representatives from Serbia, 
Montenegro, Croatia, and Bosnia, as well as the ethnic 
minorities of these republics. The group could include Russia, 
Greece--as the neighbor of the Yugoslav republics, and 
Bulgaria--as a Balkan Slavic country. The preparatory work of a 
broad-based group could help convene the international 
conference in a more favorable environment than that in which 
negotiations have thus far been conducted. 
  Conflict in the former Yugoslavia has been ongoing for about 
two years and no end is in sight under the current development 
of events. Conference preparation with participation of the 
Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians themselves should help reduce the 
tension. Negotiations can and must replace military operations. 
  The time has come to establish in Russia the Committee of 
the 
Russian Community To Facilitate a Political Settlement in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, with the participation of representatives of 
political parties, social movements, and Slavic organizations. 
This committee could also facilitate the search for a settlement 
through the establishment of unofficial contacts between 
representatives of the sides in conflict. This too could yield 
great dividends.

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Kandel: "Russian Policy in the Bosnian </F>
Mirror"] 
  [Text] Russia's actions in the recent crisis around 
Sarajevo can be relegated to a number of rare successes from the 
standpoint of diplomatic skill. There was, it is true, a certain 
confusion in the beginning. Indications of this are the 
diplomatic illness that the president "endured on his feet" and 
the statements of various officials that contradicted each 
other, which has already become traditional. But at the 
culminating moment the situation was assessed accurately, the 
weakness and ambiguity in the positions of the other players 
were fully exploited, and the thrust that was created by NATO's 
ultimatum was used to support its own line, which also led to 
the triumph of Russian diplomacy. 
  There is boasting in Moscow about Russia's independent role. 
The obvious irritation in Western capitals with Russian 
"license" is competing with secret satisfaction over the outcome 
of the Sarajevo crisis. Meanwhile, success became possible only 
because all the players, although hardly by agreement, played 
their role in the general game. Using KGB terminology, the West 
played the role of "malicious investigator," after which came 
Russia's turn, to whom it fell, in the person of the "good 
investigator," to reap the fruit. 
  Russia and the Western powers objectively mutually 
complemented each other in their actions, but differed sharply 
in their substantiation. The price of such rhetoric, it would 
seem, is not high. But it always addressees itself to those 
social forces that have a predominant influence on foreign 
policy and, therefore, it is not indifferent to the real driving 
motives of the parties. Russia explained its resistance to 
NATO's ultimatum in a different way: The impermissibility of 
attempts to bypass it, the unacceptability of imposing the model 
of settlement, and the danger of any decision other than a 
continuation of negotiations. But objectively this denoted an 
attempt to lessen international pressure on the Serbian side, 
which was the most powerful and most successful in seizures, and 
which would also reinforce its position behind the negotiating. 
And while at the beginning of the Bosnian conflict Russian 
foreign policy tried, albeit inconsistently, to be impartial, as 
it developed it began to regard "Orthodox co-religionists" and 
"Slavic brothers" with greater and greater favor. This 
corresponded fully to the biased leniency of the European states 
toward Croatia, and of the United States toward the Bosnian 
Muslims. 
  However, the important interests of the Western states are 
not affected here, and only the Bosnian gap in European law and 
order stains their reputation. It is hardly possible to ascribe 
to genuine Russian foreign policy interests an inclination to 
assist the Belgrade regime in a partition of the former SFRY in 
accordance with the ideals of a Greater Serbia. Bosnian rural 
areas are hardly the most effective scene for demonstrating 
greatness. The space, where the collapsed Yugoslav dinar, 
contrary to an anti-German mood, is being squeezed out by the 
German mark, which Russia will be unable to counter with 
anything for a long time, is outside the radius of influence of 
the Russian economy. In precisely the same way a military 
advanced post, separated from it by the territories of Ukraine, 
Moldova, and Romania, is not very suitable for the defense of 
Russia, if the counterproductive task of having a permanent 
irritant on NATO's southern flank is not set. There is also no 
promise of foreign policy dividends in an alliance with an 
international social outcast that contrived to squander the 
enormous foreign policy capital of the former SFRY. 
  Of course, it can be assumed that Russia's readiness to 
support "a Serbian cause" to the last Serbian soldier is 
explained by sober political realism. After all, Serbia, as has 
happened more than once, will remain an "historical ally" of 
Russia only while the war lasts and the international isolation 
continues. It is then in Russia's interests to support this 
status as long as possible. The task is the more gratifying in 
that it does not require any sacrifices by Russia, except for 
damage to its international prestige. But access to the matches 
for the powder keg of Europe is a considerable temptation. The 
intent is sufficiently cynical to appear politically authentic. 
Of course, in this case also, the question of the cost of such a 
temporary "historical alliance" remains. 
  The reality, however, is more transparent. Russian foreign 
policy is more and more becoming a direct derivative of the 
arrangement of internal political forces, taking on a dangerous 
independence from the strictly foreign policy interests and 
objectives of the country. The most authoritarian ruler is 
incapable for long of refuting through his behavior the 
well-known formula of foreign policy being a continuation of 
domestic policy. The exerted striving for foreign policy 
self-affirmation is greater the weaker the domestic stability of 
the existing regime, the narrower its social base and political 
support, and the more dismal its socioeconomic situation. It is 
not just a question of complaisance to the pressure of the 
national-communist opposition that prevails in parliament and to 
the intrigues of the lobbyist groups, from the pro-Serb to the 
Karabakh and Abkhaz groups, which need an example and an 
international-legal precedent to legalize their own claims. It 
is not only a matter of the efforts of the president's "court" 
to forestall the opposition by intercepting some of their 
slogans and the votes of the electorate. For the country as a 
whole, which is obsessed with a complex of greatness but which 
is deprived of many of its status symbols and a material basis, 
there is an inevitable striving to assert an independent role in 
the international arena. 
  The time has also come for a sobering up of Russian foreign 
policy from "romantic Westernism," and just as naturally for a 
departure from "market romanticism." The policy is even more 
pertinent in that such romanticism is principally foreign to the 
West itself. Fraternizing with windmills is just as absurd as 
fighting them. Perhaps it is for this reason that all the 
factions of the State Duma voted for a resolution that denounces 
NATO's ultimatum. However, the age-old misfortune of the Russian 
character--dislike for the middle ground--turns into a tragic 
shortfall in the policy of the centrist social and political 
forces. Therefore, there is a very great risk that "market 
romanticism," given the most insignificant changes in the 
composition of the leading personalities, will be replaced by an 
antimarket romance, and that illusory Westernism will turn into 
great power illusions. The magical transformation of Kozyrev's 
Stockholm parody into a Russian foreign policy program is a 
dangerous symptom of precisely such an evolution. It is entirely 
superfluous to talk about the foreign policy constructions of 
the national-communist opposition. 
  The Sarajevo crisis revealed latent maturing processes of 
changes in Russian foreign policy. This may become the guarantee 
of more businesslike relations of Russia with Western 
states--proof of the fact that not only is the West necessary to 
Russia, but that Russia is also necessary to the West. The 
Sarajevo crisis can also turn out to be the start of a new 
opposition. But while Russia cannot escape a serious discussion 
with the Western partners, for example, as a result of their 
attempts to counteract the voluntary reintegration of the 
post-Soviet space, to quarrel regarding Bosnia is pure 
childishness. But the president and his circle are hardly ready 
to be at loggerheads with the State Duma over this. It is 
because what is happening there in fact makes no difference to 
one or the other. After all, Russian foreign policy, to Russian 
politicians of various colors, is only a place for settling 
domestic political scores.

<F P=106> ["Viewpoint" article by Karen Brutents, doctor of historical </F>
sciences and adviser to the president of the Political Studies 
Foundation: "Russia and the East"] 
  [Text] Russia is in transition in almost every respect. 
This also goes for the crystallisation of its identity as 
regards both its rightful role in the world community and its 
concept of its own distinctiveness and essence. I take the view 
that in this respect as in some others Russia still keeps in 
large measure to the past, to disconnected fragments of it, and 
may be said to apply the formula of its legal succession to this 
sphere as well. 
  Yet Russia will have to "predetermine itself," with its 
vision of the problems of "Russia and the East," of relations 
with the East, as a most important part of the process. 
  What is the issue today, when the substance of a problem 
that 
seems so very traditional or rather historical for the country 
is undergoing a serious transformation as a result of 70 years 
of membership in the Soviet Union and, above all, drastic 
geostrategic, social, and economic changes in Russia? 
  It is primarily our relations with Eastern (in fact Asian) 
countries as well as their projection into our relations with 
the West. Until recently this part of the globe received little 
attention from Russian policy and diplomacy for both objective 
and subjective reasons. But Boris Yeltsin's visit to South 
Korea, China, India and Japan, his remarks in Peking about 
"breakthroughs" to Asia and in Delhi about a "period of 
pro-Eastern policy" give hope for serious reassessment, for a 
continuation of the process of revision, with tangible deeds 
following important statements. 
  The attitude to the East and relations with it are a key 
aspect of Russia's identity, of its self-determination as a 
civilised spiritual, psychological and even political 
phenomenon. Whether Russia belongs to or sees itself as part of 
the West or the East was the object of a controversy that ran 
through Russian social thought for a long time, being slightly 
diluted in the 1920s by emigres who advanced the concept of 
Eurasianism. Nor is this surprising, for the controversy has 
always involved diametrically opposed political notions of the 
road along which Russia should move. 
  It seems to me, however, that this aspect of the controversy 
has lost meaning (assuming that it ever had any), and the 
present flare-up of Eurasianism is rather indicative of the 
opposition's search for ideological equipment and its reaction 
to immoderate (and occasionally indecent) Westernisation on the 
part of a section of the intelligentsia and some spokesman for 
the government. Be that as it may, the formula of Westernisers 
versus Eurasianists and those who consider themselves 
inseparable from Russia's "native soil" provides no answer to 
the question of the relationship between Russia and the East. 
  The issue today is obviously Russia's fundamental attitude 
to 
the East, the need to recall certain distinguishing 
characteristics of our country, not a reproduction of theses of 
Eurasianism, which argues that Russia is following a road of its 
own and that regular global developments do not apply to it. The 
experience gained to date leaves no room for doubt that they 
involve the East, West, North and South. Hence Russia cannot 
stay off the road of democracy and a social market economy, 
whose various forms are winning ever wider recognition. 
  This, however, presupposes realising that the long-standing 
notion of the "ownership" of the phenomenon of democracy is 
outdated and that to embark on democracy is not the same as 
accepting the Western model. 
  The vitality of democracy depends on its ability to make 
further progress. Currently, many in the West are pondering on 
how to improve the democratic procedure in use. More and more 
people there consider that these procedures are by no means 
ideal and that it is indispensable to devise effective ways of 
combating increasing corruption, overcoming the population's 
political indifference due to the crisis of the party system in 
its present form and to the disregard of pressing needs of the 
electorate by leaders, to their selfishness and demagoguery of 
defending the interests and rights of minorities from the 
democratic diktat of the majority. In this situation the search 
for consensus which is typical of Eastern countries seems to be 
coming to the fore in various sections and structures of society. 
  The 21st century is likely to become an era of 
democratisation in the East. But this will hardly come down to a 
mere transplantation of the Western model and hence to 
Westernisation. Incidentally, all talk about grafting Western 
ideals is indefensible also tactically. It may complicate the 
democratisation process, causing this "extraneous" phenomenon to 
be rejected, a prospect exploited by nationalist and oligarchic 
forces in the East. Formerly, in the period of confrontation 
between two world systems, there certainly was a point in 
stressing the "Western" character of democracy. Today, however, 
the situation is entirely different. 
  Russia largely owes its originality (but not exclusiveness) 
and its legitimate role and potential as a member of the world 
community to the fact that it combines, if not always 
harmoniously, the features of Western (European) and Asian 
(Eastern) civilisations. While the poet Alexander Blok used 
those famous words "Yes, we are Scythians, yes, we are Asians" 
in the heat of debate, they were not accidental but reflected a 
historic intertwining. 
  Traditionally drawn primarily to the West, Russia has always 
been a Eurasian country nonetheless, and this not only 
territorially. Its history, polyethnic environment, culture and 
very interests induced it to play the role of a link or even 
mediator between the two countries. Of course, how far it coped 
with this role is open to question. But there is no doubt that 
over the centuries diverse civilisational streams converged in 
the expanses of Russia, where a polyphonic socio-cultural area, 
a fabric of intercivilisational bonds and a culture of mutually 
enriching interchanges came into being and an atmosphere of 
psychological tolerance and openness to beneficial influences 
was created. 
  Everything relating to Russian nationals--their way of life, 
individual and social psychology, arts and letters, character 
and mentality--bear the imprint of this intercivilisational and 
supranational phenomenon influencing also the political 
evolution of the country, if not decisively. The 
"non-Westernness" of many spiritual and moral qualities of 
ethnic Russians and other inhabitants of Russia is obvious. 
  Directly deducing the specifics of Russia and its people 
from 
contacts with the foreign and internal parts of the East or from 
the "Eastern" component of their "soul" is out of the question, 
for they are a product of more complex interaction. 
  Still, the influence of these contacts, of Russia's Eastern 
environment, seems indisputable. Traces of it can be found in 
the language, the humanities (meaning their scope and the range 
of their interests), literature, noblemen's names and much else. 
This is as it should be, for, apart from two and a half 
centuries of the Mongol domination, Russia continuously and 
intensively extended its contact with the East through conquest 
and cultural interpenetration. It grew into Asia, forming its 
own East, an Asia of its own, where hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Russians and other Russian nationals closely interacted 
psychologically, intellectually, and emotionally with the 
Eastern way of life and Eastern culture. 
  No non-Asian country has anything like this, and the 
spiritual reverberations of this interaction were bound to make 
themselves felt in one way or another throughout Russia. How 
very tangible the results of this mutual receptiveness can be is 
illustrated by the problem of adaptation of today's wave of 
emigration from some southern republics. It appears that there 
is a substantial distinction in psychology and way of life 
between these emigrants and their compatriots in, say, Central 
Russia, which creates difficulties in this respect as well. 
  A high degree of tolerance for a polytechnic environment is 
a 
further reflection of Russia's historic identity, of the blend 
of Western and Eastern components that its genetic type 
represents. To be sure, Russian chronicles have also recorded 
other things. Chauvinism, too, has had and still has influential 
adherents. By and large, however, Russia as a country and 
society is more resistant--as the dramatic experience of recent 
years shows--to anti-emigration trends like those that are now 
rife in, for example, Western Europe. 
  Russia's attitude to the East is an attitude to itself, too, 
for Russia is also home to Tatars, Bashkirs, Yakuts, Caucasian, 
and dozens of other "Eastern" nationalities. Their place in our 
country, in its life and fortunes, is entirely different from 
that of, say, Arabs or Africans in France, Indians or Pakistanis 
in Britain. Russia is not just a habitat of diverse ethnic 
groups but a polytechnic country where the Russians as its 
backbone and other peoples have for centuries lived not only 
side by side but together, intermingling, fusing culturally and 
spiritually, jointly weathering social cataclysms and repulsing 
foreign invasions. They have a common history and common destiny. 
  Add to this that for 70 years we lived in one state, leading 
a common life with millions of Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kirghiz, 
Turkmens, Tajiks, Azerbaijanians, and that today we belong with 
them to the Commonwealth of Independent States. All this was 
bound to and did have its effect, drawing and linking us 
together. 
  In other words, whereas Western Europe and the United States 
may look on the East as something different or even alien, it 
would be unnatural of Russia to do so. This is what geography 
and history, cultural and civilisational factors have willed. 
  Some Russian leaders today repudiate Russia's "Asian 
heritage," seeing nothing in it but negative, ignominious 
things, a burden pulling us back. Yet this heritage is as 
contradictory as any other legacy of history. Along with 
elements of medieval stagnation and even slavery, it includes 
what is a natural part of the historic strength and potential of 
Russia and its civilisation. 
  Russia belongs to neither the West nor the East alone. It is 
at once a Western and Eastern country. This does not mean that 
Russia is a mix or mechanical combination of cultural 
continents. Our country is the product of a synthesis that has 
given rise to a new, distinctive civilisation, a whole 
civilisational mainland, an original organism whose thinking and 
sentiments set it apart from others. And so all attempts to 
"rid" us of things Eastern and fully Westernise us are futile. 
What is more, they are absurd. 
  Today the multicivilisational, Western and Eastern sources 
and nature of Russian distinctiveness are acquiring special 
value. "Integration" is a word you now hear almost everywhere. 
It is a trend paving the way to the future for humanity. A 
universal civilisation is dawning all over the world, and its 
components are taking shape and spreading, especially to the 
economic sphere but also to politics and culture. 
  Much less is said, however, about the circumstances that the 
result will by no means be a unified world, the effacement of 
distinctions, the abolition of cultural diversity. If this were 
to happen, humanity would become faceless, for it would lose one 
of the most powerful driving forces of its progress. 
  I am sure the 21st century will give existing civilisations 
a 
second wind as they develop and adapt to new conditions without 
losing their identity. It will usher in an increasingly 
polycentric world. We will arrive at it after abolishing a 
bipolar system, as we have already done, and completing the 
present transitional stage of unbalanced concentration of 
political influence, military power, and information potential 
at one pole. 
  Unlike the past, however, the evolution of diverse 
civilisations will probably take place in unprecedentedly close 
mutual contact. The era of isolated civilisations shutting out 
all others is over. They are being drawn together by the 
transnationalisation of economic life and information, the 
feverish development of communications, mass migrations. This 
creates tensions at "junctions" and other difficulties. 
Experience shows that even the achievement of a high, roughly 
equal level of economic growth does not eliminate problems 
arising from civilisational and cultural heterogeneity. 
  We live at a time when not only close contacts and a 
rapprochement between countries and nations but a convergence of 
civilisations and cultures are gaining in importance and 
urgency. This is all the more essential now that the greatest 
ideological conflict of the 20th century is over. Against this 
background Russia with its mixed civilisation, a country which 
has gone through a social experiment, is a particularly 
noteworthy phenomenon. Its intercivilisational essence, the 
experience of the coexistence of and contacts between diverse 
nations, may prove very valuable for humanity at this stage if 
preserved and fostered. 
  The East always held a prominent place in the foreign policy 
and overall potential of the Russian state and the Soviet Union. 
Basically, this also applies to the present period even though a 
number of important circumstances and vectors have changed, 
which means that many earlier approaches will have to be 
revised. What is different now is primarily Russia's real status. 
  Russia used to identify itself with a superpower, the Soviet 
Union, and actually embodied it. The Soviet Union was chiefly a 
Russian state. Most foreigners called it "Russia" and its 
citizens "Russians," doing so not only by mistake or force of 
habit. 
  Today Russia is striving to act as a full-fledged legal 
successor of the Soviet Union, and Russian diplomacy is doing as 
much in the main sectors. Yet the changes that set in with the 
disappearance of the Soviet Union as a superpower strongly 
affected Russia even though it may still not quite realise its 
new situation because the aura of the recent past and reflexes 
of a state that has gone out of existence linger on. Russia has 
joined the ranks of great powers (with a population half the 
size of the Soviet Union's and an area that is smaller by a 
third) and will yet have to back up this new status by providing 
itself with an appropriate economic and political basis. 
  The priorities and main tasks of Russian policy and 
diplomacy 
are not quite clear as yet. They are certain to depend for some 
time to come on personal predilections, reflexes of attraction 
and rejection, automatic reactions evolved over the past few 
years. But however pro-American and pro-European a section of 
the intelligentsia and some leaders of the country may be (they 
understandably want Russia to be regarded as inseparable from 
Europe and the West and to have a say in European affairs), 
there is no disregarding realities. 
  The disintegration of the Soviet Union has objectively 
shifted the geostrategic and geopolitical epicentre of Russia to 
the East, towards Asia, although nominally this is not the case 
and, more importantly, is somewhat contrary to our current 
requirements. A belt of new independent states has emerged to 
the west of Russia (Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, the Baltia 
republics) drawn mainly to Western Europe, not Russia. These 
states are virtually moving Russia away from Europe, being a 
partition that may become a barrier where the position on Russia 
is unfriendly. On its southern periphery Russia is now faced 
with independent Transcaucasian and Central Asian states plus 
Kazakhstan. Furthermore, some of them are becoming a serious 
security problem. 
  Today Asia accounts for nearly 80 percent of Russia's 
territory, 70 percent of its frontiers and the lion's share of 
its natural resources. What the country can expect to help it 
end the present economic deadlock and make progress are 
primarily its eastern areas. Siberia and the Far East (12 
million square kilometres of territory and the longest Pacific 
coastline), their economic cooperation with and integration into 
the fast-developing Asia-Pacific region. 
  As matters stand, the Asian part of Russia is thus bound to 
play a bigger role in the destiny of the country, its economic 
growth and foreign policy. This is also true of its Far Eastern 
coast at a time when most of the country's Baltic and Black Sea 
ports are gone. 
  A welcome change is the fact that Russia is no longer 
shackled by a superpower policy involving overarmament and 
ideological messianism and demanding that the country approach 
the world as the arena of an all-out rivalry for leadership. 
Russia no longer sees the East as an area of confrontation 
between two systems. It has withdrawn from an unacceptable and 
unwinnable game. 
  I believe all this means that Russia must resist the 
temptation of a duumvirate approach that, while possibly 
tickling its self-esteem, is useless. Besides, the United States 
remembers Russia in this context mostly when it is a question of 
certain survivals of the Cold War, an attitude which is only 
natural from the point of view of that country's national 
interests. 
  Russia's most powerful neighbours are in the East--in Asia. 
Its relations with the East include relations with China. These 
are already of fundamental importance and their importance for 
Russia's destiny will grow further in the first decade of the 
next century, when China will have a real chance to become an 
economic (and possibly also a military) superpower, according to 
many forecasts.
