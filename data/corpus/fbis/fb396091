drafted by Prof. V. Pylypchuk, Ukraine people's deputy] 
  [Text] 
  1. To stop inflation: 
  1.1 to close the budget deficit by means of: 
  a) increasing revenues by means of: 
  --abolishing all tax relief to all enterprises except ones 
employing the handicapped; 
  --reducing tax rates to stimulate economic activity; 
  --shifting to taxing prices (sales turnover), thus 
eliminating the cause of revenue shortfalls due to corruption; 
  --and, implementing mass privatization, which will raise 
budget revenues. 
  b) Reducing budgetary outlays by means of: 
  --ending financing of capital investment by enterprises; 
  --liquidating industry management entities and their 
managerial structures at enterprises (reducing expenditures on 
management); 
  --and, limiting migration to Ukraine by retirees from other 
countries. 
  1.2. To close the foreign trade deficit. 
  a) To increase exports by means of: 
  --abolishing export licensing; 
  --reducing export tariffs; 
  --and, putting an end to mass uncontrolled smuggling of 
goods 
out of Ukraine, stimulating the development of export potential. 
  b) To reduce imports by means of: 
  --restructuring the existing Ukrainian industrial complex to 
produce import substitutions and reduce the dependence of the 
Ukrainian economy on traditional suppliers; --attracting foreign 
investors with tenders for the production of import 
substitutions; --diversifying and converting enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex; --increasing protectionism in 
nonessential imports; --implementing competitive sale of 
convertible currency for essential imports; --shifting from 
centralized distribution and sale to sale and distribution using 
free market structures; --dissolving the discriminatory 
agreement with Russia whereby Ukraine bears the responsibility 
for the debt incurred by Ukrainian businessmen to Russian ones, 
while Russia bears no such responsibility; --introducing a 
system of import preferences for raw materials and advanced 
technology; --intensifying the exploitation of old, and 
exploration for new, deposits of oil and gas (as well as other 
resources); -- 
  --and, developing alternative types and sources of energy. 
  1.3. To eliminate the imbalance in the supply of goods and 
money on the Ukrainian market. 
  a) To increase the supply of goods and property, by means 
of: 
  --turning factories, plants, stores, land and housing into 
salable property; --increasing the stimulus for raising the 
production of goods and services by privatization; --conducting 
industry-based tenders for foreign investors (in the course of 
privatization) to produce goods which are in short supply in 
Ukraine; --and, effecting liberalization. 
  b) To reduce an inflation-producing monetary overhang, by 
means of: 
  --banning the National Bank of Ukraine from issuing 
unsupported (product-less) currency; --banning the National Bank 
of Ukraine from selling commercial banks reserves as credit 
resources; --banning commercial banks from issuing loans to 
loss-making companies; --ensuring positive borrowing rates 
(credit policy); --banning the Finance Ministry from 
deficit-funding government expenditures; --raising the velocity 
of money; --adopting the practice of seeking guarantees from 
foreign parties for payments to Ukrainian exporters; 
--abolishing state orders for foreign purchases; --and, 
establishing a system of economic sanctions for the sale of 
Ukrainian goods abroad at dumping prices. 
  To implement monetary reform when inflation is stopped. 
  2. The introduction of the hryvnya 
  2.1. Before the hryvnya is introduced, a stabilization fund 
should be created, to consist of: 
  --hard currency revenues from the sale, by international 
tender, of unfinished construction projects (based on the state 
privatization program); --short-term hard-currency loans from 
the population (for the period of 2-to-5 months); --assistance 
from the International Monetary Fund; --and, golds and precious 
stones mined in Ukraine. 
  2.2. To build capacities in Ukraine for: 
  --stamping coins, printing money and producing special paper 
and ink. 
  2.3. To introduce the hryvnya at the start of mass 
privatization. 
  3. Privatization. 
  3.1. To implement privatization in a very short time period 
by subscription to stocks and property through a single computer 
network and a unified data bank, which will ensure that: 
  --privatization is not an uncontrolled grab for property; 
--corruption is eliminated from the entire process; --all 
citizens of Ukraine have equal access to property, independent 
of location of the property or place of residence; --due to 
cross-ownership among east and west and north and south, 
separatist tendencies are reduced and interethnic tension 
diminished; --investment is attracted along with privatization; 
--citizens are compensated for the loss of the purchasing power 
of money stemming from inflation (by payment in kind); --the 
privatization process is quickly completed, thus improving 
stimuli for better work; --citizens' social security is taken 
care of (with the distribution of property), giving them an 
opportunity to enrich themselves and the state; --the high level 
of exploitation and one of the main sources of inflation is 
liquidated, which is connected to the gap between labor input 
(or produced output) and wages (at private and stock companies 
salaries are considerably higher than at state enterprises); 
--and, at the same time, the responsibility of all workers for 
satisfying consumer demand for goods and services is increased. 
  4. Division of power and responsibility at different 
levels of power. 
  4.1. The central government will retain the responsibility 
for: 
  --international relations, macroeconomic policy, defense, 
basic scientific research and control over the implementation of 
the constitution and the laws. 
  4.2. The regions will retain the responsibility for: 
  --local economy and protection of civil order. 
  4.3. The regions and the central government will bear joint 
responsibility for: 
  --education, culture, health care and environmental 
protection. 
  4.4. The enterprises will have the responsibility for: 
  --applied research; 
  --creation of national income; improving efficiency of 
economic activity; 
  -- competition and bankruptcy; analysis and forecasts of 
market conditions; 
  -- independent creation of domestic and foreign economic 
ties, prices, range of products and services they intend to 
provide and disposition of profits as well as forms, methods and 
level of wages (total freedom of enterprise); 
  -- and, the environment. 
  4.5. Budgets and revenue base will be distributed in 
accordance to articles 4.1. to 4.4. (budgetary independence). 
  4.6. The regions will be subordinate, accountable and 
responsible to the central authority in areas which are funded 
from the general state budget, in issues of upholding Ukrainian 
laws and in the implementation of reforms. 
  4.7. While balance in relations between them is being 
reformed, mutual support by the legislative and executive power 
should be bolstered by means of: 
  a) limiting the authority of the President of Ukraine to the 
functions of the head of state; 
  b) the President of Ukraine has the responsibility of 
appointing the Prime Minister, with the consent of parliament; 
  c) after its nomination by the Prime Minister, the entire 
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine is to be confirmed by the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine; 
  d) if a government resigns, the Supreme Council will 
immediately suspend its own authority (new elections). This 
clause will increase the responsibility of the Ukraine Supreme 
Council both for nominating the Cabinet of Ministers and for 
cooperating with it (for the state of affairs in the 
government). Local authorities will function similarly. 
  5. To ensure reliable social security for the 
population. 
  5.1. For the pensioners: 
  --by providing pensions equal to 70 percent of workers' 
wages; stopping migration to Ukraine by pensioners who are not 
Ukraine citizens; and, providing special assistance to the 
handicapped and the poor. 
  5.2. For large families (poor), to provide child assistance 
in kind to bring them up to the poverty level. 
  5.3. To eliminate the negative consequences of the rise in 
unemployment (beyond the existing system of payments to the 
unemployed): 
  a) to eliminate absolute unemployment (when the number of 
existing jobs is smaller than the number of people in the 
workforce), by means of: 
  --first, extending maternity leave for mothers until the 
child reaches the age of up to six years. In this case, all 
budgetary expenditures on preschool care should be passed on to 
mothers. This approach will help achieve other social goals: the 
child will get more education and care in the family; --family 
upbringing and care will reduce disease, improve moral aspects 
of child rearing and strengthen ties and mutual understanding 
between children and parents; 
  --second, increasing the number of jobs for underemployed 
professions using funds from the budget; --and, third, 
establishing and developing market infrastructure by 
transforming unemployed collectives into marketing and 
monitoring services, market study groups, brokerage houses, 
banks, etc.; 
  b) to eliminate relative unemployment (if in the country 
overall the number of jobs is greater than the number of people 
in the workforce): 
  --regional unemployment (in cases when unemployment exists 
in 
one region while another suffers from a labor shortage) will be 
eliminated by means of an accelerated privatization of housing 
and creation of a housing market. In this case, the unemployed 
will be able to sell their housing in the region where there is 
unemployment and buy it where there is a labor shortage. This 
approach does not require budgetary expenditures; --skills and 
professions-related unemployment (in cases when a region has job 
vacancies but job requirements call for different skills or 
professional qualifications than those possessed by the local 
unemployed) can be eliminated with the help of budget funds (an 
unemployment fund) and funds from enterprises, by providing 
professional retraining for the unemployed. In this area, 
organizational work will be provided by the Ukraine employment 
service, once it gets the necessary authority. 
  5.4. To repay domestic debts to Ukraine citizens. 
  a) To compensate citizens for the loss of value of their 
savings by means of: 
  --transferring state property in the course of 
privatization, 
with the help of privatization certificates, and indexing 
average annual account balances and using them as funds for 
privatization. 
  b) To repay USSR state obligations, by means of: 
  --exchanging them for Ukrainian state debt (when it is 
issued); --indexing the obligations and transforming them into 
possible means of payment in privatization; --and, in the next 
four years, repaying in cash the indexed value of the 
obligations to those citizens who decide not to use them as a 
means of payment in privatization. 
  c) To repay winning claims in cash and property lotteries of 
the former USSR, by means of: 
  --repaying monetary prizes in the course of four years, 
based 
on the actual value of property that has been won. 
  5.5. While implementing reforms, to ensure their social 
orientation in the following areas: 
  --income growth; --increase in the living standard; 
--opportunities for family vacations, including also abroad; 
--protection for economic interests of individuals; --social 
security for individuals; --protection for the family; 
--inviolate right to housing and other property; --reduction of 
the fiscal responsibility of the state for individuals and 
businesses; --development of the paternalistic concern for 
workers on the part of enterprises; --freedom to choose 
employment and to dispose of property; --and, environmental 
protection. 
  6. Reform of the agricultural sector. 
  6.1.1. To divide productive land into three categories. 
  6.1. Reform of land property rights should be carried out 
based on the following division: 
  --first, land that lies fallow (where kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes 
have been dissolved) or where there is no productive population; 
--second, land that belongs to functioning kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes which have no hope of repaying their debts; --and, 
third, land that belongs to economically viable kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes. 
  a) Land of the first category should be leased to everyone 
who is willing to become a farmer, for a period of five years. 
If in five years they become efficient producers, their land 
will be given to them free of charge, as their property. If they 
are unable to obtain projected yields for the crops that they 
cultivate (productive exploitation), they would be able to 
purchase that land or it would be leased to others for the 
period of five years; 
  b) kolkhozes and sovkhozes functioning on land of the second 
category should be offered to divide their land and property, so 
that those who wish could leave them and become independent 
farmers. Other kolkhoz members could use their shares to set up 
cooperatives, collective farms or proprietor and shareholder 
associations. If members of a kolkhoz agree to this type of 
reform, the state will assume (write off) its hopeless debts. If 
they do not, such kolkhozes will be declared bankrupt and their 
property will be leased to those who wish to become independent 
farmers (in accordance to the process described in Article 
6.1.a.); 
  c) collective farms functioning on land of the third 
category 
will not be reformed or reformed only with the consent of their 
labor collectives (to prevent the repetition of the mistakes of 
1930-33, when strong farms and farmers, those who fed the 
country, were liquidated). However, all agricultural management 
entities will be eliminated (RAPO, OAPO and others), and 
agricultural workers will become entirely free and independent 
in their economic activity. After reform, land owners will 
decide themselves, in the conditions of a free market and 
competition, what is the best form of organization for 
agricultural production: some farmers will join together and 
perhaps some kolkhozes will split up (of those belonging to the 
third category of land), but it will be as the result of the 
natural choice and needs of the owners themselves. 
  6.1.2. Diversification of farm activities. 
  It is a known fact that underdeveloped nations sell raw 
materials and not finished goods. The same is true in farming. 
For example, in November 1993 the state bought 1 kilo of meat 
for K9,000 and sold 1 kilo of sausage (made of 2 kilos of meat) 
for K100,000. 
  We propose: 
  a) in 1994, at the initial stage of reform, to instruct the 
processing industry to pay for processing agricultural raw 
materials with a share (of up to 25 percent) of finished output. 
(So that up to 75 percent of prepared sausage, butter, sugar, 
etc. will revert to agricultural enterprises. By selling 
finished products, agricultural workers will considerably 
improve the financial health of their farms.) 
  b) To order from the military-industrial complex (where 
capacities remain idle) a required quantity of small-scale but 
fully automated meat processing, butter producing, cheese 
making, vegetable preserving (canning) and baking plants which 
would be built on the countryside. To transfer (or auction) some 
stores to the agricultural sector. In this case, all the profits 
which today accrue to purchasing, transportation and processing 
entities, as well as wholesale and retail trade, will go to 
producers not of meat and corn, but of finished products (i.e., 
sausage, butter, etc.) on the countryside. In this case, workers 
on the countryside will no longer need subsidies: their farms 
will be highly profitable. 
  c) Financial assistance for the countryside. 
  Existing countryside subsidies in the budget should be 
retained, for the following purposes: 
  --to order fully automated plants for the processing of 
vegetable and animal products (for the time period necessary to 
the countryside to build up its own processing base); --for the 
purchase of agricultural machinery for newly created farms (for 
a period of one year); --for the purchase of mineral fertilizers 
and means of chemical protection of crops (herbicides, 
defoliants, insecticides, etc.) for a period of two years 
following reform; --subsequently, financial subsidies would be 
redirected to the development of the social infrastructure. 
  d) To develop full and wasteless processing of agricultural 
products on the countryside: 
  --feathers, hides, horns, hooves, etc., with the goal of 
improving the efficiency of production. 
  7. To safeguard economic security of Ukraine by means 
of: 
  --diversifying the supplier base; --diversifying markets for 
Ukrainian output; --diversifying entities involved in foreign 
business activity; --diversifying functions of enterprise; 
--building up state supplies and reserves; --freeing up 
enterprise; --reorienting domestic production toward import 
substitution; --adopting protectionist policies; --intensifying 
exploration of domestic deposits, including also of energy 
sources; --developing energy production using domestic sources; 
--introducing new, alternative sources of energy; --developing 
export potential of Ukraine; --de-monopolizing the economy and 
encouraging competition; --stabilizing the monetary system and 
introducing currency convertibility; --banning the sale of 
Ukrainian territory; --improving the living standard of the 
population by means of reform; --the banking system; --business 
relations; --the payment system; --state economic regulation; 
--and, development of property market infrastructure. 
  8. Economic management in the state sector. 
  8.1. a) The enterprise manager in the state sector of the 
economy will be hired on a contract basis and is the only and 
plenipotentiary representative of the state (as the owner of the 
property) at the enterprise. He organizes the work of the 
enterprise within the limits of, and based on, existing laws of 
Ukraine; --contract provisions and conditions set by the state 
property fund. 
  Within the constraints set by contract provisions and 
conditions set by the state property fund, the manager bears 
sole and personal responsibility before the Ministry of the 
State Sector of the Economy. 
  b) The manager hires all enterprise employees on a contract 
basis and can fire any of them for violating contract provisions 
or based on a court decision. 
  c) The following indicators of efficiency of the use of 
state 
property will be used: 
  --productivity growth rate; --growth rate for return on 
capital; --growth rate for competitive output production; 
--relationship between growth rates of the salary fund and of 
output, in comparable prices; --indicators of reorientation of 
the Ukrainian economy; --import-export balance; --share of 
output sold domestically in Ukraine. 
  8.1.2. The Ministry of the State Sector of the Economy has 
no 
right to: 
  --establish managerial superstructures over the enterprise; 
--require the manager to provide any information, excluding 
specified statistical data; --insist on the implementation of 
any orders relating to the economic and financial, business or 
scientific and technological activities of the enterprise; 
--change conditions of the contract with the manager; --remove 
the manager if he carries out contract provisions, if the 
enterprise conforms to established indicators and if the 
activities of the manager and the enterprise are in accordance 
with existing laws and fulfill the requirements of the state 
property fund, based on specified conditions. 
  8.1.3. The state property fund determines for the manager: 
  --the share of the property that can be used as a 
collateral. 
Agreements which exceed the share limit set by the fund are 
declared null and void at the time of their signing; --and, 
targets for privatizing enterprise property. 
  8.1.4. In connection with the transfer to the Ukraine 
Cabinet 
of Minister of responsibility for managing the property of the 
state, to create the Ukraine Ministry of the State Sector of the 
Economy, the main functions of which will be: 
  --to establish, reorganize and liquidate state enterprises 
and to approve their statutes; --to hire and remove enterprise 
managers, in accordance with Ukraine laws and contract 
provisions; --and, to organize the implementation of planned 
annual inspections of enterprise financial and economic 
activities in order to exercise control over effective use of 
state property. Inspections may not exceed 20 calendar days. 
  8.1.5. In every enterprise, a supervisory committee will be 
established, comprised of three persons drawn from its 
employees, who will function as representatives of, and will be 
appointed by: 
  --the Ukraine Ministry of Finance, the state property fund 
and the Ministry of the State Sector of the Economy. 
  The supervisory committee at every enterprise will be set up 
by the joint decision of the above-mentioned organizations. 
Members of the supervisory committee can function as such at 
several other enterprises (excepting competing enterprises). 
  Members of the supervisory committee must be appraised of 
all 
contracts of the enterprise, instructions from the manager and 
financial documents; --they will supervise compliance with laws 
and contract provisions and analyze the effectiveness of the 
utilization of property in accordance with the established 
indicators. When violations are uncovered, they will be 
obligated to report them to those organizations that have 
appointed them. Members of the supervisory committee will not be 
allowed to ask for information from the manager and other 
enterprise executives or demand explanations from them, but will 
be able to submit requests for additional information. Members 
of the supervisory committee will not have the right to give 
orders to the manager and enterprise employees, but can provide 
optional advice. 
  Members of the supervisory committee will not be allowed to 
divulge, orally or in writing, any information which concerns 
any aspects of enterprise activities, expect to the 
organizations by which they have been appointed. Those guilty of 
disclosure of information will be prosecuted. 
  8.2 Macroeconomic regulation. 
  8.2.1. Activities in the economic area will be divided as 
follows: 
  a) the state will not intrude in any way in the business and 
financial activity of enterprises (state no more than private 
ones). The state will not be involved in trade (either domestic 
or foreign). Those functions will be fully transferred to 
enterprises. 
  b) The state will influence the economic situation in the 
country only by interest rate, credit, exchange rate and 
monetary policies, reserve requirements, tax rates and 
protectionist policy, as well as by means of quotas, preferences 
and sanctions.

<F P=106> [Article by the Expert-Analysis Department of the Joint </F>
Stock Company "Kinto": "Only Financial Intermediaries Are 
Capable of Getting `Voucher' Privatization Moving in Ukraine: 
This Is What the Experts of the Trust Association `Kinto-Trust' 
Think"] 
  [Text] Recently in certain mass media organs, an ugly 
campaign has appeared concerning the trust associations which 
perform services in the distribution of privatization funds for 
the population. Today, we present the thinking of experts on the 
matter of the privatization funds. 
  Ukraine is not the first country to take the path of 
privatization, in which privatization documents are used to pay 
for objects of privatization -- in our case, privatization 
property certificates. And even though in each of these 
countries, the processes of privatization have their own 
national specifics, one thing, certainly, is shared: the very 
broad participation of financial intermediaries in them -- 
investment funds, trust associations, and the like. Thus, 
two-thirds of the citizens of the Czech Republic and Slovakia 
have used the services of investment privatization funds in the 
distribution of their privatization funds, and investment funds 
in Russia have already collected more than half of all vouchers. 
  Perhaps one of the main reasons why privatization, 
especially 
"voucher" privatization, is going so slowly in Ukraine, has been 
the absence of institutions capable of giving the population 
qualified help in the distribution of privatization funds. Today 
in Ukraine, only one percent of the population has used its 
right to obtain privatization documents and invest them in 
objects of privatization. The majority has invested in the 
enterprise in which they work. However, significant categories 
of citizens are deprived of this possibility. They are forced to 
seek, independently, objects for the investment of privatization 
funds, and to resolve on their own all questions connected with 
the exchange of property certificates for the stock of a given 
enterprise. Anyone who has made such attempts knows how complex 
this procedure is, considering the mechanism for the use of 
privatization funds that exists in Ukraine. Moreover, the 
problem of choosing an enterprise is complex enough in 
circumstances of an almost complete information vacuum. 
  The awarding of licenses by the Fund for Ukrainian State 
Property for work with the privatization funds of the population 
to the trust associations (in Kiev, "Kinto-Trust" was the first 
to work with them) has, at last, made it possible for most of 
the population quickly and effectively to use the right of every 
citizen of Ukraine to privatization funds. What are the 
advantages given by the transfer of privatization property 
certificates to the management of a trust association? First, 
there is the possibility of using the services of genuine 
professionals in a field of financial activity, eliminating the 
necessity of independently, at one's own risk, seeking 
directions for the profitable use of privatization funds, and 
most of all, the possibility of influencing the activity of 
these joint stock companies. 
  Recently, various conjectures concerning the intermediaries 
which provide services in the distribution of privatization 
funds are spreading more actively. Perhaps it is advantageous to 
certain circles that such institutions, capable of directing the 
privatization of property on a professional basis, not arise in 
Ukraine. It will be much easier if these stocks are scattered 
among thousands of stockholders, each of whom will be deprived 
of any influence on the activities of the joint stock companies, 
rather than to have to deal with an investment fund or trust 
association, which, because of the unification of the votes of 
individual investors, will be capable of protecting their 
interests. 
  What sorts of accusations are being made against the trust 
associations? First, it is said that they do not indicate 
guaranteed dividends. This accusation can only be made by people 
who are not competent in this question, since in no civilized 
country does a joint stock company indicate the scale of 
dividends in advance. They are set according to the results of 
the work in the course of a given period at meetings of the 
joint stock company. The following reproach is also made 
concerning the trust associations: the trusts wish to use the 
funds for their own goals, without buying anything. But this 
anxiety lacks any basis at all. The privatization property 
certificates are not cash, or even Russian "vouchers;" they can 
only be used to pay for stock in enterprises that are being 
privatized. In this case, the interests of the trustee and the 
trust coincide, since until privatization funds are invested, 
they do not provide any profit. The circumstance that the trusts 
do not indicate definite terms for investing the trustees' funds 
in stocks also worries many. But the task of the trust is not to 
invest privatization certificates in the first enterprise that 
comes along, rather precisely to choose those that will provide 
profits; the trust bears the ultimate responsibility for this to 
the trustee. In this, a great deal depends not on the trust, but 
on government organs, and how fast the process of privatization 
is carried out. Now a great number of the most promising state 
enterprises are getting ready to become stock companies. The 
enterprises which have already offered their stock for 
privatization documents, are not among the most interesting ones 
from the point of view of the investor. And the final thing 
concerns the terms. Some of the "well intentioned" are advising 
that people not hurry to entrust their privatization funds to a 
trust. It is known that the term of action of the privatization 
funds in Ukraine will finish in 1995, and the majority might 
simply not be able to take advantage of them.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Chikalin: "Overcreamed, Oversweetened, </F>
Overdistilled"] 
  It seems that we are already seeing market relations with 
our 
own eyes. Here is just one example. 
  In state stores, through February sugar has gone at a price 
of 14,500 karbovantsy, and in commercial structures from 10 to 
14 thousand per kilo. 
  I have data which show that commercial structures purchased 
in Germany dozens of metric tons of cream, and offered it to 
wholesale customers at 40 to 50 thousand per kilo. But the lack 
of cash keeps it from going out to the store shelves in large 
amounts. And state trade still dictates the price for cream. 
Though customers are boycotting them, because of a lack of 
money. Today, the pace of the sale of cream has significantly 
decreased. 
  A similar picture is noted for distilled substances. The 
state is experiencing great losses from the fact that the 
necessary funds for sale of "80 proof" are not coming to its 
treasury. Not because people have stopped drinking it. They 
drank it, and they drink it. But not the drinks that state trade 
offers. The potential customer is getting around the high prices. 
  So it turns out today that commercial structures have 
"knocked down" state prices, which are set in an unknown manner, 
no one knows by whom. If they are oriented toward world prices, 
then we for a long time we have already been making our own 
"price cereal" overdistilled, oversweetened, and overcreamed. So 
it is not strange that commercial structures, which have free 
funds, have begun to buy cream, sugar, and distilled products 
where they are significantly less expensive. And state trade, 
because of a lack of cash, cannot do this, and offers us goods 
at the prices which have been set. 
  The assistant head of of the committee on pricing policy of 
the city state administration, Lidiya Tymofiyivna Tolstykh, 
explained the situation the same way. She stated that guaranteed 
prices for sugar and cream (80 thousand karbovantsy and 30 
percent "overcharge") are nevertheless a guarantee that people 
will have the possibility of obtaining these products. 
  A lowering of prices for distilled goods is awaited. Kiev 
factories have already begun putting out this production at the 
new prices. But until the "old" production is sold, we will not 
see a lowering of prices. 
  A conclusion can be drawn: to make things a little less 
expensive, today we all have to buy at "stinging" prices. But 
the majority of us cannot do this. How do we get out of this 
trap? Today there is a glimmer of hope that the competition from 
commercial with state trade will somehow resolve this issue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Karasyk, minister of agriculture and </F>
foodstuffs of Ukraine, by Georgiy Simakovich; place and date not 
given: "Ukraine Has Gone To Work the Field. God Grant It a Good 
Crop!"] 
  [Text] Spring has always been a time of hopes and 
expectations for the tillers of the land. Now that the shelves 
of delicatessen stores are becoming more desolate and the 
consumer basket of foodstuffs for the majority of common 
citizens is becoming scantier with every passing day, an 
increasing number not only of villagers but of city folks, too, 
turn their mind's eye to the future harvest. Will we succeed in 
making it a full-fledged one, in the environment of the most 
severe economic crisis and an acute shortage of many material 
and technical resources? How will the villagers be able to 
counteract a shortage of motor fuel and lubricants, fertilizer, 
pesticides, and finally, the deficit of monetary funds, apart 
from pure enthusiasm and the perennial patience of the peasants? 
After all, the well-being of each family, of each of us, depends 
on this to a significant, if not decisive, degree. This is why 
the editorial office resolved to approach, so to say, the main 
agrarian of our state--Minister of Agriculture and Foodstuffs of 
Ukraine Yu.M. Karasyk--with a request to discuss the specifics 
of the forthcoming field work and the way in which problems 
associated with them are being solved. 
  [Simakovich] Yuriy Mykhaylovych, at the beginning of March 
in 
years past, newspapers were usually replete with reports about 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes completing repairs of machinery, about 
machinery already being at the ready at leading farms, and so 
on. This year, the weather has made its contribution to the heap 
of economic problems in which the rural areas are drowning. In a 
day or two, it will be time to talk about going out to the 
fields. However, this is perhaps not the main peculiarity, is it? 
  [Karasyk] Why in a day or two? In the south, spring field 
work is already getting under way at full tilt. Soil is being 
prepared in the fields for spring crops, and moisture is being 
sealed in Crimea, Kherson Oblast, Odessa Oblast, and in some 
locations in Transcarpathia. Neither we nor the meteorologists 
could have predicted this abrupt warming up--in Crimea and the 
Kherson area, the temperature already reaches 17-18 degrees 
during the day. Meanwhile, the reserves of moisture in the soil 
are catastrophically small because of a winter without snow; in 
the south, they do not exceed 60 percent of the optimal norm. It 
has come to signs of dust storms already being noted at some 
localities in the region--the wind picks up and blows away the 
topsoil, the most fertile layer. Under the circumstances, it is 
very important to retain, as much as possible, at least the 
paltry resources of moisture that are still found in the soil. 
To this end, it is necessary to reduce the length of conducting 
field work to the bare limit and emphasize mainly its quality. 
Here is one of the peculiarities of this spring for you, and 
unfortunately, not the most important one. 
  [Simakovich] Does the main peculiarity concern perhaps the 
lamentable condition of winter crops? 
  [Karasyk] Absolutely correct. The severe freezing 
temperatures of November literally came down on the soil 
unprotected by snow and did irreparable damage to areas planted 
in winter crops. It is particularly regrettable that the 
southern regions, the main suppliers of winter wheat grain, have 
suffered the worst. In Crimea, about 90 percent of the area 
planted in winter crops will have to be replanted, and in the 
Kherson area--up to 70 percent. The state of affairs is not much 
better in Zaporozhye and Nikolayev Oblasts. By all signs, 
replanting will come to no less than 30 percent in Ukraine as a 
whole. This is not all yet. In the fall, the farmers did not 
manage to turn over 4 million hectares of the fallow land 
because of a shortage of fuel and the early onset of freezing 
temperatures. Judge for yourself what volume of work must now be 
performed in the spring, and that within the shortest period of 
time possible. 
  [Simakovich] How will the farms cope with the enormous 
amount 
of work, and in the environment of an acute energy crisis, the 
now chronic shortage of mineral fertilizer, pesticides, and so 
on? 
  [Karasyk] Well, everything does not look as dramatic as you 
imagine. The point is that all measures are now being taken with 
a view to urgently transporting the necessary quantities of 
gasoline, diesel fuel, oil, mineral fertilizer, and spare parts 
to the southern zone. 
  [Simakovich] However, I hope that this is not being done at 
the expense of other oblasts. 
  [Karasyk] Of course not. I do not want to be overly 
optimistic, but I do count on reserves of motor fuel and 
lubricants for the successful conduct of the full volume of 
spring field work being found in Ukraine. 
  [Simakovich] Yuriy Mykhaylovych! Increasingly loud voices 
are 
now referring to the insolvency of an overwhelming majority of 
farms, to kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and farmers, too, just having no 
funds to settle for motor fuel, fertilizers, pesticides, and 
machinery. Where is a way out of what would appear to be a 
hopeless situation? 
  [Karasyk] This is how the issue was raised: How to conduct 
spring field work without additional credit? In Ukraine as a 
whole, 30 trillion karbovantsy are needed to this end. Kolkhozes 
and sovkhozes simply do not have that kind of money. Under the 
circumstances, the government resolved to allocate a budgetary 
loan of sorts to the rural areas. In general outline, this is 
how it will look. The state undertakes to supply the farms with 
fuel, mineral fertilizer, pesticides, and spare parts. Kolkhozes 
and sovkhozes settle for this later with the output produced, 
that is to say, they receive all resources against a pledge of 
products. Calculations indicate that only 25 percent of the 
output produced on the farms will be required to pay back this 
loan, and the farms will dispose of the remainder on their own. 
This is the only acceptable scenario under the conditions of a 
payment crisis. 
  [Simakovich] What if yet another round of increases in the 
price of refinery products occurs? 
  [Karasyk] The course has been set for strictly fixed prices 
for motor fuels so that this will not happen, and so that prices 
for agricultural products will cover outlays on fuel. Thus, one 
liter of gasoline should cost no more than 4,150 karbovantsy, 
and diesel fuel--no more than 3,900 karbovantsy. 
  [Simakovich] However, the fate of the harvest hinges not 
only 
on the availability or absence of motor fuel, but also on a 
multitude of other components. 
  [Karasyk] Correct. However, first of all I would like to 
inform the readers that refinery products are already reaching 
rural areas. I think that the fertilizer situation will change 
substantially, too. Last year, one-half of the usual amount of 
mineral fertilizer was given to the land. This will not recur 
now. The government has proceeded to sharply reduce rates for 
gas and electricity for enterprises manufacturing mineral 
fertilizer. Therefore, it will now be profitable for the 
chemical industry to manufacture it, and for the peasants to buy 
it. I will add that Russian rubles have also been allocated to 
purchase phosphoric fertilizer and spare parts for agricultural 
machinery in Russia, and potassium fertilizer in Belarus. 
Finally, within days, the United States will be opening for us a 
credit line for the acquisition of pesticides. 
  [Simakovich] So, does it turn out that rural areas will not 
be left one-on-one with their problems? 
  [Karasyk] Of course they will not. Nonetheless, the picture 
does not look as rosy as we would like it to. Last year, nature 
was a great help to us. However, only selfless, high-quality 
work, excellent seeds, and the timely performance of all 
technological operations of the spring complex may save the crop 
this year. Previously, we did not have the experience of 
operation in the extreme conditions of a payment crisis. We are 
now acquiring this experience. In this instance, it is very 
important for the state to keep its word and not dash the hopes 
and expectations of the peasants.

<F P=106> [Interview with Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of the </F>
Parliamentary Commission on Economic Reform, and Pavlo Minenko, 
department chairman at the Lviv Trade and Economic Institute, by 
Volodymyr Oliynyk; place and date not given: "`With a Normal 
Government Ukraine Can Very Soon Become One of the Ten Most 
Developed Countries in the World'"-- first paragraph is editor's 
subhead identifying source of quoted statement] 
  [Text] -- believes Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of 
the Parliamentary Commission on Economic Reform, who recently 
returned from the U.S., where he led a delegation of 29 
Ukrainian economists belonging to the so-called shadow cabinet. 
Apropos of this, a conversation with Volodymyr Pylypchuk and 
Pavlo Minenko, department chairman at the Lviv Trade and 
Economic Institute, who was a member of the delegation. 
  [Oliynyk] What was the purpose of the Ukrainian delegation's 
visit to Colorado? 
  [Pylypchuk] Our first objective was to study the management 
system at the level of an American state and to learn what 
powers and rights the states have as compared to our oblasts. 
Which questions are decided at the government level. On which 
matters cooperation is necessary. In other words, the issue that 
has always been and still is the subject of dispute here in 
Ukraine -- namely, the "division of powers." 
  Our second objective was to complete drafting a program for 
ending the crisis in Ukraine, a program of economic reforms. In 
addition, we had a third objective -- to eliminate any 
theoretical differences among the members of our team. It was 
our goal that when our team returned, we would not only have a 
program of extraordinary measures for ending the crisis, a 
program of market reforms, but also that all the members of our 
team would be of the same opinion and agree on a single approach 
to solving all issues. That this shadow cabinet, as it has been 
called, should virtually become a single organism. 
  What is the situation in Yu. Zvyahilskyy's government? Ask 
one minister how to solve a problem and you get one answer. Ask 
a second minister, and you hear the opposite. Ask a third, and 
you get something else again. In other words, there is no one 
concept in the cabinet regarding what to do, how to do it, and 
what steps to take to conduct reforms? This is what we wanted to 
avoid. 
  [Oliynyk] Was it necessary to go to America to achieve this? 
And why there? Was it because you received an invitation from 
the U.S.? 
  [Pylypchuk] No. Our team, made up of the same people, also 
has the opportunity to visit Germany and Greece, but the 
American invitation was the first to arrive. Also, all the 
arrangements for meetings and instructors had already been made 
in the United States. Do not forget that we are on the 
threshhold of elections, and many members of our team are 
running for the office of people's deputy. Thus, the U.S. visit 
was our optimum option. Moreover, the United States is a 
traditionally capitalist country with a better defined classical 
variant of capitalism. 
  [Oliynyk] Mr. Minenko, as a member of Pylypchuk's team, what 
did you learn from this trip? 
  [Minenko] The two weeks we spent in Colorado were hard work, 
because the esteemed Mr. Pylypchuk never "got off our backs," as 
they say. We worked 16 hours a day. If my ideas differed 
somewhat, they managed to persuade me to subscribe fully to the 
program for ending the crisis. 
  [Oliynyk] What kind of work did you do in the United States? 
  [Pylypchuk] First, we listened to lectures and attended 
seminars conducted by lecturers and representatives of various 
state ministries and departments. In addition, every day after 
supper, we held our own four-hour seminars, at which we polished 
our program. 
  [Oliynyk] In other words, you have your own program for 
ending the crisis. And if you head the future cabinet, you will 
not vacillate. Incidentally, why does the government of Ukraine 
... make such poorly thought out moves? 
  [Pylypchuk] They are not a team. The government is not 
equipped with reformist skills. Each minister is a very good 
economist at the enterprise level, at the microeconomic level. I 
studied the biographies of these people -- they were all 
wonderful directors. But the economy of an enterprise consists 
of production deliveries, sales, production costs, 
profitability, prices, wages, etc. And they apply this kind of 
economy at the state level, which is a fundamental mistake. 
Because at the state level, the economy is managed with 
interest, deposit, credit, currency, exchange rate, customs, and 
budget policies. A policy of subventions, preferences, 
regulation of liquidity, a reserve policy. These are completely 
different levers, a different sphere of action, entailing a 
different understanding of economics. 
  [Oliynyk] While your were visiting the United States, 
strange 
things were happening in Ukraine. The Cabinet of Ministers 
consulted with the Union of Entrepreneurs, which is now headed 
by former Prime Minister Kuchma. It brought to mind an analogy: 
if one views the Cabinet of Ministers as a club of grand 
masters, what is its level of expertise if it invites as its 
consultants novice directors, including a wash-out grand master 
like Kuchma? What is most objectionable about this is that it is 
presented as an attempt to begin structural reform... 
  [Pylypchuk] The problem is that Yu. Zvyahilskyy's government 
has no strategy. Every politician knows that you begin by 
constructing the backbone (strategy) of a policy in order to 
know where you are heading. Then you work out your tactics, the 
steps you need to take and the order in which you have to take 
them. You do all this without explaining anything to the 
directors. Only in extraordinary circumstances, when 
superincomprehensible situations arise, does the prime minister, 
the deputy prime minister, or a minister come forth with an 
explanation. This is when it is necessary to address the people 
and say something like: "For the next three months, I will be 
performing surgery on the economy to make it sound again. I 
therefore ask you to tighten you belts and not complain." The 
people will then understand what is going on. Right?! Whereas, 
if the government continually misleads the people and does not 
itself see the light at the end of the tunnel, then whatever it 
does, whether it consults with novices or explains to elders -- 
it is all to no purpose. Clearly, these are death throes. It is 
pity that the economy has been allowed to deteriorate to this 
state. At the same time, this is a characteristic feature of the 
political situation in Ukraine. We know that the communist 
majority in parliament gave the government its best people -- I 
say this without irony -- people it had groomed to govern. But 
this merely serves as additional proof of what communists are 
good for. 
  [Oliynyk] How was your delegation received in the United 
States? As representatives of a poor, third-rate state, or as 
partners who are simply experiencing problems at this time? 
  [Minenko] We were received at a very high level. We had 
meetings and discussions at the level of the U.S. Ministry of 
Finance [Department of Treasury], the World Bank, and the 
International Monetary Fund. It was clear to us that we were 
treated as representatives of a state; moreover, we were 
constantly asked if Mr. Pylypchuk had really brought a team of 
economists with him? At the beginning, when we worked in 
Colorado, we spent only the first few days listening attentively 
to our professors. After a few days, we had to say to them: 
"Thank you, but we already know this." Later, the vice president 
of this economic institute acknowledged that the Americans who 
had met earlier with similar teams of economists from Armenia 
and Russia were impressed by the high professional level of our 
economists, because the level of instruction that we found 
uninteresting had been quite satisfactory to them. 
  Many government institutions in the United States have 
created departments that deal only with Ukraine. But apart from 
the people who work directly with Ukraine, very few people in 
America know anything about our country. A notion that is still 
popular there, and this was confirmed even by diplomats, is that 
Americans approach Ukraine as a piece of the former empire. In 
other words, this is country located somewhere over there, in 
Central Europe, it has a population of 52 million people and 
nuclear missiles aimed at the U.S., and it refuses to disarm. 
This perception of Ukraine is automatically passed on to most 
officials. We also learned that these perceptions of Ukraine are 
actively promoted by the representatives of our "older brother," 
of whom there are a total of 500 in the Russian embassy. They 
have time to attend all the receptions and events. This makes it 
difficult to counter [such perceptions]. 
  [Oliynyk] You have brought us to the second part of this 
question -- the political implication of the visit of the shadow 
cabinet to the United States. 
  [Pylypchuk] A change is taking place in the perception of 
Ukraine, of Ukrainians, their leaders, and their specialists. 
The same "older brother" is spreading disinformation that 
Ukraine allegedly lacks experts. This gave us all the more 
satisfaction to surprise the Americans, who saw after meeting 
with us that Ukraine does have experts, and high-class ones at 
that. And that there exists a program for ending the crisis. To 
which there are no objections on the part of the International 
Monetary Fund, or the U.S. Ministry of Finance, or the World 
Bank, or the U.S. Federal Reserve System. And so the Americans 
wonder: why then are no reforms being effected in your country? 
We have the necessary people and a program they support, which 
their own experts would sign on to. 
  [Oliynyk] I would also like to ask this question. How did 
you 
explain this to them? 
  [Pylypchuk] You are not the first to ask me to explain. I 
told them that there are many reformers in Ukraine but that they 
are not part of the ruling Olympus. The opposition can propose 
many things, but it is not able to implement its proposals. 
Because it has no power. I believe that a radical change 
occurred in American perceptions, and they came to understand 
that Ukraine has the necessary forces, people, intellect, and 
professional qualifications. There are also worked-out programs, 
which are not in an embryonic stage, but which outline 
specifically what needs to be done and how. This is another 
political aspect of our visit. I would rather not go on about 
the future government. All this will be possible if a parliament 
of reformers comes to power and our collective wisdom is put to 
use. If this does not happen, then all of us who made this trip 
will at least have improved our professional skills. If the 
procommunist parliament returns to power, our program, like all 
earlier programs, will lie around gathering dust. 
  [Minenko] I would like to note another aspect as well. I 
have 
in mind the large reserves of which Ukraine makes little use. 
Although our embassy is small, we have a powerful diaspora of 
Ukrainian descent -- people like Mr. Yurko Chopivskyy and Mr. 
Bohdan Futey and dozens of others, who helped us without any 
gain for themselves and literally gave us a shoulder to lean on 
to enable us to do more for Ukraine. They are very anxious to 
see Ukraine draw closer to America. 
  [Oliynyk] Your team spent a week in Washington. How did 
things go there? 
  [Pylypchuk] In Washington, we changed our method of working. 
All our experts worked in groups according to their 
specialization. I had my own program, which was closely linked 
with obtaining technical assistance for Ukraine. We agreed on 70 
million dollars in technical assistance to help speed up 
privatization in Ukraine and 20 million dollars to enable us to 
create a unified computer network in Ukraine that would make 
corruption in privatization impossible. Our delegation met with 
the U.S. Vice-President Gore's representatives, Mr. Marshall, 
and his advisors. 
  [Oliynyk] Do you think that the present government will try 
to take advantage of the results of your trip, that is, your 
program? 
  [Pylypchuk] We are prepared to help the government if it is 
interested. We are not planning to keep our program locked away 
in a drawer. Except the plan for introducing a Ukrainian 
currency -- we will never give Zvyahilskyy's government our 
methodology for this. Not until we ourselves take over... 
Because they will ruin the method for introducing the hryvnya as 
they did the introduction of the coupon, and once again blame me 
for everything. Like they did when they claimed that I had 
promised that a kilogram of lemons would cost one coupon. I 
burned my fingers on that one. They did not use my method for 
introducing the coupon and then accused me of every sin in the 
book. Nevertheless, we are prepared to advise even this 
government. Because our objective is greater: to lead the 
economy out of its present crisis, and that is why it does not 
matter to us who accomplishes this -- this government or the 
next. 
  [Oliynyk] What will happen in the economy until the 
elections 
are held? What do you predict? 
  [Pylypchuk] I have no wish to alarm people by painting 
everything in black tones, but the economy will continue to 
function at a primitive level. 
  [Oliynyk] Could you tell us the professional composition of 
the group that accompanied you to the United States and which is 
made up of people you count on. For ethical reasons it would be 
inopportune to give us their names, even though it is generally 
known that the group included Professor Chernyak and others. 
  [Pylypchuk] If we were to speak of the cabinet in broader 
terms -- I have in mind the provisional future cabinet -- this 
team is much larger: it consists of more than 200 people. There 
is a humanitarian bloc, a power bloc, and an economic block, 
which, incidentally, is made up of 60 people, only half of whom 
visited the U.S. This group includes people who are working for 
the present Cabinet of Ministers, people who are involved in 
reforms, as well as people from the executive branch. I think 
that should suffice. 
  This was my sixth visit to the United States, and each time 
during my first days there I have been overcome by despair... 
There are poor people in America; they make up 15 percent of the 
population. This time I came back with a video cassette 
portraying a "poor" American. What kind of living standard does 
this poor person have? This "pauper" has a three-storied house 
with eight rooms, albeit narrow in width. No one has such a 
cottage in Ukraine. I do not have one, nor do any of the 
moneybags who are today scaling the Olympus of power in our 
country. Let alone the furniture in these buildings -- our 
underground millionaires would be lucky to have such furniture 
here. But by American standards, this is poverty. Our society's 
living standard has yet to reach the level at which it could be 
regarded as impoverished by American standards. At the same 
time, I would like to say something else: at present, Ukraine is 
a diamond that has not yet been polished and is lying in the 
dust so that many think it to be plain glass. All that this 
Ukrainian diamond needs is to be polished a tiny bit and put 
into a dependable setting, and it will sparkle with many 
brilliant colors. To those who have already buried Ukraine, I 
would like to say: do not be in such a hurry. Ukraine is capable 
of very quickly becoming one of the top ten most developed 
countries in the world, including in terms of its living 
standard. Ukraine is poor because this parliament and this 
government are in power. This is her problem, but it is not her 
fault. That is why we now face the supertask of electing a 
normal parliament, which will form a normal government and a 
normal bank that will enable us to rise to the level warranted 
by our potential capabilities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valentina Barishpolets, specialist in </F>
taxpayer services, Administration for the Application of Tax 
Legislation under Ukraine's Main State Tax Inspectorate, by 
PRAVDA UKRAINY: "Do You Have `Wheels'? Pay the Tax!"] 
  [Text] A year has elapsed since the adoption by the 
Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers of the Decree "On Tax Rates for 
Owners of Transport Means and Other Motor Vehicles and 
Machines." However, quite a few questions are still coming into 
our offices on this matter--from motor-vehicle owners and buffs, 
as well as from the leading officials at enterpriss. 
  In this connection, the editors turned for the 
necessary explanations to the Administration for the Application 
of Tax Legislation under Ukraine's Main State Tax Inspectorate. 
Our interviewee was Valentina Barishpolets. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Have there been any changes in taxation 
since the adoption of the above-mentioned Decree? 
  [Barishpolets] Yes. In particular, the Law "On the Ukrainian 
State Budget for 1994" increased taxes levied on those juridical 
persons who are owners of foreign-made transport means obtained 
for SKV [freely convertable currency]. As of now, this tax 
amounts to 2.4 times the minimum wage per horsepower. Other 
amounts of the tax rates have remained unchanged. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Could you please tell us in greater detail 
about the procedure for paying this tax. 
  [Barishpolets] Enterprises pay it annually during the first 
six months of the year. Citizens, however, can pay this tax once 
every two years, but not later than during the first six months 
of the year in which the technical inspection is conducted. For 
example, if a person has to have a technical inspection carried 
out in 1994, he must present a tax receipt for the years 1993 
and 1994 to the GAI [State Motor-Vehicle Inspectorate] organs. A 
Person who did not pay this tax last year shall pay a tax for 
two years (1993 and 1994); moreover, the amount of this tax is 
determined on the basis of the minimum wage in force at the 
moment the tax is paid. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] And how is the tax computed? 
  [Barishpolets] Computations are carried out directly by 
enterprises and organizations, based on accounting data 
concerning the number of transport means owned as of 1 January 
of the current year. No recomputation of the tax amount is to be 
carried out in connection with the retirement or acquisition of 
transport means during the course of the year in question. 
  Citizens who have acquired transport means during the second 
six months of a particular year shall pay half the amount for 
that year. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Let's say, for example, that a motor 
vehicle 
is not used for certain reasons (its owner is on a lengthy 
business trip, there is a prolonged breakdown, etc.). What 
happens then with regard to the tax? 
  [Barishpolets] If transport means are not used, the tax 
is--nevertheless--still levied on their owners, based on general 
principles. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] To whom are tax privileges granted? 
  [Barishpolets] The following categories are exempt from 
paying this tax: 
  --general-purpose automotive transport enterprises, but only 
for transport means which are engaged in hauling passengers; 
  --institutions and organizations which are on the state 
budget; 
  --Heroes of the Soviet Union, persons who have been awarded 
the Order of Glory of Three Classes, disabled persons from the 
Great Patriotic War, and other persons who also have such 
privileges in connection with existing legislation; 
  --disabled persons having motor-scooters or motor vehicles 
with manual controls; 
  --citizens relegated to Categories 1 and 2 of those persons 
who have suffered as a consequence of the accident at the 
Chernobyl AES [Nuclear Power Station], as well as citizens 
relegated to Categories 3 and 4--prior to their being moved from 
the zone of guaranteed voluntary resettlement and the zones of 
intensified radiation ecological monitoring controls; 
  --citizens resettled from radiation-contaminated zones of 
territories as a consequence of the catastrophe at the Chernobyl 
AES to other population centers over the course of three years 
after resettlement. 
  Enterprises, associations and organizations, kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes situated in zones of guaranteed, voluntary 
resettlement and zones of intensified radiation ecological 
monitoring controls are exempt from taxation except for payments 
and contributions to local budgets. 
  And one last point in this regard. Kolkhozes and sovkhozes 
are exempt from taxation on fire engines, first-aid vehicles, 
ambulances, and buses used to carry persons. But if the 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes have been converted into joint-stock 
companies, enterprises, and the like, they are obligated to pay 
this tax, based on general principles. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Naturally, there are certain fines to be 
imposed on persons who fail to pay this kind of tax, are there 
not? 
  [Barishpolets] Of course. If an enterprise has concealed an 
item subject to taxation or has reduced the sum-total of the 
tax, it must pay into the budget the entire sum of that tax, 
plus a penalty fine amounting to twice the amount of the 
aforesaid sum. 
  For failing to submit an account of taxable items or 
executing such an account with violations, as well as for 
submitting in an insufficient or untimely manner computations or 
other documents to the tax organs, an enterprise shall pay into 
the budget an additional 50 percent of the necessary tax sums. 
  Service personnel guilty of these and other violations shall 
be held administratively liable. For paying a tax late, a fine 
shall be exacted amounting to 0.2 percent of the sum for each 
day it is overdue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mecheslav Hryb, chairman of the Supreme </F>
Soviet of Belarus, by Lyudmila Novikova, deputy editor in chief 
of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY; place and date not given: "A New Face in 
Politics: M. Hryb: 'Russia Needs Belarus, Just as Belarus Needs 
Russia'"] 
  [Text] Not long ago Mecheslav Hryb, recently a 
lieutenant general of militia, was elected the new head of 
parliament in Belarus. He is interviewed by Lyudmila Novikova, 
deputy editor in chief of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY. 
  [Novikova] Mecheslav Ivanovich, was it a surprise to you 
when 
you were elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet. 
  [Hryb] I did not want this. 
  [Novikova] Why? 
  [Hryb] Because I know the situation in the economy, 
politics, 
etc. Here one has to accept not congratulations but condolences. 
I simply fulfilled the will of the president, who committed me 
not to remove my candidacy. 
  [Novikova] How do you assess the present political and 
economic situation in the republic? 
  [Hryb] It is very complicated. In a political sense, because 
the fight for power became acute before the presidential 
elections. Between parties, between groups, and even between 
individual personalities. Only a cohesive, united, and 
governable republic can come out of the crisis. It is not 
governable today. Therefore, I am setting the task of organizing 
governability as a priority. The economic situation in Belarus 
is also extremely complicated. The volume of production is 
falling, and individual enterprises are shutting down because 
they do not have the money to buy energy resources and raw 
materials to organize production. This is on the one hand. On 
the other hand, more than 30 percent of enterprises are coming 
to a stop because they do not have products for sale. After all, 
the CIS countries are our sales market, first and foremost, 
Russia. 
  [Novikova] Western products are cheaper and of a higher 
quality, and this is what is bought. The market is the market. 
  [Hryb] The problem is that today Russia demands $74 from us 
for 1,000 cubic meters of gas. But it sells it for $17 to its 
own consumers. All of this goes into the cost of the commodity. 
Plus customs duties of up to 30 percent. And when our product 
reaches the Russian market, even if it is of a better quality, 
it is not competitive in price. 
  [Novikova] What are you doing about this? 
  [Hryb] As chairman of the Supreme Soviet, in accordance with 
the old constitution, I am the highest official, but I actually 
do not have any rights. Everything has to be coordinated by the 
Supreme Soviet, and it does the ratifying. 
  But the main thing is that we are trying as fast as possible 
to conclude an economic union with Russia. 
  [Novikova] That is, join the ruble zone once again? 
  [Hryb] Let us analyze the nuances. An economic union with 
Russia is the first step, joining the ruble zone is the second 
step. By joining the ruble zone we would be able to buy energy 
resources at the same price as Russia. The most reasonable 
variant would be to buy at world prices. I am confident that 
Russia will not be able to keep prices lower than world prices 
on its own domestic market also. We need these prices today. We 
are suffocating without them. Then, the removal of customs 
barriers is also advantageous for Russia. I think that there are 
opponents to this agreement in both Russia and our country. But 
Russia is interested in Belarus to no less a degree. We also 
have our advantages. In the final analysis, we are a corridor 
for communications with Europe. For gas and oil pipelines. For 
air defense, which we are conducting for the Russian Federation. 
There are also other military installations that are located on 
our territory in which Russia is interested. If everything is 
calculated sensibly and soberly, both sides have interests. And, 
secondly, this can be an excellent example for other states. 
  [Novikova] That is, you are again for the Union? 
  [Hryb] I am for an economic union. We have disrupted all 
facets of cooperation, and we should somehow unite them through 
the economy. Then the people will decide. 
  [Novikova] You will agree that there can be no economic 
union 
without a political one. 
  [Hryb] Why not? Why is Europe living in an economic union? 
Take the three Slavic states: Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. We 
have everything, and if we unite economically, we are 
practically independent. 
  [Novikova] But the republics have fought so long and 
persistently for independence. 
  [Hryb] Everything must have its time and place. No one is 
encroaching on our sovereignty. The Supreme Soviet is inclined 
to very active cooperation with Russia. And the population as 
well. But there are also other interpretations. For example, the 
statements of the leader of the People's Front, Poznyak, about 
Russian terrorism in Soviet Belarus and about new borders. But 
we do not accept him. The position of war and confrontation is 
not our position. All kinds of things happened in history. 
  [Novikova] Mecheslav Ivanovich, you are a lawyer. How do you 
assess the last action of our Duma concerning amnesty? 
  [Hryb] That is its business. It was able to adopt this law. 
  [Novikova] Would you adopt such a law? 
  [Hryb] Fortunately, we do not have such hostages, and there 
are practically no political prisoners to this day. We tried to 
find an accord, and we succeeded in hearing out the other side. 
  [Novikova] But you also recently had crowded rallies... 
  [Hryb] Two thousand people from the million and a half 
population of Minsk came out during the agitation and propaganda 
that was conducted for months on Independence Square. It was a 
total failure. People are sick of it. And issues should not be 
resolved at rallies. 
  [Novikova] Have you met with Yeltsin? 
  [Hryb] I have not met him in the position of chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet. I only received congratulations from him, and I 
thanked him. We had a very good conversation. 
  [Novikova] Do you have normal relations with Kebich? 
  [Hryb] They are normal. I do not know what kind of relations 
he had with Shushkevich. Today, Shushkevich comes out on the 
rostrum and says that he bears no grudges. But tomorrow they 
appear once again. That is, they appeared overnight. Then there 
are none again. Kebich and I have the same position with respect 
to orientation toward the East and development of relations with 
the West. He is engaged in his work, and I, in mine. We regard 
each other respectfully. We exchange telephone calls, if it is 
necessary. 
  [Novikova] Mecheslav Ivanovich, nonetheless, what is your 
main objective now; after all, no matter what happens, you are 
the head of state. What are you working on? 
  [Hryb] We are now working on adoption of the Constitution of 
the Republic of Belarus. To date 152 articles have been passed 
by an absolute majority. It remains to adopt the constitution in 
its entirety and a law on the process for putting it into 
effect. Then we can begin elections of the first president. 
  [Novikova] Do you think this will help us get out of the 
crisis? There is a president in many republics. 
  [Hryb] This is not the problem. When it comes to a 
president, 
it is possible to identify negative cases, and it is also 
possible to find positive cases. I think, nonetheless, that 
there are more positive cases in the world than negative ones. 
But a bad or good president will depend on whom the people elect. 
  [Novikova] Will you file your candidacy for president? 
  [Hryb] I do not have time for this now. 
  [Novikova] Whom do you see as president of Belarus? 
  [Hryb] It is better that I not name anyone, there are too 
many candidates. 
  [Novikova] What do you think, is the appearance of a second 
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov among us possible? Of the same age, the same 
ambitions, and the same social position. 
  [Hryb] Everything is possible in life. There are also rich 
people in Belarus.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Tsygankov: "`Things Would Be Harder; </F>
Things Would Be Worse': The Chairman of the Belarusian National 
Bank on Possible Unification of Belarus's and Russia's Monetary 
Systems"] 
  [Text] At a press conference held in Minsk Stanislav 
Bogdankevich, Belarus's chief banker, talked disapprovingly 
about those "heightened expectations" which exist in the society 
with regard to the absorption of the Belarusian currency. "It's 
simply amazing how tenaciously vital such expectations are," 
Bogdankevich declared, and then he uttered the sentence quoted 
in the headline above. Bogdankevich based his pessimism, first 
and foremost, on the circumstance that it is specifically the 
devaluation of the national currency which is helping to keep 
exporters afloat. "But instead of seeing these problems, society 
is maintaining and even encouraging certain illusions," he 
emphasized. 
  In speaking about the Russian-Belarusian talks, Bogdankevich 
said that the Russian side was constantly departing from 
positions which had been worked out quite some time ago. In 
contrast to previously signed agreements, Russia now considers 
it necessary to retain clearing operations. At the present time, 
moreover, the Russian experts (and these include deputy 
ministers and even ministers) are already proposing to eliminate 
the National Bank of Belarus and to open a branch of the Central 
Bank of Russia in Minsk. The Russians have also begun to 
renounce unified prices on energy resources (Prime Minister 
Kebich has steadfastly emphasized that this is the most 
important thing in the process of monetary unification); and 
they are proposing to introduce agreed-to or contract prices. To 
a question from NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA as to whether it would be 
possible--at least theoretically--for Belarus to agree to such 
conditions Bogdankevich replied: "No! We in Belarus are not 
suicidal. Neither Kebich nor Bogdankevich will ever sign such 
documents. At the same time, however, the National Bank chairman 
did reaffirm that he supported the signing of an agreement based 
on previously stipulated conditions. "We were prepared to sign 
it even yesterday," Bogdankevich declared. 
  Bogdankevich commented quite sharply on the frequent trips 
taken by Prime Minister Kebich to visit his colleague 
Chernomyrdin and their private-type, one-on-one meetings. "I 
don't understand these meetings, nor do I see their results," he 
said. Furthermore, the chairman harshly criticized Belarus's 
domestic economic policy, particularly the issuance of more than 
one and a half trillion to the agrarian sector. This money was 
distributed among the kolkhozes and sovkhozes in proportion to 
their amounts of arable lands, regardless of profitability and 
productivity. "This is not only not the path to a market-type 
economy. Such things were not done even under socialism," 
Bogdankevich declared indignantly. He reported that just during 
the first two months of this year the money supply in this 
republic doubled. In Bogdankevich's opinion, the inflation rate 
in March will exceed 50 percent; he also predicted a sharp rise 
in the rate of exchange for the dollar. 
  The National Bank chairman reaffirmed his adherence to 
market-type relations, but he stated the following with regard 
to development in Belarus: "We are not at the beginning of the 
path, but rather at the beginning of its beginning." In point of 
fact, as of right now, there is not a single state economic 
entity which has declared bankruptcy, whereas at certain 
enterprises turning out products "for the warehouse" the 
employees are earning from 500,000 to 600,000 (as compared to 
the average wage of 200,000 in Belarus). Bogdankevich termed the 
situation in the matter of accounting "communism." It is a 
situation whereby as much as you like can be taken and used 
without any intention at all of paying it back. 
  Bogdankevich's words demonstrate once again that nowadays 
within the Belarusian leadership he has remained, in fact, the 
only firm advocate of market-type relations and independence for 
this republic. Therefore, regardless of Bogdankevich's 
statements to the effect that he does not take a confrontational 
stance in relation to the government, many observers and 
journalists have a feeling of concern for his further career.

<F P=106> [Article by Larisa Sayenko: "The World: To Each Republic Its </F>
Own Zhirinovsky"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] Alexander Lukashenko is one of the three real 
candidates to the presidency in the Republic of Belarus. 
  His star rose on the political firmament all of a sudden 
Having received a right to form a provisional commission in 
charge of studying the activities of the commercial structures 
attached to the power structures, the 39-year-old state farm 
director essentially created a political scandal. It led to the 
resignation of Stanislav Shushkevich, Chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet. The "trunks" of compromising material he collected on 
top officials in the government and local Soviets earned him the 
nationwide recognition as a daredevil fighter against the mafia. 
  Probably both Stanislav Shushkevich and Vyacheslav Kebich 
wanted to use deputy Lukashenko, unaware of the rules of the 
game at the top. The "narrow-minded" Lukashenko played his part 
brilliantly, having eliminated Shushkevich and frightened 
Kebich. Having won the hearts of thousands of electors, 
Lukashenko made those "higher-ups" discard their previous 
skepticism and recognize in him a real and dangerous rival. 
  "But can you imagine someone changing at once from the 
position of state farm director to that of the president?" 
complained in the corridor one of the aides to the prime 
minister. "After all, I spoke to him, persuaded him, offered him 
a fairly prestigious position. But no, he wants to be the 
president. It's absurd." 
  From the standpoint of the nomenklatura's hierarchy this is 
truly unrealistic. A small economic manager from the Shklov 
District in the Mogilev Region is trying to oppose the prime 
minister, seen by the apparat as the only worthy candidate to 
the presidency. Nevertheless Lukashenko has experience in 
competing with Vyacheslav Kebich, both of them once passed to 
the second round of elections to the Supreme Soviet. Despite the 
fact that Kebich had for many years headed the State Economic 
Planning Committee and had the backing of a powerful 
party-bureaucratic machine, the absolutely unknown politician 
"from the plough" ceded a mere 1 percent of the votes. 
  Lukashenko came to the Supreme Soviet as a reformer. He 
always had a dislike for the party nomenklatura and had 
frictions with the district authorities, earning the reputation 
of being "excessively independent." However, he kept the Gorodok 
state farm afloat, which evidently has given him confidence that 
he will also be able to run the state. In the framework of his 
state farm enough room was found for both private peasant farms 
and cooperatives. Although from time to time some in parliament 
love to recall how the state farm director used to maintain 
order -- with his fists. 
  At that time he was active in building the Communists for 
Democracy faction in opposition to the ruling party 
nomenklatura. Today Lukashenko dissociates himself from any 
party or faction whatsoever. He preaches the renunciation of 
"political mongering", calculatingly targeting the apolitical 
and most dispossessed sections of the population -- the rural 
provinces. 
  Alexander Lukashenko speaks on behalf of ordinary, 
down-trodden and dispossessed people. He is the leader of 
repulsion and destruction, capable of electrifying the mob. 
  There is hardly a question in the Supreme Soviet on which 
deputy Lukashenko has not voiced his opinion. As his opponent 
aptly remarked in parliament, Lukashenko has proved his mettle 
as an expert on all problems without exception, "from abortion 
to missiles." Taking a superactive part in debates, Lukashenko 
has not been noticed for any "passion" for lawmaking. He has 
neither a political nor an economic program, apart from the 
nostalgic theory -- "back to the USSR." Lukashenko used to be 
the most furious opponent of privatization and private property. 
He is convinced that "state ownership has not exhausted itself 
today. In the past it created a sufficiently high level for 
people's life which we have destroyed by throwing these people 
into a pit." 
  Long before the scandalous struggle against corruption and 
on 
the eve of the October events in Moscow, at a joint 
Russian-Byelorussian meeting of the Officers' Union, one of the 
Byelorussian colonels sadly stated: "Of course, we have no 
Rutskois and Terekhovs of our own..." "But we have Lukashenko," 
a voice was heard from the hall. "Lukashenko, Lukashenko," 
rolled approvingly over the rows. 
  He is even more successful at meetings with electors in the 
provinces. He doesn't philosophize, but repeats whatever is 
being said in overcrowded buses and rural shops where people 
stand in queues waiting for cheap bread. 
  He plays his own game. Having systematized and classified 
hundreds of facts, mostly gathered from the materials of the 
KGB, the Ministry of Interior, the Procurator's Office and the 
Control Board, Alexander Lukashenko earned a personal political 
capital already by the fact that he grew indignant together with 
the people. He has already promised that in the immediate future 
he will present yet another group or corrupted persons to the 
people. The government's inaction in this situation has fuelled 
Lukashenko's activities. The struggle for moral integrity seems 
to be growing over into a mania. With touching sincerity 
Alexander Lukashenko announced, speaking live on TV, that there 
were but a few honest persons in the deputy corps. 
  Already lining up behind the lone Lukashenko's powerful 
shoulders in parliament are grey cardinals -- young talented 
pragmatist who have no chances of battling their way through the 
tightly closed ranks of those presently in power. Moreover, they 
believe that it is certainly they, not the "uncouth president," 
that will rule. 
  But Alexander Lukashenko is already declaring: "It is time 
at 
last to give them (the minority, the opposition -- L.S.) to 
understand who is the boss here." Apparat politicians shrug 
their shoulders. It's absurd if "this" boss comes to power. 
  But don't we have the most fertile ground for absurdity? Or 
is whatever is permitted for Russia forbidden for Belarus? 
  MN File: Alexander Lukashenko is 45 years 
old. Upon graduation from the Byelorussian Agricultural 
Institute he worked as an agronomist at the Shklov District of 
the Mogilev Region. His wife is the head of a kindergarten. They 
have two sons. The younger goes to school, and the older is in 
his first year at the University, studying at the International 
Department and hoping to become a diplomat. 
  The people's hero is an ascete. His favorite meal is 
potatoes, milk and hard-boiled eggs. His favourite books are 
"Ivan the Terrible" and "Stepan Razin."

<F P=106> [Interview with General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the </F>
Russian 14th Army deployed in the Dniester region, by Lyudmila 
Feliksova, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent, in Tiraspol; date 
not given: "General Lebed: New Politicians Are Needed"] 
  [Text] General Lebed needs no introduction. The 
commander of the Russian 14th Army, which is deployed in the 
Dniester region, is well known, including to the readers of 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. Coming as a liberator at the height of the 
Bendera events, he gradually, whether he wanted this or not, 
became a notable political figure, in any case, on the 
Moldovan-Dniester region horizon. He is quoted, referred to. He 
has been the most popular personality in the Moldovan mass media 
since the time he declared war on the leadership of the Dniester 
region. Apparently, a state of struggle is necessary to the 
combat general. But its gradations are assessed differently in 
both the Dniester region and Moldova. What does the general 
himself think about the current situation, how does he assess it? 
  "We will have to begin with the fact that the Dniester 
region," said the general, "has gotten into numerous political 
and economic impasses. But against this gloomy background you 
have the gentry--limousines, villas, drinking sprees; that is, 
the life of the leaders in power. 
  "A situation arose in which the regime reeled. Measures were 
required, and they followed. One of these is the special 
situation that was introduced by Smirnov's edict as a means of 
shutting people up. 
  "Processes are already going on that are not controllable. 
The situation is heating up and inclining toward social 
explosion. Everyone is fighting for survival, no one believes in 
the regime. The situation has to be relieved somehow, and the 
attention of the people has to be diverted. An image of the 
enemy helps. A foreign one--Moldova--is not suitable. They do 
not have time there now for the Dniester region. Moldova does 
not need war now, and Chisinau is following the situation on the 
left bank. 
  "I was picked for the role of internal enemy. Insulting 
leaflets and accusations that a military coup is being prepared 
with my assistance have appeared. I started to issue pay to 
officers with Russian rubles, naturally, and the howl 
immediately went up: They are ruining the economy. The question 
arises as to what kind of economy it is that can be ruined 
because of a hundred million or so, especially when the money is 
paid by Russia. 
  "War fits well in such a situation--it diverts, it writes 
everything off. Both sides are actively seeking provocations. On 
the one hand, the Dniester region prohibits the Romanian 
language and the Latin alphabet; on the other hand, Moldova is 
trying to get rid of Russian, and it is forcing an attestation. 
An irreconcilable ideology that is embedded with forceful 
methods does not lead to anything good. When the situation is 
electrified, everything can start with a trifle." 
  [Feliksova] But are things heading toward an armed clash? 
  [Lebed] Realistically they are not. We are dealing with a 
process that is artificially edging toward conflict. This and 
only this resulted in the statement of the military council of 
the army in which we warn both one side and the other. But I do 
not intend to react to petty rubbish, only if events assume a 
serious character. The people do not want to wage war. 
  [Feliksova] We hope that everyone has enough common sense 
not 
to engage in provocations. What is your prediction: What will 
happen to this region? You will agree that you did a lot to 
cause the leadership of the Dniester region to be up in arms 
against the commanding general. 
  [Lebed) But does the leadership of Moldova like me? 
  [Feliksova] Of course not. But there are several versions of 
your line of behavior. The first--you are working for Moldova. 
Second--you are carrying out the orders of certain political 
forces in Russia. And third--you are pursuing your own aims. But 
who in fact is General Lebed? 
  [Lebed] Aims? What, do I want to become a tsar? It is 
ridiculous. As a matter of fact, General Lebed falls into the 
category of people who walk alone. I am guided by common sense 
and, while this will sound immodest, also with decency in this 
situation. 
  [Feliksova] But the situation is such that there is no 
negotiating process. What is to come? 
  [Lebed] The Bendera war created a gulf between the two 
shores. Only one thing can reduce its depth and bring the 
countries closer together--time. Will they pile up hundreds of 
corpses, thousands of wounded, leave people impoverished, and 
then say: Let us be friends, boys, and live in one republic? 
This will not happen. It is my deepest conviction that there is 
only one solution--federalization. 
  Coming closer together will work then, especially because 
communications have not been disrupted at the level of ordinary 
people. If it were not for the politicians and cordons, which 
only strain the situation, things would be easier. The current 
politicians on both shores have already outlived their political 
time, they are spent material. 
  On this shore, they were caught stealing, and on 
that--President Snegur no longer has a chance to be a 
peacemaker. He does not satisfy everyone now: the Romanians, the 
People's Front, or the people. He went in one direction for four 
years, and suddenly--Stop!--sparks flew from the brakes: Let us 
go in another direction. But what was he thinking about earlier? 
They had had enough of fighting, and the state, which was once 
united, split into three parts. 
  How is this broken pot to be put back together now? With 
what 
glue? There are no guarantees that there will be no recidivists. 
The current politicians are incapable of constructive steps on 
the path to rapprochement. The turning point will come when 
there are new people, intelligent and not burdened by war, who 
are capable, without hurrying, of meeting others halfway. There 
are historical precedents for resolutions, it is only necessary 
for politicians to appear who really want peace and are ready 
for sensible compromises. 
  [Feliksova] In your opinion, do the recommendations of the 
CSCE provide any possibility for normalization of the conflict? 
  [Lebed] Yes, but the CSCE representatives did their work, 
wrote, recommended, and left. But who will do the implementing? 
The mice decided to hang a little bell on the tail of the cat 
for the purpose of timely notification of its coming. And then 
the question arose: But who will do the hanging? The situation 
is like that here. Who will do the talking. I repeat: New people 
are needed. 
<H5>  ...But in the Meantime </H5>
  Moldovan President M. Snegur is supposed to sign the NATO 
program "Partnership for Peace" in Brussels today. Great meaning 
is being given to this fact in the republic, judging by the 
commentaries of politicians. 
  I. Botnaru, acting minister of foreign affairs, said that 
Moldova's joining this program guarantees the security of the 
republic and makes it possible to begin consultations with the 
NATO bloc. 
  M. Snegur, not denying this aim, displayed his usual 
caution, 
noting that the signing does not contradict the declaration of 
independence of the republic, the policy of neutrality and the 
course it is taking toward it, and the recently conducted 
sociological poll. This does not at all signify a sharp and 
decisive reorientation of Moldova to the West. The republic will 
also further expand, as the president noted, mutually beneficial 
relations with all countries, including also the former Soviet 
republics-members of the CIS. 
  Tiraspol does not share the enthusiasm of Chisinau with 
respect to the signing of the NATO program. And the louder 
Chisinau announces a search for security guarantees for Moldova, 
the more guarded is Tiraspol's reaction and assessment.

<F P=106> [Article by Margarita Kornysheva under the rubric "Crime and </F>
the Law": "Until the Chicken Has Its Head Cut Off"] 
  [Text] Here is some information about the drug trade 
obtained from confidential sources. First, not only do 
well-established systems for the delivery and distribution of 
narcotic substances operate in Estonia, but we also have our own 
trained experts who are capable of determining the quality of 
the "merchandise" and pricing it in a highly professional 
manner. Second, there is a "fixation" on the border, where only 
"dupes," random people, get caught. Third, there is a quite well 
developed secrecy system. Fourth, cruel laws apply to the hilt 
within the drug groups--if someone quits the game, or "spills 
the beans," he therefore chooses "eternal rest" somewhere in a 
quarry in Manniku. Fifth, threats against narcotics policemen 
are increasing, and actions against them are quite real. All of 
this is happening against the background of the fact that, in 
the words of the psychiatrist Anti Liiv, "even the revolt in the 
northeastern area of the country is less of a catastrophe for 
the Estonian people than drug addiction." 
<H3>  `A Strange Small State in Which the Drug Problem Is of No 
Concern to Anyone' </H3>
  Doctor Liiv, who at one time practiced in the United States, 
maintains that this is precisely how Americans perceive Estonia. 
  As you will understand, this problem "did not exist" in our 
country until sometime in 1985, just like prostitution, 
corruption, and all manner of other "capitalist ills" "did not 
exist." Finally, they came to their senses and saw that one in 
four apprehended thieves had something to do with drugs (by now, 
one in three criminals commits the crime either intoxicated with 
drugs or in possession of these substances). In short, the 
phenomenon manifested itself sharply. Moreover, compared, for 
example, to the year 1988, which is usually the reference point, 
the phenomenon has grown to a quite respectable size. Data 
quoted by the newspaper ARIPAEV not so long ago show that 
according to the most conservative calculations, each of the 
8,000 uncovered drug addicts spends 200 kroons weekly for the 
poison. The annual volume of the local drug trade comes to at 
least 60 million kroons. How are they to be legalized? We do not 
have a law that hampers money laundering although, in an effort 
to get the endeavor off the ground, representatives of the 
competent organs have visited the West to "collect material" in 
order to offer our legislators the draft of this particular law. 
The republic still does not have a state program for combating 
drug addiction, nor is there a major specialized police unit in 
the scope of whose interests drugs would fall. Who benefits by 
so nicely sweeping under the rug a problem that clearly 
threatens the very life of our society? 
  In the opinion of Anti Liiv, and it is hard to disagree with 
him, the current government benefits. What other explanation is 
there for the fact that Estonia, a UN member, has failed to join 
a single international convention forbidding trafficking in 
narcotic substances? One cannot help wondering, all the more so 
because the last document of this kind that was accepted by the 
international community in 1988, hinders money 
laundering, requiring that commercial secrets which are of 
certain interest be revealed. In view of the absence of a 
coordinating center for drug control, our country has been 
unable to submit information about the domestic drug trade to 
the UN for three years now. 
<H5>  Narcotic Poison in Estonia Is 10 Times Cheaper Than in Europe </H5>
  This is the case on the "black" market. According to 
information obtained from the security police, a five-gram 
package of marijuana and one cubic [centimeter] of liquid opium 
cost 50 kroons, one gram of hashish--no less than 75 kroons, and 
a cubic [centimeter] of a synthetic drug (too weak for 
"professionals")--as little as 25 kroons. Cocaine belongs to a 
class of the most expensive and, apparently, least popular 
"substances" for this reason. It is not cheap in Europe, 
either--a five-gram package fetches $205. 
  At present, drugs of both vegetable origin (marijuana, 
hashish, opium milk) and medicinal origin (diazepam) are common 
in the republic. The former are more common, after all. 
Depending on the specifics of transportation, their form differs 
widely. A drug-sniffing dog "smells" drugs of vegetable origin. 
However, the contrivances of drug dealers may rob it of the 
scent. Previously, drugs were often transported in car bumpers. 
The "merchandise" was placed there, and fresh epoxy resin was 
poured over it. There is no way that a dog would "sniff out" a 
drug in this hiding place for the next three or four days. 
  Opium poppies--quite recently, this combination of words was 
associated solely with Central Asia, and to a lesser degree with 
Ukraine. However, a few years ago it was learned how to grow 
this crop in Estonia and Lithuania out of high-grade seeds 
brought in from Kazakhstan. There are hills with plantations 
between them. They can only be seen from a helicopter, and are 
not visible from the road. The owner harvests, say, one-tenth of 
a hectare, sells the crop, and buys a new house, a horse.... In 
1989 an entire syndicate delivering drugs from Lithuania to us 
was uncovered. Fourteen people ended up in the dock. 
<H5>  The Realm of Transit </H5>
  Poison comes to Estonia from Russia, Lithuania, Central 
Asia, 
and the Caucasus. Luckily we cannot afford Western products. New 
times have resulted in new opportunities for drug sales. The 
transit of drugs through the Baltic area, in particular through 
"us," previously without precedent, at any rate on this scale, 
has become established. 
  Given the actually nonexistent border and the "most 
incorruptible" customs in the world, the organization of 
deliveries is not too exacting an endeavor. Outside groups have 
appeared which have ultimately established themselves solidly 
here. The deep pockets of their members have been helpful in 
securing residence permits or citizenship for them. And how many 
nerves do the common residents of Estonia shatter battling for 
the same?! 
  According to data from the security police, everyone and his 
brother plies the drug trade: The drug business in Estonia is 
controlled by Azeri, Perm, Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Riga, and 
Krasnodar groups. For example, the Azeris control the delivery 
of marijuana and hashish, and people from Krasnodar--that of 
both marijuana and opium poppy. A case in which the traffic 
police stopped a new Opel, in whose trunk 10 kilograms of 
marijuana were found, at 1915 on 4 January on the Tartu Highway 
close to the locality of Moega, is characteristic. It was 
learned later that the drug was being transported from the Viru 
section of the border and was controlled by an Azeri "company." 
Most likely they were driving to an out-of-the-way location in 
Harju Rayon. Practitioners are aware of these cases. The 
interested person locates a hamlet with a granny as old as the 
hills: "Here are 100 'greenbacks' for you, go buy yourself a 
goat. In return, put my suitcase away somewhere, and let it sit 
there until needed." The old woman does not care: "Son, toss it 
in the hayloft. I am not pressed for space." 
  All "outsiders" have connections to local "brigades," more 
often than not Russian-speaking, which deliver, for example, 
opium poppies from the areas of the Chu Valley and Issyk-Kul in 
Kyrgyzstan. The pattern is as follows: the south--Estonia--our 
countrymen pick it up, pay for it, and transport it to 
Scandinavia through their own channels. Over there, dealers get 
the "merchandise" and dispose of it "on the spot" (the lion's 
share of narcotic substances remains in the region) or ship it 
on to Europe. 
  According to information from the Department of Police of 
the 
Republic of Estonia, last year more than 100 kilograms of 
various drugs were confiscated in the territory of the republic. 
Specialists believe that this was quite a lot, but they state 
sadly right away: Certainly, more than that went abroad. 
<H5>  The Black Triangle </H5>
  This consists of the suppliers, distributors, and consumers 
of poison. As a rule, those who put drugs in circulation do not 
"get high" themselves. They are more cunning and slippery than 
the usual common criminals. 
  An alarming situation has developed in Tallinn. Police 
functionaries are aware of about 30 apartments in which the 
manufacturing of drug preparations is organized on a large 
scale. According to data of the law enforcement organs, 
gatherings of those fond of smoking or shooting up form 
virtually on every street! Drug addicts are becoming a class. 
Incidentally, there are people among them who are quite high on 
the social ladder. Terrifying reports have been received from 
some schools in the capital city--some students of senior grades 
(but not only them!) become links in the chain of the 
distributors of narcotic substances, almost inevitably getting 
their first taste of the latter. 
  People in the know maintain that so-called "pure" drug 
addicts do not exist in nature. This means that people who have 
become addicted to drugs are prepared to do anything ahead of 
time, driven by the fear of "withdrawal throes" alone. Let us 
say that such a person picks up three or four kilograms of 
"merchandise," keeps one-third, and sells two-thirds. Chasing 
clientele, he would be happy to get anyone and everyone 
"hooked." Be that as it may, this is an income, although there 
is a risk of incurring criminal liability. Of course, they 
steal, too, but the funds procured in this manner are not major. 
  Specialists predict it will not be long before high-capacity 
underground plants for manufacturing drug preparations go on 
line in Estonia. One does not have to be a specialist to duly 
appreciate the exceptionally favorable conditions that bring 
this "bright future" closer. There is nothing standing in the 
way of the time of prosperity coming to the soil of Estonia for 
a business which unfortunately has ranked second after the arms 
trade throughout the world.

<F P=106> [Article by Leidur Rannamets: "Is the Recession in Industry </F>
Over?"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Mart Laar even reported to the 
NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE, an American newspaper, that inflation 
in our country was supposedly completely under control, and that 
the rate was only 3.6 percent last year. Later, an attempt was 
made to blame dishonest American journalists for this almost 
tenfold error, but it was not that successful. The fact is that 
we recently began relying too much on self-advertisement, 
without caring much about the accuracy of our figures. 
  The latest issue of EESTI STATISTIKA (No 12, 1993) presented 
information about the development of industry last year. So that 
there will be doubts about its authenticity, we will cite the 
exact text: "The data on production volume in industry were 
collected from all state and municipal enterprises and other 
enterprises with more than 100 employees and from a sample group 
of other enterprises. The sample data were then extrapolated to 
all enterprises." In short, there is still no more definitive 
and factual information in Estonia than the data of 
statisticians. The research of the Bank of Estonia cannot be 
trusted because it is an interested party. 
  The publicists of the "Estonian miracle" usually discuss 
matters in terms of money--how many million kroons' worth of 
various goods were produced. Is this convenient? Of course it 
is, in view of the fact that the rate of inflation was over 30 
percent last year. Therefore, we will discuss the situation not 
in terms of kroons, but in terms of the physical output of the 
main types of Estonian industrial products.

  Incidentally, the decline of production volume can also be 
measured in terms of money. The industrial product last year 
amounted to 14.6107 billion kroons after turnover and excise 
taxes. State and municipal enterprises accounted for 63 percent 
of the total, or 9.238 billion kroons. Overall production volume 
was 30 percent below the 1992 figure (in comparable prices), and 
1992 is known to have been a year of sharply reduced production 
volume in industry. According to the data of the Ministry of 
Economics, general production volume was approximately 60 
percent below the 1989 figure. The output of several goods was 
reduced to a fraction of the previous figures, and some goods 
simply ceased to be produced. These include phosphorus 
fertilizer, sulfuric acid, power cable, pulp, feed proteins, and 
notebook and writing paper. 
  There were also the first signs of stabilization in some 
industries. Output exceeded the 1992 figure in the case of oil 
drilling equipment, ethyl alcohol, electric coke, fish products, 
rugs, liqueurs, soft drinks, cigarettes, paints and varnishes, 
starch, and jewelry. Approximately one-fifth of the 300 largest 
enterprises managed to adapt to the new economic conditions. 
Meanwhile, however, output decreased at more than 130 state and 
municipal enterprises. Large pulp and paper enterprises went 
bankrupt. There are still many candidates for bankruptcy. Some 
are being liquidated and others are being converted or 
reorganized. The rate of the privatization of large enterprises 
is clearly unsatisfactory. 
  In December Estonian industry produced goods worth 1.4802 
billion kroons, or 2 percent less than in December 1992 in 
comparable prices.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Estonia Is Doubling Its Exports and </F>
Redirecting Its Trade to the West"] 
  [Text] Estonia, a Baltic republic with a population 
of 1.5 million, ended the year of 1993 with a negative balance 
of 1.052 billion kroon--more than 75 million dollars--in foreign 
trade. 
  In spite of this, exports were almost double the 1992 figure 
and amounted to 11.575 billion kroon (the exchange rate of the 
Estonian kroon at the end of 1993 was 13.56 kroon to the U.S. 
dollar). Imports, according to the Estonian Department of 
Statistics, were approximately 1.5 times as high as in 1992 and 
reached 12.627 billion kroon. 
  Experts predict that exports and imports of goods in 1994 
will amount to approximately 20 billion kroon each, with a 
minimal positive balance. 
  According to specialists in the Estonian Ministry of 
Economics, foreign trade with the CIS countries, which 
previously exceeded 50 percent of the total, decreased to 25 
percent in 1993 when Estonian industry was redirected toward the 
Western market. 
  Estonia's main trade partner in 1993 was Finland, which 
accounted for 24.1 percent of all foreign trade, followed by 
Russia--21.7 percent, Sweden--9 percent, and Germany--7.7 
percent. Finland also took the lead among importers--37.6 
percent, followed by Russia--12.2 percent, Germany--9.1 percent, 
Sweden--8.6 percent, and Switzerland--5.7 percent. Food products 
were predominant in exports and imports, representing 23 percent 
and 14.1 percent of the respective totals. 
  According to the forecasts of specialists from the Economics 
Institute of the Estonian Academy of Sciences, the production 
growth that was recorded in Estonian industry starting in March 
1993 will continue in 1994. The gross national product in 1993 
was equivalent to 20.9 billion kroon, or 6.7 billion kroon above 
the indicator for the previous year. Experts expect the GNP to 
reach 30.4 billion in 1994. 
  Specialists in the Estonian Ministry of Economics believe 
that industrial production will grow primarily as a result of 
foreign investments. Whereas the amount invested in industry in 
1993 was around 2.5 billion kroon, the indicator in 1994 will 
exceed 4 billion (Estonia's foreign debt reached 109 million 
dollars in 1993). Specialists in the Estonian Ministry of 
Economics feel that the growth of investments will depend on 
programs for the revitalization of Western capital investments 
and laws to stimulate business. 
  Teet Rajasalo, the leading specialist at the Economics 
Institute, feels that genuine economic growth can be expected in 
1995. In his opinion, the rate of inflation in the country will 
decline gradually. According to preliminary data, inflation 
reached 30 percent in 1993, this year it could drop to 25 
percent, and in 1995 it could be as low as 15-20 percent.

"Foreign Investments in Estonia"] 
  [Text] 
  How much foreign capital has been invested in Estonia 
over any given period of time is a question that elicits 
different replies from different agencies, or different sources 
of information. 
  Figures published in the media on the volume of foreign 
investments made in Estonia over a certain period of time often 
show only a part of the actual investments--namely, amounts 
making up the equity of joint ventures being formed over a 
certain period. This information is gathered by the business 
register of ESA [Estonian Bureau of Statistics], where all the 
new ventures are registered, including both joint ventures and 
those financed by foreign capital exclusively. This data makes 
it possible to obtain an overview of new ventures being formed 
in Estonia over a given time period, including the extent of 
foreign capital in their equity. What presents a problem here is 
that many of the ventures are formed either to be resold (the 
so-called shelf-enterprises), for one transaction only, or for 
other such reasons, that would necessitate corrections to be 
made in the amounts obtained from the business register. 
According to data received from the receivables department at 
the Bank of Estonia, foreign capital invested as equity in new 
ventures over the past year only accounted for about 38 percent 
of the total of foreign investments made in Estonia. 
<H5>  What Are Foreign and Direct Investments? </H5>
  According to international methodology, foreign investments 
consist of direct and portfolio investments. A direct investment 
is an investment that guarantees voting rights in the management 
of the venture (enterprise, bank or fund), which enables the 
investor to influence the performance of the venture. Since 
these criteria could vary in the case of different ventures, a 
direct investment, according to international convention, is one 
that amounts to at least 10 percent of the assets or equity for 
a given venture. Hence, direct investment is a form of foreign 
investment where a resident of one country (direct investor) 
owns 10 percent or more of the assets or equity of an enterprise 
domiciled in a different country. 
  A direct investment involves: 
  1) an initial transaction between partners resulting in a 
direct investment relationship between them; 
  2) subsequent transactions between their enterprises or 
their 
affiliates. 
  Making up the other form of foreign investments are the 
portfolio investments representing ownership of less than 10 
percent of the assets or equity by a non-resident. 
  Since portfolio investments are still negligible in Estonia 
for the time being, we can apply the term 'foreign investments' 
when speakig of foreign direct investments. 
<H5>  Components of Direct Investments </H5>
  Direct investments, shown under liabilities on the balance 
sheet currently being prepared by the Bank of Estonia, consist 
of the following: 
  1) Increasing assets or equity; 
  - in joint ventures being created during a certain period 
due 
to foreign investments (new investments); 
  - in joint ventures already operational due to an influx of 
foreign capital (supplementary investments); 
  2) Reinvested income, consisting of the foreign investor's 
portion of undistributed profits of the joint venture, and which 
are left at the disposal of the enterprise operating in Estonia, 
enabling the development of the latter; 
  3) long-term loans [.sup]1[/] obtained from foreign 
investors, after the deduction of payments; 
  4) short-term loans obtained from foreign investments, after 
the deduction of payments; 
<H5>  Sources of Data </H5>
  The Bank of Estonia gets its data on new investments for the 
period being viewed from the business register of ESA's main 
computing center. The difference between data obtained from the 
business register and data used in calculating the liability 
total for the state can be attributed to the assumption that at 
least 20 percent of businesses registered during a certain 
period have not yet received their foreign funding, and that 
some of the joint ventures are fictitious (created primarily to 
be resold), only 80 percent of the total investment figure 
obtained from the business register of ESA's main computing 
center gets applied to the liability balance of the state. 
  Data on other components of direct investments are obtained 
by means of a direct survey of businesses conducted quarterly by 
the receivables department of Bank of Estonia. 
<H5>  Volume of Foreign Investments </H5>
  During the first nine months of 1993, foreign investors 
placed roughly 1.5 billion kroons in businesses based in Estonia. 
  Initial funding for new ventures amounted to 561.1 million 
kroons. This amount also includes proceeds from the sale of 
state enterprises to non-residents. Since the privatization 
process is only beginning, foreign funds from the sale of state 
enterprises have not been significant. Assets of joint ventures 
already operational have increased by 246.4 million kroons over 
the nine months of last year, due to the influx of foreign 
capital. In the third quarter, the influx of foreign capital 
into joint ventures already operational exceeded, for the first 
time, the foreign investment total in new ventures. If the 
influx of funding into joint ventures already operational 
accounted for 16.2 percent of all the foreign capital coming to 
Estonia during the first quarter, and 7.8 percent during the 
second quarter then, by the third quarter, it had risen to 51.7 
percent. It seems that the more vigorous of the joint ventures 
are beginning to gain momentum, and the creation of new ventures 
will start tapering off gradually. 
  The dynamics of the next important component of direct 
investments--reinvested proceeds--showed steady growth, which 
signifies increased productivity in the performance of joint 
ventures. During the nine months of 1993, reinvested proceeds 
amounted to 262.7 million kroons. The difference between the 
pay-out and pay-back amounts of long-term loans extended by 
direct investors amounted to 104.3 million kroons, and the 
difference between the pay-out and pay-back amounts of 
short-term loans extended by direct investors amounted to 281.4 
million kroons. 
  Current projections show that foreign investments made in 
Estonia during 1993 total slightly over 2 billion kroons. More 
accurate data will be available by mid-February. 
<H5>  Estonia's Basic Business Partners </H5>
  Last year, the greatest number of joint ventures was formed 
with Finnish companies (1,212 for nine months, which includes 
502 for the third quarter). Once again, it should be pointed out 
that many of those businesses are not operational, and may never 
become operational. Finland was followed by Sweden with 246, 
Russia with 203, Germany with 88, United States with 31 
companies, etc. 
  Analyzing the volume of initial funding in new ventures by 
different states showed that Sweden placed first, followed by 
Finland, United States, Russia and others. 
  Even though Finland, Sweden, Russia and Germany are our 
basic 
business partners for both the number of new ventures and the 
volume of initial capital invested in them, these states are not 
among the first 10 for the average volume of funds invested in 
one business. Based on that indicator Finland, for example, was 
number 22 among the 41 countries whose companies invested in 
Estonian businesses. Thus, many relatively small joint ventures 
are formed with these countries, as our closest neighbors. 
  A state-by-state analysis of foreign partners contributing 
to 
the influx of foreign capital in joint ventures already 
operational shows steady gains for ventures that are in 
partnership with Swedish companies. In second place for their 
volume of additional funding in joint ventures already 
operational in Estonia are Finnish companies, followed by 
Italian and Irish companies. 
  Estonian companies are maintaining intensive investor 
relationships (basically for loans and commercial credit) with 
business partners from Netherlands, Switzerland, Great Britain 
and Denmark. 
  For the productivity of their performance (based on the 
volume of reinvested proceeds) one could point to joint ventures 
formed with Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands. 
<H5>  Areas Attracting Foreign Investors </H5>
  The biggest portion of foreign investments (roughly 45 
percent) goes into industry, followed by wholesale and retail 
trade, leasing of property and business services. Also worth 
mentioning are direct investments in hotels and restaurants, 
also in transportation, warehousing and communications. 
  Looking at the dividend and interest payments to direct 
investors, one can conclude that a relatively large number of 
joint ventures either do not have to pay dividends during a 
certain period (depending on the charter agreement), do not turn 
a profit yet, or are not out for immediate profit (in the form 
of dividends), but are there to develop the market or for some 
other such reason.

  [Text] In conclusion, it should be pointed out that even 
though most 
of the joint ventures being surveyed submit their data on time, 
in accordance with questionnaires sent to them by the Bank of 
Estonia, there are still many shortcomings. Receiving more 
complete data is vital to the analysis of our country's economic 
situation, which is the cornerstone of the economic policies to 
be developed. As feedback, the latter inevitably impacts the 
operating conditions of all businesses. This is why we want to 
take this opportunity to ask, once again, that all businesses 
who receive survey forms from Bank of Estonia's department of 
receivables for the purpose of calculating the liabilities 
total, fill them out properly and return them promptly.

  [Text] 
  On Friday, eight banks, along with the Ministry of 
Finance and the central bank, decided to establish AS Eesti 
Vaartpaberite Keskdepositoorium [The Central 
Securities 
Depository Corporation of Estonia], which will administer a data 
base with complete information on all the securities being 
traded on the market. 
  The Securities Depository will maintain a registry of all 
officially issued securities and any buying and selling 
transactions involving them. The depository will have data on 
the prices and quantities of securities, on property put up as 
collateral for them, and other information regarding securities. 
The data in the central depository should make securities more 
trustworthy, and enable putting them up as collateral for loans. 
  Rein Usin, chairman of the board of Forekspank [Foreks 
Bank], 
said that plans call for setting up the depository within two 
months. The system would be developed by local specialists. A 
specialized system for the depository could have been purchased 
but, in addition to the high price (50 million kroons), this 
could have caused problems with compatibility. 
<H6>  The Central Securities Depository Corporation of Estonia was 
formed by: </H6>
  Pohja Eesti Pank [The Bank of Northern Estonia] 
Hansapank 
[The Hanseatic Bank] Huvitusfond [The Compensation Fund] 
Eesti uhispank [Estonia's Communal Bank] Tallinna Pank

Bank of Tallinn] Eesti Forekspank [Estonia's Foreks Bank] Eesti 
Sotsiaalpank [Estonia's Social Bank] Holdings of shares are also

<F P=106> [Article by Karmo Kaas: "Sales of Shares in State </F>
Enterprises To Start"] 
  [Text] 
  The Privatization Agency is getting ready to privatize 
30 state-owned companies through a public offering of shares 
scheduled for June. Privatization of state property through the 
sale of shares should accelerate the development of Estonia's 
securities market which, in turn, would speed up development for 
the entire economy. 
  "Many things still remain unclear about privatizing state 
property through the sale of shares," admitted Vaino 
Sarnet, 
executive director of the Privatization Agency. "It has been 
determined that the sale of shares is necessary, but no detailed 
plan for the process has been established so far. Also, some of 
the legislative measures currently in force will have to be 
changed." 
  Right now, a listing is being compiled of enterprises whose 
shares could be sold. An important criterion for an enterprise 
to be selected is its economic stability, enabling it to 
continue normal business activity throughout the entire 
privatization period. He added that privatization through 
selling shares could make for a longer period of privatization 
than the sale of enterprises at auctions or through previously 
arranged international negotiations. 
  Another criterion for the selection of enterprises is that 
they be known well enough to the wider public. 
  Sarnet said that, all these factors considered, the planning 
now calls for starting privatization through the sale of shares 
by selling the state's portion of jointly held companies, since 
their economic condition is sufficiently stable, and they are 
mostly well known. Besides, jointly held companies have a strong 
motivation to be privately owned, as that would be conducive to 
bringing in new investments. 
  The extent of shares to be sold in the first round has not 
been determined, according to Sarnet, but he does not favor 
selling off big blocks of shares of any given company. For 
openers, sales should be limited to blocks of about 10 to 20 
percent of the total number of shares, in order to establish the 
market price of shares, and to reduce the impact of better 
informed investors on the whole process. 
<H5>  RKO's To Be Traded Freely </H5>
  For selling part of the shares in state enterprises for 
RKO's 
[national capital debentures], the government will have to 
resolve, according to Sarnet, whether or not RKO's are going to 
be traded freely. Last week, the privatization chief made a 
presentation to the government on this matter, in which he 
favored turning RKO's into freely traded securities, since that 
would reduce the state's liability to owners of RKO's, and also 
bring about their wider use in the whole privatization process. 
  As state enterprises are being privatized, more and more 
enterprises are finding new owners, as weaker ones go bankrupt. 
  "This also means diminishing chances for RKO owners to use 
these debentures in the privatization of state enterprises, and 
the responsibility for it will revert to the state," Sarnet said. 
  Trading RKO's freely means that people can decide for 
themselves whether to use debentures in the course of 
privatization, or to sell them. Making that decision also places 
responsibility for the use of these debentures on their owners. 
  In the course of privatizing a state enterprise, an option 
could be given to privatize some portion of the enterprise for 
RKO's, which the investor would have to buy up. This way, the 
use of RKO's in privatization would be diffused between all the 
companies. 
  Sarnet said that people can use RKO's in the privatization 
of 
state enterprises either by participating directly in the 
privatization process, or through investment funds. "The latter 
method would prevent the formation of a scattered group of 
owners, that would make the management of the company more 
difficult," Sarnet said, "but the state cannot set up any 
restrictions here, as public opposition to such a move would be 
too great." 
<H5>  Shares To Be Entered in Data Base </H5>
  The head of the Privatization Agency said that current 
planning calls for the sale of shares to be handled 
electronically, through the depository of securities. The first 
step in that direction will be the opening of electronic 
privatization accounts for owners of privatization securities. 
  The depository is a data base containing information on all 
securities being traded on Estonia's securities market. All the 
buying and selling of securities on the securities market will 
be handled through the depository, from which one can also 
obtain information on the prices and quantities of securities, 
the assets backing them and other such. 
  According to Rein Usin, board chairman of Forekspank [Foreks 
Bank], the need to sell shares of state enterprises accelerated 
the formation of the depository, and it will certainly come in 
handy when selling shares of state enterprises, but its creation 
would have been inevitable even without that. 
  "The securities depository is one part of the system known 
as 
the securities market. As long as there is no depository, the 
securities market could not be activated," Usin said. 
<H5>  Credit Market Is Expanding </H5>
  According to Usin, the existence of the depository for 
securities also helps to expand the credit market. Up until now, 
there has been no private property that could be put up as 
collateral for a loan but, relying on the information in the 
depository, securities could be put up as collateral for loans. 
Sarnet remarked that with the creation of the depository, 
confidence in the Estonian securities market would go up, 
because it will keep any counterfeit or uncovered securities 
from participating in the market. 
  Usin admitted that the creation of the securities depository 
has taken a long time, because it is the only part of the 
securities market that does not make a profit. Finally, the 
point has been reached, where a large number of banks, along 
with the central bank and the Ministry of Finance, have decided 
to join forces and come up with the capital for creating the 
depository as a separate legal entity. 
  Commenting on having shares of state enterprises entering 
Estonia's securities market, the head of Forekspank said that 
these will be in the market temporarily, increasing that portion 
of securities that derive from ownership. 
  "Along with the development of industry and agriculture, 
there will be an increase in the market share of commercial 
paper, which will eventually make up the bulk of securities 
being traded in the market," Usin said. 
<H6>  Privatizing Enterprises Through Public Offering of Shares </H6>
<H6>  Plan of Action Up Until August 1, 1994 </H6>
  Selection of enterprises for the public offering of 
shares. List 1. (roughly 5 enterprises) List 2. (roughly 30 
enterprises). 
  Preparation of prospectus on the stock issue. 
  Creation of depository for securities. 
  Legislative measures regulating investment funds. 
  Licencing of investment funds. 
  Procedures for the public offering of shares 
(government decree). 
  Procedures for the issue and notation of shares. 
  Public Relations campaign. 
  Approval of privatization terms for shares.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Helsinki HUFVUDSTADSBLADET in Swedish on 
8 March on page 8, in an article by Tomas Hellen, describes 
efforts of Estonian towns, especially Parnu, to improve their 
harbors thereby increasing trade with Western countries. 
  As in Finland and other countries around the Baltic 
following 
the breakup of the Soviet bloc, the harbor towns in Estonia are 
already competing in trying to quickly adapt to new trade 
patterns. No other component of the former Soviet Union has 
reoriented its foreign trade structure to the West as thoroughly 
or rapidly as has Estonia. Today, half of Estonia's exports go 
to Finland and Sweden, and the earlier completely dominating 
East bloc trade has almost entirely dried up. Even the energy 
dependence on Russia has been broken: The country is now at 66 
percent self-sufficiency, and the remaining requirement is 
mainly met by imports from the West. 
  Under the Soviet Union, the harbors of Estonia served 
entirely the needs of the empire, and in Soviet fashion the 
effort was on centralization and creation of large units. The 
symbol for this is Tallinn's outer harbor, Muuga, which was 
built by Finnish companies for handling the state's grain 
imports from the West. At the same time, the smaller harbors in 
Estonia were completely closed to traffic and allowed to 
deteriorate. Soviet authorities always cited so-called security 
concerns as the reason for its maritime policy. 
  The reviving activity and ambitious planning found at Parnu, 
the formerly lively Gulf of Riga port, is a case in point. 
Reopened to commercial traffic only in 1989, for almost 50 years 
it had functioned almost exclusively as a Soviet naval base and 
as home port for the local deep-sea fishing kolkhoz. With the 
end of the Soviet Union, the kolkhoz lost the market for its 
"catch quotas" set by Moscow and is now for all practical 
purposes bankrupt and it ships laid up. 
  Overall, however, conditions have gradually improved for the 
harbors, which are being operated at least temporarily by 
municipal governments. This is perhaps again seen dramatically 
in the case of Parnu. Seen as having good potential as an export 
harbor, it is located at the town center a few miles up from the 
mouth of the Parnu River. Last year its harbor facilities 
handled over 300,000 tons of cargo. Most of the volume 
constituted exports, with shipments of lumber and peat to Sweden 
in turn making up most of this. At the end of this year still 
another important product will be added when a newly constructed 
Swedish plant for making sandbox sand will start operating. 
  City officials claim they have made harbor fees the lowest 
in 
the country to attract business and see the most immediate 
prospects for increasing port usage lying with passenger 
traffic. Thanks largely to foreign investments, again mostly 
from Sweden, there has been a lively restoring of shops, hotels, 
and restaurants, and many new ones have been built. Largely due 
to this, the town is regaining its old reputation as a resort 
center for Scandinavian and German tourists. This summer 
authorities expect cruise line visits for the first time since 
before the war. Kristina Cruises of Finland has talked with 
officials about making Parnu a port of call part as part of a 
new Estonian cruise route. A Baltic boating festival next August 
is also expected to boost Parnu as a tourist resort. 
  Regarding long-range efforts to develop shipping, the 
Estonian Government has submitted completed plans to the 
Investment Bank and the European Bank for Redevelopment in order 
get financing to improve and expand wharves, warehouses, and 
other port buildings through soft loans. Authorities believe 
that approval of the project would permit Parnu to double its 
cargo handling capacity to 600,000-700,000 tons per year. The 
proposal also includes funding for dredging the harbor from the 
current 6-6.5 meters. This would allow ships of up to 3,000 grt 
[gross registered tonnage] to call at the port. 
  Parnu's main drawback is that it lacks direct rail 
connections eastward. Nevertheless, a Parnu port official 
envisions a key regional economic role: "Parnu can become 
Estonia's next-largest harbor after Tallinn. We aren't talking 
about the transit traffic with Russia, but we are trying to find 
a niche in our natural hinterland in the southern part of 
Estonia." 
  However, many infrastructure deficiencies remain to be dealt 
with even if the international agencies grant funding. In 
addition to the mentioned poor land-transportation connections, 
an even more urgent problem needing solution is the lack of 
icebreaker vessels in the Gulf of Riga, which because of the 
unusually harsh winter this year was closed until around 
mid-March. Estonia has only two icebreakers, both obtained from 
Finland, and these are fully occupied in the Gulf of Finland 
keeping open the vital Tallinn area ports. (Finland also 
recently sold an older icebreaker to Latvia.) 
  In addition, other Estonian ports, most importantly 
Haapsalu, 
have similar harbor development plans for which they are seeking 
foreign funding. Parnu's Gulf of Riga neighbor Salacgriva, in 
Latvia, is seen as another competitor. 
  Muuga will likely continue to remain unchallenged as 
Estonia's most important harbor, however, due to its good rail 
communications with Tallinn and east to Narva and St. 
Petersburg. Moreover, it has the deepest harbor in the country, 
18 meters, which means that any ship able to transit the Danish 
straits can call there. It also has by far the best 
cargo-handling facilities and equipment. Paldiski, located to 
the east of Tallinn, may regain some of its prewar importance 
after the former Soviet naval base is closed, but much work will 
need to be done in clearing the harbor of sunken ships and 
rebuilding deteriorated facilities.

"Crime in Estonia Increasing Explosively"] 
  [Text] Estonia today is among those countries of Europe 
suffering from the worst crime situation, and Tallinn is one of 
the most dangerous cities in the world. This emerges from the 
Estonian police statistics for 1993. 
  "The number of murders has increased by 60 percent since 
1992, and measured by 10,000 inhabitants, this is 1.5 times more 
homicides as in New York," states Priit A. Kelder, chief of the 
International Division of the Estonian Police. 
  Estonia has only 1.6 million inhabitants. 
  There are three clearly different categories of homicides: 
family murder, arbitrary murder, and organized criminal gang 
murder. 
  Only 66 percent of homicides are solved, and the clearing 
percentage in cases involving other types of violence is 
significantly lower. 
  "Our legislation is obsolete, our controls on the border 
with 
Russia poor, and police personnel lack training," explains 
Kelder. 
  The job of policeman in Estonia is not prestigious, training 
is brief, and the pay is under the national average. Twenty 
percent of policeman quit the force annually to work in the 
private sector, which pays significantly better. 
  Organized crime in Estonia is especially tied to the Russian 
mafia, where there are many former Red Army officers. 
  "According to what we have detected, all homicides have been 
committed with illegal weapons and weapons coming from the 
Russian Army," says Kelder. 
<H5>  55 Bombings -- All Unsolved </H5>
  An entirely new phenomenon that the Estonian police have 
been 
presented with is that of bombings. The number of bombings rose 
last year to 55. The bombs are homemade or originate from 
Russian military depots. 
  "Not one bombing has been solved. But we have strong 
suspicions that the perpetrators belong to the organized 
underworld, the mafia, and we have good leads to pursue. In the 
future, many bombings are going to be solved," assures Kelder. 
  The explosions often are directed at at business owners who 
refuse to pay the mafia so-called protection. There are owners 
in Tallinn who have been forced to pay from 10 to 50 percent of 
their monthly gross in order to avoid being bombed. 
  Bombings have also been directed at the police. Two police 
stations in Tallinn were subjected to bombings last year, and 
three police cars were blown up. In some cases the police have 
been almost in a position to arrest the perpetrator. 
  In May an Italian experts group that has specialized in 
combating the Mafia is coming to help the local police in 
fighting it. 
  Finnish and Swedish police have also trained and equipped 
some units of the Estonian police force. From Germany the police 
have received new police cars and communications equipment. 
<H5>  Meri Warns </H5>
  Estonia's President Meri has warned of the wave of violence 
and the explosive increase in crime. 
  "Two poles of power may arise in this country: the legal and 
illegal," says the president. He has appealed abroad for help in 
case the police are not successful against this violence wave. 
  "If Estonia becomes a smuggling corridor for Kurdish 
refugees, radioactive substances, precious stones, and other 
illegality, the international community will find it difficult 
to regard us as a responsible and credible trade partner," said 
the president recently. 
  Among other things, Meri seeks a more effective guarding of 
the border with Russia. He refers to the human smuggling in 
February, when 66 Kurds were detected inside a closed container 
on a ferry from Tallinn to Stockholm. The Estonian police 
suspect a human-smuggling chain with headquarters in Moscow and 
Kiev. From there, the refugees are smuggled to Sweden and 
Finland via Estonia and Latvia. 
  A couple of weeks ago, police also found a 2.5-kg 
radioactive 
object in a container in Tallinn harbor. It was from Russia and 
on its way to Scandinavia. 
  An equally intensive smuggling activity is also occurring in 
the car market. A third of all expensive automobiles driving 
around the streets of Tallinn have been stolen in West Europe. 
It seems there is currently a gang in Tallinn that has 
specialized in attacking owners of expensive luxury cars. As the 
car owner is walking to his vehicle, he is beaten up and his car 
keys are taken. The thieves then drive away with a new Volvo, 
Mercedes, or BMW.

<F P=106> [Article by Valdis Kiploks: "The Quiet, Merciless War: </F>
Sending Unarmed Soldiers into Combat is a Crime!"] 
  [Text] Valdis Kiploks continues his discussion of the 
disorder and even degradation in Latvia's defense organizations. 
At the center of attention: the Home Guard. But not it alone... 
  One must agree with Defense Forces Commander D. 
Turlais's statement that right now the threats to the 
independence and security of the Latvian state are greater than 
the ability to thwart them (interview in the newspaper LABRIT, 
26 January of this year, "A Running Officer Provokes Laughter in 
Peacetime".) Previously (RIGAS BALSS, 4 January) I wrote "The 
Quiet, Merciless War" about the growth in Russia's legal 
activities related to the withdrawal of military forces from our 
country. We must return to these themes yet again, first of all 
because the government has finally seemingly recognized the 
priority of national defense and also the Saeima has approved 
supplementary sums for these needs. But this money will provide 
only evil if serious endeavors are not undertaken to clean up 
defense organizations. 
  The complicated state defense system can be simplified in 
the 
classical way by thinking of it as a tiered fortress defense, in 
which the first line of defense is manned by diplomats, the 
second by ideology, the third by national industry; the fourth, 
though, is the fortress itself, that is the national military 
defense forces. If the first three lines of defense spend their 
time in uninterrupted struggles which the founder of military 
theory, Clausewitz, reminds us that peacetime is only imaginary, 
then defense forces in this time carry out only the role of 
catalyst. In an active battle they would be drawn in and their 
direct functions will be carried out only in time of military 
conflict, therefore in the event of final necessity, when the 
first three lines of defense have not achieved what is desired. 
Of course, the meaning and arrangement of these lines of defense 
varies from country to country. For example, in the 
over-militarized Russia, all defense is based almost entirely on 
the military complex and that dominates the diplomatic, 
psychological, industrial and other spheres. In such a country 
the diplomat Kozyrev or the politician Zirinovsky can afford to 
explore openly armed provocations; their national defense will 
not suffer from it, for that is guaranteed by a giant army, 
armed with weapons of mass destruction, and the consequences of 
their use scientists can only predict, but not precisely 
calculate. There are similar defense systems in all of the 
militarized great powers except Japan and Germany. The latter 
was not permitted by the victorious countries to develop a new 
Wehrmacht after its capitualation in 1945 and it now is 
seriously reviewing its defense doctrine. Similar defense issues 
are being resolved also in the war-vanquished Japan. 
  Such a model of defense, which was forced on Japan and 
Germany, but on smaller countries because of meager resources, 
cannot protect and they came to establish a total defense 
system, in which all lines of defense flowed together in a 
seemingly amorphous formation, though actually each 
insignificant basic organization is subordinated in coordinated 
action from one center. The exceptions are the defense forces, 
which stand as a discrete organization carrying out training, 
supply, and the aforementioned coordination functions. That is a 
description of an ideal type, in which there would not be also 
military defense forces, but all the country's defense problems 
would be resolved by "public defense," which was offered as an 
alternative to the military by Albert Einstein Institute senior 
researcher J. Sharp in his speech at the symposium, "New 
Thinking About European Security." (It is known in Latvia in an 
expanded version as the brochure, "Defense of Independent 
Countries Without War and Destruction.") But Mr. Sharp should 
have known that science and philosophy would permit such an 
ideal--absolute harmony--only as a momentary pause, after which 
the rapid slide downward begins, so that the concrete process 
begins anew, a difficult ascent, but of a different quality. And 
that is a sufficient basis to conclude that "public defense" 
alone can never be an alternative to a military. If we truly 
want to defend ourselves, then we can only go down this road of 
plenty and there is no alternative. 
  It becomes clear from the D. Turlais interview that Latvia 
still does not have a national defense doctrine, since the 
Defense Ministry must analyze potential threats to our country. 
But what should be the relationship between this analysis and 
the working out of the basic law on national defense? National 
defense cannot be implemented for just some individual event, 
but must be effective against any, often sudden and unforeseen 
type of attack. This defense force "umbrella law" must 
determine, according to a defense system developed according to 
some model, how we will arrive at the end result and how that 
will be integrated, first of all, with the Baltic states' mutual 
defense system. Two years have passed since the renewal of the 
country's independence. Yet, we still have no laws nor 
doctrines. But there have been no changes made in the 
composition of Defense Ministry personnel. And, if that has not 
yet been done, then there is a basis for thinking that in the 
Defense Ministry they are not exerting themselves by sitting on 
eggs that will never hatch, and that the empty nest-egg should 
be taken out. 
  But, if we are talking about threats to our national 
security, then it would be interesting to know the conclusions 
of such a competent analysis regarding which is more dangerous: 
the activities of Zhirinovsky's without political anesthesia, 
self-declared, Russian "Derzhavniki" [Statists], or 
the masked "Western expansion," and what might be the defense 
against each of these events? Everybody knows the facts about 
the transfer of many millions of dollars, which the Central 
Committee of the CPSU donated to the Communist parties they 
maintained in various countries, not to fund picnics, but to 
maintain the dirty deals and destructive actions connected with 
associated companies in these countries. But now, right in front 
of our eyes, innumerable foreign companies with dubious 
reputations are establishing here practically uncontrollable 
foreign joint ventures, including Russian and local 
self-seekers. And all of the negative by-products of this 
process show that the characteristics of those activities are 
the same as those for which some USSR Communist party paid such 
collosal sums in the West. Just on 10 January of this year the 
conflict in Riga's Vidzeme borough plainly showed that making 
contact with with such puzzling organizations will be much more 
dangerous than the Skrunda radar remaining and that a whorehouse 
established by some foreign country's military personnel (their 
existence at their respective addresses is news to the municipal 
authorities) could give rise to a military conflict fateful to 
the country. These facts alone already create the belief that 
our government's publicized "Western investment" in Latvia is 
nothing more than the same Communist money flooding in through 
the West. And the apparent sharp disagreement provoked by the 
East serves only to deflect attention from this, our country's 
truly dangerous process. Although in Russia it has been even 
officially announced that for political purposes gigantic sums 
will flood into Latvia. 
  It is clear that the delay in working out the basic law on 
national defense connects the Defense Forces commander and his 
actions in the work of the existing headquarters and creates 
chaos in subordination of defense forces, thereby directing them 
down the path of degradation. National defense cannot be 
developed today by fitting it to some personality or situational 
flow, but we must proceed in accordance with the law, in 
developing a concrete defense system. And we will immediately 
see where such unnecessary delay takes us. 
  Today it is clear to every somewhat thinking person that 
Latvia's defense cannot be ensured by barbed wire fences and 
minefields on the country's borders, nor could it be done with a 
Maginot or Mannerheim line. Only the aforementioned seemingly 
amorphous national total defense formation can create the threat 
of unacceptable casualties to an invader and cool the heads of 
warriors. If we accept that right now the worries about our 
security are directly related to Russia's behavior, then 
Russia's critical demographic characteristic right now still 
shows that the former popular and military mass is not there any 
more and so this factor cannot be depended on. 
  The most appropriate defense to develop in a modern state 
was 
the Home Guard. Correctly organized, well trained, armed and 
supplied, it could have become the basis for such a defense. But 
at that time, contrary to the accepted standards of defense 
development, it was not subordinated to the Defense Ministry and 
the supreme command of the Defense Forces. And what is happening 
there now? 
  In the training for the officers of the Riga Home Guard 
brigade in October, company commanders spent a whole week 
learning how to determine proper protocol for a completely woozy 
person, that it is humane to hit someone sleeping on the street 
in the nose, to make it bleed, because without bleeding and some 
apparent trauma medics simply will not take this person and he 
will freeze, and that car theft does not qualify as theft, 
because such a crime is missing an "objective side." They 
clarified still others of the Russian criminal code demagogic 
absurdities actually in force and the militia's acquired tricks. 
And such training is paid for, so, as was said on television, 
more will be carried out! 
  Theorists of revolutionary wars and practice prove that 
organizations established according to voluntary principles, 
such as our Home Guard, can have only one task: to protect the 
people and the country. Losing that, it disintegrates with the 
tendency of individual groupings to develop new or to integrate 
themselves with already existing criminal character 
organizations. Thus the world-renowned Italian mafia, "la Cosa 
Nostra," developed from the self-defense organizations of 
Sicily's inhabitants. Totalitarian regimes did not permit the 
existence of organized crime without state sanction (the coming 
into existence of those is one of the surest weaknesses of the 
regime and symptoms of imminent collapse), therefore after 
carrying out their assignment these organizations are simply 
liquidated. Thus totalitarian regimes liquidated the 
Oprichniki, the early Chekha, the 
Istrebiteli, Rem's Shturmoviki in Red 
Russia, and the Red Guards--the implementors of the "Cultural 
Revolution" in China. 
  This same destruction theory and practice is safely and 
effectively used by psychological warfare specialists and 
parallel to the chief task in these organizations or popular 
movements with patriotic motivation brings in some side 
assignment or responsibility. With that division, the 
organization is innoculated with the virus and its movement in 
the main direction is practically halted. A glaring example of 
this sort of invasion is found in the actions of the Supreme 
Council, etc. 
  The people who joined the Home Guard were patriots, and in 
the beginning it was organized to protect Latvia's independence. 
But now at such a critical time to the country, it is obviously 
being shifted to carrying out police auxilliary service 
functions! Thus, it is on the road to degradation and 
disintegration! 
  One of the characteristics of revolutionary war tactics, to 
influence the enemy in the most painful way possible, is the 
fourth thesis formulated by Mao Zedong: "Concentrate in every 
battle on superior enemy forces." This thesis must be understood 
to mean that by pretending to rob banks, telegraph centrals and 
other objects one achieves their stationary guard. And, the more 
objects that are guarded, and the larger numerically are the 
guard units, the more beneficial the situation will be for the 
attackers. A well-planned operation in such an instance will 
involve a numerically small, well-prepared group of men, who can 
destroy many numerically large guard units in a few hours. 
Working out countermeasures to such tactics the German military 
specialist E. Vorwerk wrote: "One must have the perimeters of 
objects guarded by those who have a stake in saving the country. 
For the most part the existing protected objects and sensitive 
points must be locked together in object groups, which are close 
together, and they must be protected by roving patrols, but at 
irregular times." 
  And what is our Home Guard occupied with right now? Chiefly 
with the stationary protection of companies able to pay to 
protect themselves! It is hard to believe that that is out of 
ignorance or circumstance; it is more logical to conclude that 
the Home Guard is deliberately being prepared in conformance 
with the aforementioned scheme or even without pretend robberies 
and noises, with the help of the same aforementioned Communist 
party money. 
  An increase in funding from the state budget for the Home 
Guard in such a situation will only promote it as the collapse 
of the national defense organizations. And that is why it is 
without resistance subordinated to the Defense Ministry and the 
Defense Forces command, no matter how powerless and undeveloped 
this ministry is right now. The experience of Lithuania and 
Estonia is that with such a merging of defense forces protests 
from some Home Guard commanders or even units could be 
anticipated. But that will only prove that it is not in their 
own personal interest to subordinate themselves to anyone and it 
will clearly show how productive were the activities of the 
rotting invaders of the the Home Guard. 
  Both the Defense Forces and the Home Guard still are short 
of 
weapons. We are talking here about the most basic soldier's 
armaments: mortars, grenades, machine guns, automatic rifles, 
flame throwers, etc. That must be labeled as particularly 
illogical because producing these weapons is simple in reality. 
The experience of war indicates that producing them without 
particular difficulty can be begun in a week's time wherever 
there are general-purpose metalworking tables. Latvia has enough 
specialists and all the prerequisites for light weapon 
production. In its place they open a monopoly company store, 
where Home Guardsmen must use their personal resources to 
acquire pistols and carbines, but not the automatic weapons 
needed for defending the country. In addition, even these 
limited arms end up in the hands of civilians who have money and 
a personal interest. No one in the government has shown any 
interest in weapons so essential to national defense, such as 
mortars, grenades and automatic rifles, and none of the Riga 
Home Guard batallions have any of that. One must must be 
severely limited to be unable to understand what kind of 
policies and from what quarters it comes! 
  Production and sale of battlefield weapons is one of the 
most 
profitable businesses in any country and in the current 
situation it cannot be allowed to be managed by a private 
company. Such action will permit store proprietors to skim off 
public money intended for national defense needs into their own 
pockets, and state control over this branch would be lost. 
  The battle readiness of the army, including the Home Guard, 
is determined by three factors. "If one of them is zero or only 
at a low level, then the level of battle readiness, irrespective 
of the strength of the other indicators, will not exceed the 
level of the lowest factor. Therefore, if the army is not armed, 
then the remaining determinants of battle readiness cannot save 
you." For the sake of clarity in his interview Mr. Turlais 
should have expressed this axiom to its end, that is, "A 
government that sends into battle unarmed soldiers, is a 
criminal one." 
  Completely puzzling in the interview are the Defense Forces 
commander's statements about the functions of the Defense 
Ministry, it activities and his relationship with this 
institution. In reality and also in essence, the Defense Forces 
commander also is a member of the government and democracy would 
not tolerate it if the supreme commander would also be the 
Minister and the Defense Ministry did not exist. The division of 
power principle would not change by that. Defense ministries 
were established in the highly organized countries to free 
defense force commanders from all the ancillary duties, such as 
supplies, finance and other similar questions and so they coiuld 
effectively resolve only one assignment: the military defense of 
the country. In addition, by establishing a total model of 
national defense, all civilian spheres are included and the 
defense ministry must resolve problems associated with it. Here, 
too, issues of a military character remain within the competence 
of the supreme commander. One can imagine what kind of defense 
that would be in war time, if military operations were planned 
by a civilian ministry and the commander received those plans 
the evening before the battle. 
  In his ignorance the staggering officer will be no better 
than the running one to whom D. Turlais referred. And, freeing 
ourselves from Soviet thinking, we must still understand how to 
avoid falling into the trench of helplessness. The Defense 
Forces commander is and must be the person who has the final 
word in all military questions, within the national defense 
policy confines determined by the Saeima and Constitution, of 
course. And such a commander will have the recognition and 
support of the people.

<F P=106> [Interview of Security Forces Commander Juris Vectirans by </F>
Andris Jakubans and Eriks Hanbergs: "Juris Vectirans--Only to 
Andris Jakubans and Eriks Hanbergs"] 
  [Text] 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] You are the leader of the type of agency 
that appears dangerous to some, and maybe even ready for the 
dustbin. Therefore, the first question is quite simple: How many 
times have you been shot at? 
  [Vectirans] I remember the last time quite well. It was New 
Year's. My brother-in-law. With a champagne cork. 
  But, seriously, there have been critical situations, of 
course. I served in the militia; in the Internal Affairs 
Ministry my work was connected with examining criminal activity 
at various levels. I have been shot at, but, thank God, never 
been hit. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] What is the feeling at that moment, when 
the bullet goes past? 
  [Vectirans] It is, of course, not pleasant. I heard the most 
buzzing bullets in January of '91. Back then I was carrying out 
the duties of the deputy commander of the government guard 
service. In carrying out my responsibilities there occured a 
contact with OMON troops. When the takeover of the Internal 
Affairs Ministry occured I found myself at the Cabinet of 
Ministers building. From there I repeatedly went to ministry 
building to evaluate the situation and to resolve it. Bullets 
whined past; but I did not act like a hero, either in the 
classical nor in any different sense, when I did what I had to 
do, and that's all. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] But you are not like the "Brave Soldier 
Shweek?" 
  [Vectirans] Certainly not, although I like very much this 
Haek character. I have found that book again, so that I could 
read it again. It often occurs to me that a colonel in the 
Latvian army is injured more than in the Soviet times, being a 
Soviet officer. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] In the days of the barricades [January 
1991 
and later] someone wrote on the Riga railway station platform, 
in Russian: Let's Hang Vectirans! 
  [Vectirans] Ha! I guess those who wrote it didn't do as well 
with the rope! 
  Of course, my connection to the events of the time of 
Awakening was close. Those years in my life are the brightest 
and remain best in my memory. Of course I am not thinking about 
my personal life, since the birth of my second daughter in '89 
also was a huge event in my life; as a rank and file member of 
the Popular Front I obeyed my leader, Dainis Ivans, in his 
appeal to enrich Latvian families. 
  Yes, time of Awakening was rich in events. We began to 
organize volunteer police formations in the self-defense units. 
That functioned successfully and for some time, causing alarm on 
the side of the imperial defenders. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] The public seems to know you well, but 
they 
would certainly like to know even more. 
  [Vectirans] I was born in '53. October. In a good time, 
after 
the death of the despot Stalin. My generation must work off the 
difficulties of that time, to develop Latvia into a powerful 
country. 
  I was born in Zemgale, in the famous port city of 
Jaunjelgava, into a provincial intelligentsia family. I studied 
there until I turned 18, then I enrolled in the army college, 
but due to circumstances I ended up in active military service. 
I served in the USSR Internal Affairs Ministry's special 
motorized militia unit. I ended my service in Riga as a 
sergeant, group commander. 
  Then there was work in the ranks of the Internal Affairs 
Ministry posts, teaching in the militia school and in the USSR 
Internal Affairs Ministry school in Lviv. I also finished at the 
Higher School of the Internal Affairs Ministry. Various 
promotions, courses, also highest academics in Kiev. 
  Among other things, I arrived in Ukraine at the end of May 
'90, so from a country that had declared its independence from 
the USSR. I was accepted with understanding, well-treated, 
perhaps also because of my personal characteristics, as my 
country's representatives, as a Latvian officer. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] We have it on good authority that you have 
in your house an historical sword and that your ancestors were 
policemen. 
  [Vectirans] I have many swords, but the one to which you are 
referring is unique. It belonged to one of our relatives, a 
cavalryman who was awarded the Order of Lacplesis, third class. 
He managed to save himself from the repressions, perhaps because 
he de-mobilized from the army in '33. 
  I have read in his documents, by the way, that Latvian 
officers in the Tsar's army declared their support for the 
establishment of the Latvian state. And these officers wore a 
ribbon in the colors of the flag of Latvia on their uniforms, 
thereby publicly displaying their stand. To join the ranks of 
the Latvian army, an affadavit from several colleagues in the 
service was required, attesting to the person's having 
demonstrated a nationalist orientation. (I, too, when I assumed 
the post of First Police Battalion commander, was strongly 
vetted in a meeting; they took into account sponsor affadavits, 
although I was the Internal Affairs Ministry's senior cadre 
officer with 17 years of service.) 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] How did your path as a Popular Fronter 
start? 
  [Vectirans] I participated in meetings and the like, along 
with my wife and oldest daughter. I wanted to be together with 
my people, to feel the oneness. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Did you arrive as a private person or as 
an 
officer? 
  [Vectirans] Back then I was an Internal Affairs service 
officer and the uniform was military: the uniform of a USSR army 
officer. It was just by accident that I did not have to stand in 
the human chain at the Monument of Freedom and interfere with 
the right of the Latvian people to honor our most sacred symbol. 
For that I am thankful to fate, for I cannot even imagine how 
much strength it would have required within me to fail to carry 
out the order of the commander of the day. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Yes, it was a time when many militiamen 
had 
a moment to examine their consciences. 
  [Vectirans] Many militia workers have told me about their 
feelings at that time. But many carried out their duties at the 
Monument of Freedom back then with great joy. But we all will 
have our time to be sifted into history's granaries and we each 
will receive our judgment. 
  My daughter was a student in the nineth grade in the First 
High School of Jelgava, and I joined the Popular Front group at 
this school, with the teachers. My comrades in the service knew 
little of this. But my stand was clear to them. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Have you met with your service comrades 
from that time? 
  [Vectirans] My current service duties are such that I do 
have 
the opportunity to meet former, I do not want to call them all 
comrades, but more often colleagues. We understand 
one another, and we do not have many disagreements, if we are 
not talking about the most important things. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Perhaps you have arrested some of them, 
the 
former ones. 
  [Vectirans] Only Parmyonov was arrested and tried. There is 
not a single document which at least analyzes the activities of 
those Internal Affairs Ministry workers who were involved in 
supporting the imperial system, their actions, inactions or 
offered assistance in the dramatic events of that time, when the 
existence of the Latvian state was decided. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] But still, you as Security Agency leader 
have such a balance, of course? 
  [Vectirans] Hmmm. Many think that the Security Agency 
operates like the one-time KGB, but that is not so. Our 
functions include protection of the highest officials, receiving 
foreign delegations and guaranteeing their security, guarding 
embassies and other nationally significant objects, and, of 
course, operational activities to ensure all of that. 
  But, if you refer in your question to activities against 
elements, organizations hostile to the Latvian state, then I can 
say that there are no specific national policies on this issue. 
There is completely uncoordinated information collection by 
various state organizations. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] How was it that the Internal Affairs 
Ministry was unable to locate Mr. Rucs, while your Security 
Agency men did so without a problem? 
  [Vectirans] There was nothing illusory or abstract in that 
situation. Everyone acted much more simply and prosaically than 
perhaps might be imagined, but not simply. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Was [Internal Affairs Minister] Girts 
Kristovskis jealous of you for such a turn of events? 
  [Vectirans] I think that Girts is not trampled down by this 
character flaw common among some men. And in this event there 
was no basis for jealousy. We joined the operation at the 
direction of the President, but the successful conclusion was 
determined by both the Agency's specific character and by the 
prevalence of good contacts with all organizations. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] I once read this conclusion in the history 
of assassination attempts: in the de Gaulle era French security 
agency workers trained in America, but remained faithful to 
their system and boasted that they guarded de Gaulle, but not 
the American Kennedy. Where are your workers trained? What do 
your people gather from international experience? 
  [Vectirans] We are constantly improving ourselves. I, too, 
even though I have a degree with the highest legal education and 
experience working in the Internal Affairs Ministry. I have 
studied in many courses which were organized at the request of 
our government by foreign specialists, but we must continue to 
improve our model. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] You were also trained in America. How did 
the American service and police differ? 
  [Vectirans] We acquired experience in a similar service, 
which makes arrangements for national leaders, the top official, 
organizing a representative task. These jobs, you can say, have 
a visible part that looks similar, two or three strapping men 
walking with the person being guarded, but of course there is a 
whole complex range of tasks being performed, which are carried 
out by other particular agencies. The experiences I acquired in 
America come in handy. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Those who have seen the famous film 
"Bodyguard" for the first time completely understand how 
complicated this profession is. 
  [Vectirans] And they were also convinced of how unsuccessful 
it is, if it is not connected with the other services. The 
success or lack of success in guarding people is always directly 
dependent on the other security agencies. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Your's are strong? 
  [Vectirans] Developed, but not to the point that we could 
say 
that in this area nothing more needs to be done. 
  The one-time KGB carried out their job well and effectively 
enough. The Soviet era personal protection system was only a 
small part of the totalitarian regime's system, which ensured 
its existence. Now a few journalists wonder why nothing was seen 
before, but now suddenly it is seen! We must remember that that 
system carried out complete scrutiny and control of society, 
both spectators and the composition of people's groups were 
given out in doses. Even in May Day demonstrations marchers were 
specially selected from factories. 
  My wife told me that at VEF they consciensciously selected 
marchers. Those who did not carry out this task were not 
permitted at the demonstrations the next time. Yes, the KGB, 
which in principle managed public opinion, actively operated in 
factories and the larger enterprises. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Does such a system also operate now? 
  [Vectirans] No. But still, caution is necessary. We actively 
cooperate with government institutions with similar functions, 
with the Internal Affairs and Defense ministries, with the Home 
Guard. The successful conclusion to the Pope's visit was 
attributable to our agency, the aforementioned department, of 
all the country and, I will not be particularly bashful if I 
mention to a certain extent also my modest contribution. The 
stress of preparing for that was terrific, a big job was carried 
out, and everything, with the Lord's help, succeeded as 
befitting, not to mention that the level of threat was 
sufficient. That is proof that the country's security system is 
functioning. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Our photographers were not satisfied with 
being permitted to photograph the Pope only from a great 
distance. That was not just the caprice of the press this time; 
this visit was a distinguished event in Latvian history. 
  [Vectirans] Mmm, yes. There will always be someone who is 
dissatisfied, including journalists. We tried to take into 
account their wishes also, of course, for the closer they got to 
the Pope, the closer they wanted to get. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] The successful security for the Pope's 
visit truly was your agency's most satisfying hour. Afterwords 
the press reported that Vectirans was walking around with a 
smile on his face. But how did you yourself perceive the arrival 
of such a high-ranking person? 
  [Vectirans] The groundwork was done very carefully, the 
stress is considerable, but there is satisfaction after 
successful visits. The Pope's visit was unique, leaving me with 
a deep personal impression. Finding myself next to the Holy 
Father, that was a unique event for me. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] What are your contacts with those security 
agencies which escort high-ranking officials here? 
Psychological, practical? 
  [Vectirans] In August '91, after the Putsch events, when 
Russian Federation leader Yeltsin found himself in Latvia, and 
that was kept secret, our Security Agency also participated in 
protecting him. The situation had not yet been completely 
resolved, and therefore was stressful; we were in full combat 
readiness. Yeltsin's bodyguards were significantly better 
equipped than we were. We adopted their recommendations in a 
business-like way. 
  We have always had collegial relations with our 
brothers-in-arms, although, for instance, the Americans really 
have a lot to be proud of (we, too, have no shortage of pride, 
either), a high level of professionalism, sufficient autonomy to 
resolve our questions. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Did you communicate in English? 
  [Vectirans] Yes, quite successfully, using a translator. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] In Latvia arguments have flashed up over 
independence, subordination, and cooperation, also regarding the 
Security Agency. How independent are you? To whom are you 
subordinated? With whom do you cooperate? How much are you 
permitted to say about all that? Also about those altogether 
behind-the-scenes brawls? 
  [Vectirans] I would say that real battles happen, not just 
brawls! I probably do not even know all of it, but that is a 
matter for the politicians who must after all heed our 
professional viewpoints to develop a model appropriate to 
Latvia. The Security Agency grew out of the First Police 
Battalion, which appeared as part of the Internal Affairs 
Ministry and was the first national armed organization. In the 
time of Awakening it was a strikingly national unit. During the 
August Putsch the battalion succeeded in escaping physical 
losses (but not material ones), maintained itself as an 
organizatio and developed; the Supreme Council's guard service 
was established, and autonomous, independent organization which 
later was transformed into the Security Agency. We are a 
constituent part of the National Armed Forces. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Who is your commander? 
  [Vectirans] The Security Agency is subordinated to the 
President of Latvia as the Commander in Chief of the National 
Armed Forces. We actively cooperate with the other organizations. 
  Yes, but rumors the reorganization of the Security Agency 
are 
not without basis. Once the Internal Affairs Ministry was viewed 
as stagnant and a program was worked out to reorganize it. The 
Security Agency needed to secure a bloc more connected to state 
sovereignty, but the Internal Affairs Ministry was in its direct 
competence, the battle against crime and so forth. Now we, who 
have proven by our actions that we are powers faithful to the 
Latvian state are being reformed. Still, reforms are necessary 
in all of the system. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Perhaps because you are working too well? 
  [Vectirans] If it were only so, then I could answer the 
question differently. The classical variant has been 
established: the Internal Affairs Ministry, the Defense 
Ministry, the Home Guard (a new organization, which they may 
also grab hold of and liquidate soon?). The job is done 
energetically. Security Police are foreseen within the Internal 
Affairs Ministry. All that's left is to wish them well in 
actively working to protect Latvia's sovereignty! 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] But still, what is your view of the way in 
which we should move in this instance? 
  [Vectirans] The country must have permanent service with the 
task of carrying out a complex variety of tasks, including 
special ones, to guard the independence of the state of Latvia, 
the people's freedom. These last words must be the guiding motto 
of this service. 
  Our organization's work could be included within this 
complex. In no way can it be found within the Internal Affairs 
Ministry, at least in the near term. It [the Internal Affairs 
Minstry] already now carries on operations, inquiries and 
investigations inside and outside the country's territory; it 
has prisons and its own army subordinated to it. All that it is 
missing is its own judiciary, and then it would be a complete 
model of Stalin's Security Ministry. That would be dangerouis to 
the Republic of Latvia, to the renewal of democracy. I have 
already expressed my ideas to the President, the Prime Minister, 
and the Chairman of the Saeima. 
  We must bring into order the penal (prisons) system and 
subordinate it to the Justice Ministry, investigations to the 
Procuracy and the financial police to the Finance Ministry, to 
decentralize powers of repression. The powers of repression are 
particularly unacceptable if the Internal Affairs Ministry is 
led by politicians, who, whether they want to or not, more or 
less, will be led by their party interests. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] You were one of those who arrested 
[Communist Party Secretary Alfreds] Rubiks after the Putsch, 
placing irons on his arms... 
  [Vectirans] No, I determined that, evaluating the situation 
as a professional, that it was not necessary to place this 
person in irons. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Among other things the Generals were 
complaining that the irons placed on Mr. Rucs scraped his upper 
arms. 
  [Vectirans] Mr. Rucs is a leader in the civilian 
administrator and perhaps he has different rules and regulations 
than we soldiers. 
  Yes, but regarding the arrest of Rubiks I can tell you 
plainly only that I cannot say much, because the legal 
proceedings are continuing and I have not yet given my testimony. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] It is clear how you two met on that August 
day, but at least tell us about how you parted back then! 
  [Vectirans] Rather lyrically. Yes, there were certain 
emotions and not negative ones alone. That day was very 
turbulent overall. While we were still in the former [Communist] 
party central committee building, we received information that 
OMON was preparing to arrive, to liberate the building and those 
arrested in it. We arrested Rubiks are were preparing to leave 
in a mostly unknown direction. Even I had in mind a certain 
place, but at the last moment we ended up in another. In 
addition, it was 23 August, a very significant day to the 
Latvian people [anniversary of the signing of the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]. I also wanted to be together with 
everyone elst at the Monument of Freedom, and we were hurrying. 
There were several incidents. Yes, perhaps some day I will be 
able to talk about it all more deeply. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] In the Ulmanis era, it turned out that 
Latvia was a diplomatic and spying center. Are there any 
espionage services operating? Is the government able to control 
it at all? It sometimes seems that the Russian service operates 
completely in the open. 
  [Vectirans] I must be circumspect in what a I say. In 
general 
I could say this: Questions must be resolved more quickly about 
the withdrawal of the Russian army in planned steps, for that is 
connected with handing over certain positions (in a secret way) 
in the tossed-off territory. If we can do it that way, then why 
not withdraw? Some sort of planning can be seen. Would positions 
be sufficiently strengthened? There is food for thought here. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Could a secret police be established in 
Latvia? 
  [Vectirans] In the era of Latvia there were the secret 
police, the political administration and the security police. 
Three different names, but in reality the Internal Affairs 
Ministry political administration. 
  Among other things I can say that the are no [former] 
Chekhists working in the political administration of Latvia. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] Was Fridriksons a shining personality? 
  [Vectirans] Other countries used the fruits of his labors. 
His workers were in other institutions, carrying out collosal 
work. I think that Latvia must remember its patriots, such as 
these Fridriksons people. 
  The practice of the special services of other countries is 
to 
utilize professionals for the benefit of the state. And done 
correctly. Latvia is not so rich to throw around professionals. 
Another thing, I do not think that, for instance, Dzerzhinsky's 
students would operate in the Latvian political adminstration. 
Please, God, save us from Dzerzhinsky's grandchildren 
working in our security police! 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] How is it with the selection of personnel? 
What are the principles for selection? How does one become 
persuaded that such grandchildren of Dzerzhinsky will 
not be able to infiltrate? Can you think about that and sleep 
peacefully at night? 
  [Vectirans] I am not tormented by sleeplessness; the agency 
has accustomed me to sleeping in any manner. But Latvia is not 
to the point where Vectirans can sleep peacefully. 
  The first and most important criterion for choosing 
personnel 
is loyalty to the Latvian state. Also professional fitness and 
preparation, of course, but the determining factor is whether 
this person is a Latvian patriot. In my opinion the approach to 
it is still overly superficial, formal. Although for me as a 
soldier, the survival of the Latvian state, speaking without 
particular emotion, is a matter of honor. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] In selecting employees have you sometimes 
made mistakes? 
  [Vectirans] Unfortunately, yes. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] What do you do with them? Deport them? 
  [Vectirans] There are various methods. Generally I am led by 
the interests of the agency and the demands of the situation, 
based on the law. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] What do you do in instances of 
imcompatiblity? 
  [Vectirans] That has happened and it is a specific 
circumstance. The mutual compatibility of people in carrying out 
the agency's duties is very important. If that is missing then 
the problem must be resolved in an ethically correct way. 
Everyone must understand that protection is not necessary just 
for its own sake, but because the bodyguard carries out duties 
important to the state and our duty is to secure them, correctly 
and inconspicuously. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] There are many military units in Riga and 
every company has its own security service. The rackets are 
operating. The disorder in this area appears dangerous. Are you 
on top of the situation? 
  [Vectirans] Being concerned with personal protection, 
companies hope that they will thereby be guaranteed security. 
But personal protection does not guarantee that, if there is no 
security and order in the country, if every citizen's security 
is not guaranteed. We cannot depend on the successes of 
individual guards until the state ensures law and order. 
  [NEATKARIGA CINA] What are you by nature: an optimist or a 
pessimist? 
  [Vectirans] It is a very hard time for Latvia right now. We 
are standing at the crossroads--perhaps it is out country's 
fate, always to be at the crossroads. But still, I as a 
Christian person, also know that we must do everything possible 
so that we again have order here. And I also know that IT WILL 
BE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT IT WILL BE GOOD. One hundred 
percent! I will even swear to it with my signature!

<F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "Jurkans Founds Peoples' Accord </F>
Party"] 
  [Text] Riga, 6 February--Some of the deputies of the Accord 
for Latvia faction in the Saeima joined others of the same 
political views in founding the Peoples' Accord Party (PNS) 
Saturday on the Latvian University campus. A party program and 
charter and several resolutions were adopted at the congress. 
Janis Jurkans was installed as party chairman. The founders of 
the PNS will continue to work in the Accord for Latvia faction 
in the Saeima. 
  The party constituent congress was attended by Saeima 
deputies Andris Ameriks and Igors Bukovskis, and the party 
declaration was also signed by Lyudmila Kupriyanova. The PNS was 
founded on the basis of the Latvian Support Fund. Some of the 
Accord for Latvia deputies who were not involved in the 
establishment of the PNS--Edvins Kide, Juris Janeks, Yevgeniy 
Zashcherinskiy, Vilnis Edvins Bresis, and Janis Lucans--will 
form their own party at the end of March and join the National 
Economy and Prosperity bloc. The programs of the two groups will 
continue to agree with the platform of the Accord for Latvia and 
Recovery for the National Economy bloc. When Saeima Deputy Igors 
Bukovskis addressed the congress, he said there was no split in 
the faction. It was simply that the bolder members were quicker 
to form their own party. He expressed the hope that the other 
deputies in the faction would join the PNS soon. 
  Forty people voted in favor of the creation of the PNS at a 
general meeting, including Mavriks Vulfsons, Nikolajs Nejlands, 
Juris Rozenvalds, Ilze Jurkane, Ivars Kezbers, Vladlens 
Dozorcevs, and Janis Aboltins. 
  One of the authors of the party program, Juris Rozenvalds, 
remarked at the congress that the PNS would take a centrist 
stance, would support the market economy and the development of 
entrepreneurial activity, and would defend the active voting 
rights of residents in local elections. 
  In his opinion, the PNS's closest neighbors in the spectrum 
of political parties are the Democratic Party, the Democratic 
Party of Labor, and the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party. 
  The PNS program advocates the election of the president of 
the state by all of the people, calls for the unity of the 
Latvian public, and requests the Saeima to pass a declaration on 
ethnic and social reconciliation. The PNS believes that people 
who have lived in Latvia for the last 10 years and have a 
conversational knowledge of the Latvian language are entitled to 
citizenship, but preference in the granting of citizenship 
should be given to permanent residents who were born in Latvia 
(with the exception of foreign servicemen on active duty and 
their descendants) and the family members of citizens of the 
Latvian Republic. The PNS recommends that the naturalization of 
non-citizens start as soon as possible. 
  The PNS sees Latvia's main foreign policy objective as the 
normalization of relations with Russia and other CIS countries. 
The economic section of the PNS program expresses support for 
the market economy, as well as for the state as the largest 
owner of capital and the coexistence of various forms of 
entrepreneurial activity.

<F P=106> [Article by Rita Nasheniyetse: "With Narcotics to Europe; </F>
The Baltic Today is an Ideal Place for Transit of Narcotics"] 
  [Text] In September of 1993, the police in Olayne 
confiscated 8 kilograms of amphetamine pills. This was the 
paltry remnants of the Olayne "goods" which several years ago 
filled Europe. Around half of the amphetamines which ended up in 
the hands of the English police came from Latvia. There are 
hardly any other Latvian goods which are so abundantly 
represented abroad. However, the production of amphetamines is 
not our largest contribution to the international drug trade. 
<H5>  Latvia is integrating </H5>
  From the territory of the Near and Middle East, where opium 
and narcotics of the cannabis group are produced, from the 
countries of the golden crescent--Iran, Pakistan and 
Afghanistan--the goods, according to tradition, were sent to 
Europe along a relatively short transit route through Turkey, 
the Balkans, Greece and other Mediterranean Sea countries. At 
the present time, the transport of narcotics has been shifted 
closer to the northern boundaries. Crossing the CIS countries, 
shipments of drugs make a huge circle and are re-routed in the 
direction of the Baltic. 
  The "goods" from Russia, the Transcaucasus and the southern 
republics of the former USSR also come through the Baltic 
(primarily through Latvia with its three ports). Narcotics 
intended for the Scandinavian countries are brought in from 
Poland. 
  Also not excluded is the particularly exotic transit (from 
some African country) or through Russia and the Far East from 
South America. The Baltic today is the ideal place for the 
transit of narcotics. A wonderful geographic position in 
combination with weakly guarded borders, an increasing influence 
of organized crime, legislation which has not yet been regulated 
and clearly expressed corruption have become the reasons why 
narcotics have begun to be distributed along the channels in the 
direction of the Baltic with an ever increasing intensity. 
<H5>  Latvia as a market for narcotics </H5>
  "Latvia as a market for narcotics does not yet have 
particular significance, but it does play a very important role 
in the transit of narcotics," says the deputy chief of the Main 
Police Administration of the city of Riga, Vilnis Kipens. Mr. 
Kostenko from the 6th section of the police department also 
agrees with him. However, this certainly does not mean that the 
drug business here is not a profitable endeavor. Such a point of 
view was expressed in the newspaper TEV in the issue for 15 
November 1993: "As strange as it may seem, the profits of the 
mafia obtained from trade in narcotics in Latvia are not great. 
As compared with the developed countries, the consumption of 
these substances here is rather insignificant. Therefore, trade 
in them is entrusted to dealers of a lower level--obviously, 
under the condition that they regularly hand over the 
appropriate part of their income to their bosses." 
  Trade in narcotics at street "points," perhaps, does not 
make 
an impression. However, this is merely the "enterprise" of small 
dealers who, in turn, rely on "wholesalers"--large dealers who 
rarely catch the attention of the police and are almost never 
detained by them. 
  Approximately 1,000 laty worth of goods pass through the 
hands of the large dealers in a 24-hour period. A large dealer 
always has at least 20 kilograms of poppy straw on hand, several 
liters of "khitkhanki" (raw opium--raw material for production 
of heroin, which is also used in the form of a semi-finished 
product) or goods which are analogous in their "value." Large 
dealers do not stand at the very top of the pyramid in the 
narcotics trade. They may conditionally be called the second 
degree workers in this business. 
  As to where the monetary relations with organized crime lead 
subsequently, we can only conjecture. We should remember that in 
Latvia the source of profit has become specifically 
transit, and the "informals" will certainly not let 
anything of theirs slip away. Although we must also remember 
than part of the goods pass them by. Although the drug business 
is that sphere of activity in which the representatives of 
organized crime find a common language, for some the possibility 
of getting a higher profit seems too tempting. 
<H5>  Couriers in the drug business </H5>
  The most significant moment in the work of the narcotics 
transporter--the courier--is to bring the goods over the border. 
The "spectrum" of courier cadres at the present time is rather 
broad--from "specialists" to drug addicts engaging in transport 
at their own fear and risk. During the operation of "closing" 
the channel for transporting drugs which connected Lithuania and 
Latvia, a family was detained which was transporting across the 
border drugs hidden in the diapers of an infant. 
  However, a trained courier does not travel holding a bag of 
hashish in his hands. The transport of narcotics may be 
organized with the aid of train conductors, locomotive 
engineers, long-distance truck drivers or aircraft pilots. In 
these cases, the courier merely provides the transport for 
shipment of the goods from one place to another, settles 
accounts with the sellers and arranges all necessary matters. 
  A more complex form is also practiced, when one other 
person--a manager--participates in the transport of the drugs. 
If the shipment is especially large or if new business contacts 
are being established, the negotiations at one end or the other, 
as well as the monetary arrangements, are handled by the 
manager. In this case, the courier is responsible for the 
technical aspect--to organize the transport. With the 
"specialization" of the drug business in Eastern Europe and the 
CIS countries, couriers are also becoming professionals. At the 
present time, the number of those couriers which themselves use 
drugs is declining. Among them you will rarely find those who 
use weak drugs for a prolonged period of time, or those whose 
bosses force them to refuse narcotics. A good courier is more 
valuable than gold. He is considered a small but necessary 
detail in the mechanism of the large-scale drug business. 
<H5>  Once again about the border </H5>
  Opinions vary as to what percentage of the drugs which are 
brought in are detained at the border. In any case, this is a 
trifle. Foreign experts in combatting the drug trade believe 
that at the moment of import-export, only about 5-6 percent of 
the amount of drugs brought in are actually confiscated in the 
West European countries. Nevertheless, it is specifically the 
border which is the place where the struggle of any state with 
the drug trade begins. A regulated border has not only the 
inspection and detainment of cargo and documents, but also a 
well-ordered system of information. Today there is no precise 
information about who is crossing the border and for what 
purpose. 
  A Bureau on Combatting Narcotics will soon be created in 
Latvia. At the present time, it is presumed that it will employ 
at least 30 persons. But perhaps this is not the indicator which 
we should consider as being decisive, determining the 
effectiveness of the work. Perhaps a more significant indicator 
is the measure to which its work will be supported by the state 
in a financial and juridical sense (with the aid of 
legislation). Ultimately, this is a question of prestige--how 
long will Latvia serve as the window to Europe? A broken window, 
through which anyone who wants to can climb. 
<H5>  Not only oaks grow in the Baltic </H5>
  Opium poppies grow there too. The road to bright capitalism 
has had a heavy impact on the financial situation of the 
peasants. Neither the raising of livestock, nor grain growing 
bring them a decent income. Therefore, they are trying to make a 
living by growing poppies. What areas specifically are taken up 
by them, it is hard to say. However, in Lithuania, where this 
trade has become rather popular, law enforcement workers in 1993 
confiscated around 1 tonne of poppy straw of local production. 
It has been learned from certain unofficial sources that part of 
the opium poppy straw was brought in from Ukraine or from 
Lithuania. Latvia also strives to make its "contribution" to the 
field of poppy raising. The residents of Talsinskiy Rayon worked 
particularly well last year in this regard. 
  Aleksandr Kostenko, chief of the group for combatting drugs 
of the Riga police department's section for combatting organized 
crime, believes that Latvia should seriously undertake the 
struggle against growing narcotics raw material, returning to 
the control measures which were popular in the early 80's. 
  We might add that the opium poppies grown in the northern 
regions are especially highly valued by drug dealers due to 
their prolonged storage time. 
<H3>  The community does not realize the full measure of danger-- 
So says Modris Krishyanis, deputy chief of the 7th Section of 
the Main Police Administration in the city of Riga. "We in 
Latvia have not yet realized the danger which threatens us. 
Today it seems to us that nothing terrible is happening, but 
this is the calm before the storm. Abroad, even acetone is 
strictly accounted for as a raw material for production of 
narcotics: Its transport, storage and application are under the 
strictest control. Yet here in our country one can buy narcotics 
at the drug store. 'Solutan,' which has become a very popular 
medicine in Latvia, and which is prescribed even for children, 
contains ephedrine, which is classed as a stimulant. A drug 
addict needs 6-7 cubic centimeters of this substance, yet from 
two bottles of 'solutan' one can get 22 cubic centimeters. All 
this is perfectly well known both to doctors and pharmacists, 
but if a person gets 30 laty a month, he can yield to temptation 
and write a prescription for money or issue the medication for a 
counterfeit prescription." </H3>
  "Very many drug addicts want to get treatment. However, the 
medical institutions in Latvia have allotted only 70 beds for 
this purpose." 
  "At the present time, a drug market is being born in Latvia. 
'Ladies' narcotics--ephedrine and other 'mild' pills, which have 
become popular among the young people, in fact create a base for 
the use of strong narcotics in the future." 
<H5>  Narcotics--a tool for manipulation </H5>
  Apartment robberies, store hold-ups, assaults in the 
street--these are all methods for desperate drug addicts to get 
money. A glass of pulverized poppy straw costs 4 laty. Young 
girls who offer their bodies for sale in the street, as well as 
certain "call girls," are puppets in the hands of their pimps. 
They have been "hooked." They are totally dependant on the next 
dose of ephedrine (a narcotic which increases the sex drive) or 
heroin. This is almost the only way in which the owner settles 
accounts with such girls. 
  Businessmen, as a rule, try to stay away from narcotics. 
  Nevertheless, a substance for entertaining "higher 
society"--cocaine powder--has appeared in Latvia. This is an 
expensive thing. Cocaine is brought in by transit route from 
Russia (through the Far East, from South America) or from 
Western Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by Anda Mikelsone: "Two People Were Murdered Each </F>
Day Last Year"] 
  [Text] Riga, 17 February--According to the unverified data 
of the Ministry of Welfare's Health Department, the death rate 
in Latvia last year was much higher than it had been in 1992 
(3,787 more deaths last year than in 1992), and so was the 
number of suicides and murders. There was an average of two 
murders and three suicides each day last year. Brigita Everse, 
the head of the Public Health Statistics Division of the 
Ministry of Welfare's Health Department, told DIYENA today that 
the total number of murder victims last year was 639, which was 
215 more than in the previous year. The number of suicides rose 
by 171 (a total of 1,090 suicides). 
  The number of accidental deaths, including homicides and 
suicides, increased by exactly 1,000. Last year there were 5,485 
accidental deaths. 
  Meanwhile, the birth rate is declining. The number of 
children born in 1993 was 4,246 less than in 1992. In all, 
27,323 children were born last year (not counting stillbirths). 
  Psychologist Janis Gulbis says this is a result of the 
dramatically lower standard of living. In his opinion, 85 
percent of the Latvian population is living on less than the 
minimum subsistence budget. There are many cases in which people 
have nothing to eat for a long time, and this is driving them to 
suicide and crime. 
  People are much less likely to seek medical treatment than 
before. Because of this, their illnesses are often neglected 
until they are severe enough to be fatal. Besides this, medicine 
and medical treatment are too expensive now.

<F P=106> [Article by Viesturs Rencis: "Still Drug Addicts"] </F>
  [Text] According to the State Drug Treatment and Health 
Center medical institutions have registered 794 drug addicts and 
358 drug users. In 1993 125 drug addicts were registered and 50 
drug users. Last year 383 drug addicts were treated in various 
medical institutions. 
  For its part in Riga alone there were 2,536 drug addicts, 
people arrested in drug dens and drug dealers, according to the 
information bureau of the National Battle Against Drug Addiction. 
  Unfortunately this is only the visible part of the iceberg. 
Specialists believe that there are six to ten thousand drug 
addicts in Latvia, 80 percent of them under 30 years of age. 
  On 27 February, at 1b Strelnieku Street, in the 
Ziemelblazmas club, at 2:00 pm, people will gather to 
continue working at establishing the movement Parents 
Against Drug Addiction. As NEATKARIGA CINA has already 
written, this movement unites parents in the battle against drug 
addiction in Scandanavia. 
  We remind you of the confidential number for drug addicts: 
391 307.

<F P=106> [Statement by Jan Minciewicz, chairman of the main governing </F>
board of the Union of Poles of Lithuania, taken from interview 
conducted by V. Kuznetsov, under the rubric "In Political 
Parties and Social Movements": "We Must Look to the Future"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the Fourth Congress of the Union of 
Poles of Lithuania, created in 1988, opened. In this period of 
time, it has followed a path from social to sociopolitical 
organization with a faction in the Seimas of the Republic of 
Lithuania which won in the elections to the Vilnius and 
Salcininkai rayon soviets. Our correspondent, V. Kuznetsov, 
asked the chairman of the main governing board of the Union of 
Poles of Lithuania, Jan Minciewicz, to tell about the Union's 
tasks and problems. 
  Five years have already passed since the day the Union of 
Poles was created, and in that time it has lived through various 
things. We lived through a kind of revolution too. While in 1988 
we were registered as a social organization, in 1992, on the eve 
of elections to the Seimas, we acquired the status of a 
sociopolitical organization which along with political parties 
received the right to participate in elections on a multiparty 
basis. And now we have a faction consisting of four people in 
the Seimas. Undoubtedly, this suggests the support of voters, 
especially voters of the Vilnius District. The recent elections 
to the Vilnius and Salcininkai rayon soviets, which as you know 
were very difficult, ended in victory for our organization. In 
these soviets our representatives constituted about 80 percent 
of the membership. All these things are, as they say, our 
political achievements. 
  As for our organization itself, we are preparing for the 
congress. Conferences of our branches in Vilnius and Vilnius, 
Salcininkai, Svencionys, and Trakai rayons as well as those of 
the primary organizations in Kaunas, Druskininkai, and Zarasai 
have been held. What is significant is that they came out in 
favor of preserving our organization's present status as a 
sociopolitical organization. That is to say, there are no 
prerequisites either for depoliticization (becoming a social 
organization again) or for transformation into a political 
party. I think that the congress will support this opinion of 
our rayon branches too. But the status of sociopolitical 
organization has its minuses too. First of all it restricts 
potential for drawing youth and high school students into our 
ranks, that is to say, it deprives us of a future. For according 
to existing legislation, we cannot create our organizations in 
schools and other educational establishments. This also applies 
to interdictions on creating them in labor collectives. 
  But persecution of activists of the Union of Poles of 
Lithuania after the disbanding of the Vilnius and Salcininkai 
rayon soviets and the administration of these territories 
through "governors" had a special effect on our organization's 
numbers. And these 2 years left their deep marks. We believe 
that the disbanding of these soviets was not justified and had 
serious consequences. Look at what is happening today with the 
allocation of land in Vilnius Rayon. Recently this issue was 
reviewed by state control, which drew the conclusion that the 
allocation of land by the "former governor" was illegal. But it 
is "spinning its wheels," although in our opinion there is every 
reason to rectify this situation--construction has begun in only 
a handful of cases. And the authority of the rayon soviet is not 
sufficient, there must be a decision of the government. But that 
is only part of the consequences of the disbanding of the 
soviets, which the Union of Poles of Lithuania has participated 
in cleaning up; with the help of jurists we provided various 
kinds of help to the people who were illegally harmed. Of course 
that is not our function; it should be done by the rayon soviet, 
which, as was already said, was unjustifiably disbanded. All 
this persecution brought down upon our activists--firings, 
summons to the procurator's office, discrediting in the 
press--played its role. The size of the Union of Poles of 
Lithuania fell by almost half, from 15,000 to 8,000 people, 
although the situation in various rayon organizations changed in 
different ways. Thus, while in Vilnius Rayon membership declined 
by half, in Trakai, in contrast, it rose, and in others it did 
not change at all. Here I must also talk about one other problem 
which disturbs us a great deal--the planned reform of the 
administrative-territorial division. At one time, to be more 
precise on 29 January 1991, the Supreme Soviet of the Republic 
of Lithuania adopted a decree which said that rayons of the 
Vilnius District must constitute one territorial unit with its 
own status. No one rescinded this decree, so it has legal force. 
But now new plans for the administrative-territorial division 
have appeared, and not one of them takes this decree into 
consideration. I think the congress will express an opinion on 
this issue, especially since our faction in the Seimas has 
prepared its own plan for a solution to the 
administrative-territorial division of the republic. What is our 
position? We believe it is unacceptable to unite the city of 
Vilnius with Vilnius Rayon, since neither the city nor the rayon 
wants this. But to call things by their real names, this is 
necessary for the Polish population which constitutes a majority 
in Vilnius Rayon to "dissolve" into this megapolis. Another goal 
is to divide the land of peasants living there and transfer it 
to the city. But the main goal is of course political--to ensure 
that the Polish population does not constitute a majority. That 
same goal is pursued by the resettlement of Vilnius Rayon with 
residents of the city by allocating lots for construction to 
them (as was already said, frequently illegally). But our plan 
is based on the Supreme Soviet decree which I already mentioned 
and, incidentally, international requirements which do not allow 
the dissolution of national minorities who live in close 
quarters. This, in our opinion, should mean the unification in 
Vilnius District of the Vilnius, Salcininkai, and Trakai (with 
the exception of Elektrenai) parts of Svencionys and Sirvintos 
rayons. However, there are many opponents of this plan. But the 
discussion of this issue will take place in the very near future. 
  What other problems of internal political life today disturb 
the Union of Poles, and in fact everyone who supports us? The 
Democratic Party of Labor of Lithuania [DPLL] has already been 
in power a year and a half. I must note that many of those who 
support us voted for it. They rendered their support in the 
presidential elections to A. Brazauskas too. Why? During that 
time it was obvious that a change of power was needed and a 
political force able to change the situation fundamentally 
should come to power. 
  Whether four or eight deputies were elected from the Union 
of 
Poles, nothing could fundamentally change. And many people voted 
for the DPLL and A. Brazauskas in the hope of getting rid of all 
the troubles. Unfortunately, that did not happen, and one can 
verify only deterioration in all areas. And while the 
socioeconomic situation, or rather its deterioration, affected 
everyone, issues of Polish culture, language, and national 
self-consciousness as a whole were more acute to those who 
elected and support us. Let us take our Polish university whose 
creation V. Landsbergis "blessed." However, about 100 students 
are in their third year of study there, but the school still has 
no formal status and no premises. On the contrary: a week ago a 
directive was received from the administration of the city 
soviet that the Polish university was to vacate the premises it 
occupies at 5 Sibaciaus Street and no other premises were 
offered. And what is being done with Polish television? Some 
authorities have begun to broadcast it, but others are shutting 
it down, arbitrarily superimpose other programs on its programs, 
and so on. The publication of textbooks in the Polish language 
is also declining. And this is already state policy--the 
decision was made by the Ministry of Culture and Education. And 
who is training cadres for Polish schools? The pedagogical 
university trains only specialists in Polish studies, but what 
about biology, chemistry, and geography? Not to mention the 
teaching of foreign languages or even the Lithuanian language in 
Polish schools. For example, there are 74 teachers of the 
Lithuanian language working in the schools of Salcininkai Rayon. 
But only 17 of them are Lithuanian specialists. The rest are 
chance people, teachers of other subjects. Given this situation 
can we really expect the teaching of the state language to 
improve? For if we are speaking of the state language, the 
question must be fundamentally resolved. Incidentally, the draft 
law on the state language which is already being reviewed in 
Seimas committees also has a number of provisions with which we 
find it difficult to agree. Thus, according to Article 5 on 
areas where national minorities live in close quarters, 
residents may be served in the language of this minority along 
with the state language in communications and health care 
institutions and on transport. That is to say, they may be 
served, and so they may not be! But this is a step backward as 
compared with the Law on National Minorities which says that the 
language of the minorities must be used in institutions of power 
with which people deal. Unfortunately, this is not the only 
defect of this draft. The draft does not guarantee that 
representatives of national minorities will receive higher 
education either. Of course we will express our opinion in the 
committee and in the Seimas, but I am not certain that the vote 
will be in our favor. 
  Yes, there are many problems, but we do not believe, unlike 
other political forces, that a permanent change in government or 
early elections will help us resolve them quickly. Our opinion 
is that first we must respect both our own laws which have 
already been adopted and international norms. For when Lithuania 
was accepted into the Council of Europe, it set the condition 
that we sign "Charters on Local Autonomy," where the rights of 
national minorities are defined. But up to this point this 
document has not been reviewed in the Seimas and, accordingly, 
has not been signed. To touch upon international problems, I 
would like to say a few words on the Lithuanian-Polish treaty 
which the signatories have been preparing to sign for a fairly 
long time. I believe that many of the things which I already 
spoke of and which are not being resolved at this time in our 
republic could have been envisioned in that treaty. They above 
all include exercise of the rights of the Polish population 
living on Lithuania's territory, the problem of the Polish 
university and Polish television, and so on. As for the preamble 
of this treaty and the historical evaluation of well-known 
events, I think that treaties are signed in the promise of 
future relations. The past is a matter for historians, but we 
must look to the future; otherwise we will never move forward. 
For those who were born here, in the Vilnius District, before 
the war are not to blame for being born on the territory of 
Poland. Therefore formulas which are acceptable not only to 
Lithuania and Poland but also to the Polish population of the 
Vilnius District must be found.

<F P=106> [Article by Arturas Racas: "The Parliament Finally </F>
Remembered the Press"] 
  [Text] The members of parliament yesterday granted 
themselves the right "to use not more frequently than once a 
month the state radio and television free of charge to air their 
issues." This principle was imposed almost unanimously during 
the debate on the final draft of the Parliament's statutes. 
  The opinions of the members of parliament differed somewhat 
when they tried to resolve the questions of remunerations. There 
was a lengthy debate on whether the members of parliament -- 
officials and ministers -- should get additional pay, but no 
decision was adopted. 
  The members of parliament also resolved that only the 
author's honorarium for works of art and their performance, also 
for publications and books will qualify for payment for creative 
activity (hourly remuneration for pedagogical, 
scholarly-scientific work or consultation having been crossed 
out from the list). Following the vote, deputy chairman of 
parliament J. Bernatonis congratulated the members of parliament 
for "having supported the ideals of socialism." 
  In the opinion of many members of parliament, there will be 
one more vote concerning this article, because it does not 
satisfy those who teach or work in the universities or similar 
institutions. 
  Yesterday the parliament also took care of the publishing 
houses and their editorial personnel that specialize in 
periodicals. The parliament decided to allow them to privatize 
the premises they are renting that belong to the sphere of state 
regulation. When such premises are not being privatized, 
municipal or district boards are obligated to provide them with 
space of equal value. 
  Just before the adoption of this decision, the members of 
parliament decided not to permit the privatization of the 
premises that are rented by the state information agency. The 
most vocal opposition to this was voiced by K. Snezko, a 
representative of the LDDP (Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party) 
faction, who had missed 78 meetings during two sessions and had 
never participated in the discussions. 
  Most of the representatives of the parliamentary factions of 
the Right also voted against the decision or abstained 
themselves, because in their opinion it would help the LDDP to 
strength its influence in the newspapers. 
  V. Zimnickas, who presented the report, was of a different 
opinion. He asserted that "if we want to preserve an independent 
press, we must help it." 
  In the afternoon meeting, the President's adviser on state 
and legal questions R. Andrikis submitted to the members of 
parliament a "Law on Declaring Property and Income of the 
Inhabitants of the Republic of Lithuania," which is presented by 
the President. According to Mr. Andrikis, the main principles of 
this law are the linking of the declaration with taxes, the 
universal character of declaration, and the secrecy of the 
information on the declaration. 
  Answering R. Ozolas, who asked how the new law essentially 
differed from the one that was earlier rejected by the 
president, R. Andrikis asserted that there was one difference: 
"the earlier law was a law on the listing of property." 
  After the members of parliament had approved the submission 
of the new law on the declaration of property and taxes, the 
head of the Conservative faction A. Kubilius congratulated J. 
Bernatonis on his victory and publicly suggested that both of 
them declare their own and their family members' property and 
income. J. Bernatonis did not respond to this offer; when asked 
by LIETUVOS RYTAS, why he did not answer the question, he 
replied: "Because the members of the parliament did not have 
their health checked before the elections." 
  Following the vote, social democrat N. Medvedevas said that 
he was going to lie down in front of the rostrum and block the 
new law until the experts have presented their conclusions on 
this law's potential consequences for Lithuania.

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Bolmatova: "The Authorities Are </F>
Facilitating the Inflow of Capital. Olga Bolmatova, FINANSOVYYE 
IZVESTIYA, Analyzes New Draft Laws on Foreign Investment"] 
  [Text] Specialists from the RAMSIR [Russian Agency for 
International Cooperation and Development], the Ministry of the 
Economy, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations have developed a draft of the Law "On Amendments and 
Additions to the Law of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist 
Republic 'On Concession Contracts and Production-Sharing 
Agreements Signed With Foreign Investors.'" 
  The Law "On Foreign Investment," which was passed on 4 July 
1991 and reflected the view of the world as of late 1990, has 
become hopelessly obsolete. Much debate has developed concerning 
the draft of a new redaction: Should national or special 
treatment be granted to foreign investors? Should a "grandfather 
clause" be introduced, and for whom? Who should be considered a 
foreign investor? As a result, the old wording of the legal 
treatment has been kept in the redaction which is now being 
considered by the government: no less favorable than national 
treatment. 
  The definition of a foreign investor has been broadened in 
amendments and additions to the law: Now not only foreign 
individuals and legal entities, states, and international 
organizations may be granted this status, but also "foreign 
economic units without the status of legal entities" (that is, a 
group of companies or persons) and citizens of Russia 
permanently residing abroad in the event they import to the 
country monetary funds, property, and property rights. 
  In keeping with the draft of the law, now not only "all 
types 
of property assets" will be considered foreign investment but 
also the rights to them and intellectual property rights. The 
law specifies that foreign exchange and the currency of the 
Russian Federation, which according to the Instruction of the 
Central Bank "Opening of Ruble-Denominated Accounts by 
Nonresidents," is credited to type I (investment) 
ruble-denominated accounts, can be used for investment purposes. 
  The inclusion in the law of a "grandfather clause" has 
become 
a more serious step to accommodate foreign capital; the clause 
guarantees enterprises in which the proportion of foreign 
investment comes to no less than 30 percent of authorized 
capital that for three years from the moment of registration of 
the enterprise, legislation will apply to it that was in effect 
at the moment of registration in the event that "conditions for 
investment activities deteriorate." If the contribution of a 
foreign investor amounts to at least $100,000, the clause will 
apply for 10 years. Interestingly, the law thus gives foreign 
investors a guarantee against changes in tax treatment, which is 
not common in world practice. To be sure, the procedure for 
implementing this clause is not spelled out in the draft law. 
  It is interesting to note that the "grandfather clause" in 
investment legislation is an absolute muddle: We read in the 
Edict "On Perfecting Work With Foreign Investment" of 27 
September 1993, which apparently performed the function of 
reassurance following Edict No. 1400: "Newly issued regulatory 
acts (?) which govern the conditions for the operation of 
foreign enterprises and joint ventures (?) on the territory of 
the Russian Federation shall not apply for three years to 
enterprises that exist as of the moment said acts take effect." 
Further on it is explained that the provision in question does 
not cover the introduction of more preferential conditions. At 
the RAMSIR, where they called this edict harmful and inexpert, 
they are apprehensive about thousands of enterprises proclaiming 
themselves "joint ventures," having found any, even 
questionable, investors who would agree to invest at least one 
dollar in their authorized capital. 
  Another document which likewise appeared during the period 
of 
the legislative change of seasons, the Edict "Issues in 
Production-Sharing Agreements in the Utilization of Minerals," 
says that if norms are established in Russia "that worsen the 
commercial results of the activities of an investor," amendments 
shall be made to the agreement which ensure the old level of 
profitability for the investor. However, this edict will remain 
in effect only until the relevant law comes out, but according 
to the latest redaction of the of the draft Law "On Concession 
Contracts and Production-Sharing Agreements Signed With Foreign 
Investors," amendments shall be made to the agreement only in 
the event of a change in legislation which "substantially 
worsens" the position of the investor. 
  New rules for registration of enterprises with foreign 
investment are yet another change which is planned to be 
included in the law on foreign investment. A limit will be 
established: Enterprises in which the volume of investment does 
not exceed $100,000 will be registered at the level of 
republics, krays, and oblasts. Larger enterprises, as well as 
those engaging in the extraction and processing of coal, oil, 
and gas, will be registered at the RAMSIR. According to the 
draft, foreign companies will no longer have the right to create 
branches in Russia; branches already in existence will undergo 
repeat registration. 
  A total of 40 amendments are being made to the law on 
foreign 
investment, which consists of 42 articles. Obviously, under the 
circumstances a new redaction of the law rather than amendments 
and additions should be at issue. 
  The law on concessions has been in preparation for a year 
now. As early as 21 July of last year the Supreme Soviet passed 
the Law "On Concessions and Other Contracts Signed With Foreign 
Investors," which described concession contracts, 
production-sharing agreements, contracts for the provision of 
services, contracts for long-term leases for state-owned 
facilities, "and other contracts." At the time the president did 
not confirm it. Apparently this was the reason why the 
aforementioned edict on production-sharing agreements appeared 
during the period of phased constitutional reform (it is not 
ruled out that it was due to the need to move along the 
"up-in-the-air" Elf Aquitaine project). 
  In its last redaction the law is entitled "On Concession 
Contracts and Production-Sharing Agreements Signed With Foreign 
Investors." The RAMSIR said that the law will be of "cognitive 
significance" to the regions and of practical significance to 
foreign investors, who will understand that "we are drawing 
close to worldwide norms." 
  The law specifies the jurisdiction of the center and the 
regions in drawing up lists of facilities offered for the 
signing of contracts with foreign investors and outlines the 
content of such contracts. 
  The draft laws on concessions and on foreign investment will 
be among the first submitted to the Duma. For now, the 
government is discussing the draft Edict "On Incentives for the 
Attraction of Foreign Investment to Priority Sectors of the 
National Economy."

<F P=106> [Treaty on Accord and Cooperation Between the Russian </F>
Federation and the Kingdom of Belgium, signed in Brussels on 8 
December 1993 by B. Yeltsin for the Russian Federation and by 
J.-L. Dehaene for the Kingdom of Belgium] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation and the Kingdom of Belgium 
henceforth referred to as the contracting parties, 
  relying on the bond of friendship and cooperation between 
their peoples, the mutual trust and adherence to the common 
values of freedom, democracy, justice and solidarity, 
  assuming that the Russian Federation is the successor state 
of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 
  believing that the historical changes taking place in Europe 
have opened prospects for creation of a fair and strong order on 
the European continent, based on a respect for international 
law, the United Nations Organization Charter, human rights and 
basic freedoms in accordance with the Helsinki Concluding Act, 
the Paris Charter for a New Europe, the Helsinki document of 
1992, "Challenge of the Time of Change," and other documents of 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), 
  emphasizing the need for ensuring security and stability in 
building a new Europe and striving to aid in this effort, 
  have come to agreement on the following: 
<H6>  Article 1 </H6>
  The contracting parties have decided to give their bilateral 
relations a new quality of accord and partnership. 
  The contracting parties shall develop their relations as 
friendly states on the basis of equal rights, respect for 
sovereignty and political independence of both states, mutual 
adherence to the principles of freedom, democracy, supremacy of 
law and human rights, as well as the adherence to the letter and 
the spirit of the Paris Charter for a New Europe, the Helsinki 
document of 1992, "Challenge of the Time of Change," and other 
CSCE documents. 
  This new quality of accord and partnership, based on the 
decisiveness of the contracting parties to overcome the 
consequences of the division of Europe into opposing blocks, 
will find its expression in all spheres of bilateral relations. 
<H6>  Article 2 </H6>
  The contracting parties shall use all the means at their 
disposal to promote a strengthening of the authority, role and 
effectiveness of the United Nations organization, as well as the 
full respect of the UN Charter by all member states. 
  The contracting parties affirm their unconditional adherence 
to the principles of peaceful regulation of disputes contained 
in the UN Charter. 
  The contracting parties shall actively aid in the 
realization 
of effective actions in the sphere of preventive diplomacy. 
<H6>  Article 3 </H6>
  The contracting parties affirm the decisive role which the 
CSCE may play in the cause of strengthening stability and 
security in Europe, and emphasize the principle importance of 
the statutes of the Helsinki Concluding Act, the Paris Charter 
for a New Europe, the Helsinki document of 1992, "Challenge of 
the Time of Change," as well as other CSCE documents. 
  The contracting parties shall facilitate the strengthening 
of 
the CSCE for purposes of ensuring the guarantees of human 
rights, democracy and the legal state, and preventing and 
regulating disputes by peaceful means. 
  The contracting parties ascribe particular importance to 
strengthening the capacity of the CSCE for actions in the 
spheres of preventive diplomacy and regulation of conflicts. 
<H6>  Article 4 </H6>
  The contracting parties concur in the fact that security and 
stability must be based on dialogue, partnership and 
cooperation, as well as on the practical realization of the 
principle of defense adequacy. They believe that a peaceful 
order in Europe presupposes, on the basis of adherence to the 
concluded treaties, a full implementation of the Treaty on OVSE 
[Conventional Armed Forces in Europe], a continuation of efforts 
toward reduction and control of arms and armed forces, a 
development of measures of trust aimed at guaranteeing security 
and stability on the continent, as well as the nonproliferation 
of mass destruction weapons. 
  The contracting parties affirm their adherence to the 1968 
Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the directives 
coordinated by the group of countries who are suppliers of 
nuclear materials, and the 1993 Convention on Banning the 
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Application of Chemical 
Weapons and Their Destruction, and will take necessary measures 
toward excluding the transfer of materials, technologies or 
equipment of nuclear weapons or other types of mass destruction 
weapons in these countries to other countries. 
<H6>  Article 5 </H6>
  The contracting parties acknowledge the important role of 
the 
European Union, as well as the significant contribution of 
international economic and financial organizations in the 
balanced development of the world economy and in the political 
and economic development of Europe. 
  The contracting parties believe that the success of reforms, 
the transition to a market economy and the integration of Russia 
into the world economy are facilitated by its rapprochement with 
the European Union, specifically by means of conclusion of the 
appropriate treaties between them, such as the treaty on 
partnership and cooperation. 
  The contracting parties support efforts on cooperation 
within 
the framework of the Council of Europe. They acknowledge, in 
particular, the importance of programs aimed at the development 
of law and the strengthening of democratic institutions. 
<H6>  Article 6 </H6>
  The contracting parties are stepping up bilateral meetings 
at 
the appropriate level--political as well as 
expert-technical--along with regular contacts in the course of 
various meetings on a multilateral level and within the 
framework of the European Union. All the questions which are of 
mutual interest will be discussed at these meetings. 
  The contracting parties shall promote the implementation of 
regular consultations on current questions at the level of the 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs. 
<H6>  Article 7 </H6>
  The contracting parties believe it is important to develop 
contacts and exchanges of information in the military sphere. In 
this context, they provide for visits of military delegations at 
various levels and exchanges of opinions. 
  For this purpose, they are compiling bilateral programs of 
military contacts. 
<H6>  Article 8 </H6>
  The contracting parties shall cooperate in the humanitarian 
sphere, giving first priority importance to maintaining 
generally accepted standards of democracy and human rights, 
specifically for the purpose of promoting the activity of 
charitable organizations. If necessary, they will reach 
administrative agreements with local authorities in order to 
facilitate actions in extraordinary circumstances. 
  The contracting parties shall cooperate in clarifying the 
fates of their citizens who, in connection with various 
circumstances, find themselves on the territory of the other 
contracting party, or who are missing there. Within this 
framework, they conclude agreements for the purpose of allowing 
the investigators of the other party access to archives which 
might contain information on the above-mentioned citizens. 
  The contracting parties shall cooperate in the sphere of 
return of archives. 
<H6>  Article 9 </H6>
  The contracting parties believe that such fields as culture, 
education, professional training, public health and scientific 
research are one of the important spheres of their cooperation. 
  With these spheres, which are within the competency of the 
Communities and Regions of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Russian 
Federation is ready to conclude the appropriate treaties and 
agreements with the above-mentioned communities and regions, 
according to the constitutional and legislative directives which 
are in effect in both countries. 
<H6>  Article 10 </H6>
  The contracting parties stress the importance of better 
mutual familiarization with each other's legal systems. 
  The contracting parties shall promote cooperation between 
the 
institutions of justice and the law enforcement agencies of both 
states, including mutual legal assistance in civil and criminal 
cases and cooperation in the struggle against crime, unlawful 
circulation of narcotics and psychotropic substances, terrorist 
acts of an international character and contraband, including the 
unlawful transport of cultural valuables over the border. 
  The Belgian side will have a favorable attitude toward the 
Russian Federation and will render it assistance in joining in 
treaties on cooperation in the sphere of the struggle against 
crime concluded by the Council of Europe member states. 
<H6>  Article 11 </H6>
  Without infringing upon the competencies of the subjects of 
the Russian Federation and the Communities and Regions of the 
Kingdom of Belgium in the sphere of international cooperation, 
the contracting parties shall facilitate the enhancement of 
mutual cooperation in the sphere of economics, energetics, 
transport, communications, finance and agriculture, ascribing 
particular importance to development of programs for advanced 
training of workers at enterprises and financial organizations. 
  As necessary, the competent authorities of the contracting 
parties shall develop new programs of cooperation, primarily in 
such spheres as the agroindustrial complex, privatization, 
financial services and banking, the trade network, 
communications, informatics, transport, energetics, application 
of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, and specifically nuclear 
safety and the processing of military fissionable materials for 
their application for civilian purposes. 
  In this context, the contracting parties believe that the 
activity of the Mixed Commission on Economic Cooperation Between 
Russia and the Belgium-Luxemburg Economic Union (BLEU) must be 
adapted to the new situation which is being formed in connection 
with the transition of the Russian Federation to the market 
economy. 
  The contracting parties shall aid in the creation of 
favorable conditions for establishing direct relations and 
activity of enterprises and other legal persons, encouraging and 
protecting capital investments, and developing exchanges of 
economic information. 
  They shall renew the existing legal documents, increase 
their 
effectiveness and develop new ones which will be adapted to the 
new economic and juridical situation in the Russian Federation. 
<H6>  Article 12 </H6>
  The competent authorities of the contracting parties shall 
aid in expanding and enhancing cooperation in the spheres of 
science, technology, space research and environmental protection 
for the purposes of using the achievements of modern science and 
technologies for peaceful purposes. They encourage scientific 
exchanges and the implementation of joint projects. 
<H6>  Article 13 </H6>
  The contracting parties promise to hold consultations on 
disputed questions, which may be raised by each of the 
contracting parties in regard to the financial and material 
aspects of the property and interests of individuals and legal 
persons of both countries. 
<H6>  Article 14 </H6>
  The contracting parties shall ensure, on the basis of 
reciprocity, conditions for the normal activity of diplomatic 
and consular institutions, as well as other official 
representations of the other party. 
  For purposes of specifying responsibilities within the 
framework of the CSCE regarding the freedom of movement and 
transit for all citizens of the contracting parties on their 
territories, they will take into consideration these obligations 
for concluding the necessary bilateral agreements in accordance 
with international treaties already concluded by each of the 
parties in this sphere. 
<H6>  Article 15 </H6>
  The present treaty in no way alters the obligations which 
bind the contracting parties in accordance with other treaties 
in which they are participants. They in no way affect the 
obligations of the contracting parties in regard to third 
countries and are not directed against any of them. 
<H6>  Article 16 </H6>
  Each of the contracting parties shall notify the other party 
upon completion of procedures provided by its legislation for

minister of foreign affairs: "The Foreign Policy of a Russia in 
Transition" 
  [Text] October 1993 in Moscow graphically demonstrated to 
the world that peoples that reject totalitarianism must defend 
their choice in struggle against the political forces of the 
past, which will strive to revive the old order by violent 
means. The people of Russia, who in 1991 elected a president in 
a nationwide election and then reaffirmed their confidence in 
his course in the April referendum, in October 1993 once again 
rejected the reactionary alternative for our country's 
development. They expressed their support for Russia's 
transformation into a law-governed state and for making 
democracy and peaceful aspirations the basis for our country's 
domestic and foreign policy here on the eve of the 21st century. 
Only affirmation of a democratic state can provide a reliable 
guarantee for citizens' rights and the dynamic social and 
economic development of society. Only by this means is it 
possible to affirm that our country is a normal great power and 
to realize its interests not through confrontation but instead 
through cooperation in the West, East and South. 
  From the very start, the new Russia's diplomats have turned 
sharply away from service to the totalitarian system and 
attempts to restructure it, going instead in the direction of 
aiding the radical transformation of society and protection of 
our state's national interests and human rights and liberties, 
especially those of our countrymen. 
  This change has taken place under difficult circumstances. 
These included not only the understandable difficulties of 
carrying out economic and political reforms in a gigantic 
country with a multiethnic population and serious regional 
differences. We also faced the task of coping with major foreign 
policy tasks: to eliminate in actuality and not just in words 
the heavy burden of the Cold War, which divided humanity into 
opposing blocs; to ensure foreign political and economic support 
for Russian reforms; and to surround Russia with a zone of 
good-neighborliness and cooperation. And all this had to be done 
in extremely short order. This was dictated by the logic of 
struggle against the forces of the past. It was essential that 
reforms be quickly carried through to the point at which a 
return to the old system would become impossible. The dynamic 
nature of events and the element of spontaneity in their 
development necessitated a constant readiness to engage in 
tactical maneuvers which by their very nature assume not only 
gains, but also the possibility of losses, even including the 
loss of former allies in the struggle for reform. However, the 
most important things are confidence in the correctness of the 
chosen path and a strategic course toward consistent 
transformation of society and entry on that basis into the 
community of the most developed democratic states -- all that 
remains unchanged. 
  The first three years of the new Russia's foreign policy 
have 
been a major historical period that combines its stages with the 
specific objectives and tactics inherent in each of them. 
  The chronology begins with B. N. Yeltsin's election as RSFSR 
Supreme Soviet chairman on 28 May 1990. The main thrust of 
political and diplomatic activity by Russia's leaders at that 
stage was the struggle to achieve state sovereignty and 
independence for the Russian Federation. It was necessary to 
create a new state based not on the monopolistic dominance of 
any one ideology, but rather on the supremacy of the values of 
democracy and law. Russia's declaration of state sovereignty on 
12 June 1990 falls within this period. 
  I clearly recall numerous discussions at the time about a 
concept of Russia's national and state interests and about the 
orientation of its foreign policy. The discussion stage passed 
quickly. By approximately October 1990 Russia's leaders had set 
a course toward ensuring Russia's independent entry into the 
international arena, something that proclamation of our 
country's sovereignty was intended to reinforce. 
  The foundation chosen for the concept of Russia's security 
and foreign policy was the goal of reviving our country as a 
great power by overcoming the dominance of the 
imperial-totalitarian system and creating a law-governed, 
democratic and federative state. In the process we assumed that 
the vital interests of Russia's people include, firstly, 
development of friendly relations with the people of the other 
republics in the renewed Union and, secondly, accession to a 
proper place in the community of civilized peoples in Eurasia 
and America. 
  One distinctive feature of Russian foreign policy was to be 
a 
common sense-dictated renunciation of ideological schemes and 
messianic ambitions on a global scale in favor of realism in the 
assessment of Russia's needs and in favor of specific 
appropriate actions. The support for this would come not only 
from our country's own strength, but also from its commonality 
of interests with the interests of the other republics which at 
the time comprised the USSR. 
  It was precisely these objectives that determined the nature 
of the first foreign policy steps taken by Russia in 1990. On 19 
November the RSFSR signed a treaty with Ukraine, on 21 November 
with Kazakhstan, and on 18 December with Belarus. The 
signatories to those treaties recognized each other as sovereign 
states and stated their intention to develop their interstate 
relations based on the principles of equality, noninterference 
in each other's internal affairs, renunciation of the use of 
force, and other commonly accepted standards of international 
law. The signatories also agreed to exchange diplomatic 
delegations. 
  Even at this stage in the emergence of relations with the 
future members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Russia 
strove to orient its treaty relations with them toward 
comprehensive development, not toward disintegration of ties 
within the boundaries of the then-existing USSR. This was 
expressed in treaty stipulations concerning the importance of a 
collective security system, interaction and coordination on 
foreign policy, creation of a common economic space, and close 
cooperation in the fields of transportation, communications, 
migration policy, the environment and anti-crime efforts. 
  At that time revival of the Russian State was envisioned 
within the framework of a renewed Union of Sovereign States. 
Therefore there is no way that it can be claimed that by Russia 
seeking its own voice in the area of foreign policy it radically 
departed from the international course of the then-existing 
USSR, with perhaps the exception of the area of human rights. On 
the contrary, that search was actually aimed at preserving unity 
of interests among the republics of the USSR. Renewal of the 
Union, we sincerely believed at the time, could be made to fit 
quite well within the framework of the Novoogarev process. 
Russian leaders' approach during that period was notable for its 
great flexibility and a willingness to tolerate even a lack of 
complete internal sovereignty for Russia, even though by that 
time its sovereignty in international affairs in no way differed 
from the sovereignty of the central USSR government. 
  Russia played a constructive role in maintaining common 
ground between the independent states that subsequently 
established the Commonwealth. This active binding role on the 
part of Russia during the emergence of the CIS appears even more 
obvious as that turbulent period in history recedes into the 
past. But even then the idea that Russia could and to all 
appearances would become the successor to the USSR gradually 
came to have practical meaning for our foreign partners. 
Meetings and talks with the heads of the world's leading 
countries at their initiative during visits to Moscow began to 
occupy a large part of B. N. Yeltsin's work schedule. 
  The theme of a majority of these talks was acknowledgement 
of 
the efforts made by Russia to achieve understanding of the 
realities of a nuclear world on the part of the union republics 
with weapons of mass destruction deployed in their territory. 
The importance of those efforts increased against the backdrop 
of the then-unclear effects of the Union's likely 
disintegration. The counterparts also approved of Russia's 
willingness to assume the role of the only state to have nuclear 
weapons deployed within its territory in the event that the USSR 
collapsed. 
  This upsurge in the Russian leadership's foreign policy 
activism helped improve its international standing. This 
prompted the increasing displeasure of and then resistance from 
the central USSR government. In addition, more and more open 
resistance began to be offered by reactionary forces in the 
state apparatus. Even at that stage the Russian leadership was 
very concerned over the emergence, with the active assistance of 
those forces, of conflict situations in various regions of the 
USSR, in particular in the Baltic region, South Ossetia, 
Azerbaijan and Armenia. Statements and decrees by the highest 
governmental bodies in the RSFSR concerning the situation in the 
Baltic region (12 January 1991), the situation in South Ossetia 
(31 March 1991) and the situation in Azerbaijan and Armenia are 
evidence of the Russian leadership's efforts to resolve those 
situations by legal, democratic means. 
  The conflict between the forces of democracy and 
totalitarianism increased sharply in the summer of 1991. B. N. 
Yeltsin's election by a nationwide vote on 12 June 1991 to serve 
as president of a sovereign and independent Russia was perceived 
by those supporting a return to the old order as an alarm signal. 
  At this stage the primary orientation of the Russian 
leadership's foreign policy course was protection of Russia's 
international standing and its ties with foreign states against 
attacks on them by domestic political opponents. It was 
important to neutralize the threat of Russia's isolation in the 
event of an attempt to set up a dictatorship and to prevent an 
eruption of international confrontation, which could well have 
happened as a result of the bitter clashes between the forces of 
democracy and totalitarianism in the USSR. These objectives also 
determined the orientation of the tactical course in Russia's 
foreign policy up to the time of the coup. 
  Critics then and now of the new Russia's foreign policy 
course have accused the RSFSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
seeking to "break up the Union." Such claims could not be any 
farther from the truth. Russia's leaders were actively involved 
in the drafting of the "Treaty on a Union of Sovereign 
Republics." However, the negotiation process leading to 
establishment of a union of independent, democratic states was 
interrupted by the coup of August 1991. The forces of the past 
sought to halt democratic reforms, take the country back to Cold 
War-era confrontation and essentially place it in a position of 
international isolation. 
  Those alarming days in August clearly demonstrated the 
resolve and energy of Russia's first president, who organized 
and headed democratic forces' repulse of the coup plotters' 
actions. Around the world the symbols of those events were B. N. 
Yeltsin's appeal to the people of Moscow from atop a tank in 
front of the White House and the president's meetings with 
foreign politicians and diplomats seeking to demonstrate the 
democratic world's solidarity with the people of Russia. 
  The situation became so difficult that by the end of the day 
on 19 August the decision had been made to dispatch the RSFSR 
minister of foreign affairs to France with instructions to form 
a "government in exile" if necessary. Fortunately the crisis 
ended in the complete defeat of the coup plotters and 
reinforcement of the democratic trend in our country's political 
life. In international terms the most notable fact was that 
during the coup virtually all the developed countries supported 
Russia. 
  In the period immediately following the coup the primary 
objective of Russian diplomacy was to win broad international 
support for the actions of the Russian Federation's leaders, who 
found themselves virtually the only real power in the country. A 
clear trend toward disintegration of the Union appeared. The 
reason for this was the collapse of its old structure and the 
weakness of the new, democratic institutions that were still 
just emerging. Under these conditions only Russia could prevent 
the uncontrolled collapse of ties between the republics that 
comprised the USSR. 
  Until the last possible moment Russia's leaders fought for a 
union treaty and attempted to keep the Novoogarev process going. 
Those who blame Russia for the "collapse" of the USSR are 
blaming the wrong people. The end of the old Union was brought 
about solely by those who organized a coup to "protect" it: the 
party nomenklatura, which rallied around the State Committee for 
the State of Emergency. 
  With the end of the USSR's existence began a new stage of 
affirmation of Russian foreign policy as the policy of a 
sovereign great power, the legal successor to the USSR. As of 
January 1992 Russia had been recognized by 131 states. The 
country's leaders assigned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the 
task of drafting and implementing a new course in the 
international arena. In a speech to a session of the MFA Board 
on 27 October 1992 B. N. Yeltsin defined the principal 
objectives of Russian diplomacy thus: to ensure favorable 
external conditions for the political and economic reforms that 
had been begun, elimination of the legacy of the Cold War, and 
complete dismantling of confrontational structures left over 
from the past. 
  The top priority in Russia's foreign policy was the creation 
of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a new form of 
voluntary and equal cooperation between the republics of the 
former USSR. On 8 December 1991 an agreement establishing the 
CIS was signed in Minsk. The original members were the RSFSR, 
Ukraine and Belarus, which were later joined by Kazakhstan and a 
number of other republics. Russia's position of active support 
for the Commonwealth immediately gave the CIS a firm foundation. 
  Of fundamental importance was the signing on 21 December 
1991 
of an agreement between the RSFSR, Ukraine, Belarus and 
Kazakhstan concerning measures to deal with the nuclear weapons 
deployed in their territory. In accordance with that document 
the right to use nuclear weapons was turned over to the 
president of Russia. That step helped maintain strategic 
stability in the world and strengthened the confidence of the 
international partners of Russia and the other CIS states in the 
course set by Commonwealth members in international affairs. 
  Despite the difficult and contradictory nature of its 
origin, 
the CIS has become a political and economic reality of the 
modern world. A solid foundation of treaty law has been created 
for the CIS. At a meeting of heads of CIS states in Minsk in 
January 1993 the Commonwealth Charter was approved. The 
significance of that document lies primarily in the fact that it 
opens up the possibility of deeper cooperation for those CIS 
countries that genuinely strive for that. But neither does it 
exclude from the Commonwealth those who are still wavering, 
permitting them to participate in cooperation in forms and 
degrees which they find acceptable. Thus the idea of a 
"variable-speed," multi-option Commonwealth put forward by B. N. 
Yeltsin found not only support but also legal expression in 
Minsk. 
  The standing executive body of the CIS -- the Coordinating 
and Consultative Committee -- began functioning. More than 30 
interstate, intergovernmental and interagency bodies were 
established to coordinate the activities of Commonwealth members 
in a broad range of fields ranging from foreign policy to 
environmental protection. Meetings between CIS heads of state 
and heads of government are becoming increasingly businesslike. 
Russia's partners are ridding themselves, though not without 
difficulty, of the euphoria that accompanied their first months 
of independence and are demonstrating a growing understanding of 
the importance of maintaining and developing integrating ties 
within the CIS. Stronger reintegration trends allowed a number 
of Commonwealth members to establish the Economic Union in 1993 
and begin creating a new type of ruble zone. Of course, these 
processes are not without difficulty. However, Russia's leaders 
are working patiently to coordinate economic and financial 
interests within the framework of the CIS. Adherence to the 
principles of equal rights and mutual benefit will allow members 
of the Commonwealth to create a solid foundation for integration. 
  The emergence of independent states in place of the former 
USSR has raised the issue of their admission to the Council on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Russian diplomats 
have actively supported that option. There have also been some 
skeptics among the participants in the European process, and we 
have had to change the minds of these. Admission of the Central 
Asian and Transcaucasus republics to the CSCE was a step of 
strategic significance both to those countries and in terms of 
the development of the European process. The new CSCE members 
have accepted moral and political obligations to pursue a policy 
in keeping with high international standards in the area of 
protection for human rights. This is a powerful additional 
incentive that will help the values of democracy take root in 
the post-Soviet space. 
  One important aspect of Russia's policy in the "near abroad" 
is protection for the rights of the Russian-speaking population 
living there. Our long-term goal is creation within the CIS of a 
unified legal space that will encourage compliance with 
internationally recognized rights and liberties for individuals 
and ethnic, religious and other minorities. At the initiative of 
Russian diplomats the decision was made to establish a Human 
Rights Commission within the Commonwealth. Russia favors 
adoption of a "Declaration of Human Rights in the CIS States." 
  In bilateral relations with its CIS partners the primary 
goal 
of Russian diplomacy has been to conclude treaties regarding 
mutual protection for the interests of citizens in the 
signatories' territory, the right to freely choose citizenship, 
the rights of ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious 
minorities, and the terms of citizens' emigration to other 
states. 
  One focus of particular alarm and concern among the leaders 
of Russia and the Russian Federation MFA has been the status of 
our fellow citizens and countrymen in the Baltic countries, 
particularly Estonia and Latvia. Russia's democrats, who during 
the period of CPSU rule staunchly defended the right of the 
Baltic peoples to reestablish historical justice, now on the 
very same grounds favor a civilized, just approach to the rights 
of those countries' Russian-speaking population. The issue of 
protection for human rights is on the agenda of our talks with 
representatives of the Baltic countries at all levels, including 
the highest level. Russian diplomacy is also mobilizing 
international organizations and institutions -- the U.N., the 
CSCE and the Council of Europe -- in support of human rights in 
the Baltic countries. A certain positive effect on the 
situation, particularly in Estonia, has resulted from the 
efforts of the CSCE Supreme Commissar for Ethnic Minority 
Affairs. 
  Liberating the peoples of the former USSR from the 
totalitarian past has been a difficult and at times painful 
process, one accompanied in many regions by outbreaks of 
aggressive nationalism. The result has been the emergence of a 
number of conflict situations which directly threaten Russia's 
national security interests. As of the end of 1993 approximately 
two million refugees had entered our country, in particular from 
regions where interethnic clashes are occurring. Aiding these 
people would be a difficult economic burden for any state and in 
particular for Russia, which is currently going through a 
transition period. It is not only those directly involved that 
are the victims of ethnic conflicts, but also ethnic minorities, 
including the Russian-speaking minority, which has become an 
object of persecution and sometimes of outright ethnic purges. 
Local conflicts have become the suppliers of organized crime in 
Russia. No civilized state can tolerate an increase in such 
threats literally on its own doorstep. 
  The nationalist patriots, particularly those among the 
members of the Supreme Soviet, have persistently demanded that 
Russia's leaders solve the problem of conflicts along Russia's 
perimeter using old imperial methods, i.e. military force and 
dictates to sovereign states. That course, which threatens to 
bring on the collapse of the Commonwealth and the emergence of a 
ring of hostile states around Russia, has been firmly rejected 
by our country's leaders. Instead, emphasis has been placed on a 
policy of active peacemaking that includes preventive diplomacy 
to avoid conflicts, arbitration and the conducting of 
peacekeeping operations. 
  Our country's president has been an active participant in 
the 
pursuit of Russia's peacekeeping course in the post-Soviet 
space. In particular, widespread acclaim and approval by the 
international community greeted B. N. Yeltsin's initiatives to 
settle the Karabakh conflict. The Russian leadership is urging 
the parties to the conflict to cease military clashes 
immediately, withdraw all military units to the positions held 
by them prior to violation of the ceasefire, and come to Moscow 
to sign an agreement on complete and comprehensive cessation of 
military operations. 
  Russian diplomats are actively involved in peacekeeping 
efforts. The minister of foreign affairs has already made 
several trips to "hot spots" from Abkhazia to Tajikistan. 
Special Russian presidential representatives are working to 
bring about a solution to conflicts in the Transcaucasus region. 
It was mainly at our initiative that the CIS began to reorient 
itself toward more active peacekeeping efforts. Specifically, 
the decision was made to create collective CIS peacekeeping 
forces in Tajikistan. However, thus far the main burden of 
peacekeeping efforts in the former USSR has been borne by 
Russia. There are 20,000 Russian military personnel taking part 
in peacekeeping operations in three republics: Moldova, Georgia 
and Tajikistan. Not everything has gone smoothly by any means, 
but the only alternative to Russian peacekeeping would be the 
loss of Russian ties and influence in the "near abroad" that 
have come into being over centuries. That means there is only 
one solution: qualitative improvement of our forces protecting 
the peace in "hot spots." 
  The peacekeeping operations currently being conducted by 
Russia are in keeping with the objectives and principles of 
peacekeeping as set forth in the U.N. Charter. Russian 
peacekeeping forces are present in all areas at the request of 
legitimate governments and with the consent of all parties to 
the conflict. Yes, we do have to resort to peacekeeping methods 
that are not traditional for the U.N. That includes 
participation in peacekeeping operations by forces from 
neighboring states (mainly Russia itself) and even by the 
parties to the conflict. But this practice has proven its 
effectiveness in the Dniester region and in South Ossetia, where 
no blood has been shed in over a year. It would be simply 
unreasonable to reject this as "incorrect." Therefore at the 
48th session of the U.N. General Assembly Russian diplomats 
urged the international community to provide active support for 
our peacekeeping efforts. Specifically, we expressed support for 
the creation of a voluntary fund to aid peacekeeping efforts in 
the former USSR. 
  The Russian leadership has subordinated its approach to 
democratic states in West and East to the goal of establishing 
partnership relations with them, and over the long term alliance 
relationships. That guideline has from the very first days after 
the USSR ceased to exist helped prompt the democratic world to 
undertake active efforts in support of the reform process in 
Russia and the other CIS countries. In late January 1992 
Washington was the scene of a coordinating conference on 
assistance to the newly independent states that had emerged out 
of the former Soviet Union. There were 47 states and seven 
leading international economic organizations participating. In 
his message to those attending the conference, B. N. Yeltsin 
expressed Russia's desire to achieve genuine economic and social 
revitalization through stimulation of broad business cooperation 
with all interested partners. 
  The course toward the building of new relations with the 
outside world was also reflected in Russian diplomats' first 
steps at the highest level. In this context the most major 
events were participation by Russia's president in a U.N. 
Security Council session in January 1992 and his visits to 
England, the United States and Canada. 
  From the U.N. podium Russia's leader declared that Russia 
was 
joining the world community as a firm and consistent supporter 
of freedom, democracy and humanism. B. N. Yeltsin expressed 
support for a decisive reduction in strategic offensive weapons 
and tactical nuclear weapons, a complete ban on nuclear testing, 
substantial reductions in conventional weapons, a ban on 
chemical and bacteriological weapons and creations of a 
Europe-wide collective security system. In London, at Camp David 
and in Ottawa declarations were signed on the prospects for 
partnership between Russia and England, the United States and 
Canada. Those documents set forth for the first time the 
fundamentally new foundations, free of ideological 
confrontation, of our relations with states that were counted by 
the Soviet leadership among "potential opponents." 
  The key stages in the further complete dismantling of the 
Cold War legacy were the signing of the Russian-American Charter 
of Partnership and Friendship (June 1992), which stated that 
"increases in the wealth, prosperity and security of a 
democratic Russian Federation and the United States of America 
are vitally interconnected," and conclusion of the SALT II 
Treaty (December 1992). The Russian-American summit meeting in 
Vancouver (April 1993) focused, for the first time in the 
history of relations between Moscow and Washington, not on ways 
of overcoming confrontation, but instead on ways of laying the 
groundwork for economic interaction. 
  A similar breakthrough was also achieved in Russia's 
relations with the other leading developed states of the world 
-- France, England, Germany and Italy. Patient work began on 
genuine normalization of relations with Japan based on the 
principles of law and justice. 
  On the basis of political partnership it became possible to 
shift Russia's relations with those states to a frank and 
intensive dialogue on financial and economic issues. The 
previous topic of how to eliminate the threat of global war was 
replaced as central issue by problems pertaining to Russia's 
access to markets, including markets in high-tech products, 
nuclear materials and space services. 
  Russian diplomats were among the initiators of a decisive 
reinforcement of the CSCE, a unique tool for strengthening peace 
and preventing conflicts in the North Atlantic region. The 
foundations of this approach to the European process were laid 
out by B. N. Yeltsin during a meeting of heads of state and 
heads of government from the CSCE member countries in Helsinki 
on 9-10 July 1992. Concretizing that approach, Russian diplomats 
put forward at the Rome session of the CSCE Council of Ministers 
of Foreign Affairs (November 1993) extensive proposals aimed at 
increasing the effectiveness of CSCE organs, stepping up the 
Conference's peacekeeping functions and more closely 
coordinating efforts in the field of protection for human rights 
and the rights of ethnic minorities, with preventive CSCE 
diplomacy in Europe's conflicts zones. 
  One important aspect of Russia's European policy has been 
active participation in new regional associations such as the 
Council on Barents-Eurarctic Cooperation, the Council of Baltic 
Sea States and Black Sea Economic Cooperation. In this area as 
well our goal is to utilize the opportunities offered by those 
organizations to create a zone of good-neighborliness around 
Russia. 
  It has proven possible to achieve a genuine breakthrough in 
Russia's relations with the countries of Eastern Europe. Visits 
by Russia's president to Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and 
Slovakia have made it possible not only to clear away old -- 
sometimes prewar -- debris from our bilateral relations, but 
also, and most importantly, to lay down a fundamentally new 
foundation for our relations with the new democracies. Yet there 
also remains much to be done in that area, particularly in terms 
of developing trade and economic ties with the region. Generally 
speaking, in contrast to many other powers, particularly the 
West, in its present circumstances Russia does not rely so much 
on economic ties and leverage in its foreign policy as it uses 
policy to compensate for its foreign economic weakness. 
  Russian diplomacy, guided by the ideas of peacemaking, has 
been actively involved in international efforts to resolve the 
conflict in former Yugoslavia. Our actions, undertaken in close 
coordination with other parties to a resolution of the 
Yugoslavian situation, are aimed at establishing peace as 
quickly as possible in Bosnia-Herzegovina and normalizing 
relations between the republics of the former SFRY [Socialist 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. 
  The dynamic creation of new relations with the states of the 
West has by no means caused a "pro-Western slant" in Russian 
diplomacy, a charge often levelled by national-patriotic 
politicians. Entry into partnership relations with the United 
States and the countries of Western Europe is occurring in 
parallel with greater Russian attention to the East. 
  One landmark on that path was a visit by Russia's president 
to China. In a joint declaration adopted by the two countries, 
Russia and China recognized each other as friendly states. A 
mutual interest was expressed in the equal and ongoing nature of 
bilateral relations, without any geopolitical alliance but also 
without relapses into confrontation. The visit laid down a solid 
foundation for development of relations in trade, science, 
technology, personnel training and military affairs. Talks have 
been stepped up regarding reduction of armed forces along the 
border and clearer definition of the border's location. This has 
helped further strengthen the spirit of mutual trust and 
businesslike partnership in Russian-Chinese relations. 
  Russia's relations with another great Asian country, India, 
have gotten off to a new start. The treaty of friendship and 
cooperation signed during highest-level Russian-Indian talks in 
New Delhi in January 1993, while retaining all the positive 
things that existed in relations between the USSR and India, 
also puts those relations on a basis of mutual benefit and frees 
them of the logic of geopolitical alliances pitting some 
countries against others, as had previously been imposed by 
Moscow. 
  Russian diplomats have also succeeded in "opening up" the 
ASEAN countries, the Persian Gulf and the Republic of South 
Africa for business cooperation and new partnerships. 
  The emergence of the foreign policy of Russia as an 
independent state has required major organizational and 
personnel reinforcement of the Russian diplomatic service. An 
important step in this regard was the creation of an updated 
Russian diplomatic service in October 1990, as well as the 
introduction of the institution of Russian representation in the 
USSR's foreign institutions and delegations in the spring of 
1991. 
  The staff of the former USSR MFA, like all of Soviet 
society, 
was excessively ideologically oriented. For many decades Soviet 
diplomacy was in effect a part of the CPSU Central Committee's 
International Department. Consistent efforts to get rid of the 
burden of old stereotypes and stagnant mindsets began after the 
merger of the RSFSR MFA apparatus with the USSR MFA in late 
1991. That process was made easier by the fact that the Russian 
MFA had already removed all party structures in August 1991. 
Simultaneously with this reorganization of the diplomatic 
service a course was set toward increasing its professionalism. 
The ministry's apparatus was reoriented toward protecting 
Russia's national and state interests as Russia underwent a time 
of revolutionary changes. 
  An exceptionally important role was played by the fact that 
as of February 1992 the Russian Federation MFA and a number of 
other key ministries have been administered directly by our 
country's president in order to ensure more timely solutions to 
foreign policy issues. This practice has won Russia's foreign 
policy broad recognition and respect abroad. By the spring of 
1992 the reorganization of the diplomatic apparatus on the basis 
of the Russian MFA was complete. This made it possible to create 
an integrated foreign policy mechanism and bring new, democratic 
blood into the diplomatic service. 
  The Russian MFA has always striven for cooperation with the 
Supreme Soviet, providing it with all possible support in the 
development of interparliamentary relations. Within the 
ministry's structure a special administration has been 
established to handle relations with the Supreme Soviet and with 
political and public organizations. However, over time the 
Supreme Soviet came to be dominated by openly anti-reform 
forces. They focused their efforts on confrontation with the 
executive branch and resistance to the reform policy. The 
situation was further exacerbated by the efforts of certain 
individuals in the Supreme Soviet leadership to conduct 
"personal" foreign policy. This threatened to have severe 
effects on our relations with Ukraine and a number of other CIS 
states, threatened Russia's ability to function as a partner in 
disarmament negotiations such as SALT II, and disturbed Russia's 
relations with the countries of Eastern Europe. 
  The explosive nature of the situation in Russia was clearly 
evident to those attending a session of the CSCE's Council of 
Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Stockholm in December 1992. The 
dramatic reaction abroad to my presentation of a number of 
points from the platforms of what were by no means the most 
extreme right-wing movements and forces in Russia gave food for 
thought about the profound isolation -- probably like in 1917 -- 
in which our country would find itself should they come to 
power. Stockholm also demonstrated the effective absence of any 
non-imperialist, neo-Atlantic alternative as has been 
speculatively put forward by politicians of a "moderate" 
orientation. 
  Additional organizational measures undertaken at the 
president's initiative have strengthened the ministry's position 
in its area of jurisdiction within the system of federal 
executive bodies. Specifically, in November 1992 a presidential 
directive assigned to the MFA coordination of a unified foreign 
policy course, though that goal is still far from realization -- 
differences among the approaches of various ministries and 
agencies, and in some cases "ministerial politicians," 
particularly in "hot spots," are seriously undermining Russia's 
strategic positions. 
  Everything that has been achieved in the field of foreign 
policy (plus some losses and some tactical failures) are the 
result of the Russian leadership's pursuit of Russia's national 
and state interests. The events of October 1993 graphically 
demonstrated the efforts of those who oppose reforms to slow 
their steady progress. The decisive position taken at that time 
by Russia's president received broad international support. The 
adoption of the Constitution and creation of the Federal 
Assembly should provide a new impetus for the implementation of 
full-scale reforms and take the country to new heights in 
international politics.

  By edict of the president of the Russian Federation, the 
following people are appointed: 
  KENYAYKIN, Valeriy Fedorovich, Extraordinary and 
Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the 
Republic of Italy and the Republic of San Marino, a combined 
position. 
  V. F. Kenyaykin, born 1946, a Russian. In 1970 graduated

<F P=106> [Interview with G. B. Karasin, director of the RF MFA </F>
[Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs] Information and 
Press Department, conducted by DIPLOMATICHESKIY VESTNIK 
correspondent: "A Subject of Particular Attention"] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Grigoriy Borisovich, the topic of 
cadre changes within the system of the MFA of Russia is once 
again becoming the subject of particular attention of our mass 
media. Practically every new appointment of a Russian ambassador 
abroad is perceived as a sensation. Journalists often ask you 
questions at briefings regarding such appointments. How can this 
be explained? 
  [Karasin] The interest of the press, and also of Russian 
society as a whole, in the MFA cadre policy is quite 
understandable. We are speaking of those people who are 
entrusted with the task of ensuring the foreign policy of our 
state. 
  We must remember that the MFA system is a living, moving 
organism which is in a state of permanent dynamics. Along with 
specialization by states and regions, high level diplomats 
develop a universality. This makes is possible to use them in 
any section of the diplomatic service. At the same time, work in 
the central apparatus in Moscow is alternated with long- and 
short-term assignments abroad. The rotation of cadres along the 
horizontal and the vertical refreshes the professional training 
of the diplomat and facilitates the development of a new, 
non-ordinary view of the problems and a creative approach to 
their solution. Therefore, when we speak of the appointment of 
deputy ministers or heads of certain departments as ambassadors, 
this is certainly not a cause for sensation, but rather, on the 
contrary--a confirmation of the established practice. 
  I would like to emphasize one other delicate moment 
associated with the appointment of ambassadors. The fact is that 
after approval of one or another candidacy in Moscow, the 
leadership of the state where the envoy is being sent must give 
an agreement--official consent as to his appointment. Therefore, 
until the agreement is given we cannot say that the ambassador 
has been appointed. Today no one makes any secret of the 
appointment of new ambassadors, and as soon as this becomes a 
fact the information is publicized. 
  [Correspondent] The mechanism of appointment of Russian 
ambassadors evokes interest, and primarily the criteria for 
selection of candidates to work in the highest diplomatic post 
abroad. Are there any standard documents regulating the activity 
and defining the rights and responsibilities of ambassadors? 
  [Karasin] There are two main criteria for the selection of 
cadres for diplomatic work--devotion to the state interests of 
Russia, and a proper understanding and professional ability to 
defend these interests and to solve the problems posed by the 
leadership of the country. 
  An Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the 
Russian Federation is a notable figure in many respects. He 
represents not the MFA, but the state, and it is the ambassador 
who largely determines the image of Russia. Moreover, the 
ambassador is the head of what is often a rather large 
collective of Russian representatives, and of the Russian colony 
in the country as a whole. For this reason, he must have special 
business and personal qualities, a high professional level, and 
an overall competency in area studies and international affairs. 
  We must note that in our country, as in others, not only are 
career diplomats appointed as ambassadors, but quite often also 
state leaders, leading scientists and journalists. In their 
practical affairs such ambassadors rely on their life 
experience, as well as on professional diplomatic workers. 
  Standard statutes regulating the activity of the diplomatic 
service, including that of ambassadors, to my knowledge, have 
been developed. However, as yet they have not been ratified, 
since the former Supreme Soviet did not adopt the law on state 
service. The question thus remains open for the present time. 
  [Correspondent] What are the results of the reform of the 
MFA 
which began approximately two years ago? Has it been possible to 
create more effective and efficient structures of the Russian 
diplomatic service? What difficulties have been encountered 
along the way? 
  [Karasin] Reform was not painless for us, since it touched 
upon human lives. However, it became necessary, since it was 
caused by the cardinal domestic political changes taking place 
in the country and by the need to give Russia a new image on the 
international arena. 
  We are able to retain a core of experienced and promising 
diplomats. And they, I am sure, will be able to withstand 
various temptations to go over to the world of business. Today 
we are experiencing practically the same material difficulties 
which scientists, doctors, teachers and other workers in the 
budget sphere experience. However, we like our work and do not 
intend to leave it. 
  Nothing in the world stands still, everything evolves. That 
is the case also in diplomacy. Therefore, the organizational 
modifications will continue. Thus, at a meeting of the MFA 
governing board held on 12 November, decisions were adopted 
regarding continued activization of work with the CIS countries 
and the introduction of appropriate changes into the structure 
of individual subdivisions. This, I might add, does not foresee 
any reductions. 
  [Correspondent] Will the appearance of numerous parties and 
movements on the domestic political landscape of Russia 
influence its foreign policy? What effect will the existence of 
different viewpoints on current international problems have on 
the activity of the Russian representations abroad? 
  [Karasin] The MFA and the Russian embassies abroad have been 
and will continue to be all-state institutions. Under conditions 
of political pluralism, we are interested in a constructive 
interaction with all political powers and parties. One of the 
most important tasks of the MFA under the new conditions is to 
explain the essence of Russian positions on the entire spectrum 
of international problems. Foreign policy must be understood and 
accepted by millions of Russians. 
  And one more thing. As a result of the various domestic 
political processes and the struggle of ambitions, a stream of 
entirely unsubstantiated accusations has recently poured down 
upon the Russian diplomatic service. Diplomats in the center and 
in the embassies were in essence subjected to a constant 
moral-psychological pressure which, frankly speaking, did not 
facilitate a strengthening of the prestige of our Homeland and 
its representatives. After all, to discuss foreign political 
problems and to criticize individual actions does not mean to 
thoughtlessly defame our own diplomats. We must evidently 
realize that Russia has no alternative diplomatic service. The 
only structure for implementing foreign policy is the MFA of 
Russia. I believe that Russians do not doubt the ability of our 
diplomats to defend our country's interests.

<F P=106> [Article by B. Finoheyev, candidate of technical sciences, </F>
H. Bodner, candidate of economic sciences, V. Kolesnyk 
(Simferopol): "The Current State of and Prospects for Employment 
of Repatriated Crimean Tatar Population"] 
  [Text] The Republic of Crimea has elected the path of 
introducing radical changes in the socioeconomic life of its 
population. The development of the resort and recreational, 
agricultural, and industrial complexes, as well as the service 
industry, are under way, and the region's productive forces are 
growing. The degree to which these resources are utilized fully 
and effectively, especially the republic's manpower resources, 
will greatly determine the future development of the region. 
  The transition to market relations has ushered in certain 
changes in the situation. Some branches of the Crimean economy 
are still experiencing a manpower shortage, but, at the same 
time, there is a growing reduction in labor forces both in the 
sphere of material production and in a number of branches of the 
nonproductive sectors. In addition, the employment problem is 
being exacerbated by the return to Crimea, their historical 
homeland, of the Crimean Tatars and citizens of other 
nationalities. 
  The attempt to solve problems associated with the return of 
deported citizens and providing them with jobs is encountering 
many difficulties caused by a large number of economic, social, 
demographic, psychological, and other factors. In particular, 
data on the labor potential of the citizens who have returned 
from their place of residence in deportation is either lacking 
or needs to be more precise. It is important both in qualitative 
and quantitative terms to determine trends in changes in this 
population's structure and reproduction. All this creates a need 
for more intensive scientific study of the problems pertaining 
to the utilization of human resources and the creation of new 
economic, legal, and organizational forms and methods of 
providing the population with jobs. 
  In view of this, the Crimean branch of the Ukrainian 
Scientific-Research Institute of Labor of the Ministry of Labor 
of Ukraine and the Committee for the Affairs of Deported 
Nationalities of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of 
Crimea are jointly conducting scientific studies for the purpose 
of finding ways to solve the task of utilizing the labor of 
deported citizens who have returned. 
  This article does not examine the question of employment as 
it relates to all deported peoples who have returned to the 
peninsula, but only as it relates to citizens of Crimean Tatar 
nationality, who predominate among the returnees (91%). 
  The Crimean peninsula has attracted many tribes and peoples 
since ancient times. The population of the Crimea has never been 
ethnically homogeneous. Diverse ethnic communities formed and 
coexisted here for many centuries. 
  According to the census conducted in April 1921, the Crimean 
Tatars made up 25.9% of the Crimea's total population of 
721,000. Although by the beginning of 1939, the number of 
Crimean Tatars had grown to 218,000, their proportion to the 
total population of the Crimea fell to 19.4%. In prewar 
1940, 
the number of residents of Crimean Tatar nationality totalled 
220,000. 
  The peoples of the Crimea were harshly tested by their 
common 
struggle against fascist aggression. During these same years, 
beginning with August 1941, 50,000 German residents of the 
peninsula were resettled inland, and in May 1944, 188,000 
Crimean Tatars were deported to the eastern regions of the USSR. 
Somewhat later, 14,000 Greeks, 12,000 Bulgarians, and 11,000 
Armenians were also deported. 
  The obvious outcome of this was that there were virtually no 
Crimean Tatars in the Crimea in the years following the war. 
Only since 1967 did Crimean Tatar families begin returning to 
the Crimean Oblast as part of an organized resettlement. This 
process progressed slowly and was not consistent in nature. 
  The years 1987 to 1989 were characterized by intensified 
migration of Crimean Tatars to the Crimea, primarily from the 
Central Asian republics. In the ten years between two censuses 
(1979-1989), the Crimean Tatar population in the Crimea 
increased by 33,000 and reached 39,400 [as published] persons to 
constitute 1.6\52000060100f the total population of the Crimea. The 
year 1989 marked the beginning of a mass return of this deported 
people. Between 1990 and 1992, 134,000 Crimean Tatars returned 
to their homeland, and the total number of citizens of Crimean 
Tatar nationality living the Crimea reached 204,000 or 
7.7% of 
the peninsula's total population (see table). 
  It is difficult to predict how the process of repatriation 
of 
this deported people will proceed, inasmuch as there is no exact 
figure indicating the number of Crimean Tatars expected to 
return. Existing data are of a contradictory nature. Moreover, 
they are founded more on emotion than on well-considered 
estimates. 
  The majority of those who have returned reside in Crimea's 
rural districts and have begun to build homes. Many of them work 
in various spheres of the national economy and are engaged in 
socially useful work.

  The legislative acts and decisions relating to various 
aspects of the repatriation of the Crimean Tatars attest that a 
certain amount of attention has been devoted to the problem of 
restoring the constitutional rights of deported peoples and to 
the return of the Crimean Tatars to their homeland. The 
implementation of these directives has produced a number of 
positive features: 
  -- a Plan for the Settlement and Employment of Crimean 
Tatars 
in the Crimea has been worked out; 
  -- the rayons of Crimean Tatar settlement and the yearly 
quotas for their distribution have been defined for the years 
1991-95; accordingly, a Plan for the Distribution of Productive 
Forces has been drafted, the number of needed jobs calculated, 
and the necessary social and consumer infrastructure determined; 
  -- restrictions on residence permits for Crimean Tatars have 
been lifted; 
  -- plots of land for building individual houses are being 
allotted; 
  -- the following enterprises have been created to provide 
jobs for Crimean Tatars: 
  a) two state farms: the Ahrarnyy State Farm in Pervomayske 
and the Vodopiynyy State Farm in Chornomorske rayons; 
  b) two collective farms: the Avdet Collective Farm in 
Rozdolne and the Batan Collective Farm in Lenine rayons; 
  c) the Krymahrospetsbud-2 trust and the BPMK [expansion not 
given] in Simferopol and the PMK [Mobile Mechanized Column] in 
Yevpatoriya; 
  d) the Berekety agrofirm in Simferopol; 
  e) the Seltemp building association and seven small 
enterprises (Simferopol, Bakhchysaray, Yalta, Krasnoperekopsk); 
  -- construction is under way of a pedagogical school to 
train 
elementary school teachers of Crimean Tatar nationality; 
  -- one of the deputy chairmen of the Council of Ministers of 
the Republic of Crimea is a Crimean Tatar; there is a Crimean 
Tatar deputy to the Crimean Supreme Council; 
  -- law enforcement organs, statistical institutions, and 
other organizations have lately begun to devote serious 
attention to repatriation affairs. The Ministry of Labor of 
Ukraine is financing scientific-research projects studying the 
employment of Crimean Tatars in the economy of the Crimea. 
  All these things will undoubtedly produce an effect in the 
near future with respect to solving questions pertaining to 
raising the living standard and providing jobs for Crimean 
Tatars. Still, despite the work that has already been done in 
the realm of resolving the problem of the return and settlement 
of the Crimean Tatars, a number of measures outlined in the 
directives remain unimplemented. 
  National employment policy is formulated at the state level, 
and its objective is to guarantee equal job opportunities for 
all citizens of the state, irrespective of nationality and place 
of residence. 
  The processes of privatization, destatization, and 
development of various forms of ownership that are under way are 
producing a growing shift of blue- and white-collar workers from 
state-owned enterprises, institutions, and organizations to 
collectively owned entities and into the sphere of private 
enterprise. This movement of labor reserves requires state 
regulation and the safeguarding of social guarantees for 
citizens. There are now manpower reserves in the cities of the 
Crimea. As a result, the problem of jobs for the population is 
becoming increasingly acute. 
  In light of this situation, the interdependence between the 
interests of society and those of the individual is very 
important. It should also be kept in mind that at this stage of 
the development of the Crimea's economy, a number of factors 
that complicate the placement of laid-off and unemployed workers 
will have a perceptible negative effect. One such factor is the 
increase in labor resources owing to the return of the Crimean 
Tatars. That is why those government organs and their structural 
subdivisions that deal with matters of employment have a special 
task: to assist citizens in exercising their right to work more 
rapidly and in filling the demand for manpower; creating new 
jobs; providing support in the job market for those categories 
of citizens who are poorly protected (young people, women who 
are raising children, persons approaching retirement age, 
invalids); preventing a high unemployment rate and alleviating 
the negative effects of unemployment. 
  In order to study the composition of the returning 
able-bodied population by sex, age, educational level, and 
professional skills, as well as to discover the principal causes 
of unemployment, to determine the number of people who want to 
find work as soon as possible and the length of time it takes to 
find a job, and other data, this study included a survey 
conducted with the help of a questionnaire administered to both 
employed and unemployed residents of the Crimea. In April and 
May of 1993, 1,500 questionnaires were distributed among the 
Crimean Tatars. In addition, the text of the questionnaire was 
published in the newspaper YAN"Y DYUN'YA, which appears in the 
Crimean Tatar language (circulation 15,000). 
  Unfortunately, however, the question of jobs has not yet 
become a top priority for the Committee [for the Affairs of 
Deported Nationalities], nor for its local representatives, nor 
even for the Crimean Tatar people themselves. As a result, by 1 
July 1993, we received back only 48 of 1,500 questionnaires and 
25 letters in response to the questions published in the 
newspaper. This insufficiency of data prevented us from 
compiling a full description of the composition of the returning 
able-bodied population on the basis of the questionnaires. It 
was possible to discern only one trend: those who want to return 
to the Crimea are willing to take any kind of job, while those 
who have already returned and are now residing in the Crimea, 
want to find work in the professions they worked in earlier. 
  Since the passage of the Law of the UkrSSR "On the 
Employment 
of the Population," the same job placement services as those 
serving all unemployed citizens have been finding jobs for 
persons of Crimean Tatar nationality -- in other words, priority 
is given to their professional qualifications. 
  Another fact that cannot be ignored is that Crimea's labor 
resources are unequally distributed on a large part of the 
peninsula. As a result, it is not always possible to take into 
account the specific features of individual cities, rayons, let 
alone individual groups of residents, when solving general 
economic tasks. This, unquestionably, affects employment and 
creates new problems in the utilization of manpower. Hence, 
reducing territorial disparities in terms of the employment rate 
is assuming greater urgency, especially in this phase of Crimean 
Tatar repatriation and job placement. Equalizing employment 
rates by territories does not mean establishing absolutely equal 
indices, but rather ensuring that the demand for jobs among the 
population is met to an equal degree everywhere. 
  An analysis of Crimean Tatar employment in territorial terms 
shows that the majority of them work in Crimea's rural districts 
(85% of the total number of working Crimean Tatars). An 
analogous indicator characterizing the employment of the total 
population in the rayons measures 41%. Nearly 7,000 
Crimean 
Tatars are employed in the cities (1.1% of the total 
number of 
people working in cities and 15% of the total number of 
working 
Crimean Tatars). The reason that such a small number of Crimean 
Tatars work in resort cities is that fewer members of this 
ethnic group live in these cities, which, in turn, stems from 
the fact that they received residence permits much later. Thus, 
only 19 Crimean Tatars work in Yalta and 148 in Alushta. 
  An analysis by the republic's rayons indicates that the 
overwhelming majority of Crimean Tatars works in Bilohirsk 
Rayon. Here, the Crimean Tatars account for 2.5% of the 
total 
number of those employed in the Crimea, while the analogous 
indicator for the Crimean Tatar population measures 
10.2%. Many 
Crimean Tatars also work in the Krasnohvardiyske (7.5% of 
the 
total number of employed Crimean Tatars), Dzhankoy (7.4%), 
Kirovske (7.1%), Saky (6.9%), and Bakhchysaray 
(6.8%) rayons. 
  A study of Crimean Tatar employment by branches of the 
economy showed that the largest number of Crimean Tatars are 
employed in the republic's agricultural sector -- 26,700 of 
46,000 persons, or 58.1%. Many Crimean Tatars work in the 
health care field (3,200 or 7.0%) and in industry (2,600 
or 
5.8%). On the average, the predominating fields in which 
Crimean Tatars are employed in the cities are industry 
(16.7% 
of the total number of Crimean Tatars employed in cities), 
transport (16.4%), construction (13.8%), and 
health care 
(13.4%). 
  As we know, an increase in the size of the able-bodied 
population produces the need for a corresponding increase in 
jobs. This will not pose a problem in areas of compact Crimean 
Tatar settlement, where the development of agricultural 
production, as well as of the processing and other industries 
and of construction, will proceed hand in hand with the 
development of a social infrastructure, which will create jobs 
in the fields of public education, medicine, culture, and art. A 
significant portion of those engaged in intellectual work who 
settled in the cities and large population centers (especially 
resort centers) is encountering difficulties in finding work. 
This problem as regards this and other forms of employment will 
continue to worsen as the construction of housing is completed 
and the need to provide jobs for a large number of Crimean 
Tatars grows. In all probability, the process of economic 
stabilization will take a long time, and the unemployment rate 
will rise. Engineering and technical personnel and white-collar 
workers are already encountering difficulties in finding jobs. 
As a rule, they will be forced to undergo retraining and change 
their professions. The number of unemployed in the job market 
will also increase in large measure on account of the Crimean 
Tatars. 
  The problem of providing jobs for Crimean Tatars can be 
largely solved by compact settlement. These are the regions 
where the necessary enterprises should be established and new 
jobs created. Consequently, the priority directions should be: 
  -- utilizing existing employment reserves, that is, filling 
vacancies and jobs where possible; 
  -- developing a social infrastructure in the areas of 
Crimean 
Tatar settlement, which includes: a) meeting the needs of the 
population for retail services, public catering, and consumer 
services, and ensuring that the number of these meet the 
necessary standards; b) expanding and rebuilding a functional 
network of preschool institutions, general-education schools 
(where necessary -- in the native language), and medical, 
cultural, and artistic establishments; 
  -- increasing the production capacities of construction 
organizations and enterprises manufacturing building materials; 
  -- intensifying the development of agriculture and 
organizing 
a modern base for preserving and processing production; creating 
the necessary conditions for the effective utilization of 
Crimean Tatar labor in the agroindustrial complex, raising their 
interest in the results of their work, taking stock of and 
applying the national skills of the Crimean Tatars in the 
development of traditional occupations -- vegetable growing, 
tobacco cultivation, orcharding, viticulture, sheep breeding, 
horse breeding (mainly in areas of compact settlement); 
promoting the development of subsidiary, private farm, and 
leased farm enterprises; 
  -- promoting greater specialization in the light and food 
industries and increasing the output of these industries to the 
level needed to meet popular demand; 
  -- developing (along with state ownership) and strengthening 
of collective, joint-stock, cooperative, and other forms of 
ownership; 
  -- stimulating the growth of enterprises with any form of 
ownership that are engaged in providing various services to the 
population; 
  -- increasing the level of economic development in a number 
of rayons located in the steppe region of the peninsula by 
increasing the number of ettlements and developing a production 
infrastructure and new agroindustrial complexes in them; 
  -- reviving national folk crafts, etc. 
  In order to alleviate the unfavorable economic and 
demographic situation, increase the employment rate, and improve 
the effectiveness with which labor potential is utilized, we 
feel that we can recommend to the Council of Ministers of the 
Republic of Crimea that it pass a resolution granting the right 
to all citizens who possess a Crimean residence permit to obtain 
employment at any enterprise in the Crimea regardless of place 
of residence. 
  An investigation of such a complex and many-sided subject 
cannot pretend to offer a comprehensive analysis of the 
questions studied, nor guarantee the accuracy of its 
conclusions. Some proposals have been put forward as subjects 
for further discussion. In addition, future studies need to be 
adjusted to take into account the time that has passed and the 
practical materials that have been gathered.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jurgis Jurgelis, general director of the </F>
Lithuanian Department of Security, by Gintaras Visockas; place 
and date not given: "Jurgis Jurgelis: `It's Not With a Great 
Deal of Enthusiasm That I Talk to Journalists...'"] 
  [Excerpts] We talked with Jurgis Jurgelis, general director 
of the Lithuanian Department of Security, at his office. Instead 
of lasting the 15 or 20 minutes which the director had agreed to 
grant ATGIMIMAS prior to our meeting, our conversation went on 
for almost an hour. He was interrupted several times by 
telephone calls: journalists from other publications wanting to 
meet with him... [passage omitted] 
  [Visockas] Do you stay in touch with colleagues in Estonia 
and Latvia? Are your relations with Riga and Tallinn close, 
moderately close, or still rather distant? 
  [Jurgelis] I have to confess that our ties are very meager. 
Our presidents spend time together, our prime ministers rub 
shoulders, our foreign ministries associate with each other, but 
as for us, well, unfortunately... Why? Stability is needed, but 
for the time being, there is no stability in the Lithuanian 
Department of Security. The most important reason for this is 
the turnover of chiefs of the security service. What kind of 
long-term cooperation can be established if our service is still 
only starting to establish itself? So this is one of the main 
reasons why there hasn't been a closer association with the 
colleagues from Riga and Tallinn, despite the fact that there 
are certainly common interests, such as the hostile activity of 
foreign countries, narcotics, weapons smuggling... 
  [Visockas] Do you keep in touch with the Russian security 
service? Are the ties friendly? Are they necessary? 
  [Jurgelis] Yes, they are necessary, if for no other reason 
than that Lithuania wants to get documents back--the files of 
people who previously worked in the Soviet KGB. A state 
commission, to which I also belong, has been formed, and a month 
ago, we sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to hand over those files to the Republic of Lithuania. 
We have not, however, received a reply thus far. Our cooperation 
with Russian security ought to begin when we get these files 
back. Getting these files back, as far as I know, is a concern 
of not only the Lithuanian security service. 
  [Visockas] What should be the level of association with the 
security services of the Russian Federation? 
  [Jurgelis] We need to make up our own minds on this. Let's 
say that Poland signed an agreement with Russia on cooperation 
in the areas of narcotics and weapons smuggling. This kind of 
cooperation has nothing in common with politics. 
  [Visockas] How do you assess the performance of the 
institution which you head? 
  [Jurgelis] I could only assign a very low grade. Our 
institution is still in the process of getting established. 
Indeed, none of the people whom M. Laurinkus brought along with 
him are still here. We are all newcomers. It is bad that our 
functions are not yet fully regulated by laws: Seimas has been 
deliberating a draft law on the security service for half a year 
now; last time barely ten minutes were allotted for deliberation 
of the draft; I had time to say only a few words and the members 
of Seimas managed to get in only a few responses... 
  What we are especially lacking in our service are trained 
personnel, i.e. workers with a higher education who are 
sufficiently young and are able to think analytically. The 
prestige of the Lithuanian security service has fallen. There is 
no heavy influx of people; we don't have a large pool to select 
from. Low salaries, no doubt, are at fault for this. 
  Very soon, security service workers will have to recertify, 
and we will have to let some less promising workers go. This may 
lead to something of a scandal in the public. 
  On the other hand, though, this service holds promise for 
young, talented, patriotically disposed people. Salaries, too, 
will rise, and there will also be opportunities for training 
assignments abroad. Those who regard us as the incarnation of 
evil do so without foundation. 
  [Visockas] The publishing house MINTIS has published a book, 
"The Secret Services of Lithuania: 1918-1940". Have you read it? 
  [Jurgelis] This is the first book about Lithuania's secret 
services, so it should be popular. I had the opportunity to rub 
shoulders with A. Anusauskas, its author. But so far, I haven't 
had time to read the book carefully. 
  [Visockas] You can't fit it in? 
  [Jurgelis] That's correct, I can't. Those who know how to 
work have free time, but I could not yet count myself in their 
company. I am not yet able to organize my work in such a way 
that a few free hours remain each day. 
  [Visockas] Did your relations to your family, friends, and 
acquaintances change when you became head of the security 
service? 
  [Jurgelis] I associate with my family and my close friends 
in 
the same way that I did before. It seems, however, that 
relations with acquaintances have changed somewhat. Now, people 
sometimes look at me with suspicion, with a certain degree of 
distrust.

<F P=106> [Text of "Ashgabat Declaration on the Development of </F>
Cooperation and Consolidation of Trust in Relations Among 
Members of the Commonwealth of Independent States"] 
  [Text] Ashgabat Declaration on the Development of 
Cooperation and Consolidation of Trust in Relations among 
Members of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
  We, the heads of state of the members of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, having assembled in the city of Ashgabat on 
24 December 1993, observe that despite the complex and 
contradictory features of the formative stage of the 
Commonwealth it has become a political and economic reality of 
the contemporary world. A legal basis has been laid, and organs 
of multilateral cooperation in economics, defense, and foreign 
policy have been established and are functioning. The 
Coordinating-Consulting Committee and the Executive Secretariat 
of the Commonwealth have begun active operations. A unified 
economic space is being formed, although it is not simple, on 
the basis of the Treaty on Formation of the Economic Union. 
  We declare our sincere resolution in carrying out the will 
of 
the peoples of our states to broaden and strengthen the 
traditional, historically established relations of friendship, 
cooperation and mutual understanding among our states on a new 
basis. 
  In the given historical stage, under the difficult 
conditions 
of the transitional period, it is vitally important to preserve 
everything good that bound our peoples together through the 
centuries of common history in politics, economics, culture, 
humanitarian ties, and personal dealings and on this basis 
develop cooperation on a qualitatively new level. Respect for 
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the states, mutual 
trust and openness, renunciation of the use of force, the threat 
of force, and economic pressure, resolving disputes by peaceful 
means, non-intervention in internal affairs, conscientious 
performance of obligations assumed, and mutually advantageous 
partnership should become the foundation of interstate relations. 
  It is essential to be aware of the exceptional nature of 
this 
stage in the life of our peoples, who are living through not 
just a political and economic transformation, but also a 
profound psychological change, growth in national 
self-awareness, and the rebirth of their own spiritual cultures. 
  Under these conditions we, the heads of states, politicians, 
as well as cultural, scientific, and artistic figures, and all 
the citizens of our states must show balance in evaluations of 
one another and an attitude of cherishing the priceless heritage 
acquired by our peoples and the possibility of civilized 
development on the basis of sovereign equality in the system of 
international relations. 
  We affirm that the most important thing, on whose behalf we 
aspire to strengthen trust among ourselves, is international 
consensus as the highest political, ethical, and human value. 
  The members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, in 
introducing their national currencies, will strive to establish 
free, civilized exchange of national currencies and solve 
problems in mutual payments. This should create the objective 
conditions for evaluating the possibility of forming a payment 
and currency union by stages. 
  We all need one another's support, cooperation, and mutual 
understanding today. The future of our peoples, security, 
stability, and peace and tranquility in the homes of simple 
people depend directly on the level of trust among the members 
of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  We, the heads of state and also of governments, must show 
maximum wisdom, good will, and responsibility and do everything 
possible to perform the obligations assumed by the Commonwealth. 
Willingness to reach reasonable compromises will make it 
possible, without infringing on the interests of sovereign 
states, to progress along a constructive path and jointly shape 
an effective treaty-law basis for our cooperation in the name of 
the flourishing of our peoples. 
  The experience of the 2 years of existence of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States convinces us that 
constructive dialogue, multilateral consultation, and 
consideration and respect for the positions of the partner 
foster a real consolidation of the political and economic 
independence of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States and help them achieve a high level of integration. 
  The Commonwealth of Independent States has demonstrated its 
openness in practice. Its participants have grown. While 
permitting each state to realize its own choice as to political 
and economic order according to its own specific features and 
nationality characteristics, participation in the Commonwealth 
has created the necessary political and socioeconomic conditions 
for building a democratic society in each of them. 
  The sovereign members of the Commonwealth, as independent 
and 
equal subjects of international law, preserve to themselves the 
right to participate in world and regional organizations. 
  Recognizing the importance of maintaining peace and 
stability 
within and among the countries of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, the heads of state of the Commonwealth 
members have agreed on the need for new efforts to strengthen 
the peace-making potential of their states. Expressing concern 
at the continuing armed conflicts arising on the soil of 
expansionism, nationalism, chauvinism, xenophobia, and religious 
intolerance, the participants of the Ashgabat meeting take note 
of the importance of efforts to bring these phenomena to a 
prompt end and are filled with determination to broaden 
cooperation with one another in this sphere and do everything 
necessary, including collective measures aimed at peaceful 
settlement of armed conflicts and eliminating the causes that 
lead to their occurrence in the future. 
  We, the heads of the states of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, expressing the will of our peoples, declare 
our readiness to do everything we can to ensure a normal life 
for people, provide them with social guarantees, prevent forced 
migration, and ensure conditions for economic stabilization and 
the realization of large-scale development programs. 
  We express our profound conviction that the political, 
economic, and humanitarian potential of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States is a powerful guarantee that the historic 
challenges facing our peoples will be met.

<F P=106> [Article: "Statement of the Council of Ministers and </F>
Government of the Russian Federation, 22 November"] 
  [Text] While in the zone of the Karabakh conflict with a 
peacemaking mission, on 20 November of this year V. N. 
Kazimirov, a special envoy of the president of the Russian 
Federation and ambassador for special commissions, and persons 
accompanying him were subjected to intensive fire from the 
Armenian side while crossing the Azeri-Armenian border in the 
vicinity of the city of Kazakh on the basis of an agreement with 
the administration of the president of Armenia. One vehicle was 
hit and burned. Two Azeri servicemen providing security to the 
Russian envoy were wounded. 
  The government of the Russian Federation decisively condemns 
this unprecedented action grossly violating the rules of 
international law, and demands and immediate public apology from 
the supreme leadership of Armenia and a guarantee of unwavering 
provision of security in the future to Russian envoys on 
official missions. The government of the Russian Federation 
firmly expects that the culprits in this malicious act will be 
tried, and reserves the right to take the most decisive steps in 
order to preclude repetition of such incidents.

Affairs A. V. Kozyrev and Personal Envoy of the RF President, 
Ambassador for Special Commissions and the Leader of the Russian 
Mediation Mission for Peaceful Settlement in Nagornyy Karabakh 
V. N. Kazimirov, 22 November"] 
  [Text] 
  [Kozyrev] What we are talking about is a truly extraordinary 
incident that will be related in detail by V. N. Kazimirov. 
Unfortunately this isn't just simply an incident. The impression 
is created that politics are behind it. I'll be happy if my 
impression is proven wrong, but this will depend now on swift 
and determined actions, chiefly by the Armenian leadership. 
  Let me acquaint you with the text of the Statement of the 
Council of Ministers and Government of the Russian Federation. 
The statement speaks for itself. I can add that we have already 
been waiting 2 days for an official explanation from the 
Armenian side. I discussed this in my first statement right 
after information on this incident became known. Unfortunately 
all I've received so far is an incomprehensible paper from 
Armenian Minister of Foreign Affairs V. A. Papazyan, which I 
can't accept, and on the basis of which further contact with him 
is hardly possible. 
  I would like to say that we believe the version of this 
incident told by the Russian personal envoy of the president, 
who was directly conducting negotiations with Armenian leaders 
at that moment. I have to believe my own ears, because I had a 
telephone conversation with Armenian President L. Ter-Petrosyan, 
and by the way with Azeri President G. Aliyev as well; moreover 
this mission was being conducted on the basis of a personal 
agreement in accordance with instructions from the RF president. 
  One more remark. There has recently been considerable 
discussion of our position regarding protection of the 
Russian-language population. I must say firmly that we will 
closely protect the Russian-language population, and defend its 
interests and Russian interests, no matter where this happens 
and no matter in whose presence, even if these are our friends. 
In this case I'm referring to Armenia. The attitude toward 
Russian official envoys, Russian servicemen and compatriots on 
the territory of any state, be it in the near or far frontier, 
will be the touchstone upon which the sincerity of friendly 
relations, and of the possibility in general of any 
good-neighbor relations with any state, will be proven. And 
transgressions upon these persons will be viewed in the minimum 
as an unfriendly act, and in the absence of a swift and 
determined reaction to rectify such a situation the most 
decisive measures will follow immediately, automatically, as 
emphasized in the Statement of the RF President. I can assure 
you that we need not wait long for the most decisive steps to be 
taken in this case. 
  [Kazimirov] In accordance with A. V. Kozyrev's telephone 
conversations with the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia and 
with leaders of Nagornyy Karabakh, a special envoy of the RF 
president was sent to Baku, Yerevan and Stepanakert to work out 
specific issues concerning cessation of military activities in 
this conflict. 
  After a few days in Baku it became necessary to go first to 
Yerevan and then to Stepanakert. It was arranged on the basis of 
a suggestion by authorities from the administration of the 
president of the Armenian Republic that the Armenian-Azeri 
border would be crossed in the vicinity of the Azeri city of 
Kazakh. I must emphasize that this point has nothing in common 
geographically with Nagornyy Karabakh, it is in the northern 
part of the Armenian-Azeri border, far from Nagornyy Karabakh. 
Consequently the cast of characters consisted of the Armenian 
and Azeri sides, plus a Russian mediator. Such was the mutual 
understanding that was reached. We set off for the city of 
Kazakh. Unfortunately we arrived late, after dark, and therefore 
we had to postpone crossing the border to the morning of 20 
November. In the meantime the Azeri side made radio contact with 
the Armenian side, negotiations were conducted, and the place at 
which our group was to cross the Armenian border was designated. 
  At the very last moment the Armenian side raised objections, 
which is something that has already become an absurd tradition 
in the course of the conflict. Each time, coordination of the 
routes of travel of peacemaking missions--Russia's in this case 
and that of the SBSYe [not further identified]--has invariably 
transformed into an absurd contest between the sides as to what 
routes particular envoys are to travel. 
  But in any case the Armenian side--Yerevan, the 
administration of the president of the Armenian Republic--was 
quite well aware of the place to which the Azeris were going to 
take us. We arrived in this place at 10 o'clock in the morning 
of 20 November. Azeri Colonel Sadykhov, the regional commandant, 
implemented precautionary measures, and would not allow us to 
travel together as a single column, preferring instead that we 
waited behind a hill at the outskirts of the partially destroyed 
town while he sent only the lead vehicle forward. The vehicle 
was gone for 40 minutes, we were worried that something might 
have happened to it, since it takes no more than 15 minutes to 
drive there and back. We soon heard shots, isolated ones at 
first. We later found out that they were firing at the wheels of 
the Jeep occupied by the Azeri battalion commander and three 
private soldiers sent ahead with the purpose of reaching 
agreement with the Armenian side, after which the entire column 
was to begin moving. 
  The isolated shots were followed by automatic fire, and then 
a large-caliber weapon went into action. Experienced servicemen 
determined from the sounds of the shots that the fire was from a 
Shilka antiaircraft gun and from grenade launchers mounted on an 
APC. In any case this was intensive, coordinated fire, and not 
just one or two random shots, as was asserted. 
  It became clear that something happened with this vehicle, 
because all of the shots were heard in direct proximity. The 
Azeri soldiers tried to rescue the ones who were in trouble, but 
their attempts to approach were cut of by fire from the Armenian 
side. That's the way the incident developed. 
  It seems to me that the latest incident once again 
demonstrates the entire absurdity, the entire senselessness of 
this conflict, and it should encourage its fastest possible 
settlement. It is precisely toward this, toward cessation of 
fire and military activities, that the Russian mediation mission 
was working. 
  The participants of the press conference replied to 
questions from journalists. 
  [CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, USA] Can you talk in a little 
more detail about the explanations from the Armenian minister of 
foreign affairs? Why do you call them inadequate? 
  You said that decisive steps would be taken in the immediate 
future unless an adequate response is forthcoming from the 
Armenian government. What do you mean by "decisive steps" in 
this particular case? 
  [A. V. Kozyrev] I wouldn't want to go into the details now. 
What we're talking about is diplomatic exchange of notes, but in 
this case it all boils down to an attempt by the Armenian side 
to accuse, naturally, the other side, as is regularly done in 
the course of a conflict. Obviously there are times when it's 
hard to determine exactly who is responsible for a particular 
incident. I'm reminded in this connection of my own experience 
when I was in Karabakh last year. Many of my traveling 
companions--the military and my security service--assert that 
our helicopter was fired on between Stepanakert and Shusha (at 
that time Shusha was still in the hands of the Azeri side). But 
then first of all, it was rather difficult to determine the 
nature of the fire, because the helicopter wasn't hit, and 
second, it was impossible to make any conclusions and prove what 
side was firing, because we were in a zone between the two 
warring sides. 
  In the latter case--that's what I started with--we have all 
the grounds for believing the president's personal envoy and 
ambassador for special commissions, who has lengthy diplomatic 
experience, including in zones of conflict--not only in 
Karabakh, where he's already been working for 2 years with the 
mediation mission, but also in Angola. Such that he encountered 
nothing new either in the smell of gunpowder or in determining 
where the border was, and so on. The attempt to send me a note 
that was clearly based not on a wish to get to the bottom of the 
affair but on a desire to automatically deflect accusations 
can't be viewed as anything more than a personal attack. That's 
first. Second. The note contains the implication that if the 
appropriate interpretation isn't made, it would be difficult for 
V. N. Kazimirov to continue his mediation mission. I must say 
that if I were in the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I'd 
be worried about something else right now. Not about the choice 
of Russian diplomats to carry out peacemaking missions, but 
about a swift reaction to our offers. 
  This brings us to your second question. We're not talking 
about some kind of threats. I hope there aren't any 
"super-insightful" reporters around, Western or Russian, who are 
going to start talking about "neo-imperialism"--I don't wish to 
let my imagination run away with me, but I can probably say that 
if something similar happened at the level of a personal envoy 
of the country's president, and in such blatant form, in the 
case of an American diplomat in some part of the world for 
example, I think that we would have already seen an aircraft 
carrier within not binocular but visual range. This isn't 
"gunboat diplomacy," it's a policy of normal protection of one's 
interests and of citizens, supported by all of the rules of 
international law. 
  I repeat that I'm not going to let my imagination run away 
with me, but we are talking about the government's statement, 
which says distinctly and clearly that it "...reserves the right 
to take the most decisive steps." And because we're naturally 
assuming that this paper--I can't even call it a note--this 
paper that Mr. Papazyan sent isn't the opinion of the Armenian 
president, I think that there's still time. Frankly speaking I'm 
certain, I simply can't even imagine something different, all 
the more so because I personally reached agreement with 
President L. Ter-Petrosyan, whom I know very well, and I haven't 
the slightest doubt that no one is about to take matters to such 
an extreme, that what the statement calls for will be done 
swiftly--an official apology and immediate steps to punish those 
who are directly responsible for this act. 
  [Interfaks Agency, RF] Will Russia's peacemaking mission in 
Nagornyy Karabakh be continued? 
  What is Russia's relationship to Ukraine's nuclear drift in 
the course of ratification of the START-I Treaty by the 
Ukrainian Parliament? 
  [A. V. Kozyrev] What we need to do now is get to the bottom 
of this incident. Let me turn your attention once again to the 
text of the statement, which says that in this case primarily 
the Armenian leadership, and of course the other participants as 
well, would have to guarantee the necessary conditions for 
carrying out the mediation mission. We are not refusing to help. 
This is all being done incidentally at the request of the 
supreme leaders of these states, on the basis of agreements 
between the presidents, both written and oral, in close contact 
with the SBSYe. 
  I feel that we will of course continue providing aid in the 
appropriate forms, but I hope that this incident will help our 
partners to realize certain realities. 
  It may be that the parties to the conflict, including the 
Armenian side, have already essentially reached the point beyond 
which direct harm begins to be inflicted not only on the 
population drawn into these conflicts but also upon the national 
and state interests of Russia. This can do unpredictable harm 
both to the interests of Armenia and, let me repeat once again, 
the interests of Russia. Therefore I hope that the last 
incident, which is of independent significance, will help people 
to regain their senses in terms of general military policy in 
this region as well. 
  As far as Ukraine is concerned, I can say once again what I 
said before: This has nothing to do with some sort of 
Russian-Ukrainian dispute. It's a great pity certain SMI [not 
further identified], both here and in the West, render these 
problems precisely in this key. What we are talking about is 
whether the regime of nuclear nonproliferation will persist in 
Europe and in the world as a whole, or whether it will be 
brought down. After all, Article 1 of the Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons makes references precisely 
to rejection of nuclear weapons or the impossibility of 
possessing them. Unfortunately the Ukrainian Parliament's 
announcement made reference to their possession, to the notion 
that the nuclear warheads are Ukrainian property. Thus what 
we're essentially talking about is the first announcement in 
many decades of a direct violation of the regime of nuclear 
nonproliferation. This has nothing to do with Russian-Ukrainian 
ties, there's only the one fact. I am personally convinced that 
Russia is interested, perhaps even more than any other state, in 
preserving and strengthening the regime of nuclear 
nonproliferation, inasmuch as it is on the perimeter of our 
borders that their spread is probable. Understandably, violation 
of this regime by one state can quite possibly evoke a chain 
reaction. We already have North Korea, with which complex 
negotiations are being carried on, and as you know, we are 
displaying sufficient restraint and calm, but this question 
naturally continues to trouble us. We are in contact with the 
North Korean side. Collapse of the regime of nuclear 
nonproliferation is naturally impermissible to us. I'm certain 
that this is precisely the key in which the discussion on this 
question should proceed. As for whether the discussion will 
involve a possibility or a fait accompli will depend entirely on 
how Kiev itself interprets the parliament's decision. We know 
that there are nuances in the approaches, at least judging from 
press reports, in the approaches of the president and government 
on one hand and of the Supreme Soviet on the other. 
  All of this requires definite and precise clarification. 
Otherwise this is a decision that is doubtlessly equivalent to 
shaking up the entire system of modern international relations. 
Under the system that has evolved, there have been five nuclear 
states up until this time. With the disintegration of the Soviet 
Union and formation of the CIS, documents clearly and distinctly 
saying that only one nuclear state should remain on the 
territory of the former USSR were signed at the highest level in 
Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. In other words five 
officially existing nuclear powers must remain in the system of 
international relations. The Ukrainian Parliament's decision 
essentially says in legal language that there is now a sixth 
state that is openly and legally a possessor of nuclear weapons. 
This is a new international situation. 
  [LOS ANGELES TIMES, USA] What national interests is Russia 
pursuing in Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast? 
  In light of the approaching winter, it would be interesting 
to learn how Russia plans to change its aid to Armenia. Where 
can we get any specific information as to what Russia is doing 
in terms of social, military and other aid to Armenia and 
Azerbaijan? 
  [A. V. Kozyrev] Russia has a very broad spectrum of 
interests 
in Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, beginning with purely 
humanitarian (in the final analysis, this war is a tragedy) and 
ending with geostrategic. This region is a zone of special 
interests and special responsibility to us. We have historical 
ties with this region, including a long history of various sorts 
of legal international acts and agreements. Naturally none of 
this has been cancelled out, all of this still stands. And we of 
course will work to stop the war in the region. 
  Finally the widening of the conflict that recently occurred. 
What we are dealing with now is not the territory of Nagornyy 
Karabakh as it was in the past, but with territory extending far 
beyond all reasonable limits in the description of Nagornyy 
Karabakh itself. Matters have gone as far as streams of 
refugees, and situations creating a possibility in the region, 
or an excuse--we can call it different things--for drawing other 
forces into the conflict. You can understand why I'm talking 
about Russia's national and state interests. I personally saw to 
it that the corresponding leaders would know that we have our 
limit, beyond which the mediation mission could grow from 
persuasion into something else. In any case we can consider no 
only reinforcing the mission's efforts at persuasion and 
negotiation, but also other methods. I believe that this should 
be clear. 
  It is the Russian Federation that has the highest interests 
there. We highly value the interest shown in this region by the 
SBSYe, and we are working very actively with other states, but 
this is a region in which our interests are affected much more 
directly than the interests of many other states, including due 
to the presence of a Russian-language population there, our 
economic ties, and so on. 
  As far as specific information is concerned, I believe you 
can get it from the Russian Federation State Committee on 
Economic Cooperation With Member States of the Commonwealth. But 
if the situation doesn't change, I'm afraid that no specific 
information will be needed, things will remain at zero.

<F P=106> [Text: "Agreement between the Russian Federation and </F>
Turkmenistan on Regulation of Questions of Dual Citizenship"] 
  [Text] Agreement between the Russian Federation and 
Turkmenistan on Regulation of Questions of Dual Citizenship 
  The Russian Federation and Turkmenistan, hereinafter called 
the Parties, 
  for the purpose of further development of friendly relations 
between their two countries, 
  and aspiring toward just and humane regulation of questions 
related to dual citizenship, 
  have agreed as follows. 
<H5>  Article 1 </H5>
  1. Each of the Parties recognizes the right of its citizens 
to acquire the citizenship of the other Party without losing 
their first citizenship. 
  2. A citizen of one Party acquires citizenship of the other 
Party on the basis of a free expression of the citizen's will 
under conditions and by the procedure established by the laws of 
the Party whose citizenship is being acquired. 
<H5>  Article 2 </H5>
  Citizens of one Party who, before this Agreement goes into 
effect and at their own request, have received citizenship of 
the other Party without losing their former citizenship, keep 
citizenship in both Parties. 
<H5>  Article 3 </H5>
  1. Children whose parents at the moment of the child's birth 
were both citizens of both Parties become citizens of both 
Parties on birth. Before these children reach the age of 18 
years their parents may choose for the children citizenship in 
one of the Parties by renouncing citizenship of the other Party 
by joint written declaration. 
  If one of the parents has died or been deprived of parental 
rights before the child reaches the age of 18 years, the other 
parent keeps the right to choose the citizenship of the child. 
  In both parents acquire the citizenship of both Parties or 
if 
their citizenship in both Parties terminates, the citizenship of 
children who have not reached the age of 18 years changes 
accordingly. 
  If the citizenship of both parents in one of the Parties 
terminates and citizenship in the other Party is preserved (the 
same for both parents), the citizenship of children under the 
age of 18 years changes accordingly. 
  If one of the parents who is a citizen of both Parties 
ceases 
to be a citizen of one of the Parties, citizenship in the Party 
for children under the age of 18 years is determined by written 
agreement of the parents. 
  A change in the citizenship of children in the age bracket 
from 14 to 18 years is done only with their written consent. 
  2. Upon reaching the age of 18 years a person who is a 
citizen of both Parties may keep both citizenships or choose 
citizenship in one of the Parties by renouncing the citizenship 
of the other Party in a written declaration of renunciation of 
citizenship offered during the first year after reaching the age 
of 18 years. 
  3. The provisions of Points 1 and 2 of the present Article 
also apply to children where at the moment of the child's birth 
one parent was a citizen of both Parties and the other parent 
was a person without citizenship or unknown, as well as to 
adopted children who acquire citizenship in both Parties or lose 
this citizenship from the moment of adoption. 
  4. The declaration of renunciation of citizenship in one of 
the Parties according to Points 1 and 2 of the present Article 
is given to an authorized organ of the Party whose citizenship 
is being terminated. Depending on the place of the child's 
permanent residence such authorized organs may be internal 
affairs organs who deal with citizenship matters or a diplomatic 
office or consular institution of the appropriate Party. 
<H5>  Article 4 </H5>
  Persons who are citizens of both Parties terminate 
citizenship in one of the Parties according to the laws of the 
Party whose citizenship is being terminated. 
  No professional or other activity by persons who hold 
citizenship in both Parties can be grounds for terminating 
citizenship in either of the Parties. 
<H5>  Article 5 </H5>
  A person who holds citizenship in both Parties exercises in 
full the rights and liberties and bears in full the duties of a 
citizen of the Party in whose territory he resides permanently. 
  Social support for persons holding citizenship in both 
Parties is provided according to the laws of the Party in whose 
territory they are permanent residents, if not otherwise 
provided by appropriate agreements between the Parties. 
  Persons who hold citizenship in both Parties go through 
compulsory military service in the Party in whose territory they 
are residing permanently at the time of the call-up. Persons who 
hold citizenship in both Parties and have gone through 
compulsory military service in one of them are exempt from being 
drafted for military service in the other. 
<H5>  Article 6 </H5>
  Persons who hold citizenship in both Parties have the right 
to the protection and patronage of each of the Parties. The 
protection and patronage of these persons in a third country is 
provided by the Party in whose territory they are permanently 
residing or, at their request, by the other Party whose 
citizenship they also hold. 
<H5>  Article 7 </H5>
  Disputes between the Parties in connection with 
interpretation and application of the present Agreement are 
resolved through diplomatic channels. 
<H5>  Article 8 </H5>

  The present Agreement is subject to ratification, goes into 
effect on the day that certifications of ratification are 
exchanged, and operates for five years. It will automatically 
renew itself for subsequent five-year periods unless one of the 
Parties, at least 6 months before expiration of the appropriate 
period, gives notice of its desire to terminate the agreement. 
  Completed in the city of Ashgabat on 23 December 1993 in two 
copies, one in Russian and one in Turkmen, each of equal force.

Language: <F P=105> Russian </F>
Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Baturin, aide to the president for </F>
national security affairs, by Andrey Uglanov and Pavel 
Lukyanchenko, under the "Exclusively for the Readers of 
ARGUMENTY I FAKTY" rubric; in the Kremlin, date not given: "Yu. 
Baturin: `The Anonymous Author Is Being Sought'"] 
  [Text] Following a storm of rumors and reports about 
a "conspiracy" against the president, we sought comments from 
Yuriy Baturin, the aide to the president for national security 
affairs. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, information about 
the 
"coup" began to reach the editorial office as early as 6 March. 
Later on, a confidential document appeared, which was 
subsequently, a week later, published in the newspapers. What 
are the reasons for the appearance of this paper? Are you taking 
any actions? 
  [Baturin] This is perhaps the most public of all secret 
conspiracies of which I am aware. This is precisely why the 
attitude toward it is not that of one toward a conspiracy, but 
just that toward a certain political performance aimed at 
poisoning the atmosphere and creating an environment of 
suspicion. 
  Two scenarios are possible in this instance. The first 
scenario: One of those who thirst for power felt that he had 
revealed himself more than necessary. In this case, more smoke 
should be blown, as many people as possible should be named, and 
when this list has become sufficiently absurd in terms of the 
number of names and their combinations, then any other name will 
also be obscured on it--this is the smokescreen scenario. 
  Here is the second scenario. This work is a product of an 
overactive investigative imagination. When there are some signs 
of feeble encroachments on power, a person assesses them and 
arranges them in certain patterns: What could this be? Later, 
all of them fit together for the person and grow in volume. 
Subsequently, this person himself compiles such a paper and 
circulates it as extensively as possible, for example, in order 
to bring this to the attention of the people who, for some 
reason, do not see these "obvious" conspiracy patterns. 
  The letter is passed from hand to hand in Moscow; radio, TV, 
and newspapers discuss it. Figuratively speaking, the author 
sets a house on fire in order to light up its dark nooks and 
perhaps banish goblins from it. Such techniques cannot be used 
in our situation, which is quite unstable to begin with. After 
all, the house would burn down at the same time. 
  Now about the things that are being done. Everything is 
being 
done that should be done: Special services and law enforcement 
organs are looking for the anonymous author. This is precisely 
what it is called. Once he is found, it will be possible to 
raise the issue of filing criminal charges, the elements of 
crime being slander associated with the charge of committing a 
grave crime against the state. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] However, this episode coincided with the 
Internal Troops being drawn up to Moscow. 
  [Baturin] When there are troops, the Army, any other 
coercive 
structures, they live and move. There is normal life, exercises, 
redeployment, regrouping. Or would you like all of them to 
freeze, so that nobody would think that they are up to 
something? However, all of this may be perceived with suspicion, 
that is, in keeping with the models of overactive consciousness. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Why does the attending physician of the 
president not make an official presentation somewhere? 
  [Baturin] The health condition of a patient (good or bad) 
constitutes a physician's secret. If the president does not want 
bulletins about his health, even if good, released on a monthly 
basis, he is entitled to this. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] This is done in other countries. 
  [Baturin] Other countries have a different political 
culture. 
I do not want to say that ours is worse; no, it is just 
different. Nor does it appear possible to change a political 
culture for the country, say, effective Monday. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Much has been said to the effect that 
this is not even about the president, but rather about somehow 
discrediting V. Chernomyrdin. One may hear about certain 
financial and industrial groups that are envious of Gazprom. The 
concern has become quite influential, perhaps, with some 
assistance from V. Chernomyrdin. It is tempting to occupy this 
niche and to collect the same dividend. 
  [Baturin] I do not want to comment on your hypothesis in any 
way. It does not quite touch on this letter. However, if you are 
putting together versions of this kind, we must say that in this 
case, absolutely improper means are being used. We should then 
acknowledge that at issue are people who are acting improperly. 
You are perhaps aware of what this is. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Could the letter have been initiated by 
people close to the president, as an electrical shock of sorts? 
Recently, he has withdrawn from current business, in a way.... 
  [Baturin] This question fits within the second hypothesis 
which I have already outlined for you. However, I for one am not 
aware of such people in the entourage of the president. This is 
why I would like not to make such assumptions about the 
presidential entourage. As far as I know, such methods are not 
used here. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Is the September edict on the early 
election of the president on 12 June 1994 still in force? 
  [Baturin] In December, an edict of the president was issued 
which canceled quite a number of his own edicts and certain 
legislative acts before the new Constitution took effect. The 
edict that you have mentioned did not appear on the list of the 
canceled edicts. However, let us not forget about the 
transitional provisions of the Constitution in effect in keeping 
with which the president exercises his powers until the end of 
the term to which he was elected. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] To tell you the truth, we wrote a 
commentary on the topic of the "conspiracy." Here is its text: 
  We can surmise the following. In early March (according 
to some data, on the evening of 6 March), the people "at the 
top" learned about a certain discrediting action which the 
opponents of the president intended to carry out on 9 March. A 
meeting of "a narrow circle" was immediately convened, at which 
it was decided not only to avert the planned action of the 
opposition, but also to strike their own preemptive blow. 
Special services were instructed to collect by way of operations 
compromising evidence available at the time against the most 
"blameworthy" politicians, that is, those who openly crave the 
office of the president. The compromising evidence included both 
"unguarded statements" of these persons, published in the press, 
which testified to their angling for the "position," and 
information obtained from informants who were present during the 
relevant confidential conversations. All of this information was 
"chewed over" by a group of analysts, assumed the form of a 
noncommittal "Version No. 1" which will be superseded by 
subsequent versions, and disseminated among the members of the 
State Duma, journalists, and party leaders by means of a fax 
machine (belonging, as they say, to the Dinamo society). Just so 
that there would be no telltale signs and so as to cover up and 
prevent suspicions as to its genuine source of origin, one or 
two individuals loyal to the president were thrown in and in the 
second part, the Ministry of Defense "tag" was "attached" to 
"authentic" information confirmed 100 percent by materials from 
the special services. 
  Upon what did the creators of this "Version No. 1" 
count? Apparently, on killing three birds with one stone. First, 
on letting potential "conspirators" know that the eye of the 
sovereign is alert and is aware of their apparent and concealed 
intentions (for the most part, individuals appear on the list 
who remain in the shadows and do not advertise their views very 
much). Second, on creating for the people a new image of the 
"enemy" who hampers the reform course with all his might and on 
learning about the public sentiment. Third, on shaking up the 
president by showing him that not everything is good in the 
"Danish kingdom" and that it is time to become active. 
  [Baturin] This is a very far-fetched version. I can say that 
I do not know anything about such a meeting; I did not 
participate in such a meeting or give assignments. Therefore, a 
choice should be made: Either the aide for national security 
affairs does not belong to the circle that decides such things, 
or this did not happen. Thousands of people work here. Even if 
three people did talk about something, you might call it a 
meeting, and I might call it just chatter. Nonetheless, I have 
not heard about anything of the kind. 
<H6>  * * * * </H6>
  The competent organs are establishing whether the 
removal of the president was being prepared. However, changes 
have occurred in the Kremlin. At the entrance, the guard 
demanded that the operation of a dictaphone be demonstrated, 
inspected the tape, and asked whether we had weapons. Quite 
recently, it was simpler.

  [Text] A conversation with the leader of the Federal 
Service of Russia for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and 
chairman of the RG TRK [Russian State Radio and Television 
Company] Ostankino, A. Yakovlev. 
  [Starkov] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, a scandal has broken out 
around the document concerning the conspiracy against the 
president that is supposed to be in the making. What do you have 
to say about this event? 
  [Yakovlev] There is a kind of logic here. There was one 
putsch--an unsuccessful one. There was the threat of the 
president's being overthrown in the second half of last year. 
But that led to the October events. None of these attempts 
produced any results. But the people who have failed to gain the 
power are getting itchy fingers. They need a new tactic. Because 
it is no accident that the provinces did not even stir in 
response to the Moscow events, either in 1991 or last year. 
There was nothing except perturbation. And the people who want 
to interrupt the course of the reforms understand that a 
military putsch is no longer feasible. Therefore, some are 
writing a new program, others are changing their stripes, and 
still others are getting rid of the image of far left, 
arch-leftist radicals, since this is no longer a convenient 
thing to be. I see in the paper that appeared a desire to get on 
the leaders' nerves once again. To cause them to suspect one 
another. And I do not think this will be the last time. 
  [Starkov] But it is surprising that this "version" of the 
conspiracy mentions even a person so close to the president as 
V. Chernomyrdin. 
  [Yakovlev] I think that there are now people who would like 
to start a quarrel between the chairman of the Council of 
Ministers and the president. This would be very bad for the 
country. And this is also one of the versions of the so-called 
putsch--"driving in a wedge." All these are political "toys" 
with which our society is not familiar but which, alas, we have 
to get used to. But actually I think we now have a possibility 
of stabilizing the situation, especially if we get down to work. 
The government and the president and the local administration. 
Incidentally, the power is now shifting to the localities, and 
this is good. 
  It is interesting that they are resolving for themselves 
many 
issues that we once resolved in the Politburo. And they are 
doing it correctly and wonderfully! And the regions, with all 
their power and strength, have no intention of breaking apart 
and scattering. So perhaps during these two years we should 
reach an agreement and simply work. 
  [Starkov] The communists are calling for the same thing. 
  [Yakovlev] The communists have no other way out. They have 
already organized two putsches, and society could call them to 
account. 
  [Starkov] From all this it follows that you are proposing a 
difficult but at the same time temptingly clear path of peace 
and harmony. And you look with optimism on the present 
development of the situation. And yet I recall that half a year 
ago you were the one predicting an imminent cataclysm: Men, hide 
your families--and through the snowdrifts. Do we have this 
"snowdrift situation" now? 
  [Yakovlev] Not now. I guessed it the last two times. But I 
was in Austria recently, and they are saying almost in a panic: 
You gave them amnesty, this means is the onset of 
communism....but I have the feeling that something has shifted 
in the society and the clock has turned in the proper direction. 
  Yes, we have Zyuganov, Baburin, and Umalatova, but something 
has changed. We must remain vigilant, we must not allow the kind 
of dim-wittedness that is so pervasive in the democratic forces. 
But nonetheless, after these two putsches the authority of the 
people behind them has dropped sharply. Not because we democrats 
have turned out to be so intelligent (on the contrary, we have 
done everything possible to help our opponents) but because of 
objective circumstances. And the people are simply tired of all 
this; they understand that anyone who cares about the people 
will not go on the attack. 
  [Starkov] But this "peaceful" development of events has its 
own danger hidden within it: In the localities through local 
elections they can remove democratic forces from power and 
gradually return the old nomenklatura to the ministerial posts 
in the center. And this is already happening.... 
  [Yakovlev] Yes, indeed they are appointing and will appoint 
professionals as opposed to nonprofessionals. But here is the 
question: Should we be afraid of these professionals? Some of 
them--yes, but some we should not. I have had contacts with 
these people. They say: "Why do you think we are 
Red-and-brownshirts? We have been politically neutral for a long 
time. We are ready for a market economy, for a new regime of 
power, we are ready to participate in elections. But we do not 
agree with what the government is doing or the way it is doing 
it. And that is all." Why should we not assume that these 
statements are sincere? If they are, that is wonderful. We will 
always part ways when it comes to methods; otherwise there will 
be no pluralism. The main thing is not to diverge when it comes 
to objectives. In general I think that the age of the pragmatist 
has now come. And where will we find them? For now the only 
place to find them is in the nomenklatura, whether we like it or 
not. And if we find there not ideologized politicians but people 
who are devoted to their profession, let them work. 
  I think the society now needs some kind of brief respite. 
Just a breather. And for the next stage of our development, we 
must see what kind of functions our president should have. 
Ultimately, I think we will reach the conclusion that our 
president should be like an arbitration figure: He should have 
dealings with the Army and foreign affairs--and that is all. Let 
everything else be done by professionals in the parliament and 
in the Cabinet of Ministers. But they must also be responsible 
for their own affairs. 
  [Starkov] Can we really so easily turn our legacy of the 
past 
into something good? After all, there are some absolutely 
unacceptable things that we inherited from Bolshevism. 
  [Yakovlev] Yes, and one of the unpleasant features of 
Bolshevism was living not life but an imitation of life. This is 
a strange problem that has been inherited almost everywhere by 
the present bureaucracy as well. It is reflected primarily in 
the fact that we generate an endless number of appeals, 
competitions, and resolutions. Resolutions of the Politburo, 
resolutions of the Secretariat, resolutions of the government, 
the boards of the ministries, various other state organizations, 
resolutions of the bureaus of the obkoms [oblast committees], 
kraykoms [kray committees], and raykoms [rayon committees]. All 
of these resolutions are like a black cloud hovering over our 
life. Why did this happen? In general this is a fairly 
comprehensible phenomenon. When you cannot really resolve 
certain of life's problems, you must replace them with an 
imitation of life. And people lived in an unreal world of false 
hopes. 
  [Starkov] That works, incidentally. 
  [Yakovlev] And how! Otherwise, Bolshevism would not have 
lasted for 70 years. And it is still living to this day. Because 
even today among the resolutions of the most diverse levels 
again 10 percent come from real life and 90 percent are 
stillborn. The chief of the administration of one oblast showed 
me a file of resolutions he had accumulated and said: "I do not 
need this, I have a different life." He finds nothing for 
himself there. It is an ongoing imitation of life. The director 
of a hog farm near Moscow said that it was more advantageous for 
him now to slaughter all the hogs and sell them, and he would 
have 3 billion rubles, and if he were to put them in the bank 
then all the workers of this hog farm would receive twice as 
much in wages and not do anything. He asks: What kind of economy 
is this? 
  [Starkov] Let us speak about the capabilities of the 
administration. You are probably one of the most experienced 
politicians of the present day. And you have constantly been 
risking your career, your family's well-being, and even your 
life. Wherein, in your opinion, lies the art of leadership? 
  [Yakovlev] It is important always to have a sense of what 
needs to be done. But there are certain periods in history when 
it is even more important to know for certain what should not be 
done. For example, I never engaged in arguments with the 
Politburo regarding the dead, empty questions that were 
frequently raised there. The questions were very large ones and 
I should have participated in the discussion, but I remained 
silent because I sensed that they were dead. I can honestly say 
that this is a feeling. To separate the "dead" questions from 
the "living" ones takes some kind of internal mechanism that 
works in me. 
  Further. Gather the patience to listen to people. I have had 
many cases when a person will come to me and talk and talk.... I 
finally respond to him that I cannot do anything. And he says to 
me: "Yes, I know, but thank you for listening, anyway." For some 
reason in our society it has turned out that we are unable to 
listen to people as to human beings. Second. I would advise an 
upcoming bureaucrat never to promise anything. This is deception 
in which we have been engaging up to this point, that is, we 
want to replace one deception with another one. If you can do 
something, do it, and the person will be grateful. If you do it 
without promising to, the gratitude will be much greater. 
  Now, when I read in others' memoirs the kinds of complicated 
political operations and intrigues that are sometimes attributed 
to us, I sometimes start to get a swelled head. But, alas, 
nothing of the kind happened. We should not be regarded as such 
intelligent people. 
  [Starkov] You were a member of the Politburo, a person who 
was not simply in with the authorities, but one who was at the 
helm of power. Do you not get the feeling that the people 
sitting in the Kremlin today, where the Politburo used to sit, 
are still wet behind the ears and what they are doing is 
nonsense.... And this pertains not to you personally, but to the 
entire country. The plants are on the verge of shutting down, 
the coal miners are striking. One gets the feeling that this 
never happened when you were in power. 
  [Yakovlev] No, I do not have that feeling in the slightest 
degree. I am a fatalist, and I think that things are the way 
they ought to be. Nobody actually drove us out of our positions. 
We had a dacha, and a car, and a guard. We started it all 
ourselves. Many people do not understand this now. A power that 
was enlightened but still totalitarian could have been 
different. Gorbachev was quite suited for this. And one must 
give him his due; he also in some ways moved toward the breakup. 
And he turned over a great page in history. Because it would 
have been possible to hold out a little longer, well, 10 years, 
but still it would have ended with a social upheaval. 
Inevitably. Even then we were moving toward collapse. The 
stabilization that was created out of petrodollars had ended. 
And thank God the energy for the disintegration came from within 
ourselves and was not imposed on us from outside. Then there 
would have been a complete collapse, all-out war.... 
  [Starkov] Let us return to the present day. It seems to me 
that you have been fairly closemouthed in the press about your 
work in your new position as chairman of Ostankino. How did the 
appointment itself come about? You probably did not make any 
promises to Boris Nikolayevich. 
  [Yakovlev] When they were putting out feelers, I refused. 
And 
then I refused a second time. There was nothing in it for me. I 
would rather write another book....after all, I was getting into 
something that would be the shortest path to the loss of my 
reputation. But in a later conversation I told Boris 
Nikolayevich that, in the first place, nobody could interfere 
with my work, that it was to be a presidential structure. And if 
anybody wanted to give me orders I would leave. Second--I laid 
out for him the Ostankino ideology as I conceived it. The 
essence was this. We had gotten people upset. The horse had 
reared up, it was still standing on its hind legs, and was it 
not possible to get it back on all fours? To try through 
television to bring society out of this reared-back condition. 
It is necessary to see shortcomings and criticize them. Our 
television commentators are always asserting: We are on the edge 
of an abyss, there is just one step left. And I tell them: For 
three years now, we have not taken this step. Why are we marking 
time? (Laughs.) I ask the question: How many enterprises do we 
have that are in a financial position where they owe nobody 
nothing and nobody owes them anything? It has turned out that 30 
percent of them are like this. If only they had discussed just 
one of them!... 
  [Starkov] But in general and on the whole, you have still 
taken a completely new and unusual position: They say that you 
do not interfere with the preparation of programs or the work of 
the studios. This is the approach of a commander in chief who is 
developing a strategy, and not someone who wants to inspect to 
see whether a soldier has a clean collar or has tied his shoes 
correctly. 
  [Yakovlev] No, I do not want to interfere with the programs. 
This might seem to be a shortcoming, but I do not even look at 
the programs that play on one day or another. That is not my 
business. There are people who are responsible for this. I can 
not insist, say, on covering such subjects as the property 
owner, the bureaucrat, the farmer, the office worker, or small 
business. Which version, which form--that is not my business. I 
want the subjects to be heard about now, but let the 
professionals who are in charge of this find for themselves 
which programs and what to say on them. 
  [Starkov] How did you act in the extremely serious situation 
with the Ministry of Communications? After all, there was the 
threat that television was about to be shut down. 
  [Yakovlev] I said that if the government shut down 
television, another government would start it up again. I gave 
orders not to interfere. One cannot place oneself in the 
position of a supplicant. Let them try to shut us down. I follow 
the government's orders, it pays me. I did not go to the 
government meeting regarding this, and I let them know that I 
would not go there holding my hand out. 
  Now I am reproached for one thing--why was I so calm? They 
were threatening not to give us any money, to raise havoc 
throughout the press in the near future, to put out twice as 
much negative information about me. I knew why it would appear. 
I had issued orders concerning the prohibition of barter and 
centralization of advertising. 
  [Starkov] And what next? 
  [Yakovlev] Let the studios be privatized and compete, making 
their way onto the air. We will buy programs. And we will sell 
advertising if we buy the program. I think we will divide up the 
advertising like this: Of 100 percent, 40 percent will be 
centralized, 40 percent will go to the studio, and the remaining 
20 percent will be distributed by the expert artistic council 
according to ratings. 
  [Starkov] Incidentally, many of the latest ratings do not 
put 
Ostankino in first place at all but, for example, NTV. 
  [Yakovlev] I think that is normal. Anything that is new will 
have higher ratings. Let us wait half a year. 
  [Starkov] Are you not sorry that such powers as Mitkova and 
Keselev have left? After all, they could be on your team. 
  [Yakovlev] I feel ambiguous. On the one hand, I am sorry. I 
would be glad if they were with us, but since they have gone 
there, where they are paid more and where they feel better 
psychologically, I am glad for them. I have good relations with 
both Keselev and Mitkova. And you cannot demand real work from 
people when you pay them a pittance. That is degrading. 
  [Starkov] People are now saying that two state television 
companies are too many, that perhaps we should keep either one 
or the other. What will you do with GTV [state television]? 
After all, even a rich country cannot allow itself two state 
BBC's. 
  [Yakovlev] I agree, we really should have one state company, 
and for the other we should look for forms for attracting 
national capital. For example, the present Ostankino could 
become a part of a future joint-stock company. But it is not 
only a matter of finances. In the first place, Ostankino still 
means all of the former Soviet Union and the whole world. In the 
second place, I personally think that Ostankino should have its 
own image, and we should not exactly duplicate another 
television company. 
  [Starkov] You know, Aleksandr Nikolayevich, a person really 
can understand those who are surprised by your cold-bloodedness. 
Where did you get this unhurried reasonableness which has helped 
you to solve a multitude of problems and, I hope, will help with 
the problems of the television company as well? This 
philosophical calm? 
  [Yakovlev] What has helped me to have a healthier attitude 
toward things?... Well, I was not educated by Soviet power. I 
was educated by my father--even politically. I recall how they 
arrested him, how he hid, who warned him about this and how. I 
saw all this. I recall when, in 1941, there was an announcement 
from TASS about Germany, and my father, with four years of 
education, said: "That is it, son, there will be war" when 
everyone around was saying they would not attack. I remember 
when my father removed the portraits of Stalin and then 
Khrushchev. He was the first chairman of the kolkhoz--and then 
he left it, saying that people had started to work less. And 
that meant there would be trouble. A simple answer, right? If 
they started to work less there would be trouble. He alone, 
thinking in simple, common-sense categories, not suspecting that 
it was philosophy, instilled them in me. 
  [Starkov] Well, since we have touched upon the distant past, 
tell me how many years you spent in Canada? 
  [Yakovlev] Ten years. 
  [Starkov] Did you have an interpreter? 
  [Yakovlev] The first year, for insurance. So that there 
would 
be a person who could confirm that I did not say something. The 
remaining nine years I got by without an interpreter. 
  [Starkov] How many years did you study at Columbia 
University? 
  [Yakovlev] A year in graduate school. 
  [Starkov] Along with Kalugin? 
  [Yakovlev] Yes. 
  [Starkov] When you went there, did you understand that you 
would "tarnish" your biography, that that would be some kind of 
blemish on your resume? 
  [Yakovlev] Yes, I understood that, and Kryuchkov took 
advantage of this blemish. Although of my 17 acquaintances who 
went there with me, 14 were not from science or, rather, they 
were from a science of a different profile. 
  When the procuracy filed a criminal case against me, all the 
documents were brought up. But they found nothing except two 
denunciations. Oleg Kalugin granted an interview regarding my 
case, and he was officially interrogated. They also interrogated 
Gorbachev, Bakatin, and Chebrikov. 
  [Starkov] Who made the denunciations? 
  [Yakovlev] Resident agents. And these denunciations were 
simply because of my statements: I had criticized the work of 
the KGB. 
  [Starkov] And what were you doing at Columbia University? 
  [Yakovlev] I was writing a dissertation on historiography of 
American foreign policy. 
  [Starkov] What kind of incomes do you live on? You 
personally. 
  [Yakovlev] I finally received wages from Ostankino of about 
300,000 rubles. And I have a pension of 112,000 as a disabled 
war veteran. 
  [Starkov] And as a member of the Politburo. 
  [Yakovlev] When I approached pension age I submitted all the 
documents to the rayon social security division; let them figure 
it out according to the law. At that time they assigned me 400 
rubles. Two pensions--civilian and military. I have been 
receiving the military pension since I was 20. When Politburo 
members went on pension they received 500 rubles. Boldin was 
disturbed and reported to Gorbachev. How could it be--I went to 
social security! 
  [Starkov] Do your books bring you any income? 
  [Yakovlev] I have calculated (the publishing house gave me 
complete accounts of state revenues from the books) that if they 
had given me all that money, it would have been more than my 
wages--both in the Politburo and before then.

<F P=106> [Letter to ARGUMENTY I FAKTY: "Soft Landing, Mr. President!" </F>
This letter is in response to an article by Aleksandr Sargin 
under the rubric "Scandal": "A Soft Landing to You, Mr. 
President!" which was translated and published under the 
headline: "Problems in Presidential Flight Team Noted" in 
FBIS-USR-94-008, 2 February 1994, pp 2-3] 
  [Text] We are amazed and upset by your article "Soft 
Landing, Mr. President!" since the majority of us like your 
newspaper and value the objectivity, diversity, and topicality 
of the material, the boldness of its opinions, and the high 
professionalism of its presentation. This article, however, was 
in sharp contrast to all that we have read hitherto. 
  Who gave the author (who is known to none of the members of 
the outfit and who, naturally, cannot know its assignments and 
endeavors) the right to judge our company, its activity, and its 
leader--a professional pilot of the highest class, with 
"God-given talent," as the people say. Can there be any 
justification for such improper behavior (aimed, in our view, at 
causing a sensation, most likely, some department functionary 
clinging to a wholly needless chair which is slipping away), 
traumatizing the outfit and taking up its time, which is so much 
needed in the business of renewal. 
  We do not intend to justify ourselves on the substance of 
this malevolence, and the article as a whole could not be called 
anything else! We demand a meeting with the author. Nor would it 
have done the newspaper any harm, before publication of this 
article, to meet with specialists of the company, with the 
leadership, and with the public. Nor is it too late even now! We 
maintain that the material set forth in the article is pure 
invention. Truly, some of the events did occur, but everything 
here has, as they say, been "stood on its head!" The characters, 
the dates, the place, and the time of the events and so forth 
were changed. Serious allegations were leveled at the company on 
the basis of absolutely incompetent arguments. The information 
adduced on the landing of the Il-62 in a "Vnukovo field" evokes 
mirth, and not only in the professional. There was not even the 
remotest approximation of anything of the kind, what is more. 
This was manifest slander of the company and management! Why 
also in your article is there such a lack of respect for the 
president? For a state organization and the state as a whole? 
The trashy material and cynicism, which are atypical of your 
publication, are jarring! 
  Whence this fury leveled at, it is our firm belief, a useful 
undertaking? We assure you that the entire work of the Rossiya 
State Transport Company is built on an understanding of the 
country's present economic condition and is geared to the 
speediest complete renunciation of state budget appropriations. 
  When, though, permit us to ask, has an outfit been blamed 
for 
the assimilation of new equipment? Is this not geared to the 
development of state potential as a whole and a growth of 
well-being, skills, and image of the outfit? 
  Of course, our outfit, like any other, is not insured 
against 
mistakes, but you cannot destroy an idea without an 
understanding of its essence. 
  Can we all be considered absolute bunglers rejecting Air 
Transport Department control and safety documentation and also 
ICAO [International Civil Aviation Organization] documents 
written in the blood of all air catastrophes? Who rejected 
professional cooperation with the department? A. Larin? Someone 
else from the company? Absurd! It was he, after all, who created 
the department! Where's the logic? 
  We are for professional contact, but without bureaucratic 
red 
tape! 
  We request and demand an immediate investigation in point of 
substance, a retraction in the paper, restitution to the company 
for moral damage, and our protection henceforward from such 
nonsense! 
  [Signed] Staff of the Rossiya State Transport Company 
  FROM THE EDITORS: A series of air 
catastrophes has as of late cost the lives of hundreds of 
people. This is, probably, one of the most dreadful ways to die. 
Shots of pieces of charred human flesh amid the piles of 
wreckage of an aircraft are horrifying. "Filled" daily almost 
with such information, could we have remained silent, having 
received alarming warnings about the president's flights? 
  Of course, cold calculation suggests that all documents 
should be collected as a preliminary. But experience tells us 
that this is practically impossible--for very many reasons. 
Following, therefore, a taped conversation with four deputy 
leaders of the aviation detachment (three no longer work there), 
we decided to publish the material. They all subsequently failed 
to show the editors the necessary documents, it is true. 
  It would now seem perfectly probable that the ARGUMENTY 
I FAKTY correspondent was an unwitting instrument of internal 
intrigues in the aviation detachment--attempts were being made 
to settle scores through him. But even if this version is 
correct, it is only partially so. Following the publication, 
certain aviation specialists met with the author of the article 
and provided additional information, as they say. But the 
problem is that they also were unwilling to make documents 
available or at least put their name to what they had to say. 
  It remains for us to confess that the paper was in a 
rush to publish the article, which cast aspersions on the outfit 
of the aviation detachment. We apologize to it and very much 
hope that we will not in the near future find ourselves proved 
right, for all that, albeit at a very high price.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA </F>
observer Aleksandr Borin; place and date not given: "The 
Terrible Temptation of Centrism"] 
  [Text] [Borin] Yegor Timurovich, the press today is 
actively discussing the unexpected actions of Sergey Shakhray, 
who voted in the Duma for political amnesty. The most diverse 
theories are being advanced. Some people are even assuming that 
there is some kind of secret conspiracy with the president, who 
would prefer that the investigation not dot all the i's. Others, 
conversely, see a behind-the-scenes agreement with the Duma 
leaders. It is no accident, they say, that one of Shakhray's 
men, Andrey Voykov, was placed at the head of its 
administration. What are your ideas? 
  [Gaydar] Of course there is always the temptation to see the 
authorities as crafty, perfidious, and far-sighted, but most 
frequently this is not the way things really are. I do not 
believe in complicated political schemes in general and I 
certainly do not expect them from the present executive 
authority. Politics, as a rule, is arranged more simply and 
rigidly. Refined schemes involving multiple moves are usually 
undermined by the rough current of life right in the first 
stages. Therefore I absolutely do not believe in schemes 
involving intricate intrigues on the part of the president. 
Shakhray's position was a bit of a surprise to me too; to be 
honest, I did not anticipate such a turn. All I can say is that 
I completely reject the story that there was a 
misunderstanding--"ah, we were not aware, ah, we did not know." 
These people are intelligent enough to know and to be aware. 
What is wrong? The hypothesis I came up with is this: The 
terrible temptation of centrism gained a hold. Centrism as a 
means of access to power. In politics, in my view, there exist 
two completely different strategies. The first: You have your 
own convictions and ideas about what the country needs. You 
defend them, you fight for them. If you cannot defend them while 
in power, you work with the opposition. That can take years, 
perhaps decades. This political strategy proceeds from the idea 
to the world view. The second strategy: Politics as the art of 
staying in power. It presupposes the ability to react very 
flexibly to the changing political waves, to skip from one to 
another, to significantly change your outlook and points of 
reference. Here it is absolutely necessary to prove that you are 
the greatest centrist, that you are prepared to cooperate with 
everyone. And if you have come from one particular side, in 
order to prove that you are a centrist, naturally, you have to 
make friends with representatives of the opposing side. You have 
to hold out your hand to them, demonstrate your loyalty. 
Speaking in extremely simple terms, I think it is here that we 
find the basis of the political drift of Sergey Shakhray and 
many other former democrats. 
  [Borin] But someone will say to you: "I have not betrayed 
anybody, I simply changed my basic principles, my attitude 
toward the matter." 
  [Gaydar] Oh, it is difficult to pretend here. It is 
immediately apparent for whom the cause is the most important 
thing and for whom it is terrible painful to lose all the 
trappings of power. Because power is terribly attractive. It 
makes a person unusually vulnerable. The prospect of suddenly 
becoming simply an ordinary private individual again is terribly 
frightening. I have seen this in people who, it seemed to me, 
were absolutely not susceptible to it. 
  [Borin] When you retired, did you experience something like 
this? 
  [Gaydar] No, I did not experience anything of the kind, not 
at all. Although I understand that feeling quite well. That is, 
I can see the tiny fragments from which such a feeling is 
formed. People's attitude toward you changes. Endless problems 
arise. You see boorishness. And many, many things like that. 
Previously a person was great and everyone loved him, everyone 
told him how intelligent he was, how valuable his opinion was, 
how everyone wanted to make friends with him... And suddenly it 
turns out that none of that was true, that now he is some kind 
of weird half-wit. And in general what has he done? Moved from 
one mistake to another? And why is he still in this position? 
You must also figure out... 
  [Borin] People are rude to him, they remind him of the 
laboratory chiefs who, they say, shook the entire country. 
  [Gaydar] I regret very much that Viktor Stepanovich 
Chernomyrdin did not share his ideas about the laboratory chiefs 
and prime ministers while he was working under me. As I recall, 
he was very polite, unusually polite, I would say, to the point 
of being sickening. Perhaps he simply did not know that one of 
the principles adopted in cultured society is that the level of 
politeness does not depend on whether a person is your superior 
or not... So many of those who are in power today understand 
what awaits them when they leave power. And some people are 
terribly frightened by this. And then they are prepared to chain 
themselves to their little chairs, thinking up all kinds of 
reasons why they cannot leave. Policy has changed, everything 
has changed, but they still have to be there. 
  [Borin] Are you talking about the upper echelons of power? 
  [Gaydar] Not necessarily at all. It is by no means only the 
pompous forms of power that are attractive. The very connection 
to power is already an immense temptation. Many of the most 
diverse people ask to be included on one commission or another. 
The very admission to the corridors of power, the possibility of 
coming and participating in the process of decisionmaking, which 
might very well turn out to be quite different from what you 
would like--this is still a temptation. You were there, perhaps 
you even said something that did not exactly fit in with what 
the boss was saying, and the boss nodded, gave it some thought, 
and did it his own way--but still there is the temptation. You 
are fully aware that you are playing the role of a democratic 
shield for the nomenklatura, but you are incapable of refusing. 
I know excellent people who have not been able to refrain from 
this. And if the boss wants to surround himself with such a 
clique of former democrats, he will have absolutely no 
difficulty finding the people he needs. Perhaps not the top 
ones, not the most courageous, not the most intelligent, but 
simply with some democratic past. 
  [Borin] While the democrats are squabbling amongst 
themselves 
and betraying one another, the real power remains in the hands 
of the apparatchiks, the bureaucrats. 
  [Gaydar] Of course! There are such incredible masters here! 
I 
will give you one example. In September I accepted an invitation 
to work in the government again. Literally a couple of days 
later--current questions were being discussed at a 
meeting--suddenly, quite unexpectedly, out of the blue, a note 
from Finance Minister Fedorov concerning reorganization of the 
government was brought up. The note was old, from July or 
August, before I was working there. The essence of the note was 
that the Ministry of Economics had to be abolished and all these 
functions, for which I was responsible, would be concentrated in 
the Ministry of Finance. After that it was assumed that I would 
immediately jump down Fedorov's throat and start a terrible 
fight with him and he would then beat me off and run to complain 
to the higher authorities. I got together with Boris and we had 
a few laughs. But situations like this are coming up constantly, 
they are created brilliantly. And what sweet temptations the 
apparatus throws out to you! Let us do all of this. And why do 
you not do this little bit, which would be very good for the 
family. How nice and splendid it will be, and everyone will be 
so satisfied! To be honest, my colleagues laughed at me when I 
made them write down in the gift book the presentation of some 
kind of badge, etc. But it is my deep conviction that such 
purism is actually useful. It simply teaches the apparatus that 
such little things do not go so cheaply. 
  [Borin] Have there been attempts to approach you like that? 
  [Gaydar] Yes, of course there have. It is inevitable. 
  [Borin] So, are these kinds of intrigues inevitable? Are 
there no methods of fighting against them? 
  [Gaydar] Well, what can I say. This is a subject that is 
very 
difficult to discuss, to describe. If you start to bring an 
intriguer out into the open, to prove how he is twisting things 
and lying--then the intrigue has already achieved its purpose. 
You are damned if you do and damned if you don't... These, 
unfortunately, are methods it is very difficult to combat in 
direct and open polemic. 
  [Borin] You know, in our circle we always used to be afraid 
of what they called losing face. We were sentimental in the good 
sense of the word, if you will. The well-known words "Let us 
hold hands, friends, so we do not fall alone" expressed our main 
feelings, our aspirations. But now, it seems to me, the author 
himself would no longer write them, sensing that they, alas, are 
as if from another time. 
  [Gaydar] Yes, we have lost our sentimentality. I think this 
is very bad. How did it happen? A very complicated question. I 
would say this. There used to be a fairly simple arrangement: us 
and them. They were the authorities. They were cruel and evil. 
We were not the authorities. We could be destroyed and oppressed 
by them, we were dependent on them. But we were intelligent, 
honest, and good. We had our morality, we had our norms of 
behavior. We could hold each other's hands. This is not out of 
1937. It is the way things were at the end of the fifties and 
beginning of the sixties. This is not the way it was with mass 
terror, this is the way it was with a gentle authoritarian 
regime which, by and large, did not bother anyone who did not 
deliberately pick a fight with it. It allowed people to speak 
their minds in their own homes, it allowed them to be 
themselves, to be intelligent and worthy, as long as they did 
not sneak up to it with leaflets and dynamite. It seems to me 
that this is the basis of the intelligentsia culture from which 
Okudzhava and many other excellent writers sprang. Incidentally, 
in a certain sense these are the revived traditions of the 
Russian intelligentsia, Russian society. That is the way it was 
in the 19th century as well. Then too there was a gentle 
authoritarian regime, there were also "us" and "them," and we 
also had our own morality. In general it seems to me that gentle 
authoritarianism which precludes direct contact with the 
authorities is a fairly healthy environment for this kind of 
intelligentsia culture and morality. 
  [Borin] And now? Is this the result of rubbing elbows with 
the authorities? 
  [Gaydar] Things are much more complicated now. It is no 
longer "us" and "them." Now the authorities are divided and 
society is divided. There are many very different kinds of "us" 
and many very different kinds of "them." I would never have 
thought that people whom I knew well would suddenly end up in 
the enemy camp, as our political opponents. Evil opponents. But 
that is the way it has turned out. I went to the president and 
vouched for some of my friends. He said to me: "This one did 
this and that." I answered: "I do not believe it, that cannot 
be." 
  [Borin] And how did it turn out? 
  [Gaydar] In various ways. Sometimes it was discovered that 
it 
was slander, an attempt to discredit somebody. But 
sometimes--yes, alas, it was true. 
  [Borin] In the press today there are a lot of arguments 
about 
the position of the former procurator general Aleksey Kazannik. 
They say that since he thought that political amnesty was 
disgraceful he could refuse to implement this decree and then 
retire. One thing is clear: A noble person ended up as a 
plaything in the hands of the others in the procuracy. I am not 
saying anything about the helplessness and inconsistency of the 
presidential administration. 
  [Gaydar] I am not Aleksey Ivanovich's judge. By and large I 
agree with him. The fight against the extremely dangerous Duma 
decree could have and should have been waged long before it was 
adopted. Well, what about Aleksey Ivanovich? In a certain sense 
he is that kind of person. In my view, he is a man of high moral 
qualities. To be honest, I expected nothing less of him. 
  [Borin] The period when you were in the government today is 
called the "romantic," "heroic" period of our reforms. How is 
this to be understood? When conducting the reforms, did you try 
to stay within the confines of some moral rules? Not to lie, not 
to promise what you could not deliver? 
  [Gaydar] I think you are right. Moreover, lying is an 
economic category of the highest degree. Ruslan Imranovich tried 
to prove to me that panic was not an economic category. He was 
wrong, panic is absolutely an economic category. It exerts an 
immense influence on the development of the entire complex of 
financial processes. Stock exchange panic, foreign currency 
panic, etc. So lying is also a completely economic category. 
Something is always being demanded of the state, of the 
politician. First: Either do not promise anything, or promise 
something and try to do it. This, of course, is very dangerous 
if certain dangerous and difficult things are promised. The 
other extremely widespread policy is when you promise things but 
you do not do them. In economics this is called discrepancy 
between the budget based on commitments that have been made and 
the budget based on financial flows. That is, you have promised 
everything to everyone. And then: "Well, you see, there is none. 
I will give you none, and you none, and I will not give you any 
either." This is the underlying foundation for the extremely 
severe financial crisis we are experiencing right now. It is 
related to the attempt to implement precisely that policy since 
the spring of 1993. Then, in the autumn, we tried to fight, to 
do something. But not to the end. We did not manage to, we were 
unable to. Such a policy is very risky. Because it discredits 
the state. Extreme financial problems are created for all who 
believed in the state. Millions of people suffer, ties are 
disturbed among enterprises, suppliers of raw material, 
suppliers of semimanufactured products, and suppliers of 
electric energy. The immense economic chain is broken. And it is 
all because it was convenient for me to say: "I will do this, I 
will give it to you." And then go into another room and say: "Of 
course, I will not give them a thing." That is a very vulnerable 
economic policy. And if it is an economic policy of realism, I 
assure you it has never led anyone to anything good and it never 
will. 
  [Borin] For decades we have lived under the power of 
favorites whose principle has been: After us, the flood. Does 
this mean that they are raising their heads again. 
  [Gaydar] Well, generally speaking, of course.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Vladislav Alekseyevich </F>
Achalov by Sergey Turchenko; place and date not given: "Two 
Hours Before the Assault"] 
  [Text] SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA published a short interview 
with Lieutenant General Vladislav Alekseyevich Achalov 
immediately after he left Lefortovo. Today, we offer the reader 
a more detailed interview with the minister of defense of a 
House of Soviets that was riddled with gunfire. 
  [Turchenko] Vladislav Alekseyevich, let us begin from the 
moment that you were appointed minister of defense. Many of our 
readers ask in their letters: Why did you not take any kind of 
steps for real execution of the duties that were entrusted to 
you by the Congress of People's Deputies? 
  [Achalov] When the Congress of People's Deputies appointed 
me, Barannikov, and Dunayev force ministers, individual people, 
even from among the people's deputies demanded: Go to the 
ministries, take up your positions, and start to manage. But the 
real situation and common sense suggested another path for 
resolving the question. Since the three force ministries were 
appointed, this meant that a government should be formed as 
well. Without this, for us to go to the ministries and there 
establish parallel managerial structures would mean the direct 
involvement of the Army, the MB [Ministry of Security], and the 
MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] in opposition inside these 
very structures themselves, which would lead to a full-scale 
civil war. I told both Khasbulatov and Rutskoy: If a new 
government is to be formed, and this is their prerogative, then 
questions of the Ministry of Defense can be resolved within its 
framework. But this, as is well-known, was not done. 
  [Turchenko] Some analysts think that it was a tactical error 
to appoint new force ministers outside the framework of a 
government, for this would seem to doom Grachev, Yerin, and 
Golushko to opposition with respect to the congress. 
  [Achalov] Grachev, Yerin, and Golushko were invited to a 
meeting of the congress as full-fledged ministers, but they did 
not appear. And this was their deliberate choice: To take the 
side of the president immediately. They undeviatingly took the 
path of unconstitutionality. When this became obvious, the 
congress appointed new force ministers. For me personally this 
was a surprise, but nothing remained to be done except to 
fulfill the will of congress. 
  [Turchenko] What does to fulfill mean? What could the 
minister of defense do sitting inside the blockaded House of 
Soviets? 
  [Achalov] We knew, and now it is obvious to many, that in 
September the MVD planned and prepared an operation to eliminate 
the Congress of People's Deputies. Besides the forces and 
resources of Moscow Oblast, OMON [Special Missions Militia 
Detachments] Personnel and Internal Affairs subunits from many 
regions were drawn up at the House of Soviets. In addition, in 
September, all of the army units closest to Moscow were 
dispatched to harvest potatoes, and all of the militia subunits 
were pulled out of the potato fields. The fact is that people 
from Yeltsin's circle knew what kind of an attitude the army 
showed to the regime in the referendum, and they did not count 
on it. They put into operation specifically cultivated OMON and 
Spetsnaz [Special Purpose Forces] forces. In this connection, I 
had the task of organizing antiprovocation measures and the 
security of the House of Soviets. That is, all of my work was 
directed at ensuring the safety of the deputies and more or less 
the peaceful work of the congress. Such tasks as going to the 
troops, inspiring them, and leading them in a breakthrough were 
not assigned. 
  The biggest misfortune was that neither Yeltsin, nor his 
circle, wanted to accept a compromise and to resolve the dispute 
at the top. They brought the situation to a point where the 
people themselves undertook the task. And when they saw that on 
3 October the people came to the defense of the House of Soviets 
and the legal authority, they incited bloodshed. 
  [Turchenko] Let us look at 4 October through the eyes of a 
military professional. What was the sense of the tank shelling 
of the House of Soviets? 
  [Achalov] On the evening of 3 October, authority was 
paralyzed. The most resolute figures from Yeltsin's circle 
understood that only a harsh bloody battle would be capable of 
bringing their supporters out of shock. These tank firings were 
necessary to them at any price and for any money. The Army, MVD, 
and the MB ended up drawn into a monstrous bloody game. No 
matter how much the finger is pointed at us now, declaring us to 
be the culprits of this tragedy, it is apparent to any sensible 
person: Being completely isolated, behind barbed wire, without 
communications means, theoretically we could not even create any 
kind of a dangerous situation. There was no military necessity 
to fire into the parliament building. This was a purely 
political act with the unjustified employment of heavy weapons. 
  [Turchenko] What do you remember particularly from this 
nightmare? 
  [Achalov] For two hours before the assault, our people in 
the 
MO [Ministry of Defense], MVD, and MB reported that an 
irreversible decision for its execution was already made. 
Military people came to me and tried to persuade me for a long 
time so that I would leave with them. I answered firmly that I 
would remain with the deputies to the end. I recall, as a 
minimum, two moments when Khasbulatov tried to get to Yeltsin in 
order to avoid bloodshed, but the president's circle did not 
permit such negotiations. And a savage reprisal started. I had 
occasion to participate in different conflicts in the border 
areas of our country. But there was nothing comparable to this 
barbarous brutality. After all, it was not without reason that 
workers of the Procuracy afterwards were not permitted in the 
House of Soviets for three days. All this time, the MVD and the 
OMON were clearing the building of blood and corpses. 
  When the shelling reached the fiercest stage, Khasbulatov 
and 
Rutskoy telephoned Zorkin, and they tried to reach Chernomyrdin 
so that they could promote a ceasefire. In the end--it was 
already the evening of 4 October--some Alpha officer arrived and 
said that he was authorized to take me, Barannikov, and Dunayev 
to negotiations with representatives of Chernomyrdin. We came 
out of the 20th entry way and got into an armored personnel 
carrier that took us to Krasnaya Presnya. Buses were parked 
there. Near one of them I spotted Barsukov, whose eyes were 
restless. I understood immediately that we had been tricked. 
When the bus started to move and I saw what route it was taking, 
no doubts were left: We were being taken to Lefortovo, and not 
to negotiations. 
  The first interrogation was held at 2300 hours on 4 October. 
I declared immediately that I was detained through deceit and, 
in addition, that my diplomatic immunity was violated. But no 
one paid any attention to this, as happens in our country. At 
first an attempt was made to steer me into the Terekhov affair. 
It did not work. Then they brought the standard accusation of 
massive disorders. But nothing here also could be linked to the 
law. If it were not for the amnesty, I do not know how the 
Procuracy would have extricated itself from the situation into 
which it had cornered itself. 
  [Turchenko] A judicial process could have shed light on the 
truth about September-October 1993. Perhaps you should have 
refused amnesty and attempted to go to court? 
  [Achalov] I do not believe in an objective court trial in 
the 
present state where the highest law--the constitution--is 
crushed with tank tracks. 
  [Turchenko] Do you consider yourself vanquished? 
  [Achalov] No. But I also do not see any victors. The present 
authority conducted a provocation against itself as well. As a 
matter of fact, it signed its own sentence. The elections showed 
that the people turned away from it and that it will not accept 
such authority. 
  [Turchenko] Now everything is being done in a clumsy way by 
the president's team, and an economic catastrophe is imminent in 
the country. Did you not give some thought to the fact that 
perhaps you were released from the dungeons in order that there 
would be live material for drawing a picture of an internal 
enemy? 
  [Achalov] Really, parliament cannot be shot up a second 
time. 
But the authorities are in urgent need of an internal enemy in 
order to divert the attention of the people from hunger and cold 
and from the true culprits of the impending catastrophe. And so 
the "democratic" mass media has pounced on us. They are a priori 
shouting about some kind of extremist plans. I do not doubt that 
there will be attempts to involve some of the released prisoners 
in a new escapade. Objectively, a period of spontaneous protest 
demonstrations are drawing near. Undoubtedly, they will always 
be linked to us, even if we do not begin to participate in them. 
After all, this is so easy: Put signs with our portraits in 
the hands of "plants" and then have them shout: They will say, 
the October prisoners are stirring up the people, and they are 
trying to take power. Is this not a pretext for the introduction 
of a dictatorship, without which the present authorities are not 
capable of lasting? 
  [Turchenko] Does this mean that you are distancing yourself 
from any kind of a spontaneous or organized struggle whatsoever 
of the people against the current tyranny? 
  [Achalov] I am against forceful variants of this struggle, 
because this will be a catastrophe. A civil war is already going 
on in outlying areas. Different groups are fighting for spheres 
of influence and sales markets. It will already be impossible to 
extinguish the next skirmish in the center. And in no case is it 
possible to allow it to happen. 
  [Turchenko] The present authority is moving toward an 
economic catastrophe. An attempt to replace it is fraught with 
military catastrophe. How is it possible to avoid these two 
catastrophes? 
  [Achalov] The solution is the common sense of the people. I 
read a lot in Lefortovo and I became convinced: The Russian 
people always found the medicine against leaders who were 
unacceptable to it. Undoubtedly, it will find it now as well. 
Time will put everything in its place. 
  [Turchenko] What are your near-term forecasts? 
  [Achalov] Far from optimistic. If assistance is not provided 
immediately to agriculture, an inevitable famine awaits us. No 
one will start to feed us for nothing. We have already eaten up 
all of NATO's spoiled products. We have to give our peasant an 
opportunity to sow... 
  [Turchenko] And what are your personal near-term plans? 
  [Achalov] After coming out of Lefortovo, it is necessary to 
look into my own situation to the end; after all, my status is 
still unknown, and then I have to find my place in contemporary 
life. There already are proposals for work. Not only in our 
country, but abroad as well. But I do not plan to depart for 
anywhere. I have one thought--to be of use to the people. I have 
not decided yet in what capacity.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Shakhray, minister for nationalities and </F>
regional policy: "Three Big Shots for the New Russia: They Are 
Federalism, a Socially Oriented Market Economy, and Local 
Government"] 
  [Text] The considerations and propositions adduced below 
represent not only my personal viewpoint as a scholar who has 
been studying problems of federalism for more than 16 years now. 
They reflect to a certain extent the plans and intentions of the 
ministry that I head. 
  First and most important: The federalization of Russia does 
not mean a weakening of the state but the sole possible way of 
preserving its unity and integrity. But lest the objective 
processes of decentralization bring about the disintegration of 
the state, they must be cast in civilized forms of federalism. 
Federalism for Russia also means an opportunity to unite the 
rich potential of all Russia's regions and the sole possible 
form of the democratic organization of society. 
  Underlying the most essential contradiction of the state 
arrangement of Russia is the approach whereby federalism was for 
more than 70 years seen solely as a method of solution of the 
nationality question. This was both the ideology and the 
practice of constitutional development. Of course, it was not 
realized in all things but it was this approach that guided our 
former constitutional developers, and it was to these criteria 
that the internal arrangement of the USSR and the RSFSR 
corresponded. 
  Another form of state arrangement of the Russian Federation, 
in which the economic and territorial aspects have emerged in 
the "federalism" category, has arisen and has been developing in 
the past four years. Federalism has "suddenly" become the mode 
of distribution of economic and power authority within the 
Russian Federation and also a factor actively influencing the 
pace and forms of economic and political reform. Thus the 
national model of arrangement of the state and the territorial 
model of the arrangement of the state have found themselves in 
contradiction. 
  There is just one way out of this contradiction: We are 
condemned to a long transitional period, in the course of which 
we will have to find the optimum forms of the interaction of 
national aspects of state arrangement and the purely economic 
and territorial forms. 
  It is the ostensibly incomprehensible argument between the 
republics and oblasts about the equality of the components of 
the Russian Federation that is behind this contradiction of the 
two forms of state arrangement of Russia--national and 
territorial--which exist simultaneously. The need for 
recognition of a transitional period means that the republics, 
as national states, will be preserved within the Russian 
Federation. The krays and oblasts of the Russian Federation will 
enjoy development also (the constitution has equalized in a 
legal respect all components of the Russian Federation). We must 
pay particular attention, however, to the formulation and 
support of new fledgling forms of integration of the components 
within the Federation itself. 
  The first experience in this respect is to hand--it is the 
activity of the interregional economic associations. There are 
eight of them today, and they encompass, as a whole, the entire 
territory of the Russian Federation. Within the framework of 
such associations different components of the Russian Federation 
interact with one another and tackle specific economic, 
transport, and other economic problems, regardless of their 
status. 
  I proceed from the fact that equality does not mean 
identity, 
and no one, therefore, will succeed in "accommodating" the 
entire diversity of the components of the Russian Federation to 
some one format. If only because some regions are subsidized and 
exist thanks to subventions of the federal budget. And this is 
not their fault but a consequence of the location of the 
productive forces and the development of the economy throughout 
previous years. Other regions are profitable, and not only the 
federal budget but also the subsidized regions live thanks to 
them. This means that there may be and will be different 
approaches in economic strategy and tactics in respect to 
different components of the Russian Federation. The new 
Constitution of Russia has laid down important principles of the 
self-regulation and "self-adjustment" of the Federation. While 
having preserved and strengthened the constitutional nature of 
Russia, the constitution has at the same time recorded the 
possibility of the regulation of processes of the delineation of 
authority by the Federal and other treaties. 
  Part 3 of Article 11 of the constitution, which is devoted 
to 
these matters, is enshrined in the chapter "Fundamentals of the 
Constitutional System" and thus takes precedence over other 
provisions of the constitution. Article 78 enshrines the 
possibility of the delegation of authority by the federal 
structures of power to the level of the components and vice 
versa. Articles 73 and 76 enshrine the fullness of power of 
components of the Federation in respect to all matters other 
than those pertaining to the competence of the Federation and 
also the right to independently regulate matters referred to the 
competence of the components. In aggregate, the said provisions 
represent a basis for use of the mechanisms of "self-adjustment" 
within the Russian Federation. It is on these articles that the 
treaty that has just been signed with Tatarstan is based. 
  Debate of the status of the Republic of Tatarstan is not a 
subject of the treaty. This is simply not in the treaty. Article 
1 of the treaty talks about the format of the delineation of 
terms of reference and authority, and then come articles on the 
authority of the organs of state power. The treaty is called 
"Delineation of the Terms of Reference and Mutual Delegation of 
Authority Between Organs of State Power of the Russian 
Federation and Organs of State Power of the Republic of 
Tatarstan." This treaty was born over the course of three years, 
and it contains certain conceptually new provisions which could 
and, in my view, should be the subject of scientific analysis. 
  First, this treaty was born not of a political debate 
between 
the parties to the treaty but by way of the successive 
conclusion of specific agreements. Eleven such agreements were 
signed. They regulate individual economic matters, problems of 
the delineation of state property, budget and tax relations, and 
so forth. Thus the formulas of the main treaty were born of 
specific agreements. And following the signing of such a treaty, 
the Federation obtains a ready mechanism of its realization in 
the form of these agreements. This is undoubtedly a new 
approach, which could be applied in many other instances also. 
  And the second, fundamentally important, fact. The 
Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, like the 
constitutions of many other republics also, is today in formal 
contradiction with the text of the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation. According to the Constitution of Russia, no federal 
body can abolish, fully or some part thereof, the constitution 
of any republic. It might be expected that the republic 
authorities would revise their constitution independently, but 
this could prove to be an interminable process. The treaty on 
the delineation of terms of reference and authority now 
represents the sole possibility, therefore, of the removal of 
the formal contradictions between the constitutions of the 
republics and the federal constitution. Inasmuch as a provision 
of the treaty in this case takes precedence over the rules of 
law, the format of the delineation of terms of reference and 
authority corresponding to the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation will take effect. 
  I have dwelt on this in such detail for the added reason 
that 
this treaty has "closed" a long three-year period, when neither 
the federal constitution nor federal laws in fact operated on 
the territory of Tatarstan. None of the efforts of both the 
former parliament or the positive efforts of the Constitutional 
Court had any real effect in resolving these collisions. 
  A few words about the political aspects of federalism. They 
lie in the plane of an improvement in state power in the Russian 
Federation on the basis of the principles of federalism. It is a 
question of realization of Article 77 of the Constitution of the 
Russian Federation and the draft federal law on the common 
principles of organization of representative and executive power 
in the components of the Russian Federation. Guarantees of the 
fundamentals of the constitutional system and the equality of 
the citizens and, primarily, guarantees of their suffrage, the 
model of delineation of powers between the executive and 
representative authorities, the principle of the electivity of 
the heads of administration and the local government 
authorities, and certain principles of the delineation of terms 
of reference and authority could and should be the subject of 
such a law. This would be a considerable step forward in the 
development of the political aspects of federalism in Russia. 
  The economic aspects of federalism are the next important 
issue. We can talk for as long as you like about the fact that 
Russia must be a full-fledged federation, but as long as the tax 
and budget systems remain exclusively unitary, Russia will never 
be a federation. The main thing, therefore, is to bring the 
budget and tax systems into line with the federative nature of 
the state. Each component of the Federation must have its own 
sources of revenue in the form of tax receipts into its own 
coffers. In addition, the federal fund for support of the 
regions must finally begin to function. And the logic of tax 
collection must necessarily be revised. 
  I do not believe that income tax should remain mainly in the 
hands of a component of the Russian Federation or a local 
government authority but should be a federal tax. Each citizen 
should personally and directly do his bit for the cause of the 
Federation. Taxes of the VAT type, profits tax, and others, on 
the other hand, should be a subject of distribution. A specific 
format is being worked up by our ministry. We calculate that it 
will be possible to switch to an essentially federal tax and 
budget format as of 1995. 
  Unfortunately, a mass of violations is being perpetrated at 
this time on the part of the organs of state power of the 
components of the Federation in the economic sphere: nonpayment 
of federal taxes, the imposition of internal customs, 
restrictions on the free movement of goods and services, and 
other obstacles. This is prohibited by the constitution, and the 
federal authorities should not only respond appropriately to 
such violations but also formulate a new format ensuring the 
unity of the economic space of Russia, the unrestricted movement 
of goods, services, and people, and the equal legal protection 
of citizens of the Russian Federation, wherever they may be on 
the territory of Russia. The basis for the economic unity of the 
Russian Federation should be such elements of a common 
infrastructure as power engineering, transport, communications, 
and information science. For the equalization of the regions, 
which differ considerably in terms of level of economic 
development, it will evidently be necessary to introduce 
territorial rent also. There are no other effective sources of 
the redistribution of budget and financial resources. 
  And, finally, national aspects of federalism in Russia. Two 
circumstances are distinguished here. 
  Our paramount task is the prevention of conflicts in the 
Russian Federation, which are national in form, and a settlement 
of those that already exist. Without attempting a more detailed 
analysis here, I shall cite the three main causes of such 
conflicts: a recarving of power (the competition or struggle of 
old and new political elites in the regions), a recarving of 
ownership, and the activity of organized crime. 
  The national form of a conflict is chosen by their 
organizers 
as the most "suitable," the one that most disguises the true 
aims of the political forces behind these conflicts. 
Unfortunately, a new aspect of national conflicts could soon 
appear. Conflicts could develop on not just a bilateral basis 
(Ossetian-Ingush, Ossetian-Georgian, Georgian-Abkhaz, and so 
forth). The Russian population could be involved in them, with 
weapon in hand, what is more. 
  This circumstance would switch the conflicts to an entirely 
different phase. In interaction with the authorities of the 
regions in the Russian Federation the federal authorities must 
avert this danger, therefore. 
  Further, on the right of nations to self-determination. The 
right to self-determination can and should be guaranteed in the 
Russian Federation, except merely for one form of such 
self-determination, namely, detachment from the Russian 
Federation. Formulation of the question of the rights of nations 
to self-determination, up to and including the formation of an 
independent state and its separation from Russia, would under 
the conditions of the Russian state necessarily raise the 
question of the form in which the Russian nation might 
constitute itself. 
  If we take the path of a "Russian republic" (and there are 
forces interested in this), it needs to be borne in mind that 
whereas for Zhirinovskiy a Russian republic means the USSR in 
its former dimensions, for other leaders a Russian republic 
means the sum total of krays and oblasts of the Russian 
Federation less the other autonomous formations. 
  An attempt to draw the borders of a new Russian republic 
would end in these borders running not only across regions but 
also across human souls, across our families. This would be an 
absolutely hopeless and bloody path. It needs to be recognized 
officially that the Russian Federation is the common form of 
state self-determination of all peoples and national groups of 
the country. In addition, the Russian Federation is the form of 
the self-determination of all its citizens, regardless of the 
nationality to which they belong. It is the common home within 
which there is sufficient room for all forms of 
self-organization. 
  Fundamental importance in the national aspects of federalism 
is attached to a revival of the concept of national-cultural 
autonomy. And not only and not so much even in the forms in 
which they were developed by Bauer and other ideologists. In my 
view, there is a possibility of the harmonious unification of 
the concept of national-cultural autonomy and a well-developed 
concept of local government. This would make it possible to 
devise specific organizational forms and realize at local 
government level the majority of the current national, economic, 
and political rights of all peoples and nationalities of the 
Russian Federation. 
  Concerning Chechnya. A situation where for a very long 
period 
of time 1.2 million Russian citizens have lived outside of the 
protection of the Russian Constitution and legality and where 
crime rages and thousands of families have been forced to leave 
their homes cannot be tolerated. The federal authorities must 
regard a settlement of relations with Chechnya as a priority 
problem for preservation of the federative principles of the 
Russian state and the development of the Russian Federation 
itself. 
  The position should be, in my view, as follows. 
  The federal authorities can and should agree to a treaty 
delineating terms of reference and authority with the organs of 
state power of the Chechen Republic. It is necessary to proceed 
here from the fact that the free, voluntary delegation and 
distribution of authority is essentially the highest form of 
manifestation of sovereignty and independence. But the condition 
of the signing of such a treaty must be free elections to the 
organs of power of Chechnya with the participation of the 
opposition and the participation of the inhabitants of this 
republic in elections to the federal parliament. 
  There is one further dimension to the problem of 
federalism--"federalism and the multiparty system." I am 
profoundly convinced that Russia can endure and strengthen as a 
free state only if two or three major and truly nationwide 
political parties, which would be the political pivot of the 
federal state, arise in it. It will be very difficult to create 
and retain a federative state in Russia by legal and economic 
mechanisms alone. "Federalism and the multiparty system"--this 
proposition echoes the proposition that the Federation is for 
Russia the territorial form of democracy. 
  In conclusion I would like to emphasize once more that the 
rescuing strategy for Russia should be one based on three 
propositions--federalism, a socially oriented market economy, 
and local government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmitriy Bednyakov, mayor of Nizhniy </F>
Novgorod, conducted by NOVOYE VREMYA correspondent: "Revenge 
Will Not Pass in Nizhniy Novgorod, City's Mayor Affirms on the 
Eve of the Elections"] 
  [Text] The elections of the oblast and city administrations 
are drawing near. One of the co-authors of the law on 
privatization, and most importantly--the author of many 
practical matters, Dmitriy Bednyakov, is running for the office 
of mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod, the third largest city in Russia. 
In the elections of 1991, the 39-year old Bednyakov did not get 
the majority of votes and was appointed acting mayor by edict of 
the president. 
  The head of administration of Nizhegorod Oblast, Boris 
Nemtsov, despite his youth, is one of the most well-known 
Russian politicians. However, few pay attention to the fact that 
he would hardly have been able to achieve success in 
transforming the oblast had he not worked with like-minded 
people, among whom we should list primarily the city's mayor, 
Dmitriy Bednyakov, and the chairman of the oblast soviet, 
Aleksandr Krestyaninov... 
  And today, Dmitriy Bednyakov answers the questions 
posed by NOVOYE VREMYA. 
  [Correspondent] What are you taking to the elections? 
  [Bednyakov] I am not a proponent of program statements, but 
I 
am in my third year of work now and clearly understand that only 
he who will be able to manage in the channel of interests of the 
common man can expect victory in the elections, regardless of 
the level at which these elections are held. 
  [Correspondent] As far as I know, reforms in Nizhegorod 
Oblast have been implemented according to the conception: "First 
develop optimal economic mechanisms in the local areas, and then 
delegate rights to the center, based on the interests of the 
region." 
  [Bednyakov] We have done many things independently and more 
quickly than others. This concerns both privatization and the 
support of enterprise. This also concerns the mutual relations 
with large industrialists, as well as the policy of social 
protection of the population. However, I would like to say that 
reforms generally depend on one very important thing--on the 
presence of political will. 
  We may understand the goals of reform differently, perceive 
the tactics differently, and act differently. However, in order 
to have any kind of results, we must first have the desire for 
them. All our actions are subordinate to a dual task. On one 
hand, we are striving to reform the economy, and on the other 
hand we have combined reforms (and they, as is the case 
everywhere, are accompanied both by liberalization of prices and 
by demonopolization) with measures on social protection. 
  For example, on 7 January 1992, seven days after 
liberalization of prices, we lifted price controls on milk. But 
at the same time we allocated budget funds to support certain 
categories of people. Every month these people got 70 rubles (R) 
each. Today this is a laughable sum of money. But in January 
1992 it would buy one liter of milk a day for an entire month. 
And on the whole this measure allowed us to save considerable 
budget funds. 
  On 24 March 1992, we lifted price controls on bread and gave 
a subsidy of R260 a month to some categories of people (only 
some!)--invalids, families with many children and pensioners. In 
May of 1992 we increased the subsidy, and then changed over to 
individual subsidies using the so-called application order. As 
of 1 October of last year, we introduced a poverty subsidy, 
which is paid to those whose level of income is below the 
minimum subsistence level. 
  As of 1 January 1993, we have not had coupons for food 
products. The last ones I repealed were coupons for sugar. One 
may promise from the "soapbox": "I will never repeal coupons. I 
will retain prices at their former level. I guarantee each 
person 200 grams of carmel candy, and everything else." Yet all 
the while prices will still be increasing, and products will be 
disappearing from the shelves. Yet we have said firmly: "Yes, 
prices in different stores will be different, and perhaps will 
change in the course of the day." At first people could not get 
used to this. Yet now even pensioners, even war veterans who 
have become accustomed to buying their goods in specialized 
stores at fixed prices, ask only that the goods be closer to 
home. 
  Here are some economic indicators. The number of state 
enterprises for 1993 is 4.5 percent of their overall number. The 
relative share of non-state enterprises in budget revenues for 
1992 was 12 percent, while in 1993 it was already 73 percent. 
There are no social conflicts. 
  In 1992 the decline in production in Russia comprised 19.9 
percent. In Nizhegorod Oblast, which suffered all the ills of 
the Russian regions, it was 7.6 percent, while in Nizhniy 
Novgorod it was 2.4 percent. 
  In 1993 the decline throughout Russia was once again 20 
percent, while in Nizhegorod Oblast it was a little over 7 
percent and in Nizhniy Novgorod it was around 4 percent. 
  [Correspondent] Do you have any real competitors in the 
elections? 
  [Bednyakov] There are several competitors with whom there 
are 
no principle ideological divergences. Those who speak out for 
slowing of reforms, I believe, are doomed. The LDPR 
[Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia], for example, is submitting 
a candidate named Buslayev. A man by that name has already put 
all of Russia on its ear once. The communists are presenting 
their own man. But, it seems, they will not even be able to 
gather enough signatures. I have not yet seen or heard any 
distinct programs. 
  [Correspondent] Will you be able to win the region in the 
case of some cardinal changes in the political course of the 
country? 
  [Bednyakov] I am sure of that. There were R70 billion which 
settled in the Savings Bank for last year alone. The level of 
consumption has remained practically unchanged in two years. New 
stores have opened--around 700 of them. No efforts to resurrect 
state regulation will pass here.

<F P=106> [Dialogue between Petr Romanov and Aleksandr Prokhanov; </F>
place and date not given: "A Russian Engineer, I Was Forced To 
Become a Politician..."] 
  [Text] [Prokhanov] In the definition of a political friend 
of mine, you, Petr Vasilyevich, are a rapidly rising political 
star. I heard about you long ago, but we met only this winter, 
bitter and formidable, when I came to Siberia, to your native 
Krasnoyarsk. The center of Siberian industry was dying, like a 
beached whale. And only your plant--it is hard to call it a 
plant, it is a small civilization, a city within a city--was 
continuing to live, struggle, breathe, and fight. We exchanged 
our values, our ideology, for the first time then. 
  You are a technocrat. This is a rarity, a find, for the 
patriotic movement. Members of the opposition are liberal arts 
figures, philologists, legal scholars, and historians, as a 
rule. You, though, are the bearer of immense production 
engineering knowledge and organizational experience. You are 
linked with modernity, with industry, with the idea of 
technotronic development. Your activity in the Russian National 
Assembly and proximity to the top opposition leaders have 
created for you a firm reputation as a state absolutist and 
Russian patriot. 
  You became a politician. You became a member of this hastily 
formed institution of power--the Federation Council. You 
essentially won the fight with Shumeyko for in order to 
forestall you he had to accumulate all the influence of the 
president and the prime minister backing him. 
  What do you, a Siberian, a plant director, an industrialist, 
feel, having found yourself in this cauldron of new Moscow 
politics? Your feelings from interaction with this environment? 
  [Romanov] I never previously felt myself to be a politician. 
This is now the most dangerous period of my life. Military 
pilots say: "Watch out for them winging you during takeoff." 
They did not. Figuratively speaking, I am as yet gaining 
cruising speed. Then it will be time for the plans which I 
brought with me here and which I would like to embody via the 
Federation Council. Decent people have been elected. I will 
contribute to their philosophy the spirit of the 
military-industrial complex. 
  When, prior to the vote on the candidates for the position 
of 
chairman of the Federation Council, I was asked whether I had 
any experience of parliamentary business, I replied honestly 
that I did not. I have now built up some such experience. It is 
negative: The political forces with which I have come into 
contact and the institutions I have entered are not all that 
disposed to work for national unification. I mean by this the 
mutual understanding and interaction of all who wish to survive 
in Russia and make it great. Political persons and the conflicts 
connected with them are ultimately transient. How many there 
have been.... And if the country stands, has not crumbled, state 
instincts are still, consequently, alive. It is simply that they 
just cannot become policy and ideology. 
  Unification is occurring as yet merely within institutions 
and parties and groups of politicians. Even recently the 
patriots were sharply criticizing the State Duma for 
amorphousness and conciliation. But the Duma, without even 
touching on the subject of the amnesty, has shown that the most 
diverse politicians are disposed to act together in strategic 
areas. Were this unification to go beyond the framework of 
parties and institutions, I would feel better in Moscow politics. 
  As far as my technocratic experience, as you put it, is 
concerned, I met with many plant outfits in Krasnoyarsk and 
heard one and the same thing everywhere: "We have to work." The 
plants are buckling under the arrears, and wages have not been 
paid for months--and people are working, they want to work. This 
cannot be said of Moscow politicians. 
  A Russian engineer, I was forced to become a politician. 
  [Prokhanov] You speak about unification, the composition of 
the efforts of the parties, the composition of the tendencies of 
politicians, each of whom has his own vector, his own political 
pace, his own experience of catastrophe or victory. I, and not 
only myself, am tormented by one question. For three or four 
years we patriots have been attempting to compose a party of 
national interests, a patriotic party based on the national idea. 
  It cannot be said that these attempts appear absolutely 
barren. Small political formations: the Russian Revival Party, 
the Russian Party of Mikhail Korchagin, have been formed. The 
Slav Assembly has been created. Among the most dynamic is 
Russian National Unity. There was the attempt to create the 
Russian National Assembly, in which you actively participated. 
The National Salvation Front was squashed. All other attempts 
are coming to naught. Everything is confined to a conference, a 
congress, at which declarations are made, then organizational 
apathy sets in, all movements come to a halt.... 
  Why are we unsuccessful here? Is it not because unduly 
blurred, unduly archaic political formulas such as 
"Orthodoxy-autocracy-national character" or "Russian solidarity" 
are made the basis of them, these parties and their ideology? 
Today's Russia is a multidimensional pulsating structure, in 
which each region has its own version of the Russian idea. 
  In addition, the present Russia does not have a traditional 
look. It is oriented toward the future. Perhaps none of these 
pariahs has a future image, all their values are too tied to the 
past, and they are unable to adapt tradition to history and 
actual policy? 
  [Romanov] But in just the same way it has not been possible 
to create a "presidential" party either. Comminution is a 
feature of Russian politics. The communists are fragmented, like 
the democrats also. What significance have all these Moscow 
parties for the ordinary man? Go to the periphery, as they say 
in Moscow, call in at a shop or a cowshed, and ask if only: 
"What is the Constitutional Court, who is on it?" It is not 
known. Even less is anything known about patriotic politicians. 
  I see as the solution for the patriots the creation of a 
supra-party bloc based on the center parties with a negligible 
tilt to the left, but under no circumstances to the right. The 
leaders of parties and movements should step beyond party 
ambitions, sit down at the table, and come to some agreement. 
This supra-party bloc of politicians should go to the people 
with an intelligible program of national salvation. I do not 
believe that its success would depend on how far it operated 
with outmoded ideologies and how it modernized the 
"Orthodoxy-autocracy-national character" principle. It would 
depend on whom it persuaded: the Moscow "mass meeting" or those 
who have their hands on the levers of the economy and power. 
  Such a program is a latent need of both the opposition and 
the authorities. I heard and read the president's speech in the 
Federal Assembly. Even he, having become, according to the new 
constitution, the head of state, is now uttering words 
inconceivable from his mouth three or four months ago. He has 
willy-nilly been forced to size up the situation in the country 
and to construct his--albeit deficient, hypocritical--program in 
conformity with it. 
  The president spoke in sufficient detail about what needs to 
be done. But everyone knows this, as it is, I believe. Were an 
opposition supra-party bloc to explain how it should be done, it 
would have a chance to win. 
  The politicians who are a part of the bloc must necessarily 
identify stages and arrange landmarks en route to the 
goal--promise-landmarks. After all, Khrushchev's "the present 
generation of Soviet people will live under communism" was not 
fortuitous. It showed that these authorities understood the 
importance of the possession, in your definition, Aleksandr 
Andreyevich, of a future image, albeit "incorrect." They, the 
politicians, must not be afraid to take on themselves--to the 
extent of their influence--economic assignments also. Set them 
six months ahead, say, providing them with resources.... 
  [Prokhanov] I listened to the president's speech with a 
double feeling, catching in his vocabulary all the words and 
ideas that we patriots have over three years formulated and 
offered society and for which we have acquired the title of 
"conservatives" and "red-browns." He outlined distinctly, in 
party and oblast party committee fashion, the contours of the 
catastrophe that has struck Russia. He omitted just one thing: 
who created the catastrophe. Or was it these "red-browns" who 
brought the country to disintegration, the stoppage of the 
plants, the exorbitant prices? 
  Each day on my way to work I pass the Frunzenskaya 
Embankment, I see daily the enormous Buran--the Russian 
spacecraft--reminiscent of a once beautiful, but now dead, 
creature. I was at Baykonur when Buran, having accomplished an 
unmanned space circuit, landed on the scorching pad. I remember 
the exultant face of Oleg Baklanov, I remember my own 
exultation: my state ruled in near-Earth space.... 
  And now Buran has been trotted out posthumously as a 
laughing-stock. What will be made from it: a bordello, a 
restaurant, a public restroom? It is like spoils taken on the 
field of battle from the vanquished USSR. 
  So let us be told who the author of this catastrophe is. Let 
us be told that it was wrought by Gaydar and Yeltsin, Fedorov 
and Shumeyko. 
  Two symptomatic blabbings have been agitating minds as of 
late. On the eve of Clinton's visit the following political 
formula appeared in the American press and was relayed to Russia 
by CNN: "America will have to choose between the shock therapy 
of Gaydar, which, of course, would weaken Russia to the United 
States' advantage, and a new, more moderate policy, which would 
preserve Russian potential to some extent, but would protect 
Russia against a social explosion which could sweep away the 
supporters of reforms." 
  And recently Gavriil Popov, the superdemocrat, published a 
program perceived as an attempt to crawl from beneath the rubble 
of the present political period. He acknowledges in this program 
that Gaydar's shock therapy was thought up by the Americans to 
destroy Russia's military-industrial complex. 
  This was said when our submarines stand fast at the piers, 
when the missile and tank plants are at a standstill, and when 
the test ranges are dying, military supertechnology is 
disintegrating, and young intellectuals are going into commerce 
and pimping. This was said by Popov, whose contribution to the 
collapse was immense. 
  So why do you members of parliament not name publicly the 
culprits of the catastrophe before embarking on the restoration 
of Russia? 
  [Romanov] Why are we not delivering angry philippics against 
the "regime"? Well, we ourselves, the corps of directors, are to 
blame for what has happened. And now we face the prospect of a 
shutdown of production--not random, not partial, but total. This 
would signify the collapse of the economy and statehood and 
national catastrophe. 
  Yes, Gaydar and Fedorov have gone. Were we to shout curses 
after them, we would have to back them up with action also. Stop 
the plants? Trigger a directors' strike? What's the use.... 
  Our real fault is that we are today, now, not saying, not 
venturing to tell Chernomyrdin, Soskovets, and Gerashchenko: 
"Stop. Let's take a look. We acknowledge that on account of a 
number of Russia's geographical and geopolitical circumstances a 
market economy may be created even theoretically only in 
European Russia, along the Trans-Siberian Railroad, at that. We 
acknowledge that we need a transitional period, that we will not 
crawl out of the present pit without emergency economic 
measures. And for this reason the present inflationary drift, 
when only the idle are not managing to shake money loose from 
the cabinet, is intolerable. A realistic program of salvation 
and reconstruction of the dying economy is needed." 
  [Prokhanov] I know that you, Petr Vasilyevich, are working 
on 
a multitude of program documents. Could you not briefly give us 
the essence of this transitional period and these emergency 
measures and the methodology with which it is possible to halt 
the catastrophe and undertake the plastic transformation of our 
tormented economy into a new quality connected with development. 
  [Romanov] Russia has two paths, in my view. 
  The first is to "pupate," to go into isolation, and to 
tackle 
all problems, technological and structural modernization 
included, thanks only to our own internal resources, becoming a 
strong national state. Russia should imbibe, figuratively 
speaking, the umbilical cords, protruding from its body, of the 
defunct empire, lines of communication, and infrastructure that 
linked it only recently with the former Soviet republics. But 
this would take, considering the scale of the present collapse, 
60-70 years. 
  The second is to accept the role of "raw material" state 
being imposed by the "world community," making in this sense a 
temporary concession. Russia would export raw material and 
import technology and would one day once again become a strong, 
but not isolated, national state, slowly once again assembling 
the empire. 
  Unless a benign political miracle occurs, the actual 
development of Russia will choose a path between these two not 
all that optimistic options. 
  What emergency measures are possible in these contours? 
Regardless of the forms of property, it is necessary to 
administer in centralized fashion in conjunction with the 
territories all the extractive sectors, power engineering, 
transport, and foreign economic activity. 
  It is essential to introduce strict price control of the 
economy via a lowering of outlays in the production sectors and 
differentiated tax rates for brokerage, commercial, financial, 
and banking services. A consolidated government contract by 
sector is needed simultaneously. We would in this way 
immediately be giving the Russian manufacturer priority. He 
would henceforward know precisely what profit he would make in 
production, and what, in commerce, and how much he would lose in 
taxes. 
  All investment funds, banks, and other similar financial 
institutions should be adroitly oriented toward investment in 
efficient works with a necessary government guarantee in the 
event of a failure to achieve the contemplated efficiency. 
  It does not need to be said that the activity of the State 
Property Committee and the Antitrust Committee of the Russian 
Federation would be suspended for the period of the emergency 
measures. 
  It is essential to sharply limit, to "suppress," imports of 
consumer goods, primarily durables, if, of course, these 
prohibitions do not entail the danger of starvation. Each bottle 
of Italian mineral water on the Krasnoyarsk shelves means a 
dollar not invested in the Russian economy. And investments have 
declined in Russia by a factor of six or seven since 1991 as it 
is. This, incidentally, is a special problem barely soluble 
within the framework of emergency measures alone. 
  It is necessary also to establish sectoral wage 
differentiation, movement beyond the framework of which should 
entail severe penalties. 
  Finally, for the Russians coming to us from the near abroad 
we need to create jobs in the agro-industrial zones which are 
promising from the viewpoint of the market economy. The move 
should, of course, be undertaken in planned fashion, with the 
simultaneous closure of works that have no future. 
  [Prokhanov] This is akin to a plan for the restoration of 
the 
national economy after a war. It creates an ideological field, 
toward which the people are predisposed. The people must 
understand that they have been bombed to destruction. And that 
we will have to restore the devastated cities and lines of 
communication and also human relations by way of the injection 
in the restoration of the surplus quantity of our own calories. 
  [Romanov] Yes, belt-tightening once again, for the umpteenth 
time.... Agrarian problems were discussed recently in a 
committee of the upper house of parliament. I said that no 
government financial injections would in themselves save the 
situation. We need a program of salvation of the agrarian 
complex--as specific as possible, for a year or 18 months to two 
years. And for the sake of it, this program, we would tighten 
our belts. And the people would understand were there at least 
some changes for the better in two years. 
  [Prokhanov] You have spoken about the creation of a national 
political alliance, a congress of politicians, and have drawn 
its boundaries, in which tremendous political potential is 
condensed. It means, most likely, not only politicians and their 
parties and allies but also vast social groups and classes. The 
working class, peasantry, technical and liberal arts 
intelligentsia, and even the new bourgeoisie to some extent. On 
what kind of base do you conceive of the creation of this 
alliance? On the basis of the State Duma or in the garb of a new 
political super-organization? 
  [Romanov] We need to think sooner about ideology than about 
organization and to find comprehensible, plastic slogans 
explaining reality and outlining--once again I avail myself of 
your term, Aleksandr Andreyevich--a future image, an image of 
the near future. 
  After all, whatever one's attitude toward the Bolsheviks, it 
has to be admitted that ideologically they operated very 
dexterously in 1917. They did not say that they had appointed 
Russia "to set alight the fire of world revolution." They said: 
"Peace to the peoples, the land to the peasants, the plants and 
factories to the workers!" 
  We should be understood by all: from the nationally oriented 
"bourgeois" to the retirees who are living by begging. The 
"bourgeois" need to be told that if they begin to build national 
industry, they will be exempted from taxes. And they do not need 
to be told what this means. If, however, they start simply to 
"turn over money," the financial inspector will have them in his 
clutches. And only this way, not the other way about. We will 
offer retirees selective social programs. And so forth. 
  So if such a program is taken up, I am prepared on my 
responsibility to formulate and put into practice what my city 
and my sector need. Not debate, it is necessary, I repeat, to do 
something and to know how to do it. 
  [Prokhanov] You are a general director. You should lead a 
technocratic train into this political bloc. You have the 
authority of a man and the subtle internal laws and tendencies 
of the corps of directors. I have, I confess, long ceased to 
understand what is happening in it.... 
  [Romanov] The same as in the country. 
  [Prokhanov] In the good old days I knew this very stratum of 
directors. I saw their tragedy, the smashing of the corps of 
directors in Gorbachev's times. At first they came to elect 
them, the directors, gave them over to be torn to pieces by the 
mob.... 
  [Romanov] Remember how Gorbachev on many occasions said in 
public: Let's fall on the bureaucracy together, we, from above, 
you, the people, from below? 
  [Prokhanov] Yes, this was the first blow at the base stratum 
of the Soviet state. The directors then came to be persecuted, 
and they were declared the "principal conservatives" and the 
exponents of the "communist conspiracy." They were defamed as, 
virtually, the "second structure after the KGB impeding 
perestroyka." While having sustained heavy losses, the corps of 
directors withstood these two blows, nonetheless. 
  Subsequently, against their wishes, the directors awoke one 
day as multi-millionaires, virtually. The oblast property 
committees appointed for them super-high salaries, and they were 
permitted via easily obtainable licenses to engage in the 
commercial exportation of products overseas. 
  [Romanov] But, despite this, the directors held the work 
force together and prevented it disintegrating. Nor do they all 
have such super-high salaries--in my circle, at least. 
  [Prokhanov] But as of late many of the directors whom I know 
have had the constant feeling that this "small social world" at 
the enterprises is on the verge of disintegration. The directors 
are cringing beneath the sullen looks of the workers.... 
  [Romanov] They are right to have this feeling, possibly. 
After all, for the past eight years the authorities have done 
everything to keep the directors out of politics and to ensure 
that they not perceive their responsibility for the enterprise 
on the scale of the association, the main administration, the 
sector, or the economy as a whole and that they get used to 
feeling that they are "on their own." 
  I remember Kremlin meetings under Gorbachev and Silayev. 
Even 
then we directors were speaking at the top of our voices about 
the crisis, about how to get out of it. There was a great deal 
of talk, but nothing was done. Subsequently various forces on a 
multitude of occasions attempted to place the directors beneath 
the most diverse political banners. Ultimately they threw up 
their hands and concentrated on the problems of their own 
enterprises. And it was at this moment that they ceased to be 
for the workers representatives of the state at their 
enterprise, and they have not yet become regular capitalist 
bosses. 
  Nonetheless, you are right: The corps of directors is still 
a 
real force incorporating also an organized structure, possession 
of the keys to technology, and a social infrastructure. And for 
this reason the struggle for it will continue. 
  [Prokhanov] Volskiy's attempt to capture the affections of 
the corps of directors, accumulate it in the Party of 
Industrialists, and create a political battering-ram from the 
directors is the best known. Against the background of 
Tizyakov's aborted attempt, it appeared successful for some 
time. Tizyakov was dislodged from politics after August 1991. 
Volskiy evaporated in October 1993. 
  Quite recently Skokov held in your parts, Krasnoyarsk, a 
congress of the Federation of Commodity Producers of Russia. I 
saw him after this. He is a strong politician and a connoisseur 
of the corps of directors, but he is by no means certain of the 
success of his mission--the national consolidation of the 
technocrats. 
  Is it possible, in your view, to consolidate the directors 
politically and teach them to uphold the political interests of 
their corporation, not only of the economic lobbies? And who 
could do this? The directors have been rejecting one leader 
after another.... 
  [Romanov] Permit me to disagree: First of all, it is not a 
question of leaders but of ideology. Only ideology drives the 
army, only thanks to ideology do the lines of communication run, 
only it consolidates the classes. But the directors cannot have 
their own, "directors'" ideology. But there is formally no 
official ideology either. It is not known whether statehood 
itself exists or not. 
  It seems to me that we need only say the word, the main 
word. 
Pose the problems on whose resolution the corps of directors, 
sober-minded government officers administering territories and 
fearing a social explosion, and national entrepreneurs could 
consolidate. 
  A mobilization plan is needed for the salvation of Russia. 
And it is in it, in this plan, that an "informal" official 
ideology, an official instinct, should be manifested. And I am 
afraid that if in the coming weeks what I have attempted to 
formulate is not stated publicly, this initiative will have been 
intercepted.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Vaganov: "National Security as a Systemic </F>
Problem: An In-House Scientific Council Has Been Created in the 
Structure of the Security Council of Russia"] 
  [Text] The Scientific Council (SC) under the auspices of 
the Security Council of the Russian Federation, which was formed 
by Edict No. 1807 of the president of the Russian Federation of 
1 November 1993, held its first meeting last Friday. 
"Organizational-presentational" was how Academician Vladimir 
Pirumov, chairman of the SC and vice president of the Russian 
Academy of Natural Sciences, defined its tasks. The creation of 
such a structure in the system of the highest state authorities 
is an unprecedented step for Russia. 
  As Vladimir Pirumov declared, there is an insistent need 
today for the shaping of official policy in respect to the 
protection of man, society, and the environment against the 
ever-increasing impact of a variety of dangers. The preliminary 
structure of the research work of the SC will include such 
sections as foreign policy, defense, economic, and environmental 
security and the fight against crime and information security. 
In addition, the Scientific Council is being entrusted with 
tasks of legal and information-analytical support for the 
activity of the machinery of the Security Council, the 
preparation of analytical material, and scientific expert 
evaluation and tutorials on various federal programs. 
  In the geopolitical situation in which the present Russia 
has 
found itself, it is no longer possible to adopt the principle of 
the separate assurance of security for each enumerated sphere. 
This is becoming a truly comprehensive, systemic problem. On the 
other hand, it is impossible to protect each and 
everything--there are neither the money nor the forces. The need 
to determine priorities in the sphere of security is absolutely 
obvious. The difficulty of the work for the SC will be 
primarily, evidently, finding the resultant of these 
varidirectional vectors of interests. It was for this reason 
that there was such a long and careful selection of the 
composition of the Scientific Council. It consists of 27 
persons. They include, for example, Anatoliy Alekseyev, chief of 
the Russian Federation MVD Academy, Sergey Dyakov, chief of the 
Russian Federation FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service] 
Academy, Vitaliy Zhurkin, academician-secretary of the 
Department of Problems of World Economics and International 
Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Nikolay Karlov, 
chairman of the VAK [precise expansion unknown; possibly Supreme 
Arbitration Commission] of Russia, Yevgeniy Severin, general 
director of the All-Russia Scientific Center of Molecular 
Diagnostics and Treatment, and Vyacheslav Senchagov, rector of 
the Economics Academy of the Ministry of Economics of Russia. 
The other members of the SC are also burdened with no less high 
degrees, titles, and positions. It is anticipated that five 
"branch" groups will be created within the SC: public health 
care and environmental safety, assessment of foreign policy 
activity and defense and information security, conversion, and 
economic, and a public and state security group. 
  The work plans of the SC for 1994 include discussion of 
measures to limit the exodus of specialists and figures of 
science and culture abroad, questions of scientific and 
technological cooperation with foreign countries, a 
strengthening of the legal and organizational principles of the 
use and protection of Russia's scientific achievements, and 
scientific and technological problems of the equipping, arming, 
and special outfitting of servicemen. 
  Initially, however, members of the SC will, evidently, be 
dealing with more prosaic matters. It was felt at the first 
meeting that a system of interaction of the SC and the Security 
Council has yet to be worked out. In addition, the efficiency of 
the work of the Scientific Council could perfectly well be 
reduced unless problems of a purely internal nature are avoided. 
Thus it is contemplated that the SC will be centrally funded 
(according to information available to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, it 
will receive approximately R3 billion in 1994). The client of 
the work will be the Security Council. And although it is 
stipulated that this money must under no circumstances go to 
subsidize this department or research institute or the other, 
only a specific group of executants, it will, perhaps, be very 
difficult to avoid lobbying attempts on the part of members of 
the SC for their "own" structures. 
  The integration of existing efforts in the sphere of 
security 
in the programs planned for execution by the SC will be no less 
complex a problem. 
  And, finally, lest the SC become a kind of elite club of 
Moscow intellectuals, it will be necessary to give serious 
thought to how to make rational use in its work of Russia's 
regional research.

<F P=106> [Interview with Federal Counterintelligence Service officers </F>
Sergey Bogdanov and Sergey Vorobyev by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA 
editors and correspondents; prepared and recorded by Oleg 
Blotskiy; date not given: "Lubyanka: A Strange Place for Its Own 
People?"] 
  [Text] The KGB is being divided and branched out, 
plaques taken down and different ones hung, top officials 
endlessly replaced. 
  Had it only been plaques and bosses... Growing tired of 
spasmodic and senseless reforms, experienced officers are 
leaving--those who did not go around chasing "skinheads" but 
were doing serious work combating crime and espionage. 
  To explain what is happening at Lubyanka, Federal 
Counterintelligence Service officers Sergey Bogdanov and Sergey 
Vorobyev visited the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA investigations 
department. 
  Yu. Shchekochikhin, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA investigations 
department editor: What is really happening over there 
these days? 
  S. Bogdanov, Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) 
officer: What is happening? The border troops are now an 
independent service subordinate directly to the president. The 
investigative department has been eliminated, as has the 
administration for investigations and corresponding units on the 
local level--in territorial administrations. These are probably 
the most significant among structural changes. 
  Thanks to public pressure, so far rehabilitation work has 
remained with us. GULAG veterans were extremely concerned that 
corresponding units would be eliminated. So far this line of 
work remains ours. 
  We now have about 75,000 staff members left. 
  Yu. Shchekochikhin: Where do your officers go? 
  S. Bogdanov: Staff reductions occurred mainly in 
the border troops and the investigative apparatus. Keeping in 
mind, however, that the former Ministry of Security [MB] was on 
average 20 percent understaffed, those who want to be in the 
service and pass the certification do not have any problem. 
  O. Blotskiy, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special 
correspondent: What are the selection criteria? 
  S. Bogdanov: We were informed that the main 
criteria are professional fitness and loyalty to the motherland. 
  D. Molchanov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special 
correspondent: How does one determine professional fitness? 
  S. Bogdanov: I am not a commission member and do 
not know how it is determined. 
  D. Molchanov: Do you see in the latest actions 
regarding the MB an element of strengthening the president's 
personal power? 
  S. Bogdanov: Theoretically--yes. In practice we 
will only be able to tell after we get specific assignments over 
a period of half a year. 
  Yu. Shchekochikhin: According to our information, 
many state security functions have now been transferred to the 
president's Main Protection Administration. 
  S. Bogdanov: In the past there was the KGB's Ninth 
Directorate. Part of the work of a number of units in the rest 
of the KGB was to support operational work of this directorate: 
operational information, operational investigations, and so on. 
  In principle, the Ninth Directorate's task was physical 
protection of the president. As to operational work around 
protected objects, including protected routes, this was done, 
among others, by staff members of the Moscow Administration. 
When the Main Protection Directorate was created, this unit was 
transferred there as a whole. Those who did not want a transfer 
stayed in the Moscow Administration. 
  Yu. Shchekochikhin: Where is the pay better--over 
there or with you? 
  S. Vorobyev, FCS officer: Over there, of course. 
  Yu. Shchekochikhin: Let us go back to politics. 
There have been many complaints about the MB in connection with 
the October 1993 events: The MB did not know what had been going 
on, they said. 
  S. Vorobyev: An organization that does not know 
what is happening around it would not be a special service. The 
question is who is the consumer of this information and how is 
it used. We knew, and provided this information. 
  S. Bogdanov: Materials of preliminary 
investigation on the basis of mass media reports regarding 
Barkashov were sent to the procuracy three times. But the latter 
did not find sufficient grounds to initiate criminal proceedings. 
  Celestine Bohlen, NEW YORK TIMES correspondent: I 
would like to go back to the October events. Do you think that 
the MB reorganization is related to these events? 
  S. Bogdanov: Probably yes. Going back to these 
events, I want to remind you that we knew about the plans, the 
concrete disposition of forces, up to how many combat 
detachments and commandos there were and which window bay or 
corridor they would be guarding. Therefore nobody can say it was 
an unexpected turn of events. The main issue is utilization of 
information. 
  I can tell as an example how the information on Chernobyl 
was 
used. A year before the catastrophe, 76 documents were sent from 
KGB units to various officials saying that these industrial 
nuclear systems cannot be used for scientific purposes. Nobody 
listened to us. 
  The same goes for the Bashkiria oil pipeline. While it was 
still under construction we were getting alarming information 
from foreign agents. 
  S. Vorobyev: We were sent a lot of materials, even 
aerial photos taken from a helicopter. We showed those six bent 
pipes on television. And what happened? I believe there is still 
no decision on it. 
  S. Bogdanov: This is all about the past; what 
about now? Have you even asked yourself how many times the 
initials of our institution have been changed over the past 
years? Do you know what this means? This means a change of 
leadership from top to bottom, not only the head of the 
organization, but all top officials. And from the day this all 
started, it still goes on. Tell me, how can a special service 
work under these circumstances? 
  Yu. Shchekochikhin: Will the latest change in 
initials help to correct the situation you were talking about? 
  S. Bogdanov: It depends on how long these initials 
stay. 
  S. Vorobyev: By the way, many officers are not 
certain that things are not going to be reshuffled again. 
  S. Bogdanov: Every time there are elections, there 
is change. 
  S. Vorobyev: Today our officers formally separated 
from their work. This sitting and waiting, which has been going 
on for the second month already, results in people's skills as 
operatives gradually beginning to deteriorate. If this situation 
continues for any length of time, we cannot be sure that a mass 
exodus to the civilian sector will not begin. 
  O. Blotskiy: Your investigative department is now 
being transferred to the procuracy. Cases have been transferred, 
but the personnel do not want to. What is happening to the 
investigative officers? 
  S. Bogdanov: Right now most officers do not want a 
transfer. They will be found jobs in our organization. 
  C. Bohlen: Why do they not want to transfer? 
  S. Bogdanov: You know, it is the same as happened 
to the Vympel unit. People came to work specifically for state 
security. And they do not want to leave this organization. It 
has its own traditions, its own system of relations, its own 
perks after all. 
  Yu. Shchekochikhin: How do you feel about the fact 
that investigations will now be carried out by the procuracy 
instead of the KGB? Some jurists have been pushing this for a 
long time, while others were against it... 
  S. Bogdanov: Right now, for instance, one of the 
contraband cases has been transferred to the procuracy for 
investigation, and the man in charge of it has specialized in 
murders and rapes all his life. 
  D. Molchanov: How do you feel about the old KGB 
times? From a professional standpoint. 
  S. Bogdanov: I will give a most routine example. 
There was a Moscow Administration chief who could transfer his 
aide out of sight if the telephone in reception rang twice and 
nobody picked up the receiver. That is, on the third ring you 
knew for sure that you had just lost your year-end bonus. Now 
you can listen to the phone ringing for half an hour. 
  D. Molchanov: Now you cannot get through at all. 
Nobody answers. Or you call, and they say that such and such is 
not in. Pardon me, I ask, who am I talking to? The person on the 
other end says: "I am just waiting here in the reception and 
answering the phone." (Laughter) 
  Yu. Shchekochikhin: Seriously speaking, however. I 
am convinced that the current government cannot do without the 
special services for its personal needs. Whichever major Russian 
politician I talk to, they are all convinced that their 
telephones are tapped. Do our leaders not need today to have at 
least a personal special service? After all, they are all 
children of those times; they cannot do without it. 
  S. Bogdanov: Any politicians needs to have a 
personal special service--regardless of whether he is an 
offspring of a communist or another state. I have no doubt about 
this. 
  As to telephone tapping, today the respective FCS unit can 
simultaneously listen to 2,000 telephones across the entire 
country of Russia. For comparison: Switzerland has the 
capability of simultaneously listening to 10,000. 
  P. Shirov, "Echo Moskvy": has there been a 
considerable personnel turnover, especially over the past two 
years? 
  S. Bogdanov: We have come to the conclusion that 
the number of resignation letters submitted has fallen off 
considerably. Several years ago there were mass resignations. 
Every time our plaque is changed, the number of resignation 
requests immediately shoots up. Now, however, we have come to a 
point where, in my opinion, the people who are there are 
precisely the kind of people who should be working there. 
  Yu. Shchekochikhin: What happened to the 
administration for combating organized crime and corruption? 
  S. Bogdanov: It became the administration for 
combating smuggling and corruption. 
  O. Blotskiy: What is the FCS reaction to the 
six-year sentence handed down in the case of a CIA agent who was 
arrested and indicted a couple of months ago? 
  S. Bogdanov: The reaction to all these incidents 
and sentences now that there have been traitors among ourselves 
is--tiredness. 
  But when traitors became heroes--after this to talk about 
the 
fact that somebody got six years... 
  C. Bohlen: What about the Mirzayanov case? 
  S. Bogdanov: There is currently a temporary list 
of items constituting state secrets, signed by the president. 
Therefore, in principle, part of the information disclosed by 
Mirzayanov may not fall under that list. If we look at the 
substance, however, it has been established that the information 
he made public constitutes a state secret, but it is not on the 
list. Again, who defines the level of secrecy? It is defined by 
the company doing this development. Not us. No. For us, it is 
very important to have a document that says that this or that is 
information that constitutes a state secret. A specific point. 
  In the past the whole thing boiled down to a company or 
ministry classifying their work according to their list, at the 
request of a laboratory or department. Our duty was to protect 
these secrets. Now we are reaping very grave consequences of 
that system, because at the time it was never considered 
important to patent development work. We have concrete examples: 
Suddenly, for instance, the SS-20 missile is being manufactured 
in, shall we say, a certain large country in the east, and sold 
on foreign markets. We are beginning to investigate how it ended 
up there. 
  It turns out that a foreign delegation visited a certain 
enterprise to sign a protocol of intentions. They promised 
mountains of gold. The director was deliriously happy. (By the 
way, amazingly, most of our directors, especially those of 
defense enterprises, turned out to be great altruists.) He is 
told: "You know, in order for us to figure things out better, we 
need one or two `samples.'" The SS-20 missile alone incorporates 
about 120 inventions. None of which, naturally, had been 
patented. 
  Now, back to the Mirzayanov case. We signed an international 
treaty on not producing new chemical weapons (this is more or 
less what it is called). We violated the convention. But we do 
not have a single word anywhere in the law on anybody's 
culpability for violating an international treaty. On a global 
scale, Mirzayanov has performed a service for humanity. 
  On the other hand, those who work on this problem are 
carrying out the task set for them by the state, because it is 
the state that finances them. 
  Yu. Shchekochikhin: During Brezhnev's times and 
even afterwards, in order to conduct an operational action with 
respect to a secretary of a provincial party oblast committee, 
you needed the sanction of the party leadership. Now I know that 
the operational work of some high-level Moscow officials has 
been stopped at the very top. Is there a category of persons 
today who are better left alone? 
  S. Bogdanov: Of course there is. Who is included 
in this category depends on many factors. And also, let me put 
it this way, on the professional and civic courage of the 
operative and his boss. "Immunity," by the way, also stems from 
imperfections in our legislation. 
  Such new forms of corruption have appeared on the scene now 
that they absolutely do not fall under our criminal law. 
Sometimes, though, the court's terrible inertia also plays a 
role. 
  K. Belyaninov: Representations of the former 
republics have now become embassies. But if there are embassies, 
it means there are also intelligence units. Have you caught, 
for instance, many Uzbek spies? I am quite serious. 
  S. Bogdanov: Uzbek? I do not recall any. With some 
republics, treaties have been signed at the presidential level 
on not conducting intelligence activities against one another, 
interaction in matters of state security or information 
exchange, transfer of cases, joint investigation of major 
entities, combating drug trafficking, etc. 
  One head of an Estonian district counterintelligence was 
detained when he was trying to break through in an "Ural" 
vehicle with five tonnes of copper from Pskov Oblast to his 
district. He stole the vehicle in the Pskov Paratroop Division, 
the copper--somewhere else, and made a fighting attempt to get 
across the border. 
  By the way, many of our current friends who used to be 
enemies conduct intelligence operations from the territories of 
former USSR republics. 
  Apprehending a spy or a foreign intelligence officer is not 
the highest-class work. Foreign intelligence officers are 
arrested in the event of political expediency. In any case, in 
the past this was the only reason. For instance, two of ours are 
expelled from Sweden--intelligence immediately runs to 
counterintelligence: Guys, who do you have in your sights? Our 
pleasure! As many as you need! In the Swedish Embassy alone a 
total of six diplomats. Shall we expel them all together or one 
at a time? A corresponding memorandum goes to the Politburo, 
signed by the KGB chairman. We get the appropriate memorandum 
from Gromyko. Relations with him were very difficult: Gentlemen, 
you are spoiling my peace-loving policy. When Shevardnadze was 
appointed minister of foreign affairs, things became easier. You 
may recall: They expel ours from England--we expel some, too; 
they expel more, we expel more. And on top of that we outwitted 
them, because some wives of British diplomats had diplomatic 
status. Therefore we selected husbands whose wives also were 
diplomats, but expelled only the husbands. As a result they had 
to recall more diplomats. The Americans expelled our people--we 
took away their service personnel: Wash your own dishes. At this 
point the fight was more or less on even ground. So, this is the 
political case. 
  The other case is when the damage is already unavoidable. We 
knew, for instance, in the case of Tolkachev, that he was 
passing over material that would do irreparable damage. This 
means we have to take him. But if we take him, we take the 
American, too. Or, for instance, they take one of ours--we have 
to respond so they will not get away with it. So we take one, 
too. In short, the basic point is that you do this when you can 
no longer play operational games. Because the highest level in 
counterintelligence is operational games. 
  S. Smirnov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special 
correspondent: Do you still use recruitment? 
  S. Bogdanov: We do. 
  S. Smirnov: I mean, through blackmail and... 
  S. Bogdanov: In intelligence or 
counterintelligence? 
  S. Smirnov: Both. 
  S. Bogdanov: All right. Anyway, this goes for both 
intelligence and counterintelligence. When the MB was still 
there, a decision was made in keeping with the law on federal 
organs of state security that we could pay agents. The KGB paid 
agents only in rare instances. And rather small sums. 
  Nevertheless, both we and intelligence can pay. Intelligence 
pays more, though. Still, we never had the kind of money to 
outdo, for instance, the CIA. 
  When I was still going through training, one of our 
still-current intelligence officers shared his experience: 
"Guys, remember, the principle of our work is this (this was his 
personal opinion, one of the methods of recruitment). We look 
for a person who is not doing well, and make it even worse: turn 
him into a spy. Before, he merely embezzled or cheated on his 
wife; we make a spy out of him." Cynicism exists in every line 
of work. 
  The most reliable agents (and this is recognized by all 
intelligence services in the world without exception) are those 
doing it for ideological and political reasons. For a CIA 
officer, for instance, there existed only two compromising 
points for which he could be dismissed from the service: 
homosexuality and drugs. That was all! Ours were recruited, or 
attempts were made to recruit them, on anything: drinking, 
women, video and audio equipment he may have bought somewhere at 
a discount, and so on, and so on. 
  How are things in our counterintelligence? We have no money, 
trust me. Blackmail--on what? Theoretically, we can blackmail a 
person threatening to say that he is our agent. But why would we 
need him after we say this? And recruit him on this? It is 
laughable. 
  O. Blotskiy: Russia has transparent borders with 
practically all states. Can the FCS work effectively in the 
current situation, where any citizen of any contiguous state can 
travel unimpeded wherever he wants? 
  S. Bogdanov: To work effectively, we have to start 
not with borders. What we need is for the state--through the 
president, the Federal Assembly, the Security Council--to tell 
us what the national interests of Russia are and what it is we 
need to protect. 
  Let the president set the task to put an end to organized 
crime. Within what timeframe? Half a year? Ten years? In the 
FRG, for instance, it is considered normal to work on a criminal 
group for five-10 years. Over there, however, both 
counterintelligence and police work on it. But then they take 
the entire group. With accounts in Bolivia, Switzerland, safe 
houses, dead drops, and so on, and so on. 
  We are all worse off because we, in effect, do not have a 
concept of national security--one that is serious and 
comprehensive. [end Bogdanov] 
  Yes, the former KGB has been destroyed... This is the 
truth. But not the whole truth. Read the opinion of Vadim 
Bakatin in an upcoming issue of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Davydov, director of Radio Russia, by </F>
Oleg Moroz, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA columnist; place and date not 
given: "State Radio Cannot Be Apolitical in Today's Russia"] 
  [Text] [Moroz] The first question that is most frequently 
asked by journalists when they meet one another is: How are you 
doing moneywise? So, Sergey Vyacheslavovich, how are things 
going with you at Radio Russia? How are you able to stay afloat? 
It is said that there are plans to cut your appropriations 
sharply. 
  [Davydov] I cannot answer anything about this question 
today. 
It is very frightening. Some figures were mentioned recently--50 
percent of the needed financing, now--32 percent, in my 
opinion... I have simply stopped thinking about it, because this 
is all promises, not money. What are we living on now? On the 
money that we earn. That is earned by the entire television and 
radio company, not only radio. Of course, there is not enough 
money. But you get tired more of the uncertainty... They should 
already have decided exactly how many hours of broadcasting are 
needed. If 22 hours are not needed, like now, but five, then let 
it be five. But these five hours a day must have full financing. 
In exactly the same way, it should be decided clearly how many 
state radio broadcasting channels are required. As is known, 
there are now five of them. 
  [Moroz] Does it not seem to you that radio is dying out, 
being squeezed out by television, and that it is being perceived 
more and more frequently as some kind of half-finished 
product--a phonogram without "pictures?" 
  [Davydov] No, it does not seem that way. I think that radio 
will die when the last cultured person dies. Just what is a 
television "picture?" It is a means of making up for our 
laziness: After hearing some text, we are too lazy to think and 
do some additional imagining of what was heard; and so the task 
is made easier for us, we are given an image. Therefore, in 
particular, television theater and radio theater are completely 
different things. And radio theater is the same kind of cultural 
possession as television theater. Like the drama theater. What 
is more, there are after all genre theater and purely radio 
theater. For example, literary readings. There is a special 
radio audience. The blind, invalids... In addition, I suspect 
that today the number of radio listeners is growing. Imagine the 
television set breaking down; it is very expensive to repair 
now, so a person is limited to the radio set... Of course, 
radio, as well as television, is experiencing elements of a 
crisis, but it seems to me that the crisis in radio--in a 
cultural sense--is not that severe. 
  [Moroz] In what, nonetheless, do you see this crisis? 
  [Davydov] In many things. In particular, the departure of 
announcers of the old school and the arrival of journalists at 
the microphone has reduced the level of broadcasting culture 
somewhat. Errors have become more frequent... 
  [Moroz] You understand, of course, that I asked the question 
about the possible death of radio exclusively for the sake of 
sharpening the conversation, and in order to provoke your 
professional pride. Nonetheless, do radio journalists not have a 
feeling of decline and second-grade status in comparison with 
television workers? After all, the whole country knows those who 
are on the air continuously. A person could be a rather average 
journalist, but the feeling is such that this is a dominant 
influence. Briefly, it is more prestigious to work in television 
than in radio. In such a case, do you not suffer from turncoats? 
  [Davydov] The idea of the second-grade status of radio in 
comparison with television exists more outside the professional 
environment of radio journalists. We have had people who moved 
over to television, but not that many. Isolated cases. And they 
are journalists who did not become professionals in radio. A 
person who has worked in radio for a dozen or so years, as a 
rule, no longer aspires to television. He understands that radio 
is ANOTHER type of journalism, another type of art. It is like 
moving from opera to ballet. After all, there are opera and 
ballet theaters, and these seem to be close things. Close, but 
not very. But the attitude of the state and society toward radio 
really is like toward something secondary. It is remembered as a 
last resort, in periods of putsches and right after them, when 
television has distinctly exhausted its resources. At that time 
a stream of high-standing visitors rushes to us. They are all 
amazed at what squalor we live in and antiquated equipment we 
have, and they promise us the moon, but, naturally, as soon as 
the crisis situation passes they forget about their promises. 
  [Moroz] What do you consider the framework of your radio day 
to be? What are its pivotal programs. And what are the main 
ideas that you put into your broadcasting? 
  [Davydov] Of course, hourly information releases constitute 
the framework. It not we who make them--they are made by the 
Radio Russia information service. But this is the framework. 
Then we create our fillers. Firstly, the morning programs. 
Basically, journal and musical. Then there are the daily 
programs. These are children's and do-it-yourself programs. 
"Interlocutor" left us for Radio 1, and the "Home Academy" 
do-it-yourself program appeared. How to build a house, how to 
keep house, how to feed the family... The need for such programs 
is being felt more and more now. Politics is already starting to 
get boring. The "Author's Channel 'From the First Person'" grew 
out of the five hours of our first underground political 
broadcasting in 1990-1991. This is our main political 
program. Its title speaks for itself. This is an authors' radio, 
if you wish. After 1800 a block starts that, perhaps, is dearest 
to me--I hope employees who work on other programs are not 
offended by me--the artistic broadcasting block. Here even 
social and political journalism is done with a nuance of art. 
And at 2220 the purely hip youth program "Four Fourths" starts. 
It continues until 0200. It, of course, has its own problems, 
but the main thing is that there was nothing like this on radio. 
Although many of us grew up on the radio station Youth. 
  Frankly, when this program started up, there was 
resistance--and tremendous resistance--from a number of 
listeners and a listlessly intelligent resistance on the part of 
the management of the company. But the young people, 
nonetheless, showed that there should be such a youth program. 
We still do not use it as an element of political propaganda, 
but I fear that it will be necessary to use it in this capacity 
as well: The mood among youth is an important factor in politics. 
  [Moroz] What is the balance here between serious and 
entertainment programs, between culture and popular culture, for 
which you are striving in your broadcasting? 
  [Davydov] Popular culture and entertainment is now 
concentrated here mainly, perhaps, in the "Four Fourths" program 
that I mentioned. There are also elements of entertainment in 
the morning program "The Beginning," although I would not call 
it entertaining. This year we changed the approach to thematic 
programs somewhat. They still were somewhat heavy. We cut their 
time to 15-20 minutes. And we expanded the musical flow of 
sound. Mainly at the expense of classical music and 
retrospective reviews. Moreover, it became clear that we hit the 
nail on the head here. There is a strong nostalgia in our 
society with respect to the 1960's and 1970's. It is also happy 
with retrospective music. But the classics are classics. The 
need for the eternal and imperishable is always alive among 
people. It is a number one problem for us--nothing to laugh at. 
  So-called humorous programs have appeared here this year, 
but 
there is no particular response to them yet. And there is a 
problem with game programs. We have, perhaps, only one game 
program--"VZV" (Evening Amusement for Adults), which is done by 
Leonid Azarkh. It is necessary to play on radio. Radio games 
exist in the whole world. 
  As I have already said, we concentrate politics in four 
hours 
on the "Authors' Channel." And this is probably the optimal 
variant. 
  [Moroz] Do you know what kind of audience you have? 
  [Davydov] Of course, we know, although, perhaps, not in 
great 
detail. Any kind of sociological poll is now too expensive. This 
audience is very broad and mixed... And rather conservative. 
Russia is a conservative country in general. This is not my 
observation and not my discovery. As one of my colleagues said, 
Moscow is not Russia, Moscow is Moscow, an entirely different 
country starts beyond the ring road. But it is mainly Muscovites 
who work for us, and they are young people as well. They do not 
always understand that beyond the bounds of the capital there is 
a very different country. So that we do not have 100 percent 
confidence that we know our listeners. 
  [Moroz] To what extent do you depend on listeners? 
  [Davydov] Unfortunately, to no extent. The other day there 
was a funny telegram: The main production line of the AZLK 
[Moscow Leninist Komsomol Automobile Plant] was shut down as a 
sign of protest against discrimination with respect to the 
program "Interlocutor" (this program is now transmitted on the 
third channel). Well, where else can a production line of a very 
large automobile plant shut down as a result of the fact that a 
program ceased to exist on one channel and switched to another? 
But imagine what it would entail if such a thing happened 
somewhere else suddenly--let us say, the FIAT plant in Italy 
came to a stop, because of some perturbations on radio? At a 
minimum there would be parliamentary hearings. But in our 
country--nothing. Even such serious threats do not influence us 
in any way. In the meantime, dependence on listeners, perhaps, 
is exactly what would save us in the economic situation in which 
we find ourselves. If it were financial. But today, whether we 
pay for a radio point or not, whether we pay taxes or not, this 
has no effect at all on the work of the radio. Everything is 
dissolved in the common pot, it is depersonalized... 
  [Moroz] How do you differ from other radio channels? From 
Mayak it is clear, but, let us say, from Radio 1? 
  [Davydov] Our difference not only from Mayak but also from 
Youth and Orpheus is clear. But as for Radio 1, we have a 
significant similarity. The fact that we started to broadcast on 
the "first button" compelled us to arrange our broadcasting with 
a view to the first all-Union program. Our main difference from 
this channel is, perhaps, that we are a younger and more mobile 
radio. And now we have become even more dynamic--in connection 
with program timing and the expansion of musical elements, about 
which I have already talked. 
  [Moroz] As a result of the departure of "Interlocutor" from 
your wavelengths, people were prepared to bring the automobile 
plant to a halt. But "Interlocutor" is not your program... 
  [Davydov] Yes, it was accommodated on our wavelengths in a 
contract with Ostankino. This contract ended in 1993. 
  [Moroz]...But do you have your own programs that are just as 
popular, that are liked as much by the people, and whose 
cancellation or switch to another wavelength would cause such a 
powerful listener protest? 
  [Davydov] I am afraid of such a definition "liked by the 
people": Each program has its listeners. There are programs that 
are simply destined for success. No matter how they were made. 
Take, for example, the program "An old gramophone reminded 
me..." Or "A meeting with a song." I can simply sit, read 
letters, and play songs that people request. And it will meet 
with success. I do not want to diminish the role of those who 
produce these programs, but I repeat, they are destined for 
success. Or, for example, "Home Academy." Four young female 
employees "cover" five hours of air time in a week. They are 
real heroines, and a monument should be erected to them. But if 
I simply sat an announcer down who would read how to boil 
buckwheat, how to bring up a child...the program would be 
popular all the same. But there are programs of another 
kind--let us assume "Roots and Branches," which deals with the 
fates of a classic legacy in contemporary life. People appear in 
it of such a level as Yuriy Mikhailovich Lotman and Dmitryy 
Sergeyevich Likhachev. I cannot call it popular. But this 
program also established the face of the channel. Or we have the 
young radio journalist Sasha Korshunov--a fellow who digs into 
history. Moreover, who finds in it not cheap sensations but 
exposes many of its pages anew. There also was never a big 
stream of letters on its broadcast, and no production line will 
stop for the sake of it, but it has its listeners. This is also 
our face. 
  [Moroz] What can you say about the innovations in recent 
years--the widespread use of going live on the air, telephone 
participation of radio listeners in broadcasts, and so forth? Do 
they not lower the quality of broadcasting? 
  [Davydov] We went through a stage of being infatuated with 
listener telephone calls, while still working on the youth 
channel of radio station Youth, and in the first period of 
activity of Radio Russia. We very rarely resort to this now. 
Telephone communications with listeners occurs with us, as a 
rule, somewhat differently: We simply provide an open line 
telephone, next to which our invited guest sits for an hour to 
an hour and a half. But starting on 9 March a permanent open 
line telephone has been working on Radio Russia--in the 
reception room. Listeners can call it up from 1400 to 1800 
during the day, Moscow time. But now local stations usually put 
listeners who call on the telephone on live broadcasts: This 
way, people bring their troubles and their problems to the 
attention of local officials. As for our live broadcasting, it 
takes up 10 of our 22 hours every day. In broadcasting to the 
European zone. The ratio is different in rebroadcasts. Here 
there are two sides. It is bad that it is impossible to correct 
anything. What is said is what is heard. But it is impossible to 
work without live broadcasting today. The situation in the 
country is changing rapidly. If only recording is used, you 
cannot keep up with this situation. 
  [Moroz] The other day corresponding member of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences Khasbulatov who was released from prison 
said in one of his numerous interviews that the most trying 
experience in the prison cell was Mayak and Radio Russia, which 
were continuously broadcasting a stream of lies. According to 
him, it is necessary to have a powerful brain in order to come 
up with so much lying. He also said that one radio station was 
enough "to beat one's brains"--true, this was only said about 
Mayak. What do you think about this? 
  [Davydov] In principle, I can limit myself to one phrase: We 
have not lost one court case to date. 
  [Moroz] Have there been many trials? 
  [Davydov] One or two are always going on. So, let 
Khasbulatov 
go to court, and we will figure out who lied where. 
  [Moroz] I think the scientist had in mind not lies in a 
literal sense, but Radio Russia's political orientation. 
  [Davydov] In that case, things have to be called by their 
correct names. If, while carrying out a certain political 
policy, we are also not sinning against the truth, our opponent 
may himself answer for slander. However, we will not begin, of 
course, to expend either the time or the money on such a court 
examination. 
  [Moroz] But you do not intend to change your political 
orientation? After all, many are changing it now... 
  [Davydov] You see, I am frequently told: "State radio should 
be apolitical." I reply: "Yes, in a normal society." Radio 
Russia was planned as a political radio "under Yeltsin." Well, I 
am a person who is more or less apolitical--it was simply 
interesting to me to make a new channel out of nothing. And 
journalists came here mainly out of political considerations. 
But when in the middle of 1992 a struggle of the two authorities 
began, we tried to maintain an objective approach. Deputies 
themselves commented here on everything that was happening. 
Aksyuchits did not scramble out of our radio. I am not now 
talking about broadcasting the meetings of the Supreme Soviet. 
Then the political fight intensified. It seemed to the Supreme 
Soviet that it was getting little air time. The idea came up for 
a "Parliamentary Hour." I tried to show that the appearance of 
this program would throw Radio Russia sharply into another, 
opposite direction. I was not listened to. From the very first 
minutes of the existence of the "Parliamentary Hour," streams of 
abuse came down on the president. And we were compelled to 
defend him. Today, of course, the situation is different, but 
the political struggle continues. The fate of the country 
depends on its outcome. But for this reason I will say once 
more, Radio Russia, like all state radio, cannot allow itself to 
be apolitical. Although, of course, we strive to present all 
viewpoints that exist in society.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhan Toshchenko: "Potentially Dangerous Points; </F>
The Ethnopolitical Situation in Russia in 1993"] 
  [Text] In characterizing the ethnopolitical situation, we 
proceed from the fact that at the present time the national 
ideal has become basic in the process of implementing various 
types of sovereignization, and it is being used in the struggle 
for power, for ownership, and for regional privileges. 
  The specifics of the period which we are experiencing are 
such that under current conditions the primary threat to 
Russia's national security stems not so much from foreign 
sources as from various destructive forces within the country. 
Among the most dangerous factors, along with the prolonged and 
deep economic and social crisis, we must cite also the crisis of 
national policy of the state as a whole. 
  The absence of a unified conception of national policy in 
essence has made it impossible to localize even one of the 
inter-ethnic conflicts arising during the period of 
disintegration of the USSR as well as after it, to expose the 
main reasons for their emergence, and to develop a mechanism for 
early prevention and effective reaction to crisis situations. 
<H6>  The State of Interethnic Accord and Possible Prospects for 
Its Development </H6>
  A rather high level of inter-ethnic tensions continued to be 
retained in 1993. Experimental studies and an analysis of the 
conflicts allow us to conclude that at the present time there 
are three levels of tension in inter-ethnic relations. 
  The first of these--ethnic limitation (i.e., the 
unwillingness to opt for contacts beyond the boundaries of one's 
ethnic group)--is the most widespread. It is manifested in 
increased interest toward creation of mono-national families 
(there is a reduction in the relative share of mixed marriages), 
in a preference to work in mono-national collectives, and in the 
monopolization of leadership positions of all levels by 
representatives of one's own people. 
  Practically each of the peoples, especially those which have 
a national-state or national-territorial autonomy, is gripped 
with this illness, which is the initial and primary basis for 
disintegration of interethnic accord. 
  The second level--ethnic egoism (the desire to ensure 
advantages for one's own people at the expense of others)--is 
becoming ever more widespread. 
  Up to 30-40 percent of the native population of the 
republics 
believes that it is natural for them to get advantages over 
other peoples populating this republic. It has become almost the 
rule that the employment of Russians exceeds their relative 
share in the population only in industry and partially in 
science, public health and education. In all other spheres and 
sectors, including the organs of state and economic 
administration and the make-up of the student population, the 
relative share of Russians is lower than their specific share in 
the make-up of the population. In Tatariya, for example, there 
is a de facto introduction of strict limitations by national 
indicator on the ownership and management of natural resources. 
Russian joint-stock holders are being edged out, and the 
representatives of the Tatar people are gaining the controlling 
packets of stock, etc. 
  In Dagestan, ethnic egoism is manifested in the hidden 
opposition of the Laktsy and the Kumyks (because of Kumyk 
lands), and in the desire by the Nogay to achieve unification of 
Nogay territories which are currently divided up between 
Dagestan, Stavropol Kray and Chechnya. 
  Ethnic egoism may go into the third stage--ethnophobism, 
which is characterized by open enmity and irreconcilability in 
regard to other people who are "foreign" and "not one's own." 
This has been particularly manifested in the well-known 
Ossetin-Ingush conflict, when the fires of hatred, 
nonrecognition and mutual accusations continue to rage on an 
interpersonal level. 
  Individual regions of the Cossack brotherhood and certain 
rayons of the North Caucasus stand on the brink of open 
opposition to the interests of various peoples. 
  However, the level of acuteness in national relations has 
become stabilized. While undoubtedly being exceedingly high, it 
has nevertheless been retained within the framework of 1992 
indicators. As compared with a year ago, the mass consciousness 
of the native population is somewhat less taken with the ideas 
of national separatism and unification of one's ethnic groups 
presently living on other territories into a single state 
formation. 
<H6>  Ethnopolitical Movements, Organizations and Parties </H6>
  Their growth in 1993 continued. There was an increasing 
number of associations and organizations based on the principles 
of national rebirth and self-preservation. Their organizational 
consolidation continued, and in some of them the extremist wing 
grew stronger. Their actions led to a forced decision on the 
rates and content of sovereignization. Part of the national 
associations strived to become parallel organs of power, to 
replace the state structures. Efforts were made to create 
militarized formations. In a number of republics (Komi, for 
example), they were granted the right of legislative initiative, 
as well as the actual right to conduct expert evaluation of 
drafts of legislative decisions. 
  Many of them became the bearers of new consolidating 
principles, appealing not to the political consciousness of the 
citizens, but to the historical, ethnic, and ethnosocial, i.e., 
to more universal interests than, for example, class or group 
interests. 
  And although more significant differences were manifested in 
1993 than before, differences between positions of titular 
peoples and their "representative" national parties and 
movements (extremist nationalist demands were supported by 10-15 
percent of the native population, with an alarm indicator of 7-8 
percent), we cannot underestimate their negative influence. 
  Thus, the activity of the All-Osset Council "Styr 
Nakhas" and the socio-political association "Our Ossetiya" 
not only intensifies the Osset-Ingush conflict, but also 
facilitates the emergence of anti-Russian and anti-military 
sentiments among the Osset people. 
  In the second half of 1993 there was a sharp increase in the 
propaganda of nationalist ideas in the Republic of Dagestan by 
the socio-political movements "Tenglik," "Birlik," and 
"People's Front imeni Shamil," whose leaders call for the 
struggle against the colonial policy of Russia in the North 
Caucasus as one of the conditions for prosperity of the nations. 
  The Lezghin people's movement Sadval" promotes in 
its activity the idea of forming a "Unified Lezghistan," which 
leads to the violation of the territorial integrity of Russia 
and Azerbaijan. 
  The activity of the Komi national party "Doryams 
AsnyMES" ("We Will Defend Ourselves") has a notably 
expressed nationalistic and anti-Russian position. 
  The Buryat-Mongol People's Party promotes the idea 
of unifying all Mongols with an orientation toward Mongolia. 
  The "Union of the Banished", the "Eastern Prussia" 
association of fellow countrymen and other organizations of 
an extremist ilk in Kaliningrad Oblast have set for themselves 
the goal of creating a powerful German community by means of 
implementing broad economic cooperation with Germany, which may 
also evoke negative consequences. 
  The Party for Chuvash Rebirth and the 
Chuvash National Congress are expanding contacts with 
representatives of Turkish religious centers for the purpose of 
spreading the principles of Islam and gradually edging out 
Christianity, which may cause friction between the adherents of 
different religious confessions. 
  A particularly destabilizing factor in inter-ethnic 
relations 
is the presence or creation of possible military or militarized 
formations. In the Chechen Republic there are subdivisions of 
the regular army in various stages of formulation. Among these 
are a mountain-infantry brigade, tank and artillery regiments, a 
border brigade, and a special purpose regiment. Within the 
make-up of the ChR [Chechen Republic] national guard there is a 
regiment of the national guard, a Muslim fighting regiment, and 
an "Abkhaz batallion." Detachments of the people's militia are 
being created or have already been created in each population 
center, based on territorial principle. 
  In North Ossetia there are also measures being implemented 
on 
the formation of a future national army, the nucleus of which is 
the Administration for Defense of Facilities of the National 
Economy. At the end of 1993, its ranks numbered up to 7,000 
persons and around 100 units of armored equipment. 
  The overall number of personnel of various military 
formations in Ingushetia is in excess of 2,500 people. 
  And finally, the emergence (retention) of interethnic 
tensions, work on regulating conflict situations which is long 
in its duration and ineffective in its content and, on the 
contrary, a stable situation in multinational regions largely 
depends on the opposition of the national-political elite. The 
conceptions of national statehood and national sovereignty of 
individual national-state formations often conceal the political 
ambitions of the ethnic elite, and efforts to translate their 
slogans into the language of practical actions end in human 
tragedies. 
  At the same time, the danger of ethnopolitical organizations 
for the present time is most likely exaggerated (perhaps with 
the exception of Tatarstan and, in part, Dagestan). They are for 
the ruling national elite sooner a means of trade with Moscow 
than a real opposition. The pressure of national organizations 
on the leaders of republics will evidently continue, but its 
effectiveness will be determined in the nearest time by the will 
of the national majority--the people, and not by the degree of 
pressure exerted by the extremist part of the national parties 
and movements. 
<H6>  Refugees and Forced Migrants </H6>
  1993 was a year of gradual transition of almost all parties 
to a more precise definition of their positions in regard to 
Russians in the "near abroad" countries. Out of a total of 26 
million people who found themselves abroad in the Spring of 
1991, 2 million have already returned to Russia. According to 
official statistical data, in 1990-1992, one-fourth of the 
Russians left Tajikistan and Azerbaijan, and 17 percent left 
Georgia. Central Asia and the Transcaucasus gave up 2/3 of the 
repatriates (although only 16 percent of the Russians located in 
the near abroad countries live there). 
  On the whole, the return of a total of 6 million people is 
expected. 
  The complexity of solving the problems of Russian refugees 
(in the political plane) consists of the fact that they 
represent a dynamic, active and explosive group under conditions 
of Russia, inclined to support nationalist forces and 
nationalist organizations. 
  At the same time, this is the most skilled, the most 
organized and creative part of the Russians living abroad, which 
by its knowledge, experience and skill is capable of 
successfully resolving economic and social problems and actively 
aiding the new Russia. 
<H6>  Migration of the Population </H6>
  Along with the continuation of emigration of the Russian and 
Russian-speaking population, there has been a significant 
increase in the influx of people of other nationalities who have 
left their native land as a result of economic and political 
instability in their regions, as well as inter-clan and 
inter-tribal clashes under the threat of physical and moral 
annihilation. 
  An operative analysis of the flow of migrants to Kaluga 
Oblast shows that, along with Russian refugees, a significant 
portion is comprised of forced migrants from Moldova, Armenia, 
Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, and the republics of the Northern 
Caucasus. Aside from the difficulties of integrating into a 
foreign-speaking environment, this situation bears 
contradictions which are difficult to resolve: 
  --the urban population predominates within the influx of 
refugees and migrants, while Kaluga oblast (like most of the 
Russian oblasts) primarily offers them employment involving farm 
labor; 
  --among the refugees and migrants there is a very high 
relative share of the intelligentsia, which in a certain sense 
hinders its employment due to lack of correspondence of skills 
to available jobs, or due to saturation of traditional 
professions. 
  We should also note that the influx of the foreign-speaking 
population to the territory of Russia will increase, because 
along with the political reasons there is an increase in the 
significance of socio-economic ones: Growing unemployment (lack 
of jobs), especially for young people, as well as problems of 
water and land. 
  The lack of resolution of the newly emerging problem--the 
foreign-speaking population among the native Russian 
population--requires increased attention in 1994 in order to 
prevent the emergence of ethnic tensions and conflicts in the 
central part of Russia. 
<H6>  Sore Spots in Interethnic Relations </H6>
  The retained tendencies toward intensification of regional 
separatism, the expansion of interethnic conflicts, the 
aspirations of the national elite toward re-division of the 
territories and toward greater sovereignty, and the struggle for 
power all pose a threat to the territorial integrity of the 
country and Russian statehood in general. 
  The direct sources of real threats in the sphere of 
interethnic relations are: Efforts to form enclaves according to 
the ethnic principle on the territory of the Russian Federation; 
intensification of socioeconomic inequality of various peoples 
and ethnic groups; increase in ethnic migrations, migration of 
refugees and forced migrants; mass violations of civil rights 
and freedoms in individual regions. 
  By indicator of conflict, all the sore spots in Russia may 
be 
classified by the following principles: 
  --zones of acute crisis (military conflicts or balancing on 
their brink); 
  --potential crisis situations; 
  --zones of strong regional separatism; 
  --zones of moderate regional separatism; 
  --zones of weakly expressed separatism. 
  We will deal primarily with the "painful", crisis zones. 
<H6>  Regions of Acute Crisis Situations </H6>
  The most explosive remains the situation in the zone of 
North 
Ossetia and Ingushetiya. After the trip by the Russian 
Federation President to the zone of conflict and the 13 December 
1993 edict on the procedure for returning refugees and forced 
migrants to Digaron, Chermen, Kurtat and Dachnoye, the tensions 
have not declined, but continue to increase. 
  Despite the positive evaluation expressed by officials of 
these republics regarding the results of the achieved accord, 
there is, nevertheless, an expression of apprehension that 
extremist forces will make use of the situation and will push 
the Ingush toward elemental resettlement to the indicated 
population centers, the negative consequences of which are 
unpredictable. 
  Meetings of extremist directionality have been held in North 
Ossetia, organized by the opposition. The session of the North 
Ossetia Supreme Soviet refused to rescind its previous decision 
on the impossibility of Ingush and Osset living together. The 
information spread by extremists regarding the forceful 
provision of Ingush resettlement to places of their former 
residence once again intensifies the mutual enmity. 
  Negotiations within the framework of the mixed commission 
have been suspended. Efforts by the temporary administration to 
put the factors of "people's diplomacy" into action have not 
yielded positive results. 
  In order to reduce tensions in this region, it seems 
expedient to implement a series of successive measures. First of 
all, to tie in the solution of the problem of refugees not with 
the territorial aspirations of the Ingush and Osset, but with 
the creation of opportunities for each people for realization of 
their rights to national self-sufficiency. 
  Secondly, stricter measures are needed for disarmament of 
the 
military formations created in Ingushetiya and North Ossetia 
after the armed conflict. 
  Thirdly, it seems expedient to more effectively utilize the 
additional financing of Ingushetiya and North Ossetia, to 
establish strict control over the expenditure of financial means 
allocated for target programs. 
  Fourthly, it has long been time to give a public legal and 
political evaluation of the events of October-November 1992 and 
to name the names of the organizers and participants in the 
criminal actions. 
  Fifth, it is necessary to change over from a 
military-administrative form of administration to a direct 
federal form of administration and to repeal the state of 
martial law. 
  Another point which personifies the acute crisis situation 
is 
Chechnya and the indeterminacy of its status, as well as the 
separatist policy of its current leadership. The approaches to 
the problem of Chechnya as defined at the conference in Nalchik 
on 7 December 1993 do not have favorable prospects. Moreover, 
the closure of the border with the Chechen Republic along its 
entire perimeter, including the undefined line of administrative 
division with Ingushetiya, may lead to an exacerbation of the 
situation in the region and to provocation of anti-Russian 
sentiments. A mild course toward keeping Chechnya within the 
make-up of Russia, juridically and economically, seems more 
preferable. The interests of stabilization of the situation in 
the region and reduction in the criminal situation in Chechnya 
would be served by efforts of the leadership of Dagestan and 
Stavropol to conclude bilateral agreements with the regime of D. 
Dudayev regarding cooperation in resolution of socio-economic 
questions and provision of human rights. At the same time, it 
would be expedient to continue contacts with the opposition to 
D. Dudayev's regime, and to support the social base of the 
opposition. This course is desirable also because the Chechen 
diaspora in the nearby and distant foreign countries is 
beginning to speak out against the regime of D. Dudayev. 
  It would be expedient to involve such influential movements 
as the Conference of Peoples of the Caucasus and the Tersk 
Cossack Brotherhood in the regulation of problems of a crisis 
character in the North Caucasus. 
<H6>  Potential Acute Crisis Situations </H6>
  Among these we must cite primarily the tense ethnopolitical 
situation taking shape in the Republic of Tyva (Tuva). Beginning 
in 1990, the separatist course of the People's Front of Tuva 
provoked the mass departure of the Russian-speaking population. 
Tensions are being increased by the actions of organizations of 
former prisoners, particularly by the mass "seizure" of the 
vacated apartments of refugees. 
  On the wave of increased nationalism, increase in crime, and 
decline in productivity, the Supreme Soviet of Tuva adopted a 
new constitution in November of 1993. The first article of this 
constitution calls the republic a sovereign state within the 
make-up of Russia, having the right to full self-determination 
by means of an all-people's referendum. At the same time (29 
November of this year), the Supreme Soviet of Tuva adopted a 
decree on holding a referendum on the question of Tuva remaining 
in the Russian Federation. 
  Considering the fact that Tuva was included in the make-up 
of 
the USSR only in 1944 and that Tuvins comprise the overwhelming 
majority in the republic (around 65 percent), the probability of 
its separation from Russia in the next few years is very great. 
The population of Tuva is largely comprised of lamaists of the 
Mongol doctrine and is culturally oriented toward its former 
suzerain--the Mongol state. Unemployment and a high crime rate 
facilitate the increase in anti-Russian demonstrations, which 
are not opposed by the official authorities. 
  The second zone of potential acute conflict is Krasnodar 
Kray, which has become multi-national. Analysis shows that it is 
among the regions which are most explosive in a national sense. 
The concentration of situations generating conflict has long 
been prevalent here, but especially since the late 1980's, and 
continues to the present time. 
  The causes of such situations which arise in the kray are 
varied. One of the reasons is concealed in the multi-nationality 
of the kray, where along with the 4-million Russian population 
there are representatives of 22 peoples, including Ukrainians, 
Armenians, Adygey, Greeks, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Meskhetin 
Turks and others. Most live compactly and represent groups which 
are ethnically rather cohesive, retaining their native language 
and traditions. 
  The second factor giving rise to inter-ethnic conflicts in 
the kray is associated with migration, primarily forced 
migration, and the influx of refugees which was facilitated by 
the disintegration of the Union, the inter-ethnic conflicts, the 
exacerbation of socio-economic and national situation in a 
number of regions. The changed geopolitical position of 
Krasnodar Kray evoked a new wave of migrations. It became a 
border region of Russia. 
  The migration processes in Krasnodar Kray occurred in the 
1970's-1980's. Crimean Tatars, Meskhetin Turks and Kurds moved 
here. A new wave of influx of Meskhetins was caused by the 
events of 1989 in Fergan. The influx of Armenians into Krasnodar 
Kray increased in connection with the earthquake in Armenia in 
1988, and was later spurred by the flare-up of genocide in 
Sumgait and Baku and the war in Karabakh. The Abkhazo-Georgian 
War gave a new impetus to forced migrations--of Russian, 
Armenian and other refugees from Abkhaziya. 
  The dynamics of refugees in Krasnodar Kray is such: The 
first 
half of 1991--32,000 persons; October 1991--38,500; January 
1992--54,000; April 1992--53,000; June 1992--58,500. In 1993 the 
flow of refugees increased even more. By nationality, the 
refugees were distributed as follows: Russians and 
Russian-speaking peoples--27,000; Armenians--over 16,000; 
Meskhetin Turks--around 13,500, and Azerbaijanis--1,500. 
  The influx of refugees and forced emigrants is continually 
complicating the situation in the kray. Part of them are not 
registered, and therefore cannot be employed. Inter-ethnic 
relations between the Russians and the Armenians, the Cossacks 
and the other population, the Adygeys and the Russians have 
become particularly acute. In recent times there have been 
repeated demands for the deportation of the Armenians and the 
Meskhetin Turks. There are frequent cases of deportation of new 
settlers from the kray. According to a sociological survey 
conducted among the local deputies, the conflict situation in 
the kray may intensify, since 60 percent of the population 
(throughout Russia it is 20-25 percent) believes there is a 
possibility of open conflict between individual national groups. 
  The third potentially dangerous point may become the 
Republic 
of Dagestan. Although on the whole it has been possible to keep 
the situation under control there, the probability of a 
breakdown and violation of relative ethnopolitical stability and 
inter-ethnic accord is great. 
  A zone of increased conflict is the region settled by the 
Chechen-Akkin, the once liquidated Aukhovskiy Rayon. The 
authorities have been able to find a compromise decision which 
satisfies the Chechen (their rayon is being restored) and the 
Laktsy and Avartsy who are living here, and who are now being 
relocated to new lands next to the Kumyk. On the other hand, 
sentiments are increasing among the Kumyk against the occupation 
of the "Kumyk lands" by the Laktsy. As the settlement continues, 
the prospect of a conflict with the local Kumyk population 
becomes rather probable. 
  Another notable point of inter-ethnic opposition in Dagestan 
is the situation in the south of the republic, where the Lezghin 
popular movement "Sadval" actively speaks out for the 
preservation of the ethno-cultural and ethno-political unity of 
the two parts of the Lezghin ethnos, currently separated by the 
borders of the RF [Russian Federation] and Azerbaijan (there are 
over 170,000 Lezghin living in Azerbaijan, and over 75,000 
Azerbaijanis living in Dagestan). The formulation of the 
boundary in this region may evoke sharp exacerbation of the 
situation and lead to conflict. 
  Of the other points of inter-ethnic tensions, one that 
requires particular attention is the Kumyk problem, which 
consists of the desire by part of the Kumyk population for 
administrative separation of their ethnic territory, as well as 
the Nogay problem, which reflects the intentions of the Nogay 
people to achieve unification of all Nogay territories which are 
currently divided between Dagestan, Stavropol Kray and Chechnya. 
<H6>  Regions (zones) of Strong Separatism </H6>
  The Republic of Tatarstan occupies a peculiar place in the 
ethnopolitical situation. The republic is located in the center 
of the Russian Federation, and its population is almost half 
comprised of Russians (43.3 percent). The most numerous and 
influential national parties agitate for secession from the 
Russian Federation and acknowledgement of equal rights for 
Tatarstan. It is possible to preserve peace in Tatarstan because 
the current leaders of Tatarstan are among the proponents of 
Tatarstan independence who are gravitating toward gradual 
disunification with Russia. 
  Slogans about Turkic unity are becoming ever more popular, 
although on the whole the idea of creating a parliament of the 
entire Tatar people, presented at the 1st All-Tatar Congress in 
February of 1992 by the newly formed Milli Medjlis (people's 
parliament), did not find deep-seated support in society. The 
appearance of the Milli Medjlis changed the placement of 
political forces: An organ emerged which was an alternative to 
the official parliament. In the case of a political crisis in 
the Republic of Tatarstan, we cannot exclude the possibility 
that the Milli Medjlis may be changed into some semblance of an 
all-national congress and that there will be a changeover by 
members of the Milli Medjlis to extremely strict positions in 
regard to the existing organs of power. A confirmation of this 
is the joint announcement, in which the only lawful organ of 
power of the Tatar people is acknowledged to be the Milli 
Medjlis, and which contains an appeal for cohesion of the Tatar 
people under its flag. 
  In the last two years there has been a radical 
re-distribution of power and prestigious positions in favor of 
the Tatars: 70-80 percent of all heads of administration and 
chairmen of rayon soviets, rayon procurators, chairmen of rayon 
courts, leaders of the RUVD [rayon internal affairs 
administrations] and chief physicians. Nevertheless, the 
leadership of Tatarstan stands on the positions of preserving 
ties with Russia and conducting civilized negotiations with 
Moscow on all important questions, especially on problems of 
handing over the rights and authorities of the federation 
subject to the center.* 
<H6>  Regions of Moderate Regional Separatism </H6>
  The political situation in the Republic of Komi is becoming 
more complicated. The organization "Komi kotyr" created in 
January of 1991, which speaks out as the initiator of 
consolidation of the Komi national movement, has formed a 
permanent organ--the Committee for Rebirth of the Komi People. 
The active work of this committee in the republic and close 
cooperation with analogous organizations of Finno-Ugric peoples 
have significantly increased the prestige of the Committee for 
Rebirth of the Komi People and its influence on the 
ethnopolitical situation in the republic. 
  We must note that, within the Komi national movement, a 
tendency has emerged toward merging of the Committee for Rebirth 
of the Komi People with the constitutional system of power, 
turning it into an organ representing the Komi people on the 
foreign economic arena. At the demand of the Second Congress of 
the Komi People (December 1992), the Republic of Komi Supreme 
Soviet adopted a law on granting the congresses of the Komi 
national movement the right of legislative initiative. 
  The Third Congress of the Komi People (December 1993) 
demanded that an article be included in the republic's 
constitution stating that Komi is a sovereign republic, with the 
right of secession from the make-up of the RF. Demands were also 
presented regarding the return to the Republic of Komi of five 
rayons which had "previously been handed over" to the make-up of 
Arkhangelsk Oblast. 
  We must stress that the Committee for Rebirth of the Komi 
People is trying to establish control over the power structures 
of the republic and, relying on the support of Estonia, to take 
a course toward national self-determination. 
  We may also relate the situations which have arisen in 
Yakutiya, Kalmykiya, and Gorny Altay to the zones of moderate 
separatism. Despite the assurances by the republic leadership 
that they have no intention of seceding from Russia, already 
today the line of their legislative and executive organs of 
power toward treaty, and not constitutional, relations with the 
Russian center is becoming quite evident. This in fact leads, at 
best, to the establishment of a specific form of confederative 
relations. 
  And finally, we should note the group of regions with the 
lowest level of inter-ethnic tensions. These include the 
territories populated by the minor peoples of the European 
north, Siberia and the Far East, a number of republics in 
Povolzhye, Kareliya, specifically "Russian" krays and oblasts, 
as well as regions of compact settlement of peoples who do not 
have national statehood or autonomy (Veps, Izhor, Greeks, 
Koreans, Tofalars, etc.). 
<H6>  Prognosis for 1994 </H6>
  New conflicts of a violent character over a large part of 
the 
territory of Russia are improbable in 1994, although in the 
North Caucasus and in Dagestan the conflict potential is more 
significant than in other regions. 
  On the whole, 1994 will not be a year of opposition by 
specifically national groups or confessions. It will be a year 
of "war" of the federal and national-republic structures over 
the division of statehood, property and authority, over 
questions of citizenship, the state language, and especially 
questions regarding the sale (or redistribution) of land. 
  At the same time, the following problems will become objects 
of political discussions and speculations, and may exacerbate 
and undermine inter-ethnic accord. 
<H6>  The Russian Republic </H6>
  A number of social movements and political parties are 
actively promoting the idea of the possibility of creating a 
Russian Republic in Russia, based on the fact that Russians do 
not have statehood, despite the fact that they are the most 
numerous ethnic group. Russia is characterized as a federation 
without Russians, and in this connection the task of struggling 
for the creation of a single unitarian Russian state on the 
territory of Russia is presented. For the present, this demand 
does not yet find support in the mass consciousness. However, we 
cannot exclude the possibility of an increase in the number of 
its supporters. 
  The very idea, naturally, increases the status of Russians 
in 
Russia, but the creation of a Russian Republic would lead to an 
actual dismantling of the RF and a disintegration of Russia. 
<H6>  Russian Nationalism </H6>
  There is a real danger that the Russian national ideal will 
grow into a militant force, into everyday chauvenism, when, 
under the influence of economic disintegration and political 
instability, the mechanism of national self defense will begin 
to operate in the public consciousness, growing into aggressive 
behavior. 
  If we do not oppose this process now, then, by its 
consequences, the nationalism of a large people cannot be 
compared to any social catastrophes. 
<H6>  Territorial Disputes Between Russia and the `Near Abroad' 
Countries and Within Russia </H6>
  Although there are no pretensions between the republics of 
the former USSR at the state level, in fact there are a number 
of situations which, under certain circumstances, may turn 
latent (hidden) processes into open ones. 
  First of all, this is manifested in the position of part of 
the Russian population (and certain foreign national groups 
associated with them) not to migrate to Russia, but to go under 
Russia's jurisdiction together with the territory on which they 
are living. This concerns the Dniester region, the Crimea, the 
region of Kokhtla-Yarve and Narva in Estonia, and certain 
regions in the Northern Caucasus and Eastern Ukraine. 
  Secondly, this is the desire by a number of autonomies or a 
number of peoples to enter the make-up of the Russian 
Federation--Abkhaziya, South Ossetia, or the Lezghin (37 percent 
of whom presently live in Azerbaijan). 
  Thirdly, there are territorial claims also inside the 
republics, stemming from the fact that the people of a given 
nationality live on adjoining territories. This is manifested in 
the claims of a number of political leaders of Tatarstan to 
regions with a predominant Tatar population in the Republic of 
Mari El and the Republic of Bashkortostan, and in Ulyanovsk and 
Samara Oblasts. Among the Komi people, the notion of 
reunification with the Komi-Permyaks, who have their own okrug 
within Perm Oblast, is actively propagandized. There is an 
analogous situation in Buryatiya, where the idea of 
reunification with fellow countrymen having their national 
formations in Irkutsk and Chita Oblasts is actively supported. 
An intensification of Kalmykiya's claims regarding the regions 
which have been "lost" and handed over to Astrakhan Oblast and 
Krasnodar Kray can also not be excluded. 
  And finally, there is the desire by a number of peoples, 
especially those who had been previously deported and now 
returned to their homeland, to regain all the territory which 
previously belonged to them. 
  The problem of the Germans in the Povolzhye [Volga region] 
occupies a special place. And although many demands have as yet 
been expressed in the form of wishes, this does not remove the 
danger of aspirations to review the boundaries. 
  Despite all the disputes, indecisiveness and even historical 
injustice, to try to change the existing boundaries at the 
present time means to create a dangerous groundwork for the 
emergence of bloody inter-ethnic conflicts. Moreover, the first 
precedent of this sort will open the way for violence on an 
inter-ethnic basis, which, taking on an avalanche character, has 
the prospect of lasting for many generations. 
  All disputed questions must be resolved only by means of 
lengthy negotiations and through striving for accord. In this 
sense, we must return once again and permanently declare a 
correction to the previously adopted law, "On Rehabilitation of 
Repressed Peoples," which states that their political 
rehabilitation is associated with the restoration of the 
boundaries lost during the time of relocation of these peoples. 
As experience shows, the implementation of this law in terms of 
defining the national-territorial boundaries must be repealed, 
making the consideration of the interests of the peoples 
previously living here dependant on other methods of resolution. 
<H6>  The minor peoples (national minorities) </H6>
  Among the most numerous people of Russia, aside from the 
Russians (82 percent), are the Tatars (3.7), Ukrainians (3 
percent), Chuvash (1.2 percent), Bashkirs (0.9 percent), the 
peoples of Dagestan (1.2 percent), and the Belorussians (0.7 
percent). These seven peoples make up 93 percent of the 
population. The remaining 7 percent are comprised of 110 
peoples, among which only 26 number more than 100,000 persons. 
Thus, there are currently 29 primary peoples residing in 
Dagestan (according to the census of 1926 there were 81 ethnic 
groups). 
  On the whole, the picture appears as follows: 16 national 
groups (a total of 7.8 million people) represent the peoples of 
the CIS countries; 30 national groups (1.3 million people) 
represent the peoples outside the boundaries of the CIS 
countries (Englishmen, Bulgarians, Finns, etc.); Another 30 
national groups (173,000 people) represent the peoples which do 
not have statehood anywhere in the world (Gypsies, Assyrians, 
Uygurs, Kurds, etc.). There are another 22 peoples (116,000) 
living in Russia but not having national-territorial formations. 
And, finally, there are 10 peoples (67,000 people) who do not 
have any national territories, neither in the RF, nor in the 
CIS, nor in third countries. 
  Based on the fact of such a large number of peoples, we may 
conclude that the primary means of development for most of them 
is the creation and strengthening of a national-cultural, and in 
a number of places also a national-territorial autonomy. In 
principle this is the most progressive approach for Russia, in 
which, due to historical peculiarities, the national groups are 
found in compact groups as well as being dispersed. 
  As for the representatives of all peoples, it would be 
possible to create a civic (national) assembly under the Russian 
government, which would operate as a consultative organ 
according to the principle of representation: One people--one 
vote. 
<H6>  Possible Scenarios for the Development of the Ethnopolitical 
Process </H6>
  These scenarios are closely associated with the resolution 
of 
cardinal tasks on reforming Russia, and with the effect of 
outlined tendencies in the development of basic spheres of 
society, including the sphere of relations between various 
ethnic communities and groups and their political structures. 
  Variant 1. This could be called the ideal. It 
presupposes the development of events under which the program of 
stabilization of the economy would be successfully realized, 
social protection of the population would be ensured, the 
impulses of market relations would manifest themselves in a 
positive manner, demands would be unconditionally met, including 
those directly relating to the problems of inter-ethnic 
relations on the basis of the negotiation process. 
  In this case, we would be able to expect a resolution of 
acute inter-ethnic conflicts, an extinguishing of the "hot 
spots," and a significant reduction in the level of tensions in 
inter-ethnic relations. 
  However, the realities are such that the negative factors in 
the economy in 1994 will not disappear, and at times may even 
make themselves known in more acute forms. The currently 
intensifying heterogeneity in development of subjects of the RF, 
and the national-state and national-territorial transformations 
are manifested in the ever-deepening gap in living standards, 
and in the indicators of meeting the material and cultural needs 
of various ethnic groups. As for the possibility of the effect 
of such a factor of a centripetal tendency as the constitution, 
this is in grave doubt. Based on the fact that the constitution 
has been adopted by only a part of the republics, efforts at its 
active application may evidently exacerbate inter-ethnic 
contradictions to a certain degree and intensify the negative 
attitude of the ethnopolitical elite in some republics who view 
the RF Basic Law as an effort to "tighten the screws" on the 
part of the center and to turn Russia into a dictatorship or at 
best a unitarian state. 
  Thus, the factors stimulating centrifugal tendencies are 
still strongly making themselves known. Therefore, the examined 
variant of the prognosis, if we keep in mind the near future, is 
improbable. 
  Variant 2. This characterizes the disperse state 
of inter-ethnic relations in Russia, distinguished by a rather 
high degree of tension and national-regional instability. We are 
speaking specifically about the fact that tensions may be 
manifested in one form or another within the scope of one or 
several regions. These are primarily the Northern Caucasus, 
Povolzhye, certain border zones, places of accumulation of 
refugees, etc. This variant is probably the most likely. Under 
such a variation, the primary task will consist of putting a 
timely end to the conflagration in one region or another, using 
non-violent methods wherever possible, and not allowing the 
conflict to expand to an all-federal level. Evidently, it will 
be necessary to act in such a manner for a number of years. An 
obstacle to the realization of this variant will be the rather 
deep mistrust of the real possibilities and abilities of the 
power structures to resolve inter-ethnic conflicts. 
  Variant 3. This may conditionally be called the 
"division of Russia." Its scenario presupposes the possibility 
of such a situation when several republics at once (for example, 
two or three) reject the requirements of the RF Constitution, 
and in the process of the escalating confrontation with the 
center strive to leave the make-up of the Federation. 
  In no case should we underestimate this variant, even though 
it seems significantly less probable than the second. 
  Variant 4. The "Yugoslavian." This is war, blood, 
pain and suffering for millions of people--representatives of 
various ethnic groups. It is the least probable and is reviewed 
only as a warning. However, we must not lose vigilance. The 
world of inter-ethnic relations is so complex and multiplanar 
that what yestereday seemed merely an "abnormal" phenomenon may 
tomorrow suddenly turn out to be a great misfortune.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Office for Combating Organized Crime </F>
Against the Mafia: Offensive Continues"] 
  [Text] A briefing of leaders of the Office for 
Combating Organized Crime (UOP) was held yesterday in the 
republic's MVD. 
  Office Chief R. Galimbekov, who was appointed to this 
position last November, told the representatives of the news 
media about the current business and immediate plans of the 
structural subdivision of the law enforcement authorities that 
is at the forward edge of the fight against crime. In recent 
months the UOP has stepped up its activity considerably by way 
of the organization of new departments in cities and rayons of 
the republic, reinforcement of the physical plant, and closer 
interaction with the KGB, criminal investigation, the Office for 
Economic Crimes, and other services of the MVD. 
  More than 20 of the 109 registered criminal groupings have 
been neutralized and broken up and criminal proceedings have 
been and continue to be instituted against more than 500 of 
their active members and leaders in the republic in recent 
months with the direct involvement of the UOP. A large quantity 
of firearms, ammunition, hardware, and financial resources has 
been confiscated from the criminals.

<F P=106> [Tamara Levina report: "An Agreement That Stabilizes Life"] </F>
  [Text] An agreement among the Cabinet of Ministers of 
the Republic of Tatarstan, the republic Council of Trade Unions, 
and the Association of State-Owned Enterprises of Tatarstan for 
1994 was ceremonially signed in Kazan yesterday. The document 
was sealed by the signatures of Mukhammat Sabirov, prime 
minister of the Republic of Tatarstan, Farida Gaynullina, 
chairman of the republic Council of Trade Unions, and Yuner 
Yemaletdinov, president of the Association of State-Owned 
Enterprises. 
  This is the fourth agreement among the government, the 
unions, and the employers on joint participation and guarantees 
in the solution of labor and socioeconomic questions based on 
current legislation and the implementation of additional 
measures. The previous ones helped create in Tatarstan a 
well-oiled system of targeted social protection, curb the growth 
of unemployment, preserve the system of preschools, and decide a 
number of other questions. 
  The present year does not promise to be easy, and the new 
agreement provides for the creation of conditions for 
stabilization of the economy, social protection for the working 
people and public, jobs for the population and development of 
the labor market, pay and occupational and environmental safety 
guarantees, and development of the social sphere in rural 
localities. The commitments of each of the parties are clearly 
drawn. For example, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of 
Tatarstan will retain state regulation of the maximum levels of 
profitability and fixed prices on products of the monopoly 
sectors and enterprises, energy, and socially significant groups 
of commodities (individual foods, prescription drugs and 
medication, children's items, and so forth) and also on vitally 
important services, the public service of passenger transport, 
individual types of communications services, and public 
utilities, public gas, electric, and heating tariffs, and the 
charge for housing, having entered the corresponding resources 
in the republic budget. The Association of State-Owned 
Enterprises of the Republic of Tatarstan will organize work on 
placing at the enterprises orders for the manufacture of 
machinery, mechanisms, equipment, instruments, and spares for 
the needs of the national economy of the Republic of Tatarstan. 
  In addition, from the resources of state social insurance 
the 
parties plan to send to sanatoriums and recreation centers 
43,000 workers (including 2,700 children); to preventive 
health-sanatoriums, 80,000 persons (10,000 children); to 
health-and-fitness camps, 135,000 children. 
  The agreement took effect the moment it was signed.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazbek Gostiyev, chairman of the board of the </F>
North Ossetian Fund for the Restoration of National Traditions 
and Customs: "Destined To Be Neighbors"] 
  [Text] The Ossetian-Ingush emergency zone is still in 
a state of emergency. After taking a first-hand look at the 
situation there, B.N. Yeltsin signed an edict "On the Procedure 
For Returning Refugees and Victims of Forced Resettlement Within 
the Territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush 
Republic to Their Permanent Place of Residence." The edict 
evoked conflicting reactions in the two republics. 
  In any case, one thing is clear: Until the causes of 
the confrontation between the two republics have been eliminated 
and public thinking has undergone radical changes, it will be 
difficult to expect these measures to have the desired impact. 
The tense atmosphere has to be defused, and all of the attempts 
to do this have been clearly inadequate. 
<H5>  From Hatred to Tolerance </H5>
  In my opinion, there is a method of paving the way for the 
peaceful resolution of the conflict. 
  The first condition would be the identification of the group 
of individuals who have committed serious crimes that are 
punishable by all standards of law and morality in any country. 
This could turn out to be impossible, but as long as murderers 
and warmongers are not governed by the criminal code of the 
Russian Federation, genuine reconciliation will be out of the 
question. 
  The second condition is the use of the ethical factor. It 
consists in the wisdom of our people, who developed a procedure 
long ago for the reconciliation of conflicting parties. In 
essence, until the parties in a blood feud had reconciled, they 
would have to live according to the Islamic common law of the 
mountain people, with strict rules governing each step they 
took, even going so far as to tell them which streets they could 
use, which places they could visit, and which party would have 
to yield the road to the other. 
  These strict rules of behavior in blood feuds attest to the 
use of separation as the main deterrent. This was done because 
feelings of rage and revenge were so strong that the feuding 
parties would kill each other when they met. It was not until 
after reconciliation that mediators and the close associates of 
the feuding parties would begin establishing favorable 
conditions (an art in itself) for communication, contacts, 
"chance meetings," and other exchanges between the reconciled 
parties. The process was accomplished one step at a time. 
  Our leaders would be completely justified in making use of 
the priceless experience of past generations in big politics. 
  For the sake of peace and accord, we need compromises and 
mutual concessions, and in this context it is extremely 
important for one nationality to put itself in the other's 
place, guided by the golden rule of morality: "Do unto others as 
you would have them do unto you." In this context, I am 
proposing a "program of emergence from crisis." 
<H5>  The Reality Factor </H5>
  The stream of unsubstantiated mutual accusations and 
seething 
passions are keeping the two nationalities from taking a sober 
look at one another and realizing that they are both victims of 
the totalitarian regime. 
  The Ingush people have to realize that the Ossetians did not 
seize a single inch of Ingush land themselves. As for the 
disputed rural communities in Prigorodnyy Rayon, they became 
part of North Ossetia in 1944 by a decision of the government 
officials of that time, who were demanding the settlement of 
these territories. The people there now are third-generation 
natives with no other homeland. Their forcible inclusion in the 
Ingush Republic is a new act of violence, which cannot 
contribute anything, to put it mildly, to the improvement of the 
situation. 
  In short, it is impossible to ignore the historical 
realities 
that took shape in Prigorodnyy Rayon over the last 50 years, 
irrespective of our wishes and opinions. These realities have 
much more force than emotional outbursts and mercenary 
interests, and the main one is the fact that the inhabitants of 
Prigorodnyy Rayon, with the exception of people of the Ingush 
nationality, categorically oppose their annexation by another 
republic. Their forced annexation would put us on the road to 
war, with all of its tragic consequences. 
  Although I wish to retain an objective view of the actions 
of 
both sides, I would like to say that the Ossetians should 
sympathize more with the suffering of the Ingush people, the 
tragedy of their forcible eviction, and the difficulties of 
returning to their historical homeland and settling down there. 
This applies to the past and the present. 
  Tens of thousands of innocent families lost their homes and 
livelihood. They are victims, not criminals: No one leaves his 
home, and everything he has ever worked for, by choice. We 
cannot call ourselves civilized if we are indifferent to the 
suffering of people to whom we are related by a common history. 
  By the same token, it seems to me that the Ingush people 
also 
should be more careful in choosing their leaders. Ambitious 
extremists and mafia elements have driven their people to the 
verge of ruin. Their actions and appeals for the violent 
resolution of the territorial dispute have been ruinous for 
their innocent and unfortunate people. 
<H5>  Renounce the Blood Feud </H5>
  The art of public diplomacy consists in promoting the kind 
of 
situation in which mutual forgiveness lies at the basis of 
reconciliation. The reconciliation of the parties in the blood 
feud could breach the thinking of most people and help them move 
from a state of mutual hatred to a recognition of the need to 
live in peace. Whether we like it or not, we were chosen by God 
and Destiny to live as neighbors. The sooner we realize this, 
the quicker the process of resolution will be. We have to 
finally admit that we have no other choice. The only alternative 
is brutal confrontation and war. 
  There is still a good chance that reason will prevail and 
that our people will find the road to peace and accord. 
  [Box] 
<H5>  Program of Emergence From Crisis </H5>
  1. A coordinating council, elected from among national and 
religious authorities with the participation of official 
government agencies, will set up reconciliation commissions in 
the republics of Ingushetia and North Ossetia on the republic, 
rayon, village, neighborhood, street, and building levels for 
the reconciliation of the feuding parties and the families of 
the deceased. 
  2. The reconciliation commissions in the republics of North 
Ossetia and Ingushetia, in contrast to conciliation commissions, 
must do the following: 
  a) compile absolutely precise lists of the names of 
individuals who lost members of their families in the armed 
conflict in October-November 1992; 
  b) conduct meetings with victims (those who lost family 
members) in North Ossetia and in Ingushetia and, after 
preliminary agreement on the terms of reconciliation, seek their 
approval of a declaration of reconciliation between the two 
nationalities and their refusal to persecute anyone for the 
bloodshed; 
  c) elect authorized representatives of each side at meetings 
of the reconciliation commissions in the republics of North 
Ossetia and Ingushetia, with mediators from the Russian 
Federation and the republics, krays, and oblasts of the North 
Caucasus, and the possible participation of observers from the 
international community if necessary; 
  d) conduct an official forum of authorized representatives, 
who will sign a memorandum based on the decisions of the 
reconciliation commissions at a joint meeting; 
  e) complete the reconciliation by organizing a 
reconciliation 
table, where both sides will take a sacred vow--orally, in 
accordance with the customs of the Caucasus--to never resort to 
the use of arms again in the settlement of disagreements, 
reinforcing this commitment by shaking hands and calling upon 
Almighty God and all of the saints as witnesses. 
  3. The process of the reconciliation of feuding parties will 
not apply to those who treated their victims with brutality and 
savagery. 
  4. An essential condition for the reconciliation of the 
parties in a blood feud is the payment of blood money, taking 
the form of financial compensation and emotional satisfaction. 
  5. During the reconciliation process, conciliation 
commissions will also be working simultaneously on solutions to 
two major problems: 
  a) the search for missing persons; 
  b) the return (sequential) of innocent victims to their 
previous place of residence.

<F P=106> [Interview with I. Bechelov, by I. Mezova: "Ilyas Bechelov: </F>
I See in Today's Parliament Elements of Reforming the 
Representative Authority"] 
  [Text] Ilyas Bechelov is a colonel in the internal 
service, former chief of the Corrective Affairs and Social 
Rehabilitation Service, and chairman of the Legislative 
Commission of the former KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] VS 
[Supreme Soviet]. He is a graduate of the School of Physics and 
Mathematics, KBGU [Kabardino-Balkaria State University] and the 
USSR MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Academy. At the December 
election he once again became a deputy to the Council of the 
Republic of the KBR Parliament and once again headed the same 
commission -- the Commission on Legislation, Law and Order, 
Security, and Human Rights. He is married, and has a son and two 
daughters. 
  [Mezova] Ilyas Borisovich, why, after serving twenty years 
in 
the MVD system, did you decide to run for election, first to the 
Supreme Soviet, and then to the KBR Parliament? 
  [Bechelov] For me it was a complete surprise when, in 1991, 
people from my home town in Kamenka came to me and suggested 
that they nominate me as a candidate for election to the Supreme 
Soviet. I must confess that many people advised me not to run, 
saying that an MVD worker would not be elected, especially since 
there were more popular candidates, including farm managers. 
Nevertheless I agreed and, to my surprise, I won. It may be that 
something that played a role was the fact that I had grown up in 
Kamenka and had gone to school there. I have a lot of friends in 
the district: Balkarians, Karbadinians, Russians... 
  [Mezova] In December of last year you decided to run for 
election again. Does that mean that you didn't really like the 
work of making laws? 
  [Bechelov] At first I did not want to run again, and I even 
took a job at the Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral Commission]. 
In general, I was planning to return to the MVD. After all, it 
is specific work that I was accustomed to. Once again the voters 
began arriving. My current electoral district is big, and is 
absorbing a large number of populated places: Bulungu, 
Khushto-Syrt, Nizhniy Chegem, Yanikoy, Lechinka, Kamenka... I 
was nominated by the collective at the Sovkhoz imeni 
Baysultanov, and the voters -- and I am tremendously grateful to 
them for this --supported me again. 
  [Mezova] But certainly it must not have been such a simple 
thing, after the MVD, to engage -- and successfully -- in the 
work of creating legislation. 
  [Bechelov] Definitely... There is a big difference in the 
nature of the work. At first I was greatly tormented by all that 
paperwork. I was not accustomed to that kind of monotonous, 
painstaking work. However, I adjusted to it gradually and have 
even learned to enjoy it. 
  [Mezova] But how do you sense the difference in the 
activities of the former Supreme Soviet and the present Council 
of the Republic, which is operating on a professional basis? 
  [Bechelov] Here too there is a substantial difference. The 
work at the Council of the Republic is proceeding, in my 
opinion, in a time-responsive and efficient manner. We literally 
"chewed up" our Provisional Rules, for example, since we worked 
so carefully on them. We passed them in two readings. Of course, 
the working commission responsible for developing and modifying 
that vast document also worked scrupulously. The document is 
ready for publication. On the insistence of Yuriy Mairov, 
Chairman of the KBR Constitutional Court, we thoroughly wrote 
out the procedure for reviewing the budget and included it in 
the Rules. 
  [Mezova] Was the budget under joint jurisdiction from the 
very beginning? 
  [Bechelov] Yes. Its initial review was our responsibility. 
  [Mezova] Is there a difference between the initial and 
secondary discussions? 
  [Bechelov] The difference is contained in the names 
themselves. We are the first to review the document. The 
Representatives' Council accepts our recommendations and 
comments and, after discussion, submits the document for joint 
review. 
  [Mezova] Are you satisfied with the powers that have been 
assigned to the Council of the Republic? 
  [Bechelov] The question of powers was resolved in a 
constitutional and, in my opinion, completely satisfactory 
manner. We shared with the Representatives' Council the question 
of confidence or lack of confidence in the government, and the 
Representatives' Council, in its turn, shared with us the 
question of reviewing the budget. It is completely logical that 
such important questions have to be reviewed jointly. I also 
consider it to be correct that a large number of other questions 
are also under joint jurisdiction. In that way they will be 
developed more efficiently. It would scarcely seem to be 
desirable to transfer just to the Council of the Republic all 
the questions that the Supreme Soviet used to engage in. 
  [Mezova] What other differences do you think exist between 
the present Parliament and the former KBR VS? 
  [Bechelov] Primarily there has been a change in the 
functions 
and the structure. There is no Presidium, that narrow group of 
people that used to decide many very important questions, 
including those dealing with personnel. In order to resolve 
specifically the joint questions and to define the agenda of the 
joint sessions, the Coordination Council was created. In today's 
Parliament I see, to a certain extent, elements of reforming the 
representative authority. 
  [Mezova] Could we dwell more concretely on those elements? 
  [Bechelov] First of all, there is the two-house system, the 
beginning of the formation of a professional parliament, albeit 
by way of one house. Today the Parliament will resolve questions 
of an interethnic nature through a committee that was specially 
created for that purpose; the procedure for reviewing and making 
decisions dealing with those questions has already been firmly 
established in the Constitution. 
  [Mezova] What can you say about the makeup of the Council of 
the Republic? 
  [Bechelov] It seems to me that, on the whole, the deputies 
to 
that house are rather competent and are capable resolving any 
questions. They have a sufficient amount both of professional 
and everyday experience, and the necessary logic for thinking 
things out. I do not see in our house any people who are 
extremist in their views, but all of them are rather 
independent. There are many young people, and I like to work 
with them: they are restrained and knowledgeable people. The 
makeup of the house is rather varied. Many people have left 
their jobs and have taken up the professional work of creating 
legislation. I am convinced that, in a year, the Council of the 
Republic will be asserting itself in a loud voice. 
  [Mezova] Do you foresee the formation of factions and blocs 
in the Council of the Republic? 
  [Bechelov] Most of the deputies, it seems to me, adhere to 
centrist views. Possible blocs based on nationality are absorbed 
by the Committee on Interethnic Relations. 
  [Mezova] What will your commission, which is one of the 
leading ones in the house, engage in? 
  [Bechelov] There is no need to offend the other commissions, 
each of which is the base commission in its field for the 
creation of legislation. Naturally, we shall create laws, 
conduct parliamentary hearings and audits, take active part in 
developing RF [Russian Federation] legislative acts, and give 
our findings on drafts that are prepared by other commissions. 
  [Mezova] Am I correct in thinking that your commission needs 
professionals more than any other one does? 
  [Bechelov] The makeup of the commission is rather good, and 
professionally trained. In addition to me there are Khazan 
Shorov, a jurist and militia lieutenant-colonel; Zamir 
Shibzukhov, investigator from the Urvanskiy procurator's office; 
Khazanbi Shogenov, criminal-affairs procurator from the KBR 
procurator's office; Vitaliy Protasov, retired colonel; and 
Robert Zhurtov, economist, correspondence-course student at the 
KBGU Law School. 
  [Mezova] At the beginning of our conversation you mentioned 
in passing what a few people have been asserting: that an MVD 
worker would not be elected. But in the present Parliament MVD 
workers have occupied what I think is a rather solid position. 
Do you think that this attests to the fact that the population's 
attitude toward your associates is changing? 
  [Bechelov] Yes, there are six of us in the makeup of the 
present Parliament. I must say that Khusey Eneyev, Yuriy Kokov, 
Khasan Shorov, Boris Kerefov, and Adalbi Shkhagoshev are not 
only real professionals, but are also people whose reputations 
are completely unsullied. Yes, I am convinced that people's idea 
of the MVD is changing. Also, it is obvious that the crime 
problem that is engulfing us must be resolved. And, finally, 
this fact attests to people's confidence and high evaluation, 
and this must be perceived as an advance. 
  [Mezova] Are you satisfied with the house's Provisional 
Rules? 
  [Bechelov] In my opinion, there have been definite 
achievements. The most important questions will be decided by 
secret voting. The house's work is carried out in three state 
languages. A question that has caused long disputes is the 
question of keeping an account of the work performed by the 
deputy. A new section on parliamentary hearings provides 
considerable rights to the commissions for reviewing various 
important questions. For the first time the Provisional Rules 
deal with the procedure for holding sessions, and define the 
spring and autumn sessions and the summer and winter 
parliamentary vacations. 
  [Mezova] Almost two vacations? Isn't that too lavish? 
  [Bechelov] That is how it is done throughout the civilized 
world. And the same thing is stated in the Russian rules. The 
work days have been defined: Monday and Tuesday in the permanent 
commissions; Wednesday and Thursday, house sessions; and on 
Friday the deputies work in the districts. We have also planned 
that on Thursdays, for one hour,nd that the members of the 
government will reply to the deputies' oral or written questions. 
  [Mezova] Do you think that, in the new Parliament, the 
status 
of deputy has risen, or has fallen? 
  [Bechelov] I think that it has risen. First of all, a 
professional house has appeared. That is on the whole. This is 
attested to by the procedure for reviewing questions at the 
sessions, and by the parliamentary hearings... 
  [Mezova] What are the tasks that are confronting the house 
in 
the near future? 
  [Bechelov] Our commission has defined a working group to 
develop drafts about local self-government. Other groups have 
been created: a group to prepare the publication of the KBR 
Constitution (Basic Law) with a consideration of the amendments 
and additions that have been made; and a group to develop the 
Rules for the joint sessions of the two houses. Things are also 
proceeding in the same way in the other commissions. In general, 
the ice has been broken, and our speaker was right when he said 
in an interview that the house has taken the direct line in 
creating legislation. 
  [Mezova] Is there anything that you would like to convey to 
your constituents and the readers of our newspaper? 
  [Bechelov] Almost all the deputies, in their pre-election 
statements, mentioned the need to preserve peace and stability 
in the republic. I would hope that everyone will remember that 
and will apply all his efforts to assure that our nation lives 
in tranquility.

<F P=106> [Interview with M. Zhaboyev, under rubric "Politics," by I. </F>
Mezova: "Makhmud Zhaboyev: I Like To Be Surrounded by Strong 
People..."] 
  [Text] After the 12 December 1993 election, one of 
the houses of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] Parliament 
-- the Representatives' Council -- was headed by 55-year-old M. 
N. Zhaboyev, who had previously worked for more than 30 years at 
the Tyrnyauz Tungsten-Molybdenum Combine. 
  [Mezova] Makhmud Nazirovich, you are a new person in the 
republic's agencies of authority. Could you tell our readers a 
bit about yourself? 
  [Zhaboyev] I was born in 1938 in the settlement of Belaya 
Rechka, in a school teacher's family. My father was called to 
the front on the second day of the war, and he never returned. 
He did not even manage to come home to say goodbye, but I am 
told that he wanted very much to see me, his elder son, before 
he left. My cousin, hearing about this, put me on his bicycle, 
and we dashed to the railroad station, but we were too late. In 
1946 my mother died in Kirgizia, where she had gone, together 
with many other Balkarians who had been forcibly evicted from 
their homeland. My younger brother, five-year-old Muzafar, and I 
were left completely alone. 
  [Mezova] You were about eight years old. How, then, did your 
life unfold? 
  [Zhaboyev] We were taken in by uncles on my father's side 
who 
were living at that time in Kazakhstan. I grew up in the family 
of Sultan Babayev, and Muzafar grow up in the family of Musa 
Sozayev. We were among the first to return to our homeland -- in 
1955. My uncle's family was one of three that had received 
authorization to do that, and so we came here. I was still in 
the tenth grade then. At first, everything in our life was 
complicated, so my uncle took me to a boarding school for 
orphans. The people met me there, to my surprise, in a welcoming 
way, and I completed my schooling there. Nevertheless, I never 
did get the reservation [for higher education] that was issued 
to almost all the children at the boarding school, even though I 
had received a good certificate: I had let people know my 
feelings about the so-called Balkarian question, which had not 
yet been finally resolved. But I did not get depressed about 
that. Instead I enrolled at the Kiev Polytechnical Institute. 
  [Mezova] You went to Kiev? Why did you go so far away? 
  [Zhaboyev] The fact of the matter is that my father had sent 
his last letter from around there, and somewhere deep within my 
soul I harbored a crazy, completely unfounded hope. Anything can 
happen, I kept telling myself, and suddenly I would find out 
something. But my trips through the archives and the graveyards 
did not yield anything. I did not see my father's first or last 
name anywhere. 
  [Mezova] So you enrolled at the institute. How did your 
education go there? 
  [Zhaboyev] I passed my examinations, got through the 
competition, and, naturally, enrolled there. My education 
proceeded normally. I got a stipend, and that practically was 
all I had to live on. Although I did find odd jobs from time to 
time. I became friends with some Ukrainian guys, about whom I 
still have the best recollections: knowing my situation, they 
always shared with me the food that their parents had sent them. 
  [Mezova] What specialty did you acquire? 
  [Zhaboyev] Mining engineer. The year was 1961. The institute 
received a telephone call from Kabardino-Balkaria about student 
Zhaboyev. But they did not want to release me. There was also a 
shortage of specialists in Kiev. After much difficulty I managed 
to get released, and arrived at my homeland. However, in 
Tyrnyauz the chief of the Molibden [Molybdenum] Mine said that 
there was no work for me. 
  [Mezova] What? After they had called for you? 
  [Zhaboyev] Not only that, but I said that I was agreeable to 
begin working there, but that was not to his liking. It was not 
until chief accountant Zhilyayev and chief geologist Dzagoyev 
intervened that I was given a job. Two months later the same 
mine chief, thanks to what he called my good references, made me 
a mining foreman. 
  [Mezova] And you have been working at the combine since 
then? 
  [Zhaboyev] In general, yes. But in 1963 I was elected first 
secretary of the Komsomol's first Tyrnyauz City Committee. I 
worked two years there and decided to return to the combine. 
  [Mezova] Why? Didn't you like Komsomol work? 
  [Zhaboyev] It was not because I didn't like it or that it 
wasn't in my area of specialization. They even asked me to 
continue working there. But my heart was drawn more to a 
specific kind of work, and I had to stand on my own two feet as 
a professional. At any rate, in order to make a statement about 
myself in public work or politics, I had to have two kinds of 
experience --everyday experience and professional experience. 
  [Mezova] Did you return to the same position? 
  [Zhaboyev] Yes, the position of mining foreman. And I went 
up 
absolutely all the rungs of my career ladder. My last position 
at the combine was chief engineer. The time was good, especially 
when I was working as the chief of high-speed drilling. It was 
fashionable at that time -- that is, it was not fashionable, but 
there a requirement of the day, inasmuch as the international 
situation was complicated and there was a need for metal -- to 
establish records. Twice we established nationwide records for 
the drilling of mines, and twice I was received by the country's 
minister of nonferrous metallurgy. I also received awards 
--governmental orders and medals. The most cherished of them 
were the VDNKh [Exhibition of the Achievements of the National 
Economy] Gold Medal and the badge "In Recognition of Aggressive 
Work in the Komsomol." 
  [Mezova] All told, you gave the combine 31 years. Am I 
correct in thinking that it was not so simple for you to break 
away from it, to change your life so sharply? 
  [Zhaboyev] Yes, it was no simple matter, and it is not even 
a 
matter of the number of years. In my previous work, things were 
more concrete, and one could see the results more clearly. There 
were more opportunities to display my on-the-job qualities 
there. And also, to tell the truth, there is nothing that can 
replace communicating with the working class, with unspoiled, 
unsophisticated people. These actually are not high-sounding 
words for me. Thanks to the workers, I felt strong. I was 
convinced that they would never let me down, and I would never 
let them down either. 
  [Mezova] And so, Makhmud Nazirovich, you arrived at 
Parliament. With what hopes? What did you hope to bring into its 
activity? 
  [Zhaboyev] You can see what we turned production into. We 
enterprise managers rushed into politics in order to exert an 
influence on the poorly thought-out, unjust attitude toward the 
producer. Do you think that the director corps developed this 
aggressiveness from having had a good life? Industry is in a 
very serious situation. The kolkhozes are being ruined. It is 
unbearable to feel helpless and incapable of helping one's own 
collective. People would say, "Hand over your last jacket 
without even thinking about it!" But what justifications were 
there for bringing the country to that point? None. 
  [Mezova] There are a lot of famous people in your house 
--administration heads, and managers of large enterprises, 
kolkhozes, and sovkhozes. Do you think that they will succeed in 
making life better for the nation? 
  [Zhaboyev] Unfortunately, everything does not depend on us. 
It is impossible to build a good life in an individual republic 
when things are bad all around. First, I am convinced that we 
shall never get rich unless we economize. 
  [Mezova] How do you think we must or can economize? 
  [Zhaboyev] It is necessary to put the budget under strict 
monitoring: where is the money going, for what purpose, and what 
return will it provide? The money should not disappear down a 
hole in the ice. Instead it should float to the surface in the 
form of new schools, new shops, etc. That process should be 
broadly illumined. Secondly, taxes and all kinds of assessments 
have stifled both the private and state producers. Someone ought 
to study this situation. 
  [Mezova] Who, for example? 
  [Zhaboyev] Maybe even Parliament. The appropriate 
commissions 
of both houses should analyze the situation, develop specific 
recommendations, and submit them to the government. The third 
problem is crime. In order to eradicate it, it is necessary to 
create new jobs. It is necessary to give a person the 
opportunity to earn a living by honest labor. If he is deprived 
of that opportunity, he chooses another path. 
  [Mezova] How can we create new jobs if the jobs that do 
exist 
are standing idle? 
  [Zhaboyev] I currently drive out to the enterprises and 
become acquainted with their financial and economic situation. I 
have also recommended that to our deputies. We must not bring 
everyone to the point of collapse. A few more and even the 
director corps will be unable to withstand it. Incidentally, in 
our republic that corps is very strong. Nor is the 
engineer-administrative complement any weaker. It is simply 
criminal to lose it. After all, it took three or four decades to 
create it. 
  [Mezova] You have a large amount of practical experience, as 
well as an equal amount of everyday experience. How do you think 
the republic should attempt to get out of the crisis? Are 
there any previously unused reserves? 
  [Zhaboyev] Our agriculture and industry are operating at a 
loss. In my opinion, we have good reserves of various types of 
building materials. We have unexploited reserves of millions of 
cubic meters of sand and gravel that are in short supply in 
Stavropol and other regions, and even in foreign countries. 
  A second source of our prosperity could be the tourist 
industry. It might make sense here to take advantage of the 
services of foreign investors, or maybe even to sell certain 
items... But it is necessary to begin somewhere. 
  [Mezova] Parliament was formed not too long ago, but you 
already know many of the members of your house from the previous 
Supreme Soviet. What would you say about the makeup of the 
Representatives' Council? 
  [Zhaboyev] I am very satisfied with it and I feel that it is 
sufficiently strong. Most of the deputies have a large amount of 
everyday and professional experience. In general, I have always 
liked to be surrounded by strong people, by a strong team. In 
Parliament, once again, i have been fortunate in this regard. 
  [Mezova] In addition to the tasks that were previously 
enumerated, what do you consider to be an inseparable task of 
Parliament? 
  [Zhaboyev] The RF government, in my opinion, is making 
certain reasonable attempts to help the producer. For some 
reason they are being ignored or met with bayonets. It seems to 
me that Parliament must go to the Federal Assembly with official 
declarations about supporting the government's efforts and 
stabilizing the population's life. I do not remember any 
precedents for this, but why cannot this be done by way of our 
deputies in the Federal Assembly, of whom we have three? Of 
course, other alternatives are also possible. 
  Something that upsets me very much is the fate of our youth. 
We really ought to revive the public youth organizations, even 
under different names, with other ideals. But they should be 
revived. Such an important job as educating the upcoming 
generation should not be allowed to drift along unguided. 
  [Mezova] I remember, Makhmud Nazirovich, the statement that 
you made against a professional Parliament... 
  [Zhaboyev] Yes, I was against it, inasmuch as I felt that 
the 
parliamentarians would rapidly divorce themselves from the 
vitally important problems, from real life. In any case, we must 
remember that today is not the time for politics mongering. It 
is better to give everyone the opportunity to buy bread. 
  Today Parliament in its work is proceeding, as it were, by 
touch, but I feel that it will find itself and there will be 
work for it to do.

<F P=106> [Article by SELSKAYA ZHIZN correspondent Viktor Karpov, </F>
Pskov Oblast, under rubric "Apropos Notes": "There's No Respect 
for the Mandates...: What the Unheld Election Demonstrated to 
the Pskov Oblast Assembly of Deputies"] 
  [Text] The election to the Pskov Oblast Assembly of 
Deputies was scheduled for 29 January. After the Soviets had 
been dispersed (it is difficult to use any other term), similar 
kray, oblast, and city Dumas, boards, hurals, etc., 
etc. are supposed to be -- in the minds of the new 
"constitutionalists" who seized the upper hand over the Soviet 
authority in October of last year -- from now on the 
representative authority at the regional level. They are 
supposed to be, so to speak, a balance to the executive 
authority. Although what kind of "balance" can that be, if their 
weight categories are simply not comparable? It's like the 
elephant and the mosquito. The executive authority long ago 
become overgrown to its indecently swollen state, and more and 
more departments are multiplying more rapidly than rabbits. 
Incidentally, there were supposed to be a total of 21 "Duma men" 
in that same Pskov Assembly, of whom only eight were "with 
portfolio," that is, salaried. So just try "balancing" this 
incomplete platoon with an army of officials which, a very long 
time ago, became crowded in the thick-walled building of the 
former cadet corps that, quite recently, used to be called the 
oblast House of Soviets. It makes you wonder whether the "Duma 
men" will become such important, but, alas, decorative 
farces majeures under the ruling "court" for the 
purpose of playing ring-around-the-rosy there. 
  As for the ring-around-the-rosy, there have already been 
precedents. You might recall that, at the dawn of perestroyka, 
its "romantic Rastrelli" reproached the Soviets, coupled with 
the trade unions and public organizations: don't play 
ring-around-the-rosy with us "prorabs [work 
superintendents] of perestroyka, but toughen up! Fight for 
people and for their welfare, without worrying about your own 
stomach! But they did not take heed... It was all in vain. They 
played ring-around-the-rosy... The Soviets do not exist as a 
political force -- it took just one rescript to flatten them 
like an importunate fly. The trade unions also do not really 
exist any more, and those that do are completely remote from 
real life... But this is really apropos. Let's return to the 
Pskov election. 
  It was the first election to be held in Russia. It was 
Saturday. I'm sitting there, drinking my tea... The voting 
district where I am registered is around the corner, in a nearby 
school. I wonder whether or not I should go there. I recall how 
many times during the past two years the authority had called 
me, requested me, and entreated me to go to the ballot box so 
that I could give it my mandate to do what it later would 
attempt to do in order to make my life happy and cloudfree. But 
it is becoming not better, but increasingly difficult to live 
from day to day. 
  So I'm sitting there, drinking my tea, and looking out of 
the 
window. I recall how, a month and a half earlier, when our last 
and decisive fight in front of the ballot boxes was announced 
again, people in the dark morning hours (it was, after all, 
December) walked single-file across my courtyard on their way to 
the school. But today it is already the middle of the day, and 
there don't seem to be many citizens who are inspired by the 
election. Just one or two, and that's it. 
  My contemplative tea-drinking was suddenly disturbed. The 
local television company broke off its broadcast on the 
Russia-wide channel, and a member of the okrug electoral 
commission appeared on the screen: my dear voters, he says with 
a somewhat reproachful tone of voice, it might be a good time to 
remind you about performing your civic duty, rather than beating 
all your carpets and vacuuming your rooms. The voting, he said, 
is being discontinued so that it looks as though it might be 
necessary to hold a re-election, once again at the expense of 
you taxpayers. I must confess that this pressure upon my freedom 
of choice, this unceremonious conduct, coupled with the threat 
to empty once again my already empty pocket, irked me. And if 
this had happened in the much vaunted Western democracies, it 
certainly wouldn't have done much good for the frisky guy from 
the electoral commission. Because he broke the citizens' right: 
to vote for, or against, or not at all. And that "hand-breaker" 
who had smashed the voter's hands would have been fired and 
given a big fine,, and the election results would have been 
disputed in court. But that is how "they" do it... 
  In our country, on the other hand, people, even though they 
are not well versed with regard to their electoral right, are 
nevertheless hardened -- they were not even afraid of those 
goadings from the television set. The result was the complete 
failure of the election in Pskov, in Velikiye Luki (and there 
approximately one-third of the electoral oblast), and this 
predetermined the failure of the election to the oblast 
assembly. But in the rural rayons, on the other hand, the 
activity was sufficient, and their residents gave mandates to 
their 13 emissaries to the oblast parliament. (More later about 
why that occurred.) However, there was just one mandate lacking 
to get the quorum necessary to proclaim the oblast assembly of 
deputies. Therefore the oblast parliament has not yet occurred, 
and a re-election has been scheduled for 27 March. That is 
enough time also to think a bit about why today's voter "does 
not have any respect for mandates," and about where the pointer 
of the political barometer in the province is currently pointing. 
  At a session of the okrug electoral commission the election 
results were evaluated as a surprise. A few people also 
mentioned the reason why the people had "voted with their feet": 
they said that, both in Pskov and in Velikiye Luki, on the eve 
of the election not only the so-called "budget people," but also 
the workers at many plants and factories, had not received their 
wages. And if that is so, then why the hell do we need an 
authority that does not pay us for our work? They explained that 
people have got completely tired of elections, referendums, and 
also those that only worsen the Russia-wide crisis. It was noted 
that even the day -- Saturday -- had been poorly chosen. And was 
it really a good idea to come out with this election "ahead of 
all of Russia"? Especially so early, in January, when nothing, 
not even the budget, was yet definite. 
  Well, there probably is a grain of truth in these 
explanations (true, they were made after the fact). They would 
have been exhaustive if the executive authority -- and it was 
precisely that authority that became the lead horse in holding 
the election campaign -- would honestly admit that this time it 
had been undone by impatience. They thought that people had not 
yet recovered after the December "presidential triumph" and once 
again would obediently do what they were told to do. But it did 
not happen... 
  By and large, the voters in the major cities "voted with 
their feet" against the unbearable living conditions today. They 
voted against the reforms being carried out hurriedly, 
high-handedly, at a full gallop. And, finally, the impoverished 
people, who in addition are under the threat of complete 
unemployment tomorrow, oppose such attacks. Are we really 
supposed to believe that there is anyone who does not understand 
this yet? 
  Just as, incidentally, the fact that the voters lowered the 
boom on the way to the seats in the oblast parliament to those 
contenders for those seats who include themselves in the 
"democratic" camp. And with what a clamor they had been making 
their way there! With what "programs"! One contender beat 
himself on the chest, swearing that he would become the only 
defender of all the offended and abused. Another one promised in 
a single blow to end all the political battles that had brought 
the country and the oblast to collapse. And still another one, a 
businessman, planned to start a "vendetta" against bureaucrats 
of all kinds. What scope, what boldness of ideas! One might 
think that this was not an oblast assembly with a clearly 
delineated scope of competency that the person was dashing into, 
but at least some European parliament. "All this, my friend, is 
words, words, words," Pushkin used to say, and so the voter 
proved to be nobody's fool. He saw through the blabbermouths 
with their promises. The rating that most of the "Pskov fathers 
of democracy" got was bad enough for them to shoot themselves. 
  They were not even helped by the "letters of recommendation" 
from the Moscow "fathers of democracy and apostles of reforms," 
that were widely printed in the local newspapers. Yes, that is 
what the general practice is now -- "just like in the better 
homes..." Previously the recommendations used to be given there 
to all the governesses, intellectuals not of noble birth, and 
beginning clerks who were seeking work with ruined 
petty-bourgeois noblemen... Today they also are taking care of 
"their own," but it is their own from one political clan. True, 
it is with the proviso that this "tutor" serves the clan 
loyally. Unfortunately, the undertaking with these letters also 
was unsuccessful. As they say, this is a matter not just of 
cash, but also of the Moscow "wedding generals" who once again 
got into a mess with their wards, this time having proven at the 
regional level that they always, in any pre-election battles, 
superciliously underestimate the voter, refusing the "man in the 
street" the right to decide for himself what is what. 
  And now let us consider this from the position of the oblast 
"province," those 13 rural electoral districts where the 
election to the oblast assembly took place. In and of itself, 
the fact that the "province" had gone to the ballot boxes is not 
really surprising. Even in these harrowing times, the ordinary 
peasant understands that it is impossible to live without 
authority. With authority, things are more reliable. But whether 
the authority always worries about the peasant is another 
question. So he went to the ballot box, taking with him possibly 
his last hope that now Moscow would know what was pressing down 
on the peasant, and that his own homegrown people would do 
everything to stand up for him. So he chose. Whom? The one who 
is well aware of whom he can trust, to whom he is accustomed to 
go with every need of his. 
  Well, actually, why is there a need for some kind of 
laudatory indulgence from some high and mighty "democrat" 
flitting around the Moscow corridors? Why does Ivan 
Mikhaylovich Semenov, director of the Vyazye State Pedigree 
Stock Farm, need it, if the voters of Dedobichskiy and Dnovskiy 
rayons know him as an excellent specialist, organizer, and 
understanding person? If Vyazye, even today, in the grip of 
stifling reforms, continues to be famous for its superelite 
pure-bred hogs which foreigners envy! Or Gennadiy Aleksandrovich 
Sharstuk, chairman of the Pamyat Ilicha Kolkhoz, Pechorskiy 
Rayon, a young, energetic person who, during his short period of 
time as chairman, has completed the construction of an excellent 
settlement on half the kolkhoz -- why does he need it?.. Or 
Aleksandr Ivanovich Bukashkin, who took the Truzhenik Kolkhoz 
out of his father's hands and improved the farm... It is the 
deeds themselves and the Christian spirit of these and other 
agrarians that are the best propaganda for them. 
  Incidentally, the rural candidates, unfortunately, could not 
even count on those propaganda "volleys" by which many of their 
urban associates literally deafened their voters. But the only 
funny thing that happened is that, having lost, certain 
city-dweller candidates immediately began crying, "Who will give 
me back those `lemons' that were spent on the importunate 
`Choose me, choose me...'?" Because it turns out that that's how 
much a seat in the oblast parliament costs -- a paltry two or 
three million. And that is not including the funds that were 
officially allocated to the oblast election along the line of 
Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral Commission]. Funds, we might 
note, that were tremendous. 
  But the "bird of happiness tomorrow," fortunately, is in the 
possession of those who were chosen. It is gratifying that, 
among them, more than a third are pure agrarians. And this is 
symptomatic: in an agrarian oblast, it would seem, the people 
who are running the dance, in the good sense of the word, should 
be people not from the asphalt, but people from the land, people 
from behind the plow. It is good that the legitimate deputies to 
the oblast assembly have already realized that and have offered 
the administration a package of documents pertaining to the fate 
of the agrarian reform in Pskov Oblast. Without waiting for the 
March re-election, they are already holding their working 
meetings, gradually developing the drafts of working documents 
for the oblast "Duma." People like this are not accustomed to 
let things get mired down in empty talking. Thank God!

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Soskov under the rubric "Situation": "An </F>
Oblast-Level Emergency"] 
  [Text] Once again the consolidated budget situation is 
alarming at both the federal and oblast levels. The regions are 
not making ends meet. Arrears in the payment of wages, 
especially to employees of social, cultural, and consumer 
service facilities, come to several months. Social tensions are 
rising, and confidence in the power structures is dwindling. 
Under the circumstances, the regional authorities are more often 
than not acting in the traditional manner: They send envoys to 
the Ministry of Finance, and the envoys try to "lobby" for yet 
another billion for their oblast, kray, or republic. However, 
carving up the budgetary pie is becoming increasingly difficult. 
There is no money. 
  Less frequently, the oblast authorities try to find a way 
out 
on their own, without assistance from the center. After all, it 
is no secret that tremendous amounts are left uncollected at the 
regional level. The Voronezh Oblast administration has resolved 
to get at least some of them. 
  Deputy head of the Voronezh Oblast Administration Igor 
Neznamov said: "For us to live like we did in 1993 the oblast 
needs 240 billion rubles [R] in the first quarter. However, in 
reality a budget of R124 billion has been put together. The 
deficit comes to R116 billion. All these numbers are based on 
prices of the fourth quarter of last year. Meanwhile, prices for 
gasoline, electricity, raw and other materials, and medicines 
increased sharply in January. Prices have gone up, but no 
recalculation has been done so far. As a result, in January 
alone we needed to allocate R80 to the sector financed from the 
budget. However, we were able to fund only R33 billion. 
  As is known, Voronezh Oblast is primarily an agrarian 
region. 
Enterprises of the defense industry account for the bulk of the 
industrial potential, but these enterprises are in need of 
assistance themselves. For example, the neighboring Lipetsk is 
one-half the size of Voronezh in terms of population, but the 
volume of industrial production is two times greater there. 
  In a word, the consolidated budget situation in Voronezh is 
extreme. Suffice it to mention that, if funding for preschool 
facilities is cut off, employment will fall sharply because of 
nonworking mothers, and the volume of industrial production in 
the oblast will decline another 70 percent. Under the 
circumstances, emergency financing procedures were temporarily 
introduced in Voronezh Oblast in March. Governor A. Kovalev 
signed a package of 17 decrees. The task is to regain control of 
the economic situation in the oblast. 
  First of all, measures are envisioned that will bring about 
a 
reduction in the expenditures of the oblast budget. Only the 
"protected" items of expenditure of organizations financed from 
the budget are funded on a priority basis: wages, electricity, 
municipal services. For example, the Decree "On Streamlining 
Funding for Health Care in the Oblast" introduced strict 
item-specific financing in health care facilities of the oblast. 
It is forbidden for hospitals, polyclinics, and medical services 
departments to purchase drugs at prices exceeding the 
wholesale-factory prices of the Farmatsiya state enterprise, or 
to purchase expensive equipment, except for that directly 
supporting the provision of medical care to the population. 
Monitoring of transfers of funds to the fund of compulsory 
medical insurance will be reinforced. 
  Negotiated prices in construction are also becoming a matter 
of the past. Firm cost estimates for construction products are 
being introduced which proceed from the 1991 base price 
multiplied by a uniform sectoral index. The latter will now be 
determined by an oblast center for price setting in the 
construction sector. At the same time, tax relief is envisioned 
for private enterprises building facilities that are included on 
the list of state needs of the oblast. 
  Measures to raise the rate of the profit tax taken in by the 
local budget to 25 percent for enterprises and organizations and 
30 percent for insurance organizations, i.e. 3 and 8 percent 
more, respectively, are aimed at boosting the revenue side of 
the budget. A fee of R2 million a month will be assessed on all 
commercial stands. 
  Mutual offsetting of the debts of enterprises in Voronezh 
Oblast will soon be performed. The plan is to subsequently 
expand it to all oblasts of the Central Chernozem area. 
  In the opinion of Igor Neznamov, carrying out these 
decisions 
will yield about R20 billion per month to the oblast budget. 
This does not solve all the problems, but will be a substantial 
help to the organs of executive power in funding organizations 
financed from the budget.

<F P=106> [Interview with Candidate of Economic Sciences Boris </F>
Melentyev, by VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent Yuriy 
Voronchikhin; place and date not given: "Those Hated Taxes"] 
  [Text] The state tax policy is being subjected to 
serious criticism by entrepreneurs, producers, and the 
population. The issue of creating a federal tax system that is 
differentiated by the country's regions is being raised with 
increasing urgency. Our correspondent met with Candidate of 
Economic Sciences Boris Viktorovich Melentyev, a specialist on 
regional and interregional problems and a research associate at 
the Institute of Economics and Organization of Industrial 
Production of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences. The topic of their conversation is taxes. 
  [Voronchikhin] Boris Viktorovich, literally everyone today 
is 
moaning about chaos in taxation. It is complicated, confusing, 
too much, unfair, and so on. In the past we only knew about 
income tax, plus childless people had to pay a certain 
percentage of their wages. Now there are all sorts of 
deductions. I bet that soon there will a tax on beards. Do we 
really need such a multitude of taxes, and can we not do without 
them altogether? 
  [Melentyev] By tax we usually understand mandatory payments 
appropriated by the state. We usually part with this money with 
regret, especially if taxes are high. Nevertheless, a certain 
part of taxes, especially at the all-Russia (federal) level, are 
a necessary attribute of financial regulation of economic 
activities. They are needed because the state, through tax 
revenue, finances directly out of the budget, among other 
things, defense, the pension and other social funds, targeted 
development of new production, etc. 
  [Voronchikhin] Since it is a "production necessity," 
dictated 
by "harsh reality," then should there not be, instead of the 
chaos that reigns today in state tax policy, a flexible system 
of duties that is agreeable for everyone? 
  [Melentyev] Creating a logical system of taxes is to a 
certain extent an art: They must be simple; the principles for 
calculating them, understandable for everyone; there should not 
be many of them; and they should not be too high and should not 
suppress the initiative of economic growth. In order for taxes 
to serve as active means of state policy, it is desirable that 
they fulfill several functions--for instance, not only ensure 
the flow of revenue, but also stimulate achievement of certain 
policy goals. In particular, high excise tax on tobacco and 
alcohol products constrains consumption of these products by 
young people; increasing tax on profit if it is used for wages 
provides an incentive to direct it into production development. 
  Unfortunately, most existing taxes do not meet these 
requirements. I will point out one peculiarity that is not 
typical of the tax systems of other countries, but for us it is 
simply mandatory. It is appropriation of an enterprise's extra 
income for its placement in favorable climatic conditions (one 
of the kinds of differential rents). In the world practice a 
differential rent is not calculated separately and is included 
in enterprise's income, therefore is appropriated only partially 
within the limits of tax on profit. But the world does not have 
other countries comparable to Russia in terms of territorial 
size. Differential rents manifest themselves in the income from 
foreign trade of southern countries with those in the north 
because of lower costs of agricultural products. 
  A transition from the prevailing old system of financial 
regulation of economic activities by planned targets to 
management where economic (market) principles become 
increasingly predominant constitutes the main contents of the 
reforms began in 1985. Their goal is to shift to profit as the 
criterion of activities, and by providing a combination of 
centralized administration and market regulation to expand the 
principles of self-financing not only for territorial entities 
(oblasts, republics). 
  [Voronchikhin] This means that today a lot depends on the 
competent actions of bodies of state administration? 
  [Melentyev] Modern practice demands a transition from a 
rigid 
planning, lessening, and reduction of this function of central 
bodies, to strict measures of financial regulation. The old 
system of economic management could not make serious demands on 
the financial sphere. For instance, the prices enterprises 
charged for their products did not necessarily cover the costs, 
since what was demanded of enterprises was first and foremost to 
fulfill the plan. The all-national economic 
balance--distribution of the output produced--was carried out 
only at the top level; at the bottom, the disbalance was covered 
by subsidies. In the new environment, state administration 
bodies have to create for all economic entities an adequate 
economic and legal environment. It is characterized by a fair 
tax system, setting up a mechanism of mutual responsibility 
between enterprises and financial bodies, maintaining equivalent 
circulation, and timely banking and credit clearing. 
  [Voronchikhin] You were talking about climatic conditions; I 
assume you had in mind northern allowances and the Siberian 
coefficient?.. 
  [Melentyev] The process of expanding the regulating role of 
the state with the help of economic elements of administration 
(prices for the output of monopolist enterprises, taxes, 
credits, etc.) have their special peculiarities in our country 
because of its great territory and sharp differences in natural 
and climatic conditions. This peculiarity requires equalizing 
the operating environment across the regions. People living in 
the regions with harsher climate spend more on warm clothing and 
food. Also of considerable importance is that consumer goods are 
more expensive here as well. This means that wages in these 
regions must be higher than in the south. A man, no matter in 
what region he lives, should get for the same labor the wages 
that would provide him with the same standard of living. 
  Until now the state regulated the factor of such 
differentials in the form of centrally set territorial 
coefficients to base wages. In addition, prices for enterprises' 
output also were centrally differentiated by region: in the 
south they were lower, and in the north, higher. This way 
differential rent was appropriated and production environment 
was equalized across the regions. In modern market relations 
most prices are set either by the market or by regional rather 
than central bodies. As is known, prices in any market have a 
tendency to equalize. For instance, during V. Chernomyrdin's 
visit to the Far East in August of last year, a demand was made 
to set electric power rates there at the same level as in the 
rest of Russia. But with prices the same on average across the 
regions, the differential rent ends up in the southerners' 
income. This is not fair since this income is not associated 
directly with the labor expenditures of those who have 
appropriated this income in a disguised form. 
  Now the state function of factoring territorial differences 
is narrowed down and includes only entities financed out of the 
federal budget. For economically independent enterprises the 
principle of factoring regional costs and deduction of 
differential rent must be determined differently. 
  [Voronchikhin] How? 
  [Melentyev] Wages are an element of enterprises' costs. 
Therefore, those located in harsher climatic conditions 
objectively will have higher costs at least because of higher 
wages. In addition, harsh climate requires greater use of 
electric power, fuels, additional costs... This means that 
enterprises in the north will produce more expensive products 
that are not competitive with those produced by enterprises in 
the south. I do not have to explain the consequences. 
  You cannot place the entire population in the square 
adjacent 
to the White House. It is in the interest of the state to 
distribute the population across the entire territory of the 
country. Therefore, wages must be differentiated, while 
enterprises' income must be equalized in accordance with the 
principle of social justice. The proposal is very simple: to 
introduce a federal tax on land; [column line missing] in the 
north it will be lower. The difference between the level of 
taxes must cover the additional expenses incurred in the north 
because of the harsh climatic conditions and the distance from 
industrially developed centers. 
  [Voronchikhin] As many centuries of Russian history show us, 
the issue of land is one of the most difficult to resolve. 
Perhaps taxes would provide that very tool with the help of 
which this delicate problem at least may be regulated less 
painfully? 
  [Melentyev] The impact of this tax is multifaceted. First, 
it 
provides an incentive for enterprises not to halt production, 
because this tax always has to be paid, even when the enterprise 
has no output. Second, it provides an incentive for prudent land 
use, because this use is not free. The aforementioned principle 
of equalizing production conditions sharply diminishes the need 
to develop a system of prices for transportable products 
produced by monopolist enterprises that are differentiated by 
zones, because a regional differential from the average national 
price will be determined by the difference in selling and 
transportation costs in deliveries between regions. Besides, 
land tax is more stable than prices. After all, its level does 
not depend on the changing state of the market and other 
operational environment. 
  Establishing such a tax is not a goal in itself--it is an 
element of improving the system of financial regulation of 
economic activities. The main principle of the tax policy should 
be as follows: Only after fulfilling the equalizing function 
with the help of regionally differentiated land-use rent can a 
unified principle of taxation by other factors be ensured. 
  [Voronchikhin] A regional tax differential probably should 
be 
scientifically substantiated, pass the expert evaluation of the 
Federal Assembly, and be codified in law, should it not? 
  [Melentyev] Unfortunately, the idea of a regional tax 
differential makes headway with great difficulty and sometimes 
degenerates into foreign forms. Instead of differentiating taxes 
as such, the share of contribution into local and federal 
budgets is differentiated. This situation creates a basis for 
bureaucratic arbitrariness with very familiar rules: to give or 
not to give; how much to give and how much to take? [Word 
missing] for instance, the republics of Chechnya, Yakutia, 
Bashkortostan, and Tatarstan transfer the entire revenue from 
the value-added tax into local budgets; some oblasts transfer 20 
percent, and some, 50 percent. Apparently, what is behind it is 
not economic calculation but rather the level of noise produced 
by statements of their sovereignty. 
  [Voronchikhin] Is this not why other federation components 
before the adoption of the new constitution so actively demanded 
republic status? 
  [Melentyev] Most likely. Keeping in mind the caution of 
federal authorities in this delicate business--what share of 
taxes to give up to the federal budget--it becomes necessary to 
set custom duties for one or another republic or oblast with 
respect to the import and export of products. The level of 
"import" duties should exactly correspond to the value of 
differential rents charged. 
  For instance, Russia does not produce citrus fruit or 
grapes; 
this means that import of these products should be duty-free. 
But when we import what we make ourselves, we should apply the 
tax--in order to equalize the economic conditions of production, 
to protect domestic producers. Hence, the slogan of a single 
economic space that is currently being touted by the presidents 
of the CIS southern republics is unsuitable for Russia. Just as 
Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova have the right to purchase our gas 
or other goods in their own way, on different terms. 
  Implementing the principles described above to construct a 
regional differential federal tax system finally will allow 
liquidation of the statute on unsubsidized development of the 
northern territories, or at least reduce the subsidies to 
one-time events, that is, temporary state subventions 
(development-aimed incentive subsidies). We have to hurry, 
because economic contradictions between regions and injustice 
usually result in social tension...

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Matochkin, Kaliningrad Oblast </F>
administration chief, by Eduard Govorushko, under rubric "The 
Economy, Numbers, Analyses, Society": "Why Not Create a Baltic 
Republic?"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Yuriy Semyonovich Matochkin, born 1931, doctor 
of economic science, member of the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly. Kaliningrad old-timer. Cruised the Baltic and the 
Atlantic as a navigator and later captain of large ships, was 
chairman of a fishing kolkhoz. After receiving his doctorate 
became president of one of Kaliningrad's institutes. Appointed 
chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast administration in August 1991. 
Says that he will not leave his position until he creates a 
normative and legal basis for the development of the Yantar 
[Amber] Free Economic Zone. 
  [Govorushko] Yuriy Semyonovich, is it easy for the oblast to 
be a Russian enclave? 
  [Matochkin] A component of the Russian Federation. But 
unfortunately, not everyone in the government understands what 
it means to live two countries away from Moscow. The problems 
that arise during transit through Lithuania are known and, on 
the whole, understood. But suddenly we learned that, the same as 
last year, our own Ministry of Railways introduced international 
freight rates for us... And we had thought, naively, that the 
question had been settled once and for all. 
  In general, we can only hope that it will be recognized at 
all governmental levels: there is a foreign territory of the 
Russian Federation. Any document signed with the Baltic states, 
Belarus or other of the oblast's neighbors--even for 
intra-Russian use--must take our geopolitical situation and 
interests into account. But sometimes Russia forgets about us. 
  [Govorushko] So it seems that most of the problems for the 
oblast are created not by Lithuania or other adjoining states, 
but by the Russian government itself? 
  [Matochkin] No, I wouldn't say that. Lithuania creates 
problems, but it would be easier to resolve them if Russia 
helped actively. Because Lithuania, as a sovereign state, quite 
justifiably is interested in negotiating at the national level, 
regarding dialog with us as merely preparing the ground. 
  [Govorushko] Why not give the oblast greater authority in 
negotiating with its neighbors? 
  [Matochkin] We count on this happening after passage of the 
law on the status of Kaliningrad Oblast, which the Russian Duma 
is to consider soon. But there had never been any enclaves in 
Russian history, so we can only guess what the deputies will 
think of the bill. A new statute for the oblast is only a first 
step. In future I do not preclude formation of a Baltic Russian 
Republic, in the framework of a single state. I think the 
administration chief or governor--the name doesn't 
matter--should be appointed by the president so as to stress 
that the region is inseparable from Russia. The president's 
vicegerent should be authorized to negotiate with neighboring 
countries on all the territory's problems. Incidentally, the 
government has given me such authority with regard to the 
northeastern provinces of Poland. 
  We would like to use the future status law to become, for 
example, an associate member of the community of Baltic and 
northern states, representing Russian interests there. This 
process has already begun in some measure. I came to this 
conclusion after a meeting of officials of the Baltic region in 
Helsinki, in which I took part as a member of the Russian 
delegation. But so far our relations with Poland are developing 
more dynamically. Yet we would gladly accede to an understanding 
on, say, a non-visa regime for inhabitants of the three Baltic 
states. Besides, restoration of a new type of Hanseatic Union 
would be impossible without Kaliningrad Oblast, its ports and 
transit routes as a connecting link between East and West. 
  [Govorushko] What is the socio-economic situation in the 
oblast? Did it gain anything from the free economic zone status? 
  [Matochkin] Actually, benefits for the free economic zone 
began to accrue only since the first quarter of last year. At 
the same time, due to high transportation costs per unit of 
output produced in the oblast, it is not competitive. That is 
why the rate of decline of production in industry and 
agriculture is higher than the average for Russia. At the same 
time, customs benefits for the free economic zone stimulated 
external economic ties and led to increased investment in 
construction, which is higher here than the all-Russia average. 
Trade and commodity reserves have increase substantially. The 
rate of price increases is lower than in the country: at present 
Kaliningrad is among the cities where goods and services are 
cheaper. The difference between the living minimum and average 
income has changed for the better. Small and medium businesses 
and tourism are developing actively, and many small private 
enterprises are being set up. The oblast now holds third place 
in Russia for foreign investment, after Moscow and St. 
Petersburg. 
  This year, however, began with difficulty, as in the entire 
country. It can't be helped: we get 90 percent of our 
supplementaries from the Russian Federation. The oblast remains 
subsidized, and will continue to be for a long time. We depend 
in many ways on the federal budget, which owes us 18 billion 
rubles for last year, while in the first quarter we didn't get a 
kopeck of 14 billion. What saves us, once again, is the free 
zone regime and the additional regional quota for exports of our 
own oil. This has helped build up small hard-currency reserves, 
on which we live, and we also invest in development of the 
infrastructure. 
  [Govorushko] The forced militarization of the oblast, as far 
as I know, not only complicates relations with Baltic countries 
but is also, probably, a deadweight on the economy? 
  [Matochkin] Our relations with Lithuania and Poland are not 
affected by this, though inter-governmental relations certainly 
are. But the population of the oblast supports the army and 
feels safer in its presence. From the economic, social and 
ecological aspects the armed forces are indeed a heavy burden on 
the oblast, something which ranking bureaucrats also sometimes 
fail to understand. In addition, relations between the army and 
local governments are another blank spot in our legislation. I 
can say that cuts in the armed forces of the region are already 
taking place, but the strategic interests of the state will not 
suffer. 
  [Govorushko] Does the name of the erstwhile all-union 
headman 
trouble the oblast? 
  [Matochkin] Of course. We don't know how to get rid of it 
yet, or how to call this now Russian city. Besides, we have many 
more important problems: energy resources, food, transportation, 
in short, at present there is no time for renamings and removing 
communist monuments. On the other hand, we are seriously 
considering reconstructing the historical image of the oblast 
center and other cities and towns. 
  For this we are planning to build plants based on Italian 
technology in the near future to manufacture high-quality bricks 
and durable roof tile. 
  [Govorushko] I can't help asking about the "secrets and 
mysteries" of Kaliningrad Oblast: flooded German plants, 
attempts to locate the Amber Room... 
  [Matochkin] No one has either confirmed or refuted the 
legends about flooded aircraft plants in the Mamonovo area, 
because so far it has been impossible to discover where the 
flooded area connects with the bay. The mistake was that no 
serious investigation of the territory in connection with 
secrets of the Reich was ever undertaken and things were left to 
drift. Now interest in all this has subsided. Interest in the 
Amber Room is periodically rekindled, in particular in 1991, 
when a major operation was undertaken with the participation of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Not long ago the Germans, 
together with the Japanese, proposed undertaking a search with 
the help of state-of-the-art equipment, but so far we have not 
yet defined the legal basis of such a search or the fate of 
future finds.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Boris Prokhorov: "Our Situation Is </F>
Desperate. But the Way Out Is Through Unity, Not Confrontation. 
That Is What the Stavropol Kray Trade Union Aktiv Decided After 
Discussing the Economic Situation in the Region"] 
  [Text] Yevgeniy Kuznetsov, head of the Stavropol Kray 
administration, met with executives of the kray trade union 
council and trade union activists. He told them about the state 
of the economy. It is, alas, catastrophic. Mainly because of the 
reformist center's radicalism. 
  The time has come to conclude a tripartite agreement between 
the executive power, the employers, and the trade unions. The 
main link--the employers--proved to be the least reliable. They 
are no longer subordinate to anyone, while the authorities, as 
the governor conceded, no longer have any levers of control over 
their territory. 
  What does such excessive independence lead to? Let us take 
the example of Neftekumsk Rayon. Before it produced 7.2 million 
tonnes of oil, now it extracts barely 1.2-1.5 million. It is 
high time for municipal ownership to take over the oilfields. 
But no, their managers, with support from the center, resist: 
This is ours, don't dare to intervene, these aren't "the old 
days." 
  Now the rayon is on the verge of a strike. The entire 
responsibility for the social protection of its inhabitants has 
shifted to the executive power, while the main culprits--the 
no-good industrial managers--remain on the sidelines. 
  Nor do the trade unions have their former influence over the 
employers, especially in the new, post-reform structures. The 
managerial corps is running loose, setting unthinkable salaries 
for themselves and their associates, while defrauding and 
hurting the workers. The people's lack of legal rights is 
crowned by arbitrariness. 
  Perhaps saddest of all is that now there is no political 
force in the kray capable of influencing the public frame of 
mind. Numerous dwarf parties are up to their ears in political 
squabbles. The executive power's only hope is the trade unions 
as a more or less organized force. 
  Moreover, it should be recognized openly that these are all 
not just Stavropol's problems. Rather, they are an exact 
reflection of the situation in the country: Working people no 
longer demand higher wages and lower prices, all they demand is 
that the government pay off its own debts for work long since 
done and produce shipped. 
  What we see both here and in the villages is: Last harvest's 
grain and sugar beet have still not shipped and everything is 
rotting on kolkhoz threshing-floors. Wool, too. It turns out 
that it is more profitable for the state to import wool from 
Australia and sugar from Canada than to produce its own. The 
country's only sheep and goat breeding scientific-research 
institute has closed down. Elite herds and flocks have been 
slaughtered. 
  The situation is much the same in all of Russia's granaries. 
For example, in Orenburg Oblast they also reduced agricultural 
production to a minimum; all that is left is for their own 
needs. But the Orenburg people at least have a powerful 
industry, which the Stavropol country doesn't have. The kray is 
fully dependent on the center. 
  Because of this the governor asked the trade union officials 
to assume public control over food production and the use of 
various social protection funds. 
  Nevertheless, in response to their questions Yevgeniy 
Semyonovich displayed optimism. 
  "I don't agree that everything is going totally wrong. A new 
society is forming. There is a glimmer of hope that the economy 
will be renovated. Housing construction is proceeding at the 
same rate. Construction of a local oil refinery is in the works, 
and a rare-earth metals mine is planned. The administration is 
doing everything to prevent total failure." 
  As for calls for the government to resign and the formation 
of a "government of popular trust," in Kuznetsov's view, "It is 
foolish, a new spiral of politicking. Doubtlessly, there are 
forces in the country who would like to fish in the muddied 
waters of unbridled radicalism. 
  "We had before us the example of China, which has achieved 
the expansion of its economy without overreaching, but we didn't 
make use of it. Figuratively speaking, now it's not the Chinese 
but we who have made the 'great leap' into the market. And it 
looks like we've landed in a deep puddle." 
  The administration is now sustained only by pride, 
understanding that it must lead the kray out of the dead end. 
"There's no one else to do it," Kuznetsov says. A bitter but 
honest admission. 
  Trade union officials asked the administration chief many 
questions. For example: How were low-income people to pay 
heating bills? What is being done to restore collapsed health 
care in the villages? Will losses suffered from a hailstorm in 
Novoselitskiy Rayon be covered? 
  The governor asked for the trade unions' help. For example, 
it was necessary to place the targeted distribution of subsidies 
to low-income people under public control, establish control 
over property insurance for kolkhozes and private farmers so as 
to prevent them from being helpless in the face of natural 
disasters, and so forth. 
  It occurred to me that many of those questions would have 
been resolved long ago if only V. Krasulya, deputy chief of the 
kray administration, who oversees them, would view the trade 
unions as his allies, and not as opponents of his ultraradical 
"democratic" views. But everyone knows that he refuses to visit 
the kray trade union council! 
  The trade union activists were, understandably, concerned 
when the unceremonious administrative interference in internal 
trade union affairs would finally end. Why do departments 
subordinate to V. Krasulya devote such great efforts to breaking 
up the kray's trade unions rather than strengthening them? They 
resort to administrative instructions, hatching of intrigues... 
  "Brush off whoever encroaches on your affairs," the governor 
said. "Of course, one can't expect peace and accord between 
trade unions and the executive power. They are bound to worry 
one another. But only in the interests of the working people, 
not to their detriment. Every rayon administration chief who 
promotes confrontation between the authorities and the largest 
public organization will be held responsible to me personally." 
  On the whole, the meeting was surprisingly useful and 
constructive. The trade union aktiv saw a leader deeply 
concerned with the kray's fate. It is really hard for him today. 
Isn't that also the concern of his partners? That means the 
executive power and the trade unions should become allies. 
  In hard times it is necessary to give the kray executive 
authorities worker support, that was the result of the entire 
meeting. It seems that in Stavropol both sides have mastered 
this simple truth. It would be good if it finally reached the 
center.

<F P=106> [Survey prepared by S. Pautova: "One Cannot Become </F>
Richer by Lowering Production." The survey is under the rubric 
"Economics in the Mirror of Statistics. How They Made It Through 
the Year." 
  [Text] People's standard of living, for the most 
part, is not determined primarily by how revenues are divided 
up, but by the amounts that go into the budget. And this depends 
directly on total amounts earned by industry. 
  The information presented here is based on data 
provided by the Municipal Directorate of Statistics. 
  Last year, 1993, the production output of industrial 
enterprises in our city totaled 1,400 billion rubles at then 
current prices, the value of which was 8.3 times greater than 
the 1992 output. But in terms of comparative prices, the total 
production output of industrial enterprises decreased by 5.8 
percent (if the total for 1992 is compared to that of 1991, the 
difference would be 16.6 percent). 
  More than half (that is, 64 percent) of the Novokusnetsk 
enterprises lowered their outputs of industrial products. Among 
them were the Kuznetskiy Metallurgical Combine (KMK) Joint Stock 
Company (for 1993, this combine's output was 86 percent of 1992 
production); the Novokuznetskaya Mine (89 percent); the 
Polosukhinskaya Joint Stock Company (71 percent); the 
Bungurskaya Joint Stock Company (88 percent); the Taldinskiy 
Open Pit Mine (80 percent); and the Viakom Joint Stock 
Company--the new name for the former meat combine (75 percent). 
  At the same time, the decrease in the number of persons 
employed in the city's industrial enterprises in 1993 was 
insignificant. The city's enterprises employed 111,565 people 
(or, 99.4 percent of those employed in 1992). Labor 
productivity, however, fell by 5.3 percent. 
  And now, some words about the dynamics of producing the main 
kinds of goods in Novokuznetsk enterprises. In 1993, for 
example, 9.5 percent less coal was extracted than in 1992. This 
sharp decrease in extraction can be explained by the inability 
of users to pay for the coal, caused mainly by the higher costs 
of transportation services. Certain enterprises were forced to 
halt coal mining completely. Thus in June 1993, the 
Zaryanovskaya Mine did not extract any coal, and the 
Baydayevskaya Mine brought out only 0.7 thousand tonnes 
(compared to the May output of 49.1 thousand tonnes). 
  The output of the most important products in the 
metallurgical industry increased, compared to 1992: From rolled 
metal (by 7.1 percent), to agglomerate (by 10.4 percent), to 
cast iron (by 3.6 percent), and steel (by 3.0 percent). For the 
most part, all this production was the result of work done by 
the Zapadno-Sibirskiy Metallurgical Combine Joint Stock Company. 
In addition to the afore-mentioned KMK Joint Stock Company, two 
other metallurgical enterprises decreased their production of 
basic metal materials: The production of aluminum was 98.3 
percent of the 1992 level and ferroalloys were 97 percent. 
  Speaking of 1993 totals for industry, it must be noted that 
compared to 1992, the rates of decrease for volume of production 
have slowed down somewhat. 
  Still, the percent by which production has decreased remains 
large. This is due to the inability of consumers to pay for 
products made in the city, increased costs of transportation, 
lack of raw materials, and sharp increase in the costs of all 
forms of energy. 
  With regard to the food branch of the city's industry, 
products for which there is a specific and fairly stable demand 
have also been affected by the overall trend of a continuing 
decrease in output. The output for whole milk was 77 percent, 
compared to 1992; meat--67 percent; bread and bakery 
products--88 percent; and confectioner products--82 percent. 
  On the whole, production of consumer goods shrank by 14.8 
percent in 1993. 
  Still, the data for 1993 alone do not provide any 
understanding about the "abyss" in which our economy finds 
itself. Let us, therefore, compare the dynamics of average daily 
production of basic goods for the past four years--from 1990 
through 1993. 
  The most important output of the city's metallurgical 
complex 
consists of rolled metal, cast iron, and steel. The daily 
average output of cast iron fell from 28.131 thousand tonnes in 
1990 to 19.025 in 1993 (18.32 in 1992). The average daily output 
of steel decreased from 32.61 thousand tonnes in 1990 to 21.72 
in 1993 (which is somewhat higher than the 1992 figure). Sharp 
decreases also occurred in rolled metal: From a daily average 
output of 22.34 thousand tonnes in 1990 to 16.39 in 1993. 
  While the metallurgical branch showed a definite, though 
insignificant, increase in its daily average output in 1992, the 
coal industry showed a different trend. In 1992 the daily 
average output of coal decreased by 12.34 thousand tonnes and in 
1993 it fell by nearly 5 thousand tonnes, to 44.65 thousand 
tonnes. Similar trends can be seen in the output of construction 
materials. Here are the figures for the average daily production 
of cement in 1990, 1992, and 1993: 3.616, 2.45, and 1.99 
thousand tonnes, respectively. The drop in prefabricated 
reinforced concrete was even greater--from 1.316 thousand cubic 
meters per day in 1990 to 0.4 thousand in 1993. The output of 
aluminum and electrical energy decreased in the city, although 
the rate of decrease was not quite so significant. 
  The general trends did not bypass the production of 
foodstuffs either. The daily average output of whole milk in 
1990 was 334.3 tonnes. In 1993 the figure was down to 106.05 
tonnes. It is doubtful that this decrease of more than two 
thirds in the output of a valuable product that is needed daily 
is attributable solely to the increase in its cost. 
  This is also obvious in the dynamics of bread production and 
pastry products. There is also a decrease here, from 162.76 
tonnes per day in 1990 to 143.34 in 1993. Because of this we see 
constant queues in bakeries. 
  Understandably, our city has contributed its share to the 
rising inflationary spiral. The decrease in the output of the 
basic types of products invariably reflects both on price 
increases and on the inflation level, as well as on the standard 
of living in general. We cannot become richer if we produce and 
sell less and less.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The North: A Milking Cow Has To Be </F>
Fed--Norilsk Loved People, Why Has It Fallen Out of Love?"] 
  [Text] Before you is a photocopy of an article published 
six years ago, on April 6, 1988, in the newspaper 
SOTSIALISTICHESKAYA INDUSTRIYA. In it, our special correspondent 
Edgar Elyashchev told about the life and work of polar Norilsk, 
about what the city and its mining and metallurgical combine are 
doing for people. We are not going to retell the lengthy 
account, which was rich in facts and figures. 
  We will only repeat the most important thing, something that 
was very aptly expressed in the article's headline, "Norilsk 
Loves People." In that city, in the extreme conditions of the 
Far North, everything possible was done to ease for working 
families the concerns and hardships that made their lives 
difficult and to protect and strengthen people's health. 
  Year after year, Norilsk increased capital investments in 
the 
social sphere. 
  "If this pace is maintained for another five to seven years, 
life here will be completely normal by that time," Boris 
Ivanovich Kolesnikov, general director of the Norilsk Zavenyagin 
Mining and Metallurgical Combine, told the journalist. 
  That period of time has now passed. But instead of a 
"completely normal" life, there is crisis, poverty, and alarm. 
As is the case throughout the North, the situation in Norilsk is 
utterly desperate. Workers at the plants and mines are on the 
brink of holding mass protests. They sent a representative 
delegation to Moscow in hopes of seeing high-level officials 
with the help of the Russian Federation of Independent Trade 
Unions. 
  The group of trade-union officials and leaders of the 
council 
of labor collectives visited the editorial offices of RABOCHAYA 
TRIBUNA. The guests gave us a package of documents addressed to 
the authorities, and here is what they told us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Norilsk Industrial Managers: "A Giant on Its </F>
Knees Can No Longer Shoulder Burden"] 
  [Text] Anatoliy Artemenko, deputy chairman of the 
Federation of Taymyr Trade Unions Executive Committee: 
  The combine's industrial production fell by 25 percent last 
year alone. In order to bring the workforce into conformity with 
production volumes, we have to lay off approximately 37,000 
people. To this we must add 30,000 retirees who are condemned to 
live in the Norilsk industrial zone because they don't have 
enough money to move back to the "mainland." As a result of the 
Gaydar reform, the money they had saved for retirement or for a 
rainy day became worthless overnight. After all, the cost of 
living in the North is much higher than in the country's central 
regions. 
  They have all become hostages to the North. 
  Anatoliy Gluskin, member of the combine's council of 
labor collectives: 
  The Norilsk Nickel Concern, of which our combine is a part, 
the Krasnoyarsk Nonferrous Metals Plant, and two enterprises on 
the Kola Peninsula were once known as the flagship of the 
ferrous metals industry. There is no other combine in Russia 
like it. We accounted for up to 90 percent of all nickel and 
cobalt, 30 percent of all copper, and 50 percent of world 
extraction of platinum and platinoids. But now the question of 
the Norilsk Combine's very survival has arisen. 
  The combine was always extremely profitable. Our profit 
margin was triple that of the gold-mining industry. We export 
100,000 tonnes of nickel. But the problem is that 40 percent of 
our exports are intercepted by Moscow. Precious metals are also 
a total state monopoly. That's hundreds of millions of dollars 
more. At the same time, we experience constant delays in getting 
paid. And the banks are imposing more and more penalties for 
late payments. 
  People came to Norilsk to earn money. A man, a heart 
patient, 
comes up to me and says that the doctor has ordered him to 
return to the "mainland" immediately. Otherwise he won't 
survive. He had 23,000 rubles in his savings account. Three 
years ago, he could have bought himself an apartment and a car. 
Today that money isn't even enough to buy a ticket to Moscow. 
  We are like voluntary prisoners. 
  Boris Degtyarev, chairman of the Norilsk Design 
Institute's trade union: 
  We been making the rounds of government offices in Moscow 
for 
a week now. We tell officials that the North is a big place, 
with 11 million people. There are dozens and hundreds of 
enterprises there. But there are only a handful like the Norilsk 
Combine. We tell them that in order for the law on the North to 
be effective, there has to be a system of priorities as to who 
should be helped first. 
  If necessary, production has to be cut back. Some of the 
people who lose their jobs have to have a guaranteed opportunity 
to move to inhabited areas. What are the region's other unique 
characteristics? The Ukrainian diaspora alone accounts for 15 
percent of the total population. These people became unwanted 
overnight. How can a person return today to Ukraine or 
Kazakhstan, for example? Every republic has its own laws. An 
intergovernmental agreement is needed here. These people worked 
for Russia too, and so Russia must play a part in providing 
their pensions. That's one thing. 
  Second, there has to be strict implementation of the 
government decrees that have been adopted. The government 
recently issued a decree that seems pretty good at first 
glance--"On Appropriating Interest-Free Subsidies for Housing 
Construction." But again, government officials, without 
consulting Northerners but sitting in their offices in Moscow 
with no knowledge of our unique situation, wrote that you can 
obtain the subsidies only by quitting your job in the North and 
moving to the place where you intend to live. That's laughable. 
Who is going to give you a loan in a region that is itself eking 
out a semi-impoverished existence? 
  Gennadiy Bondarenko, chairman of the Metallurgists 
Trade Union: 
  When the collective sent us to Moscow, people hoped that we 
would be able to air our problems at the state level. We were 
able to see Shakhray only on the sixth day. He heard us out 
attentively and then turned us over to his aides. They, in turn, 
sent us to the State Duma, and there we were told to see the 
regional deputies faction. And that's all we've been able to do 
so far. 
  Aleksandr Danilov, chairman of the Oktyabr Mine council 
of labor collectives: 
  Today's difficulties are the result of old mistakes. The 
basic cause is that the social infrastructure is too big. Some 
263,000 workers and office employees live in the Norilsk 
industrial region. Of them, 126,000 are employed by the Norilsk 
Combine. Of those 126,000 employees, 45,000 are our basic work 
force--the miners and metallurgists. So it turns out that 
137,000 are people whose salaries are paid from the budget. They 
even outnumber the combine's employees. 
  The combine cannot support such a large number of people, if 
only because production volumes are certain to drop. Fifty 
percent of everything that is shipped into the territory is paid 
for with hard currency and proceeds from the sale of metal 
produced by the combine. 
  Most of our output is sold by the state. We are permitted to 
sell our products only within the country. We were among the 
first 10 of the second 100 enterprises that acquired licenses to 
sell their own output. 
  In conclusion, it can be said that there is no effective 
state program to develop the Norilsk industrial zone.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Official Information: The Norilsk </F>
Industrial Region and What It Means to Russia"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Climate and Environment. </H5>
  The Norilsk industrial region is situated on the territory 
of 
the Taymyr (Dolgano-Nenets) Autonomous Okrug. 
  The average annual temperature is -9.8 degrees; in January 
and February the temperature can dip to -54 to -57 degrees. 
  Air oxygen content is 20 percent less than in the country's 
middle latitudes. 
  The region is an environmental distress zone, as emissions 
of 
sulfurous gas alone into the atmosphere amounted to almost 2 
million tonnes in 1993. On some days, the concentration of gas 
in residential areas exceeds the maximum allowable level by 30 
to 50 times. As a result, 50 to 70 percent of the employees of 
subdivisions of the Norilsk Combine suffer from various chronic 
illnesses. 
<H5>  Transportation and Costs. </H5>
  Goods are delivered primarily by water (via the Northern Sea 
Route and the Yenisei during the navigation season), as well as 
by motor vehicle. Several-day delays in aircraft flights owing 
to adverse weather conditions result in the Norilsk industrial 
region's complete isolation. 
  A two- to three-fold increase in charges by the Murmansk 
Shipping Line in 1994 made delivery charges comparable to or 
even greater than the value of the cargo itself. 
  The cost of an airplane ticket to Moscow has risen from 15 
to 
45 percent of the average Norilsk resident's pay. When a family 
of four goes on vacation, there is not enough vacation to buy 
tickets for everyone. 
  As a result of the unchecked increases in transportation 
costs, food prices are rising rapidly. Up to 60 percent of all 
Norilsk residents are forced to spend almost the entire family 
income on food. 
<H5>  Geography and Politics. </H5>
  The region is administratively subordinate to Krasnoyarsk 
Kray, but it is not economically linked with Krasnoyarsk. This 
artificial administrative association represents a historical 
anachronism dating from the breakup of the GULAG system in 1953. 
  The kray allocated 15 percent of all local taxes to Norilsk 
in 1992 and 28 percent in 1993. As a result, the Norilsk Combine 
is forced to maintain the local infrastructure and housing at 
its own expense. 
  It would be useful to make the Norilsk industrial region 
subordinate to federal authorities or to transfer it to the 
Taymyr Autonomous Okrug, with taxes to be left at the okrug's 
disposal. 
<H5>  Industry. </H5>
  The industrial region's main enterprise is the Norilsk 
Mining 
and Metallurgical Combine, which includes mining, enrichment, 
and metallurgical production facilities. In addition to the main 
production facilities, there are also enterprises producing 
construction materials and structural elements, a high-capacity 
construction association, an autonomous power system, research 
and design organizations, and trade, public catering, and 
food-industry enterprises. The combine includes the Dudinka sea 
and river port, which handles up to 6 million tonnes of cargo 
annually, a well-developed network of warehouses and storage 
facilities, a railroad, and motor vehicle transport and 
passenger services. 
  The combine's housing and municipal-services balance sheet 
contains more than 5 million square meters of housing, more than 
100 preschool facilities, 53 schools, hospitals, and other 
social-structure facilities in the cities of Norilsk, Talny, 
Kayerkan, Oganer, and Dudinka. 
  The combine employs a total of almost 137,000 people, more 
than 127,000 of them in the Norilsk industrial region. The 
region's total population is about 260,000. 
  The combine produces the bulk of Russia's nonferrous metals, 
including 80 to 90 percent of its nickel, 30 percent of its 
copper, 80 percent of its cobalt, and almost 100 percent of its 
platinum and platinoids (almost 50 percent of world production). 
In 1993 it exported for state needs alone 40,000 tonnes of 
nickel, 50,000 tonnes of copper, with budget revenues exceeding 
$156 million. 
  A drop in or halt to production at the Norilsk Combine would 
have catastrophic consequences for the economy of the Norilsk 
industrial region and Russia as a whole.

<F P=106> [Article, under the rubric "Statistics," in two installments </F>
by Nikolay Kivchun, director of the RF State Statistics 
Committee Sakhalin Educational Center: "What Is Happening in the 
Field of Industry"] 
<H5>  [12 Feb p 4] </H5>
  [Text] As analysis of statistical data shows, the situation 
in Sakhalin Oblast may be characterized as extremely serious. In 
order to show this clearly, I will cite data for 1993 from the 
oblast statistical administration. 
  Thus, according to the data, on 1 January 1994 there were 
8,792 economic subjects registered on the territory of Sakhalin 
Oblast. 
  There were 565 commercial organizations, including state 
enterprises; 128 municipal organizations; 1,689 individual 
organizations (family and private); 269 open-type joint stock 
companies; 3,119 closed-type joint stock companies and limited 
partnerships; 1,033 peasant and private farms; and 299 
production cooperatives. 
  Among noncommercial organizations, there were 526 state 
institutions and 93 public associations. 
  It is obvious from the figures cited that the oblast's 
economy has fundamentally changed; it has become a market 
economy. Whereas before the reforms, there used to be three 
forms of ownership--state, kolkhoz-cooperative, and personal, 
now different organizational forms and enterprises have 
appeared, and in choosing any one of them, they become free and 
independent. That is exactly what is required for a market. 
  In 1993 Sakhalin's industrial enterprises in current prices 
produced 521 billion rubles [R] worth of output (and jobs and 
services); that includes R70.4 billion worth in December, which 
is 6.8 times the same indicators for 1992. 
  The volume of production (in constant prices) declined by 
13.8 percent as compared with last year and by 22.2 percent in 
December. 
  In the processing industry, this indicator declined by 18.1 
percent, while in the chemical, petrochemical, and light 
industries, the figure reached 13-43 percent. In electrical 
power engineering and the petroleum production and coal sectors, 
the decline in production volumes was 11-17 percent, while for 
extraction industry as a whole the figure was 6 percent. 
  Thus, an increase in production can be shown only in 
monetary 
terms. The real volume of production declined and the decline 
has not stopped. 
  The process of destatization of enterprises continued in 
industry throughout 1993. As of 1 October 1993, more than half 
of the industrial enterprises producing more than 60 percent of 
the output were found in the private and mixed forms of 
ownership. 
  Nonstate forms of ownership were most common in sectors such 
as the building materials, light, and food industries. 
  Losses of work time increased; that is above all related to 
the lengthy shutdowns of enterprises and production facilities. 
The greatest losses of work time were typical for enterprises of 
the timber, wood-processing and pulp and paper, light, and food 
industries--96.5 percent of the overall losses. More than half 
of the enterprise shutdowns in December were related to 
difficulties in the marketing of output as well as the 
unavailability of material resources. 
  Of the 125 types of industrial output, the production 
volumes 
for 70 of them declined by 15 percent or more. A significant 
decline occurred in the food and fish (67 percent), light (10), 
and timber, wood-processing, and paper and pulp (8.6 percent) 
industries. 
  A higher volume of production during 1993 was observed for 
26 
types of output. They included cement, wallpaper, certain types 
of furniture, frozen and salted fish, and frozen fillets. 
  In the fuel and energy sectors, in December 1993 an increase 
in extraction (production) was noted for the basic types of 
energy resources; this is typical for the fall-winter period . 
Thus, in January-December, 2.607 billion kilowatt hours of 
electricity were produced (96.1 percent of last year's level); 
3.667 million gigacalories of thermal power (98.2 percent); 
1.6186 billion cubic meters of natural gas; 1.5609 million 
tonnes of oil, including gas concentrate; and 4.23 million 
tonnes of coal. 
  In 1993 as a whole as compared to the previous year, the 
production of oil, including gas concentrate, declined by 6.9 
percent (by 9.1 percent in 1992); of gas--by 6.4 percent (as 
opposed to 8.4 percent in 1992); and of coal--by 6.2 percent (as 
compared to a 3.5 percent increase in 1992). Converted to 
standard units, the extraction and production of all types of 
energy resources declined by 5.9 percent (by 3.7 percent in 
1992). 
<H5>  [19 Feb p 4] </H5>
  [Text] Logging sector enterprises reduced the production of 
commercial timber by 569.2 million cubic meters in 1993; that 
led to a 29-60 percent decline in production of railroad 
crossties and timbers and a 92 percent decline in production of 
factory-built wooden buildings. 
  In the last months of last year, the production of commodity 
cellulose declined sharply--in all only 14,900 tonnes were 
produced, and that is 71.2 percent less than in 1992. A bad 
situation took shape in production of cardboard also; produced 
in December were 260 tonnes, or 11.4 percent of the level of 
that month in 1992. 
  In 1993 light industry enterprises produced 12,300 knitted 
items (92.3 percent) and 216,000 pairs of leather shoes (85.7 
percent). 
  As compared with the previous year, production of shoes 
declined by 14.3 percent; of knitted items--by 7.7 percent; and 
of garments such as raincoats and rainjackets, jackets, suits, 
shirts, and other things--by 26-65 percent. 
  One of the main reasons for the decline in the volume of 
production in this sector is the shortage of inhouse working 
capital resulting from difficulties in marketing output and the 
failure of customers to pay; their indebtedness as of 1 December 
1993 totaled R810 million. 
  Food industry enterprises produced the following: 6,825 
tonnes of meat, including byproducts; 28,143 tonnes of whole 
milk products; 4,595 tonnes of sausage products; and 63,768 
tonnes of bread and bakery goods. The decline in production of 
the products listed above was 16-43 percent. Moreover, changes 
occurred in the structure of the food industry in favor of 
higher priced types: thus, production of smoked items increased 
by 5 percent, while production of thoroughly smoked sausage 
items increased by a factor of 1.8. 
  The fish catch declined by 12 percent as compared to last 
year's level, and that in turn entailed reduced production of 
fish products both overall and for certain variety groups. In 
particular specially dressed fish declined by 55.2 percent and 
culinary items declined by more than half. 
  In only three rayons, Kholmskiy, Kurilskiy, and 
Smirnykhovskiy, was the volume of industrial production above 
the 1992 level. The oblast's other rayons reduced production of 
output, and in eight rayons the drop was as much as 30-60 
percent. 
<H5>  Labor Payment and the Number of Workers in Industry </H5>
  The number of people working in industry totaled 88,375 and 
declined by 8.1 percent as compared to the same period last year. 
  The average wages in November 1993 rose by a factor of 11.9 
as compared with the corresponding period last year. 
  The wages of power engineering workers were 56 percent 
higher 
than the average in industry; of coal miners--44 percent higher; 
and of dairy industry workers--50 percent higher. 
  The number of people working in enterprises with the state 
form of ownership as of 1 October 1993 was 36,150, or 40 percent 
of people working, and their average wages in September were 
R161,232. 
  There were 200 people (0.2 percent) working at enterprises 
with the municipal form of ownership with average wages of 
R45,388. 
  There are 46,943 people, or 54 percent of all people working 
in the oblast's industry, laboring in open-type joint stock 
companies with a mixed form of ownership where the average wages 
in September were R165,076. 
  The number of people working during the first 9 months in 
closed-type joint stock companies with the private form of 
ownership was 2,632 (3 percent), while the average wages in 
September were R160,139. 
  An extremely serious, one might say disastrous, situation 
took shape in the oblast's economy in January 1994. The decline 
in production totaled 34.2 percent, while wholesale prices rose 
by 30.5 percent as compared with December 1993 and 10-fold as 
compared with January 1993. 
  There were 22 enterprises of the timber, wood-processing, 
pulp and paper, and food industries standing idle in Sakhalin in 
January; as a result 18,200 worker-days of work time were lost. 
  Just what are the reasons for this situation? 
  In my opinion, the main reason is that the proportions in 
the 
economy have been disrupted. While changing to the market, we 
have arrived at anarchy and completely discontinued planning and 
forecasting economic development. Even though it is well known 
that in countries where market relations have existed for 
decades, the state does not stop regulating them. 
  A second, quite important reason for the situation which has 
taken shape is that there is no stable, scientifically 
substantiated legislation. Thousands of edicts and decrees which 
contradict one another and do not comply with the Constitution 
are issued. 
  The next trouble is the present tax system. If it is not 
refined, the producer will have no incentive to produce output 
and, consequently, there will be no market. 
  At this time, most of the goods coming to the oblast are 
imported. We export raw materials and create jobs for Japanese, 
South Koreans, and Americans and expect finished output from 
them. But just what are we ourselves supposed to do? 
  And, finally, one of the extremely important reasons for the 
bad situation in the sphere of economics is the psychology of 
our people, who for 70 years were taught not to believe in 
private property, initiative, and entrepreneurship. And now we 
find ourselves in the position of people who have been cast into 
the sea without bothering to find out if we know how to swim or 
not. 
  Of course, time is needed for people to learn how to live 
and 
work in market conditions. And during this transitional period 
all the problems which are arising must be regulated at the 
state level; otherwise the country will be completely dependent 
on foreign capital and lose any kind of independence.

<F P=106> [Interview with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, by N. Batalova: </F>
"We Cannot Leave the People of Sevastopol Alone"; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] We are perhaps only just beginning to comprehend the 
extent of the tragedy. The tragedy of people who, at the whim of 
politicians, have ended up separated from their motherland, 
outside of their own country. It has singed Russians and our 
hometown Muscovites. 
  Recall how proud we were to see points on the map of the 
Union named in honor of the capital. State farms named 
"Moskovskiy" and "Krasnopresnenskiy" were organized on the 
virgin lands of Kazakhstan: it was from Moscow railway stations 
that trainloads of young people departed to develop the virgin 
lands. We were proud that boys at the Moskva frontier post were 
guarding the country's borders. 
  But could the soldiers of the Moskva frontier detachment 
ever 
have expected that the border would cross the hot Tajik-Afghan 
mountains? Could the virgin-land developers have imagined, even 
momentarily, that Moscow and their native Presnya would now be 
in another country? 
  And now, at the center of political, not ocean, storms is 
the 
antisubmarine missile cruiser Moskva, a ship of the Black Sea 
Fleet. Each morning the command is given on board the cruiser, 
as it is on all the ships based in Sevastopol: "Hoist the flag!" 
And the flag of Russia unfurls over the fleet's ships. The 
sailors remain true to their oath of allegiance. To them the 
Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet, just as Sevastopol, city of 
Russian glory and great historical military traditions of the 
Russian state, is a Russian national shrine. 
  Perhaps that is why one of the signs in Sevastopol greeting 
the Moscow delegation headed by Mayor Yu. Luzhkov bore the 
words: "Sevastopol--Moscow--Russia!" The delegation visited the 
city during Fatherland Defenders' Day. We asked Yuriy 
Mikhaylovich Luzhkov to comment on that visit. 
  "First, the purpose of our visit. Our primary purpose was to 
meet with fellow Muscovites, sailors serving on the cruiser 
Moskva. That day we wanted to meet the crew of a ship which for 
many years has been under the patronage of the capital's 
enterprises and organizations whose names include the name 
Moscow. Muscovites fully realize how difficult it is to serve in 
the Black Sea Fleet, how difficult it is today for sailors and 
their families waiting for them on shore, how difficult it is 
for the people of Sevastopol. Our Il-76 plane delivered 30 tons 
of food gifts: sugar, canned meat, products of a Moscow cracker 
and dried lunch plant, cigarettes, toiletries. Personnel of the 
Moskva and Moskovskiy department stores prepared gifts for the 
sailors, officers and children. Our delegation included 
performers, and it was good to see how Moscow artists were 
received on the cruiser and at the Culture House. 
  "In Sevastopol we keenly felt how much such meetings mean to 
people. We spoke with sailors and many inhabitants of the city: 
they spoke frankly of the situation developing in Sevastopol and 
around it. Indeed, how is that, in a city where the majority of 
the population are Russians for whom Russian is their native 
language, all business is conducted in the Ukrainian language 
and the people cannot view Russian TV programs? Currently there 
are only two Russian-language newspapers in Sevastopol, and 
radio broadcasts are also only in Ukrainian. Kindergartens, 
schools and other educational establishments are being 
Ukrainized. The Ukrainian authorities are doing all this 
contrary to the interests and desires of the bulk of the city 
population. 
  "People may say that today Ukraine is an independent country 
with its own state language. But the thing is that Sevastopol is 
a very special city. In conversations with people we felt that 
they cannot conceive of themselves outside of Russia. They 
consider themselves a part of Russia. That is why people here 
respond so keenly and painfully to any injustice or 
ill-considered action of the administration. 
  "Some may not like my words, some may protest, but I must 
say: our delegation gained the impression that the Ukrainian 
authorities were not too eager for us to meet with the people of 
Sevastopol, so the plane's landing was switched several times 
from one airfield to another. 
  "Yet we were traveling to Sevastopol with the best 
intentions. We consider that Russians and Muscovites cannot 
leave the people of Sevastopol alone. They must help them 
resolve vitally important social problems. That is why we 
attended a ceremony to lay the foundation of a 100-apartment 
house, construction of which will be paid for with money 
provided by a Moscow construction complex. Sailors will receive 
housing already this year." 
  "Will apartments in it be offered only to officers from the 
cruiser Moskva?" 
  "Those from our protege cruiser first, of course. But the 
housing problem is so acute for the Black Sea Fleet that 
apartments will also probably be offered to others in need. 
  "But I must say that resolution of the housing problem in 
Sevastopol is aggravated by the fact that politics is 
intervening in such a seemingly essentially public matter. 
Imagine an officer who needs an apartment, but he is a Russian 
officer and serves in the Russian navy; he is a Russian citizen, 
but to get an apartment he must become a Ukrainian citizen, 
because that country doesn't recognize dual citizenship. You can 
imagine what it means for a man of honor and duty to get a 
passport of another country. 
  "I think it is necessary to formulate a special statute for 
Sevastopol. Without that it is impossible to resolve its 
problems and create suitable conditions for the sailors' 
military service. The Russian government must finally say its 
word. After all, the Black Sea Fleet protects the frontiers of 
Russia. It is a guarantor of peace in the Black Sea region. As 
for me, firstly, I will report our delegation's impressions of 
this visit to the president. Secondly, we have already appealed 
to the administration heads of 22 Russian regions whose 
representatives serve on ships and in units of the Black Sea 
Fleet, asking to help the sailors and people of Sevastopol in 
today's hard times: they should constantly feel that Russia is 
concerned for them and will not abandon them. That they are 
Russians."

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Bryachikhin, prefect of Moscow's </F>
Western Administrative District, by Nikolay Andreyev, under "Our 
Life" rubric: "Fair and Square--Is That 50-50? How To Develop a 
Formula To Make It Possible To Move Muscovites Out of 
`Khrushchev Slums'"] 
  [Text] Another major problem has hit Moscow: many of 
the "Khrushchev slums" have long exceeded their designated 
lifetime and living in them is getting not only uncomfortable, 
but simply dangerous. They should be torn down, but that is 
easier said than done: where to get the trillions of rubles 
needed to tear down old houses and build new ones to move people 
into? The capital's lean treasury has no money for such a major 
undertaking, and no help from the federal government is 
forthcoming. Is there no way out? "There is," says A. 
Bryachikhin, prefect of the Western Administrative District. 
  [Andreyev] What are your plans on this score, Aleksey 
Mikheyevich? 
  [Bryachikhin] Why just plans? We try not to talk, but to do 
at least something for real. We have already begun to move 
people out of "Khrushchev slums." Their first occupants will 
celebrate housewarmings in the first half of this year. 
  [Andreyev] Where will they celebrate their housewarmings 
when, as I know, the district receives very little free 
municipal housing, while the waiting list is huge? 
  [Bryachikhin] We are already building new apartment houses 
to 
resettle people from old houses on a commercial basis in the 
Matveyevskoye, Mosfilmovskiy, Solntsevo, and several other 
municipal districts. Twenty thousand square meters of housing 
were built last year, and 200,000 are nearing completion this 
year. I anticipate your next question: "Where do you get the 
money?" We have only one solution: attract investors. Here is 
one example of business cooperation. Construction of new housing 
in a neighborhood in the Fili-Davydkovo municipal district, 
where seventeen 22-story buildings will go up, will be financed 
by the Russian company KONTI, the design was produced by 
Mosproyekt-1 workshop No. 14, and the main subcontractor is the 
Sokoliniye Gory Construction House joint-stock company. We are 
carrying out reconstruction jobs in batches, block by block. 
  [Andreyev] On what terms did you contract the investors? 
  [Bryachikhin] Fair and square: fifty-fifty. The authorities 
contribute land, the investors all the rest: financing, design, 
construction, and ownership. For that the contract assigns them 
half the property--apartments in the new houses, with the other 
half going to us to resettle people from the "Khrushchev slums." 
  [Andreyev] Isn't the cost pretty steep? 
  [Bryachikhin] What can one do if there is no other way out? 
Waiting for the old houses to start collapsing, and, God forbid, 
with human casualties, is simply criminal. 
  [Andreyev] What do you plan to do with the old buildings: 
tear them down or reconstruct or reinforce them? 
  [Bryachikhin] We will only tear them down, because many of 
the buildings of that series simply cannot be reconstructed. As 
for those houses where it might be possible, the cost would be 
higher than new construction. And one more question: who would 
undertake the reconstruction, and how? Builders would not come, 
because new construction is continuous, with high productivity, 
so they earn fairly well. It would hardly be possible to earn as 
much in reconstruction. 
  [Andreyev] So you will just tear down the houses and dump 
the 
rubble? 
  [Bryachikhin] Not at all. We already have the experience of 
the former Sevastopol rayon, where they had begun to tear down 
old buildings. The bathroom fixtures were removed, the panels 
were crushed into gravel, which can be used to build good roads 
or cottages on garden plots. We will do likewise. 
  [Andreyev] I heard of your prefecture's conflict with the 
municipal housing department regarding a new house on 
Michurinskiy Prospekt avenue. Can you explain this? 
  [Bryachikhin] Indeed, our prefecture has filed a suit 
against 
the municipal housing department with the arbitration court. 
Here is the issue: Jointly with the Sovtels firm we built an 
apartment house in the 38th block of the avenue on the following 
conditions: 45 percent of the apartments go to the company, 25 
percent to the subcontractor, and 35 percent to us and the 
district police. We worked together, built the house, and then 
what? The municipal housing department, which had virtually 
nothing to do with the house, took it over and began 
distributing housing as it saw fit. Many want a share... 
  [Andreyev] But that is daytime robbery... 
  [Bryachikhin] There is nothing I can say. I appealed to 
Yuriy 
Mikhaylovich Luzhkov, he instructed the department to return the 
housing. They returned the company's share, but the prefecture 
has still received nothing. Many investors got concerned, and 
one can understand them: is it worth risking, investing huge 
sums, which then may go to the wind? Because of the municipal 
housing department we could not only lose investors, but a vital 
important undertaking may grind to a halt. 
  [Andreyev] Aleksey Mikheyevich, not long ago our paper 
published an item that the mayor had dispatched some kind of 
special commission to your prefecture to check abuses by heads 
of municipal districts and services of the district. Is the 
commission already "digging"? 
  [Bryachikhin] It is quite different. There is indeed a 
commission from the mayor's office in the district, but it is 
here on a regular basis. The government decided to have district 
heads report on the resolution of strategic and current issues 
of servicing the population. They began with us. As for the 
arrest of three district executives, which did take place, only 
the court can decide what violations they committed. The 
investigation is continuing.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Tyagniryadno: "How To Make St. Petersburg </F>
a Safe City"] 
  [Text] Leaders of the preelection bloc Democratic Unity of 
St. Petersburg rejected the idea of coming to an agreement in 
the first round of voting with other blocs concerning the 
consolidation of votes and the coordinated withdrawal of 
candidacies in favor of aspirants having the greatest chance of 
getting elected. Aleksandr Belyayev, leader of the bloc, 
reported this at a news conference yesterday. 
  However, according to his words, such a position does not 
mean that the DUP [Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg] will not 
cooperate with other blocs in the second round of the elections. 
The bloc is conducting negotiations on the possible mutual 
support of candidates who won the sympathy of the voters in the 
first round. 
  But yesterday the DUP finally published its preelection 
program. Its main thesis--St. Petersburg should become a safe 
city, which includes the guarantee of the personal safety of 
citizens, a fight against crime and corruption, a fight against 
ecological crimes, and the prevention of social conflicts. The 
social and economic policy of the municipal authorities should 
be subordinated to these tasks. 
  As for the fate of the head of the executive authority of 
the 
city, Aleksandr Belyayev did not agree with certain preelection 
associations that are proposing holding mayoral elections before 
the end of this year. In his opinion, conditions have not yet 
ripened for early elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Chernichenko, chairman of the Peasant </F>
Party of Russia: "Our Choice"] 
  [Text] To the chairmen of oblast, kray, and rayon 
organizations of the KPR [Peasant Party of Russia], and to 
members and friends of the Peasant Party of Russia. 
  The Peasant Party of Russia is faced with a major test. The 
first elections of the organs of local authority on a multiparty 
basis are drawing near. 
  Local elections are our elections. Find and nominate 
candidates for each seat in the oblast duma and in rayon-village 
organs of authority. Farmers, do not shun your nomination: 
Leaving authority to the communists will turn into your leaving 
your own land. Mobilize resources for the election 
campaign--your own, peasant, and the offerings of sympathizers. 
Agitation for a candidate should be simple, easy to understand, 
and take place everywhere. Our leaflet should be in the rural 
store, and our conversation--at the well, in the farmyard, and 
in the workshop. Do not go on the defense; the best defense is 
offense. Your candidates are worthy, respectable, and reliable 
people; your agitation is just; the farmer movement is 
liberation. Be able to explain to a kolkhoz woman on pension her 
benefits from owning a share of land, try to gain the support of 
all honorable workers, and do not be afraid to talk about the 
obvious vices of the Agrogulag--the universal theft, 
drunkenness, laziness, deceit, and corruption. The people know 
everything, be the yeast in the dough. 
  The party of free peasants will be opposed by the team of 
communists and agrarian bosses of the refurbished kolkhozes. 
There are a lot of industrious and knowledgeable people among 
them, but this does not change the fundamentals. We are for free 
labor on our own land, and they are for the preservation of the 
Agrogulag. 
  Rural life is such that the support of one head of 
administration is dearer than all the president's edicts. A 
village elder headman elected from the farmer movement can 
create the conditions of life and labor for hundreds of people. 
But a loss in the elections can echo with the ruin of strong 
farms. As it is, bankruptcy among farmers is extremely high. In 
1993, 87,100 individual farms were established, which is less 
than in 1992 by a factor of 1.5, while in 1993, 19,200 farms 
broke up, which is more than in 1992 by a factor of 3.8. 
  Local elections are a test of our political will and 
maturity. Do not spare any efforts--victory will come! 
  [Signed] Yuriy Chernichenko, chairman of the Peasant Party 
of 
Russia, KPR executive committee.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Stasov: "The Oblast Just Before the </F>
Elections"] 
  [Text] The preparation for elections in Leningrad Oblast is 
proceeding smoothly, in contrast to the preelection campaign in 
St. Petersburg. As was reported by Aleksandr Karpov, deputy 
governor of the oblast, the electoral commissions did not remove 
any of the aspirants and nominated candidates from the 
preelection race. All of them have been registered and are 
continuing the preelection campaign. 
  Despite the fact that the legislative assembly of the oblast 
will have very limited powers, a lot of people were found who 
want to become deputies. Today, 106 candidates are aspiring to 
25 deputy seats, and in a district of the Volosovskiy Rayon, 
eight aspirants are campaigning simultaneously for one seat. 
  Preparation for the elections to the municipality are also 
moving ahead at full speed. The candidates are also displaying 
activeness here: There are 1,031 aspirants for 430 seats in the 
preelection campaign. The sharpest rivalry of the candidates 
developed in Slantsy, where 40 persons are vying for seven 
seats. In addition, the voters in Shlisselburg will also have to 
elect a new city mayor, who will replace his predecessor, who 
was removed several months ago for various violations. In 
addition to the ballots with the names of the candidates, on the 
day of the forthcoming elections the residents of the oblast 
will receive sheets for voting in the referendum on the by-laws 
of Leningrad Oblast. 
  But the elections of representatives of a new type in the 
localities of the oblast--elders--have already started, and 671 
elders have been elected to date.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Baglikova: "Alarming Statistics"] </F>
  [Text] Heretofore unheard-of figures were cited yesterday 
at a meeting in Smolnyy: 32,400 children were born in St. 
Petersburg in 1993, while in the same period 85,600 persons 
died. For the first time in the history of the city, the 
mortality rate exceeded the birth rate by a factor of more than 
2.5. The family crisis situation is leading to the fact that the 
birth rate is dropping catastrophically not only in St. 
Petersburg, but in the whole country--89.9 percent of the 
families consist of two to four persons; moreover, a big part 
consists of two persons. There has been a significant increase 
in recent years in the number of single mothers older than 40 
years of age and younger than 18. 
  The attention of the rayon family and children departments 
was turned at the conference to the socially unprotected 
families--giving them material (and humanitarian) assistance and 
offering moral support. The obligations of the rayons also 
include making resources available for subsidizing school 
lunches. After approving the city budget, compensation will be 
paid, as before, for newborn children.... 
  How effective such assistance is can be evaluated according 
to the very same statistical data--only 98,000 children out of 
the 997,700 children of St. Petersburg are being reared in large 
families. It is probable that the birth rate is unlikely to 
increase this year either.

<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Dolgopyatova: "I Will Ask My Neighbor Who To </F>
Vote For"] 
  [Text] One week before the elections to the City 
Assembly, do the voters know at least something about the 
candidates and the coalitions they represent? Do Petersburg 
residents intend to vote at all? To get an answer to these 
questions I positioned myself, tape recorder in hand, during 
rush hour, when people are on their way home from work, in front 
of the building at 17 Bolshaya Monetnaya Street, which houses 
two Petrogradskiy Rayon district electoral commissions--No. 40 
and No. 41. Here are some typical answers. 
  Kapitolina Alekseyevna Kholopova, pensioner: 
  "I will vote. I am not yet familiar with the candidates, so 
I 
plan to stop at the electoral commission right now. You see, the 
candidate for whom we had collected signatures in our microrayon 
later removed himself from the race. I recently attended a 
meeting with another candidate, but I have forgotten his name. I 
will ask my neighbor." 
  A young woman who refused to give her name: 
  "I am not going anywhere. I am up to my ears in work and 
family; I have no time for elections." 
  Next passerby--two young men: 
  "No, we are not going anywhere; actually, we have no idea 
where to go and who to vote for. No one has enlightened us." 
  Valentina Petrovna, pensioner: 
  "I do not know the candidates. In my opinion, the 
preparations for the elections have been handled very poorly 
this time. I think that a serious mistake has been made on the 
part of the election organizers. City residents have practically 
no information. We now do not even see candidates for deputy on 
television, where one could at least somehow form an opinion and 
learn about the candidates' programs." 
  A young man, first-time voter: "We had the 
leaflets of some candidate plastered on the wall in our 
apartment building entrance, but I do not really know even his 
name. Since elections are being held, I have to vote, although I 
do not see any difference in principle whether a City Assembly 
gets elected or not. After all, we live without one now..." 
  Yelena Shevchenko answers, holding two toddlers by the 
hand: 
  "I am not going to vote because I do not trust or believe 
any 
candidate." 
  An elderly woman: "I have not heard anything on 
the radio--who we are supposed to vote for; we are waiting for 
information." 
  [Dolgopyatova] Do you not know that this time there will be 
no such detailed information on each candidate either on the 
radio or on television? Perhaps it would be better to stop by 
the district electoral commission and ask about the candidates' 
programs? 
  [Woman] And where is our electoral commission? 
  [Dolgopyatova] Right here, where we are standing now--at 17 
Bolshaya Monetnaya. 
  [Woman] I did not know. And how many candidates do we have? 
  There are 15 candidates registered at Electoral District No. 
40, and 16 in district No. 41. So Petrogradskiy Rayon residents 
will have to make a rather difficult choice--provided it takes 
place at all. 
  Igor Yuryevich Zabrodin, chairman of the No. 40 commission, 
also has doubts that the elections will be successful: 
  "Even if the voters turn out for the first round of 
elections, I have great doubts that they will show up for the 
second. Spring is on the way; everybody tries to get to their 
private plots on weekends," says Zabrodin. "Actually, we should 
take it in stride. In all countries only 40-50 percent of the 
population take an active civic stance. The others simply are 
not interested. It is another matter, however, that no other 
country has such "uncultured" elections. I mean the inability 
and lack of desire on the part of electoral blocs to unite. Many 
programs differ little from each other and practically proclaim 
truisms, which everybody knows by heart. But if you all advocate 
the same thing, why not field three or five candidates in the 
district instead of 15? I believe that in Petrogradskiy Rayon, 
instead of each three candidates, one could by agreement 
represent several coalitions." 
  ...Well, all we have to do is wait and see what the voters 
will say and what they will do; in any event, theirs is the last 
word.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Peshkov: "Will the Election Date Be </F>
Moved?"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg City Court continues the 
hearings directly related to the City Assembly elections set for 
20 March. 
  Yesterday hearings were held on the complaints of 
independent 
candidates for deputies, who had been refused registration by 
the district electoral commission on the grounds of invalidation 
of some of the signatures collected. 
  Dina Shulgina, chairman of a consumer rights protection 
society in Kalininskiy Rayon, collected the number of signatures 
required for registration--more than 2,000, but a small number 
of the signatures were collected outside the boundaries of the 
electoral district where she was going to run. The reason was 
that one of Petersburg newspapers printed some incorrect 
information on the addresses of buildings included in her 
district. The number of "outside" votes was not great, but the 
district commission refused to register D. Shulgina, and the 
city commission upheld the decision. The city court, in turn, 
dismissed D. Shulgina's complaint about the elections 
commissions' actions. Despite the fact that the elections are to 
be held in just a few days, the rejected candidate for deputy 
intends to continue her court battle for validation of her 
candidacy. D. Shulgina's appeal will be sent by mail to the 
Supreme Court of Russia. It is obvious that it will not be 
considered in time for the elections. 
  A similar complaint was filed by Vladimir Radushnov, 
president of Tais-Sport--a St. Petersburg joint-stock company. 
As the Dzerzhinskiy Rayon district commission established, some 
of those who signed for Vladimir Radushnov also signed for his 
competitor in the same district. All these "duplicate" 
signatures were invalidated. As a result, Vladimir Radushnov 
came up several hundred votes short of qualifying as a 
candidate. Nobody questioned the citizens as to whom in fact 
they support. As experience shows, questionable issues in 
matters of signature collection are not interpreted in favor of 
the candidates. 
  It is interesting that court hearings are taking place just 
a 
few days before the elections. The mayor's decision, which 
excluded some citizens from participating in the elections, was 
recently challenged by Federation Council Deputy Aleksandr 
Belyayev, who won the case. His complaint was found valid, and 
A. Sobchak's decision illegal. As we learned, A. Sobchak has 
appealed the city court ruling at the Supreme Court. Until the 
complaint is heard in Moscow, the city court decision is not in 
force. But the elections are to take place on 20 March. And some 
citizens will be deprived of an opportunity for full 
participation in them. On these grounds a group of unregistered 
deputies, as well as the Russian Peasant Party's branch, sent a 
letter to Russian Electoral Commission Chairman N. Ryabov asking 
him to interfere in the actions of the St. Petersburg city 
electoral commission and to postpone the elections. At this 
point, Moscow has not made its reaction known... 
  Today the city court will hear the Peasant Party's complaint 
on the city electoral commission's actions. There are five days 
left until the elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Gavrilova: "Sergey Tsiplyayev: The </F>
Choice Will Be Almost Random"] 
  [Text] The City Assembly will be adopting the City Charter 
and regional laws that will be mandatory. Therefore, the City 
Assembly will have a very important role in our life, Sergey 
Tsiplyayev emphasized in yesterday's conversation with 
journalists in St. Petersburg. 
  The president's representative is concerned about the 
outcome 
of the election campaign mainly because it was not properly 
covered in the mass media. There is no question, remarked 
Tsiplyayev, that if each of the more than 700 candidates were 
given 20 minutes of air time, we could only pity our voters. 
Television debates between blocs and coalitions, however, would 
have helped voters make a choice. 
  As it stands, said Sergey Tsiplyayev, name recognition is 
about the only factor that can affect the choice; if there is no 
recognized name on the candidate list, the choice will be almost 
random. This was exacerbated, on top of everything else, by 
shortcomings in the preliminary screening mechanism, which 
allowed 10-15 candidates per one seat to remain on the ballot. 
  Political capital is not earned overnight on the eve of 
elections; in order to avoid the current difficulties next time, 
a city political elite should form. A considerable role in this 
may belong to the mass media, noted Tsiplyayev.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Lvov under the rubric "The Press": </F>
"Foundation for Protection of Glasnost Protests Violations of 
Media Rights in Petersburg"] 
  [Text] Aleksey Simonov, chairman of the board of the 
Foundation for the Protection of Glasnost, sent a protest to 
Deputy Mayor Valeriy Malyshev regarding the violation of radio 
broadcasting companies' rights in Petersburg contained in the 
"Directives" sent by Malyshev to heads of rayon administrations 
and in the proposed contract between the STRC [State Television 
and Radio Company] Petersburg--Channel 5 and rayon 
administrations. 
  A broadcaster called "Administration" is not envisaged in 
any 
law, and granting this subject--mythical from the standpoint of 
the "Law on the Mass Media"--the right to enter a contract with 
a STRC is not only illegal but simply unnatural. There are rayon 
desks registered as mass media entities (dependent or 
independent of rayon administrations), and only they may be the 
subject of contracts involving broadcasting, says the protest. 
  In addition, Simonov draws Malyshev's attention to the fact 
the STRC Petersburg--Channel 5 itself does not have a license to 
conduct broadcasting over the wire, and therefore its claim to 
exclusivity in wire broadcasting is extremely questionable. 
  And finally, the unit that has been set up in the STRC for 
the purpose of monitoring the content of radio programs 
broadcast by rayons is an act of local censorship, which in 
principle is contrary to the current law. 
  As to election materials and their broadcasting through 
rayon 
"desks," the executive branch does not have the prerogative to 
sanction or ban this, even less so the "mother" television and 
radio company. 
  "The fund is ready to support a court action by any of the 
rayon desks, whose legitimate rights are infringed on either by 
the `Directives' or the `Contract,' of which we hereby inform 
you simultaneously with this letter," Aleksey Simonov continued.

representative of Russian Republican Party Maritime Kray 
organization and authorized representative of candidates to kray 
duma V.I. Cherepkov and T.G. Romanenko, under the "An Eyewitness 
Account" rubric: "Lebedinets and Tolstoshein Took the Mayoralty 
by Storm"] 
  [Text] A roundtable at the UTRO ROSSII editorial offices 
was interrupted by an agitated female voice: The mayoralty is 
under attack. But.... the mayoralty was not stormed for 
another.... 15-20 minutes. They began at 1814: An OMON [Special 
Purpose Militia Detachment] detachment poured out from a couple 
of dozen cars and, having easily pushed aside the women at the 
entrance, stomped to the 10th floor. The door to the mayor's 
office was broken down (this is the way they probably "seize" 
apartments?). Women were dragged out of the building by the arm. 
I personally saw V.A. Gilgenberg, for the third day the acting 
mayor (the mayor himself is ill) being thrown out of the 
building; in the process the metal door was thrown open by 
Gilgenberg's head squeezed under the arm of a powerfully built 
OMON soldier. The whole operation was directed personally by 
Lebedinets, who had announced the dismissal of the mayor on the 
grounds of criminal proceedings initiated against him and the 
appointment of a new mayor--Tolstoshein, and his deputy 
Terekhov. Attorney Ulitskiy was not permitted to visit Cherepkov. 
  At 0100 the pickets and journalists who gathered at the 
mayoralty became witnesses and participants in the concluding 
part of the operation: An OMON group, pushing their way through 
the crowd, carried out V.I. Cherepkov; his face was a strange 
green color and lifeless. The mayor was placed into an ambulance 
surrounded by militiamen, which then took him and his wife home. 
The small apartment quickly filled with people (it had not 
occurred to our mayor to get for himself a larger apartment 
while he was in power). The ambulance physician apologized--she 
was only carrying out orders. She recalled what a good doctor 
Gartman used to be. Now this participant in the operation 
approved the "transfer" of the patient that night. Which means 
that Gartman used to be a doctor; who he is now is not for us to 
judge. Among those watching the proceedings from the mayoralty's 
steps was a militia officer and some imposing figure in a 
"macho" black coat. I asked him to introduce himself but got no 
answer. I was told this actually was Tolstoshein. 
  At the same time, in a classic Bolshevik manner, they went 
after rayons where new heads of administration were installed. 
Head of Pervorechenskiy Rayon A.V. Kuchinskiy had his official 
car--some "land-cruiser" that before then had served 
Tolstoshein--confiscated while he was riding in it. The coup was 
now complete. 
  People we called in the State Duma assured us that this was 
all illegal. That opening a door with a man's head is illegal is 
obvious even without the Duma. That a sick man is "treated" by 
OMON is inhuman. That on the eve of elections all this is done 
to candidates is a mockery of the recently adopted Constitution. 
All together it is a slap in the face of the city, all of us. 
People may have different feelings about the mayor and his 
supporters, but when the law is trampled so brazenly, openly, it 
means that no one is safe--tomorrow they can use the head of any 
of us as a battering ram. Kray Procurator V.V. Vasilenko 
postponed a telephone conversation regarding candidates' rights 
until tomorrow, and denied his part in the operation--it is the 
investigator, he said. Someone among the "bearers" told 
Gilgenberg that the "kray court had concurred" on the action. 
  The militia--dozens of cars and about 100 participants--have 
demonstrated its might and drive. Would it not be nice if they 
used all this might against racketeers, apartment burglars, and 
pickpockets--Vladivostok would be safer than Lillehamer. 
  Office windows lit up one after another at the mayoralty's 
floors; S.P. Goryacheva probably will now have more material for 
new denunciations of the trashed mayoralty. There was no concern 
for observing due process--it is not necessary to comply with 
its norms during a coup. What to do, everybody will now decide 
for himself. But we do have to turn out for elections. And vote 
in such a way that would deprive the party of the nomenklatura 
coup from getting the votes--at least in our city.

<F P=106> [Article by T. Smirnova: "The Law in Camouflage Fatigues"] </F>
  [Text] A naive people, until recently we consoled 
ourselves: This is it; we have exhausted, through our 
grandmothers and grandfathers, mothers and fathers, a full 
measure of wars and revolutions, night searches and cattle 
boxcars. We played hide-and-seek with ourselves: A generation 
without wars, we will certainly sail into a quiet old age, will 
tend to our grandchildren and contemplate eternity. Alas, one 
cannot sidle into history! 
  The mayoralty was seized the second time. After correcting 
the minor flaps that had occurred during the first try. So you 
did not like the timing? You say: Why was the raid organized on 
a weekend; the people were not warned; and why did you stomp the 
floor, brandishing submachine guns? Our apologies--we all learn 
from our mistakes. Would Wednesday, in the middle of the week, 
be better for you? At 1800, after work? We can dispense with the 
submachine guns, too--are there any volunteers to go against the 
trained OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachments] guys and 
their truncheons? Regarding the warning--that you also had! As 
early as on Monday, authorized comrades had been trying to break 
through into the mayoralty with the order to replace the 
authorities. And by Wednesday the kray leadership paid a visit 
to the "Gray House," with the mission of dethroning Mayor V.I. 
Cherepkov and his first deputy, the city administrator V.A. 
Gilgenberg. The action was carried out by kray governor's 
deputies I.P. Lebedinets and A.V. Gartman, as well as kray 
administration department chiefs A.I. Yegorov, V.F. Terekhov, 
and K.B. Tolstoshein. A decree by acting head of kray 
administration I.P. Lebedinets was read out, relieving from his 
duties V.I. Cherepkov and appointing K.B. Tolstoshein as acting 
head of the city administration. In short, the protocol was 
observed--according to eyewitnesses inside the building. 
  As to eyewitnesses outside of it, they did not get to see 
much. OMON soldiers were behind the glass door, blocking it. The 
clank of that same door, letting out--in batches--mayoralty 
personnel. There were smiles on the faces of some ladies: 
Finally, real masters have arrived! Reinforcements arrived--an 
additional OMON group in camouflage fatigues. 
  "I managed to slip into the building several minutes before 
the raid: I had been warned on the impending action," says P.M. 
Dovganyuk, a former kray soviet deputy, and a candidate for the 
kray duma deputy. I was in V.I. Cherepkov's waiting room. Heard 
stomping feet and noise downstairs. Someone in the waiting room 
ran to close the door. I interfered--it did not make sense to 
close the door, it would be smashed into pieces anyway. They 
agreed with me. At that very moment OMON charged in. The storm 
troopers were being directed by a man in civilian clothes. He 
introduced himself as Ivanov.... City administrator Vladimir 
Gilgenberg behaved with great dignity...." 
  The closing scene of the city administrator's "dignified" 
appearance before the crowd milling in front of the building 
soon materialized. The door opened with a clank and Gilgenberg 
was thrown out, landing at the crowd's feet. 
  "As of today, in keeping with the directive, I was the 
acting 
mayor, because Viktor Ivanovich is sick," Vladimir Gilgenberg 
began his street interview to the surrounding journalists. "As 
usual, we were busy with work on that day. Adopted an additional 
decision on procedures for use of public transportation--free 
for city residents. Were putting the final touches on financing 
with respect to sanitation cleanup of the city. There were 
numerous financial documents, directives, important papers on my 
desk. And suddenly--the raid; my office is broken into, door 
kicked off hinges, and a rude "hassle" begins.... They dragged 
me out of the building head down.... Among the things left in my 
office were documents, my passport, personal effects, 400,000 
rubles issued to me for the election campaign as a candidate for 
kray duma deputy, plus an advance I had received...." 
  Dusk was enveloping the city. Temperatures dropped to 
freezing. Many of those gathered at the mayoralty steps were 
stomping their feet, made short jogs to keep themselves 
warm--the cold was getting to people through spring-season short 
coats and jackets. Many were hatless but were afraid to leave. 
Against the background of the darkened building, the tenth floor 
was brightly lit. In his office, Mayor V.I. Cherepkov was 
bedridden, hooked to an IV. His wife was keeping watch at his 
bedside. The full "illumination" in Gilgenberg's office was easy 
to explain: A search was still under way there. The eyes of the 
people on the street were glued to this strip of light at the 
top. Cars with special license plates were lurking here and 
there around the building. An ambulance with the "03" telephone 
number on the hood. Minivans with tinted windows--"Black 
Nellies," picket members suspected. 
  In those moments, many felt themselves lost, helpless, 
and.... unneeded. What do you do--shout in the middle of the 
night, in the center of the city getting ready to turn in for 
the night? Demand somebody or something? Deputy mayors, heads of 
rayon administrations were here; together with everyone else, 
shivering in the wind, these people stood outside their office 
building--now unemployed. They had been dismissed from jobs 
without any explanations, practically across the board--new 
bureaucrats, or to be precise, bureaucrats who had formerly held 
these jobs--already had been appointed. The circle had closed; 
the system had regenerated itself, rejecting a "foreign 
body...." Someone in the crowd kept repeating in amazement: "But 
why Tolstoshein? He had nearly the lowest rating during the 
mayoral elections--the people rejected him.... How can he, 
without blinking an eye, take the place of a person still 
there!" But nobody listened to these questions anymore--they 
were academic. 
  "What do you intend to do now?" the indefatigable ones kept 
pressing Gilgenberg. "How will events develop, anyway?" 
  "I remain a deputy to the kray duma. I will be meeting with 
my constituents. If necessary, right on the street. Let people 
see what can be done to the law here...." 
  Cherepkov was carried out from the building at past 0100. 
  "OMON soldiers were carrying the mayor feet first," said 
T.G. 
Romanenko, a candidate for kray duma deputy who kept vigil in 
the building until almost 0300. "There were so many people in 
camouflage uniforms that you could not see Cherepkov 
himself--only an occasional glimpse of sock-clad feet...." 
  This is how the incident in the mayoralty was carried out. 
Promptly and successfully. In the morning, numerous documents 
were read on the radio, explaining that since the mayor was 
suspected of committing a grave criminal offense (bribes), he 
had been temporarily--until the investigation was 
completed--removed from duty. The "temporary" nature of the act 
of deposing the mayor elected by the people was emphasized in 
the official comments many times. Each step in the seizure of 
the mayoralty was dressed in argumentation. Everything 
apparently exudes legitimacy and only legitimacy. 
  Nevertheless, it was all too thin. "Temporarily" put on the 
sidelines? Then why an equally rash destruction of the entire 
administrative structure created under Cherepkov? Such a hasty 
dismissal of personnel? Have they also been identified wholesale 
as criminals, or at least suspects? Cherepkov had not been able 
for months to get rid of obvious saboteurs--his deputies and 
rayon heads--because of all sorts of procedural red tape. Here, 
however, several minutes were enough--exactly as long as it 
takes to read out the personnel "sentence." 
  And also, there is this disturbing bravura march, the 
coronation speech on the occasion of the mew mayor assuming his 
duties. It was as if a magic tablecloth had been spread before 
the stunned city residents--transportation, dacha, merchandise, 
social and charitable goodies.... Which horn of abundance did it 
all come from? In what warehouses had it all been hidden from 
the city residents, exhausted by adversity? What billions and 
millions are behind it? If only this could all be true. Except 
that somehow one feels sad at this promised feast....

  [Text] Our correspondent asked Senior Counselor of Justice 
V.N. Chichayev, a senior assistant to the Maritime Kray 
procurator, for comments on everything that took place in the 
mayoralty: 
  "On 15 March a decision was made to initiate criminal 
proceedings against City of Vladivostok Mayor V.I. Cherepkov. 
And since he is a candidate for a deputy to the kray duma, in 
keeping with the Temporary Statute on the Elections to the 
Maritime Kray Duma, he cannot be the subject of criminal 
proceedings or subjected to administrative punitive measures 
imposed by the court, without a concurrence of the kray 
procurator. A measure to secure the appearance of the accused 
and other criminal process measures may be applied to a 
candidate only by the ruling of the kray court; therefore, the 
kray procurator did grant his consent. There is also a kray 
court ruling." 
  This is the process basis. The requirements of the law 
formally have been observed in this case. 
  "But was it necessary to do it all so crudely, with the help 
of the OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments]?" 
  "Having received the procuracy investigator's decision, the 
kray administration had all the grounds to carry it out. In what 
form to conduct this action is no longer the issue of a legal 
process, but a purely administrative one. If the law has been 
violated in the process of carrying out this decision, then the 
procuracy will look into it. Meanwhile, one side is standing 
there with posters, while the other guards the mayoralty; we do 
not have any problems with either. Problems will come up when 
unlawful actions are committed on one or the other side. So far 
we have not received such information. 
  "This is all I can say regarding the events around the 
mayoralty." 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  To the question whether it would be possible to review the 
kray procurator's decision--which, by the way, had been read 
over kray radio--Veniamin Chichayev replied that he does not 
have this document in his possession and does not even know its 
registration number. 
  Just as fruitless turned out the search for a copy of the 
decision by A.I. Vysotskiy, a deputy procurator and an 
investigator of the Frunzenskiy Rayon Procuracy. Like kray 
procurator V.V. Vasilenko, he also took sick and was not in the 
office. As to Aleksandr Ivanovich's colleagues, they said that 
they do not have any documents relevant to this case. 
  No documents in which we were interested were at the kray 
administration's press service. Neither were we able to meet 
with deputy head of the kray administration I.P. Lebedinets, who 
had signed the decree on I.V. Cherepkov's dismissal and directed 
the operation on the seizure of the "Gray House." We were told 
that he probably had gone on a trip to Ussuriysk. 
  An interesting kind of glasnost. For the chosen only. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  We telephoned the kray court chairman, N.S. Vinogradova, and 
asked her to comment on the events that had taken place on the 
night from 16 to 17 March in Vladivostok. 
  "No comment; all questions should be directed to the kray 
procuracy," said Nina Sergeyevna. And confirmed at the same time 
that the court is aware of the happenings and has given its 
permission for such measures, based on some local-level 
documents.... 
  Nina Sergeyevna refused to show the newspaper any official 
court document on the subject.

<F P=106> [Article by Andranik Migranyan: "Why Join, if It Is Better </F>
Not To Join?: Joining NATO's `Partnership for Peace' Program 
Will Intensify Russia's Isolation and Sharply Restrict Its 
Freedom of Maneuver in Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] According to the statements of a number of officials 
and the position of the Russian leadership laid out in the 
presidential message to the Federal Assembly, Russia does not 
simply "support the `Partnership for Peace' program as the path 
to common European partnership..." It will apparently officially 
join this program in the very near future. There is no unanimity 
of view among analysts on the question of whether or not Russia 
needs this program and what it can provide for it. A great deal 
has been discussed in official Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
circles and circles close to them about the possible advantages 
of membership in this program. I will discuss only those 
problems that, in my view, may have serious negative 
consequences on the strategic level as a result of Russia's 
joining this program. 
  First of all, it is no secret to anyone that the 
"Partnership 
for Peace" is an element of the strategy of the United States 
and the West with the aim of achieving a phased expansion of 
NATO. 
  The fact that they did not manage to expand NATO in the 
present stage by including a number of East European countries 
that yearn to get in, hoping to intensify their integration into 
the economic structure of the European Community through NATO 
membership, is viewed by certain of our analysts as a success of 
Russian diplomacy in the first round of the struggle against 
NATO expansion. 
  If we are to make a choice between the "Partnership for 
Peace" program and automatic NATO expansion, and movement of the 
entire military-political infrastructure of this organization to 
Russia's borders, then without a doubt the first alternative is 
preferable for Russia. Especially since this leaves the door 
formally open--with respect to both this program and NATO itself 
in the future--for all, including Russia. It is possible to view 
the situation differently, however. After all, the Cold War 
ended following the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and collapse 
of the Soviet Union, and it would be entirely reasonable to 
expect that in the absence of ideological and military-political 
confrontation in Europe, and with the beginning of a partnership 
(certain documents and statements even make mention of an 
"allied") relationship between Russia and the United States, 
between Russia and the West, the necessity would disappear of 
preserving a military bloc created as a deterrence to 
international communism. In addition to this, it should be noted 
that in agreeing to the unification of Germany, repudiating the 
"Brezhnev Doctrine," and withdrawing from Eastern Europe, the 
USSR obtained assurances from the United States and its Western 
allies that they would not take advantage of this in filling up 
the vacuum created and alter the military-strategic balance in 
Europe to their benefit. I think former USSR President Mikhail 
Gorbachev could discuss this more substantively and perhaps he 
will still do so. 
  It is entirely evident that there are no external reasons 
and 
no threat on the part of Russia either for preserving NATO or, 
even more so--in circumvention of agreements with the USSR, for 
expanding NATO directly or indirectly (through the program 
"Partnership for Peace") to Russia's borders. Most likely the 
United States and its allies are setting other objectives 
through NATO and the "Partnership for Peace" program, proceeding 
from their long-range interests. First of all, the Americans 
henceforth intend through NATO to maintain and consolidate their 
military-political leadership in Europe. Secondly, for a number 
of NATO member countries and for those East European countries 
that have become candidates for membership in this bloc, joining 
the "Partnership" program, the United States presence in NATO, 
and the alliance itself constitute a reliable way of keeping a 
unified Germany under effective control. Thirdly, the expansion 
of NATO--even initially through the "Partnership for 
Peace"--does in fact comprise real steps on the part of the NATO 
bloc to fill the "power vacuum" left by the USSR, with the aim 
of containing and disciplining what is now Russia. 
  A number of analysts believe that little depends upon Russia 
in the situation that has come about. Whether we like it or not, 
the process has already begun: More and more signatures are 
appearing under the "Partnership" program. Therefore, it only 
remains for us to find our place in this process. There are 
those who believe that Russia should push others aside and stand 
first in line at NATO's doorstep. It is strange that such 
judgments are coming from quite serious people--far from 
naive--who claim to be strategists in matters of foreign policy. 
  But in the situation that has developed, where indeed very 
little depends on us, we are already unable to stand first in 
line at NATO's doorstep. This doorstep is surrounded by the 
Romanians, Estonians, Slovaks, and Czechs. Ukrainians, Latvians, 
and Lithuanians are also straining to enter. It will be amusing 
to see how Russia--still a superpower in the military 
sense--will look in such a crowd, where everyone is screaming 
about the threat from Russia and therefore desiring to lean on 
the powerful shoulder of NATO in a search for guarantees of 
territorial sovereignty and security. Whether or not these fears 
and hopes are real or invented is a separate question, but 
Russia is still capable all the same of securing its territorial 
integrity and its own security. It is hardly worth it for us to 
knock on NATO's door and join the "Partnership" for the sake of 
obtaining dubious support from NATO against the territorial 
claims of Estonia against Russia. 
  If Russia were to immediately enter NATO as a full-fledged 
member and this organization were to become a universal 
structure guaranteeing security in Europe, only a madman would 
fail to support such a development of events. But under 
conditions where NATO sets the terms, where the bloc itself 
determines the schedule for entry of "Partnership for Peace" 
program members, hardly anyone can harbor illusions as to how 
long the period of Russia's "candidacy" for NATO membership will 
be and under what conditions entry will be arranged. 
  Those analysts are entirely correct who say that in not 
joining the "Partnership for Peace" program, and subsequently 
NATO, we are dooming ourselves to strategic isolation. But it is 
also true that having agreed to participate in the "Partnership 
for Peace" program, with preservation of the NATO bloc which 
decides who, when, and how one may become a full-fledged member, 
we find ourselves in isolation here as well. Russia can hardly 
be the same kind of candidate as Estonia and Poland, for 
example, and Russia hardly has the same obligations and 
responsibilities for peace and security before the world 
community as do those countries that have today swarmed all 
around NATO's door. In the face of myriad problems in both the 
near and far abroad, Russia cannot be on a short leash held by 
NATO when its national interests may require one decision or 
another to be made in some part of the world which does not 
coincide with the view of the NATO bloc, the United States, or 
its colleagues in the "Partnership for Peace." Thus Russia's 
entry into the "Partnership for Peace" program could give the 
illusion of the breaching of possible isolation, but will become 
a far more serious factor, facilitating the weakening of its 
position and leading to real, not imaginary, isolation. 
  The attitude of the country's leadership with respect to the 
issue of Russia's entry into the "Partnership for Peace" program 
is ambiguous. At his January summit meeting with the U.S. 
President, Boris Yeltsin noted that Russia does not view the 
establishment of European security through the "Partnership for 
Peace" program as a one and only opportunity, although it does 
not oppose it either. One would think the president's message to 
the Federal Assembly would contain great definitiveness on this 
key issue in the development of Russia's strategic course in the 
foreign policy sphere. However, internal foreign policy 
contradictions within the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs are unfortunately reflected in this document as well. On 
the one hand, the president's message mentions Russia's support 
for the "Partnership for Peace" program, although in the opinion 
of U.S. and NATO strategists the program should become a 
mechanism for gradually turning NATO into the single universal 
mechanism for guaranteeing security both inside and outside 
Europe. On the other hand, it is proposed to make the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) the main instrument of 
European construction in the military-political sphere. Added to 
this as one of the goals of Russia's foreign policy is the 
affording of cross guarantees to the countries of Central Europe 
on the part of Russia and its West European partners. Clearly, 
both ends do not meet here. Until quite recently Western 
strategists, advocating the automatic expansion of NATO by 
virtue of the East European countries, or at least achievement 
of the same objectives through the "Partnership for Peace" 
program, believed that adoption of the concept of cross 
guarantees for the countries of East Europe on the part of 
Russia and its West European partners would be a strategic 
victory for Russia. It must be said, however, that it is this 
very concept that supported the decisions according to which the 
USSR agreed to the unification of Germany and repudiated the 
"Brezhnev Doctrine." But while we have been talking about cross 
guarantees for the countries of Central Europe, the latter have 
already entered NATO's waiting room. The same is true of our aim 
to turn the NACC into the main instrument of support for peace 
and security in Europe. First of all, within the framework of 
the NACC too we are in fact joining as a single entity, without 
allies. Secondly, it is our former Warsaw Pact allies, now NACC 
members, that are longing to join NATO, and it does not depend 
on us as to how quickly and effectively the NACC can be turned 
into an instrument of European security. 
  Thus in joining the "Partnership for Peace" program, the 
Central European countries view themselves as candidates for 
NATO membership, and the question of cross guarantees loses its 
meaning for them to a significant degree. If Russia joins the 
"Partnership for Peace" program, we will in fact be giving the 
green light to turning NATO into the military-political 
instrument for construction of a new Europe. 
  In conclusion, I would like to sum up all the potential 
negative consequences for Russia should the "Partnership for 
Peace" program be implemented. 
  First. Historically, NATO emerged as a specific 
military-political bloc directed against the Soviet Union. The 
problem of its expansion lies in the danger that Russia will be 
strategically isolated. We must not ignore even the theoretical 
possibility of creation of a "cordon sanitaire" between Europe 
and Russia and the threat of excluding Russia from Europe. 
  Second. It would hardly be advisable to convert this 
regional 
organization, created to accomplish quite specific missions, to 
a universal instrument of security and conflict regulation 
throughout Eurasia. 
  Third. The proposed concept fails to stipulate any temporary 
framework for a transition period. A state such as Russia cannot 
be waiting in the entrance hall while extremely important 
decisions are made on matters key to its security. 
  Fourth. Whether the authors like it or not, this concept 
includes an objective attempt to block the process of 
military-political consolidation of the space of the former 
Soviet Union. 
  Fifth. Entry of the countries of Central Europe and former 
USSR republics into the "Partnership for Peace" program, with 
their subsequent passage into NATO, would push Russia out of the 
arms market with respect to these countries and thereby inflict 
a serious blow to our military-industrial complex. 
  Sixth. The inclusion of Russia within NATO (even in the 
long-range scenario) will in fact lead to conversion of our 
country into an outpost of this bloc organization along the 
border with the Islamic world and China. It is difficult to 
imagine American soldiers undertaking to defend this border the 
same way they once defended the border between the FRG and GDR. 
And so, Russia will find its hands tied, its room for maneuver 
restricted. 
  Skepticism that NATO can be an effective instrument for 
guaranteeing security and resolving conflicts is confirmed by 
the events in Bosnia. Clearly, Russia was hasty in agreeing to 
the change in NATO functions. Recent events have shown that in 
imprudently extending a mandate of broad authority to the UN 
secretary general so that he could entrust the conduct of 
peacemaking operations to the NATO Council, Russia, by the will 
of its gullible (the one defect Marx considered excusable) 
diplomats, denied itself the right of veto. So the NATO Council 
made decisions and presented ultimatums, without regard to the 
view and position of Russia. Without a full-fledged vote in the 
NATO Council, Russia will hardly be able to influence the 
decisions of this organization in the future on matters possibly 
far more important to it than Bosnia. It is a good thing that 
President Yeltsin exercised initiative at the last minute with 
respect to untangling the Bosnian crisis and rescued the Russian 
diplomats who had brought matters to the point where NATO was 
openly ignoring Russia's position and preparing to inflict 
strikes against the Serbs. Surely it would be advisable to 
perfect the mechanisms of the CSCE--specially created as a 
guarantor of peace and order throughout the European continent. 
But prior to that--the countries of East Europe should be given 
joint guarantees by Russia and the United States (or NATO).

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Ivanov, first deputy minister of foreign </F>
affairs of the Russian Federation: "What Russia Is Defending in 
the Near East"] 
  [Text] The present revitalization of Russia's diplomatic 
activity has been brought about primarily by the exacerbation of 
the situation in Bosnia and the Near East. But this does not 
mean that Russia was earlier a passive observer of the events 
occurring here. Our country was a participant in the Madrid Near 
East Peace Conference in 1991 and participated throughout the 
past two years, as cosponsor of this conference, in the 
negotiating process. Inasmuch as this process was quite smooth, 
diplomatic activity was not that noticeable to public opinion. 
  Russia's interests have traditionally been connected with 
the 
Near East. So our promotion of a peace settlement is far from 
fortuitous. The work initiated on the instructions of President 
Yeltsin is expressed both in contacts of the minister of foreign 
affairs of the Russian Federation with his colleagues from many 
states and in our active position in the UN Security Council. My 
trip to the region in the past week was made within the 
framework of these efforts. Its purpose was to meet directly 
with the leadership of the parties, to obtain information about 
the state of affairs first-hand, and to attempt to find 
compromise solutions that would make it possible to halt the 
violence and to resume the negotiating process. After all, as we 
all know, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon terminated the negotiations 
with Israel after the Hebron tragedy as a sign of solidarity 
with the PLO leadership. 
  A great deal of hard diplomatic work is now needed for 
finding a way out of the situation. There were meetings in the 
course of the trip with Yasir Arafat and the PLO Executive 
Committee in Tunis, with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, 
and with Minister of Foreign Affairs Shimon Peres in Jerusalem. 
  A practical step toward a resumption of the negotiating 
process could be, in our view, an effective UN Security Council 
resolution condemning the terrorist act in Hebron and opening 
the way to the creation of the conditions for assurance of 
security for the Palestinian population. Second, it is necessary 
to decide the question of an international presence from the 
viewpoint of both its format and mandate in order to guarantee 
the realization of the accords that are achieved. 
  It seems to us that an international presence should be 
realized with the active role of the cosponsors of the Madrid 
Peace Conference, that is, Russia and the United States, which 
does not, of course, rule out the participation of other states. 
For it was Russia and the United States that assumed 
responsibility for the peace process, appending their signatures 
to the Declaration of Principles of Provisional Palestinian 
Self-Government adopted last fall in Washington. The practical 
aspects of the international presence, on the other hand, would 
be resolved by the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships: Without 
their consent there can be no question of the dispatch of 
observers at all. 
  I was asked frequently during my Near East trip: Are Russia 
and the United States not competing over what credit will be 
attributed to whom? But I replied: We are not at the Olympic 
Games, they are over, the medals have been handed out. 
Russian-American cosponsorship presupposes both the joint 
efforts of the two countries and the independent diplomatic 
actions of each of them: This is what the United States is 
doing, this is what Russia is doing also. 
  The trip to the region helped in an explanation on the spot 
of our new initiative, which had originally been misinterpreted. 
We proposed, as we all know, stage two of the Near East Peace 
Conference. The reaction, on the part of the United States and 
Israel primarily, was cool: They were afraid that we wanted in 
this way to substitute for the negotiations that are already 
under way and, in fact, to cancel out all that has been 
achieved. But this is by no means part of our intentions. We are 
confident that the present Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are 
close to completion and that we need to be thinking today even 
about the future. Stage one has been negotiated, and certain 
experience--both negative and positive--has been accumulated. We 
now need to meet and think about how to further advance the 
peace process in all directions. 
  On 14 March Andrey Kozyrev will meet with Warren Christopher 
in Vladivostok, and a principal topic of the negotiations will 
be a Near East settlement. We will be discussing this topic with 
Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon also. We have traditionally had good 
relations with the Palestinian people and other Arab states. But 
we attach great significance to relations with Israel, 
proceeding from the fact that we could be an equal partner with 
all the parties, not an advocate for just one of them. 
  Attempts have been made in the Yugoslav conflict also, 
incidentally, to depict us as the defenders of the interests of 
just the Serbian side. But Russia has supported and continues to 
support equal contacts with the Serbs and with the Muslims and 
with the Croats. Shuttle diplomacy is in this respect helping us 
clear up the misunderstandings and find compromise solutions.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Viktor Posuvalyuk, special </F>
representative of the president of Russia in the Near East and 
chief of the North Africa and Near East Department of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, conducted by RIA correspondent Ivan 
Menshikov specially for SEGODNYA; in Tunis, date not given: 
"Moscow Is Active: And Gives Notice of Its Special Role in the 
Region"] 
  [Text] Russia's diplomatic assertiveness in the Near East 
reached its high point following the arrival yesterday in Tunis 
of Andrey Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of Russia, who 
was immediately received by Yasir Arafat, chairman of the PLO 
Executive Committee. 
  The details of the active shuttle diplomacy being conducted 
behind the scenes in Tunis are not being divulged as yet, but 
our correspondent managed to obtain a comprehensive interview, 
which sets forth Russia's general approaches to the situation in 
the region at this time, with Viktor Posuvalyuk, special 
representative of the president of Russia in the Near East and 
chief of the North Africa and Near East Department of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, who has already been here 
several days. 
  Responding to a question concerning the fundamental bases of 
the restoration of the peace process, the representative of the 
president of Russia emphasized that Russian policy proceeds from 
the need to preserve as the base of the negotiating process the 
"Gaza and Jericho first" agreement and the Declaration of 
Principles of Relations Between the PLO and Israel signed on 3 
September 1993 in Washington. "All the direct participants in 
the peace negotiations, Russia included, are confronted by a 
single task--making it recoilless," Viktor Posuvalyuk continued. 
He observed here that after 13 September "many people succumbed 
to a certain euphoria, believing that the process had become 
irreversible," but after the tragic events of 25 February at the 
mosque in the city of Hebron, "it transpired that we had all 
been `resting on our laurels' too soon." 
  "No compromise, as the phenomenon of a combination of two 
viewpoints, is ideal if seen merely from the standpoint of one 
party," V. Posuvalyuk observed. "But, by and large, the 
negotiations in Oslo and their `crown'--the Declaration of 
Principles--are of `an optimum diplomatic form.'" "Russian 
diplomacy not only knew of the secret meetings in Oslo but also 
actively assisted their successful completion. Despite the 
pressure being exerted from different sides, we always put the 
emphasis on the PLO and its present leadership as the sole 
credit-worthy partner of the government of Yitzhak Rabin, who 
came to power in Israel to slogans of peace." 
  Posuvalyuk rejected attempts to revise the said agreements 
inasmuch as it would play into the hands merely of extremist 
forces of all shades on both sides. "We must not farm out the 
development of events in the region to madmen, fanatics, and 
provocateurs," Viktor Posuvalyuk declared. While recognizing 
that fundamental questions of a settlement (the fate of the 
Israeli settlements on the West Bank of the River Jordan and in 
the Gaza Strip, the future form of the official status of the 
occupied territories, the affiliation of East Jerusalem, and so 
forth) remained outside of the framework of the said agreements, 
the Russian diplomat emphasized that, in his opinion, the boat 
could not be "overloaded" at the time they were being signed. 
  To conclude the interview Viktor Posuvalyuk observed that 
Russian diplomacy intended to continue to play an essential part 
both in the Near East and at other focal points of international 
tension and to step up its efforts in resolving conflict 
situations. "Russia occupies its ample niche in the Near East 
region, to which, by virtue of its distinctiveness, primarily 
historical and spiritual, no one else can lay claim," he 
emphasized. 
  Touching on the situation in connection with Iraq, the 
Russian diplomat observed that "Baghdad has already gone a 
considerable way toward compliance with UN Security Council 
Resolution 687." "This could at some stage, not too far off, 
what is more, put on a practical footing discussion of the 
question of the lifting of the international sanctions, the oil 
embargo in particular," he noted. Posuvalyuk emphasized in this 
connection that Russia "has a particular interest in this, 
considerable, what is more," alluding to Iraq's debt to Moscow. 
"This does not, it is true, release Iraq from its obligation to 
unequivocally comply with all the other resolutions," he 
concluded, "particularly those connected with unambiguous 
recognition of the sovereignty and borders of Kuwait." 
  The representative of the president of Russia announced that 
during his stay in Tunis he had "useful talks with Ambassador 
al-Ubaydi, special representative of the Libyan leadership, 
during which the present situation in the `Lockerbie case'" and 
also problems of bilateral Russian-Libyan relations with regard 
to Russia's serious economic interests in this country were 
discussed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, deputy minister of foreign </F>
affairs of Russia, by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA observer Denis 
Molchanov; place and date not given: "Was There a Breakthrough 
by Russian Diplomacy?"] 
  [Text] 
  [Molchanov] Vitaliy Ivanovich, whose idea was it to commit a 
Russian battalion to Bosnia? 
  [Churkin] I believe that this initiative was born somewhere 
between Yeltsin and Kozyrev on Saturday, 12 February. I was in 
Geneva and was about to leave for Moscow. I suddenly received a 
call from Sergey Lavrov (deputy minister of foreign affairs of 
Russia-- D.M.), and, citing the president, he conveyed 
instructions that I fly to Belgrade to discuss the situation 
that had taken shape following the ultimatum with the Serbian 
president. I flew to Belgrade that same day and was speaking 
with Milosevic in the evening. Then came Skopje, Zagreb, and 
Sarajevo and meetings with Izetbegovic and Silajdzic. Following 
the news conference in Zagreb, I was approached by our 
ambassador in Croatia, who said that I had to fly to Belgrade--I 
would be told why on arrival. 
  In Belgrade I was connected with Kozyrev by HF from the 
embassy bunker, and he directed me for the first time: work this 
option through with the Serbs--at Russia's request they put 
their arms under UN control, and we commit our contingent to 
Sarajevo. 
  I said immediately that this was a brilliant idea. I took it 
to Milosevic, he summoned Karadzic, and the three of us talked 
together. The main task was to invest this initiative with the 
most precise form possible. The Serbs had to be convinced that 
our battalion would be in Sarajevo in timely fashion, and our 
aims had to be explained precisely to the world community. 
  I spoke by telephone with Grachev, Ryurikov, Lavrov, and 
Kolesnikov. With Pavel Sergeyevich (Grachev--D.M.) the 
conversation took just two minutes: He assured me immediately 
that tomorrow he would give the order for preparation for action. 
  But I still had to receive the text of Yeltsin's actual 
message to Milosevic. Incidentally, up to the decisive moment I 
had not told the latter that this would be a letter signed by 
Boris Nikolayevich. This was my final trump card. And when, on 
Thursday morning, I went to the president of Serbia with a 
message signed by the president of Russia, Milosevic put a high 
value on this. 
  But this was not the end of the matter. It should be 
remembered that, granted all the authority of Milosevic and 
Karadzic, obtaining their "go-ahead" was only half the matter. 
The Bosnian Serbs are a law unto themselves, as they say, and 
would never do anything that was even to the least extent 
contrary to their interests (as was the case with the Vance-Owen 
plan, incidentally, when the Serbs said a firm "no"). So that 
even after the conversation with the president of Serbia, I was 
not wholly confident of success. This was why we went to Pale, 
where we met with the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs, and only 
then did I understand that the mission could be considered 
accomplished. 
  [Molchanov] Yes, this truly was a breakthrough. But should 
things have reached the phase where this breakthrough was 
necessary? 
  [Churkin] It would have been better had they not, of course. 
We had been conducting the process so as to ensure that a crisis 
over Sarajevo not arise. Back at the end of January we had 
proposed a two-tier plan for a settlement of the conflict: 
convening a session of the UN Security Council at foreign 
minister level with an invitation to the representatives of the 
belligerents in order to seek a political solution. The second 
proposal amounted to a reinforcement of the conditions of the 
security zone--we had in mind Sarajevo primarily, of course. But 
these proposals were not accepted. 
  On 6 February, following the explosion in Sarajevo's market 
square, I called Milosevic and said: "Mr. President, the 
question of lifting the blockade of Sarajevo must be settled 
now. The parties will be meeting this week in Geneva, and this 
simply must not be 'one further successful round of 
negotiations,' the issue must be settled." 
  Milosevic agreed. We went to Geneva. Late in the evening I 
turned on the television in the hotel room and heard Clinton's 
statement and, immediately after this, the news conference given 
by Woerner (NATO secretary general--D.M.)--the ultimatum. It was 
immediately clear that continuing the negotiations was futile 
because the participants were looking more at the skies than at 
their partners. 
  Incidentally--the NATO people prefer to forget about this 
now-- the decision on the transfer of heavy arms to UN control 
had been adopted by the Serbs and Muslims with the mediation of 
General Rose, commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, 
several hours before the announcement of the ultimatum. Thus 
NATO issued the ultimatum after the decision had already been 
made. And I, naturally, have the impression that the most 
important thing for NATO was not the lifting of the blockade of 
Sarajevo but striking a blow at the Serbs. Many people would 
like to change the political situation by means of such actions, 
but this would have very serious consequences. 
  [Molchanov] What is the explanation for the strange position 
of the UN secretary general, who farmed out the adoption of the 
decision on a bombing assault to the NATO command? 
  [Churkin] I would not want to criticize Butrus-Ghali but my 
personal opinion is that he was being subjected to colossal 
pressure on the part of a number of NATO countries, which very 
much wanted to bring matters to the point of an ultimatum. 
  Being subjected to pressure is the essence of the work of 
the 
secretary general, come to that. I would merely like the UN 
secretary general to cooperate more with the UN Security Council 
than the NATO Council. 
  We cannot agree with a situation where the right to 
interpret 
Security Council decisions is given over to another 
organization. And NATO, in interpreting these decisions, even 
attempted to dictate 
to the United Nations what should be done. 
  This is why those who maintain that Russia has seized the 
propaganda initiative and that everything would have been o.k. 
according to the NATO ultimatum in any case are wrong. No, our 
role was, in fact, pivotal. Take just the following fact: 
Despite the agreement between the Serbs and the Muslims, the 
intensive withdrawal of artillery only began following the 
commitment of the Russian soldiers. We asked the Serbs why. They 
replied: The public would not allow us! Women and children would 
gather and stand in the way of the equipment. But when we told 
them that a Russian battalion was coming, this was another 
matter.... 
  To be honest, when I was working on this problem, the main 
thing that I tried to prevent was Russia's national humiliation. 
Not a further escalation in Bosnia--although I did not want 
this, of course, and my instructions here were clear--but 
humiliation of Russia. For if on this occasion also everything 
was handled without us, if we allowed ourselves to be brushed 
off this time also, the consequences, despite our present 
dispirited self-awareness, could have been more onerous for us 
than the Bosnians. 
  [Molchanov] Truly, for the first time in the entire 
post-Soviet period we permitted ourselves our own say in the 
world. What brought about this change? 
  [Churkin] There was a transition from quantity to quality. 
Earlier the line had been as follows: If we do not like 
something or other, we shall not say "no" immediately, but shall 
attempt to find a common language with our partners. But in time 
our reluctance to get into a confrontation came to be perceived 
by some people as spinelessness. And we said: Enough! All the 
"i's" need to be dotted. As Yeltsin did in conversation with 
Major: "We will not permit it without Russia!..." 
  [Molchanov] I was recently talking with Vladimir Lukin, 
chairman of the State Duma's International Affairs Committee. He 
commented quite sharply on the American position in respect to 
Russia. "One quickly becomes accustomed to pleasant things," he 
said, "and America had very quickly become accustomed to us 
agreeing with Washington on just about everything." Today we 
have begun to speak with our own voice, and we have immediately 
been accused of neo-imperialism.... 
  [Churkin] Well, first, I would say that these charges are 
not 
the official position of the United States, they are not Clinton 
and not Christopher. These statements belong more to the 
opposition. After all, the present president of the United 
States has set serious store, the main store, perhaps, in his 
foreign policy by Russia. But there are symptoms of attempts 
being made to take us for simpletons (at some forum or another, 
say: What do you mean by opposing me, we are partners, accept my 
draft!). But we are increasingly seldom affording pretexts for 
people to talk to us in this way. 
  [Molchanov] That is, the transitional period is coming to an 
end? 
  [Churkin] Yes, unequivocally. We have drawn the line, I 
believe. And this line was drawn in Bosnia. 
  [Molchanov] We are restoring to ourselves great-power 
status, 
in other words? 
  [Churkin] Yes, we are moving along this path. Of course, 
this 
is impossible without a certain reinforcement--as in Sarajevo. 
Had we not had this battalion, what then? It is clear to 
everyone that there cannot be a great power without strong armed 
forces capable of accomplishing the mission entrusted to them at 
the modern level. And this work is under way. Our new military 
doctrine corresponds to these requirements in full. 
  [Molchanov] All this is well and good, but it seems to me 
that these goals are unattainable until the national 
self-awareness of the Russian people has been revived. But what 
is to happen when even such concepts as "patriotism" and "love 
for the motherland," have just about been given over to the 
opposition? 
  [Churkin] I believe that this was the democrats' biggest 
mistake when they began to use the word "patriot," albeit in 
quotation marks, in a disparaging sense. The word "patriot" is 
not enclosed in quotation marks, in the same way that the word 
"Motherland" is written with a capital letter. When people say 
"patriot," I consider that this is addressed to me, just as the 
democrats should have considered it addressed to them. 
  [Molchanov] The result is that the word "democrat" is now 
enclosed in quotation marks. 
  [Churkin] Yes, I believe that the losses on account of this 
have been very serious. We should have learned to equate the 
concepts "democracy" and "patriotism." Another, not mistake 
even, but tragedy, has been the fact that our democrats imagine 
the concept of "democracy" to be inseparable from the idea of 
the disintegration of the state. We are still dealing with the 
consequences of this delusion. 
  [Molchanov] Vitaliy Ivanovich, how, in your opinion, will 
events develop in the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Churkin] I have convinced myself repeatedly that to be an 
optimist in Yugoslav matters is to be a fool. One thing I can 
say: Our initiative prevented the intervention of the armed 
forces of NATO in the conflict, and this would have done no 
good. Aside from all else, in the event of our diplomatic 
failure, there would have been here, in Russia, a reassessment 
of our relations with the West, but no longer on the basis about 
which we have spoken--partnership with precise emphases--but 
closer to a position of strength. 
  As far as a forecast is concerned.... In any event, peace 
there is impossible without the consent of Russia, America, and 
Europe. Perhaps we will succeed in arriving at some arrangements 
in the coming weeks. But the main thing, I believe, is that the 
worst is behind us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukin, chairman of RF State Duma's </F>
International Affairs Committee, by Irina Denisova, under 
"Credo" rubric: "A Period of Heightened Nervousness Lies Ahead. 
`But It Isn't Mortal,' Assures RF State Duma's International 
Affairs Committee Chairman Vladimir Lukin"; time and place not 
given] 
  [Text] [Denisova] Vladimir Petrovich, you have been a 
journalist and an ambassador; you are a professor, doctor of 
historical science, and a well-known politician. What was most 
important for your professional career? And whom do you feel 
yourself to be? 
  [Lukin] It's hard to say. It all happened spontaneously. As 
they say, "Fate leads those who agree and drags those who 
disagree." In my case, it either led or dragged me, but I didn't 
resist. 
  As for whom I feel myself to be... Perhaps, first of all, "a 
citizen of the place where I live, but at the same time, a grain 
of sand of the Universe." One of my detractors said, aptly, 
"Vladimir Petrovich sees life as if he were looking out of the 
window of a speeding train." A desire to be inside life, "in a 
situation," and at the same time to look at it as it were from 
outside is, I think a good, useful quality. 
  [Denisova] In 1968, when you were working in Prague at the 
international magazine, PROBLEMS OF PEACE AND SOCIALISM, you 
spoke out against the introduction of soviet troops into 
Czechoslovakia, for which you were deported to the USSR. For 
more than 11 years you were under a travel ban. 
  [Lukin] There were several of us then who were 
"ceremoniously" dispatched to Moscow. In the same plane with us 
was Misha Polyakov, a nice guy, a specialist on America. There 
were also Kirill Khenkin and his wife Ira Kanevskaya--they are 
now working at Radio Liberty in Munich. There were others, as 
well. 
  [Denisova] The last two years you were the Russian 
ambassador 
in the United States. What were you able and not able to achieve 
during your ambassadorship? 
  [Lukin] An ambassador's is a bureaucratic job. Although I 
respect the ambassador's mission, I would say that in many ways 
it is a symbiosis of a postman and a waiter "with airs." A 
postman, because you get a communication from Moscow, with a 
list of whom to deliver it to, and what to say in the process. 
People in the host country are interested not in your personal 
opinion, which you are free to express unofficially: an 
ambassador is obligated to communicate the point of view of his 
country's official circles, the president or foreign minister. 
Well, and a waiter, because you continuously have to meet and 
treat high-ranking delegations. 
  [Denisova] And were you successful? 
  [Lukin] The first thing I managed was to master the 
ambassador's trade. I had specialized in international affairs 
and for a time worked on the central staff of the Foreign 
Ministry, but I had never been an ambassador. In Washington it 
took time for me to get to know the "thousand details" of the 
operation of a large embassy with a complex staff. 
  The second thing I managed was to create an image of an 
authentic representative of our country during the time I 
represented it. I was, after all, the first Russian ambassador 
since 1917. Besides, I represented it during a period of 
development of democratic structures in our country. I have at 
home a U.S. diplomat of the year award. The means the Americans 
felt my work was successful. 
  And third, I managed to establish good contacts with our 
compatriots. They saw me off literally with tears in their eyes. 
Yet until recently they would give a wide berth to our embassy. 
  During that time I got to know the work of the Foreign 
Ministry's central staff fairly well. Alas, it is in constant 
turmoil, with endless restructuring and reorganizations. Does 
this serve any useful purpose? In both the central and foreign 
staffs discipline and interest in diplomatic work have declined 
sharply. Personnel policy is in disarray, and some appointments 
are simply bewildering. In addition, there is a lack of 
coordination or sense of cohesion in the work of one of the 
country's most important ministries. And, incidentally, with 
one of the smallest, if not the smallest staffs: there are less 
than 3,000 diplomatic personnel. In other words, something which 
was always very important to me and without which it is 
difficult to achieve good results is lacking: a cohesive, 
smoothly functioning "team" at both the lower and upper levels 
of the ministry. 
  [Denisova] Your differences with Andrey Kozyrev are known, 
especially concerning views on the development of relations with 
the United States and the West as a whole. 
  [Lukin] What can I say... When I am asked if I have 
differences with Kozyrev I say, no, and none are possible. One's 
opinions may differ from those of a person who has opinions of 
his own. But what if he changes them every three months? What 
differences can there be in that case? Whoever is interested in 
this can compare what I said six months or a year ago with what 
I am saying now. And what Kozyrev has said during the same time. 
Everything will become clear. I have not changed my views and am 
not changing them now. 
  The situation developed in such a way that in his address to 
the Federal Assembly the president sharply criticized our 
diplomacy; he said what I have been saying over the last two or 
two and a half years. I am very pleased that our views coincide. 
Although I wouldn't like to look like the frog that says, "It 
was my idea! It was my idea!" I simply want our foreign policy 
to be independent, active, and show initiative. That it be given 
its due in the world and, most important, by our people. A good 
example, albeit an exception, that confirms the rule was our 
initiative in the Bosnian crisis. 
  I suggested something. That "something" was taken up by the 
president and, in words, by the foreign minister. It would be 
alright if it had ended in a handshake with Kozyrev, as is 
customary in civilized society. But then a series of intrigues 
began... That, however, is not so important, the case isn't 
mortal. 
  [Denisova] As I recall, it was not without your help that 
Kozyrev became foreign minister. 
  [Lukin] Yes, I recommended him to Yeltsin. Actually, I 
recommended two people. Kozyrev was the second, but the first 
had declined. 
  [Denisova] You just visited the United States with a Russian 
parliamentary delegation, you met with congressmen, diplomats, 
military people. Did you gain the impression that the latest 
events would substantially harm Russian-American relations for a 
considerable time? 
  [Lukin] The problem is that our diplomacy made some very 
serious mistakes, moreover, of a conceptual nature. Currently 
they are being overcome on the conceptual level. But the 
Americans have already grown used to our smiling, passive, 
doting, a priori agreement with them, and it is hard for them to 
readjust. That is why we are now doomed to a period (not very 
long, I think) of heightened nervousness and some controversy. I 
don't believe that there will be any marked deterioration of 
relations; there is no reason for that. But there will be a 
period of painful acceptance by the United States that Russia is 
a state which also has its national interests. 
  [Denisova] This is the second time you are heading a 
parliamentary foreign affairs committee. Is the committee 
capable, in the current situation, of influencing the 
formulation of the country's foreign policy and changing the 
situation in the Foreign Ministry? 
  [Lukin] The unhealthy situation in the Foreign Ministry has 
developed primarily because it is deteriorating as a highly 
professional collective; 500 active professional workers left it 
last year alone. The Foreign Ministry should work as a cohesive 
collective, not as a "group of comrades" consisting of 7-8 
people who make foreign policy while flying constantly from one 
airport to another. There should be concern for people in both 
the material and every other sense, but for that it is necessary 
to be "in the business" at least sometimes. Otherwise the 
diplomatic service will collapse completely. If the best forces 
leave, in future we will have no high-quality diplomacy. So far 
I don't know how to help solve this problem at the present 
stage, because under the current constitution the committee has 
no oversight functions with respect to the Foreign Ministry. 
However, we will, of course, do all we can for its personnel. 
  As for our influence in the formulation of foreign policy 
per 
se, it will be realized in strict accordance with the 
constitution. During the election campaign I criticized some of 
its provisions, but once it has been adopted it must be obeyed. 
  Under the Constitution the president determines and conducts 
foreign policy with the help of the Foreign Ministry. In this 
sense there should be no competition or attempts to invade their 
authority on the part of the Duma. At the same time, the Duma 
ratifies foreign treaties. Ratification is a powerful lever for 
influencing foreign policy. If its formulation is approached 
constructively, in the spirit of cooperation of the branches of 
power--which I would like very much--then we will be consulted 
before signing a treaty or agreement. Then we will be able to 
suggest what should or should not be done for the ratification 
of a document to proceed smoothly. 
  [Denisova] But so far they seem to get along without your 
advice? 
  [Lukin] Yes, if you have in mind the treaty with Georgia. 
They signed it first and only then realized that it would be 
very difficult to have it ratified. As a result, the president 
decided to temporarily postpone ratification. I hope they will 
eventually understand in the Foreign Ministry that it doesn't 
pay to bypass the parliament. 
  I would also like to note that the appointment and recalling 
of envoys is done by the president after consultations with the 
appropriate committees of the Federal Assembly. The consultation 
mechanism is currently being worked out and should soon be put 
into effect. For example, as soon as I returned to Moscow (that 
was before the president's decree to recall me from the United 
States) I gathered the committee to approve my being relieved of 
my duties. We then sent an appropriate document to the 
president's office, after which the decree was issued. We shall 
continue in future to work in accordance with regulations, and 
the Foreign Ministry and president's office will, perhaps, 
submit their comments and suggestions to us. I hope we establish 
mutual understanding and effective cooperation with them.

<F P=106> [Article by Daniil Proektor: "Legacy of the Cold War and </F>
Security Policy"] 
  [Text] "Renouncing cold war thinking means 
recognizing that `big wars' are contraindicated for the 20th 
century. The postindustrial society has acquired not only the 
potential for self-annihilation but also immunity to it. The 
latter is being recognized far more slowly than the first." 
  We have, evidently, to reconcile ourselves to the thought 
that political forecasts have rarely been successful in the 
present century. No one foresaw the catastrophes of three world 
wars and their consequences. It was not anticipated that the 
second would uninterruptedly grow into a third, a 40-year war, 
which was, hardly correctly, called cold: No fewer people 
perished in it than in the two preceding ones. 
  Despite the atomic bombs, which were declared a superlative 
guarantee of peace. 
  The end of the cold war has confused the ideas of security. 
Bloc opposition is clear and simple: Here's the enemy, this is 
where we are, and here is the "border of the two worlds," on 
either side of which are troop armadas, which do not advance 
against one another. And suddenly everything has changed. 
Security has disintegrated into a mosaic of permanently changing 
blurred conflicts and wars arising suddenly just about 
everywhere. Within states and outside. 
  In order to determine a rational security policy in a 
changed 
world it would not be inappropriate to link our thoughts with a 
recognition of the lessons of the cold war just ended. For the 
present grows out of the recent past, and, indeed, the "dead 
tugs at the living," however much we swear that this time 
everything will be in the new style. 
  The distortion of history over many decades has always taken 
its revenge on us, although this revenge has not always been 
recognized. It is distressing to think that in the present 
security policy also a repetition of the mistakes of the recent 
past is possible and that it is possible under the conditions of 
the present internal crises and upheavals arbitrarily or 
nonarbitrarily to slid into some version of relapses into the 
cold war--this barren historical failure. 
  The calamity of the cold war was the mythologization of the 
policy of security based on the ideology permeating it. The West 
and its institutions were held with us to be an absolute evil. 
Stalin's rejection of the Marshall Plan and reforms caused by a 
fear of limitation of his spheres of power and the penetration 
of "alien ideology" was the H hour at which the lag behind West 
Europe began. An emphatic start was made there on economic 
reforms, with us--just as emphatically--on a search for internal 
enemies and the struggle against "cosmopolitanism." 
  Ideology began to stifle economics, and with it, to 
undermine 
security. Together with the failure of the Berlin blockade this 
led to our isolation from the developed countries, which was 
made worse by another failure--the war that was unleashed in 
Korea. 
  These two losses of Stalin's in the cold war would hardly 
have been possible had our elite not believed its own myths of a 
decisive weakening of imperialism in the course of the "third 
stage of its general crisis" and had it renounced overreaching 
ambitions and the overestimation of the successes and victories 
of socialism. 
  When, subsequently, Khrushchev--a reformer and liberal at 
heart, but a hostage of the System--dragged the country 
simultaneously into most dangerous crises at different ends of 
the earth--the Caribbean, second Berlin, and Vietnamese--the 
reasons were, generally, the same. As were the results. 
  We may observe with disquiet how currently increasingly 
influential forces are once again attempting to insert 
ideologization and myths in the constructive policy of security 
of recent years. Responsible persons and leaders of parties are 
declaring the "harmfulness and danger of the orientation toward 
the West," which is hampering relations with the Arab world. As 
though the one excluded the other. The calls for once again 
counterposing "East" to "West" on the basis of some messianism 
are becoming ever louder and militant slogans from extremist 
circles similar to the rhetoric of the period 1910-1930's and 
the 1950's, which led to two world wars and an intensification 
of the cold war, are increasingly assured. An overestimation by 
some party leaders of the powers of their country and people and 
attempts to "embolden" them by prospects are noticeable once 
again. 
  I am sure that a principal postulate of our security policy 
should be a truth cast up by the cold war: Do not allow our 
country to become isolated from the civilized world. This means 
primarily treasuring the trust of others, who will in response 
value our trust also. 
  Stalin's policy in East Europe and Korea on the frontier of 
the 1940's-1950's and, later, the Berlin crises and the tanks in 
East Berlin, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia undermined trust in us, 
which we are sensing even today in the East European countries' 
insuperable attraction to the West. The chauvinism and 
xenophobia periodically artificially stoked in the years of the 
cold war are now spreading like burning lava over increasingly 
wide expanses, threatening the breakup of a great country and a 
further loss of general trust in it. 
  The lesson of the cold war is the need to overcome the 
mentality of the cold war. This is, perhaps, more difficult in 
some respects than tearing down the Berlin Wall: People's memory 
of the past is far stronger. Suspicion and remembered insults 
remain for a long time in the subconscious of all too many 
people. Converting this into policy is very easy when the world 
is indistinct and unstable. 
  The mentality of the cold war was stimulated with us by the 
demands of the system: to blindfold the consciousness of a poor 
society from a sight of the West, which was rapidly pulling 
ahead and becoming richer. But the movement of the world itself 
relentlessly broke down the mentality of the totalitarian 
system--the more fully this world of the era of the information 
revolution converged, the more widely it opened up to all. Our 
tragedy of the era of the cold war was the discrepancy between 
evaluations of the surrounding world and its actual character. 
The merit of the new policy, on the other hand, in the sphere of 
security included, is the aspiration to reveal to the country 
and the people the world such as it is. And to build relations 
with it on such a basis, not on the previous one, whose 
architecture was erected over seven decades. 
  Is the fate of Russian history of the past two centuries: 
the 
constant replacement of liberal reformers by those who either 
slow down the pace or cancel out both the reforms and 
liberalism, so inexorable? Are we condemned now to converge with 
the West, now, having taken fright at this proximity, to enter 
into confrontation with it? As in the cold war? 
  There are two hopes. The first is that we will succeed in 
making the reforms irreversible, having determined, finally, 
their true path. The second is that the surrounding world will, 
perhaps, pull everyone into the information-technotronic 
revolution to such an extent that the main crisis of the 20th 
century--between rapid scientific and technological development 
and the vestiges of the old social thinking in vast areas of the 
world--will be overcome. 
  Then genuinely collective security will ensue. For its roots 
lie not in this declaration and document or the other but in 
people's mentality and consciousness, in general trust. 
  But can trust be stable if we have not determined the 
priorities of our security policy and, in some respects, policy 
in general? All had been determined, seemingly: to have good 
relations with everyone wherever possible, with a particular 
orientation toward the West, as all of Russian tradition has 
indicated since the times of Peter the Great. 
  But suddenly, under the influence of some domestic 
conservative pressures, the command: "left face-about face," is 
being heard, just about. And it turns out that this orientation 
is not the West in general but entirely the other way about--the 
Asia-Pacific region. Or the Arab world. Or somewhere else. But a 
great power is not an infantry company, and grand national 
long-term strategy should not be called in question under the 
pressure of the opportunist ambitions of this party grouping or 
personality or the other. 
  Nor can there be uncertainty in respect to the Partnership 
for Peace slogan. 
  One has the feeling that under the shock impression of the 
results of the last elections a certain reconsideration of the 
estimates of external threats and of security policy in general 
is planned. It was acknowledged quite recently at the highest 
level that, broadly speaking, we have no enemies. The idea of 
general security "from Vancouver to Vladivostok" was recognized. 
There was talk of an alliance with NATO. We were at one with the 
majority at the United Nations and in the CSCE, we were thinking 
of joining the European Union, and we had established good 
relations with the United States. 
  And now, evidently, as a consequence of the events of 12 
December, we are hearing increasingly sharp criticism of this 
effective policy of security on the part of authoritative 
people. It transpires that the establishment of relations with 
the United States is an "infantile disorder" or the legacy of 
Brezhnevite diplomacy. For the first time since the times of the 
height of the cold war we have heard threats to start World War 
III uttered by us! Sharply worded demands for the naming of a 
"specific enemy" since the "military doctrine of the Soviet 
Union considered the probable enemy the developed capitalist 
countries, primarily the United States," and this was good and 
useful, are being heard. And so forth. 
  But if there is no enemy? Should we invent one in order to 
"educate" the soldiers more easily? 
  But we have been over this hundreds of times already and 
have 
acknowledged on thousands of occasions that the world has 
changed and that the dangers and threats are not those of the 
cold war but entirely different ones. And the concerns for our 
security have shifted toward the southern Russian borders and 
the sphere of national, ethnic conflicts. But why, then, 
resuscitate nostalgia for the vanished monsters of the cold war? 
After all, wars arise not on account of the existence of weapons 
but as a result of policy. You can have many missiles and live 
in peace, and you can have a minimum number and begin to throw 
them. 
  The difficult subject of attitudes toward NATO is connected 
with this also. It is understandable that 40 years of hostility 
cultivated their stereotypes, which it is difficult for many 
people to abandon immediately. If we are expecting a 
deterioration in our relations with the West under the impact of 
our internal processes, certain steps are then understandable. 
Fears that NATO could draw closer to our borders in connection 
with the likely membership of the alliance of the former Warsaw 
Pact countries and our Western neighbors included. 
  But if we intend to progress further along the path of the 
creation of a general system of security in the spirit of the 
ideas of the end of the 1980's-start of the 1990's, what is 
there to fear? It is hard to find serious arguments against the 
Partnership for Peace and the subsequent convergence of the 
security systems of East and West in some interacting structure, 
which could not happen any time soon, for that matter. 
  We do not need new Berlin walls at the borders. They would 
be 
disastrous for us. We need integration in the world. Inside and 
outside. And unified security systems could contribute to this. 
Inside, in the form of a common security space in the CIS, 
outside, in consistent movement toward what was long since 
called general European and, subsequently, a global system of 
security. Even if only in the next century. 
  A return, however, to bloc thinking would have deplorable 
consequences. After all, cold war blocs are a complex 
phenomenon. Defense against external attack is just one of their 
functions, not even, I would venture to say, the most important. 
The internal, "deterrent" functions are considerably more 
important. For the United States after the war this meant 
control and "reeducation" of German and Japanese extremism, the 
cementing of "Atlantic peace," and a strengthening of West 
Europe's relations with North America. For the elite of the 
USSR, control over the socialist camp and its unity and 
retention of East Europe in the orbit of the totalitarian 
structure and its protection against the impact of an alien 
system. 
  But the question of questions is the correlation between 
security and the internal condition of society. Involvement in 
the most dangerous crises of the cold war era was a consequence 
of internal factors to a greater extent, probably, than external 
factors. 
  In the West the fear of the ruling elites of appearing 
"weak" 
in the face of communism and losing the electorate and 
exaggerated fears in the face of the "world communist threat" 
stimulated the United States to war in Vietnam and an invasion 
of Cuba. 
  In the East fears of internal ferment in the Warsaw Pact 
countries, dissidence, and the undermining of the socialist camp 
prompted a series of crises--from Berlin to Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia and to fraternal assistance to 49 countries of 
the "anti-imperialist world" with the writing off of the debts 
of the majority of them at a time of the enormous crisis of its 
own economy. Here we have the roots of the present troubles. 
  What has been called the "logic of the cold war"--the 
incitement of hatred, furious distrust, and a mythical belief 
that the sole salvation lies in the stockpiling of weapons in 
the guise of a "balance of forces"--has taken shape as a result. 
  The main threat to the security of our people lies in the 
all-embracing crisis of society--the legacy of the policy of the 
cold war. If crime has become an internal war against the 
people, if corruption is demolishing morals and the system of 
government, if separatism is threatening to disarticulate a 
unified great country, if all this is the case, where are the 
keys to national security to be found? In a quarrel with the 
West and NATO, which are extending the hand of assistance and 
friendliness, or in the restoration of order within? 
  Our security is being totally undermined by internal 
processes, the sources of which lie not so much in this mistake 
or the other of the politicians of recent years (of which, as we 
know, there have been enough) as in the entire preceding era 
after 1945. And if we once again look for enemies across the 
ocean and in Europe or Asia and not under our own nose, we will 
be making even more grievous mistakes than those with which the 
cold war was filled. 
  This by no means signifies, God forbid, a call for us to 
forget about possible external threats. The bloody wars along a 
wide arc from Yugoslavia to the Caucasus and Central Asia, like 
also unforeseen changes in the overall situation, require 
reliable defenses--who can fail to understand this? 
  But it is a question of a sober evaluation of realities, the 
correlation of forces, and dangers and possibilities. 
  To abandon the thinking of the cold war means to recognize 
that "big wars" are contraindicated for the 20th century. The 
postindustrial society has acquired not only the potential of 
self-annihilation but also immunity to it. The latter is 
recognized far more slowly than the first. 
  "The atom bomb is a paper tiger," Mao said. Doctrines of 
"nuclear deterrence" are still in vogue at this time. But there 
have been more than 300 wars in the atomic era, and the bomb has 
not deterred them. After the Caribbean crisis, many people 
realized that no one would use it. But certain countries' race 
for "nuclear status" is once again in fashion today. The hopes 
of certain leaders that the bomb could be a splendid means of 
policy and an attribute of respect, and of certain military 
figures, that this would be an excellent instrument of war and 
victory, are incurable, evidently, like the most virulent 
pathogenic bacteria, like relics of the cold war. 
  And the final point. Concerning the dimensions of a policy 
of 
security within the framework of Russia's relations with its 
neighbors. The concepts of "spheres of influence" and "national 
interests beyond one's borders" are highly contradictory. They 
disturb no one if democracy and accord constitute their 
foundation. They are unacceptable if totalitarianism and 
imperialism are mixed in here. 
  The difficulty of this problem for Russia reflects the 
consequences of the disintegration of the Union. The 
impossibility of severing economic ties overnight. Millions of 
Russians who have been left abroad. The tremendous number of 
troops, a legacy of the cold war, who need to be removed, but 
whither we do not know. The need for Russia's peacekeeping in 
the conflict zones and for soldiers to guard what are now 
foreign borders. The strategic positions of the Black Sea 
region. And, finally, the specters, summoned from the darkness 
by conservative forces, of the consequences of the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which have not been forgotten in East 
Europe and which are once again pushing it as far away from 
Russia as possible. 
  It is clear that it will take great political skill in 
unentangling this knot of problems wound tight by the cold war 
not to overstep the fragile bounds separating that which is 
inevitable and necessary from imperial pretentiousness. The 
first would be understood. The second would to our and general 
shame be rejected. 
  In all this lies the problem of problems. The 20th century 
is 
an unbroken unprecedented general crisis, a global transitional 
era on the way to some new future world, possibly. Only in this 
context is it possible to think about security. 
  It cannot be ruled out that if the new generation of 
politicians simply disregards the lessons of the past cold war, 
it could pull the world into the semblance of a new one. Its 
possible outlines are not clear as yet. Whether there would be a 
series of some small cold wars or, God forbid, a new, albeit 
brief, NATO-Russia or Russia-rest of the developed world split. 
Both would be an intensification of our tragedy. 
  Yet there is hope: Good sense and a recognition of the 
experience of the catastrophic 20th century will halt the flight 
to nowhere. The world will inevitably come together and unite, 
which will help overcome cold wars and make security more stable.

  [Editorial report] Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 
for 10 March 1994 publishes on page 8 a 200-word article by 
Andrey Vaganov entitled "New Publications: Security From the 
Point of View of Academicians," describing the first issue of a 
new journal, GEOPOLITIKA I BEZOPASNOST [Geopolitics and 
Security]. The journal is published by the Geopolitics and 
Security Section of the Military History Division of the Russian 
Federation Academy of Natural Sciences, and printed by the 
Voyentekhizdat printing plant. Vaganov describes it as a 
"200-page, large format academic journal," printed on good paper 
with high-quality printing, with "something for the dilettante 
to read as well as something for the specialist to analyze." He 
quotes the journal's editors as describing it as an 
"experimental journal-almanac." Among the articles in the first 
issue are "Why Democracy Is Triumphing in Russia," by Cornell 
University Profesor Richard Darlington, "Forecast of the State 
and Tendencies for Change in the Geopolitical Map of the World 
in Regions of the Far Abroad," "Ethnographic Factors of Military 
Security," "Military Security and Defense," and "Military 
Aspects of Ecological Security," as well as several articles on 
military history. 
  Vaganov writes that the first issue contains no information 
as to the size of the new journal's print run or its 
periodicity. He speculates that in view of its high-quality 
printing and paper, it will attract no more than 1,000 buyers.

Nixon's Meeting With Zyuganov as Part of the New U.S. Policy"] 
  [Text] After Yeltsin's decision to broaden the social base 
of the reforms and to release the participants in the October 
rebellion, the West is beginning, it would seem, to "expand" the 
field of its political contacts in Russia. R. Nixon's recent 
meeting with leaders of the Russian opposition is a perfectly 
natural event, in my view. The sounding-out of post-Yeltsin 
Russia is beginning. 
  For the Western perception of the situation that has taken 
shape in Russia since the December elections there is no precise 
divide between those whom we at home have become accustomed to 
considering political antagonists. Yeltsin and Zyuganov, 
Chernomyrdin and Kozyrev, and, finally, Zhirinovskiy--they are 
all for the Western mind primarily "Russians," and only then 
"democrats," "communists," or "fascists." Such, if you will, is 
the Western aberration with our idee fixe of "national 
reconciliation"--such "reconciliation" emerged for the West, 
apparently, even before it did for ourselves. Is, in fact, the 
difference between Yeltsin and Zyuganov that great, for that 
matter, if the first is increasingly beginning to incline toward 
national-state ideas, wiring for sound what was just recently 
being proposed by the opposition? 
  The strong constitutional authority of the president has 
today neither an organizational nor conceptual pillar within the 
democratic camp. The government is beginning to play according 
to the rules of the opposition. This means that sooner or later 
the winner will be whoever produces political know-how, not the 
one who "consumes" it, stamping decisions in accordance with 
another's "license." 
  The main know-how today is the party. What in political 
science is called "organizational authority" affording an 
opportunity to initiate, introduce, and polish decisions adopted 
at government level. 
  Organizational authority is lacking, incidentally, not only 
with Yeltsin but also Zhirinovskiy. This brings them unusually 
close together, despite all their differences and 
noncomparability. The political style of both is "one-man 
theater" and the constant pedaling of the personality factor. 
But it is not the personality but the party-organizational 
factor that is becoming most important today. And the fact that 
all more or less important politicians have suddenly hurled 
themselves into the creation of their "own parties" is further 
confirmation of this. 
  Who disposes of real organizational authority in Russia 
today? Gennadiy Zyuganov's party. As of the present this is not 
only the largest but also the most structured party, having 
inherited from the CPSU a sizable personnel and financial base. 
It has a renewed national-communist ideology, one of the 
strongest factions in the Duma, and, according to certain 
information, good connections in the elite groups. In terms of 
type this is a power party, proposing the traditional 
techniques of a solution of the managerial crisis in the base 
sectors of the economy (and it is the crisis of management which 
is determining for the so-called "economic crisis"). In an 
alliance with the agrarian-industrial lobby and also in a 
potential alliance with the center and democratic-patriotic 
forces Zyuganov's party has a chance of becoming a serious 
political factor in the country, despite all the unpopularity of 
its ideology. 
  Is the West ready for a serious dialogue with Russia's 
communists? Strictly speaking, for Western conservatives the 
communist establishment has always been an object of close 
attention primarily as a traditional component of the Russian 
political elite. More, since the clamorous Fuehrer-type 
escapades of Zhirinovskiy, who shocked Europe with the imaginary 
threat of "Russian fascism," G. Zyuganov's balanced position 
might appear the most acceptable version of Russian revanchism. 
The West is looking in Russia for "righteousness" as some 
standard of what is to be expected from Russia in the immediate 
future. Neither Yeltsin nor Zhirinovskiy nor anyone else 
manifestly cut it as yet as "righteous." Only national 
communism, directly or indirectly influencing all the other 
currents in Russian politics, may be the "new righteous" today. 
  Russia has approached in earnest the phase of 
"postdemocratic 
stagnation," and one has the impression that the West has waived 
Russia's reforms goodbye. The main concern of Western 
politicians are not qualitative transformations within Russia 
but, rather, the geopolitical controllability of the new Russian 
revanchism. 
  Were not Brezhnev's stagnation of the mid-1970's and the 
suppression of the dissident movement not ultimately the result 
of a kind of "deal" between Russian and Western conservatives? 
It is worth remembering that the first phase of that 
"stagnation" pertained to the time of detente, and only after 
the USSR had invaded Afghanistan did the Western community 
return to the policy of the cold war. I see no grounds for 
believing that something similar might not be repeated today. 
The entire history of Russia's relations with the Western 
community indicates that its principal determining factor is 
Russia's geopolitical predictability, not the fate of Russian 
reforms and not the human rights situation. At the present time 
Russia is too weak for expansionist activity outside of the 
former USSR. 
  An era of conciliation, a time of geopolitical deals are 
beginning. I have always been struck by Americans' 
punctiliousness with regard to the formal procedures of 
democracy. During his January visit to Moscow Bill Clinton 
observed that the results of the December elections and the 
democratically elected parliament were no less important to him 
than the popularly elected President Yeltsin. 
  Strictly speaking, he could have said something similar in 
1933 in respect to the democratically elected Reichstag and the 
new German chancellor.

<F P=106> [Article by DELOVOY MIR correspondent Gennadiy Shilin: "Let </F>
Us Be Realists"] 
  [Text] It seemed that just recently Russian 
newspapers were full of articles and commentaries on the 
developing cooperation in the area of combating terrorism and 
the drug mafia between the FIS [Foreign Intelligence Service] 
and the CIA, and the intelligence services of other countries. 
It is well understood by everyone that this is a delicate issue 
and requires a special approach. But the most important point, 
which has been mentioned both here in Russia and over there in 
the West, is that this greatly needed interaction between the 
special services of different states requires a certain level of 
trust and, if you wish, sincerity, although it is hard to speak 
of the latter as applied to special service operations. 
Whatever--the interaction between Russian foreign intelligence 
and analogous structures in the West and the East over the past 
year has acquired real form. From searching for ways toward 
understanding we have progressed to exchanging information and 
developing promising problems that concern the entire world 
today. True, observers in the United States, Europe, and Russia 
could not help noticing that CIA Director James Woolsey has been 
increasingly often displaying greater activity in making public 
statements. And, what is especially remarkable, his statements 
have, as a rule, recently involved his agency's work in Russia, 
with whose foreign intelligence the CIA has begun to establish 
direct contacts and undertake interaction. 
<H5>  On the List of Priorities </H5>
  Actually, the enlightened reader will say, what is so 
strange 
about the chief of American intelligence supporting the 
continuation of work in a country that only recently was the 
main target of its intelligence penetration? 
  What attracts one's attention is the peremptory tone of 
these 
statements. 
  Speaking at hearings in the U.S. Congress special Senate 
Intelligence Committee, the CIA director said at the beginning 
of February this year (even before the arrest of high-ranking 
CIA official Aldrich Ames, suspected of working for the KGB and 
later for the FIS), that the United States has "four extensive 
areas" in Russia where American intelligence is active. 
  First, the CIA "supplies the politicians (of the United 
States) with important, and sometimes unique... analytical 
materials containing warning of potential dangers Russia is 
encountering." 
  Second, U.S. intelligence "continues to track the deployment 
and status of about 27,000 of Russian nuclear warheads." 
  The third "Russian" line of its work remains "monitoring the 
state of Russian Federation general-purpose armed forces." And, 
finally, the fourth is "analysis of Russia's policy with respect 
to its neighbors." 
  "The future of Russia, Ukraine, and other states of the 
former USSR, as well as potential problems that may arise there, 
are on the list of priority tasks of American intelligence 
activities," he said at the end of February, speaking at 
hearings at the Intelligence Committee of the U.S. House of 
Representatives. The changing political climate in Moscow, 
Russian policy with respect to the new independent states, and 
Russia's growing concern regarding the West's goals in East 
Europe and the CIS continue to be the subjects of the CIA's 
attention, Woolsey emphasized. 
<H5>  ...That Is What Intelligence Is About </H5>
  As we can see, the range of American intelligence interests 
is quite broad and its intent to conduct active operations with 
respect to Russia is beyond doubt, despite the developing 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  In this connection it would be proper to note that Moscow 
never hyped a situation in which an American intelligence 
officer was suddenly apprehended, or a Russian citizen actively 
working for American special services was caught red-handed. 
That is what intelligence is about, knowledgeable people 
say--learning other countries' secrets, analyzing them, and 
reporting observations to the government. 
  There are, however, some differences in the activities of 
the 
two special services: While Russian intelligence in the case of 
the Ameses, according to American sources, was interested in CIA 
operations in the Soviet Union (and later Russia), as Woolsey's 
statements demonstrate, American intelligence is interested in 
"high politics." The latter, as a sophisticated leader 
understands, is conducted in the Kremlin offices, and a limited 
number of people have access to it. 
  Is it worthwhile under such circumstances to raise such a 
clamor, as some American Congressmen and CIA top officials did, 
on the subject of detaining a CIA officer who shared secrets 
with foreign intelligence? If we approach this soberly, calmly, 
from the standpoint of developing partnership relations--hardly. 
<H5>  Double Bookkeeping </H5>
  Perhaps we should have put a period at this point, had it 
not 
been for one piece of news, which came practically 
simultaneously from faraway Australia, where local newspapers, 
as though on command, raised the subject of Russian intelligence 
activities. The topic--several Russian diplomats who had left 
the country back in the middle and second part of last year. In 
response to the inquiry of a liberal party representative in 
parliament, Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs Evans Gareth 
especially emphasized that the de facto expulsion had not been 
made public because Australia did not wish to aggravate 
relations with Russia. 
  Interestingly, the SYDNEY MORNING HERALD newspaper, quoting 
informed sources, reported that information on Russian 
intelligence officers working in Australia had been received by 
Australian special services at the end of 1992-beginning of 
1993... from the American CIA. (Note: During this period the CIA 
and the FIS were moving toward searching for areas of 
interaction!) Also, the CIA, together with British intelligence 
(which, by the way, also began talking about partnership 
relations with the FIS at the time), insisted that the 
activities of aforementioned persons were energetic and 
dangerous to Australian security and that insufficiently 
decisive actions with respect to Russian representatives on the 
part of Australian special services allegedly compromised these 
organizations. 
  Today, after the arrest in the United States of CIA officer 
Aldrich Ames, American-British pressure apparently was brought 
to bear all the way up. Gentlemen's agreements, which had 
previously been lauded in England and the United States, were 
forgotten this time. 
<H5>  Learn To Be Peaceful Rivals </H5>
  The campaign of unmasking Russian intelligence agents is 
gathering speed, and it is clear that its organizers have little 
concern for the development of interstate relations, which may 
to a certain extent be jeopardized, or the development of 
partnership ties, which are just beginning to produce the first 
results along lines important for many countries, including the 
United States. 
  Political salvos have already had a negative impact on the 
economic sphere of U.S.-Russian relations. The mass media have 
already reported numerous times on the blunt statements of some 
American Congressmen, who believe it necessary to immediately 
suspend appropriations of any money whatsoever to support the 
program of reforms in Russia. Now we are getting the first 
reactions from experts and direct capital holders. It should be 
noted that they reflect a much more realistic approach to the 
problem. 
  "The effect of the Ames affair should be short-lived," the 
REUTER agency quotes Aleksis Rodzyanko, managing director of the 
Chemical Bank--the largest in the United States. Neither do 
representatives of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Johnson &amp; 
Johnson foresee any problems for their companies. But this, it 
should be noted in parentheses, mainly goes for companies 
already actively doing business in Russia, who have invested 
serious capital in the country and have established themselves 
in the market. 
  The spy scandal per se will undoubtedly die down; however, 
the reverberations of the noise raised around it will long serve 
as an irritant, causing excessive caution among 
investors--especially those who are just contemplating investing 
their capital in Russia. Thus, they are in a way being pushed in 
the direction of thinking that with all the attractiveness of 
the Russian market, there exist numerous others--East European, 
Asian, or Latin American--where investment can bring no less 
profit to American companies, and without fear of being "accused 
of collaborationism." 
  At this point, as a counterbalance, I want to quote the 
remarks of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at 
hearings on the federal budget for the 1995 fiscal year at the 
subcommittee for operations abroad of the U.S. House of 
Representatives Appropriations Committee. The United States 
"must be a realist" in conducting policy with respect to Russia, 
he said, expressing the administration's opinion. 
  As American-Russian relations develop, disagreements are 
inevitable, believes W. Christopher, and in this case the United 
States must act on the basis of its national interests. 
Recalling some Congressmen's calls for cutting or suspending aid 
to Russia entirely in connection with the Ames case, he said: 
"It is not in our interests to be mere spectators watching the 
course of reforms in Russia." The secretary of state reminded 
legislators of the words of President Clinton, who considers aid 
to Russian reform not charity but an investment in American 
security and prosperity. "Our dollars... will turn into credit 
guarantees for American exporters and investors," he emphasized. 
To change the current course toward Russia would mean to damage 
American interests first and foremost. 
  Realists understand perfectly well that in politics one 
should not mix two unrelated things. The cold war is a thing of 
the past, and it is not in our common interests to resurrect it. 
As the Paris newspaper L'ECHO writes, the "Ames case" will be 
good for both Russia and the United States if it helps them 
understand that the end of ideological confrontation between the 
two grandees does not mean the end of rivalry between them, 
which is natural for such major powers, and that now they have 
to learn to compete peacefully.

Diplomacy Steps Up Its Activity on Russia's Southern Borders: 
The Consequences of This Could Be Ambiguous, Including for the 
United States Itself"] 
  [Text] 
  In a short space of time a third CIS leader has gone to the 
United States: Clinton has received Kravchuk, he has received 
Nazarbayev, and now, Shevardnadze. All three countries have 
experienced quite strong pressure on the part of Moscow and 
could ultimately have been seeking an outside distraction, in 
any event, checking the extent to which the world is prepared to 
accept CIS countries outside of a Russian context. 
  Of the three countries, Georgia is the most susceptible to 
Russian influence--acknowledging Moscow's direct impact on the 
course of the Abkhaz conflict and the possibility of freezing 
it, its official representatives have thus far been expressing 
regret at the fact that international organizations have been in 
no hurry to respond to the joint requests of Moscow and Tbilisi 
concerning formalization of Russian peacekeeping in the zone of 
the conflict. The fact that Shevardnadze discussed in Washington 
the possibility of the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping contingent 
to Abkhazia and obtained support has for himself one attractive 
circumstance--Georgia's prospects are still linked with him 
personally, and, supporting him, Western leaders are supporting 
the present regime and have an interest in its stabilization. 
All other prospects are more doubtful. 
  Doubt number one--how long will it be necessary to 
wait for the prospects of a "firm political settlement," that 
is, for the parties to have reached a compromise which makes it 
possible to begin a peacekeeping operation without subjecting 
the soldiers to the unpredictable vicissitudes of the war. The 
appearance of "blue helmets" in a region stuffed with Russian 
arms in direct proximity to the troubled Russian borders is in 
itself a political problem. Russia is jealous not so much of the 
fact of the presence of UN soldiers as of the "outside" 
political influence on Georgia. The Abkhaz leadership could 
attempt to derive practical benefits for itself from the latent 
rivalry. Although it has no one from whom it can expect 
political recognition, enshrining the present status quo with 
the aid of its Moscow allies is possible. 
  But Georgia, split not only along the line of the front but 
also divided into spheres of influence, would be even further 
from stability than now. Russia, even having signed the 
notorious cooperation treaty with it, played on its weakness. 
But Georgia will remain a weak country--with a financial system 
in a state of collapse and blocked lines of communication and 
cut off from energy supplies--until the internal problems are 
resolved and it becomes a self-sufficient state. Russia, despite 
all its ambitions, lacks the resources to "pay" for the 
corresponding political orientation--its "residual" influence 
has been sufficient thus far only for maintaining Georgia in a 
disorganized state. And Western investments would be spent on 
the war, as if on a glutton. Inasmuch as the main candidates for 
the role of peacemakers in the region--Russia and international 
organizations--have as of late been pushing disagreements more 
than seeking mutual understanding, the problems in their 
relations will be resolved at the expense of Georgia and 
Abkhazia. They can only be alleviated by a Georgian-Abkhaz 
compromise, but it, judging by the failure of the recent Geneva 
negotiations, is unattainable as yet.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Ignatenko under the heading: "American </F>
Diplomacy Steps Up Its Activity on Russia's Southern Borders: 
The Consequences of This Could Be Ambiguous, Including for the 
United States Itself"] 
  [Text] 
  The United States is increasing its penetration of the 
region 
of the post-Soviet South--the Caucasus and Central Asia. The 
local states here are being drawn into the NATO Partnership for 
Peace program. The news media are carrying reports each more 
sensational than the last: The Americans are studying the 
question of safeguarding Kazakhstan's Caspian Sea coast with the 
American Coastguard; NATO emissaries are proposing the formation 
in Kyrgyzstan of a mountain division; the American State 
Department (sic) is working out a plan for the commitment of UN 
"blue helmets" to the zone of the Georgia-Abkhaz conflict with 
the obligatory withdrawal of Russian troops beyond the River 
Psou, that is, beyond the Georgian-Russian border; the United 
States is offering to assist Georgia in the creation of a 
Georgian regular army. 
  These and other facts compel the assumption that the United 
States (directly in places, under the "roof" of NATO and the 
United Nations in others) has made an emphatic turn toward the 
post-Soviet South, methodically supplanting the Russians in this 
region. Not all the enumerated facts and assessments lend 
themselves to swift verification, and it could be that I am 
mistaken in some respects, but I do not want to be overtaken by 
events and would like, before it is too late, to address to 
those who make the decisions in Washington (may they believe 
me!) some well-meant thoughts. 
  Were I an American "hawk," I also, most likely, would be 
drawn toward the post-Soviet South. Why? 
  The United States could peacefully or with the minimum use 
of 
military force score an unprecedented strategic win. Having 
penetrated the region of the post-Soviet South, it would have 
moved into the rear of a whole number of states against which 
the United States has or could have complaints of various kinds 
(Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, China, Pakistan, India, and, of 
course, Russia). 
  Test ranges of the former Ministry of Defense of the USSR 
(nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological and missile and space 
research centers on the territory of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan) 
are located in the region. It cannot be ruled out that there are 
some in the United States who are interpreting the slogan of the 
Nevada-Semipalatinsk antinuclear movement as an itinerary for 
the transfer of test ranges. But exclusion of the possibility of 
use of the Baykonur complex by the Russian military and space 
forces (and, possibly, its use by NATO and the United States) 
would be of the greatest importance to the United States in a 
military-strategic respect. 
  The United States could also control the raw material 
resources of the post-Soviet South. The detachment of Russia 
from the strategically important types of raw material of 
Central Asia which Russia either lacks, virtually, or of which 
it has insufficient quantities--uranium, copper-porphyritic, 
pyrite, and stratiform ores, manganese, chromites, strontium 
ores, germanium, and so forth--is possible. Naturally, use of 
these stocks by the United States itself and/or its allies 
cannot be ruled out either. 
  And what is most important, perhaps: OIL. This requires a 
separate paragraph. The priority interests of the United States 
include control of the Caspian hydrocarbon mega-field, just 
about the most important in the world, whose oil and gas beds 
can be developed not only in Iran but also in the post-Soviet 
South--Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan. 
  The United States also needs to ensure its control of the 
shipment of raw material and other resources both in the Central 
Asia-Caucasus-Europe direction and in the Central Asia-Indian 
Ocean direction. 
  And, finally, stability. The United States needs 
this to realize the listed and other of its interests. 
Naturally, the stability must correspond to American criteria. 
To this end the United States must do its utmost to establish in 
the region of the post-Soviet South pro-America regimes of a 
liberal-democratic persuasion. 
  It is possible that I have not mentioned everything. But 
even 
the considerations that have been noted are sufficient for 
recognizing the charted aims as being to the advantage of the 
United States. 
  I would like to call Americans' attention to the problems 
that would threaten the United States in the event of their 
forced penetration of the post-Soviet South. The threats and 
dangers would grow in the proportion to the number and scale of 
America's successes, what is more. 
  First, what is most obvious. Russia could not fail 
to respond to attempts to make it a passive observer of the 
processes, extremely dangerous for its very future, that are 
already under way on its southern borders. The specter of a new 
"cold war" already looms in Russian-American relations. It is 
obvious also that a development of events in the contemplated 
direction would signify a growth of the anti-American mood in 
Russia, the corresponding evolution of the regime (if not its 
replacement), and an even greater exacerbation of 
Russian-American relations. 
  Second, the intrusion of a foreign element into 
the region and an aspiration to isolate and weaken Russia and 
the other regional powers with traditional interests here--all 
this could disrupt the stable geopolitical balance, which would 
inevitably lead to the unpredictable and dangerous fragmentation 
of the geopolitical space. In a search for military-political 
allies, Russia could turn to Iran, Iraq.... 
  Third, in the Americans' place I would think long 
and hard before undertaking a concentrated military-political 
penetration of the region of the post-Soviet South. The region 
is characterized by an extremely high degree of conflict 
potential. A listing of the conflicts that have flared up and 
those that are ready to erupt (even more numerous and serious) 
could have taken up the whole of this article. The introduction 
into this zone of a foreign element and internationalization of 
the conflicts with regard to the United States would necessarily 
signify a growth of the conflict potential. And, naturally, 
destabilization--regional and, possibly, global. 
  Fourth, were I an American, I would beware of an 
outbreak of Islamic fundamentalism--not that which is attributed 
to Iran but that which would flourish independently, without 
outside influence even, as a luxuriant bloom in all Muslim 
states of the post-Soviet South to which the United States came. 
Imagine, in addition, a combination of different streams of 
Islamic fundamentalism here--Near East and Middle East, Central 
Asian and Caucasian.... Imagine also a combination of Islamic 
fundamentalism and Russian nationalism (there have been such 
theoretical and practical attempts).... 
  Fifth, no one has yet calculated what the 
corresponding expenditure would cost the American taxpayer. And 
how many American soldiers would, God forbid, lay down their 
lives in the mountains of the Caucasus and the deserts of 
Central Asia. 
  American penetration of the post-Soviet South would be 
dangerous primarily for the United States itself, not to mention 
the likelihood of regional and global destabilization. I see the 
Americans in this region in the role of torch-bearers who have 
blundered into the powder magazine. God bless America!

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kalashnikova: "They Waited Until the </F>
Russian Bear Awoke"] 
  [Text] "Since you are so smart, where is your money?" 
Kurt Vonnegut, "Slaughterhouse Five, or The Children's 
Crusade" 
  A cool front has blown in from the West. That is, it is not 
so much that there has been a bone-chilling draft, but the cold 
spell has dragged on for quite some time. Calls for a freezing 
of aid to Russia--for 60 days--such being, evidently, the 
initial auction price of the damage done to America's security 
by the Ames spies--have been heard in the U.S. Congress from 
Republicans and Democrats alike. The White House is giving 
assurances as yet that it will resist in every possible way a 
winding down of assistance to Russia. But judging by the fact 
that the row in connection with this business is becoming louder 
by the hour--despite Moscow's more than limp response, 
Washington is working the bellows with enviable persistence--the 
bargaining will continue. 
  Not only the Americans, but other Western "auction 
attendees" 
would like to take part in it, most likely, also. And accord 
here is the sure way to success. Bill Clinton was recently paid 
a call by John Major, who attempted with might and main to 
reassure the president. He even spent a night at the White House 
(which, prior to him, had not been the case with any foreign 
visitor). The prime minister and the president agreed that the 
intelligence services of Britain and the United States would 
cooperate (as has not been the case since the times of World War 
II) to nullify the damage from the "Ames case." What its final 
price will be, Russia will soon find out--Moscow will resume 
negotiations with the West after the government reshuffle, which 
has finally been completed. New consultations with the European 
Union on a partnership agreement, casuistical procedures for 
Russia's affiliation to the GATT, and the completion of 
negotiations with the IMF and creditors are in the offing. Some 
visible outlines of the relations with the potential "auction 
attendees" will be manifested tomorrow, even--on the completion 
of the meeting of the finance ministers of the Seven. They will 
now be dealing with a somewhat different Russia, for that 
matter. The term "great power," which had been farmed out to 
historians, is being enshrined officially in the Russian 
political vocabulary, evidently--to judge by Boris Yeltsin's 
report to parliament, at least. And the West's delay in 
expressing some in any way definite response to it may be seen 
as a timeout for reflection. But some UN wits have already let 
fall: "The Russian bear has awoken." Not original, of course, 
but it is, in fact, impossible to sleep permanently. 
  Just some six months ago, relations between Russia and the 
West seemed all but idyllic. And pure, as in any idyll, that is, 
clouded by virtually no mercantilism. The partners were true to 
one another: They promised us assistance, we, them, a constant 
intensification of the reforms. And what promises these were! 
Moscow literally became muddled over these billions--now $24 
billion, now $43.4 billion. The West, on the other hand, was 
exultant at the prospects of so-called "shock therapy," which, 
as has now transpired, has simply not occurred. 
  And all would have gone splendidly had it not been for 
Russia's Higher Destiny--the October crisis had once again shown 
the world "how not to live." According to the observations of 
certain Russian participants in the negotiations, embarrassment 
flickered in the eyes of their Western colleagues even then: How 
can this happen--firing from tanks at the parliament building. 
But the tension--at the level of the former promises, at 
least--was lifted: Moscow even managed to "squeeze through" 
preliminary arrangements with the European Union, which were 
greatly to its advantage. The situation was complicated somewhat 
by the subsequent mass foray of Russia's ministers among the 
ranks of members of parliament, which fairly set them at odds. 
This dirty Russian linen was quite often washed before Western 
eyes, which did little to strengthen the positions of Moscow 
officialdom there. And as a result of the enervating process of 
formation of the new cabinet, which culminated in the departure 
from it of persons sympathetic to the West, a pregnant pause 
arose in the East-West dialogue. Russia's neighbors hastened to 
fill it--in the wake of the former Warsaw Pact allies, the 
Baltic countries and fraternal Ukraine got in line for NATO 
admittance, and no less fraternal Kazakhstan expressed a 
preference for the United States when it came to use of the 
Baykonur Cosmodrome--symbol of the sovereign pride of the USSR. 
  The change in the Western participants' attitude toward the 
negotiations with Russia could until recently have been judged 
only by individual nuances. The London Club of creditor-banks, 
which had consented at the end of last year to all of Moscow's 
conditions, for example, recently notified its Russian 
colleagues that it would insist on its former 
demands--renunciation of "sovereign immunity," which is 
disadvantageous to Russia. In the event of its violating the 
payments' format, this threatened pretrial investigations and 
the attachment of all assets of Russia and the Central Bank. The 
Paris Club, on the other hand, has confined itself thus far 
merely to a hint of a possible tightening of the rules of the 
game. Reefs show through in its offer to extend the agreement 
with Russia for 1993 a further four months: Moscow would have to 
pay for the restructuring of the debt not 40 percent, as 
earlier, but all 100 percent. The negotiations with the European 
Union are clearly being dragged out also--to flashing smiles and 
toasts to partnership. Although in the course of the November 
Russian-European summit Boris Yeltsin and Jacques Delors 
affirmed that all obstacles to the signing of a broad-based 
agreement on partnership had been removed and that it remained 
merely to work out purely technical trifles, pronounced progress 
in the working-out process is not in sight as yet--and the 
mutual hope of initialing an agreement "in the very near future" 
had been expressed at the summit. Nor are things any better with 
the GATT, the desire to join which Russia officially stated in 
July 1993, obtaining at that time the warmest assurances from 
the head thereof, Peter Sutherland, that all the procedures 
connected with this would be completed by the end of the year, 
just about. The same Mr. Sutherland, who recently no less warmly 
greeted Russian minister Oleg Davydov (see the material on page 
3), is still promising a speed-up in the same fashion. 
  The essence of the change, which had only just become 
apparent, was summed up by FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In the 
process of preparation of the meeting of ministers of finance of 
the Seven, which opened today in Frankfurt, Herr Kohl observed 
while the debate on the subject of whether to invite 
representatives of Russia was still under way that it would be 
far better to draw a demarcation line between the political and 
economic spheres of cooperation with Russia. That is, as a 
political partner (as long as there is the infamous nuclear 
button), Moscow could perfectly well become the "eighth," but in 
the economic plane it would have to rest content with the role 
of "manservant." 
  Not forcing as yet the development of economic topics, it 
was 
on the political front that Moscow dealt the West a powerful 
diplomatic blow--right in the "soft underbelly of 
Europe"--Bosnia--forcing the world to recall that it was the 
Balkan question that in the 19th century had raised Russia 
without any of your tedious economics to the level of Great 
Power. And judging by the fact that Boris Yeltsin's proposal 
concerning the convening of a summit on the Bosnia issue has yet 
to meet with a response in a single Western capital, the 
irritation with "upstart Russia" can no longer be concealed 
there. How are we not to surmise here that the United States 
timed the premiere of the drama of the Ames spy couple, which 
according to certain information had been rehearsed in 
Washington for several months (and Clinton knew about 
everything), to coincide with the moment when it was necessary 
to apply the "brakes" to Moscow in earnest. There have been many 
rows between the special services of Russia and the United 
States--they are commonplace--but they have assumed a political 
nature when the parties have categorically wanted to play a 
dirty trick on each other manifestly unrelated to the field of 
espionage. At this time, on the eve of a new round of 
negotiations on questions of assistance to the Russian reforms, 
the United States evidently deemed it convenient to "correct" 
the Russian image somewhat. And, as a matter of fact: The West 
is striving with might and main to render Moscow assistance, but 
it is paying spies and, yes, murderers (they have betrayed CIA 
agents, who in Russia are usually executed) and traitors. Quite 
an idea. It is put thus far at the $2.5 billion promised Russia 
this year by the United States. Who else is there? What is 
striking at first glance is the dissonance of the speeches on 
both sides of the ocean. With us everyone, to a man, is saying 
that there is nothing so bad about this--we have spied, we are 
spying now, and we will continue to spy. But Clinton pouted, 
hinting that his grievance was sincere--there had been hints 
given to him of something or other in Moscow in January, but 
they had not kept their word. 
  The bear generally is, as we all know, a phlegmatic 
creature, 
albeit powerful. It does not react to trifling matters. 
Specifically, the CIA delegation that came to Moscow, although 
having attempted to discuss the subject of espionage at the 
highest level, has received no response as yet. This response 
may, evidently, be read between the lines of Boris Yeltsin's 
report to parliament. It is, meanwhile, being read.

<F P=106> [Article by Alexei Novikov: "American Aid for Americans, </F>
Leftovers for Russians"; first paragraph is introductory 
paragraph] 
  [Text] Lately, the West's financial aid to Russia has been 
a favorite topic of both journalists and politicians in the 
majority of developed nations, with views on this question often 
extremely polarized. Some, in the heat of political romanticism, 
venture to prove that it is the West's sacred duty to help 
Russia, others see this as useless waste of resources, still 
others are convinced that this aid gives the West the right to 
lay claims to part of Russia's sovereignty and demand 
"obedience" from it. 
  These days the viewpoint of those advocating a reduction of 
American aid to Russia has unexpectedly been buttressed by the 
scandal which flared up in Washington over the arrest of the 
Ames couple who sold information to Russian intelligence. This 
has given an occasion for many American legislators to demand a 
freeze on the aid program on the grounds that while the United 
States has been heaping favors on the ungrateful Russia, the 
latter has brazenly continued spying against it and, moreover, 
paying for the traitors' services with that very same American 
money. 
  The ethical and logical character of such lamentations is a 
matter for special discussion. Now, however, let me discuss 
something different. Let us suppose that the USA has really 
frozen its contributions to our reforms. Who will this hurt -- 
Russia? Hardly. 
  Highly indicative is the analysis made in early March by 
The Wall Street Journal, in an attempt to sort out 
how the money allotted by the US administration to Russia is 
being spent, whom it is spent by and for what purposes. 
According to the newspaper, when the United States promised to 
allot for the former USSR 5.8 billion dollars a large part of 
which was meant for Russia, "there was dancing in the streets 
from joy at this decision, but not in the streets of Russia. Who 
mainly celebrated this event? Whole hordes of American 
consultants who were about to seize a large part of the `pie' of 
American aid." 
  Business in the field of "useful recommendations" amounts 
perhaps to one of the most lucrative in present-day Russia and, 
most importantly, does not carry the slightest element of risk 
-- first, money is being pumped out of the US government and, 
second, the worse things are in Russia, the bigger the gain in 
the long term. It is not for nothing that at the US Agency for 
International Development (AID), which controls nearly the 
entire package of aid granted by the USA, as many as 1,200 
consultants have submitted applications for participation in 
this program, which is a record high for the AID in its 33 years 
of existence. 
  As estimated by The Wall Street Journal, from 50 
to 90 percent of the money granted Russia under any specific aid 
contract lines the pockets of consulting firms. All this is done 
so brazenly that it cannot deceive anyone, even in the USA. It 
is this that compelled Marshall Goldman, a well-known expert on 
Russia, to state recently to the US Congress that the aid 
granted Russia, at the hands of American consultants and 
"Beltway bandits," "brings minimal aid to Russians, and perhaps 
nothing useful comes from this at all." 
  Perhaps it is only at first glance that the passage about 
"beltway bandits" will seem too harsh, but only at first glance. 
It is enough to take a look at some figures to understand and 
forgive the unintellectuality of this thrust. The Sawyer/Miller 
Co. which organized what the Americans themselves saw as a 
useless act with TV ads on privatization received seven million 
dollars for its implementation. Its representative in Moscow, 
Marc Mellon Brown, demanded from AID a salary of 1,150 dollars 
daily for his titanic labors, though, it is true, his request 
was turned down. The point is that AID permits its consultants 
in Russia to be paid no more than 380 dollars per day which, 
considering pension benefits and overhead expenses, amounts to 
800 dollars per day. And, naturally, from money designated as 
aid to Russia. 
  How many of our helpers' "problems" are being solved in 
practice can best of all be observed at Moscow's 
Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel. A Wall Street Journal 
correspondent described this as follows: "On a recent evening a 
string quartette was playing in the foyer -- a hall with a 
marble floor --when a large group of American businessmen, many 
of whom were aid consultants, were drinking and eating, not 
limiting themselves in anything. In the immediate proximity of 
them, on a frosty and dark street, about a hundred elderly men 
and women were wading through mud trying to sell their 
possessions -- a bottle of vodka or maybe a pair of shoes -- to 
passers-by." 
  It will be recalled that the famous Marshall Plan, which 
changed postwar Europe, deliberately minimized the role of 
American consultants. According to one of its architects, James 
Silberman, it was then found more effective and cheaper to bring 
to America 26,000 European economic managers and public figures 
who then returned to Europe with the restructuring methods they 
had received in the USA. As Silberman puts it, in those years 
indignation was evoked by the notion about American consultants 
not limiting themselves in expenses, well paid and "swimming in 
aid."

<F P=106> [Article by Grigoriy Selyaninov: "The New Turns Out To Be </F>
the Old That Has Not Yet Been Forgotten"] 
  [Text] The priorities in Russia's relations with the CIS 
countries become obsolete faster than they are formulated. From 
the president's message to parliament one could draw the 
conclusion that the integrationalists were gaining the upper 
hand in Russia, and the policies of the Burbulis-Gaydar cabinet 
were becoming a thing of the past. Then came the Gazprom [Gas 
Industry Concern] demarche (KOMMERSANT wrote about it on 3 
March), which put both Ukraine and Belarus in an extraordinarily 
difficult economic position. Yesterday daily gas deliveries were 
already cut in half, and today, despite Kiev's statement of its 
willingness to begin payments as of 5 March, Gazprom is 
promising to shut the valve altogether. The duality of Russian 
positions is also reflected in the epic of the unification of 
the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. 
  The Russian government's positions are dualistic in terms of 
both internal economic policy and the building of an economic 
union within the CIS framework. The only common feature appears 
to be the fact that one thing is stated while something entirely 
different happens in practice. Promises to repay debts to the 
budget-financed sector, the military-industrial complex and the 
agroindustrial complex are accompanied by a harsh criticism of 
the budget, while the Ministry of Finance's version of the 
budget is based on extremely strict criteria. Contacts with the 
former fraternal republics appear the same way: Viktor 
Chernomyrdin holds a semiconspiratorial meeting with his 
Belarusian colleague, but after it the pace of Belarus's joining 
the Russian monetary system does not speed up in the least. It 
turns out that use is being made of the principle: what I say is 
entirely different from what I do (what I think remains unknown). 
  Yet in relations with the CIS and in domestic policy a 
unified set of policies needs to be worked out. In light of 
recent events, one may assume that the gap between actual policy 
and official declarations will be, at the very least, preserved. 
This is indirectly confirmed by the sharp increase in the degree 
of secrecy with which the Russian departments are concealing 
their plans with regard to relations with the CIS. 


Russia's Economic Relations With the CIS in 1993 

CIS countries         Trade in          Percentage of       Allocation of 
                      billions of       Russia's total      state credits in 
                      rubles            trade               billions of 
                                                            rubles

Belarus               4,171             18.5                38.0 

Kazakhstan            3,800             16.9                11.55 

Kyrgyzstan            320               1.4                 8.0

                                                            60 (cash) 

Turkmenistan          280               1.24                0 

Uzbekistan            1,761             7.8                 30.0 (including 
                                                            20 billion cash) 

Ukraine               11,012            49.0                69.5 

Georgia               68                0.35                1.5 


  In 1992-1993 the Russian government reached a clear 
understanding of priorities with regard to Russia's interests in 
the CIS, an understanding which was subsequently called 
"isolationism." The contribution that 1994 makes to the 
situation may be the very same strategy in camouflaged political 
dressing. For all practical purposes, that is the approach that 
is defended by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry on Economic 
Cooperation With Member-States of the Commonwealth, and the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The industrial lobbies 
and, in part, the regional lobbies oppose it. After encountering 
nonpayments, they have been putting pressure not on their 
partners in the CIS, but primarily on the Russian government, 
through whose credits to the debtor countries financing is 
opened up for them, too. It is typical that at the beginning of 
the year Yuriy Shafranik stated at a meeting of his ministry's 
collegium that it was more profitable to export oil to the CIS 
than to Western Europe. The Central Bank is also in solidarity 
with the industrialists. Gazprom is so far the exception, and 
the shut-off of deliveries to Ukraine and Belarus could, in 
theory, prompt the industrialists to toughen their positions 
vis-a-vis the consumers of their products from the former USSR. 
  Consequently, Russia will be officially defending the ideas 
of continuing economic integration with an emphasis on the 
development of supranational structures, while striving to 
assume key positions on those agencies. On the other hand, in 
bilateral relations--and they are what determine real 
relations--Russia will, at the least, hold to its positions of 
1993: the preservation of customs duties on energy resources, a 
rigid arrangement for granting credits and the repayment of them 
(the indexation of credit amounts through the dollar, the 
determination of interest rates through the libor [London banks' 
short-term interest rate], and the requirement of an insurance 
deposit in hard currency), with the right to write off defaulted 
debts without requiring acceptance). Possible alternatives to 
present transportation routes for Russian export cargo that 
would bypass the Commonwealth countries are also being studied.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhova: "Moscow Changes Tactics in </F>
Relations With Hanoi"] 
  [Text] Yesterday in the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations a protocol on commodity deliveries between 
Russia and Vietnam in 1994 was signed that will substantially 
increase both the types of products delivered and the number of 
facilities built by Russia in Vietnam (which created a small 
sensation). This week Moscow carried out an "offensive" across 
the entire line of the "Vietnamese front": on Thursday talks 
were also held between the chiefs of the two countries' general 
staffs. The discussion focused on questions related to the 
servicing of the Russian military base at Cam Ranh. 
  After the removal of the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam, 
Russia, remembering the losses of many East European and Asian 
markets, decided to change its tactics for the protection of its 
interests in that country. And although, according to Mikhail 
Fradkov, first deputy ministry of foreign economic relations, 
Russia has not yet felt competition from the United States in 
the Vietnamese market, Moscow has already felt a slight chill in 
relations with the "Hanoi comrades." And in order to ensure 
against possible unpleasantness in the future, Russia has placed 
its stakes on not only preserving but expanding the spheres of 
cooperation. 
  As a KOMMERSANT correspondent learned, the greatest 
difficulty in the talks was caused by the problem of Vietnamese 
indebtedness (its the overall volume today comes to $10 
billion). And that is why Mr. Fradkov called the decision to 
reinvest at least part of it in setting up joint ventures in 
Vietnam ($80 million worth) the "Russian delegation's greatest 
success." Two Russian-Vietnamese joint ventures for the 
production of latex and activated charcoal were chosen as 
targets of investment. It was possible to reach agreement for 
part of current indebtedness to be paid in the form of 
deliveries of goods ($70 million worth). 
  On the other hand, in the opinion of [Le Suan Chin], the 
head 
of the administrative offices of the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam government, the Vietnamese side's main victory was to 
get a considerable expansion of the list of mutual deliveries of 
goods in 1994, as well as the list of industrial facilities in 
Vietnam whose construction will be carried out with Russia's 
assistance. However, whereas such construction was financed with 
Soviet state credits during the existence of the USSR, today all 
projects are being financed jointly by Russian and Vietnamese 
firms. And since both sides' funds are limited, in the talks a 
decision was made for Russia to take part in an international 
bidding for Vietnamese facilities (international organizations 
will serve as the sponsor in them). The new projects will 
include the construction of the [Yali] Hydroelectric Power 
Station and several electric power networks and roads. 
  The question of debt was also addressed in the talks between 
Mikhail Kolesnikov, the chief of the general staff of Russia's 
Armed Forces, and his Vietnamese colleague [Dao Dinh Luen], in 
which First Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey Kokoshin also took 
part. The problem is that, according to an intergovernmental 
agreement, the Vietnamese side is supposed to cover all expenses 
for the maintenance of the Russian material and technical supply 
center (read Russian Navy base) at Cam Ranh and credit them 
toward repayment of its debt. So far use of the base has been 
free for Moscow, but it is not out of the question that as the 
debt gets repaid, Hanoi will more and more insistently press the 
question of rent for Cam Ranh (which it prefers to speak of so 
far in Aesopian language). 
<H6>  Some Figures on Cooperation Between Russia and Vietnam </H6>
  In 1993 trade between Russia and Vietnam came to $500 
million 
(this year the plans are to raise it to $1 billion). 
  Russia's principal spheres of activity in Vietnam are power 
station construction (two hydroelectric power stations--the 
[Chan] and the [Khuabin]--and the [Faley] Thermal Electric Power 
Station are already in operation, and the [Yali] Hydroelectric 
Power Station is under construction) and petroleum extraction.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Agapov and Marat Salimov: "Nakhodka </F>
Rejects the Status of Free Economic Zone"] 
  [Text] The administration of Maritime Kray has supported 
the idea of Nakhodka's industrial circles, which, having become 
major private owners as the result of privatization, intend to 
create local free economic zones at their enterprises. Yesterday 
letters from Maritime Kray Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko 
containing a request to support the idea of establishing free 
economic zones on the territories of individual Nakhodka 
industrial enterprises were delivered to the apparatus of the 
president and prime minister. Thus, for all practical purposes 
Nakhodka is rejecting the status of free economic zone 
previously granted to it as an administrative territory. Up 
until now, not a single one of the free economic zones has made 
such proposals. 
  The idea of establishing local free economic zones reflects 
the desire of the directors of major industrial enterprises who 
have become owners of them as the result of privatization to 
strengthen their positions by obtaining special status for the 
industrial zones they control. Their initiative is actively 
supported by the administration of Nakhodka and Maritime Kray. 
However, it is fairly unlikely that it will be approved by the 
federal authorities. 
  The prospect of establishing microzones was considered for 
the first time during a Maritime Kray visit by Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy, chairman of the Yabloko parliamentary faction, to 
Nakhodka, where he held a meeting with representatives of the 
city administration and industrial circles. At that meeting 
local industrialists made their concept of the development of 
the Nakhodka Free Economic Zones public for the first time. 
  Thus, Viktor Gnezdilov, head of the city administration, 
stated in a discussion with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy that, since the 
idea of developing the free economic zone as a unified complex 
of industrial and agricultural territories had so far not found 
support in the structures of federal authority, the free 
economic zone's new administration considered the strategy of 
developing local zones around Nakhodka's major enterprises to be 
more effective. 
  According to that concept, in place of the Nakhodka Free 
Economic Zone, about eight enclave zones, including the Nakhodka 
Commercial Port Zone, the Vostochnyy Port Zone, the Nakhodka Tin 
Can Factory Zone, and the Reinforced Concrete Structurals Plant 
Zone, should be established. 
  Despite the fact that the heads of the city administration 
and executives of local enterprises are putting forward the 
concept of local free economic zones, what evidently would be 
involved are duty zones, the conditions of operations in which 
fully meet the ambitions of Nakhodka enterprise executives. 
  KOMMERSANT: In Russia the regulations for duty-free 
zones that have been legislatively approved provide for the 
possibility of placing and using imported goods in them without 
regard to customs duties and taxes. What is attractive about 
duty-free zones, for both Russian and foreign businessmen, is 
not just the fact that imported goods may be kept on their 
territories without customs inspection for as long as one likes, 
but also the fact that production operations may be carried out 
in them and, in such cases, export duties, the value-added tax 
and excise taxes will be based only on the components that were 
brought in from elsewhere in Russia. 
  World experience indicates that, because of the half-way 
nature of the special breaks established by legislation, 
duty-free zones have not been an effective tool for attracting 
investments. In this connection, the idea of establishing 
microzones around major industrial facilities could not result 
in fundamental changes in the socioeconomic situation in 
Nakhodka. From every indication, those who have initiated the 
idea of establishing local zones are also guided, first and 
foremost, by their own "local" interests, which square poorly 
not only with federal goals but with the objectives of regional 
development. Such a situation is a result of privatization, 
whereby the executives of the leading enterprises received large 
packages of stock in the new joint-stock companies and, for all 
practical purposes, became the owners of their enterprises. 
Following that, in December 1993, the representatives of the 
industrial lobby, in alliance with the city administration, took 
over the leading positions on the free economic zone's 
Administrative Committee. 
  As strange as it may seem, the idea of local zones was 
supported by the Maritime Kray administration and the kray 
governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko. The kray authorities' interest in 
establishing the microzones is understandable--such zones, only 
very nominally oriented toward federal structures, would be 
tightly linked to local authorities who controlled their power 
supply and utilities. Moreover, the establishment of a network 
of "growth points" on the basis of the kray's strategic 
enterprises could become a pretty good substitute for the 
separatist idea of singling Maritime Kray out as a separate 
enclave "growth zone." 
<H6>  Stages in the Development of Free Economic Zones in Russia </H6>
  1991: The status of free economic zones is granted 
to nine territories on the scale of oblasts and republics within 
Russia. 
  1992: The status of free economic zones is granted 
to three more regions. 
  1993: All free economic zones with the exception 
of Kaliningrad Oblast are deprived of duty breaks and 
privileges. The first three duty zones are 
established: Sheremetyevo, the Moscow Free Port and the Free 
Port Terminal. 
  1994: The Nakhodka Free Economic Zone rejects the 
status of a free economic zone and submits a proposal to 
establish four local zones that resemble duty zones 
on its territory.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Drozd: "The Head of the CSCE Delegation </F>
Maintains That the Kazakhstan Elections `Did Not Conform to 
International Standards'"] 
  [Text] A news conference of the international experts who 
followed the progress of the parliamentary elections in 
Kazakhstan was held on 8 March. 
  Representatives of highly influential international 
organizations--the CSCE, which sent members of parliament from 
various countries, and also the International Election Systems 
Foundation--an organization tracking election systems 
worldwide--had come to the republic specially. Having expressed 
gratitude for the invitation to observe the elections, Jaan van 
Hauvelingen thereupon declared: "The elections far from conform 
to the international standards accepted in the CSCE. The purpose 
of elections in pluralist free societies, that of the people 
being afforded an opportunity to determine their future, was not 
achieved. Our delegation was made up of nine persons 
representing France, Sweden, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, 
Lithuania, Germany, Turkey, Greece, and the Netherlands, and 
also the central machinery of the CSCE directly, and this is our 
unanimous opinion. In the course of the trip we have had an 
opportunity to meet both officials and leaders of public 
organizations, and to visit election precincts in Almaty, 
Kapchagay, Issyk, and several other places of the capital 
oblast. Six of our teams visited and had an opportunity to 
observe the election process at 50 polling stations." 
  Mr. Hauvelingen went on to dwell in detail on the actual 
reasons that made for the unsuccessful elections. He cited as 
the first of them the candidates' and, most important, the 
electorate's insufficient time for truly aware voting. "The 
system of registration of the candidates is very complex, and 
the district commissions excluded from the slates candidates, 
and the Ministry of Justice, political parties and grassroots 
movements, arbitrarily, frequently pursuing ends incompatible 
with fair elections," the CSCE representative observed. "The 
official slate constitutes 20 percent of the corps of deputies. 
So high a percentage of appointees, not elected persons, is a 
most flagrant breach of the principles on the basis of which the 
CSCE functions." He also emphasized that this runs counter to 
Kazakhstan's commitments, which the country assumed when it 
acceded to the Paris Charter and the Helsinki Act. The 
observers' particular criticism was evoked by the fact that one 
person would sometimes vote for several, not even presenting his 
papers, what is more. At some stations at which the foreign 
members of parliament were present, the number of such "dead 
souls" amounted to 35 percent. The existence of two electoral 
rolls (one at the station, the other in the district election 
committee) also left open the possibility of manipulation. Even 
the foreigners' fleeting acquaintance with our elections enabled 
them to uncover two instances of the portable ballot boxes being 
taken to the voters' homes, where they were forced to vote. 
  Nor was the campaign fair beyond reproach, in the words of 
the overseas experts. The dubious disqualification of many 
candidates was reflected in their assessments. The public was 
inadequately informed about the elections and the candidates and 
their programs. Election polls revealed the electorate's 
misunderstanding of the voting system. In the city of Kapchagay, 
which one team of observers visited, there were 13 open stations 
and three closed ones--at military facilities. Some 5,000 
persons--20 percent of the electorate--voted at the closed ones, 
but there was not a single observer or representative of the 
candidate present there. 
  The system of distribution of ballots elicited the experts' 
particular objections. In many instances, there were more than 
were necessary, and there was no proper count and destruction of 
the surplus ballots. The ballot boxes were not guarded at some 
stations. The portable boxes were located in an unmonitored 
room, and the observers were unable, try as they might, to 
establish strict control here. 
  The leader of the CSCE delegation observed also: "In all 
likelihood, the press was unable to publish material or to 
criticize violations in the course of preparation of the 
elections. Intimidation of independent journalists by the local 
authorities occurred in some instances. This was manifested 
particularly obviously in Almaty and Karaganda." Summing up what 
he had said, Mr. Hauvelingen confirmed once again that all this 
prevents the elections in Kazakhstan being deemed sufficiently 
democratic. More than 10 points of the Election Charter were 
violated. 
  He distinguished as positive aspects the very aspiration of 
Kazakhstan to free elections and also the openness of officials 
in the leadership of the country and the Central Electoral 
Commission, who are capable of dialogue and of making revisions 
to the election system. 
  Representatives of the International Election Systems 
Foundation declared that they would not venture to defend the 
elections in court. The voice of the citizens of Kazakhstan 
simply was not, in their opinion, heard in full. Amat Radevegan 
and Linda Enborg subscribed fully to the assessments made by the 
CSCE parliamentary delegation. At the same time, they presented 
their own opinions also: They criticized the Election Code, 
which has obvious shortcomings, and also the practice of its 
application. All those whom the foundation's representatives met 
in the republic--political parties, observers, and 
officials--agreed with this, incidentally. The diktat of the 
local district commissions was observed in the course of the 
elections. The Central Electoral Commission was severely limited 
also in its opportunities for intervening in the process of 
registration of the candidates and monitoring the local 
commissions. Thus, 135 election standards, matching the number 
of electoral commissions, had taken shape in Kazakhstan. A 
necessary solution for the future, according to Madame Enborg, 
could be coordination vertically, with full responsibility being 
entrusted to the Central Electoral Commission. 
  Many violations were connected, as representatives of the 
foundation observed, with the fact that commissions, attempting 
to ensure the necessary 50 percent turnout, permitted one family 
member to vote for all. But there were stations and commissions 
that performed their duty impeccably. The present elections were 
for all that, therefore, a step toward democracy. 
  Such harsh evaluations by the international observers could 
not have failed to have given rise to journalists' questions. 
The first was as follows: "....Do you not think that the 
president should cancel these elections?" Responding, Mr. 
Hauvelingen said that he hoped that Kazakhstan, as a member of 
the CSCE, would heed the delegation's opinion and take account 
of its observations, making the appropriate changes for the next 
elections. 
  Responding to a question as to who should be held 
responsible 
for the unfair elections, the leader of the delegation said that 
this was for the people of Kazakhstan and the new parliament, 
not the foreign observers' mission, to decide. 
  The foreigners' evasiveness as regards specific conclusions 
which might follow as a result of what had been said is 
perfectly understandable. But it is clear even now that 
Kazakhstan will once again get a parliament which it will be 
hard to call one that is legitimate and that truly expresses the 
will of the citizens of the republic.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Drozd: "The Chairman of the Central </F>
Electoral Commission Refutes the Statement of CSCE Observers. He 
Acknowledges `Merely Isolated Violations of the Election Code'"] 
  [Text] Not long before the elections, Karatay Turysov, 
chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, said at a news 
conference that he would not be afraid of the foreign observers, 
because they were "all proper people." 
  But postelection reality quickly forced him to alter his 
opinion. The news conference held in the Central Electoral 
Commission on 10 March was devoted practically entirely to a 
polemic against the conclusions of the CSCE parliamentary 
mission delegation, which evaluated the Kazakhstan elections as 
not entirely democratic or fair. Journalists' questions were 
answered by Tuleutay Suleymenov, minister of foreign affairs, 
Justice Minister Nagashbay Shaykenov, Press Minister Altynbek 
Sarsenbayev, and Procurator General Zharmakhan Tuyakbayev, 
together with the leadership of the Central Electoral Commission. 
  Mr. Turysov, who was the first to speak, said: "It is my 
pleasure to share with you the preliminary election results. 
Unconditionally democratic free elections were held in 
Kazakhstan. Despite skeptics' forecasts, the data at our 
disposal at this time indicates that no less than 75 percent of 
the electorate of the republic took part in the elections. 
Almost 7 million persons went to the polls. We may now say that 
the elections were held in all 135 head-to-head constituencies. 
In some oblasts the public displayed an enviable assertiveness: 
There was a turnout of more than 80 percent of eligible voters 
there. Only in Karaganda Oblast did this indicator constitute 
less than 60 percent." Having touched on the qualitative 
indicators of the future parliament, Mr. Turysov adduced certain 
figures. Thus, the new parliament will have 14.5 percent women, 
which is not bad if compared with the analogous figures in the 
parliaments of other former Soviet republics, and 172 
deputies--the vast majority--have higher education. Turysov 
highlighted particularly the presence among the future members 
of parliament of 18 "pure" lawyers and 15 "pure" economists, 
which, in the opinion of the chairman of the Central Electoral 
Commission, points to the significant professional potential of 
the future Supreme Council of Kazakhstan. 
  Mr. Turysov dwelt on the political orientation of the future 
legislators. Seventy-five deputies representing public 
associations had been elected to parliament altogether, 
according to him. Thus, the seats are distributed among them as 
follows: the SNEK [Union of People's Unity of Kazakhstan], 30 
seats; the Federation of Trade Unions, 11; the People's Congress 
of Kazakhstan, 9; the Socialist Party, 8; the Harmony Public 
Movement, 4; the Republican Party, 1; and the Democratic 
Committee for Human Rights, 1. Several seats were obtained by 
veterans and other less politically engaged public associations. 
The figures cited by Turysov did not take account of 
independents or the official slate. Altogether, the chairman of 
the Central Electoral Commission estimated, the SNEK could 
control in the future parliament approximately 45 seats. At the 
same time the future parliament, according to the information of 
the Central Electoral Commission, will have quite a sizable 
opposition stratum. 
  Speaking of the national composition of the future 
parliament, Karatay Turysov adduced the following figures: 58 
percent of the future deputies will be Kazakhs, and the national 
representation of other nationalities is exceptionally broad: 49 
members of parliament are Russians, and there are 10 Ukrainians, 
3 Germans and Jews, and representatives of the Tatars, Ingush, 
and other nations of Kazakhstan. 
  Having done with the figures at his disposal, the chairman 
of 
the Central Electoral Commission turned to the polemic with the 
members of parliament of the CSCE. He said: "I would first of 
all like to thank all the international observers for their 
assistance and recommendations in the organization of the first 
free parliamentary elections in independent Kazakhstan. I would 
like to make particular mention of the work of the 
representatives of the International Democratic Institute of the 
United States, who spent the most strenuous pre-election time 
with us." He then dwelt directly on the work of the CSCE 
delegation. First of all, Mr. Turysov highlighted the 
statements, which came as a surprise to him personally, made by 
the European members of parliament. He emphasized: "We invited 
them. They were guests, and there are elementary ethics 
preventing guests from passing remarks without having forewarned 
the hosts." The chairman of the Central Electoral Commission 
went on to observe that there is the Foreign Observers Statute, 
which does not allow them to hold such news conferences. 
  Mr. Turysov also harshly criticized all 10 observations of 
the CSCE. Concerning the lack of time for democratic choice, he 
called attention to the fact that two months had been allotted 
for the elections in Russia compared with Kazakhstan's three and 
that "the CSCE did not deem this a violation," and the local 
election code was adopted by parliament entirely in accordance 
with the letter and spirit of the law, of which there was not a 
trace in Russia, what is more. Mr. Turysov also rejected the 
charges of complexity and arbitrary action in the registration 
of candidates and parties. 
  Everything, according to him, was done fully in accordance 
with the election code, and the Ministry of Justice was not in 
the course of preparation for the elections required to register 
anyone. "It is hard to escape the feeling," Mr. Turysov said, 
"that the CSCE observers were guided not by knowledge, but by 
conjecture." "In addition, I see in the fact that more than 700 
candidates were registered here elements of a strengthening of 
democracy and the formation of a genuine multiparty system. The 
assertion that an official slate is exclusively a Kazakhstan 
phenomenon is wrong also." This was employed, according to Mr. 
Turysov, both in Poland and in Romania (the chairman of the 
Central Electoral Commission forgot to mention, it is true, that 
there the electorate could reject such a list and cast its vote 
for the slate of parties or public organizations). In addition, 
as the chairman of the Central Electoral Commission believes, it 
was far harder for the candidates on the official slate than for 
the candidates from head-to-heat constituencies--considerably 
more people had to vote for the former. Karatay Turysov rejected 
the charges that the press had not had an opportunity to engage 
in campaigning. He was supported here by Mr. Sarsenbayev, 
minister for the press, who noted that all the newspapers of 
political parties and independent newspapers continued to appear 
unimpeded, whereas the official press, as a consequence of 
printing difficulties, had switched to publication three times a 
week. He also rejected the allegations that the observers had 
not been accorded access to the closed stations. "They did not 
apply to us. We would have agreed," the head of the Central 
Electoral Commission declared. 
  Mr. Turysov emphatically rejected the assertions that 35 
percent of the vote was obtained as a result of "family" voting, 
when one person voted for the whole household, saying that 
conclusions for the whole republic cannot extrapolated from 
several stations. The chairman of the Central Electoral 
Commission also called attention to the fact that the native 
voter is qualitatively different from the Western voter. "It is 
impossible to change the mentality in three months," he said. 
There was mention also of differences in the evaluation of the 
elections within the CSCE delegation itself. Thus, the Turkish 
representative has already stated his disagreement with the 
overall assessments of the parliamentary assembly. Nor was the 
representative of France in agreement with everything. 
  By the time of the meeting with the press, the Central 
Electoral Commission had received 57 complaints pointing to 
violations in the course of the elections, they had all, 
according to Mr. Turysov, been most carefully studied, and an 
appropriate response to each will be forthcoming. 
  Concerning the technical deficiencies in the organization of 
the ballot, Mr. Turysov observed that everything had been done 
precisely in accordance with the law and that there had only 
been isolated violations. The 10 percent reserve of ballots 
which had been given the district commission over and above the 
electoral roll was, in Mr. Turysov's opinion, a pronounced step 
forward compared with the 40 percent given in the stagnation 
times. 
  Minister of Foreign Affairs Tuleutay Suleymenov attempted to 
tone down the sharpness of some of the opinions of the chairman 
of the Central Electoral Commission, noting the usefulness of 
the institution of observers for the future of Kazakhstan 
democracy. If out of the 12 persons, five or six said that not 
everything was to their liking, this by no means signifies that 
contacts with the CSCE need to be abandoned. He insisted that 
the statement made by the European observers was the consequence 
of a well-meaning error, not of a biased attitude toward 
Kazakhstan.
