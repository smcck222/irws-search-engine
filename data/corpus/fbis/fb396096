  [Text] Umtata Feb 6 SAPA -- The Returned Exiles Committee 
has threatened to assassinate Transkei military leader Maj Gen 
Bantu Holomisa and African National Congress [ANC] leaders for 
alleged actions against committee members. 
  Controversial Returned Exiles Committee President Pat 
Hlongwane, told a Radio Transkei talk-show on Sunday [6 
February] his organisation was determined to track down and 
eliminate the top ANC leaders responsible for all the atrocities 
in ANC camps in Angola and Zambia. 
  Mr Hlongwane said Transkei military leder Maj-Gen Bantu 
Holomisa was also on their hit list because Gen Holomisa had not 
assisted with investigations into the death of returned exile, 
Sipho Phungulwa, who was allegedly gunned down by Umkhonto we 
Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- MK] members at the Ngangelizwe 
township outside Umtata five years ago. "We were on the verge 
of assassinating him (Gen Holomisa) the other year at the 
Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg, but we missed him," Mr Hlongwane 
said. 
  Mr Hlongwane called Gen Holomisa "a political prostitute" 
whom he said was appointed by South African Foreign Minister Pik 
Botha. The Transkei leader, however, had changed his allegiance 
to the ANC when Mr Mandela was released. 
  Asked about his relationship with the Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB], Mr Hlongwane 
said he had met the AWB leadership and attended a rally on 
Saturday. He said he had approached the AWB in a bid to secure 
arms to protect himself against threatened attacks by Gen 
Holomisa. 
  Mr Hlongwane said he would align himself with any party 
taking an anti-communist stance during the forthcoming elections.

  [Text] Pretoria Feb 7 SAPA -- The SA [South African] Police 
on Monday [7 February] and over the weekend swooped against 
suspected extremist terrorists of both the far left and far 
right, Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said. He said in 
Pretoria the arrests were made after more than six weeks of 
intensive invstigations into a series of far-rightwing terror 
attacks in the [Orange] Free State and the Western Transvaal. 
  Police on Monday arrested five suspects linked to 
far-rightwing organisations. Some were detained in Orkney and 
others in Welkom. 
  The SA Police over the weekend also arrested seven people, 
including five suspected Azanian Peoples Liberation Army 
members, in connection with the rifle and hand-grenade attack on 
a swimming pool in Richard's Bay, Northern Naal, at the weekend, 
Mr Kriel said. Three R5 rifles and two M26 hand-grenades were 
seized when the arrests were made in Stanger, Empangeni and near 
the scene of the crime in Richard's Bay. 
  Five right-wing extremists were detained in the Transvaal 
and 
the Free State and explosives and firearms were seized by the 
police. 
  Follow-up operations by the SA Police were still in progress 
and further arrests could be expected, Mr Kriel said. 
  During the swoop in Orkney, a suspect fired with a shotgun 
at 
members of the police through a closed door. A policeman, 
Sergeant Johan Jonker, was hit in the chest but escaped death 
because he wore a bullet-proof jacket. Police returned fire, Mr 
Kriel said, and the suspect was wounded in the arm. He was 
under police guard in hospital. 
  "These arrests, and many others before them, explode the 
myth 
cultivated by Mr Nelson Mandela and the African National 
Congress [ANC] that the SA Police is soft on rightwing 
terrorism. "Once again the SA police have demonstrated that 
they will act without fear or favour," said Mr Kriel. "These 
arrests should also serve as a serious warning to both right and 
left-wing extremists that the SA Police will not for a moment 
hesitate to act against anyone who breaks the law, regardless of 
political affiliation." 
  Mr Kriel believed it was time Mr Mandela paid constructive 
and credible attention to his "criminal self-defence units, 
which are trained by MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, [Spear of the Nation 
-- armed wing of the ANC]". If Mr Mandela was interested in 
fair play, he would apologise to State President F W de Klerk 
and the SA Police for his recent unfounded insults. "However, 
knowing Mr Mandela, this may be too much to ask, considering 
that objectivity is not one of his strong points," Mr Kriel said.

<F P=106> [Report by Nick Olivari] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the main street of Ottosdal, the Vierkleur 
[flag of the former Transvaal Republic, now used by right-wing 
groups] was flying high this week. The Western Transvaal 
farming town lies in the heart of an area that has seen at least 
29 sabotage attempts on train lines, ANC offices, power pylons 
and private property in the past two months. [passage omitted] 
  This week, intelligence sources said the rightwingers 
responsible for the sabotage campaign that has included targets 
in the PWV [Pretoria Witwatersrand Vereeniging] area, the Free 
State and the Western Transvaal, had clearly modelled themselves 
on the IRA. Using cells of only one or two members, they are 
completely independent and operate without orders. 
  ANC organiser Moses Mothupi said Wednesday's attack on the 
organisation's offices in Letsopa was a retaliatory raid for the 
distribution of ANC election posters the week before. 
Neighbours said they neither heard nor saw anything of the 
blast, though several residents had heard rumours of a 
mysterious white minibus cruising the township streets the night 
before. In Ottesdal itself, the townsfolk say it's too early to 
say who was behind he blast -- but they wouldn't be surprised if 
it was the ANC themselves. 
  The police in the Western Transvaal say they have had no 
luck 
so far in identifying anyone in connection with the spate of 
blasts in the area. Intelligence sources said they doubted any 
arrests would be made "unless the police get lucky." 
Intelligence officers are combing thousands of files in an 
attempt to identify radical rightwingers, but they frankly admit 
there is little chance of stopping the saboteurs unless a cell 
can be infiltrated -- something that has proved difficult in 
recent months. 
  The explosives used include home-made devices concocted from 
diesel fuel and fertiliser, but commercial explosives have also 
been used in several blasts. One intelligence source said 
outdated stock from mines was the main source. 
  Security forces are desperate to put an end to the bombings 
-- but intelligence sources say the right wing has the 
capability to "completely disrupt this country -- and there is 
little we can do about it". 
  "We don't have a plan to combat them, we are undermanned and 
our biggest problem is that everything we do gets leaked to them 
in advance," said one frustrated senior SADF [South African 
Defence Force] source, who believes the rightwing campaign will 
"get worse" as the election date nears.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Arresting Right-Wing Lawbreakers Urged--The Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans on 2 February says in a page-8 editorial that 
"law- abiding citizens cannot be blamed if they gain the 
impression that right-wing extremists are getting away with 
proverbial murder simply because they threaten violence and 
civil war. The storming of the World Trade Center last year was 
an obvious example of how no action was originally taken against 
the right wing." "A warrant was issued almost 2 months ago for 
the arrest of Willem Ratte, fugitive leader of the right wingers 
who occupied Fort Schanskop in Pretoria. Since then he has 
appeared at several right-wing rallies." "It would appear that 
the police are unwilling to take him in, perhaps also for fear 
of violence. This failure to act against the right wing is in 
sharp contrast with the early morning raid last year on the 
homes and offices of more than 70 senior Pan-Africanist Congress 
members. At that time the authorities did not hesitate to act, 
even at the risk of derailing the negotiation process." "We are 
not advocating intensified action against the right simply to 
try to create the impression that equally firm action is taken 
against both right and left, but when people, regardless of 
color or political conviction, break the law, they must be 
arrested and punished according to the law." 
  Police Must Earn Public Respect -- A second editorial on 
page 
8 says that "it is with increasing concern that we note 
admissions by policemen in the Rand Supreme Court that they lied 
during the police investigation into the shooting incident last 
year between bodyguards of the ANC's Mr. Walter Sisulu and the 
police." "It is beyond comprehension that policemen, who ought 
to know better, can place the whole police force under suspicion 
by such lies. As it is, the police are already going through a 
credibility crisis, which could increase as 27 April draws 
nearer. We do believe, however, that the majority of police 
strive honestly to live up to their motto, we protect and we 
serve. It is for their sake that we plead with all policemen: 
Always act in word and deed in a manner which will earn the 
respect of the public." 
  Intimidation Casts Shadow Over Democracy -- The Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans on 3 February in a page-8 editorial regrets 
that "it is a pity that the National Party [NP] could not 
present a `normal' election list because, according to President 
F. W. de Klerk, intimidation in black areas prevented this. As 
a result a shadow is cast over the deployment of democracy. If 
potential candidates are intimidated in such a manner, one can 
only imagine how much pressure there is on ordinary supporters. 
Mr. Nelson Mandela's repeated plea that the election campaign 
should be free and fair has apparently not reached the black 
communities, or is being ignored. Nevertheless, now that the NP 
has an election team, it must begin to use them visibly. 
Campaigning must not be done only by a handful of white party 
leaders. Black and colored people as well as Indians must 
become part of the voter recruiting effort. That is the best way 
of making a really new NP known." 
  Success for Joint East Rand Plan Urged -- A second editorial 
on the same page of the 3 February BEELD states that "the joint 
rescue plan for the black townships on the East Rand is of vital 
importance, not only for the tattered communities at whom it is 
aimed, but in a sense for the whole country. The East Rand plan 
is the first one drawn up after consultation with all political 
role players, the local community, and the security forces. For 
this reason it has a better chance of success that previous 
plans, even though success is not guaranteed. The black 
community on the East Rand is not the only one where the social 
fabric has been reduced to the point of total anarchy. Similar 
situations exist in parts of Natal and the Western Cape .... so 
what is being done now on the East Rand will have to be 
duplicated in several other areas. This East Rand rescue plan 
will, therefore, provide an early indication of whether the 
country has a chance of success in the massive task of 
stabilization and upliftment which must be tackled after the 
April election. If it succeeds, chances are good that the same 
success will be repeated elsewhere too. Failure will be a 
forecast of misery for virtually the whole country."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Tripartite Talks `Becoming Farcical'--The talks between the 
Freedom Alliance (FA), the African National Congress (ANC), and 
the government "are becoming farcical," according to the page-6 
editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 7 February. 
"Yet, unless there is agreement, the election will not be 
inclusive and the possibility of civil war will become more 
insistent." "Deadline after deadline passes." THE CITIZEN 
urges the negotiators to "stop playing political games with our 
future." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Banks Must Head Off ANC's Compulsory Lending Directives -- 
"It becomes increasingly clear that South Africa's major banks 
are going to have to take the initiative in ensuring that 
previously disadvantaged borrowers have greater access to loans 
than in the past," remarks Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 7 
February in a page-10 editorial. "If not, it is probable they 
will be forced to do so." The banks must "go the extra mile to 
head off the compulsory lending directives threatened by the 
ANC's draft Reconstruction and Development Programme." The 
banks "have prepared themselves to provide services to the 
nation's hitherto unbanked regions and have supported the 
Community Banking project," but the question is "whether or not 
they've gone far enough." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Advantages of Government of National Unity--"The government 
of national unity which will rule for five years after the April 
election may not be universally popular in the ANC, particularly 
with hardliners who would prefer an all-ANC government and want 
the NP [National Party] consigned to the scrapheap," notes 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 7 February in a page-6 
editorial. However, the new government is a "transitional 
system designed to alleviate white fears and reassure foreign 
investors nervous of the ANC and its communist allies, but it 
has practical advantages. It will provide continuity, not of 
ideology but of experience." "Wholesale change may be 
politically satisfying, but it dumps a wealth of experience." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  TEC Responsible for Peacekeeping Force Shambles--The bid by 
the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) to establish a national 
peacekeeping force "seems to be off to a shambolic start," 
points out a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 7 February. Expectations were perhaps ""too high 
several weeks ago when a ragtag group of about 3,500 recruits 
started training." "Much of the blame for the shambles should be 
laid at the door of the TEC. Many of its decisions are taken 
with undue haste and under pressure of deadlines. The 
impression is created little forward or thorough planning is 
done." The newly appointed commander of the peacekeeping force 
takes up his post "under the cloud of the Venda pension 
scandal." SOWETAN hopes he can "salvage the situation and 
create a force able to ease the country's transition to 
democracy."

  [Excerpts] The head of state continues his consultations 
with the active forces of the nation. This morning, it was the 
senior military officers' turn to be received by the president. 
The meeting, which took place at the presidential palace, 
centered around only one subject -- the devaluation of the CFA 
franc and the accompanying measures. 
  For three hours, senior officers of our Armed Forces 
listened 
attentively to President Soglo's message. The head of state 
explained at length the reasons for this unavoidable 
devaluation. He also stressed the effective taking of our 
destiny into our hands since Africa has ceased to be political 
pawn now that there is an end to the division of the world into 
blocs. Finally, the head of state stressed the need to consume 
locally produced items. To this end, he announced his plans to 
rehabilitate certain abandoned projects, such as the corn mill 
at Bohicon, the Save sugar factory, and Adjarala dam. 
  The head of state did not announce any spectacular measures, 
but his message went down well. The officers understood the 
head of state's explanation. [passage omitted] 
  The military officers used this occasion to present some of 
their grievances to the head of state. The meeting took place 
in a calm atmosphere. Concluding, the head of state expressed 
confidence in the future of Benin and Africa. We have the 
capacity to manage the situation, he said. 
  [Begin Soglo recording] We have acquired the habit of 
consuming what we do not manufacture. We must produce the 
things in our country that we can consume, whether it is sugar 
produced locally or in the subregion, whether it is 
horny....[pauses] There are a lot of things that we have which, 
either through snobbishness, by habit, or by laziness because 
somebody was buying it for us, we continue to consume. These 
are things that we do not produce in our country. Now we are 
being asked to look around us, to find out what we can consume 
locally. Little by little, we will take off again. I think 
this is the real problem we have to solve. If we decide on the 
spur of the moment to create our own currency in this period of 
disorder, we can do that, but we should have done that earlier 
so that we would have been used to devaluation. In countries 
like those in Latin America, there is devaluation practically 
every year. People are used to it and act accordingly. We have 
not known this for 46 years. That is why we have this traumatic 
feeling about devaluation. I think that the whole of Africa 
will have a reawakening, and I think we have the capacity to 
bear it. [end recording]

  [Text] Mogadishu, Feb 5 (AFP) -- A confidential United 
Nations report has accused warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid of 
plotting a massive attack against UN peacekeepers after US and 
other Western forces withdraw next month. 
  The classified intelligence report, obtained by AFP on 
Saturday [5 February], predicted fresh fighting among Somalia's 
warring factions or between Somali militias and the slimmed-down 
UN force after the March pullout. It said General Aidid, 
currently in Nairobi where he is officially holding talks with 
rival Somali factions, was "busy preparing for renewed conflict 
against United Nations military forces." 
  It said that if the Group of 12 factions opposed to warlord 
Mohamed Farah Aidid joined an interim administration to be 
formed under UN-sponsored peace accords, General Aidid's Somali 
National Alliance (SNA) faction would take up arms again. 
  The Group of 12 spokesman, self-styled interim president Ali 
Mahdi Mohamed, backed controversial US-led strikes against the 
SNA militia during the UN's abortive hunt for Aidid, abandoned 
after his fighters killed more than 70 peacekeepers including 
two dozen Americans. 
  "Recent reports indicate that if Ali Mahdi's 12-faction 
Transitional National Council (TNC) is established as planned, 
the SNA will restart the civil war as it feels that the TNC is a 
puppet government of UNOSOM (the UN Operation in Somalia)," the 
report said. 
  It said Aidid's faction "may be formulating a plan which 
involved a large-scale attack against the UN...intended to break 
the will of the contingents left here, forcing them to leave 
Somalia and showing that the SNA is in charge of Mogadishu."

independent sources confirmed there have been fierce clashes 
between government and UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] troops. A spokesman for the Angolan 
military said the UNITA offensive around Cuito had been 
anticipated and government troops have been fully prepared. But 
UNITA officials I spoke to in the city of Huambo early this week 
hinted that government troops have been [words indistinct] a lot

  [Excerpt] Fighting in Cuito has put in jeopardy the Angolan 
peace talks taking place in Lusaka. The Union of the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] is blaming the government for the 
cease-fire violation. UNITA is even questioning the 
continuation of the peace negotiations. Alcides Sakala, UNITA 
representative in Brussels, stated that his movement wants the 
dialogue but the government's attitude does not allow this: 
  [Begin Sakala recording] We believe there is no military 
solution for Angola's problem. We need to find a solution 
through negotiations, a peace solution. But for as long as the 
government persists in this irresponsible and criminal policy, 
we believe this is an attack, a serious attack on the Angolan 
peace process, and the government is still persisting in this 
irresponsible strategy. We believe that we need to find peace 
for Angola, we need to negotiate it. [end recording] [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Barron] </F>
  [Text] Just two weeks after its formation, the peacekeeping 
force due to be deployed in hot-spots around South Africa in 
five weeks' time is in a shambles. Top instructors have told of 
a collapse of discipline, desertion and drunkenness among the 
3,500 volunteers at the SADF's [South African Defence Force] De 
Brug training camp outside Bloemfontein. In addition, hygiene 
conditions at the base are inadequate and there are nearly 200 
cases of serious disease. 
  Now SADF instructors seconded to the force are so 
disillusioned that nine have gone on "strike", refusing to obey 
any orders that have anything to do with the National 
Peacekeeping Force (NPKF). One instructor was sent home on 
Friday and the others, according to sources at De Brug, "want 
out". At least 100 statements have been submitted by SADF 
volunteers who also want to return to their units -- and between 
60 and 80 percent of SAP [South African Police] volunteers have 
already left. A senior SAP source said about 40 percent of the 
police contingents from the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, 
Venda and Ciskei] states had also returned home. 
  The picture painted this weekend of the fledgling Peace 
Force, precursor of a fully integrated National Defence Force, 
is grim. It shows a disparate force crippled by lack of 
discipline and demoralized by a shortage of facilities and 
equipment. Career soldiers, charged with welding former enemies 
into a credible force to ensure free and fair elections, said 
the peace troops "do pretty much as they like". 
  "If a guy threatens someone or disobeys a command, there's 
nothing we can do. If you try to punish anyone and something 
happens, you're in trouble," said a senior SADF officer. Some 
MK [Umkhonto weSizwe, Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] 
members had refused to wear regulation overalls. About 45 
soldiers are listed as being absent without leave. 
  The worst incident occurred last Saturday night, when about 
600 MK soldiers, many drunk, began toyi-toying and shouting 
slogans such as "One settler, one bullet" and "Down with FW". 
They demanded on dead SADF member and one dead SAP member 
before sunrise, and at least two SADF instructors were 
assaulted. Terrified members of other groups refused to sleep 
in their tents. They slept in the bush and instructors had to 
persuade them on Monday to return. An MK colonel was asked by 
an SADF officer to mediate with his men, but he refused, saying 
he would be risking his life. 
  The temporary commanding officer, Colonel Fred Burger, could 
not be located that night and was unaware of the incident until 
the next day. Colonel Burger has been criticised by this 
officers and instructors for downplaying the situation for 
"political" reasons. 
  Compounding the difficulties is the way MK soldiers are 
apparently promoted from the ranks to senior leadership 
positions overnight. "We have at least one sergeant major of 19 
and at least one regimental sergeant major of 21," said the SADF 
veteran. 
  Because of a shortage of facilities, troops have been using 
showers and wash basins as toilets. There is only one bathroom 
for each company of 200 men. There have been about 40 cases of 
malaria and about five of cerebral malaria among MK soldiers. 
There are "easily" more than 100 cases of venereal disease and 
about 50 of TB. Alcohol abuse is a problem, with shebeens 
reportedly operating in the camp. 
  Colonel Burger refused to answer questions from the Sunday 
Times, and after threatening to call the Military Police, 
ordered us off the property. NPKF commanding officer Gabriel 
Ramushwana visited the camp last week and will hold a media 
conference on Thursday.

  [Text] Following his inauguration last week, the new 
president of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, has just appointed his 
prime minister. He is Anatole Kanyenkiko, former minister of 
public works and equipment in the government of President 
Ndadaye who was assassinated last October. Kanyenkiko, who is 
married and father of three children, comes from the Tutsi 
ethnic group and is a member of the main opposition party, Unity 
and National Progress Party [Uprona]. He hails from Ngozi 
Province, northern Burundi. Before becoming minister of public 
works and equipment he was mayor of Bujumbura. Mr. Kanyenkiko 
replaces Mrs. Sylvie Kinigi, also a member of Uprona. However, 
it was not an easy task to make the appointment. Here is

Kanyenkiko was not an easy one. The opposition did not make 
things easy for President Cyprien Ntaryamira. In the beginning, 
it was agreed that the president of the Republic would choose 
the prime minister after consultation with all political 
organizations and that the prime minister would come from the 
opposition party in parliament, that is Uprona, the former 
single ruling party. 
  While in the government of Sylvie Kinigi, Anatole Kanyenkiko 
consistently stressed the fact that he was from Uprona party but 
after realizing that the new president was going to choose Mr. 
Kanyenkiko, the opposition [word indistinct] that Kanyenkiko had

Mauritanian Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, as an observer. 
  Anatole Kanyenkiko replaces Sylvie Kinigi and must form a 
government as soon as possible in which the opposition will take 
up 40 percent of seats while the ruling Front for Democracy in 
Burundi and its supporters will take up 60 percent. [end

  [Excerpt] The head of state yesterday presided over an 
important cabinet meeting at the Presidency of the Republic. 
The cabinet members and he discussed the devaluation of the CFA 
franc. The cabinet members used the opportunity to express their 
desire to embark upon a new policy of diversifying our economy 
through the transformation of our raw materials locally. They 
suggested that the government should abandon extravagant 
projects and concentrate on agricultural and rural programs. 
For more details, let us listen to Patrice Nziengui, minister 
of communication, posts, and telecommunications in charge of 
relations with the assemblies and spokesman of the government, 
as he reads the communique issued at that meeting: 
  [Begin Nziengui recording] Under the distinguished 
chairmanship of his Excellency El-Hajj Omar Bongo, president of 
the Republic and head of state, a cabinet meeting was held today 
at the usual meeting room of the Presidency of the Republic. 
Before discussing the items on the agenda, the prime minister 
and head of government briefed the cabinet on the National 
Assembly plenary session held on 2 February which was devoted to 
the devaluation of the CFA franc. 
  The prime minister's address to the National Assembly had 
three goals: To inform the legislators about this very 
important matter, namely the devaluation, to take stock of their 
views on the issue, and to reaffirm the government's 
determination to harmonize relations between the government and 
the National Assembly. The prime minister expressed 
satisfaction with the frank cooperation demonstrated by the 
legislators. In view of the importance of the issue and its 
disastrous effects on consumption and the purchasing power of 
Gabonese nationals, the government stressed the need for a 
policy oriented toward local production which should be 
beneficial for our economy. 
  In this regard, the cabinet made it a point to reaffirm its 
determination to embark upon a policy of diversifying our 
economy through the transformation of our raw materials locally, 
in particular in the fields of timber production and 
agriculture. The government will also abandon extravagant 
programs and rather increase rural agricultural projects. 
Concerning compensatory measures suggested by France, the 
government noted with satisfaction that [words indistinct] has 
called on the government to work towards the total cancellation 
of Gabon's bilateral debt. Also, the parliamentarians made 
concrete proposals which are now being examined in the various 
ministries. 
  Examining the problem of price increases, the cabinet 
reaffirmed the need to ensure the respect of the measures 
earlier adopted. As part of compensatory measures following the 
devaluation of the CFA franc and upon the proposal of the 
minister of finance, the cabinet adopted a draft bill 
prohibiting any increase in the cost of transactions effected in 
the CFA franc as a result of the devaluation. This decree 
stipulates that prices fixed in agreements or contracts will 
remain unchanged after devaluation. Consequently, any increase 
in costs not provided for in transactions, and in particular for 
reasons connected to the change in the parity of the local 
currency, is forbidden. This decree became necessary in order 
to prevent speculation by owners of property and buildings who, 
in their desire to take advantage of the change in parity of the 
CFA franc, may be tempted to revise sales contracts that have 
been legally agreed upon. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Marie-France Cros and Eric de Bellefroid: </F>
"Monsengwo to LA LIBRE BELGIQUE: Electing the Prime Minister?"] 
  [Text] "Nobody has ever said that the prime minister was 
going to be elected." A few days before his appointment by the 
expanded Higher Council of the Republic (HCR, the transitional 
parliament), this remark is important, coming from Monsignor 
Monsengwo, the president of the institution. What is he doing 
in Brussels while in Kinshasa the HCR is putting the finishing 
touches to the transitional constitution and is preparing to 
choose the prime minister - - a bone of contention? But does 
Monsignor really want to be on the spot at the time of the 
choice, which is due to be made "in around 10 days?" This 
appointment "does not concern me...I do not want to wear the 
hat" of a politician or have the responsibility for the actions 
of a politician. 
<H5>  Right To Examine </H5>
  "The agreement relates to the appointment of the prime 
minister by the opposition. If the opposition is to elect the 
prime minister, the other camp must not have the right of veto, 
at most a right to examine, since we are acting by consensus. 
This right to examine may be purely negative in the sense that 
we could say -- as in the 20 December agreement -- that the 
Political Forces of the Conclave (Mobutuists -- LA LIBRE 
BELGIQUE editor's note) acknowledge their choice provided the 
person elected, whoever he might be, can respect the agreements 
in the formation of his government and in the administration of 
the state. That being so, it is not obvious that there should 
be a vote. These are the agreements and I am anxious that they 
should be respected." 
  So, what is the point of the candidates put forward in the 
past few days? "Many people want to be prime minister. There 
is even reason to be surprised at that in a situation as complex 
as that of Zaire today." 
<H5>  Reviewing the Timetable </H5>
  According to Monsignor Monsengwo, the election timetable 
"will have to be reviewed." Indeed, four months have passed 
since the adoption of the protocol which set the beginning of 
the Third Republic for 1 January 1985. According to the 
prelate, the stages of this will be "the constitutional 
referendum, then the presidential and parliamentary elections at 
the same time, then the regional and local elections. This can 
only happen when the institutions are in place, in other words, 
not just the transitional government, but the government, and 
the National Elections Commission," which will monitor the 
elections. 
  Will they be reliable? "All the necessary measures must be 
taken to ensure that they are: Access for all to the media, 
installation of a minimum of telecommunications to enable the 
people in the interior of the country to be able to follow the 
election campaign. That could be done in six months with help. 
Finally, we need national and foreign observers to monitor the 
process."

<F P=106> [Interview with Archbishop Monsignor Monsengwo, speaker of </F>
the Zairian Transitional Parliament, by Didier Grogna in 
Brussels; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Monsignor Monsengwo, architect 
of the dialogue, is currently in Brussels. The president of the 
Higher Council of the Republic [HCR]-transitional Parliament 
agreed to answer our questions at a time when he has decided to 
distance himself from the political mission he has fulfilled 
since his election as head of the Sovereign National Conference 
[CNS] more than two years ago. The archbishop of Kisangani also 
replies to those who have criticized his action in recent weeks. 
  [Grogna] Are the new institutions capable of bringing about 
reconciliation? 
  [Monsengwo] I obviously have confidence in the 
HCR-Transitional Parliament because the desire of people from 
all sides to form part of it shows a real desire for 
reconciliation, agreement, and harmony. Partisan interests have 
been set aside. In addition, this Parliament was installed 
following the institutional order of the CNS. There is no 
reason why it should not go well. 
  [Grogna] How is the situation developing? 
  [Monsengwo] The commissions have been formed, the committee 
for the drafting of the transitional institutional text has been 
set up. Its work should not take too long. The work will 
probably be completed in 10 days' time. We will then be able to 
proceed to elect the prime minister and form the government. 
  [Grogna] What was the decisive factor in bringing together 
the opposition and presidential circles? 
  [Monsengwo] Everybody realized that they were dragging their 
feet. The country could not remain in such a situation for any 
longer. The legitimate government had no real power. This 
state of affairs did not allow the country to function normally. 
In addition, the monetary reform precipitated economic decline. 
The politicians realized the urgent need for a compromise. 
<H5>  Involvement </H5>
  [Grogna] The CNS had already met with President Mobutu in 
July 1992 and a text had been published. It was recognized by 
all. That did not prevent deadlock. What enables you to say 
now that the problems have been smoothed over? 
  [Monsengwo] I think that the deadlock arose because a 
section 
of the Zairian authorities, rightly or wrongly, did not feel 
sufficiently involved in the institutional order of the CNS, 
although it had been adopted by all groups. The MPR [People's 
Movement of the Revolution] and the army did not sign. This 
situation made it impossible to run the country in harmony. 
There was fairly deep discord. We therefore advocated 
political negotiations with all groups to arrive at a "common 
agreement" -- a purely political reconciliation. 
  [Grogna] Do you really believe in Mobutu's involvement? 
  [Monsengwo] He has publicly pledged to be involved and knows 
that the whole nation is watching him. His honor depends on him 
keeping his word. 
  [Grogna] Is it not possible to fear new obstacles with the 
election of the prime minister, especially in view of the fact 
that Tshisekedi's UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress] 
does not seem to be prepared to join the HCR? 
  [Monsengwo] As far as I know, the UDPS does sit on the HCR. 
I do not see why Etienne Tshisekedi should not admit it. On 
the other hand, I am surprised that when discussions are taking 
place in Kinshasa, some people claiming to support the UDPS are 
staging demonstrations in Europe. There is reason to wonder 
what the point of that is. 
  [Grogna] Can Tshisekedi still be prime minister? 
  [Monsengwo] In a democracy, exclusion must be avoided. As a 
priest, I do not want to enter into arguments over individuals. 
I leave it up to the politicians to deal with this problem. 
  The opposition will choose its candidate. He will form a 
government which will seek the HCR's confidence. 
<H5>  Referendum and Elections </H5>
  [Grogna] What timetable will the HCR establish? 
  [Monsengwo] The transitional Parliament will have to carry 
out a vote of confidence in the government. When that has been 
done, the government and the HCR will draw up a minimum economic 
program which will enable the partners to help us. When that 
program has been drawn up, we will have to think of the 
constitutional referendum. Then move on to elections: 
Parliamentary and presidential elections first, then regional 
and local elections. 
  [Grogna] How long will that take? 
  [Monsengwo] That will have to be discussed. In the draft 
agreement, we made provision for 15 months to arrive at the 
Third Republic. But we have already wasted four of them.... 
  [Grogna] Is it reasonable to think of holding credible 
elections in Zaire? 
  [Monsengwo] It will obviously be very difficult. It will 
take at least a minimum of preparations relating to 
telecommunications, media access for all groups, the repair of 
short-wave radio, a minimum of opportunities to travel around 
the country, observers.... The government and the National 
Elections Commission will have to examine the possibilities with 
the help of friends. 

<H5>    Keeping in the Background </H5>
  [Grogna] You told the diplomatic corps that you were leaving 
room for secular people. Does that mean that you will leave the 
political stage? 
  [Monsengwo] Yes. Gradually. My mandate is due to run 
throughout the transitional period, but, in the absence of a 
major crisis, the presidency of the HCR will be ensured by the 
vice presidents in turn. I will keep in the background more and 
more. 
  [Grogna] Will you be able to abandon the HCR when the 
reconciliation starts? 
  [Monsengwo] If there is reconciliation, there is no longer a 
need for me. I intervened for almost a year to try to settle 
the crisis. If they reach agreement, the state will be able to 
function normally. 
  [Grogna] What do you expect from Belgium? 
  [Monsengwo] Belgium and the other partners have said that 
they are prepared to help Zaire when a credible government is 
installed. I think they will do so. However, they will probably 
wait until the administrators prove their honesty. 
<H5>  Political Troubles </H5>
  [Grogna] Amnesty International thinks that Zaire is in 
terrible trouble and many ethnic disturbances are taking place. 
Is this the result of the country's decline or a real political 
will? 
  [Monsengwo] The Amnesty International report does not 
surprise me. The country has never been in such a situation, 
even at the height of President Mobutu's tough regime. 
  In addition, I have never known ethnic troubles which were 
not of partisan political origin. It does not come from the 
people. 
  [Grogna] What do you say to those who accuse you of being 
the 
president of higher presidential circles or of having betrayed 
the CNS ideal? 
  [Monsengwo] I do not know whether those people have much 
information about Zairian politics. When those people were 
making those statements, we were reaching agreement in Zaire. I 
think that those people have never read the document containing 
the constitutional provisions. They do not know the spirit or 
the letter of it and have not followed the strategy established 
to ensure that the CNS is not betrayed. 
  [Grogna] In particular, some people have accused you of 
having sent faxes to Butrus Butrus-Ghali to advise him against 
allowing the Tshisekedi government delegation into the UN 
General Assembly.... 
  [Monsengwo] I have not sent faxes to the UN secretary 
general. I have only written to him once, in reply to a question 
on the dispatch of humanitarian aid. 
  If there are other faxes, they are forgeries and there is 
reason to wonder why some people want to deceive the world and 
disrupt public opinion.

<F P=106> [FDS report on interview with opposition politician Joseph </F>
Olenghankoy in Brussels; date not given: "`Without Monsengwo, 
Zaire Would Already Have Been a Democracy': Joseph Olenghankoy 
on Real and Alleged Opponents of the Mobutu Regime."] 
  [Text] Brussels--"If Monsengwo had not been there, with all 
his intrigues behind the scenes, then we would have won 
democracy long ago," according to a blunt Joseph Olenghankoy, 
aide to Etienne Tshisekedi. "In Kinshasa, there is more 
criticism of Monsengwo than Mobutu. Children throw stones at 
his black limousine." 
  Olenghankoy is one of the leaders of a new generation of the 
Zairian opposition--"young people who owe nothing to Mobutu," as 
he puts it. Olenghankoy is also one of the people behind the 
"dead city" protest action, with which the Sacred Union based 
round Tshisekedi occasionally paralyzes Kinshasa. In addition, 
Olenghankoy was one of the opposition negotiators in the talks 
held at the end of last year and the start of this year with 
Mobutu supporters on a new attempt at cohabitation. 
  That agreement was immediately misused by the Mobutu camp, 
even though it had not even been ratified by the agreed 
procedure. The High Council of the Republic, which took over 
the role of provisional parliament from the National Conference, 
was dissolved at the end of January and merged with the rival 
Mobutu parliament to form a broader, new High Council. The 
Tshisekedi supporters protest against what they see as this 
illegal course of affairs, but they are taking part in the 
discussions in the new council. They say an empty chair policy 
would be counterproductive. Now, Archbishop Monsengwo is the 
opposition's bogeyman. "Two Wednesdays ago, he called together 
the old High Council, in his capacity as its president," 
Olenghankoy said. "He told us two things. First, if we did not 
vote for the dissolution and expansion of the parliament that 
Wednesday, then there would be an armed intervention by Mobutu 
and we, members of the High Council, would be on welfare. 
Second, he presented us with a list of the salaries to be paid 
in the expanded High Council. Mobutu had agreed to a wage of 
$3,000 a month for every member. Imagine: People who have never 
seen $100 in their life are suddenly promised $3,000 a month. A 
majority voted for the dissolution of the old Council in a 
euphoric mood. Monsengwo knows the weak spots of the Zairian 
politicians: Everyone is hungry and therefore virtually 
everybody is for sale." 
<H5>  The presidential term of office is over </H5>
  And now? According to the Mobutu camp, the expanded council 
must quickly appoint a new prime minister and, for the 
president, that cannot be Tshisekedi. "Tshisekedi is the only 
leader to be elected legitimately since Patrice Lumumba," 
Olenghankoy said. "He was appointed leader of the government 
after debate in the National Conference and that decision was 
never undone by the High Council. Mobutu has no claim on 
legitimacy whatsoever: His former presidential term of office 
ended long ago. Tshisekedi does not have to be elected again. 
His position is not empty. The new High Council just has to 
reconfirm its confidence in Tshisekedi and his government on the 
basis of normal parliamentary rules." 
  If the politicians can be bought so easily, by Mobutu or 
Monsengwo, then it should be impossible to achieve a majority 
for Tshisekedi? "No," Olenghankoy said, "the prime minister 
must come from the opposition, according to the agreement. And 
the opposition still has a majority in the expanded High 
Council, which now has 784 members. Mobutu has already tried 
everything to break that majority, first in the National 
Conference and then in the High Council. But every time it 
really came down to it, he never succeeded in finding a majority 
against Tshisekedi. Even those who are said to be behind Mobutu 
only do so because of the money." 
  They call that "the politics of the stomach." Such politics 
mean that it is difficult to see who is in the opposition and 
who is not. "The real members of the opposition are those who 
opposed the dictatorship in the years when the great majority of 
our politicians still thought that Mobutuism would never end," 
Olenghankoy said. "Afterwards innumerable Mobutu supporters have 
fled to the opposition -- while maintaining their corrupt way of 
life, because it has become second nature to them. For me, they 
are not really members of the opposition. And we fully 
understand that many people round Tshisekedi continue to work 
for Mobutu. But ultimately they will not dare to oppose 
Tshisekedi. Because later the people will judge them in 
elections." 
  In Kinshasa, Olenghankoy himself once went to disturb a 
nighttime rendezvous between Monsengwo and a number of former 
barons of the regime who called themselves members of the 
opposition by day and conspired against Tshisekedi by night. 
<H5>  Wriggling </H5>
  He has unshakeable confidence in final victory. "The people 
want peace and democracy, and the people will in the end win the 
struggle against those who work for the status quo in Zaire," 
Olenghankoy said. "And the people are behind Tshisekedi. Our 
most recent `dead city' protest in Kinshasa was a referendum for 
Tshisekedi. Monsengwo can carry out his Vatican diplomacy, the 
monseigneur can bargain and maneuver, but even he cannot beat 
the people. Now even children understand that Monsengwo is 
wriggling, and that he is disappointing the original faith of 
the people." 
  "In popular districts there is so much criticism of him 
that a support committee has been set up for the archbishop," 
Olenghankoy said. "It includes Karl-I-Bond -- who, when he was 
still in the opposition, was Monsengwo's greatest opponent. Who 
else is in that support committee? Every one of them has served 
Mobutu: People who were indicted by name in the National 
Conference's reports on the dishonestly acquired goods and 
political assassinations. How can a priest, a representative of 
god on Earth, permit himself to be supported by corrupt brutes? 
And why do they support him? Because Monsengwo prevented the 
National Conference from drawing conclusions from these reports 
about corruption and repression. Within that committee, forces 
are working together which should be opposed to one another like 
day and night." 
<H5>  Mobutuism </H5>
  Once Olenghankoy got started, his tirade against Monsengwo 
would not stop. "He always travels and acts alone," he said, 
"without answering to the bodies of which he was or is 
president, for the last three years. Nobody knows who he speaks 
to or what about." Last week Monsengwo wrote a letter to the 
troika -- the United States, France, and Belgium -- who together 
are closely observing the developments in Zaire. They then 
confirmed their unconditional faith in him, despite the 
opposition in the Tshisekedi camp to the dissolution of the old 
High Council. "Monsengwo is still managing to prevent our 
partners from intervening resolutely," Olenghankoy said. "He is 
deluding them that he is following a third way between Mobutu 
and Tshisekedi, and that this way will ensure peace. In Zaire, 
no one believes him any longer." 
  Olenghankoy also denied that the troika was slowly 
distancing 
itself from Tshisekedi. He has just returned from the United 
States, where he had contacts at the very highest level. "And 
the Americans continue to adopt a very strong position against 
Mobutu," he said. "In their analyses they continue to attach 
great importance to Zaire, which is the richest country in 
Africa. The Americans know that Mobutu is no longer 
safeguarding their interests, on the contrary, he is damaging 
them." 
  "Mobutuism is like a virus which is spreading very rapidly," 
Olenghankoy said. "Now it has reached other parts of Africa. 
It kills its victims quickly and on a massive scale -- quicker 
than AIDS. Mobutu is creating trouble spots elsewhere in 
Africa, to distract the world's attention from himself. The 
Americans realize that. And the French also know that Mobutu is 
in the way of their interests. We cannot complain at all about 
Belgium: This country is fully backing up its conviction that 
Zaire must free itself from Mobutu." 
<H5>  Sacred belief </H5>
  All good and well, Monsengwo can do nothing right -- but he 
does not have an army at his disposal like Mobutu. And that 
army is keeping Mobutu in power. Right? Olenghankoy laughs off 
that line of reasoning. "To tell the truth," he said, "in the 
past Mobutu could never count on his army. And now he can count 
on it even less. He has no more than a small unit armed to the 
teeth. The DSP [Special Presidential Division] is not behind 
the president, in contrast to what people believe here. 
However, there is a small unit in the DSP, called the dragons: 
They are Mobutu's nephews, uncles and close relatives. 
Virtually all the other parts of the army have been disarmed by 
Mobutu." 
  "The Zairian army is the most ridiculous in the world -- and 
the impoverished military understands that," Olenghankoy said. 
"It is they who distribute our pamphlets. Nor are the security 
services undivided supporters of the president. They pass their 
information on to us as quickly as they pass it on to him. We 
have never played with the idea of taking power by force, we 
have chosen peaceful methods, but if the day comes when the 
people revolts -- and that day is approaching -- then it will be 
clear that Mobutu's army is useless. Even now he is virtually 
in exile in his own country: He is hiding in his native 
village, Gbadolite." 
  This sacred belief in the will of the people can surprise 
someone observing from a distance. Haven't the Zairians 
tolerated Mobutu for 30 years? And why should the starving 
people be more resistant to the 'politics of the stomach' than 
the politicians? "The people have a far more straightforward 
way of thinking than the politicians," Olenghankoy said. 
"Politics has become business, a form of prostitution: Many 
people are hoping to make their fortune by choosing for or 
against Mobutu. That is commerce. But the mass of the people 
cannot be bought off. In the popular neighborhoods there is an 
expression which is frequently heard: Dying is nothing, but 
living under Mobutuism is to die every day."

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 5 Feb (KNA)--His Excellency President 
Daniel arap Moi was today among mourners who attended the burial 
of the late chairman of FORD [Forum for the Restoration of 
Democracy]-Kenya, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, who was buried this 
afternoon at his home in Nyamira Kang'o in Bondo, Siaya 
District. The late Odinga, who was the official leader of the 
opposition in Kenya, died peacefully at the His Highness Aga 
Khan hospital in Kisumu on Thursday, January 20. 
  Addressing the mourners, President Moi described the late 
chief of opposition politics in Kenya as a great son of the 
country who never wavered in his love for the country. He added 
that even during his many trips abroad in his capacity as the 
leader of opposition, he never criticized his motherland. The 
president pointed out that when the late Odinga chose to 
cooperate with the Kenya African National Union [KANU] 
government it was for the sake of development in Nyanza Province 
and for the benefit of the Luo community in particular. 
  Saying that the differences in opinions did not erode 
friendship, the president recalled 1957, when both he and the 
late Odinga were in the Legislative Council, and the many 
valuable contributions they made towards the attainence [as 
received] of atmosphere for true democracy to thrive and enhance 
development. To this end the president stressed on the need for 
national unity, cautioning that Kenya was not a special country 
and could easily be torn apart unless that unity was upheld. 
  Speaking on behalf of the Odinga family, Odinga's elder 
brother, Mzee Tobias Ajuma Odinga, hailed his late brother as a 
peaceful man who loved all people. He disclosed that after the 
last general elections, the late Odinga approached him and told 
him that it was well that KANU had won and that FORD-Kenya was 
going to cooperate with the government. He therefore urged the 
Luo community and FORD- Kenya party to continue with that 
cooperation as per the wishes of the late Odinga. He added that 
in many occasions the late Odinga had referred to President Moi 
as his brother. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Jonas Savimbi [leader of National Union for the

from Houphouet-Boigny's funeral in Cote d'Ivoire by referring to 
the situation in Cuito. Despite that, Portuguese Secretary of 
State for Cooperation Briosa e Gala will take the opportunity to 
make some contacts concerning the war in Angola. More details

  [Torres] [passage omitted] All the journalists have been 
talking about Angola, but with the absence of Portuguese 
President Mario Soares and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, the 
expectation of some impressions being exchanged on the Angolan 
issue have vanished. Eugenio Manuvakola confirmed that Savimbi 
is being represented here by his sister and the UNITA secretary 
general, due to the escalation of the fighting in Angola. 
  Everybody was expecting Jonas Savimbi to come here because 
he 
had a strong friendship and polical links with the deceased 
President Houphouet-Boigny. 
  On the other hand, the Angolan Government sent a strong 
representation headed by the parliament speaker and the foreign 
minister. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Yamoussoukro, 8 Feb (AFP) -- African heads of state 
emerged from a mini-summit Monday [7 February] with France 
saying that up to now the devaluation of their currency, the CFA 
franc, had been going well. The CFA franc was devalued by 50 
percent after a summit meeting in Dakar on January 11 following 
pressure from the International Monetary Fund. The move led to 
wide-spread panic immediately after it came into effect in 
several of the 14 member states of the Franc Zone. But Ivory 
Coast Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan said Monday that the 
13 heads of state present for the meeting "trusted in the 
operation." "They believe it is an opportunity to emerge from 
crisis and to reach a level of economic growth." 
  The meeting also addressed the consequences of the 
devaluation, especially rising prices and the problem of debt, 
calling for France to provide more aid. French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur in a brief statement at the airport here said 
the meeting had ended on a "note of realism and optimism." He 
added the devaluation was not the end but a beginning. 
  After the January summit, France promised to put forward 
proposals to alleviate the debts still owed by the member 
countries. The mini-summit was held following the funeral of the 
Ivorian president Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who was given a 
sumptuous send-off Monday.

  [Text] Yamoussoukro, 7 Feb (AFP) -- French President 
Francois Mitterrand left Yamoussoukro (220 km northwest of 
Abidjan) today at 2115 GMT after attending the funeral ceremony 
of Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny and participating in 
the minisummit of countries of the franc zone.

  [Text] Fighting has again broken out between the Komkombas 
and Nanumbas in the Bimbila District of the Northern Region. A 
number of villages in the district have either been burned down 
or deserted. Scores of women and children were seen fleeing to 
Yendi, while men armed themselves and took cover in the bush. 
Students and staff of the EP [Evangelic Presbyterian] Training 
College, as well as workers of the Centralized Government 
Department in the town, have taken refuge at the police station, 
where there are Army and police detachments. 
  The Bimbila District secretary, Mr. Ismael A.D. Adams, has 
briefed the Northern Regional minister, Lieutenant Colonel 
Abdulai Ibrahim, and members of the Regional Security Committee 
who had gone to the area. Mr. Adams told them that reports 
indicate the fighting followed a misunderstanding between a 
Komkomba man and a Nanumba man over the sale of a guinea fowl at 
Napayili market. According to him, the owner of the guinea fowl 
was alleged to have refused the price offered him by the 
Komkomba man and sold it to the Nanumba, and this infuriated the 
Komkomba man who went to the Nanumba man's farm the next day and 
shot two persons. Mr. Adams disclosed that one policeman was 
killed and three others were seriously injured when they 
attempted to evacuate their colleagues from Wulinsi police 
station. He said the situation is purely a Nanumba-Komkomba 
conflict and has nothing to do with the recent attack on Bimbila 
police station. 
  Addressing students of the EP Training College and displaced 
people at Bimbila police station, the regional minister said the 
necessary steps would be taken to solve their problems. He gave 
the assurance that transport would be made available to evacuate 
them from the town as early as possible. The first deputy 
speaker of parliament and MP for Bimbila, Dr. Mohamed Ibn 
Chambas, said the government's attention would be drawn to the 
situation to deal with it promptly.

  [Text] The northern regional security committee has assured 
residents of Tamale that the military and the police are in 
control of the general security in the area and they can 
therefore go about their normal duties without fear. In a 
statement issued at Tamale, the committee requested the public 
to cooperate and warned that any person found involved in 
criminal activities would be severely dealt with. 
  The assurance came in the wake of fears generated by the 
general state of insecurity as a result of mob attacks on 
certain sections of the community since last week. The military 
and police have been deployed at strategic areas in the 
municipality to curb further acts of violence. Some 
reinforcements have also been dispatched to the East Gonja and 
Yendi Districts where fighting is reported to be still going on 
despite the call for cease-fire by the northern sector brigade 
commander of the Ghana Armed Forces. 
  According to people fleeing the fighting from Salaga, the 
casualty rate is high. In another development, Dagbon leaders 
in Tamale have formed a task force to help stop the burning and 
looting of property by irate mobs. 
  Meanwhile, a GHANA NEWS AGENCY report said that the state of 
insecurity had resulted in many people, mainly in the public 
service, leaving the municipality. Already all first and second 
cycle schools in the municipality have closed down following 
threats of mob attack. The National Mobilization Program [NMP] 
and the Red Cross Society in Tamale have, meanwhile, registered 
over 2,000 refugees who have fled the ethnic fighting in parts 
of the region. The refugees are mainly students, national 
service personnel, and displaced people, including women and 
children. The report said that about 600 of the refugees are 
camped at the Nyohene Vocational Center and are fed by the local 
community because the NMP and the Red Cross have nothing in 
stock. It said the rest of the refugees, who feel their lives 
are endangered in Tamale, are being kept in a military camp.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Lansana Conte with foreign and </F>
local correspondents in Conakry on 1 February, moderated by 
unidentified official--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent Isaac Maiga] I am Isaac Maiga of 
the Mali radio and television service. There is increasing talk 
of insecurity in the capital city, Conakry. What steps are you 
taking to put an end to this increase in banditry? My second 
question, Mr. President, is this: You have just been elected 
for a new five-year term. What are your priorities in the 
implementation of your manifesto? And my last question, Mr. 
President, what will the role of the Army be in the new Guinean 
democracy? Thank you. 
  [Conte] It is true that in our country today there is a lot 
of insecurity. Measures have been taken by the Ministry of 
Interior and Security to deal with this plague. You might have 
heard on the radio the measures that the Ministry of Interior 
has just taken to curb the activities of the bandits who 
represent a scourge in our cities. I think it is a long-term 
project. Insecurity in our country is so developed that it 
cannot be eliminated in one day but we have, in fact, made it a 
priority among our priorities in order to curb it. Even if it 
cannot be eliminated completely, we aim at least to drastically 
reduce the insecurity prevailing in our country, especially in 
the city of Conakry. 
  Now if you want to know the details of these measures, you 
can contact the Ministry of Interior, but I believe we do not 
even have to tell you the type of measures being taken because 
we should not warn these bandits of all the measures we are 
taking against them otherwise, as you know, they will take the 
appropriate countermeasures. So there are certain things we are 
keeping secret. 
  Now, concerning my priorities during my five-year term, they 
will first include the security we have been talking about, 
national unity, and the need for Guineans to work hard. They 
will also include the economic development of our country. We 
will use all the means at our disposal for our country's 
development beginning with the basis for development, 
agriculture. 
  In regard to the Army's role, it will maintain its 
traditional role. Under the First Republic, the Army was 
authorized to be involved in the political life of the country. 
The Army as we know has its own role that all soldiers know. 
It is this role that we are going to revive, that is, defending 
the territorial integrity of the country, therefore, defending 
our country. This is the task to which the Army will devote 
itself. The Army will not only defend our country but we should 
ensure that we are present anywhere we are needed in the West 
African subregion. We should be present anywhere in Africa, 
wherever we are needed, to defend the cause of peace. So our 
role is quite clear. We shall leave politicians to fight on the 
political field, and we shall fight in the military field. I 
believe if we carry out our work correctly in the Army, it will 
enable politicians to also carry out their work correctly. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Maiga] Mr. President, does this mean therefore that the 
Army 
will henceforth return to the barracks? 
  [Conte] But the Army has always been in the barracks! 
  [Maiga] I mean, Mr. President.... 
  [Conte, interrupting] Even in the First Republic the Army 
was 
always in the barracks; only a few soldiers were given civilian 
functions. Even in very developed countries, there are generals 
and colonels who assume civilian responsibilities. That does 
not mean that the Army is not in the barracks. You are always 
talking of barracks, barracks...do you think they are prisons? 
[laughter] The barracks are not prisons. They are places where 
soldiers live; but they are not obliged to shut up. They are 
free citizens like anyone else. [passage omitted] 
  [Pamissan] My name is Edouard Pamissan of the LE BUCHERON 
newspaper in Gabon. Mr. President, I would first like to 
highlight an exceptional event which is the one we are 
witnessing, that of a head of state holding a news conference 
with opposition reporters. I believe this does not happen often 
and needs to be highlighted. In your introductory speech, you 
dwelled at length on the media. You spoke on the role of 
journalists. This means you have confidence in the role of the 
media in a democratic regime. I would like to highlight a few 
points. 
  One of our colleagues of the national radio was molested by 
a 
soldier for participating in a march organized by the 
opposition. The other point is that when one listens to the 
national radio and television, one realizes that there is very 
little participation by the opposition. Talking about 
pluralism, which is one of the basic tenets of democracy, you 
said you would gradually set in motion an already existing 
mechanism. My question is this: Would it not be better to 
rather start with pluralism, which is the very basis for 
democracy and which allows for the expression of various ideas? 
Would it not be better to start the democratic process by the 
liberation of the media and the development of free expression, 
which are the basic tenets of democracy? Thank you. 
  [Conte] How should start the democratic process? By 
pluralism? 
  [Pamissan] Yes, I mean when one talks of democracy, one 
speaks of pluralism. Is pluralism not the very basis for 
democracy and freedom of expression? Would it not have been 
better to start from there? 
  [Conte] The essential thing is to attain one's objective. 
Whether one starts with pluralism or with freedom of expression, 
the essential thing is that we attain the objective we have 
assigned ourselves. We want freedom for everybody, especially 
the media. The media have been writing, the media have been 
talking. We do not see any inconvenience in what the media 
writes or talks about. We want our country to be genuinely 
democratic so that everyone can express himself freely. You 
have just said a soldier beat up a reporter because he was with 
the opposition. Did you ask the soldier and the reporter why 
they were fighting? 
  [Pamissan] No, Mr. President. 
  [Conte] Why do you judge people without listening to them? I 
am sure the reporter said something to the soldier that did not 
please him but he did not beat him up because of politics. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified moderator] Thank you Mr. President. Now, 
(Pierre Florent) of the Voice of America. 
  [(Florent)] [passage omitted] Are you going to invite the 
opposition to form a government of national unity? 
  [Conte] I have told you that I am not going to invite 
anybody. I am not going to call on anybody. Do not expect 
Africans to do what you do not do in your country. In your 
country when the president is elected he choses the men he 
likes. Leave us to choose the men we want to choose. Do not 
try to impose on us the people you want to see in government. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Moderator] A question of economic interest from the foreign 
media by the Africa No. 1 correspondent. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, I wonder whether 
the fact that Guinea does not belong to the franc zone today is 
a good policy or a bad one. That is my first question. My 
second question, Mr. President, is this: You have decided to 
personally ensure probity in the management of public property. 
Last year there was a scandal at the Ministry of Finance. Do 
you personally intend to follow up on the outcome of this 
scandal? 
  [Conte] You are referring to the CFA franc. You are asking 
whether it is good or bad to be outside the franc zone. I think 
you should ask the ordinary Guinean in the street what he thinks 
of it. I personally do not find any (?inconvenience) in being 
outside the zone. If the people ask us [words indistinct]. 
  Concerning probity in the management of public property, I 
believe we are going to continue to ensure that but I believe it 
is not management itself that needs moral probity. It is the 
people in charge of management who need it. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Thousands of people have been trooping into 
Buchanan, Grand Bassa County, over the last couple of days to 
escape the fighting between the NPFL [National Patriotic Front 
of Liberia] and an armed group calling itself the Liberian Peace 
Council. Our reporter, Hassan Kia, who just returned from 
Buchanan, said he saw hundreds of returnees and escapees 
including women with their malnourished babies on their backs. 
Our reporter said most of those who spoke to him looked weary 
and hungry because of the many days of walking in the bushes to 
get to Buchanan from [name indistinct] and its surrounding 
villages. They told our reporter that for nights, they came 
under heavy firing from the two warring sides. 
  Meanwhile, the Catholic Relief Service [CRS] has begun 
distributing emergency food ration to both the returnees and the 
escapees that are arriving in Buchanan and nearby towns. The 
employee of CRS catering for the influx said since yesterday, 
100 bags of rice, vegetable oil, and beans have been 
distributed. Each family, he said, received 20 cups of rice for 
new arrival ration, while efforts were being made to absorb them 
into other areas for regular relief supplies.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Conditions in Liberia's Lofa County appear to have 
deteriorated seriously in the two months since the international 
aid agencies decided to pull out of the area. At the time of 
their withdrawal in December, the finger was pointed at ULIMO 
[United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] for the 
looting of the main UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] 
base in Lofa. The agencies had been looking after tens of 
thousands of Sierra Leonean refugees as well as displaced 
Liberians, and although they finally went back last week, it 
looks as if they are going to have their work cut out, dealing 
with the problem of malnutrition. Our correspondent, Nii 
Anartey Allison, is in the Lofa town of Koilahun. He telexed us 
this report. 
  Scores of children are said to be dying every week in this 
town. The Koilahun Hospital, the only health center, is without 
medical supplies and doctors serving there left when the aid 
agencies withdrew last December. Joseph Sipo, the administrator 
of the Koilahun Hospital, told me yesterday that kwashiorkor was 
widespread among children, and he had seen about 20 cases of 
measles in the last week. The most painful incidents, he said, 
were the deaths two weeks ago of three pregnant women, who would 
have been saved if they had been operated on. During my stay in 
Koilahun with the UNHCR chief of mission, residents in Koilahun 
said they are barely surviving on roots. Old man Maridorba told 
me: If the relief people do not help us, we will all die. 
  In another development, the ULIMO battalion commander 
accused 
of masterminding the assault of the UNHCR base camp in Vahun 
last December, said yesterday that officers at ULIMO 
headquarters in Tubmanburg ordered the raid on the base camp 
without his knowledge. Ousmane Kone, better known as Colonel 
Pepper and Salt, said: They are putting the blame on me for 
what they did. He explained that at the time the UNHCR base 
camp was raided, he was busy commanding the boys in the war 
against the Lorma Defense Force in Upper Lofa. Pepper and Salt 
is seen in ULIMO circles as the most feared of the commanders, 
often accused of killing people at will, but he hit back 
yesterday, accusing the ULIMO headquarters in Tubmanburg of 
harboring murderous commanders.

  [Text] The Party for Democracy and Progress [PDP] decided 
to withdraw from government yesterday afternoon. Among other 
things, the party disapproves of the Alliance for Democracy in 
Mali's attitude regarding the underlying principles of the 
Republican pact, as well as the management of public affairs. 
The party's decision follows the cabinet reshuffle, which 
confirmed the withdrawal of the National Committee for 
Democratic Initiative and the Rally for Democracy and Progress 
from the government. The PDP representative within the cabinet 
was Boubakar Karamoko Coulibaly at the Ministry of Youth and 
Sports.

  [Text] Lagos, 7 Feb (AFP) -- Beko Ransome-Kuti has been 
re-elected national chairman of Nigeria's pro-democracy Campaign 
for Democracy (CD) umbrella group despite criticism from within 
the leadership, participants in the election said Monday. 
Ransome-Kuti was reelected at a convention on Sunday in Ibadan, 
some 140 kilometres (85 miles) north of Lagos. 
  A group within the CD, led by Chima Ubani, the former CD 
secretary-general, last month accused Dr. Ransome-Kuti of 
"collaborating" with the regime of military ruler General Sani 
Abacha, thereby "compromising" the association. Ransome-Kuti 
has denied the charges. 
  An attempt by the dissenters to pass a vote of no confidence 
in Ransome-Kuti's leadership was defeated by majority of 
participants, sparking a walkout by a number of prominent 
opponents of Ransome-Kuti before the leadership vote, conference 
sources said. Some activists said they would not rule out the 
formation of another human rights group by the opponents of 
Ransome-Kuti's leadership.

  [Text] Lome, 7 Feb (PANA) -- Provisional results from 11 
out of the 81 electoral constituencies in Sunday's [6 February] 
legislative elections in Togo indicated that the Togolese 
People's Assembly (RPT) of Gen. Gnassingbe Eyadema had obtained 
six seats in the first ballot to only one by the opposition. 
  According to the results announced at 1500 GMT Monday by the 
chairman of the National Electoral Commission, Sipohon Gaba the 
RPT was also well positioned in four other constituencies. 
  The chairman of the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), Edem 
Kodjo, scored a first round victory in his constituency of Lome. 
He obtained 65.32 of the ballots cast. 
  Sources close to the electoral commission at noon had 
indicated that the RPT obtained 32 seats in the first round. 
However, the Coordination of New Forces of Prime Minister 
Joseph Kokou Koffigoh has fared badly.

  [Excerpts] The counting of votes of yesterday's legislative 
elections continues under the supervision of the National 
Electoral Commission [CEN], which made public the first 
provisional results this afternoon. According to these first 
results from 11 constituencies, the Togolese People's Rally is 
leading with six seats, followed closely by the Action Committee 
for Renewal and the Togolese Union for Democracy, which will go 
to the second round of elections in several constituencies. 
[passage omitted] 
  According to the electoral code, the complete results of the 
first round of elections must be communicated to the Supreme 
Court by the evening of 9 February so that they can be 
announced. In an evening radio and television program on the 
elections at the Palais des Congres yesterday, CEN Chairman Kue 
Sipohon Gaba admitted the slowness with which the votes are 
being counted. This slowness is due to lack of sufficient means 
to count the votes. According to the general opinion, voting 
took place in satisfactory conditions. Opposition candidates 
and those from the presidential group unanimously admitted this, 
although they pointed out certain shortcomings in the 
organization.

<F P=106> [News release issued by the Government of the Republic of </F>
Angola in Luanda on 7 February--read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Government of the Republic of Angola regrets 
having to inform the Angolan and international public about the 
resumption of offensive actions by National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] troops throughout the country, 
particularly their direct aggression on the martyred city of 
Cuito, the capital of Bie Province, on 5 February 1994. These 
criminal actions fit within the framework of the campaign woven 
by Jonas Savimbi's organizations to undermine peace efforts made 
by the Angolan Government and the international community in 
Lusaka. Accordingly, UNITA seeks to protract the suffering of 
the Angolan people unnecessarily, and to worsen the tragic 
situation faced by the residents of Bie Province, who are once 
again deprived of international humanitarian assistance. It is 
significant to note that whenever alleged progress is reported 
at the peace talks, UNITA invents (?attempts), reports military 
offensives that have not taken place, and, as is the case now, 
resorts to the force of arms to gain new positions on the battle 
front. 
  The Government of the Republic of Angola urges all the 
Angolan people to be vigilant against UNITA's maneuvers, and 
expects the international community, particularly the United 
Nations to keep up their diplomatic pressure, including 
sanctions against that organization to make it desist of its 
warmongering stance, and to make it to negotiate a just and 
lasting peace within the spirit of national reconciliation. 
  The military adventure that has been undertaken will have no 
effect at the negotiating table. The Angolan Government will 
not give in to absurd demands that UNITA might make in 
contravention of the constitutional and democratic order that 
has been established in the country since the September 1992 
elections. 
  The Government of the Republic of Angola remains committed 
to 
gaining peace through negotiations, and to searching for ways to 
resume humanitarian assistance to Cuito. Yet, it cannot remain 
indifferent to yet another offensive or else it would put at 
stake the survival of the affected residents and the protection 
of state institutions.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good evening. There has been no progress at the 
negotiations this afternoon. The mediators and observers met 
with Jorge Valentim, but it produced nothing. It has been 
reported that, so far, UNITA has not reacted to the document 
issued by the mediators and observers entitled General 
Principles on National Reconciliation. Most of UNITA's 
negotiating team is still in Cote d'Ivoire. Only Jorge Valentim 
is in Lusaka. UN Special Representative Blondin Beye is also in 
Cote d'Ivoire and might return on 9 February. 
  This morning the government team met with the mediators and 
observers. According to a source, the meeting reviewed the 
document issued by the mediators and observers in what could be 
described as the government's first reaction. The source says 
that, in general, the government agrees with the views of the 
mediators and observers and has not proposed major changes to 
the document. 
  A number of questions still need to be addressed -- namely, 
when will the UNITA negotiating team return and what will the 
working agenda in Lusaka be tomorrow? Analysts say it is 
unlikely that the talks will be productive while Beye and 
UNITA's negotiating team are absent.

  [Text] General Lelio Goncalves, commander of the UN forces 
in Mozambique, says the Mozambican peace process is heading in 
the right direction. Speaking to the Portuguese news agency, 
LUSA, Goncalves said: The two sides are cooperating and trying 
to ensure the continuity of the process. On 13 February, Gen. 
Goncalves, a Brazilian, ends his 12-month contract with the 
United Nations. He noted that he would only request an 
extension of his mandate if there were a crisis in the 
Mozambican peace process. He said the Mozambican process 
differs a great deal from the Angolan. Goncalves said 
Mozambicans are anxious about peace, the former warring factions 
no longer receive foreign assistance, UN troops are in place, 
and the Mozambique National Resistance is not the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola.

  [Excerpts] Fifty officers of the future Mozambique Defense 
Armed Forces [FADM] today began a command and management 
training course. Ceremonial speeches were expected to be 
delivered on the occasion, but Mozambique National Resistance's 
[Renamo] Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo caused a stir. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Begin Ngonhamo recording] I would like to repeat that this 
is a nonpartisan army. Its officers can never make political 
decisions, because the politicians are the right people for 
that. Your decisive role is to defend the country from any 
possible threat or aggression. Our country is threatened from 
all corners. All neighboring countries pose a threat to 
Mozambique. Likewise, there are some Mozambicans who are still 
guided by the spirit of revenge and violence. Some of them are 
hiding arms; others are secretly training forces. You, however, 
have bet on peace, not violence. There is no reason for alarm. 
  I would like to answer a question posed by two officers. My 
answer will be for all of you. They asked me what was the 
mission of the troops undergoing training. For your 
information, Mr. Nihia, the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo] Party secretary for Nampula, is the leader of a 
1,000-man group that has been secretly trained in Nampula. The 
United Nations is aware of it. The United Nations has been 
informed and tried to investigate the case in the field, but was 
prevented from going there. 
  My question is: Who will those troops attack? They will not 
attack Renamo, Frelimo, the Mozambique United Front-Democratic 
Convergence Party, the National Convention Party or any other 
party. They are supposed to attack the FADM. [end recording] 
[passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, General Eduardo da Silva Nihia has reacted to 
Gen. 
Mateus Ngonhamo's accusations. This afternoon, Nihia rebutted 
the accusations, saying his mission in the province is to 
educate Frelimo members and sympathizers as well the residents 
in general on how to take part in the multiparty elections 
scheduled for October 1994. He demanded that Gen. Ngonhamo 
produce evidence about his alleged involvement in the training 
of the 1,000 men and the hiding of arms. 
  [Begin Nihia recording] I do not know where Gen. Ngonhamo 
got 
his facts. He must produce evidence. He must say that arms are 
hidden in such and such a place and Nihia is responsible, and 
that men are being trained in such and such a place and that 
Nihia is responsible. The truth is that, right now, I know 
nothing about it. My task has to do with the Frelimo Party. 
Gen. Ngonhamo will have to produce facts, places, and districts 
in Nampula Province. The war is over, and our party believes 
that. [end recording] 
  We asked Nihia to comment on Renamo's accusations leveled 
against him. 
  [Begin Nihia recording] My reading of the situation is that, 
in Nampula Province, Renamo is desperate. Renamo has been 
unable to consolidate its position here. The residents have 
rejected Renamo. 
  You will recall that in November 1992, Renamo claimed that 
it 
had a strong following among Nampula Province residents. Now, 
the situation is different. When they come here they talk about 
me precisely because I am charge of this province politically. 
I feel Renamo does that because they realize they have no room 
for maneuver here. 
  Pensado [Renamo's representative for Nampula Province] is 
always insulting people. That is his policy. We do not wish to 
argue on the basis of insults. That is to go too low. He 
insults me, [Nampula Province Governor] Gamito, and other 
people. He has no grounds for such insults. So, I think Renamo 
is desperate. [end recording]

since the signing of the Rome accord in October 1992. This was 
disclosed to our correspondent today by (Nana Quy), regional 
coordinator of the Norwegian Refugee Council. She said the 
refugees returned from Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa, 
and Swaziland. The returnees received agricultural equipment and 
seeds, and were helped to resettle in their home areas. She 
added that in 1994 returnees will continue to be registered at 
civilian institutions [words indistinct] and educational 
programs. A total of $3.5 million could be allocated for the 
execution of those programs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ya-qub Sibindy, president of the Mozambique </F>
Independent Party, Pimo, by Domingos Alberto; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Alberto] The Mozambique Independent Party, Pimo, 
was founded on 23 March 1993 and presented itself to the public 
in August 1993. Mr. President, in general terms, could you 
describe Pimo and what are its political and philosophical 
foundations? 
  [Sibindy] Pimo is an emergent political force based on 
democratic principles. It guarantees an ample participation and 
its members can freely and critically express their diverse 
opinions. It is an independent political party because it does 
not accept influence from any other party, the state, 
government, any social or professional organization, or any 
philosophical association. 
  Pimo believes that the pursuance of its goals will allow us 
to identify the behavior and characteristics of the various 
social stratum in our country. To that end, our party has a 
research office whose task it is to to carry out studies, 
survey, identify problems, carry out inquiries, and listen to 
people. 
  It is on this basis that Pimo believes the fatherland can be 
rebuilt from the devastating 16-year war. To that end, our 
party relies on three watchwords: peace, moral values, and 
progress. Pimo believes that the process of research, as well as 
the identification of the behavior and characteristics of each 
section of society, must not ignore the aforementioned 
watchwords. On the basis of those findings, Pimo wants to 
obtain the natural concept of the definition of man, taking into 
account the diversity factor. 
  This is how Pimo believes it can achieve its desired goal of 
serving all people. Pimo believes this is the only way to 
respond to the concerns and needs of all sections of society, on 
the basis of consensus. Pimo also defends the preservation of 
the cultural values of the various ethnic and social groups that 
make up the Mozambican people. It believes that reconciliation 
and harmony are the solutions to political differences. It 
seeks general well- being, social justice, and a pluralist 
democracy. Pimo believes in a legal state where universal human 
rights principles are respected. 
  [Alberto] It is said that Mozambican citizens of Islamic 
origin and "well off" people make up the majority of your 
party's mambership. Is that unintended or planned? 
  [Sibindy] I think it is unintended because, when the party 
was formed, it was not our intention to make our politics on the 
basis of religion. It is quite possible that there are muslims 
or christians within Pimo, but its guidelines include nothing 
definite concerning the use of religious "slogans" [preceding 
word in English]. 
  [Alberto] One of the great revelations made during your 
party's constitutional conference was that you would be a 
candidate in the presidential elections, when the first 
multiparty elections are held. Do you think you might win? 
  [Sibindy] I would perhaps like to correct your question 
before giving you an answer. When the party held its 
constitutional conference, there was no point on our agenda 
pertaining to presidential candidacies. We dealt with 
everything except what you are saying. To answer your question, 
replacing presidential with legislative elections, I must tell 
you that Pimo believes it will participate in the legislative 
elections and that it will do well. 
  [Alberto] Seeing that we are discussing this matter, would 
you care to advance your predictions concerning the presidential 
elections? 
  [Sibindy] Pimo's answer is the same, concerning the 
presidential elections. It is interested in competing in the 
presidential elections, but it is up to party structures to 
decide who will be candidate. 
  [Alberto] What is your party doing to achieve that much 
desired goal? 
  [Sibindy] Being a journalist, you will know that Pimo has 
not 
been much in the press and that we have not talked about our 
moves. On the contrary, the first time we appeared in the press 
was on MEDIAFAX. Pimo has not wanted to appear in the press for 
the simple reason that it believes politics is not made by 
constantly doing so but, rather, by working with the grass 
roots, directly with the citizens. For instance, Pimo has 
branches operating in just about all provinces and districts of 
the country and it now wants to expand into the smaller areas. 
Pimo prefers to go about its work quietly so it can reap its 
fruits -- that it, to increase its membership. To give you an 
example, we work quietly and then we make a public announcement 
when we feel we have attained the goals we had sought. Our 
party's constitutional conference was proof of that. I toured 
northern Mozambique to do work with the grass roots and I found 
that the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] are dominant. However, 
when an unarmed opposition party comes along to do political 
work with the people, it is prevented by Renamo militants in 
government-administered areas. Just to give you an example, we 
were surprised when we were stoned by Renamo supporters or 
sympathizers. How can people say they have fought for democracy 
when they break democratic norms just as the results of their 
struggle begin to emerge? Difficulties in gaining access to 
Renamo or government-controlled areas in Angoche and Nacala 
confirm that Renamo is hostile. I can even add that we would 
have been shot at, had we insisted on forcibly entering those 
areas.... 
  [Alberto] Given the situation the country is in, what would 
you do were you to win the country's first free and democratic 
elections? 
  [Sibindy] Pimo believes that it should strengthen the 
country's pacification process. The government should not be 
made up of Pimo members alone, just because Pimo won the 
elections. There is the need to pacify all political forces in 
this country so that both those who have weapons and those who 
do not have them feel responsibile for being part of the new 
government. Pimo has a research office that talks to workers, 
Mozambican businessmen, religious figures, traditional chiefs, 
other traditional figures, people of other perceptions, and 
civilian society at large to obtain their opinions regarding 
what they would like to see in certain areas. Pimo would like 
to institute a unitary state where there is decentralization and 
a separation of powers. Governors and administrators must be 
appointed locally. Resources must be used, taking into account 
the development of each area, after consulting with the people. 
  To Pimo, moral values are one of the most important of its 
watchwords. It is a priority that people recover their moral 
values. The individual's participation in society has to do 
with that individual's moral values. That is an indispensable 
element to add to the qualities a human being should possess. 
The regime instituted by the ruling party has been the catalyst 
of the destruction of Mozambican society's moral values, thereby 
disrupting the social fabric. Many of the irregularities 
reported today arise from a lack of moral values in all areas. 
  With regard to progress, Pimo believes that the Mozambican 
man is central to this country's development. Within this 
framework, Pimo also intends to implement plans concerning work 
to integrate citizens through the relevant religious and other 
civilian institutions. So, Pimo's links with religion aim at an 
effective implementation of its programs. Within an economic 
context, Pimo intends to open the necessary space for 
competition to occur, thereby stimulating development. Pimo 
supports privatization, the creation of joint enterprises, and a 
fiscal policy that will serve the interests of national 
businessmen. 
  [Alberto] In addition to what you have just said, does Pimo 
have other projects and, if so, in what areas? 
  [Sibindy] The Pimo leadership has devised and drawn up many 
plans. In the area of construction, Pimo plans to erect a 
10-story building where its premises are at this stage. That is 
to store all the party's bureaucratic machinery at the national 
level. Some of the flats will be used to provide accommodation 
for members coming from the provinces. In the transportation 
sector, Pimo defends the creation of collective transportation 
companies to minimize the shortages we see today.... 
  [Alberto] For instance, do you not have plans for the 
agricultural sector? After all, the 16-year war did much to 
devastate that sector and needs urgent rehabilitation because 
agriculture is the basis for development in a country such as 
ours, which is not producing enough at this point. 
  [Sibindy] Pimo has a program for the agricultural sector 
but, 
as I have said, I do not think it is opportune to talk about 
that because work is under way to consult with various sections 
of civilian society so we get an idea about what they would like 
our agricultural policy to be. 
  [Alberto] What backing does Pimo have to implement those 
plans? 
  [Sibindy] In addition to contributions by its members and 
the 
funds made available to the political parties by the government, 
Pimo enjoys the support of the Mozambican and international 
communities to implement those plans. 
  [Alberto] What social and economic system would Pimo 
envisage 
for this country? 
  [Sibindy] Pimo defends a free market economy where the state 
only has the role of controller. The state's intervention must 
not be negative. It must let people work as they please, on the 
basis of mutual trust, because for a person to become a 
businessman he must be worthy of some trust. There must also be 
a clear fiscal policy that will not contravene existing norms. 
  [Alberto] What is Pimo's ideological line and what type of 
state does it stand for? 
  [Sibindy] Ideologically, Pimo pursues a social democratic 
line. It supports a unitary state with decentralized and 
separate powers. It is important to note here that provinces and 
districts must be given the right to decide on certain local 
matters. For instance, if a district has the means to build a 
health post, it should do so without having to wait for the red 
tape of provincial or national structures. 
  [Alberto] When you talk about decentralization, are you 
thinking about possible federalism? 
  [Sibindy] Well, I am not talking about federalism. As I have 
pointed out earlier, I am talking about a unitary state. I am 
talking about decentralizing powers. Autonomy is not in 
territorial terms in previously established areas. In doing so, 
Pimo wants to avoid bureaucracy and give responsibilities to the 
people of each given area. They must take the initiative into 
their own hands, instead of waiting for decisions to be made for 
them by the central authorities. 
  [Alberto] Is it in Pimo's plans to accept coalition with 
other political parties? 
  [Sibindy] Pimo will agree to coalition with other parties to 
safeguard peace and to strengthen reconciliation. Pimo can form 
a coalition on the basis of equal treatment and will open the 
possibility of debate to see to what extent the idea can be 
implemented. 
  [Alberto] What do you think about the process of confining 
soldiers that began recently? 
  [Sibindy] Pimo believes the people who are being confined 
are 
human beings, so the United Nations must do its best to provide 
them reasonable logistical cond?tions. 
  [Alberto] What do you think about this process. at least up 
to this stage? 
  [Sibindy] I believe the process is running smoothly. The 
steps being taken are encouraging, and with some arrangements 
the expected results could be achieved. 
  [Alberto] What system among parliamentary, 
semipresidentialist, and presidentialist democracies would you 
like to see implemented after the elections? 
  [Sibindy] Pimo would prefer a parliamentary democracy. 
  [Alberto] Why? 
  [Sibindy] Because that system confers strong powers on 
parliament. In that system the government is appointed by 
parliament, and it is answerable to parliament. There are 
constitutional and administrative courts, which are independent 
organs that intervene on any problem that may emerge. 
  [Alberto] What do you think about reports that the Malawian 
"Young Pioneers" entered Mozambican territory, and what 
implications may that have for our country? 
  [Sibindy] If it is true that the Malawi youths are among us, 
it is an issue that the government has undertaken to solve in 
good faith, and I must say that I encourage the government to 
continue working on it using all diplomatic and peaceful means 
until the problem is solved. This problem threatens peace at a 
time when we are doing away with the war machine. No one wants 
a foreign armed force violating our border. Pimo believes the 
government is in a transitional stage and no one is interested 
in conflicts. It appeals to the Malawian Government to be 
understanding and to cooperate with the Mozambican Government. 
  [Alberto] What is your comment on the controversy that 
emerged in the election of the three members who will represent 
the unarmed opposition in the National Elections Commission? 
  [Sibindy] I believe Dr. Jose Mayopue's case is unique. I 
should simply congratulate the unarmed opposition for the 
position it took. If he feels he is still obligated to the 
Frelimo and wants to serve it, he cannot possibly render 
services to other parties. If he left Frelimo, then his case may 
be an exception. In this case he is the one to choose. We of 
the opposition should ask Dr. Jose Mayopue what he prefers. 
  [Alberto] Imagine that your party wins elections: Do you 
already have plans for a foreign policy? 
  [Sibindy] Pimo intends to maintain good diplomatic relations 
with all countries of the world, giving priority to the 
development of cooperation among peoples, promotion of the 
defense and territorial integrity of the country, and peaceful 
coexistence without interference in domestic affairs of other 
countries, with reciprocal benefits, equality, friendship, 
solidarity, and cooperation among peoples. 
  Pimo also intends to have foreign relations that result in 
mutual benefits. Pimo does not agree with relations based on 
"priorities." In 1977 Frelimo diverted from its aims, surprising 
its militants with the announcement that it was a 
Marxist-Leninist oriented party. I believe this decision was 
made due to reasons of military cooperation, the supply of 
weapons, and as a reward for favors. Obviously, the model had to 
be imposed. Pimo hopes that what happened with Frelimo will not 
happen with the Renamo; otherwise, we shall have to pay in kind 
in the years to come for the military undertakings. 
  Pimo is independent because it has not made this kind of 
undertaking, and when it approaches the international community 
in line with its foreign policy, it will do so freely without 
influences such as I have just mentioned. That is why Pimo 
fears for the victory of one the former warring factions and 
appeals to the opposition to unite as an independent party. 
  [Alberto] You have previously stated that you had served 
another party. I would like to know what you think about being 
a politician. 
  [Sibindy] It is difficult to be a politician, if one's 
movement is formed under pressure or guided by foreign interests 
or influences. That is difficult. Pimo favors the formation of 
a force or political movement that does not depend on external 
political influence. Even if it is an armed movement, the 
criteria has to be the same. We should not satisfy the 
interests of outside blocs in the name of national interests. 
We believe that a nationalist is the one who, of his free will, 
strives to serve the nation. Politics is easy if one follows 
that pattern. It is more difficult to be a politician when 
there is a tendency to serve foreign interests. 
  [Alberto] Is this why you left the party you belonged to 
join 
the one that emerged recently? 
  [Sibindy] Yes, that is the reason. Otherwise I would still 
belong to Frelimo. As soon as I realized that Frelimo was 
identifying with interests that did not correspond to 
Mozambique's, I realized that it was no longer a party whose aim 
was to serve the people. It was then that I began thinking of 
leaving it.

  [Text] The Secretary General of the ruling MPLA [Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola] party in Angola, Lopo do 
Nascimento, is in Namibia to discuss business-related issues 
with his SWAPO [South-West African People's Organization] 
counterpart Moses Garoeb. Garoeb told NBC [Namibian 
Broadcasting Corporation] news that the visit is a strictly 
party-to-party business mission, although political issues will 
also be discussed. He said both the MPLA and SWAPO have 
business interests which are supposed to help them become 
independent and self-reliant within the multiparty political 
environment. Garoeb revealed that some of the business 
interests to be discussed between the two parties will include 
fisheries and transportation.

  [Text] South Africa and Zimbabwe have laid the foundations 
for the first major cooperation agreement between the two 
countries in 14 years. The minister of justice and of defense, 
Mr. Kobie Coetsee, and his Zimbabwean counterparts, Mr. Emmerson 
Mnangagwa and Mr. Dumiso Dabengwa [name as heard], said after 
talks in Harare that a working committee had been established to 
oversee an exchange of information on matters such as the 
administration of justice, the combating of organized crime, and 
the resumption of an extradition treaty. The imprisonment in 
Zimbabwe of three South Africa agents had also been discussed, 
but Mr. Mnangagwa merely said that the men would be freed at an 
appropriate time. The men were sentenced to life imprisonment 
for bombing an ANC [African National Congress] house in 1988.

  [Text] Harare Feb 8 SAPA -- Exiled former Ethiopian 
dictator Col Mengistu Haile Mariam is to be told on Tuesday [8 
February] that if he continues to launch political attacks 
against the present government of Ethiopia, he will have to 
leave Zimbabwe. 
  THE HERALD, Zimbabwe's main daily newspaper, on Tuesday 
morning quoted senior Zimbabwe Government sources as saying that 
Mengistu, who was granted political asylum in Zimbabwe nearly 
four years ago, was to meet personally at 2PM Tuesday with none 
less than Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira to be told to 
"shut up or get out". 
  The angry reaction against the man once seen as one of 
President Robert Mugabe's closest friends follows a long, 
rambling letter by Mengistu published in Harare at the weekend 
in which he claims to have been called by his countrymen to 
"rescue my country" from the government of President Meles 
Zenawi. 
  A Zimbabwean Government spokesman on Monday night sharply 
attacked Mengistu, dubbed "the butcher of Addis Ababa" for 
alleged massacres of thousands of people. Information Director 
Bornwell Chakaodza said Mengistu's statement was "regrettable" 
and that it threatened to undo the rapport between Zimbabwe and 
Ethiopia. 
  THE HERALD, widely regarded as a government mouthpiece, said 
Mr Shamuyarira would express the government's "extreme 
displeasure" to Mengistu over what was a serious breach of his 
conditions of asylum, which were that he would be allowed to 
live here privately with his family but was forbidden to engage 
in any political activity. 
  The newspaper spoke of high-level meetings at the Ministry 
of 
Foreign Affairs on Monday, where Mengistu's statement was 
discussed with indignation by officials. It said Mengistu would 
be told "in no uncertain terms" that Zimbabwe respected the 
wishes of the Ethiopian people in electing President Zenawi. Mr 
Mugabe and Mr Zenawi had met twice and relations between the two 
countries were now "cordial". 
  As rebel forces of Zenawi's Ethiopian People's Revolutionary 
Democratic Front (EPRDF) converged on Addis Ababa in May 1990, 
Mengistu fled his country. His departure followed 13 years as 
head of one of the bloodiest regimes in recent African history, 
which imposed Stalinist policies that wrecked the thriving 
economy under former Emperor Haile Selassie. 
  He landed in Harare and was granted asylum by Mr Mugabe, a 
favour that has repeatedly embarrassed the Zimbabwe premier, as 
human rights groups condemned him for giving refuge to a man 
regarded as a mass murderer, who should be sent home to face 
trial. 
  Over the years Mengistu has become a lonely man, a virtual 
prisoner in his government villa in a diplomatic suburb of 
Harare, deserted first by his wife, Werb Anchi, and then his 
bodyguards.

  [Text] The Transitional Executive Council's [TEC] decision 
to retain detention without trial has been condemned by the 
General Council of the Bar, which described it as wholly 
unacceptable in a free society. Council Chairman (Vin 
Trengrove) said in Johannesburg that any decision to retain 
detention without trial would also fly in the face of the 
constitutional principles recently endorsed by the multiparty 
negotiating process and by the TEC itself. Mr. (Trengrove) 
called on the TEC to reaffirm its commitment to the repeal of 
Section 29 of the Internal Security Act, which provides for 
detention without trial.

  [Text] Durban Feb 7 SAPA -- KwaZulu Police [KZP] 
commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During will appear before the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] on Tuesday [8 February] to 
supply information about alleged KZP hit squads, his lawyer 
confirmed on Monday. In an out-of-court settlement on Friday, 
it was decided Gen During would appear before the TEC in 
Pretoria on Tuesday afternoon. This averted Monday's planned 
TEC application for a Supreme Court order compelling Gen During 
to appear before the council, said the KZP commissioner's legal 
representative Patrick Falconer. 
  Acting on the instruction's of kwaZulu Chief Minister and 
Police Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Gen During has until now 
refused to appear before the TEC. Mr Buthelezi and the kwaZulu 
government refuse to recognise the TEC's authority. 
  In a statement on Monday, Mr Buthelezi said media reports 
stating his government had capitulated to the TEC were a 
"blatant misrepresentation of the facts". 
  "Neither I nor my administration have deviated one iota from 
our rejection of the TEC which we regard as an undemocratic and 
politically biased structure which is embarking on a campaign 
against their political rivals." 
  He said he had accepted the settlement based on the fact 
that 
SA Police [SAP] Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe had the 
authority to instruct Lt-Gen During as a seconded member of the 
SAP to appear before the TEC. "In my capacity as minister of 
the KZP I would not obstruct such a request by the commissioner 
of the SAP," said Mr Buthelezi. 
  "Secondly, I point out that the settlement was also based on 
a withdrawal of the (Supreme Court) action by the TEC with each 
party bearing its own legal costs. This is hardly indicative of 
a successful suit by the TEC." 
  Earlier, Mr Falconer explained that in terms of Friday's 
settlement, Gen During would appear before the TEC in his 
"private capacity" and not as KZP commissioner. In this way the 
kwaZulu government would not appear to be officially recognising 
the TEC. 
  However, TEC Co-Chairman Zam Titus responded on Monday that 
"as far as I'm aware, that is not the situation". He could not 
comment further as the issue would be discussed at a meeting 
later on Monday. The meeting had not been concluded by early 
Monday evening. 
  Gen During's expected appearance before the TEC follows a 
Goldstone Commission report last year on the existence of at 
least one KZP hit squad allegedly responsible for several 
murders in Natal. Five suspects -- allegedly linked to some of 
the murders -- have appeared in court in Mtunzini, near 
Empangeni, and will appear again next month.

  [Text] East London Feb 7 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] evaded suggestions on Monday [7 February] that a 
prominent candidate on its election list, Transkei's military 
ruler Major-General Bantu Holomisa, was flouting the 
organisation's policy on detention without trial. 
  Nzuzo Matiwane, suspected of involvement in the SADF [South 
African Defense Force] raid on an Umtata home in which five 
youths were killed, has been held in detention under Section 47 
of the homeland's Public Security Act for the past four months. 
Lawyers for Human Rights have tried unsuccessfully to free him 
and are now working on alternative ways of challenging his 
detention. 
  Approached for comment on Monday, ANC spokesman Ronnie 
Mamoepa said the organisation remained steadfast in its 
opposition to detention without trial. "The position of the ANC 
has always been that any person who has been detained as a 
suspect should be brought before a court of law as speedily as 
possible," Mr Mamoepa said. 
  He repeated this statement six or seven times when asked 
whether Gen Holomisa, who is 13th on the ANC's national election 
list, was not causing embarrassment to the organisation. 
  He maintained that the Transkei police and not the homeland 
leader was responsible for Mr Matiwane's arrest and continued 
detention. 
  Asked whether the ANC planned to approach Gen Holomisa to 
discuss the situation he said: "As far as I know we don't have 
any plans to intervene in the matter." 
  In an interview earlier, Gen Holomisa questioned how he 
could 
be considered an embarrassment to the ANC when the organisation, 
as a member of the Transitional Executive Council, had agreed to 
postpone the abolition of the detention without trial clause. 
  He blamed South African "agents provocateurs" for the 
continued existence of Section 47 on Transkei's statute books. 
"We were about to remove the act in 1990 but after the 
attempted coup we had to stall the process. Anyway, that law 
has only been used against South African agents provocateurs. 
"We are in the process of removing all other related laws but we 
can only take a final decision on Section 47 after we have 
completed a threat analysis," he said. 
  While the multiparty talks decided that all laws which 
inhibited personal freedom should be scrapped, Gen Holomisa said 
he feared South Africa might continue to destabilise Transkei in 
the run-up to the election.

  [Text] Umtata Feb 7 SAPA--South Africa needed to send an 
SOS to its international allies and arrange an overseas force to 
keep the peace in the country, Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa, 
Transkei's military ruler, said on Monday [7 February]. 
  Reacting to reported remarks by the National Peacekeeping 
Force [NPKF] commanding officer, Brig Gabriel Ramushwana, that 
the NPKF would not be ready for deployment before and during the 
April general elections, Gen Holomisa said: "South African 
political leaders have no other option but to approach African, 
Asian or Western powers for the assembling of a force to keep 
peace in South Africa or approach the United Nations Security 
Council for the deployment of a UN peace keeping force in the 
country while we are still training and sorting out the current 
problems of the National Peacekeeping Force." 
  He added: "We need to send an SOS call to our friends 
outside South Africa. If we need their capital for investment 
and related assistance, I see no reason why we cannot have 
confidence in them when it comes to security matters. What is 
needed is to agree on the rules and regulations as to how they 
will be involved. The Namibian and Zimbabwean transitional 
arrangements can be used as a model." 
  The general added it was clear the South African Government 
had no interest in seeing the NPKF take off. A total of 10,000 
soliders for the force was the target "but the RSA [Republic of 
South Africa] government saw to it that a mere 3,700 were being 
trained for the purpose. This low number cannot even cordon off 
Soweto when violence flares up."

were arrested on Monday [7 February] in connection with the 
six-week sabotage campaign targeting African National Congress 
[ANC] and trade union offices, railways and electricity pylons 
in the Orange Free State and Western Transvaal. [passage omitted] 
  ANC President Nelson Mandela on Monday welcomed the arrests, 
expressing the hope that police investigations would be thorough 
and the perpetrators brought to justice. "Such action, if 
properly pursued, can only serve the process of restoring the 
image of the SA [South African] Police as a force capable of 
impartial and effective action on behalf of all South Africans. 
We can only hope that these arrests signal the beginning of a 
comprehensive strategy designed to bring to justice those 
elements that wish to frustrate non-racialism, peace and 
democracy," he said in a statement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Vuyo Mvoko: "Saintly PAC Woos the `Sinners'"] </F>
  [Text] In another twist following its suspension of the 
armed struggle, the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] is 
clandestinely pursuing election deals with those its used to 
call "surrogates of the regime". 
  The PAC's strange bedfellows, which it hopes will agree to 
stand under its banner, include the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
the National People's Party, Gazankulu's Ximoko [Whip of the 
Nation] Progressive Party, QwaQwa's Dikwankwetla [Strong], 
kwaNdebele's Intando YeSizwe [Will of the Nation], kaNgwane's 
Inyandza [Cluster] National Movement and Ciskei's African 
Democratic Movement. "As we learn from the Bible," said PAC 
national organiser Maxwell Nemadzivhanani, "Jesus Christ did not 
become a sinner by mixing with sinners, but instead upheld and 
moved them to repent. Revolutionaries shouldn't divorce 
themselves from the masses under the guise of maintaining their 
purity." 
  The PAC had previously given the impression that it did not 
want to work with the "regime's puppets", although it was 
revealed last year that a number of Ciskei cabinet ministers 
held dual membership in both the ADM and PAC. 
  Wounds have hardly healed since Brigadier Oupa Gqozo's 
Ciskei 
Defence Force killed 28 people in 1992 as they tried to march on 
Bisho, yet the PAC hopes to take his ADM along on a PAC ticket. 
The Ciskei government's failure to register in time for 
inclusion in the TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] after it 
severed ties with the Freedom Alliance, might just be a bonus to 
the PAC. 
  Ciskei Council a State spokesman Cedric Harrop said the ADM 
would contest the elections either under its own name or as part 
of an alliance. He said no formal meetings had taken place with 
the PAC, but "sentiments expressed by Gqozo in the past 
indicated that he would be prepared to enter into such 
negotiations with the PAC. The only stumbling block could be 
violence." 
  It was not enough for the PAC to place a moratorium on the 
armed struggle, he said; guarantees were also needed. "We are 
convinced the PAC wants an end to violence, but its problem has 
been to commit APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]," he said. 
  The PAC's surprising policy shift follows last week's 
meeting 
between IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the PAC's 
Clarence Makwetu, allegedly brokered by former PAC stalwart and 
now IFP central committee member, Ziba Jiyane. 
  Nemadzivhanani revealed this week that violence and the 
double ballot were not the only issues discussed by the two 
leaders. He said other issues regarding a "necessary common 
strategy" to persuade other influential personalities and 
organisations to work with the PAC were also discussed. 
  Sources in Natal said this week the PAC's regional 
man-and-a-fax office had closed. Joe Mkhwanazi is now said to 
be organising in the rural areas where land is a drawcard, and 
is said to have the blessing of the IFP. 
  Amichand Rajbansi, of the National People's Party, was the 
first party leader to enthuse over meeting the PAC "at the 
earliest possible time", said Nemadzivhanani. Rajbansi said 
that after elections were proclaimed, he would give the PAC six 
days to decide whether it wanted to enter an alliance with his 
party. 
  Nemadzivhanani maintained none of the political parties 
would 
win the elections on the basis of their membership -- over nine 
million South Africans did not belong to a political party. "A 
vote is a vote in an election; there is no reactionary or 
revolutionary vote. The vote of Rajbansi is identical to that of 
Makwetu. Anyone's vote must be used to put a principled 
organisation like the PAC into power," he said.

  [Text] Durban Feb 5 SAPA--Democratic Party [DP] leader Zach 
de Beer on Saturday [5 February] reiterated his plea to the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] to participate in the April 
election, saying that while prospects for this seemed slim, "I 
hope they won't stay out of the process". Speaking at the DP's 
Natal annual congress, Dr. de Beer said: "If the IFP stays out 
(of elections) it benefits their enemies. We want them to take 
their proper part in the process." 
  DP members from Natal's five sub-regions of the party 
gathered at the Durban Exhibition Centre on Saturday for a 
day-long meeting of the party's annual congress. 
  There Dr. de Beer argued the case for federalism in South 
Africa and the need for a double ballot. He said devolution of 
power diminished the chance of tyrannical rule. Voters were 
urged to put their cross next to the party they really believed 
in, he said, because proportional representation meant every 
vote counted. He warned against "tactical voting", saying it 
was not necessary to vote for one party just to keep another out 
of power. 
  Referring to the DP's lacklustre showing in recent opinion 
polls, Dr. de Beer said: "Let's face it, the polls have been 
depressing for the DP, but don't read too much into it though." 
  The DP leader cautioned voters against trusting the African 
National Congress and the National Party [NP], which both had 
the tendency to "hold human rights in contempt". DP Natal 
Chairman and Umhlanga MP Kobus Jordaan echoed this, saying the 
interim constitution had elements of a liberal constitution, but 
was to an extent "shabby" because of private deals struck 
between the ANC and NP. 
  University of Natal academic and DP member on the 
constitutional technical committee, George Devenish, said the 
interim constitution, although imperfect, was a liberal, 
democratic one. Prof Devenish said there was provision for an 
entrenched bill of rights, a human rights commission, and public 
protector, but negatively there was single ballot voting, a lack 
of unequivocal federal definition, and an unqualified 
anti-deflection clause. 
  Various DP speakers were due to discuss numerous 
electioneering and campaigning issues later in the day, and hold 
annual elections for the leadership of the party in Natal. 
Results are expected to be announced later Saturday.

  [Text] The minister of education and training, Mr. Sam de 
Beer, has criticized as racist and dangerous threats of a return 
to the 1976 style pupil unrest unless white educators are 
removed from black schools. Mr. de Beer was reacting to a call 
by the president of the Azanian People's Organization [Azapo], 
Professor Itumeleng Mosala, for the removal of white teachers 
from black towns. Mr. de Beer said that white teachers are 
appointed to black schools only when suitably qualified black 
educators could not be recruited. He said that in the light of 
the distressing matriculation results, Prof. Mosala's statements 
could further jeopardize efforts to normalize schooling.

  [Text] Cape Town Feb 8 SAPA -- The wave of condemnation 
against the Azanian People's Organisation [Azapo] for supporting 
its student wing's campaign to expel white teachers from the 
townships has not abated, with the South African Democratic 
Teachers Union [SADTU] entering the fray, SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported on Tuesday. SADTU 
President Shepherd Mdladlana said in an interview that his 
organisation took the threat seriously because many white 
teachers in the townships were SADTU members. He said that if 
the Azanian Students Movement (Azasm) carried out it's threat 
there would be confrontation, because SADTU members would feel 
compelled to defend their colleagues.

<F P=106> [Report issued by the South African Human Rights Commission </F>
on 7 February on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] The January death toll, while still very high, 
maintained the downward trend since the highpoint of July 1993. 
If the trend continues, violence levels should reach manageable 
proportions by election day. The use of unrest area 
declarations seems to be declining and currently is only in 
operation in the Eastern Cape, where ironically, political 
violence is minimal. The use of detention without trial, on the 
other hand, continues in operation, in spite of the declared 
undertaking to scrap Section 19 of the Internal Security Act, 
which so far has not materialised. No major massacres occurred 
during January. Amongst January victims were 2 commuters, 22 
women, 22 children, 2 white civilians and 17 members of the 
security forces; reports identified 34 ANC [African National 
Congress] supporters and 14 IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
supporters amongst the dead.

  There was a marginal drop in the PWV deathtoll from 158 in 
December to 142 in January. The region was responsible for 45 
percent of countrywide deaths in January, with the East Rand 
sub- region again figuring prominently. The provisional figure 
of 161 deaths in Natal during January, suggests an encouraging 
downward trend from the 228 in December; however it remains to 
be seen if this trend will be confirmed and sustained. Other 
regions accounted for 14 deaths during January or only 4 percent 
of national total. 
  Security force actions resulted in 11 deaths and 51 injuries 
in the course of 46 incidents during January. Attacks on 
security force members resulted in 17 death and 23 injuries in 
the course of 69 incidents. Right wing activity is on the 
increase with 22 incidents reported during January resulting in 
1 death and 3 injuries. Industrial conflict claimed 1 life. A 
low level of taxi conflict &amp; educational conflict did not 
result 
in any loss of life.

  Commuters suffered 2 deaths and 13 injuries in January. 
Women and children figured prominently; death: 22 women and 22 
children (combined 14 percent of all deaths); injuries: 18 women 
and 15 children. Security force members - see above. White 
civilians recorded 2 dead and 3 injured. Political affiliation 
of the victims was reported in about 15 percent of deaths during 
January: ANC [African National Congress] -- 34 killed and 58 
injured; IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] - 14 killed and 7 injured. 
  Although the national deathtoll in political violence is 
still at the high level of around 10 deaths a day on average, 
nevertheless January recorded the sixth successive declining 
month since the explosion of July. If the trend continues, the 
country could be experiencing a controllable level of violence 
by the date of the elections. 
  During January, HRC [Human Rights Commission] recorded 498 
incidents of political which is a little in excess of last 
year's average incident count of 463. 
  The deathtoll in January of 317 is nearly 50 percent down on 
the highpoint of 605 last July., but still very much higher than 
last January's figure of 175. The injury count for January was 
269, a low figure in relation to the deathtoll. 
  No major massacres were reported in January. 
  During January the magisterial district of Hoopstad in the 
OFS [Orange Free State] was deproclaimed as an unrest area. This 
left 14 unrest areas at the end of the month, all of them in the 
Eastern Cape. On 28 January, the Abolition of Restrictions on 
Free Political Activity Act came into effect on the advice of 
the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] but excluding the 
clause abolishing Section 29. Thus detention without trial under 
Section 29 is still in force. 
  During January 57 persons were detained without 
trial,including 39 under Section 29. At month end, 2 persons 
were still being held. 
  During January 4 deaths in police custody were reported. 
  The total of 117 political arrests During January was 
substantially lower than the monthly average for last year. 
  During January another 5 political trials were completed, 
with a further 38 trials ongoing at month end. 
  Only one person was sentenced to death during January. Death 
row now has 326 occupants. 
  A number of incidents during January indicate clearly that 
the Bophuthatswana government has no intention of allowing free 
political activity to take place in the territory.

<F P=106> [Report by Mandy Jean Woods] </F>
  [Excerpt] Almost every financial rand [finrand] application 
made to the Reserve Bank between 1987 and 1988 involving large 
amounts of money -- between R[rand]5 million and R100 million -- 
that has been examined by investigators of the Witwatersrand 
Attorney-General's office appears to be bogus. 
  This emerged in the same week that Reserve Bank Governor 
Chris Stals admitted that about R10 billion in foreign exchange 
reserves had left the country in the second half of last year. 
  Investigators have so far called for the Reserve Bank files 
of 44 companies which made multiple (between one and six) 
applications for finrands during the two-year period in 
question. They have found that in almost every case: 

  -  The application were bogus. 
  -  They related to strategic or labour-intensive industries. 
  -  They had been approved by Reserve Bank management. 
  -  Commercial bank staff -- such as bank managers or staff in 
the 
foreign exchange departments with access to bank systems and 
heaps of money -- had knowingly taken part in the fraud. 
  -  Most large commercial banks are implicated. 
  -  Lawyers who are prepared to "bend the rules" are involved. 

    The value of the fraud currently being investigated tops 
R200 
million and could rise to double this, as the 10-month 
investigation continues. Investigators are working around the 
clock to compile charge sheets for some of the country's top 
businessmen, lawyers and bankers. Arrests in some of the cases 
are expected soon. 
  "If the Reserve Bank, as the guardian of South Africa's 
foreign exchange reserves, is doing the best it can, then at 
best it is being grossly negligent in its duty," remarked Niko 
Shefer this week. Shefer, who was jailed in 1990 for his role 
in a R45 million foreign exchange fraud, is co-operating with 
the Attorney General's office in the investigation. "If the 
investments had happened as purported, South Africa would be 
swimming -- no, drowning -- in money," Shefer said, speaking 
from his work centre in the Attorney- General's office. 
  Stals said it was not possible to identify the scale of 
illegal capital outflows, "otherwise they would have been 
blocked. Such illegal outflows form part of the errors and 
omissions item of the balance of payments". But investigators 
said there were glaring errors in the applications approved by 
the Reserve Bank. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte says nearly a 
million rands in capital is now leaving the country each month 
because of conflicting statements made by the ANC [African 
National Congress] on nationalization. Mr. Schutte told a group 
of Durban businessmen the role of the ANC, as the dominating 
partner in a future government, could also lead to foreign 
investor skepticism. The minister added that, last year alone, 
at least 9 billion rand had left the country.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 7 SAPA -- The country's business 
mood improved cautiously in the December 1993 - January 1994 
period as economic fundamentals continued to improve, the SA 
[South African] Chamber of Business [SACOB] said Monday in 
Johannesburg. SACOB's business confidence index [BCI] improved 
by one percentage point to 104.9 from 103.9 in November last 
year. 
  Releasing the data, chief economist Ben van Rensburg however 
warned that political electioneering before the polls in April 
could result in uncertainty over economic policy and thus harm 
confidence. Electioneering had not helped to bring any clarity 
to economic policy and would increase uncertainty as political 
campaigns intensified. Reconciling populist strategies aimed at 
winning votes with realistic policies which would promote 
business confidence was difficult for many of the political 
players. 
  Dr Van Rensburg said a key measure of this type of 
uncertainty was the capital account which experienced outflows 
of about R[rand]15-billion last year. The index was higher over 
the last two months as a result of an improvement in seven of 
the 13 sub-indices which make up the BCI. 

  -  Stock market prices continued to reach new highs, 
  -  The value of building plans passed climbed markedly, 
  -  Real retail sales were higher on a monthly seasonally 
adjusted 
basis, 
  -  Short-term interest rates edged lower, and 
  -  The gold price firmed on international markets. 

    Negative influences on the BCI included: 

  -  The number of new passenger vehicles sold eased, 
  -  The volume of merchandise imports were lower, 
  -  The exchange rate of the commercial rand against the US 
dollar 
worsened, and 
  -  The official inflation rate increased slightly. 

    Although the economy was definitely in the recovery stage, 
Dr 
Van Rensburg stressed it was vital to achieve a political 
inclusive settlement. This would bolster business and consumer 
confidence leading to an easing in capital outflows as well as 
underpinning the economy. 
  SACOB has forecast a growth rate of between two and 2.5 per 
cent this year following on the economy's contraction over the 
last four years.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], today begins two days of political contacts 
in South Africa, meeting Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi in 
Ulundi. Afonso Dhlakama arrived in South Africa on a private 
visit on 4 February. A source with the Renamo delegation in 
South Africa told the Portuguese news agency, LUSA, that 
Dhlakama's visit is basically designed to gather financial and 
political support for Renamo's electoral campaign. The source 
declined to give further details of Dhlakama's visit to South

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Do Not Write Off Peacekeeping Force--"It is by no means 
surprising that in the first two weeks there have been blow-ups" 
in the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF), says a page-12 
editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 8 February. 
"Sensible South Africans will beware of writing the force off 
too easily." The government should give the NPKF based at De 
Brug "a top-priority rating," and the African National Congress 
(ANC) "should resist any lurking temptations for a little cheap 
politicking." "It is also time for openness. There are no 
secrets in this army; no reasons to lock its men away. Let them 
be visible, so that future bust-ups and future successes alike 
can be seen clearly by the public and not left to the 
exaggeration of whisper." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC, NP Seek To Retain Police State Powers -- "When ANC and 
NP [National Party]-aligned delegates to the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] are called on by the DP's [Democratic 
Party] Colin Eglin to account today for their apparent 
reluctance to scrap detention without trial, the least they 
should do is blush," remarks a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English 8 February. "Clearly, there are little 
dictators in both parties who think the constitutional impasse 
is to be resolved, and a `free and far' election fought, with 
the backing of a 1980s-style law and order crackdown." BUSINESS 
DAY finds it "disturbing" that the ANC and the NP "are intent on 
retaining police state powers through sleight of hand -- it took 
the eagle-eyed Black Sash to notice and publicise this latest 
exercise in cynicism. And let us not forget that this is the 
second time the ANC and NP have acted covertly together to sneak 
through detention provisions -- the first occurred at Codesa 
[Convention for a Democratic South Africa] in 1992. Let us see 
how they squirm out of this one." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  Country `Does Have a Future' -- Gerald Shaw writes in his 
"Political Survey" column on page 6 of Cape Town CAPE TIMES in 
English on 4 February that in South Africa "there will by much 
sound and fury but the intermittent terrorism and sabotage of 
the fanatics will not stop the election." One estimate of the 
security situation which Shaw has seen, written by Colin Legum, 
"doyen of analysts of Southern Africa affairs," suggests that 
"Northern Ireland is the closest parallel to present-day South 
Africa, rather than Algeria on the brink of independence, when 
the army generals revolted against De Gaulle's policy and France 
itself seemed momentarily at risk. An Ulster-type situation is 
about as bad as things will get, it seems to me. The bombs will 
go off but life will go on. The main thing will be to convince 
the world in the next few months that South Africa does have a 
future." 
<H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>
  ANC-Freedom Alliance Talks on Verge of Collapse -- 
Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 6 February in a page-14 
editorial believes the ANC-Freedom Alliance talks "have all but 
collapsed." "The ANC and the government on the one hand, and 
the Alliance on the other, seem to be drifting further from each 
other." CITY PRESS does not understand how the ANC "can expect 
the Alliance to make commitments to a document they have not yet 
seen, let alone discussed." Alternately, if the alliance rejects 
the proposals, or shifts goalposts, "the rest of the country and 
the world will then know who is not interested in a peaceful 
resolution of the country's problems." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Problems With New Peacekeeping Force -- "The fact that the 
minister of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, found it necessary to 
instruct General Georg Meiring, chief of the army, to 
investigate alleged problems within the National Peacekeeping 
Force increases suspicions that all is not well within that 
force," notes Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 4 February in a 
page-8 editorial. "The name National Peacekeeping Force becomes 
a mockery if the rumors of unhygienic conditions, disease and 
lack of discipline, are true." "Strict disciplinary measures 
should be taken against those who refuse to cooperate in the 
creation of a respectable peacekeeping force." 
  Call for Action Against Right-Wing Threat to Peace -- 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 7 February in a page-8 
editorial says: "Conflict is building up in South Africa which 
could lead to full-scale civil war. If no definite action is 
taken now the country will get exactly what Mr. Eugene 
Terreblanche has been hoping for -- conflict between the 
Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB, and other right-wing 
organizations against the ANC and its allies. Mr. Terreblanche 
admitted that the right wing was responsible for the current 
terrorist attacks, and indicated that more attacks could be 
expected. His remarks reflect a knowledge of what is happening. 
He challenges and threatens. Has he even been questioned?" 
"ANC threats of retaliation are understandable. The endless 
attacks on ANC property cannot be tolerated." "Urgent action 
should be taken against those who threaten the peace. The time 
has come for drastic decisions and actions."

<F P=106> [Report from Cuito by correspondent Abel Abraao] </F>
  [Text] Clashes continue in the city of Cuito between 
government and National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] forces. Today, more than 5,000 shells were fired 
by UNITA at the martyred city of Cuito. The death toll 
resulting from UNITA's shelling has risen to 175. Hospital 
sources say about 350 people -- mostly children, elderly men, 
and women -- have been wounded. The hospital lacks the means to 
cope with the situation. 
  Today's clashes were fiercer than yesterday's. The city of 
Cuito has become a true inferno. Jonas Savimbi's UNITA 
continues to shell the city and mount strong attacks on it. The 
situation, however, is under the control of government forces, 
who continue to deal severe blows to the enemy of the people.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria Feb 7 SAPA -- Negotiations on an 
all-inclusive constitutional deal ended in acrimony on Monday [7 
February] night as the African National Congress (ANC), 
government and the Freedom Alliance [FA] warned that time to 
reach a deal was fast running out. 
  The parties, which have until Saturday to register for the 
April elections, emerged after four hours of talks to say that 
while some progress had been achieved, a settlement had once 
again eluded them. 
  ANC negotiator Joe Slovo said bluntly that the talks had 
reached deadlock. "Unless serious movement on the side on the 
Freedom Alliance is forthcoming, I would say there is no hope," 
Mr Slovo said. Even the implementation of a double ballot would 
become logistically difficult if the parties stalled for much 
longer. 
  His colleague, Mr Mohammed Valli Moosa, accused the alliance 
of shifting the goalposts. He said that while the alliance had 
earlier insisted on a double ballot as a precondition for a 
breakthrough, it was now principally concerned that regional 
constitutions should not be altered by the constitution-making 
body that will be elected in April. 
  Mr Valli Moosa said that the ANC had asked the alliance for 
a 
commitment to flexibility when the parties last met on Thursday 
last week. "Rather than exhibiting flexibility, the alliance 
has once again moved the goalposts," he said. 
  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer struck an 
optimistic note when he addressed reporters after the talks. He 
produced a "balance sheet" of negotiations. 
  He said there had been agreement on constitutional 
amendments 
involving the fiscal competence of regions, the inclusion of the 
name kwaZulu alongside that of Natal for the region, a 
constitutional principle on self-determination and agreement on 
two ballots if the package as a whole was accepted. 
  He said the alliance had agreed to take part in elections 
and 
to renounce violence but not to take part in transitional 
structures. There was uncertainty on the reincorporation of 
Bophuthatswana. "I believe that what we have is a situation 
that provides for acceptable solutions. I make a call on the 
relevant parties to give final consideration to the proposals," 
he said. 
  However, alliance spokesmen Rowan Cronje of Bophuthatswana 
and Mr Walter Felgate of the Inkatha Freedom Party in particular 
quickly dashed any hopes of a breakthrough. Acknowledging 
limited progress, Mr Cronje then went on to say the integrity of 
regional constitutions was a major issue. He said the ANC would 
not give way on the right of a constituent assembly to rewrite 
regional constitutions. 
  And Mr Felgate called Mr Meyer's balance sheet a "gross 
misrepresentation of the real issue". He said the ANC was 
"totally immovable" on the issue and was asking for a "blank 
cheque". 
  Mr Valli Moosa said the ANC was committed to the 
constitutional principles entrenched in the constitution and 
that any constitution it devised would be within the limits 
prescribed by the principles. 
  He said that not only were the Afrikaner volkstaat 
[homeland] 
demanding a mechanism that culminated in a volkstaat, but that 
both Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu were insisting on 
self-determination. 
  The negotiators are due to report back to their principals 
with a view to meeting again before the Saturday deadline.

<F P=106> [Report by Colette Braeckman: "Burundi: New Tutsi Prime </F>
Minister"] 
  [Excerpts] Calm has returned to Bujumbura, where they are 
awaiting the presentation of the new government formed by Prime 
Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko, responsible for public works and 
infrastructure under President Ndadaye. 
  Mr. Kanyenkiko, age 40, is a member of the Tutsi people and 
of Uprona [Unity for National Progress], the principal 
opposition party and formerly the country's only party. In 
appointing him as prime minister the new President Cyprien 
Ntaryamira has thus respected the agreement reached last week to 
free the country from its present deadlock and prevent any 
further upsurge of interethnic violence that left 50 dead last 
week. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Special Mission...To Liege </H5>
  Various sources report of Burundian officers or 
intermediaries close to the army being charged with "secret 
missions." 
  Last week an interlocutor introducing himself as former 
President Bagaza told us by telephone that 14 officers, 
putschists or close to the putschists, were in Europe, four of 
them in Belgium. Their mission could be to try to purchase arms. 
  Information from Germany also indicated the presence in 
Europe of putschist soldiers or those close to the faction 
members. Interviewed by telephone, Colonel Bikomagu seemed to 
confirm the defections of some officers and the fact that 
meetings had been held in Brussels and Charleroi. 
  According to the chief of staff, these officers are in 
France 
at the moment, after having had to leave Belgium due to the 
vigilance of the Burundian Embassy. 
  Certain sources also report that several Burundians, Messrs. 
Jean-Claude Ndiyo, Bondo, Nahimana, and Busuguru, stayed at the 
grand hotel in Liege from 24 to 28 January last, charged with 
taking delivery of 1,500 machine guns destined for the criminal 
investigation department. 
  A Belgian is apparently in Bujumbura at the moment providing 
training in the use of these weapons. 
  Information from the FN company of Herstal, a possible 
supplier of these machine guns, states that the company is not 
in the habit of divulging the names of its customers and any 
intermediaries. 
  FN nevertheless states that it is subject to very precise 
regulations: Every six months, it contacts the Economic Affairs 
Ministry to check that the beneficiary countries are not subject 
to an arms embargo. 
  In the case of Burundi, the FN management checked with the 
ministry just recently, and the reply was categoric: No export 
licences are at present being granted, with an embargo on all 
arms, and no contracts concluded under President Ndadaye may be 
respected. 
  The present Burundian Government has also decided to block 
any delivery of arms to the Burundian Army and a cargo is 
immobilized at the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, despite the 
efforts made by soldiers to take delivery of it.

  [Excerpt] Brazzaville, 8 Feb (PANA) -- Congolese Interior 
Minister Martin Mberi stated in Brazzaville that "partial 
elections cannot be held in confusion." The minister who was 
addressing a "forum" organized on the Congolese television, said 
the return of peace in the residential districts of Brazzaville 
is a precondition for holding these by-elections stipulated by 
the international arbitral college. 
  The by-elections will be held in nine constituencies where 
election results were canceled by the arbitral college. The 
college reviewed 58 petitions for annulment submitted by parties 
of the presidential group and the opposition after the early 
elections held last May and October. 
  Two out of the nine affected constituencies are in 
Brazzaville, one in Pointe Noire and the remaining in the 
country's northern regions. The outcome of the by-elections 
should not compromise the majority position held by the 
presidential group at the national assembly. The presidential 
group won 64 out of the 125 parliamentary seats. 
  In a statement on national television on 6 February, Mr. 
Mberi, who is a minister of state, expressed satisfaction with 
the "cease- fire agreement" concluded on 31 January by 
parliamentarians from the country's four southern regions.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 8 Feb (AFP) -- Some 20 top officers of 
the Congolese Army drew up a plan on 7 February for the 
effective implemention of the cease-fire agreement signed on 30 
January by the presidential group and opposition 
parliamentarians, it was learned on 8 February from a generally 
reliable source. 
  Just like the parliamentarians who signed the agreement, 
these top military officers are also natives of the four regions 
in southern Congo -- Niari, Bouenza, Lekoumou and Pool. In the 
past few months, citizens of the four regions of southern Congo 
have been locked up in clashes in Brazzaville that led to over 
200 deaths in the fight between militias of the presidential 
group and the opposition. 
  The plan was drawn up within closed doors in the presence of 
General Emmanuel Eta Onka, chief of general staff of the 
Congolese Armed Forces, and has been submitted to the 
intraregional parliamentary peace committee. Highlights of the 
plan have not yet been made public. 
  The military officers and committee members are expected to 
meet on 8 February to examine the plan, Mr. Goma Tsika, a 
parliamentarian serving on the committee, disclosed on the 
national television. 
  The rehabilitation of the Brazzaville-Pointe Noire railroad 
installations, sabotaged during the political violence, has been 
postponed pending the implementation of the plan. The repair 
work, anticipated in the cease-fire agreement, were initially 
scheduled to start on 1 February but was postponed to 8 February 
after an attack by opposition supporters on railway technicians 
leaving four dead. 
  Aside from the resumption of rail traffic that has been 
interrupted for the past two months, the cease-fire agreement 
also provides for the deployment of a buffer force and the 
dismantling of militia forces in Brazzaville.

  [Text] Libreville, 8 Feb (AGP-GAB/PANA) -- The Gabonese 
Trade Union Confederation [COSYGA] and affiliated unions have 
sent a general strike notice to Prime Minister Oye-Mba, 
according to a trade union source here. COSYGA and the 
affiliated trade unions may embark on a strike action next week 
"if the government does not find solutions to the social crisis 
arising from the 50 percent CFA franc devaluation," the same 
source stated. 
  The strike notice sent to the head of government yesterday 
reproached him for refusing to have dialogue with the unions and 
for showing no interest in negotiations on crucial and 
disturbing issues." Finding solutions to the crisis cannot be a 
monopoly of the government alone," they stressed, affirming that 
Gabon is a country where the rule of law prevails and as a 
result consultations must be the rule where actions involving 
the very existence of the nation are concerned." 
  In a platform, COSYGA and the affiliated unions are 
demanding 
above all the abolition of the National Solidarity Tax, the 
complementary tax on salaries lower than 500,000 CFA francs. 
The Central Gabonese Union is also demanding 50 percent 
reduction in the price of revenue bands and in the rate of 
indemnity on the income of natural persons and a fall in customs 
duties for essential commodities. Their claims relate also to 
the reorganization of trade, the reorientation of the National 
Housing Fund, the restructuring of parastatal companies, and the 
need to find a solution to the health workers strike. 
  It was also learned that in their strike notice, the 
Gabonese 
unionists finally expressed astonishment at the proposed 
establishment of a senate. In the communique issued after the 
cabinet meeting held on 4 February, the government had announced 
its decision to give parliament maximum flexibility and 
efficiency through the creation of a senate, they recalled. The 
unionists are against the establishment of a second chamber of 
parliament, they remarked. 
  Last week, COSYGA sent a list of complaints to the prime 
minister's office containing various claims, including an 80 
percent salary hike. The unionists consider that "the combined 
effects of the deterioration of the people's purchasing power 
and of the devaluation of the CFA franc authorize them to demand 
an increase.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 8 Feb (AFP) -- Emmanuel Kiro Kimathe, 
public works and territorial development minister in the 
Birindwa government who is facing a judicial enquiry, has 
announced that he began an indefinite hunger strike on 5 
February and that he will continue the strike until "justice is 
rendered." In a "note" he issued this morning to Prime Minister 
Faustin Birindwa and his colleagues in the cabinet, Mr. Kiro 
denounced the "total isolation he has been subjected to since 3 
February by being deprived of telephone calls and visits from 
his family." 
  Furthermore, Mr. Kiro, who was placed under house arrest at 
the "Cite de l'OUA" government estates in Kinshasa on 14 
January, is protesting against the "arbitrary nature of the 
emergency proceedings instituted by the public prosecutor's 
office" against him. On 8 January, Marshal Mobutu Sese Sekou 
issued a decree requesting the opening of a judicial enquiry at 
the attorney general's office against Professor Kiro "for the 
illegal sale and renting of public buildings in Kinshasa and the 
interior." 
  Mr. Kiro was a very active radical opposition member in the 
past and a former minister under Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi. He 
joined Mr. Birindwa's government at its formation at the end of 
the political conclave convened by Marshall Mobutu in 1993. Mr. 
Kiro was a member of the Political Forces of the Conclave 
delegation -- the presidential group -- in the negotiations with 
the radical opposition held between September and December. He 
was appointed member of the new parliament, the High Council of 
the Republic-Transitional Parliament, which was formed following 
the negotiations.

  [Text] A statement from the presidency says the Somali 
people are outraged by the disinformation from Italian Defense 
Minister Fabio Fabbri about the current situation in Somalia. 
The statement said the defense minister's utterances are far 
from the actual situation in Somalia. This is not the first 
time the Italian defense minister has issued such 
disinformation. The statement said it is unfortunate that such 
remarks should be made by an Italian senior minister, adding 
that it is an issue that could seriously dent the excellent 
bilateral relations and cooperation existing between the two 
nations. 
  The statement said it has become a habit of senior Italian 
officials to make misleading statements about Somalia with the 
deliberate intention of painting a negative picture of the 
prevailing situation in Somalia. The statement said the remarks 
made by the Italian defense minister are unfortunate, 
misleading, and made without proper research on the subject. 
  The statement said the recent confrontation that took place 
in Balcad, Shabeelaha Dhexe region, was caused by an intentional 
provocation by the Italian soldiers, which led to deaths and 
injuries on both sides. The statement said the Government of 
Somalia is optimistic that, in the future, Italian leaders will 
consult their representative in Somalia before uttering 
misleading statements that could cause disinformation about a 
particular incident. It warned Italian officers against 
dramatizing minor incidents as well as avoiding matters that 
might trigger provocation between Italian soldiers and the local 
people. The statement advised Italian soldiers and officers to 
carry out their duties in accordance with the UN Operation in 
Somalia mandate.

afternoon, the vice chairman of the NRC, Alhaji Moses Kigongo, 
called for an adjournment of 15 minutes to allow for more NRC 
members to come and form a quorum, as there were only 50 
members. After 25 minutes of waiting, the house was called to 
order, only to find that there was still no quorum. The house 
was set to deliberate on the government white paper on education

  [Excerpt] The communique that UNITA had promised for today 
pertaining to the government's military offensive in northern 
Angola has not yet been issued. The UNITA communique is 
anxiously awaited because no one knows the extent that the 
intensification of the war will influence the Lusaka talks. 
Information concerning who controls Cuito is contradictory. 
Since Saturday [5 February], 150 people have been killed and 
400 injured. Our correspondent Carlos Albuquerque reports. 
  [Albuquerque] The military situation in Angola has 
deteriorated in the last few hours. There are contradictory 
reports regarding what is really happening. In statements to 
the local radio, the Bie police commander said that his forces, 
backed by civil defense forces, took some of UNITA's positions 
as a response to provocation from Jonas Savimbi's troops. Other 
sources say that the government forces had totally retaken Cuito 
following intense fighting with UNITA rebels, who are said to 
have fled and to be bombarding the city now with heavy artillery 
from positions between the capital of the province and the 
village of Cunje, which is controlled by the government. 
  The National Radio's correspondent in Cuito said in the 
early 
hours of the morning that the city was once again like an 
inferno after being hit by more than 5,000 shells and that more 
than 170 people -- mostly women and children -- had been killed 
and the total number of injured had risen to about 400. The 
local hospital has no capacity to cope with the situation. It 
is feared many of the wounded will die in the next few hours. 
  Officials from Bie's provincial government have launched 
dramatic appeals to the international community, especially to 
the United States, to help end the war, which is killing 
thousands of Angolans. They have come out against what they 
consider to be the world's constant attention to what is 
happening in former Yugoslavia and ignoring what is happening in 
Angola. 
  In other areas of the country, there are also signs of a 
deteriorating military situation. Sources have told us that 
UNITA is moving troops in the (Celes) region in Cuanza Sul, 
toward the city of Sumbe, and that government troops are trying 
to recapture the area of the Catanda Dam in Malanje Province are 
moving toward Huambo. 
  In the meantime, a communique by the Luanda government 
blames 
UNITA for the intensification of the war and accuses it of 
wanting to sabotage the Lusaka talks. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Several people died in the past eight hours in 
nonstop shelling by National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola bandits against the martyred city of Cuito. While the 
war claims more victims, famine increases every tenth of a 
second because relief operations have been suspended, affecting 
more than 130,000 people. Should the situation continue, famine 
and war could claim 50 lives daily. The hospital recently 
renovated by the Belgian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres 
has been shut down and the patients left to their own devices. 
Hospital sources say the hospital is providing only first aid 
treatment.

<F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Pedro Manuel] </F>
  [Text] Good evening. The talks are virtually at a 
standstill while the main body of the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiating team is awaited. 
  Meanwhile, the mediators and the government delegation are 
busy with something else. There are reports that the government 
team has already reacted to the proposal from the mediators and 
observers on the question of national reconciliation and the 
UNAVEM [UN Angola Verification Mission] mandate. Analysts 
believe the mediators today dealt with the government 
delegation's views on UNAVEM. In the case of national 
reconciliation the government team introduced no major changes, 
though the same cannot be said of the UNAVEM mandate. The 
government has proposed changes because, according to a source, 
it is necessary for the government and the United Nations to 
define juridical aspects so that the government's legal rights 
are upheld. 
  Right now, the talks are dealing with national 
reconciliation 
and the UNAVEM mandate. The talks will only get off the ground 
when the main body of the UNITA delegation returns to Lusaka, 
probably tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report on statements by Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special </F>
representative in Angola, in Luanda on 8 February--passages 
within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Chief Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special 
representative in Angola, was received this afternoon by 
President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The two 
exchanged views for some 30 minutes, particularly about the 
Angolan peace process. At the end of the audience, Blondin Beye 
was still the same man -- optimistic and confident. He said not 
even the latest military developments, particularly in Cuito, 
can stop the Lusaka negotiating process. 
  [Beye in French, fading into Portuguese translation] "The 
(?derailments) that we have seen in the past 48 hours will not 
[words indistinct], but we will continue." 
  Beye had just arrived from Cote d'Ivoire, where he attended 
the funeral ceremonies for Felix Houphouet-Boigny. While in 
that country he also discussed the complicated Angolan problem, 
meeting various officials. 
  [Beye] "I held talks with people involved in or worried 
about 
the Angolan dispute, notably the Ivorian authorities, the U.S. 
delegation and in particular George Moose, and the Portuguese 
delegation led by the minister of cooperation. I had useful 
talks with the Moroccan prime minister. I also met with the 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
delegation led by its secretary general and head of the UNITA 
team to the Lusaka talks. We discussed the latest developments." 
  Obviously, Beye was referring to the situation in Cuito, 
where Jonas Savimbi's men have launched new attacks. Beye 
regrets the situation. 
  [Beye] "I regret it profoundly. There is no need for it. It 
is necessary that what we do in Lusaka coincides with how people 
behave on the ground. We will tackle the situation, but we 
cannot do anything without the political will of both the 
government and UNITA. I still believe that both the government 
and UNITA have opted for dialogue. These derailments and 
confusion are deplorable, but we will do our best to cope with 
the situation." 
  Beye did not elaborate. He said the confusion is like 
flames fanned at a time when peace is near, adding: There are 
the enemies of peace and those who are afraid of peace. Blondin 
Beye leaves for Lusaka tomorrow.

<F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Lusaka peace talks have taken a breather. At 
a time when national reconciliation is being discussed, the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] is 
linking the resumption of the peace talks to an inquiry team 
being sent to Cuito and Huambo to establish who was responsible 
for the resumption of hostilities. At least, that was what 
UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim, spokesman for the 
UNITA team to Lusaka, told the BBC yesterday. 
  [Begin Valentim recording] Our stance is quite clear: We are 
prepared to continue the talks. The UNITA team will stay on in 
Luanda, and it will continue to negotiate with the observers, 
the mediators, and the government's delegation. However, to 
save peace in Angola, we have asked that an inquiry team be set 
up and sent to Bie and Huambo to establish the identity of and 
condemn the aggressor so that peace can be saved in Angola. [end 
recording] 
  Meanwhile, reports reaching us from Luanda are less than 
encouraging. It appears that the government is also hardening 
its stance. In fact, yesterday the Angolan authorities said 
they will not give in to what they described as absurd proposals 
by UNITA. Analysts see this as an indication that the government 
wishes to make no national reconciliation package concessions.

  [Text] In Angola, both UNITA and the government are 
questioning the validity of the Lusaka talks. Rui Oliveira, the 
UNITA representative in Lisbon, has said that the government has 
returned to a strategy of war, and he cites Luanda's armament 
effort as an example. 
  [Begin Oliveira recording] It is the MPLA that is practicing 
a strategy of war. It is buying war materiel from Brazil, 
Russia, and Spain; buying materiel in North Korea. Portugal is 
also involved. As we all know, as it is generally known, 
Portugal is giving the MPLA, the Luanda government military aid. 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] That was Rui Oliveira of UNITA in Lisbon, the 
spokesman for the accusations that do not even spare Portugal. 
The Angolan Government says it is only defending itself. 
  [Begin David Mendes, Angolan secretary of state for the 
environment, recording] UNITA is not passive, it is using force. 
And [words indistinct] control the use of force, then we also 
defend ourselves with force. The government's purchase of war 
materiel was not part of its plan. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] That was David Mendes, Angolan secretary of 
state 
for the environment, who is currently in Lisbon. In Angola the 
military conflict is being intensified. There are reports of 
air raids on Huambo. Both the government and UNITA claim to 
control 85 percent of Cuito.

  [Editorial Report] Abidjan La Chaine Nationale Une 
Television Network in French on 7 February carries in its 
regular 2000 GMT newscast a report on the final obsequies of the 
Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny at the Our Lady of 
Peace Basilica in Yamoussoukro. The announcer says the ceremony 
"started this morning at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny Foundation 
for the Promotion of Peace, where the wake continued throughout 
the night Saturday, 5 February, until this morning. The remains 
were then transferred to the Our Lady of Peace Basilica for the 
requiem mass." 
  The video shows Houphouet-Boigny's coffin, which is draped 
in 
the national colors, being carried by military officers in 
ceremonial dress to the basilica. A long procession of about 15 
Catholic bishops from Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Togo, 
and Senegal and a representative of the pope, as well as priests 
and mass servers, precede the coffin, which was immediately 
followed by the widowed first lady, Marie-Therese 
Houphouet-Boigny, who is flanked by President Henri Konan Bedie 
and his wife. 
  The announcer says that "many foreign heads of state came to 
join us in our pain to participate in this requiem mass. They 
include Togolese President Gnassignbe Eyadema, Cameroonian 
President Paul Biya, Congolese President Pascal Lissouba, 
Guinean President Lansana Conte, Niger President Mahamane 
Ousmane, Gabonese President Omar Bongo, Cape Verdean President 
Antonio Monteiro, Chadian President Idriss Deby, Namibian 
President Sam Nujoma, Guinea-Bissau President Bernardo Vieira, 
Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara, Burkinabe President Blaise 
Compaore, Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, and French President 
Francois Mitterrand." He continues: "Also to be noted is the 
attendance of Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Zairean 
President Mobutu Sese Seko, Malian President Alpha Oumar Konare, 
Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings, and other high-ranking 
political personalities," adding that the presence of all these 
foreign dignitaries shows "how much President Houphouet-Boigny 
was held in high esteem outside our country." 
  In his homily, Monsignor Bernard Aggrey, bishop of the 
Yamoussoukro Diocese, who co-celebrated the mass with Cardinal 
Bernardin Gantin, special representative of Pope John-Paul II, 
said: "That President Houphouet-Boigny was a prestigious 
traditional and modern chief, acclaimed worldwide, testifies to 
this rainbow of personalities who have come from all over the 
world to pay their last tribute. Houphouet-Boigny, who, in his 
lifetime, was overwhelmed with honor, loaded with glory, and 
covered with praises from everywhere, breathed his last during 
the early morning of 7 December 1993 and then joined God the 
Father, who created him, like other men, in his image and 
likeness." 
  After the mass, the long procession of clergy left the 
basilica, followed by the immediate family of the deceased, who 
then lined up in front of the building to receive the 
condolences of all the heads of state and the delegations who 
attended the mass. The coffin was then carried out of the 
basilica by the same group of military officers and handed over 
to the family. The cloth of national colors in which the coffin 
was draped was neatly folded and handed to Marie-Therese 
Houphouet-Boigny, according to the announcer. The coffin was 
then placed on an Army vehicle and driven to the gates of the 
president's personal residence, where the coffin was formally 
handed over to the family. The video shows a large crowd 
watching the coffin as it is taken into the compound of the 
residence. The announcer says the burial will be restricted to 
family members.

  [Excerpt] Yamoussoukro, 8 Feb (PANA) -- Official sources in 
Yamoussoukro have disclosed that franc zone member states held a 
summit there on the recent CFA franc devaluation yesterday 
evening. The summit was held a few hours after the official 
funeral of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who died on 7 
December. 
  According to Ivorian Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, 
the 
14 African member states and France took stock of the situation 
following the decision made at the 10 and 11 January Dakar 
summit to change the CFA exchange rate. Kablan Duncan, who was 
the summit's spokesman, told newsmen that France did not make 
any new commitments on back up measures aimed at reducing the 
negative effects of the devaluation on the economies of the 14 
African partners within the franc zone. Mr. Duncan further said 
that Paris has, however, decided to continue backing them at the 
Bretton Woods institutions and has urged them to speed up their 
economic integration. 
  Cameroonian President Paul Biya says he is encouraged by 
France's confirmation that it is willing to support efforts made 
to get Africa out of the economic crisis. He therefore called 
on the IMF and the World Bank to "set up the announced back up 
measures as soon as possible." The Cameroonian president stated 
that "the risk of social explosion increases with each passing 
day." He denied that his country intends to withdraw from the 
franc zone and to create its own currency. He concluded by 
saying that the "franc zone is a zone for solidarity and for 
people to wage a better struggle as a group." 
  The summit started at 1900 and was expected to last 30 
minutes but it ended nearly two hours later. Those who attended 
the summit included French President Mitterrand, French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur, heads of state of seven West African 
Monetary Union countries, as well as the heads of state of six 
countries belonging to the Bank of Central African States.

  [Text] The presence of representatives of foreign 
institutions and African and European heads of state was the 
occasion for a mini-summit on the CFA franc devaluation, a 
situation which African countries of the franc zone have been 
experiencing for over one month. At the summit, which took 
place on the sidelines of President Houphouet-Boigny's funeral, 
the 13 African countries of the CFA zone deplored the 
consequences of the devaluation of their currency. No measure 
was announced after the mini-summit. Nevertheless, before his 
flight, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was eager to 
reiterate France's solidarity with the African member countries 
of the franc zone. Here is an extract of the statement of the 
French head of government at Yamoussoukro. 
  [Begin Balladur recording] Twenty-six days after the 
decision 
of the African countries to devalue the CFA franc, the situation 
is better than one could foresee. Certainly, there are multiple 
difficulties here and there, relating for instance to the size 
of the debt. This is the first category of problems which we 
discussed. 
  The second category related to the situation of enterprises, 
be it French enterprises in Africa or African enterprises. We 
discussed how to help them in their transitional period and it 
was observed that the development fund already had the necessary 
means to cope with the situation, at least in the coming months. 
The third problem discussed is the relations between 
international institutions and these countries. As you know, 
the director general of the IMF and the president of the World 
Bank were invited to come and see me on 6 January. I pointed 
out to them the major interest of the international institutions 
in helping the African states if the latter took the decision to 
devalue. I remember [IMF Director] Mr. Camdessus and [World 
Bank President] Mr. Preston then made a proposal to me. This 
undertaking was renewed with these countries when they met in 
Dakar. Everyone agrees that there are measures that need to be 
taken at the national level. At any rate, France has decided to 
spare no trouble or effort. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Communique issued by Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita </F>
in Bamako; date not given; read by Bakary Koniba Traore, 
minister of equipment and transportation and government 
spokesman--recorded] 
  [Text] In view of the current political and social 
situation and the many disturbances that have affected our 
capital for some time now, I feel the need to make certain 
clarifications in my capacity as head of government. More than 
ever before, I would like to reaffirm my unflinching 
determination, as well as the determination of the government 
that I have the honor to head, to primarily resort to dialogue 
with all our partners in order to find solutions to the problems 
of our nation. We have taken cognizance of the defection of a 
few cabinet members at this time of a serious crisis that is 
affecting our country and the entire West African subregion. We 
believe that all democrats and patriots--all true sons of 
Mali--wherever they may be, will understand the need to join 
hands in our efforts to overcome the current predicaments and to 
avert threats against the democratic process and the very future 
of our nation. 
  For a few days, disturbances have been taking place in 
schools with the attendant threat to the freedom of citizens and 
to their property. I would like to appeal to all partners in 
the Malian educational sector -- school administrators, 
teachers, parents, and students -- to primarily resort to 
peaceful negotiations as the only way to safeguard this school 
year. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all 
sincere democrats and patriots to get involved in efforts to 
stop all adventurers who would like to plunge our country into 
anarchy. 
  We reiterate our unflinching determination to enforce the 
laws of the land, to protect citizens and their property, and to 
maintain law and order. Any instigation to revolt through false 
rumors or defamatory statements designed to incite hatred among 
Malians, at a time when our country rather needs to heal its 
wounds and restore national reconciliation, will be punished in 
accordance with the law. No great and lasting development can 
be achieved in disorder and insecurity. Our country has enough 
human and natural resources to overcome this crisis on condition 
that we all set to work in discipline.

  [Text] We now know the final decision of Youth and Sports 
Minister Boubacar Karamoko Coulibaly in the wake of his talks 
with the head of state yesterday. While respecting the decision 
of his party, the Party for Democracy and Progress, to withdraw 
from the government, he says that, as a patriot, he is duty 
bound to pursue the work that he has started with the support of 
the Malian youth and sports community, in particular, and the 
Malian people, in general. As a result, Boubacar Karamoko 
Coulibaly says that, out of respect for the Malian people and as 
a citizen, he has decided to remain in the government in order 
to make his modest contribution to the construction of a 
democratic and prosperous Malian state.

  [Text] Following the intertribal conflict in Ghana, about 
3,500 Ghanaians have for the past week been taking refuge in 
northern Togo as they flee current ethnic clashes in the Bimbila 
Region, situated at 370 km north of Accra, which shares a common 
border with Togo's Dankin border province. Degni Adjama brings 
you the details. 
  [Adjama] About 2,000 of these fugitives, mostly children and 
youths, arrived between 1 and 5 February, and their movement has 
increased since 6 February. According to the Ghanaian press, 
the Bimbila clashes between the Konkomba and Nanumba tribal 
communities have already claimed at least eight lives. Although 
the Ghana-Togo border has supposedly been closed since 5 
January, customs officers have not prevented the fleeing 
Ghanaians from entering Togo. Anyway, most of the fugitives 
entered Togolese territory through uncontrolled areas.

  [Excerpts] The Freedom Alliance says it will make no more 
concessions in talks with the government and the ANC [African 
National Congress]. At a leaders' summit that ended in Pretoria 
a short while ago, the alliance said any further initiative to 
break the deadlock in negotiations would have to come from the 
ANC. [passage omitted] We have a report from Gary Alfonso in 
Pretoria: 
  Freedom Alliance negotiators arrived for the summit to 
report 
back to their leaders about last night's deadlock. After a 
two-hour meeting, the writing was on the wall. Alliance 
Chairman Rowan Cronje said that their group could not and would 
not make any more concessions. IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said his party would not feel 
threatened by the looming deadline for parties to register for 
the election. That means if no compromise is reached on the 
issue of entrenching powers for regions in the constitution, the 
Alliance parties will not register, and that means that they 
will not take part in the election. The Alliance members say 
the ball, and their continued participation, is now in the hands 
of the ANC and the government.

negotiations with the government and the ANC [African National 
Congress]. Our political staff reports that it is now almost 
certain that the group will not participate in the election. 
[passage omitted] 
  The government's chief negotiator, Mr. Roelf Meyer, said the 
Alliance was making a big mistake in withdrawing from the 
negotiations. He said progress had been made in the past two 
weeks with the ANC and the government having made concessions. 
He said parties which did not take part in the election were 
minimizing their political roles. Mr. Meyer invited individual 
parties in the Alliance to take part in more negotiations.

Earlier the ANC denied that the two leaders had met, saying 
that Mr. Mandela had spent the day resting. Matters discussed 
apparently included Bophuthatswana's attitude to 
reincorporation, its participation in the election and free 
political activity in Bophuthatswana.

leaders to end the national peace force project as it will not 
serve its purpose. Speaking in Pretoria, Gen. Viljoen called on 
political leaders not to waste manpower on an experiment which 
the current commander acknowledged would not work. He said it 
bordered on the irresponsible to rush the force through training 
before turning it loose in a politically unstable country. 
  The DP [Democratic Party] candidate for the premiership in 
the Western Cape, Mr. Henie Bester, has said the National 
Peacekeeping Force is fast turning into a security farce. 
Speaking at an interparty breakfast meeting in Cape Town, he 
said alternative arrangements would have to be made urgently to 
ensure a free and fair election in April and economic growth 
afterwards.

it had held a meeting today with the commander of the force, 
Major General Gabriel Ramushwana, and the acting commander, 
Colonel Fred Burger. 
  The subcouncil and the force's command council would visit 
the training base at De Brug near Bloemfontein, and everything 
was being done to ensure that the peacekeeping force was a 
success. The subcouncil said a media day would be held at the 
base on Thursday [10 February].

Subcouncil on Law and Order, Security, and Stability said the 
retention or repeal of Section 29 of the Internal Security Act 
had never been on its agenda, nor had the council sought or 
received advice on the matter from the police. Earlier the TEC 
was sharply criticized for an alleged decision to retain 
detention without trial.

  [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] today 
showed for the first time since its establishment that it is 
able to exercise its authority, when the chief of the kwaZulu 
Police [KZP], Lieutenant General Roy During, testified before 
the council after a long delay. This follows an earlier report 
by Justice Richard Goldstone on so-called hit squads in the KZP. 
This report by Ronel Van Zyl: 
  KZP Commissioner Lt. Gen. Roy During had up till today 
refused to respond to requests by the TEC that he appear before 
them. On Friday it was agreed that he would do so, after an 
out-of-court agreement between the TEC and the kwaZulu minister 
of police. Three KZP members were suspended after the Goldstone 
report. 
  In his evidence, Gen. During maintained that he was not 
aware 
of any other KZP members who were involved in hit squads. He 
added, however, that other allegations were being investigated 
by the South African Police at his request. Gen. During was 
pressed by questions on KZP members who had been trained by the 
South African Defense Force in Caprivi. It was obvious that the 
council wanted to determine whether there is any link between 
those KZP members trained in Caprivi and the hit squads. 
  Gen. During admitted that the allegations about hit squads 
in 
the KZP had been surfacing for many years. He emphasized that 
he had personally initiated investigations into these 
allegations, with the approval of Chief Minister Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi. At the end of the hearing the TEC did not make any 
ruling, except that the investigations into the matter were far 
from completed. Gen. During said he was prepared to appear 
again before the council.

  [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has moved 
to take over control of broadcasting licenses from the 
government, and wants the Independent Broadcasting Authority to 
be in operation by the middle of next month. 
  A member of the TEC Management Committee, Mr. Mac Maharaj, 
said there was concern about the way in which Home Affair 
Minister Danie Schutte had granted temporary licenses to 15 
radio stations. He proposed that the TEC authorize the 
management committee to create a substructure to advise it on a 
process of short-listing applicants to the Independent 
Broadcasting Authority.

<F P=106> [Report by Adrian Hadland] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria--The SA [South African] arms industry was 
gearing itself for substantial gains in the export of military 
and technical products to the international market, Denel 
spokesman Paul Holtzhausen said yesterday. Huge overseas 
interest, particularly in niche products such as the G5 and G6 
cannon as well as the Roivalk [red falcon] helicopter, had seen 
a steady stream of international visitors arriving in SA for 
"courtesy calls", Holtzhausen said. 
  A delegation from France's senate commission on foreign 
affairs, defence and armed forces arrived in Johannesburg 
yesterday. Led by former French defence minister Yvon Bourges, 
the delegation will meet Denel and Armscor [Armaments 
Corporation of South Africa] representatives, as well as Defence 
Minister Kobie Coetsee and other political leaders. 
  Also in the country is a delegation from the U.S. Department 
of Defence, led by Assistant Secretary of Defence for Regional 
Security Affairs Chas Freeman. A U.S. embassy spokesman said, 
however, the U.S. delegation was not in SA to pursue arms 
industry contacts but was more interested in ways in which the 
U.S. defence department could help the development and 
integration of SA's new defence force. 
  Until the final lifting of the UN arms embargo, possibly 
soon 
after the April election, contact between the SA arms industry 
and the international market was limited to the strengthening of 
existing ties and "making people aware of what SA has to offer," 
Holtzhausen said. 
  SA's representation at the Malaysian air show last December 
marked the first time local arms manufactures had displayed 
their wares in the lucrative Pacific Rim market. Other regions 
with strong export potential included the Middle East and Europe. 
  Holtzhausen said Denel military-related exports represented 
about 17 percent of its R[rand]2bn[billion] income for the 
1993/94 financial year. Despite difficult times, the company 
hoped to duplicate these figures if not surpass them in the 
coming year, he said. While Denel had embarked upon an active 
international marketing campaign, it also hoped to find buyers 
for its commercial, mining and medical products as well as seek 
out possible alliances and joint ventures.

South Africa has suffered other alterations. His meeting with 
Thabo Mbeki, national chairman of the African National Congress,

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  South African-Zimbabwean Relations Thaw -- Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 9 February in a page-14 editorial believes 
the "previously frosty relations between South Africa and 
Zimbabwe" are continuing to thaw. The "latest defrosting is 
marked by the meeting in Harare between South Africa's Minister 
of Justice, Kobie Coetsee, and his Zimbabwean counterpart, 
Emerson Mnangagwa." An earlier meeting between President Mugabe 
and President F.W. de Klerk resulted in the "revival of the 
extradition treaty between the two states." Now Zimbabwe is 
urged to "heed South African pleas for the release of five 
prisoners" who are "suspected South African agents, who were 
captured and convicted for their role in destabilising Zimbabwe 
during the height of the armed struggle." These men "deserve 
the same right to amnesty as the hundreds of men and women who 
have been freed from prison since De Klerk's decision to seek a 
solution around the negotiating table rather than on the 
battlefield." 
  Right Wing, Buthelezi Play Kamikaze Politics -- Allister 
Sparks writes in an article on the same page that the right wing 
and Inkatha Chief Buthelezi are engaging in "Kamikaze politics," 
and "self-destruction with a vengeance." "Sure the right wing 
can launch a campaign of sabotage and terrorism. They can make 
things extremely uncomfortable and do great damage to the new 
South Africa. But in the process they will set themselves up as 
the targets of vengeance and loathing for years to come. No 
minority group can survive that for long. If ever there was a 
formula for national suicide, this is it." Chief Buthelezi of 
the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) is also following this hardball 
strategy pursued by the right wing. Sparks believes the "true 
explanation" for this is that "his ego is such that he cannot 
face the prospect of fighting an election he is likely to lose, 
and so he wants out. From the beginning Buthelezi has wanted to 
secure for himself a third position equal in status to that of 
Nelson Mandela and President de Klerk. He now knows this is 
unattainable and he cannot come to terms with the idea of 
playing second fiddle to anyone." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Criticism of COSATU Undemocratic Support for Single Ballot 
-- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 9 February in a page 10 
editorial asks "someone who understands democracy" to "pay a 
call" on Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) 
headquarters. "Lessons in the workings of a democratic system, 
and a word or two about political tolerance, are sorely needed." 
The COSATU leadership "clearly does not understand" that the 
"single ballot it supports so fervently is undemocratic. It 
clearly cannot appreciate that people could oppose the single 
ballot on democratic grounds without aligning themselves with 
any party political cause. And it ignores the fact that the DP 
[Democratic Party] an the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] also 
support the double ballot -- two parties which can hardly be 
said to be in bed with the right wing. COSATU deeply resents 
anyone taking a view opposed to the ANC/COSATU `line'." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Danger of Sidelining Freedom Alliance -- Johannesburg 
SOWETAN 
in English on 9 February in a page 8 editorial warns there are 
"dangers" which can be prompted by sidelining the Freedom 
Alliance (FA). Although the FA "does not have the will to 
fight," and there are many civil servants in the homelands who 
"are not happy to sacrifice everything for the ambitions of 
their political masters," there are "elements in the FA who have 
the ability to terrorise the people of this country." 
Therefore, "it makes sense to forge a deal now before the 
country is plunged into civil strife. This should be done 
without compromising the sovereignty or integrity of the new 
South Africa."

  [Text] Lagos, 8 Feb. (NAN/PANA)--The minister of petroleum 
and mineral resources, Don Etiebet, left Lagos on Tuesday [8 
February] for a one-week visit to Saudi Arabia and Qatar to seek 
ways of increasing world crude oil prices. Etiebet will meet 
his Saudi counterpart, Hisham Muhyi-al-Din Nazir, and OPEC 
President 'Abdallah Bin-Hamad al-'Attiyah, who is also the 
minister of energy and industry in Qatar. Nigeria, Saudi Arabia 
and Qatar are members of OPEC. Etiebet said the trip had become 
necessary in view of the "ridiculous prices" of crude oil and 
called for measures to shore up the prices.

  [Text] Security forces have dispersed a student general 
assembly in Cotonou. Andre Maniani has the details: 
  [Maniani] The Beninese security forces made every effort to 
disperse the demonstrators, therefore the huge general assembly 
planned by the students at the Cotonou Trade Fair Center could 
not be held. Nonetheless, thousands of students circulated 
throughout Cotonou in buses chanting (?antigovernment) slogans. 
  The Beninese students are protesting the new decree whose 
contents fix the conditions for obtaining scholarships and 
allowances. According to Article 12 of the decree, scholarships 
are awarded to the most deserving students, to those who 
qualify, and to those who have the right connections. Students 
are demonstrating against the decree. According to the 
students, a close reading of the decree leaves one frustrated at 
the fact that Nicephore Soglo's regime is trying to block the 
way of knowledge to the most destitute. Scholarships that were 
automatically awarded to students in the third year of the 
university first cycle can no longer be awarded if one's average 
grade falls below 11.51. 
  The other motives for this abortive general assembly include 
working conditions, student residences, the quality of lectures, 
and the longstanding problem of public transportation. Despite 
the intervention of the security forces, thousands of students 
went to the venue of the general assembly at the Cotonou Trade 
Fair Center and swore to plan another meeting in the coming days. 
  In any case, Nicephore Soglo's regime is far from being out 
of the woods.

  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] has called for the 
scrapping of Section 29 of the Internal Security Act, which 
allows for detention without trial, and castigated the 
Transitional Executive Council for not abolishing the 
legislation. This followed the TEC's decision to retain 
provisionally Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. IFP 
spokesman Ed Tillet said in a statement in Durban that the TEC's 
decision made a mockery of the lengthy campaign fought by the 
ANC [African National Congress] and its allies to have the 
legislation removed from the statute books.

  [Text] Bujumbura, Feb 9 (AFP) -- New Burundi President 
Cyprien Ntaryamira and his Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko 
announced the makeup of their new government late Wednesday [9 
February] on national radio and television. 
  Ntaryamira kept a promise to draw his government from both 
his own party the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) and 
the main opposition Party of Unity and National Progress 
(UPRONA), a government source said. 
  The source said that the 60 percent of government seats 
would 
go to the FRODEBU and the rest would be made up of the UPRONA. 
  Ntaryamira, a member of the majority Hutu tribe, was elected 
president after the murder of former president Melchior Ndadaye, 
the country's first Hutu leader. 
  His murder in a failed coup bid on October 21 unleashed a 
tide of tribal violence between the Hutu and Tusi tribes, which 
left an estimated 100,000 people dead and caused another 700,000 
to flee.

said at the time of the mini-summit meeting in Yamoussoukro that 
Cameroon would not leave the franc zone, the daily newspaper 
CAMEROON TRIBUNE reported on Wednesday [9 February]. 
  The newspaper said that the remarks by the president put an 
end to rumors appearing in parts of the French press that 
Cameroon would leave the franc zone in the wake of the 
devaluation of the CFA franc in mid-January. 
  The leader of the radical opposition, John Fru Ndi, 
suggested 
that Cameroon should exit the zone and create its own currency.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 9 Feb (AFP) -- At least three people 
were shot dead and another seriously wounded this afternoon in 
Brazzaville by armed men who opened fire on a bus, it was 
learned from a hospital source. 
  This aggression, perpetrated by unidentified individuals, 
took place at the southern entrance of the Bacongo area, one of 
the areas most affected by fighting between militiamen of the 
presidential group and the opposition in the past few months. 
  According to a military source, this attack "may have been 
perpetrated by forces hostile to the return of calm in the 
capital; but this will not jeopardize the ongoing peace process 
engaged by the parliamentarians," with the signing of a 
cease-fire accord on 30 January by deputies of both the 
presidential group and the opposition. 
  This attack is the first violent incident recorded in the 
southern areas of Brazzaville since the cease-fire is in force.

  [Excerpts] The Alliance for Democracy in Mali [ADEMA] held 
its second news conference at its headquarters today in 
continuation of its policy of permanent contact with the media. 
The conference dealt with the new political and economic 
situation in our country. Mahamadou Kone has this report: 
  [Kone] The newsmen at the conference took the opportunity to 
ask questions about our country's current political and economic 
situation, a situation that is marked, among other things, by 
the devaluation of the CFA franc, the resignation of Prime 
Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, the appointment of a new 
government, and the subsequent cabinet reshuffle. It will be 
recalled that the reshuffle was prompted by the withdrawal of 
the ministers from the National Committee for Democratic 
Initiative [CNID] and the Rally for Democracy and Progress 
[RDP]. [passage omitted] 
  This political situation led to speculations that the 
government would call early elections, a possibility that ADEMA 
Secretary General Mohamadoun Dicko has ruled out: 
  [Begin Dicko recording] We are still open to everyone; we 
continue to champion dialogue; we still want to join hands with 
all democratic forces because we know that we need everyone if 
we really want to speed up our march toward establishing and 
consolidating the rule of law, and strengthening our young, 
fragile democracy. Despite the withdrawal of CNID and RDP, we 
are resolutely open to everyone -- to all those who want to help 
consolidate our democracy -- but there is no question of calling 
early elections. No, there is no need. We trust our people and 
our ability to run this country. [end recording] 
  [Kone] Mr. Dicko said accountability prevails in the 
drafting 
and implementation of the republican pact, adding that since 
some of the signatories to the pact have questioned it, ADEMA is 
preparing a new document on the joint management of state 
affairs. The ADEMA secretary general stated, however, that the 
ruling party has qualified men and can run the country alone, 
but it prefers consultations. 
  Mr. Dicko said the devaluation of the CFA franc will 
undoubtedly reduce the purchasing power of the people. To 
alleviate the hardship, the ADEMA head suggested a change in our 
consumption habits and the promotion of solidarity among all 
Malians.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Abdoulaye Sidibe] </F>
  [Text] The country is at a turning point, at a crossroads. 
More than ever before, this expression goes with the 
sociopolitical situation prevailing in our country. After 
September 1960, after 26 March 1991, our country is today at the 
same decisive turning point of its history: How to safeguard a 
democracy that has so dearly been conquered. We should admit 
that for some time now we have been witnessing a kind of auction 
situation in which each of us is intent on asserting himself by 
opposing one another. There is no one better than the office of 
Radiodiffusion-Television du Mali at assessing the extreme 
tension that currently prevails in our country and the clouds 
that are obscuring our democracy. 
  Several parties have noisily left the government. The 
majority ruling party says loudly and clearly that it will 
assume its responsibilities. Students and pupils are taking to 
the streets; the trade union federations are giving ultimatums; 
many of our colleagues of the private printed media seem to be 
more preoccupied by what they consider as the freedom of the 
press than the consequences of what they write when the country 
is in an explosive situation. Some radios are making calls for 
an insurrection. When one adds to all this the impact of the 
devaluation on the people, there is so much to be concerned 
about. We can but wonder how far the various sides will 
go--hopefully not to the point of destroying the family 
structure that is Mali. 
  In the face of the accumulation of dangerous situations, of 
this auction, we should call for restraint, caution, and 
reserve. It should be said that when one sets fire to the common 
house, one runs the risk of being burnt along with everything 
that is dear to you. We do (?hope) that the numerous democrats 
that are living in Mali, regardless of their political parties, 
will get ahold of themselves before it is too late and place 
Mali before all selfish political motives. 
  To be a democrat is not just a slogan, it is an attitude. 
The opportunity is offered today to all democrats to show who 
they are and, to do so, they must adopt a courageous attitude in 
the face of the dangers that are threatening us. They should, 
from now on, mold their attitude and make their statements in 
the sense of how to safeguard our Mali, how to ease the tension. 
The civil society--if it really exists--is being called upon to 
meet that challenge more than ever before. 
  We are proud to say that Mali is a country of ancient 
civilization and rich culture. We have been able to face all 
kinds of adversities at all times. We have always been able to 
stand tall and dignified during the most difficult times. It is 
certainly not today that history will prove us wrong. Sundiata, 
Ba Bemba, Samory, Dan Monzon, (Firum), the March 1991 Martyrs, 
all those who made the glorious history of Mali, shall never 
forgive us. One thing is certain: A failure today will be the 
failure of the democrats, all the democrats.

  [Text] Work was paralyzed today at the Treasury Department 
offices following the 48-hour strike called by a collective of 
the department's trade union. The trade union is demanding the 
payment of January salaries, which most civil servants received 
several days ago. Workers in the information department, 
lecturers in the National School of Administration, the staff of 
the agricultural research centers, university staff, those of 
the public works department, and the trade union of lecturers 
and researchers of the higher education sector say that 
government has not even bothered to open negotiations with their 
various trade unions. They denounce the discrimination in the 
payment of salaries and criticize the lack of interest 
demonstrated by the Federation of Labor Unions of Niger 
concerning the demands of the affiliated trade unions. 
Meanwhile, the strike continues with the government totally 
ignoring the demands of the workers.

  [Text] Lagos, Feb 8 (AFP) -- Nigeria's Campaign for 
Democracy (CD), grouping scores of human rights and student 
organisations, pledged its commitment Tuesday [8 February] to an 
"intensified struggle" to bring down the military regime. 
  The CD, which was in the forefront of a campaign last year 
for recognition of the results of June 12 civilian presidential 
elections annulled by the army, said it would work for "the 
immediate termination of the Abacha dictatorship." 
  In a statement released here after a national convention of 
the Campaign last week in Ibadan, north of Lagos, the movement 
"condemned in the strongest terms possible the unwanted and 
unwelcome coup of General Sani Abacha of November 17, 1993." 
Abacha ousted an unelected, short-lived civilian interregnum "at 
a time when what the majority of Nigerians desired was the 
upholding of the June 12 election adjuged the fairest and freest 
in the nation's history." 
  The CD convention called for the "immediate" setting up of a 
national government including "popular and credible 
representatives of various social, professional and ethnic 
groups" in Africa's most populous nation, which has some 89 
million inhabitants. 
  The CD, whose convention brought together 120 delegates from 
70 movements working for democracy, is essentially based in the 
Yoruba southwest of the country, the home base of the Moslem 
millionaire believed to have won the poll last June, Moshood 
Abiola. 
  Its statement "decried the slavish, easy and unprecedented 
capitulation of the political elite...to the Abacha regime," 
blaming members of both Abiola's left-leaning Social Democratic 
Party and the rival National Republican Convention. "This was 
demonstrated by their failure to resist the dissolution of all 
democratic structures," including the federal parliament and the 
two political parties themselves, by Abacha on his seizure of 
power, the CD said. 
  Politicians had nevertheless chosen "to embrace it (the 
regime) by grabbing appointments at the state and federal levels 
without regard to the aspirations of their (party) members and 
the socio-political destiny of Nigerians in general." On 
seizing power with a pledge eventually to restore civilian rule, 
Abacha managed to enlist a number of prominent Abiola supporters 
into his governing team. 
  The CD said the "main agenda" of the new government it 
wanted 
should be to prepare for a "Sovereign National Conference (SNC) 
that shall deliberate on all national issues it deems fit 
without any derogation or interference whatsoever by the 
government." The conference should devise a new "popular" 
transition programme to bring about a "genuinely democratic 
order through free and fair multiparty elections." 
  Then military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida annulled the 
June 12 poll alleging irregularities, though international 
observers had billed it a clean race, and plunged Nigeria into 
turmoil after its latest decade of military rule.

  [Text] Lagos, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Leaders of Nigeria's Ibo 
people have called for an end to military rule and the accession 
to power of the presumed winner of presidential elections 
annulled last year, press reports said Wednesday [9 February]. 
Recognition of the election results and the installation of 
millionaire Moshood Abiola, a Yoruba Moslem businessman, would 
remove the "cancer that will afflict the people of Nigeria for 
generations," the Ibo leaders said in a statement. 
  The June 12 election was annulled by then military ruler 
General Ibrahim Babangida on the grounds of irregularities, 
though international observers had called it free and fair. The 
eastern-based Ibos, together with the Hausa and the Yoruba, are 
the three main ethnic groups in Nigeria, Africa's most populous 
nation, with some 89 million people. 
  Plans by the current military regime of General Sani Abacha 
to hold a constitutional conference to chart the country's 
future should be scrapped in favor of a national conference, the 
Ibo leaders added. Members of the conference must be elected 
and their decisions should be final, they said. 
  The leaders also called Nigeria's very future into question. 
Nigerian unity had been maintained by force by the northern 
military class against the people of the" rest of the country, 
they said, adding that the merger of north with south in 1914 
under British colonial rule "was a monumental mistake or so it 
seems". The government has, however, warned that it will make 
no compromises on the issue of the continued existence of 
Nigeria as a entity during the conference scheduled to take 
place in the first quarter of the year. 
  Nigeria suffered a bloody civil war in the late 1960s after 
the Ibo Eastern State region of the time tried in vain to secede 
as independent Biafra, after a dispute over the distribution of 
oil revenues from the region.

  [Text] About 18,000 Nigerians have fled their homes on 
various islands in the Bakassi Peninsula in Akwa Ibom State of 
Nigeria following another invasion by Cameroonian gendarmes. 
The raided islands are Amamong, Ine Abasi, Utang Iyak, Onosi, 
Uberofim, Akpa Edok, Edem Abasi, Ekpai, and Akwa Isong. The 
NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA reports that some 4,000 refugees from the 
islands, attacked by the gendarmes in an earlier raid on January 
19, are now living in unhealthy and harsh weather conditions in 
Abana and Atabong fishing settlements. Some of the refugees, 
who accused the gendarmes of cold-blooded murder, said the 
latest attack was the worst in the history of the peninsula.

  [Text] Every Togolese now has an idea about the partial 
results of the first round of legislative elections in our 
country. Here is an update on the partial results by Kokou 
Tordjro: 
  [Tordjro] In this first round of the 1994 legislative 
elections, the results--which have yet to be confirmed after 
verification by the National Electoral Commission [CEN]--are as 
follows: 57 seats are provisionally occupied and 24 are in a 
tie. Remember that these results have not yet been confirmed by 
the CEN. According to our investigation, a breakdown of the 57 
seats that are provisionally occupied shows the following 
results: The Rally of the Togolese People [RPT] won 33 seats; 
the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], 19; the Togolese Union 
for Democracy [UTD], three; and the Union for Justice and 
Development, two. 
  Concerning the 24 seats in a tie, here is the breakdown: UTD 
and CAR tied in 12 constituencies, RPT and CAR in six, RPT and 
UTD in four, RPT and CFN [expansion unknown] in one, and PDC 
[expansion unknown] and CAR in one.

  [Text] Clashes between government troops and National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] rebels, which left 
more than 350 dead and 400 wounded over the past five days, have 
subsided since dawn today. Most of the victims were women, 
children, and elderly people. The men in the service of Jonas 
Savimbi have stopped shelling Cuito. A relative calm prevails, 
but this could be designed to deceive government troops. The 
operational command of the Angolan Armed Forces says UNITA's 
decision is to gain time and reorganize its forces in view of 
the defeats it has suffered. Brigadier (Filione Mukume), deputy 
commander of the government forces stationed in Cuito, says 
UNITA will be met with the appropriate response if it tries to 
gain the upper hand.

  [Text] International aid organizations in Angola have 
evacuated relief workers from the central highland city of Cuito 
during a lull in the latest fighting between government forces 
and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
rebels. The workers are for Medicins Sans Frontiers, Concern, 
and the International Red Cross. The government now says at 
least 200 people have been killed in Cuito in the past five 
days. UNITA had told news agencies it would declare a 
unilateral truce in the area. There has been no confirmation 
whether one is in force. Peace talks in the Zambian capital, 
Lusaka, which were adjourned last week to allow participants to 
attend the funeral of the late Ivorian leader Felix 
Houphouet-Boigny are expected to resume shortly. Both sides 
have said they do not expect the latest outbreak of fighting to 
have any effect on the negotiations.

  [Text] UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, who 
is also the principal mediator at the Lusaka peace talks, is 
scheduled to arrive in the Zambian capital today. The peace 
talks are expected to resume and focus on issues relating to 
national reconciliation. 
  During a brief stopover in Luanda yesterday, on his way back 
from Cote d'Ivoire, UN Special Representative Blondin Beye 
expressed, as ever, hope in the future of the Lusaka peace 
talks. After condemning the resumption by the Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, of the 
fighting in the Central Plateau region, Blondin Beye urged the 
international community not to allow the Angolan peace process 
to derail. 
  Speaking to the MPLA-PT media, Blondin Beye said he had met 
a 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team 
led by UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola during his 
stay in Cote d'Ivoire. That UN official added he and the UNITA 
team had discussed the Angolan peace process. He also had talks 
with other international figures concerning the Angolan problem.

  [Text] Good evening. Blondin Beye arrived today and went 
to work. First, he met with the observers to take stock of the 
situation. Afterward, he met with the government negotiating 
team. Blondin Beye informed the delegations of his visit to Cote 
d'Ivoire--namely, the meetings with several politicians, 
including George Moose, U.S. under secretary of state for 
African affairs. Blondin Beye also met with Angolan Government 
officials. He also met with Jorge Valentim, the only National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiator 
present in Lusaka. The main body of UNITA negotiators has not 
yet arrived, but reports say they could return to Lusaka at any 
time. Analysts say the talks will remain deadlocked as long as 
the UNITA delegation is not in Lusaka. Paradoxically, Blondin 
Beye is set for a meeting with the UNITA negotiating team 
tomorrow at 1000.

  [Text] The United States has sent an ultimatum [as heard] 
to the two warring parties in the Angolan conflict, and both 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] and 
the MPLA [People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola] have 
already responded with a yes sir to Uncle Sam. The Black 
Cockerel [UNITA] has actually congratulated the United States 
through the voice of its spokesman Jorge Valentim who said that 
the important thing is to bring the war to an end: 
  [Begin Valentim recording] We in UNITA have always wanted 
the 
United States to take this attitude. We congratulate the White 
House, the U.S. Administration. It is high time the war was 
made to stop at once. We congratulate President Clinton. [end 
recording] 
  The Luanda government also agrees with Clinton but wants 
more 
international pressure on UNITA, as [presidential spokesman] 
Aldomiro da Conceicao has told us: 
  [Begin da Conceicao recording] The presidency of the 
Republic 
of Angola has welcomed with satisfaction the view expressed by 
the United States on the question of the recrudescence of the 
war in Angola. However, we take the view that greater pressure 
should be exerted on UNITA to lead it to show real willingness 
to bring this conflict to an end. [end recording] 
  The United States says that either there is an end to the 
hostilities in Angola or the Lusaka peace negotiations will be 
cut short.

  [Excerpts] The Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] met 
in Maputo yesterday. The meeting seems to have found the need 
to quickly and definitely resolve the dispute existing between 
the government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] 
regarding the Salamanga area in southern Mozambique. The CSC 
decided that the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], which 
occupied Salamanga after signing the General Peace Accord, 
should withdraw 30 km away from the area. Renamo has not yet 
withdrawn from the area. What is more, Renamo men and war 
materiel have begun arriving in the area, apparently to use it 
as an assembly area. 
  In a statement to the press at the end of yesterday's 
meeting, Minister Armando Guebuza, head of the government 
delegation to the CSC, gave the impression that the government 
is losing its patience. The dispute still continues, and Renamo 
seems to be usingng out one delaying tactic after another in 
order not to withdraw from the area. 
  [Begin Guebuza recording] The CSC decided that Renamo should 
withdraw 10 to 30 km away from Salamanga. Renamo appealed, but 
the CSC upheld its decision. It appealed again, and we continue 
to have meeting after meeting to examine an issue that has 
already been decided upon by the bodies established by the 
government and Renamo. The decision was made in the presence of 
the government and Renamo. The government and Renamo have the 
power to vote against a CSC decision, but Renamo did not do so. 
Now it is questioning the decision. [passage omitted] [end 
recording] 
  Asked to comment on the issue, Renamo's Jose de Castro tried 
to minimize the problem. 
  [Begin de Castro recording] Well, I think this issue has 
already been well explained [words indistinct] we withdrew first 
to avoid dispute. In view of logistical conditions in the area, 
Renamo wrote to the CSC, requesting to confine its forces there. 
This is well known. However, the government does not want us to 
be where we are. They want us 10 km away. We see the government 
coming up with a problem that does not exist. Assembly areas 
are provisional areas. After a while, some soldiers will join 
the future army and others will be demobilized. Accordingly, I 
do not see any reason for the government to object. [end 
recording] 
  Meanwhile, Aldo Ajello, representative of the UN secretary 
general in Mozambique, promised to take an initiative on 12 
February to once and for all resolve the problem. 
  Yesterday's CSC meeting examined many other issues, 
including 
the confinement of government and Renamo forces, the training of 
the new Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, the demobilization of 
troops from both sides, and the need to begin to transport to 
regional depots all weapons handed at assembly areas.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Cardoso] </F>
  [Excerpts] (Maputo) UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello 
is of the opinion that the Salamanga issue is becoming a "trap." 
  Ajello told MEDIAFAX yesterday that "right now, it is just a 
matter of prestige for the two sides (the government and the 
Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo)." "This issue has 
become a matter of principle and that should have been avoided." 
  We approached Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana for an 
opinion, 
after apprising him of Ajello's views. 
  Hunguana replied that Ajello's reading of the problem 
revealed "naivete, to say the least." 
  Hunguana asked: "Why is it that Renamo defies decisions made 
by the competent organs? What is the real reason?" 
  To the labor minister, the most recent pronouncements by 
Dhlakama and Ngonhamo are at variance with the logic of the 
peace process, leading to speculation that Renamo has a hidden 
agenda that includes the use of force. 
  Does the goverment take a military view of Renamo's 
insistence on maintaining its military position in Salamanga? 
  "Such an interpretation cannot be excluded", Hunguana 
replied. [passage omitted] 
  This is Renamo's Jose de Castro's version of the events: 
Renamo agreed to leave the relevant farming area in Salamanga 
and move 700 meters away from it "to avoid controversy", but the 
government wants Renamo to shift its men to at least 10 km from 
it. Castro told MEDIAFAX that Renamo asked for that area for 
logistical reasons, adding that it offers good conditions for an 
assembly area. He confirmed that, at a meeting of the 
Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, Renamo had conveyed its 
belief that the government wanted Renamo out of the farming area 
because it had been given to Transport and Communications 
Minister Armando Guebuza. 
  Ajello announced publicly on 8 February that he would launch 
"an initiative" to settle the problem. 
  We asked him: What initiative? To which he simply replied 
that it would be an initiative "outside the usual channels" to 
"get us out of this trap." Ajello believes that there will be 
no logistical problems for the UN Operations in Mozambique, 
should it need to move the Renamo forces to one of two assembly 
areas--one 10 km and the other 30 km from the disputed area. 
  Other than that, Ajello believes the process is going 
satisfactorily. To the extent that elections may be held in 
October? "We must have elections in October", he categorically 
replied, adding: "We have no other choice." 
  Not even a smaller UN budget for, let us say, another six 
months, until April 1995? 
  "No, elections must be held in October." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mateus Ngonhamo of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] has once again accused the UN system in 
Mozambique, especially Aldo Ajello, of being particularly 
critical of that movement and benevolent to the Mozambican 
Government. Ngonhamo says that could become a bad precedent for 
the country's pacification process. 
  [Begin Ngonhamo recording] We are worried about the UN 
conduct, because the organization is only concerned with the 
minor issues but ignores major ones. UN partiality is creating 
difficulties for us. Ever since the UN mission arrived in 
Mozambique it has never accused the government, except once when 
Mr. Aldo Ajello said he would draft a document informing the UN 
Security Council that the government was not complying with the 
confinement program. That was the only time. This is a very 
dangerous situation. 
  Personally, I think if one day war breaks out in Mozambique 
again, the UN elements, notably Mr. Aldo Ajello, will be the 
guilty party. He is here to assist Mozambicans holding on to 
peace. Instead of letting people hold onto peace, he encourages 
them to do otherwise. That is very dangerous for the Mozambican 
people. I regret this situation. I think the United Nations 
and Dr. Ajello, in his capacity as chief of the UN Operations in 
Mozambique, should review their modus operandi. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Fumo leader Domingos Arouca by Fernando </F>
Manuel; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Manuel] How do you describe your recent visit to 
Europe, and how do you assess its outcome? 
  [Arouca] My visit to Europe began in Rome, where I was 
received by his holiness the pope in a joint audience and with 
the treatment accorded to heads of state. I was very impressed 
with the treatment that the Vatican accorded to my wife and me. 
We had a brief exchange of views. I sent photographs of the 
meeting to the Mozambican press, but they were not published. 
That was true sabotage. In instances where the photographs 
were published, they were so small one could hardly see them. 
It is regrettable that local journalists should act like this. 
  The audience at the Vatican had been arranged two weeks in 
advance through the regular channels. Everything went according 
to legal procedures. In Rome, I also met a number of 
politicians with whom I exchanged views. I saw to it that 
protocols of cooperation were signed between Fumo [Mozambique 
United Front-Democratic Convergence Party] and those parties. 
Fumo succeeded in doing that. Right now we are in contact with 
those parties, and the indications are that such contacts will 
continue. 
  In Bonn, I visited the Konrad Adenauer and Friedrich Ebert 
Foundations. We have succeeded in establishing positive 
relations with those foundations. 
  In Lisbon, I met with the Christian Democratic Party. I 
think this is the only party that is in contact with UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. The 
other Portuguese parties have adopted a leftist stance and enjoy 
very strong relations with Angola's MPLA [Popular Movement for 
the Liberation of Angola] and Mozambique's Frelimo [Mozambique 
Liberation Front]. I did not try to establish contacts with 
those parties. I have tried to do so in the past, but to no 
avail. In fact, the only party that has maintained relations 
with non-Marxist parties from the former colonies is the 
Christian Democratic Party. 
  By the way, some time ago, in an article signed by J.M., 
DOMINGO said I had been a CDS [Social Democratic Center] 
militant. I must point out that I have never been a militant in 
any Portuguese party. Actually, the Portuguese know that I have 
been the Fumo leader since 1976. After all, no citizen may 
belong to two parties at the same time. It would be wrong for 
me to be the leader of one party and a militant in another. The 
insinuation appeared in that newspaper, and I think it was 
shrouded in a certain degree of malice. In any event, 
ill-intentioned deeds stay with those who practice them and not 
with those at whom they are leveled. 
  Going back to the visit, I must tell you that I do not wish 
to go into further details to prevent sabotage and a blockade by 
certain adversaries. 
  [Manuel] You have often been referred to as the Catholic 
Church's ticket in the upcoming elections. This has to do with 
your meeting with the pope and your frequent contacts with 
[Mozambican Cardinal] Dom Alexandre. What are your comments? 
  [Arouca] This was my first contact with the pope, and I do 
not know if there will be others. As for Dom Alexandre, my 
contacts with him date back more than 30 years, when he was a 
mere village priest in Jangamo, in the outlaying areas of 
Inhambane. Afterward, he served as a priest in Homoine, where I 
think he was born.... When I was studying in Portugal, I used to 
come to Mozambique on vacation, and usually I met with him and 
talked to him. He is rather close to my family and knows my 
parents and all my relatives. That cemented our friendship at a 
time when none of us dreamed that he would become a cardinal. 
  I did not see him while I was in exile in Portugal, but we 
resumed our contacts after I returned. My contacts with him are 
not political at all--far from it. I do not expect to be backed 
by the church as a candidate for the simple reason that, as a 
jurist, I am supposed to know that canonical law prohibits the 
involvement of the church in political schemes. Aware of that 
reality, I have nurtured neither the will, desire, ambition, nor 
whim of becoming a candidate backed by the church. The church 
cannot meddle in politics, and I uphold that centuries-old 
principle, which is part and parcel of the basic laws of that 
institution. 
  I maintain relations with many bishops in Mozambique, but 
these are purely relations of friendship. I am a believer and 
was brought up to following the austere principles of religion. 
My entire family is Christian. The claim that I might become 
the church's candidate is not true. 
  [Manuel] Elections are scheduled to take place in about nine 
months. How does Fumo envisage its electoral strategy? 
  [Arouca] Right now, we are formulating our strategy. For 
obvious reasons, I cannot give you the details. We have, 
however, made a great deal of progress in this regard, more than 
in other areas. We regret that the process is marred by so many 
disturbances, discrepancies, and setbacks. Yet, I think that 
this is the price we ought to pay for the establishment of 
democracy in Mozambique. 
  Will the process evolve normally? I think that it will, 
although there are signs looming on the political horizon that 
there could be serious political disturbances. In any event, 
there is a great deal of goodwill for the process to move 
forward quickly and clearly. I think the Mozambican people will 
do their best so that the process is neither halted nor 
disrupted. 
  We are following it with attention and will do our best to 
see that what has happened and is happening in Angola does not 
take place in Mozambique. I am optimistic. 
  [Manuel] There seems to be a great deal of polarization 
about 
Frelimo and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance], with each 
claiming to be the champions of democracy. What role will the 
unarmed opposition parties play? 
  [Arouca] Frelimo and Renamo have not started democracy in 
Mozambique, unless one thinks that those who ruined the country, 
carried out destruction, and caused 1 million deaths and 4 
million refugees have established democracy.... It is the 
people who started democracy. 
  I have read in several newspapers that Dhlakama and Chissano 
are natural candidates. This implies that all the others are 
unnatural candidates. How this can be natural is something that 
is beyond my comprehension. Are natural candidates those who 
waged war, ordered massacres, and ruined the country's 
infrastructures and unnatural candidates the ones who stood for 
democracy through dialogue? I do not quite understand that. 
  The unarmed parties have a very important role to play in 
this political process. What needs to be known is whether we 
will be able to play that role efficiently in these 
circumstances. If there are no major splits among the unarmed 
parties and if there is a balanced understanding between the 
opposition and the powers that be, I think the unarmed parties 
could play a decisive role. 
  Right now, I am in touch with some of the political leaders, 
specifically to encourage them to understand that unity is 
fundamental for the opposition to win. One must always bear the 
following in mind: If, for some reason, Frelimo wins the next 
elections, it would be very difficult to remove it from power. 
The opposition's main opportunity to achieve this is during the 
first elections, not during succeeding elections. 
  [Manuel] Are you suggesting that the opposition should form 
a 
coalition? 
  [Arouca] I do not know whether it will be a coalition, a 
unity, or a front. As I see it, the opposition ought to have a 
strategy that is as unified as possible if it wants to win the 
elections. If the opposition remains divided, none of the 
parties will go very far. 
  [Manuel] And have your calls been welcomed by those leaders? 
  [Arouca] Well, the parties that I have spoken to have been 
receptive and understanding. In fact, I expect my contacts will 
result in the establishment of a force capable of winning the 
elections, and that is very important for this country. 
  [Manuel] As far as I know, your political career is quite a 
long one. How do you see yourself as a candidate for the 
Presidency of the Republic in the upcoming elections? 
  [Arouca] In January 1993, Fumo held its first national 
congress. During this congress, it was decided that I would be 
the natural candidate to run in the first democratic elections. 
I accepted that decision with a degree of satisfaction, and I 
have made arrangements to play that role in a positive manner. 
Yet, contrary to what some people may think, I have no ambition 
or personal interest in becoming president of the Republic. 
Throughout my life, I have been invited to play senior roles, 
both by the Portuguese Government during the colonial era and by 
Frelimo after independence. 
  I refused to collaborate with Portugal because I did not 
want 
to side with colonialism. I refused to work with Frelimo 
because I did not want to throw in my lot with the establishment 
of communism in my fatherland. 
  In view of this, I could ask: So, why am I running for the 
post now? I have accepted it for a number of reasons. I can 
explain some of them. First, I have been in politics for some 
40 years and a lawyer for about 30 years. That has given me 
some political, administrative, and juridical experience. I 
clearly understand that it is my duty to serve the country. All 
of us are not enough to tackle the task of reconstruction. 
  Moreover, it is my view that people may only conscientiously 
exercise their right to vote if there are at least three or four 
candidates for the presidency. At least one of them should be a 
civilian who was not involved in the war or responsible for the 
situation the country faces today. Only this will permit the 
people to choose their candidate. To say that the candidates 
are Chissano and Dhlakama is to force one to choose a soldier. 
I reject that. It is not democracy. The people have the right 
to choose between soldiers and civilians, but not between two 
soldiers. 
  This is one of the reasons why my candidacy will be 
announced. It does not matter whether I am elected. What 
matters is that the people may clearly and conscientiously make 
a choice. 
  Another reason for my decision is that I think this country 
is like a train that has derailed into a swamp of corruption and 
stagnation. If I am elected, my priority will be to put the 
train back on track, to head it in the right direction, and to 
put it into motion. Later, power will be handed over to the 
younger generation because I feel that it is the country's young 
people who should lead the nation. 
  Another reason is that after I saw the direction in which 
Frelimo's reforms were heading and the manner in which the 
Frelimo government operated, I realized that no significant 
change can take place in this country as long as Frelimo remains 
in power. 
  The priority for the opposition is to remove Frelimo from 
power. These are some of the reasons. Personally, I think that 
being president of the Republic is a sacrifice, although one 
that every citizen ought to endure for the sake of his 
fatherland. Only people without occupations or professions 
yearn to be president. 
  [Manuel] It has become quite clear that the ability of 
governments to rule in a country like ours is declining in favor 
of international financial institutions like the IMF and the 
World Bank. How do you think you would fulfill your program 
under such conditions? 
  [Arouca] These institutions have not parachuted into the 
country. They entered the country because the Frelimo 
government created so much poverty and misery that it became 
necessary for the IMF and the World Bank to come here. If the 
Frelimo government had worked differently, it would not be in 
such a tight situation today. 
  The way out of this? I am not the one to tell you. Frelimo 
has its own experts, and it should solve its own problems. 
  [Manuel] It seems that Fumo has not been able to escape the 
tradition of crisis that is the hallmark of opposition parties. 
Recently, the removal of its vice president was announced. How 
do you assess the situation in your party? 
  [Arouca] Dr. Carlos Jeque has not been removed. He resigned 
for personal reasons, and these need to be resolved. I think he 
felt he could not give his best to the party because of those 
reasons. He has not been removed from the party, and there is no 
crisis whatsoever. He merely ceased to be the vice president, a 
very demanding post. 
  [Manuel] Your name has been cited as being linked to a 
project for the creation of a democratic institute in 
Mozambique. What are your comments? 
  [Arouca] I have such a plan. I embarked on it because, nine 
months before the elections, there are areas in the country 
where people do not even know that a multiparty system is in 
place. They still think that we live in a single-party system. 
  As a government, Frelimo should shoulder the responsibility 
of effectively educating the people. Frelimo does not do it 
because it is not interested. What matters for Frelimo is that 
people continue to think that only Frelimo exists and that it 
might even be dangerous to vote for another party. 
  I think there should be a nonpartisan body so that parties 
may join hands, organize teams, meet the rural population, and 
tell them that the situation has changed, how it has changed, 
and what their rights are. I think this is fundamental and 
urgent. 
  [Manuel] In recent statements to MEDIAFAX, the Renamo leader 
accused you of serious violations, embezzling his movement's 
funds, and so on. You have never commented on this publicly. 
Why? 
  [Arouca] I have never commented on it because these 
accusations are not worth commenting on. These accusations 
should not only be made; they should be proved, as well. When 
the Renamo leader produces evidence of what he is saying, you 
may rest assured that I will then refute it because what he said 
has never taken place. He has probably ignored what has 
happened. He ignored the fact that I was invited to lead Renamo 
when it was still called MNR [Mozambique National Resistance] 
and before he was around. I turned down the invitation. First 
of all, I am against war, and Renamo always had a militaristic 
outlook. I think that problems between Mozambicans should be 
resolved through frank and loyal dialogue, not through arms. We 
all know how to start wars, but no one knows how they will end. 
  Second, Renamo was created a year after I established Fumo, 
a 
party more in line with my political philosophy. General 
Dhlakama probably ignores that. He ignores the history of his 
own party. He should be better informed. Dhlakama has the bad 
habit of making wild statements against everybody without 
proving what he says. That is not suitable for a candidate for 
the presidency of the Republic. This strange attitude is 
gradually disqualifying him. 
  He is well aware of the accident that claimed the life of 
former Ambassador Ataide--who was accompanied by Mateus--who was 
known as Dhlakama's personal representative in Europe. He 
knows, like I do, how they died and where they died, although 
their bodies have never been found. It would be better if 
Dhlakama abstains from talking about things about which he does 
not seem to be well informed. 
  In one of his interviews, Dhlakama said I was rather old. 
That is true, and I am only honored by that statement. It 
gives greater legitimacy to my candidacy. I think candidates 
ought to be somewhat old to be perceived as honest. I would 
like to remind him that Nelson Mandela, leader of the ANC 
[African National Congress], is 72; UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali is 72; and, if I am not mistaken, Dr. Mario Soares, 
president of the Portuguese Republic, today regarded as one of 
Europe's most brilliant statesmen and already mentioned as the 
successor to Butrus-Ghali, is also about 72. They are all much 
older than I. Nobody has said that Mandela, Butrus-Ghali, or 
Mario Soares are too old to perform their duties efficiently. 
  This only shows that the older people are, the more mature, 
experienced, and useful they become. In fact, power should be 
exercised by experienced people with suitable academic 
qualifications and not by adventurers.

  [Text] An ANC [African National Congress]-led government 
would wrest mineral rights from mining houses and place them in 
the hands of the State, ANC president Nelson Mandela stated 
openly yesterday. 
  South Africa's minerals belonged to the State and mining 
companies should lease the right to exploit these and pay 
consideration to the State, he told mineworkers on the last day 
of the National Union of Mineworkers' national congress in 
Pretoria. The people would own the mineral rights, with the 
State acting as a custodian, he said. 
  This idea was first mooted by the ANC in its Reconstruction 
and Development Programme recently, and was met with widespread 
concern. The gold index plunged 98 points, to 2060, in one 
trading session, but recovered following Mandela's statement 
that the initial announcement was "unfortunate." 
  He seems to have come full circle in response to changes in 
legislation which became effective this year. Mandela accused 
the Government of transferring ownership of mineral rights to 
mining houses once aware that a new order would replace them. 
  "This was a conspiracy between mining houses and the NP 
[National Party]. But we will not allow that to happen. A 
democratic government will change every agreement between the NP 
and the mining houses." And the right to mine should not be 
exclusive to mining houses but should be extended to 
individuals, he added. 
  In a wide-ranging speech, Mandela said an ANC government 
would honour the right of workers to unionise and strike. "It 
will be the first duty of an ANC government. The right to 
strike is a democratic right of workers through the country," he 
said. 
  In a stinging attack on the NP, Mandela said the party did 
not have a conception of how to serve all South Africans. "They 
don't know what it is to serve everyone." 
  Mandela paid tribute to the police, from the upper echelons 
to the Internal Stability Unit, especially in Natal. "We have 
men and women who are committed to the building of a new South 
Africa. Their problem is politicians who do dishonourable 
things."

  [Text] African National Congress leader Mr. Nelson Mandela 
says he is still prepared to negotiate with right-wing 
Afrikaners about their fears, but there will never be a homeland 
-- not because the ANC is unsympathetic to the feelings of the 
right wing, but because the organization is opposed to such an 
idea in principle. 
  Mr. Mandela was speaking today at the eighth national 
congress of the National Union of Mineworkers in Pretoria. He 
said the ANC is not prepared to conduct discussions under 
pressure from threats of violence. 
  [Begin Mandela recording in English] It is our task to 
address the concerns of all our people, even those who regard us 
as enemies. We are, therefore, prepared to sit down with the 
leadership of the right wing in order to address these problems. 
Our main problem is that the right wing really does not 
understand the implications of their demands. If they come out 
with a proposal which ensures that there will be movement 
forward, we are still prepared to sit down with them. But we 
are not going to continue for years discussing the same things 
which we discussed last year. [end recording]

  [Text] The leader of the ANC [African National Congress], 
Mr. Nelson Mandela, has accused the National Party [NP] of using 
elements in the security forces to sow chaos in the country. 
Speaking at the annual congress of the National Union of 
Mineworkers in Pretoria, Mr. Mandela said the NP had used the 
security forces to ensure that SWAPO [South-West African 
People's Organization] did not get a two-thirds majority in the 
Namibian election. He said the two batallions used then were 
now being used to create chaos in South Africa.

  [Text] Government negotiator Roelf Meyer says the Freedom 
Alliance is not really interested in a negotiated constitutional 
settlement. His comment follows last night's announcement by 
the Freedom Alliance that it won't make any more concessions in 
negotiations with the ANC [African National Congress] and the 
government. Mr. Meyer told television news that the alliance 
had communicated to him today to facilitate further discussions, 
but its inflexibility might make a settlement impossible. 
  [Begin Meyer recording] It's a question of how do you 
negotiate. Do you negotiate to ensure a settlement at the end 
which provides a win-win situation, or do you want a win-lose 
situation? I'm afraid that is not attainable under these 
circumstances, and in the end I believe what we need to get 
clarity on from the Freedom Alliance is whether they are, in 
fact, wanting a solution that could lead to an inclusive 
settlement. [end recording]

  [Text] Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer says 
recent demands made by King Goodwill Zwelithini of the Zulus are 
tantamount to a call for independence. Mr. Meyer told the SABC 
[South African Broadcasting Corporation] that the king's 
delegation had made specific demands about the future of the 
kwaZulu kingdom during talks with President F.W. de Klerk. He 
would not divulge the details but said it was a cause for 
concern as the matter could redirect the future of the

  [Text] Chaos broke out at a meeting addressed by 
Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer in Lenasia last 
night when ANC [African National Congress] and NP [National 
Party] supporters tried to drown each other out. Outside the 
hall Azapo [Azanian People's Organization] supporters shouted 
slogans and displayed placards that made no bones about their 
feeling for Mr. Meyer. 
  During his speech, which was interrupted continually by 
hecklers and supporters, Mr. Meyer referred to the Freedom 
Alliance's [FA] refusal to compromise at talks with the 
government and the ANC. He said that if the FA decided to 
boycott the election, other parties would look after the 
interests of its supporters. 
  [Begin Meyer recording] Those parties in the Freedom 
Alliance 
are not going to participate in the election. Then we can 
ensure their supporters also from the National Party side that 
we will also take care of their interests. [end recording]

  [Text] The Port Elizabeth branch of the Azanian Students' 
Movement [Azasm] says it will increase efforts to remove all 
white teachers from schools in the townships. At a media 
conference today the students' movement said that it would use 
violence if other means failed. Mike Proctor-Sims reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Proctor-Sims] Port Elizabeth township 
schools have been the most affected by Azasm's campaign, 
possibly because Azasm's national president, Phumzile Msutu, 
lives here. Mr. Msutu claimed this week's removal of white 
principal Chris de Wet from the (Tilulwazi) Secondary School in 
Zwide as a victory for affirmative action and Azasm. 
  A visit to the school by television news today showed 
another 
story. Teachers, both black and white, had downed chalk, and 
pupils had gone home early. About 1.5 percent of the 12,000 
teachers at Department of Education and Training-run schools in 
the region are white. Fifteen of the white teachers teach at 
Khwezi Lomso in Zwide. This school had a 62.6 percent matric 
pass rate last year, more than 25 percent better than the 
average in the second worst year ever. Parents have demanded 
their retention. Headmasters and teachers at black schools 
would not talk on camera today, fearing for their careers and 
lives. The majority of township residents seem against the 
indiscriminate removal of white teachers. 
  [Unidentified parent] I would like them to be there, because 
at the end of the day it is how my child is best equipped at 
high school, so that child will be able to stand a chance when 
it comes to university. 
  [Unidentified student] We don't believe in the removal of 
white teachers. We believe in a nonracial struggle, and we want 
the expertise of those teachers. [end recording]

  [Text] The Azanian Students' Movement [Azasm] says it will 
continue with its campaign to force white teachers out of 
township schools, but that this will now proceed in a structured 
manner. At a meeting between Azapo [Azanian People's 
Organization], Azasm, and the National Education Coordinating 
Committee in Cape Town it was agreed to set up a committee to 
collect data on white teachers in black schools. A summit 
meeting will also be convened to investigate the findings and to 
discuss the way forward. An Azasm spokesman said the committee 
should meet within the next month. Azasm denied that the 
campaign was racist and described it as an attempt to get jobs 
for unemployed black teachers.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Call for Removal of Exchange Controls--"Ahead of the 
election, insecurities are far more likely to grow than to 
recede, and that is likely to persist unless absolutely clear 
policies are specified by our next government," warns a page-10 
editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 10 
February. "The confidence needed if we are to attract the 
investment to create jobs and develop the economy would be 
restored more easily if a new government shows it has shed the 
fears that hobbled our economy under the National Party." 
BUSINESS DAY urges an "immediate removal of exchange controls." 
Argentinians and Egyptians that took the exchange controls leap 
of faith "have responded by redirecting their foreign funds back 
home." "South Africans seeking security have exported more than 
their capital, more than fistsfull of Krugerrands. Many have 
taken themselves and their skills abroad and are probably 
congratulating themselves on their foresight as this country 
descends into apparent confusion. A clear commitment on a 
timetable for removing exchange controls would be among the 
soundest confidence-boosters the ANC could provide." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Need for More Accessible Education -- A new government 
should 
"increase subsidies for tertiary institutions" advises 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 10 February. "The country 
will suffer if the state does not embark on an aggressive 
programme to make education more accessible." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  Campaign To Drive White Teachers From Black Schools -- "The 
campaign to drive white teachers out of traditionally black 
schools has graduated from being sadly misguided to decidedly 
dangerous," points out a page-6 editorial in Cape Town CAPE 
TIMES in English on 8 February. "Given the shambles in black 
education in South Africa, urgent efforts are clearly needed to 
train, retrain and upgrade the skills of black teachers. 
Efforts to demonise whites and run them out of town may pander 
to the racist instincts of some politicians, but they will not 
help black schoolchildren pass their exams."

  [Text] [Announcer] In Burundi, the 13 experts of the 
international inquiry commission yesterday published their 
preliminary observations on the massacres that took place after 
the aborted coup on 21 October. These experts, which were 
appointed by a consortium of nongovernmental organizations, say 
that between 25,000 and 50,000 people were killed. This is a 
frightful figure, although it is smaller than what had initially 
been announced -- a few weeks after the aborted coup, some 
observers said hundreds of thousands had been killed. The 
massacres took place in the wake of the aborted coup by the 
army. Philippe Retiens [not further identified] spoke to 
Monique Mas: 
  [Begin recording] [Retiens] The coup was seemingly carried 
out by the majority of army officers. That is to say, the Army 
was responsible, actively or passively, for the coup, contrary 
to what sources close to the Burundian Army said. They held 
that a few specific units were responsible. 
  [Mas] Who is behind the massacres that followed the aborted 
coup? 
  [Retiens] The responsibility is shared. Hutus killed Tutsis 
in reprisals. Especially when the news of the death of 
President Ndadaye was announced, many Tutsis were killed. 
Moreover, massacres were carried out by the Army, sometimes 
with the help of Tutsi civilians. 
  [Retiens] What is the situation in the country today? 
  [Mas] It remains quite unstable, especially in Bujumbura. 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] The international inquiry commission's final 
report will be published by April.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The quarrel between Nigeria and Cameroon over a 
disputed border area shows no signs of being resolved. Late 
last year, there were claims that Cameroon gendarmes were 
raiding villages in Nigerian territory. Then, Nigerian troops 
moved onto islands on the peninsula, ostensibly to protect 
Nigerian nationals living there. Now, the NIGERIAN NEWS AGENCY 
[NAN] says some 18,000 Nigerians have fled the area after raids 
by Cameroon gendarmes. And it seems a visit to Cameroon by 
Nigerian Foreign Minister Babagana Kingibe has not achieved very 
much. On the line to Yaounde, Raggi Omar asked Cameroon's 
minister of external affairs delegate, Francis Nkwain, if 
gendarmes had raided the disputed region. 
  [Begin recording] [Nkwain] First of all, the content of the 
news is absolutely wrong. We are not pursuing anybody and if we 
were in a war situation, then it should be the military. The 
gendarmes are not the people who go to war on behalf of our 
nation. So, that must be somebody who is writing who doesn't 
even know what is happening in Cameroon. Secondly, the 
peninsula has always been controversial on the part of Nigeria, 
but the peninsula is Cameroon. We didn't fight a war with 
Nigeria to gain any land, no. We got the land from history. 
When the colonial power left, we took over. And the maps are 
there, there is no question about it. 
  [Omar] So, you are completely refuting these reports on the 
NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA that thousands of Nigerians in this area 
are fleeing? 
  [Nkwain] We refute them because it is impossible even for 
that to be the news. 
  [Omar] But are people on the move in that region, can you 
confirm that? 
  [Nkwain] We can confirm that the island--I mean, the 
peninsula--has been occupied by Nigerian troops since 30 
December 1993 to 4 January 1994 and that the foreign minister of 
Nigeria came on the heels of our complaints and was received 
here by our head of state; and that our head of state sent the 
minister of external relations of Cameroon, who went to see 
President Abacha on the same issue; and that we all agreed that 
we were going to go down to the place to see whether or not the 
Nigerians had occupied the place or not; and we met today 
according to plan, and the foreign minister of Nigeria wouldn't 
let us go there. 
  [Omar] So, let me get this straight: You met the Nigerian 
foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, today to go and see this 
area but he refused to go? 
  [Ekwain] The minister of external relations of Cameroon, Mr. 
Oyono, was in Bouya, has been in Bouya since yesterday, where 
they met. And they were meeting there to proceed to the area to 
prove whether the place.... [pauses] The question was whether it 
was occupied or not. We are also aware that the Nigerian press 
has totally come out with funny stories in order to rationalize 
their action. That, we think, is their effort to prove to the 
world.... [pauses] That also proves to us that maybe they know 
they did something wrong. We are a small nation, you know. 
Nigeria is a big nation. 
  [Omar] Have your meetings with the Nigerian foreign 
minister, Babagana Kingibe, achieved anything at all? 
  [Ekwain] I say we have not because we were to meet to join 
forces and go down on to the territory, but he wouldn't let us 
go there now, so I am waiting for the minister to come back and 
then we will know the details of what happened thereafter. Now, 
if in the meanwhile, they mount another campaign through their 
media, it is not our problem to say horrible things about 
Cameroon. [end recording]

  [Begin Magnaga recording] Trusting to our people's wisdom

  [Text] The curfew and the state of alert have been lifted 
in Gabon. The measures were introduced after the 5 December 
presidential elections. The lifting of these measures has, 
nevertheless, been accompanied by a warning to all 
trouble-makers. Gabonese Defense Minister Martin-Fidele Magnaga 
explained the decision to Assane Diop: 
  [Being recording] [Magnaga] We saw that public order had 
been preserved. The protection of people and property was 
guaranteed. I would like to remind you that the curfew was 
introduced just after the elections, after the publication of 
the results of the presidential elections, because there was a 
serious threat of unrest, of violence, of the country spiralling 
into civil war. 
  [Diop] Your announcement today was, nevertheless, 
accompanied 
by a warning to those threatening public order. Is this mainly 
addressed to the political parties who had contested the 
validity of the election results? 
  [Magnaga] No, we issued this warning because we wanted, 
above 
all, to preserve peace in our country, to protect our citizens.

  [Text] An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 hijacked yesterday 
by two Ethiopians while on domestic flight from Bahir Dar to 
Addis Ababa and forced to land in Djibouti, returned to Addis 
Ababa yesterday evening, Ethiopian Airlines reported today. The 
airline noted that the hijacked aircraft with 115 passengers and 
eight crew members on board was forced to fly to Djibouti 
because the hijackers ordered the pilot to refuel the plane in 
Djibouti before proceeding to Sanaa. However, the Djibouti 
authorities refused to refuel the aircraft. After lengthy 
negotiations, the aircraft and its passengers returned yesterday 
at 2230 and the hijackers remained in Djibouti. The airline 
gave no details of how the aircraft was hijacked or the fate of 
the hijackers.

  [Text] Ethiopia has demanded that one of its former 
presidents, Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam, be extradited from 
Zimbabwe where he took exile after fleeing his country in 1991. 
This comes after Colonel Mengistu's recent (?statements) to the 
Zimbabwean press, criticizing the Ethiopian Government. 
Ethiopia's Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr. (Santahun H. Michael) 
said the former leader's continued presence in Zimbabwe would 
affect relations between the two countries. Mr. Mengistu's 
statements contravene his conditions of exile, which forbid 
comment on political developments in Ethiopia.

  [Text] Two British MPs have been kidnapped in Somalia, the 
Foreign Office said today. 
  Mark Robinson, Tory MP for Somerton and Frome, and Tony 
Worthington, Labour MP for Clydebank and Milngavie, were taken 
hostage along with an Action Aid employee. 
  The Action Aid employee is believed to be Jeff Chinnock. 
They were taken in North-West Somalia near a place called 
Erigavo some time last night. 
  A spokeswoman at Worthington's office told REUTERS: "I can 
confirm the reports. We have heard this morning that Tony is 
well." She said the two were on a fact-finding tour of Somalia 
with the charity Action Aid. "I believe they were kidnapped 
yesterday. We do not know who is holding them," she said. 
  The Foreign Office spokesman said he believed an Action Aid 
employee "was also involved" but could give no details. "We are 
in close touch with our ambassador in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) who 
is speaking to local elders," said the spokesman. There had 
been no ransom demand, he added. The British embassy in 
neighbouring Ethiopia also has responsibility for Somalia. 
  The Foreign Office believe the three had been taken in a 
dispute between rival clansmen. The British Embassy in Addis 
Ababa has been assured the men are not in any danger. They were 
on a trip to look at work by the charity Action Aid in the 
region when they were taken.

  [Text] The two British MPs kidnapped along with a charity 
worker by armed clansmen in Somalia have been released, the 
Foreign Office said today. 
  Mark Robinson, 47, Tory MP for Somerton and Frome and a 
former minister, and Tony Worthington, 52, Labour MP for 
Clydebank and Milngavie were taken on Wednesday night with 
ActionAid external relations manager Jeff Chinnock. 
  The MPs were abducted near Erigavo, north-west Somalia, 
during a week-long fact-finding mission in the Horn of Africa 
country wracked by famine and bloody feuds between local 
warlords. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We can confirm that they 
are at the ActionAid office in Erigavo and we understand they 
will fly out tomorrow." 
  The spokesman said it was too dark to consider flying the 
released men out tonight.

  [Text] Two Italian aid workers whose names are still not 
known were kidnapped this morning in an area northwest of Giohar 
[place name as received] in Somalia. Contacts with Somali 
delegations are already under way in an effort to secure the 
release of the two hostages, and Mario Scialoia, the Italian 
ambassador in Mogadishu, has taken steps to solve the problem. 
  Meanwhile, in a meeting with Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary 
Carmelo Azzara, interim Somali President Ali Mahdi has asked for 
the Italian contingent to remain in Somalia, or at the very 
least for it to be "the last to leave the country."

  [Text] [Announcer] Italians are once again in trouble in 
Somalia. Two volunteers working for the CEFA [Comitato Europeo 
di Formazione Agraria, Bologna-based charity] humanitarian aid 
organization have been kidnapped near Giohar. Their names are 
not yet known. The Italian authorities are currently 
negotiating for the two Italians to be released. The kidnapping 
took place against the backdrop of an important diplomatic 
initiative being carried out by Italy. Achille D'Amelia reports 
from Somalia. 
  [D'Amelia] The news about the kidnapping of the two Italian 
aid workers in Giohar, 100 kilometres north-east of Mogadishu 
and where Italian Blue Helmets are based, was given by Somali 
sources to Foreign Ministry Under-Secretary [Carmelo] Azzara and 
the Italian delegation which is trying to create a network of 
talks and mutual interest between local clans, a network that 
would guarantee a peaceful withdrawal for our contingent. 
  The climate is tense in Mogadishu and all over Somalia. Our 
friends are chiding us over our withdrawal and those who have 
given their arms to us are now empty-handed, but the kidnapping 
of the two Italian aid workers, whose names are still not known, 
seems to have more to do with economic motives -- a banal ransom 
demand -- than political ones. Specially selected units of 
Italian troops and helicopters have been sent to Giohar, where 
the kidnapping took place, by the Italian Blue Helmets 
commander, General [Carmine] Fiore; but, above all, he has 
invited village elders to show reason.

  [Text] Good evening. Negotiations to free the two Italian 
aid workers held hostage by Somali bandits in a village some 80 
km from Mogadishu will resume tomorrow. There is talk of a 
ransom demand of $50,000. Achille D'Amelia reports. 
  [D'Amelia] The two Italian aid workers kidnapped in Somalia 
remain in the hands of their captors, at least for tonight. The 
elders of the village of Timare, where the men were kidnapped, 
are giving assurances that all will be resolved upon the payment 
of the $50,000 ransom. However, things may not necessarily turn 
out that way. A ransom has not been paid in other cases, and 
hostages have been released. 
  Italian Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Carmelo Azzara and 
the diplomatic delegation that was visiting Somalia on another 
mission related to the safety of the Italian contingent during 
their withdrawal have ceased their other activities and have 
said that they will remain here until the release of Sergio 
Passadore and Gianfranco Stefani has been obtained. The 
original mission has been suspended. The under secretary and 
Ambassadors [Maurizio] Moreno and [Mario] Scialoja were 
scheduled to go on to Nairobi, Addis Ababa, Asmara, Djibouti, 
and Cairo. In fact, they were scheduled to meet General Aidid 
in Nairobi.

killed and another wounded here Sunday [13 February] when 
unidentified Somali gunmen ambushed their convoy, a United

  Earlier two Italian aid workers were kidnapped at gunpoint 
in 
the town of Jowhar, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) from the 
capital Mogadishu, Major Chris Budge told reporters.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] After nearly three weeks of ethnic violence in 
northeastern Ghana between Komkombas and Dagombas, which spread 
across the region affecting the main town of Tamale and sending 
thousands of refugees into neighboring Togo, people in the 
region are beginning to take stock of the human cost of the 
conflict. On Thursday [10 February], the Ghanaian Government 
declared a three- month state of emergency in northeastern Ghana 
and now security personnel have taken advantage of this to begin 
searching for the bodies of those who were killed in the 
fighting in order to bury them so as to avoid any outbreak of 
epidemics. From Tamale, Eliasu Adamu telexed this report: 
  So far 168 bodies have been buried mainly by the roadside, 
but there are many more in the bush. Briefing President Jerry 
Rawlings, who was at the war zone to assess the situation, the 
northern sector brigade commander, Brigadier Joseph Smith, said 
101 corpses have been buried in the Nanumba District and 67 in 
Yendi District. He told the president that three soldiers were 
also killed last Wednesday [9 February] by the Komkombas when 
they were lured into a trap. He said the Komkombas had invited 
the soldiers for a dialogue on cease-fire but were ambushed on 
the way and murdered. They were stripped of their uniforms and 
their arms and their ammunition was taken away. The military 
vehicle they were using was also burnt. 
  Over 50 villages have been completely burnt, including 
almost 
all villages along the Salaga-Bimbila-Yendi road. The few 
villages that have not been burnt have been deserted. Between 
Bakpaba and Adibo, a distance of about 10 miles from the 
Yendi-Bimbila road, I counted 40 decomposing corpses, including 
women and toddlers littering the road. The babies, who were 
apparently taken off the backs of their slain mothers, still had 
arrows in them. I also saw a lot of foodstuffs, especially yams 
and maize completely burnt. This will definitely affect the 
food situation in the country because the war zone is the main 
source of the country's yams. 
  President Rawlings, who flew over the area, was emotionally 
moved by the extent of the destruction and said it was wrong for 
any ethnic group to use violence to achieve its objectives. He 
said the government will ensure that no single ethnic group 
could hold the whole region to ransom. But just as we were told 
that the situation was calm, the Komkombas attacked and were 
burning Bimpielega, four miles from Yendi. They fired at our 
convoy and our escort had to return fire to scare them.

  [Excerpt] The president, Flight-Lieutenant J.J. Rawlings, 
has appealed to all whose interests are at stake in land 
disputes in parts of the country to exercise restraint. He said 
they must also avoid provocations and confrontations which only 
lead to loss of life and property. These were contained in a 
speech read for him by the presidential adviser on chieftancy 
affairs, Nana Akuoko Sarpong at the grand durbar at Abetifi to 
round off the Afahye [traditional festival] of the people of the 
Kwahu traditional area. 
  Flight-Lieutenant Rawlings assured the people that all such 
land cases will be thoroughly investigated by government to 
enable peace to prevail. The president said Ghanaians have 
centuries-old institutions to settle communal differences. But 
lately, violence threatens to break the country apart. He 
therefore emphasized the need for peace in all communities. He 
said all must have the will to talk and stay at the talking 
table until agreement is reached. President Rawlings advised the 
people of Kwahu to use their rich business experience to promote 
the export trade in the country. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] A renewed appeal has been made to the federal 
authorities to take necessary measures to check incursions into 
Nigerian territory by Cameroonian gendarmes. A community leader 
in Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Godwin Obote, told newsmen in Lagos that 
thousands of people in Akwa Ibom and Cross River States have 
fled their homes because of incursions, especially in Bakassi 
Peninsula. Mr. Obote suggested the stationing of troops in the 
affected areas with the mandate to strike back if the invasion 
persisted. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] A full-scale confrontation is looming between 
Nigeria and Cameroon over their long-disputed border region. 
Trouble blew up last month with claims that Nigerian villagers 
and fishermen on islands and a peninsula in the region were 
being harassed and killed by Cameroon gendarmes. Nigerian 
troops were sent to the area to protect Nigerian nationals, and 
this week the NIGERIAN NEWS AGENCY claimed that 18,000 Nigerians 
were fleeing the Bakasi Peninsula after raids by Cameroon 
gendarmes. The Cameroon external affairs minister denied the 
charges on this program yesterday, but a visit to Cameroon by 
Nigeria's foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, apparently 
achieved little or nothing. On the line to Abuja, Alice Martin 
asked Babagana Kingibe if he thought the two countries were on 
the verge of war: 
  [Begin recording] [Kingibe] No, absolutely not, because it 
is our determination and we do have the responsibility to ensure 
safety of lives and property of all Nigerians, wherever they may 
be, and it is indeed true that, perhaps, these provocations have 
reached saturation point as regards Nigerians living in the 
(Atabue) local government area of Cross River State, part of 
which is on the Bakasi Peninsula. I don't think we are going to 
tolerate any more harassment of our nationals from whatever 
quarters. We wouldn't tolerate the harassment of our fishermen 
and their catch being confiscated at will. But we do not have 
to go to war in order to guaratee the safety of life and 
property of Nigerians. We are just going to make jolly sure 
that it doesn't happen again and it will not happen again! 
  [Martin] And how can you be sure? 
  [Kingibe] There has been a continuing neglect and that 
neglect will not continue. We'll stop it and we are going to 
establish our effective presence over there. 
  [Martin] So, you are actually moving in now to the peninsula 
where Cameroon says it territorial control? 
  [Kingibe] Not that we are moving in. We are there. We have 
always been there. 
  [Martin] Cameroon says it owns, historically owns that area. 
  [Kingibe] Now, I don't know how anybody can really come and 
claim a territory that is wholly, entirely Nigerian populated. 
Really, even from the traditional system of establishing 
authority, these are Efik-speaking people and Ibibio-speaking 
people who owe their allegiance to the Oba [title of traditional 
chief] of Calabar and there all sorts of historical documents to 
that effect. So, you don't just wake up and make a claim that 
this is your territory. You must have a basis. 
  [Martin] But the fact is that Cameroon says that the land 
itself belongs to Cameroon, irrespective of whether Nigerians 
are living there. 
  [Kingibe] No, the land never belonged to Cameroon. Madam, I 
don't think that I am comfortable in negotiating with the 
Cameroonians via the BBC. We are brothers, we are very close 
brothers and friends and have been able to talk to each other 
directly and quietly before. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, 10 Feb (PANA) -- The former Nigerian minister 
of external affairs, Bolaji Akinyemi, has said Nigeria and 
Cameroon must thrash out the "fundamental issues" behind their 
recurrent border crises. Reacting to a NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA 
(NAN) report on a fresh attack by Cameroonian gendarmes on 
Nigerians in the Bakassi Peninsula in south-eastern Akwa Ibom 
State, Akinyemi said the "Maroua Declaration" signed by former 
Nigerian head of state Yakubu Gowon and President Ahmadu Ahidjo 
in the 70s, should be revisited. 
  "Arising out of that (declaration), where is the boundary? 
Asked Akinyemi, who as director-general of the Nigerian 
Institute of International Affairs, was a member of a Nigerian 
task-force set up in the late 80s "to examine and prepare a 
report on the Bakassi Peninsula in all its ramifications". The 
former minister said that both countries could use the various 
organs set up for conflict resolution in the world. "But until 
it is resolved, if they (Cameroon) put their troops there, you 
put your troops there, too", declared Akinyemi, whose comments 
were reported by the press in Lagos on Thursday. 
  NAN reported Tuesday that some 18,000 Nigerians had been 
forced to flee their homes in the latest gendarmes' attack. 
Nigeria responded to a similar attack last December by 
deploying troops to the Bakassi Peninsula. Foreign Minister 
Baba Gana Kingibe also visited Cameroon over the incident, after 
which both counties agreed to set up a joint patrol to stem 
future border clashes.

  [Text] Lome, 10 Feb (PANA) -- Togo's second round 
parliamentary election campaigning is due to start on Friday [11 
February] and end on 18 February, it was officially announced 
Wednesday evening in Lome. In the first ballot, parties with 
links to President Gnassingbe Togolese People's Assembly [Rally] 
(RPT) won a total of 35 seats while 22 went to the opposition, 
according to provisional results published by the National 
Electoral Commission (CEN) in Lome. 
  Still at stake are 24 seats in 12 constituencies which are 
expected to be closely fought for by the two main opposition 
parties, the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) of Yao 
Agboyibor, and the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD) led by 
Edem Kodjo, a former minister and secretary general of the 
Organisation of African Unity (OAU). 
  A stiff competition is also expected between the RPT and the 
New Forces Coordination (CFN) of Prime Minister Joseph Kokou 
Koffigoh. A head-on collision between parties in the opposition 
grouping and pro-Eyadema parties is also inevitable in 11 
constituencies.

  [Text] Lome, 11 Feb (AFP) -- All moderate Togolese 
opposition parties today called for a "general mobilization" 
against President Gnassingbe Eyadema's supporters. They called 
on the electorate to vote for their two parties, which are still 
in the race for the second round of the 20 February legislative 
elections. 
  In a joint communique sent to AFP, the eight parties, 
including the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) and Togolese 
Union for Democracy (UTD), "exhort" voters who did not 
participate in the first round on 6 February to "realize the 
importance of what is at stake and turn out massively on 20 
February to block the way to the forces that are hostile to 
change." 
  According to the Togolese constitution, the head of state is 
bound to choose his prime minister from the parliamentary 
majority. Yesterday night the CAR and the UTD formed a "common 
front" for the second round for which they are the only two 
representing the opposition. 
  After the 6 February voting General Eyadema's party members 
obtained 35 out of 81 seats, while the opposition obtained a 
total of 22 and was assured of winning 12 more on 20 February. 
Victory will depend on the results from 12 constituencies. In 
11 of these constituencies pro-Eyadema candidates are facing 
opposition representatives, while Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh 
will fight it out in the last constituency with another 
pro-Eyadema candidate. 
  In last Sunday's election, the participation rate was put at 
65.12 percent, as against 39 percent during the presidential 
elections of last August, which was boycotted by all opposition 
parties.

  [Text] Lome, 13 Feb (AFP)--On 13 February, the Rally of the 
Togolese People [RPT], which supports President Eyadema, said 
the common front formed by the opposition for the second round 
of parliamentary elections on 20 February was a "facade 
coalition." 
  In a communique sent to AFP in Lome, RPT stated that the 
front "will only last about as long as other opposition accords, 
and at the first chance it will break up and give way to 
disorder." 
  According to the former sole party, "the people's main 
concern is to give the head of state a comfortable parliamentary 
majority in order to avoid a return to the wave of 
sociopolitical disturbances and unending strikes." 
  The Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese 
Union 
for Democracy [UTD], which will be representing the opposition 
in the second round, formed a common front on 11 February for 
the 20 February elections. 
  On 11 February, all the moderate opposition parties, 
including the six parties which did not make it in the first 
round, called for "general mobilization" against President 
Eyadema's supporters. They also called on the people to vote 
for UTD and CAR candidates. 
  The presidential group candidates obtained 35 seats in the 
first round of elections on 6 February. The opposition obtained 
22 seats in the first round but will obtain 12 other seats on 20 
February since CAR and UTD candidates will be contesting the run 
off.

  [Text] Lome, 13 Feb (AFP)--The Togolese Government 
denounced acts of violence perpetrated by activists of the 
Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] against pro-Eyadema activists 
(of the Rally of Togolese People, RPT) on the evening of 12 
February. The government did not give any details about the 
nature of the violence. 
  Interior Minister Combevi Agbodjan said on national 
television that "in certain cities and villages," of the Haho 
Prefecture (98 km north of Lome), CAR militants have "accused" 
President Gnassingbe Eyadema's supporters of not having voted 
for their candidate. 
  Questioned by AFP, CAR deputy general secretary, Mr. 
Togoatta 
Apedoh Amah, denounced this "provocative act" by the RPT which 
is trying to justify a repression against the activists of the 
opposition before the second round of the legislative election 
slated for 20 February. 
  At the end of the first round on 6 February, the opposition, 
represented in the second round by CAR and the Togolese Union 
for Democracy, was running neck and neck with the RPT, the 
former sole ruling party. 
  The minister also called on traditional rulers "who are 
making every effort to create a climate of hatred in their 
villages" to remain neutral while awaiting the second round of 
elections. He also called on political party leaders to "better 
control their activists" so that the second round of election 
would take place "in as good an atmosphere" as the first round.

<F P=106> ["Clarification" by the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) </F>
in Lome on 13 February; read by CAR Deputy Chairman (Dawal 
Evor)--recorded] 
  [Text] Following the communique read on Saturday, 12 
February 1994, on state radio and television by the minister of 
territorial administration and security about a threat of action 
committed by CAR supporters against supporters of the Rally of 
the Togolese People [RPT] in the Haho region, the CAR wants to 
make the following clarifications: 
  First, according to information collected, the chief of a 
village in the Haho region scolded a relative -- and this was 
done without any violence -- for not voting for his candidate, 
that is, the CAR candidate during the first round of the 
legislative elections. But at no time were any threats made 
regarding RPT supporters, nor was there any violence used on RPT 
supporters anywhere. It is not in the CAR's interest at all to 
provoke incidents in electoral constituency where it is poised 
to win at least 60 percent of votes in the second round, with 
the help of other parties of the democratic opposition. 
  Second, the CAR was informed that acts of provocation were 
going to be committed by RPT militiamen, disguised as supporters 
of the democratic opposition, in order to set off repression, 
which would frighten away voters in favor of change in electoral 
constituencies where the RPT is neck and neck with opposition 
candidates. Furthermore, plans reportedly have been hatched to 
assassinate some democratic opposition leaders, in order to 
decapitate the democratic forces before the second round of 
polls. 
  Third, in his communique, the minister of territorial 
administration and security does not give any proof of his 
allegations. He rather displays his partiality by designating 
the CAR by name, whereas a few days earlier, he declined to 
blame a party which was responsible for the serious incidents 
which occurred at Agou, although he knows the culprits quite 
well. 
  Do we have to remind the minister of the acts of 
intimidation 
and corruption exerted on the traditional chiefs of the northern 
region, which prevented free expression by the voters of that 
region? Is the minister's communique not actually meant to 
prepare people's mind for the acts of violence planned by the 
RPT? 
  The CAR launches an urgent appeal to the head of state and 
the authorities to assume their responsibilities, to the 
International Monitoring Committee to intervene so that military 
and civilian observers are deployed as a matter of priority to 
the 11 electoral constituencies where the opposition is facing 
the RPT. 
  The CAR once again affirms its irrevocable option for non- 
violence and calls on the people to remain vigilant and not to 
give in to provocations and intimidations.

  [Text] Five hundred tonnes of food for the residents of 
Cubal and Ganda almost failed to reach their destination. The 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
wanted to steal them, or worse, to destroy them. This happened 
when men in the pay of Jonas Savimbi attacked the food convoy at 
Alto Capaca, between Cubal and Ganda in Benguela Province. The 
23-truck convoy carried food provided by the Angolan Government 
and nongovernment organizations. The Angolan Armed Forces quick 
intervention repelled the attack. Two drivers and Cubal deputy 
administrator Domingos Carlito were wounded in the attack.

  [Text] The situation in the city of Cuito has returned to 
normal after the shelling experienced midmorning. The afternoon 
was relatively calm and most of the people abandoned their 
hideouts to look for something to eat. If this situation 
continues until tomorrow, it is very probable that a World Food 
Program [WFP] aircraft will land in the city of Cuito with food 
for the people who are once again experiencing a serious food 
crisis. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports. 
  If the calm experienced since early this afternoon continues 
until tomorrow, WFP aircraft could land in the city bringing 
food. If the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] does not again shell the city in the coming few hours, 
the thousands and thousands of residents hope to receive 
assistance from international humanitarian organizations to save 
them from famine which is killing people, particularly in Cunje 
commune. 
  This afternoon we learned that four orphans, under the 
control of the provincial branch of the Social Reintegration 
Ministry, were killed and six others wounded in the latest UNITA 
shellings.

  [Text] Nothing has changed in Lusaka. The delegation from 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
continues to be absent. Our correspondent Joao Ligio reports. 
  The government and UNITA have not yet resumed discussions on 
national reconciliation. To overcome the obstacle which is 
preventing its resumption, the mediator, Alioune Blondin Beye, 
set a meeting for this afternoon, but UNITA did not appear. The 
Black Cockerel's men said they cannot do anything without the 
remaining part of the delegation, which according to reports, 
will only return to Lusaka on 15 February. In the face of this 
obstinacy, Chief Beye had no alternative but to wait. 
  Meanwhile, work is progressing rapidly on the government 
side. The government delegation has already expressed its stand 
on the general principles for national reconciliation and today 
went to Mulungushi Center to present its reaction to the UN 
proposal on the mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission -- 
the UN role in controlling and monitoring approved principles on 
the cease-fire, the conclusion of the army, and the national 
army. 
  Also present in Lusaka are the presidents of three national 
political parties -- namely, the (?Liberal Democratic Party), 
[name indistinct], and the Angolan Democratic Party. The three 
went to the Mulungushi Conference Center without warning and 
wanted to have access to the documents being studied but had the 
same fortune as journalists -- they left the center without 
gaining extra knowledge.

  [Text] Chief Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative 
of the UN secretary general in Angola, arrived in Luanda from 
the Zambian capital a few moments ago. Beye did not make any 
statement on his arrival. The Lusaka peace talks continue 
[words indistinct]. The negotiating team of the National Union

returned to Lusaka. Only Jorge Valentim is in the Zambian 
capital and the negotiations, as such, have practically stopped. 
Chief Alioune Blondin Beye had no other alternative than to 
spend the weekend here in Luanda.

  [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the 
UN secretary general in Angola, who left for Luanda yesterday, 
has already returned to Lusaka, Zambia. Talks will resume in 
Lusaka tomorrow, and the working agenda will center on national 
reconciliation. 
  In Luanda, the Malian diplomat held a working meeting with 
the French cooperation minister and requested the Luanda 
Communist government to suspend the ban on distribution of 
humanitarian assistance to areas administered by the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
  Observers continue to insist that the parties should discuss 
national reconciliation with great care and skill, because it is 
the center point of any agreement that may come about in the 
Zambian capital. 
  It should be pointed out that Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, 
a 
member of the UNITA delegation to the peace talks, assured the 
international press yesterday that the two parties had already 
reached an agreement on the arrival of blue helmets in Angola to 
supervise the agreements that may result from the ongoing peace 
talks.

  [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the

Zambia. This means that the negotiating teams will carry out 
work tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon, UNITA delegates returned to 
Lusaka after eight days of absence. A meeting will be held 
tomorrow morning [words indistinct] national reconciliation. 
Instead of the scheduled plenary meeting, it is very probable 
that UNITA will hold a meeting with the mediator in order to 
give its reply with regard to the mediators' document on 
national reconciliation. The document has already been approved 
by the government. 
  On his return to Lusaka today, Alioune Blondin Beye was as 
usual optimistic regarding the positive conclusion of the peace 
talks, although he feels it is still premature to set (?dates). 
Alioune Blondin Beye told Luanda Radio shortly before leaving 
for Lusaka that the mediators and the observers in the Angolan 
peace process are doing all they can to quickly reach an 
agreement in Lusaka and end the tragedy that Angola is 
experiencing today. Alioune Blondin Beye said: I have always 
said that I am optimistic [words indistinct].

men to fight, whereas UNITA will last for many years. Savimbi 
also spoke of relations with Portugal, stressing the good 
relations with [Portuguese President] Mario Soares. With regard 
to the [Portuguese] prime minister [Cavaco Silva], Savimbi said 
things were not doing as well. There will be more details of

<F P=106> [Report on interview with UNITA chairman Jonas Savimbi in </F>
Huambo by unidentified correspondent; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] The war is not going to solve the Angolan problem 
according to Jonas Savimbi, who was interviewed in Huambo by TVI. 
  [Begin Savimbi recording] For Angola, a military solution is 
a totally futile exercise because no one will win the war. Once 
again, it is demonstrating that, although materiel is important, 
the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] does 
not have the men to fight. This could go on for years. 
Therefore our intention is to continue negotiating in Lusaka. 
If it was possible to obtain an overall cease-fire, that would 
be ideal. This was UNITA's [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] request. Seeing that the four-month 
cease-fire that was in place proved that [words indistinct] we 
asked the MPLA, and the Luanda government to agree to extend not 
only in spirit [words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  Savimbi gave assurances that UNITA is continuing to 
negotiate 
with goodwill and determination, but also that UNITA has enough 
weapons to carry on fighting for many years. Savimbi said that 
with regard to Portugal, everything is well with [Portuguese 
President] Mario Soares, but he accuses [Prime Minister] Cavaco 
Silva of not doing so well. 
  [Begin Savimbi recording] I appealed for better relations 
with the Portuguese Government, but I was shocked when I was 
told by our representative [in Lisbon] Adalberto that Prime 
Minister Cavaco Silva made a point of returning the Christmas 
card that Adalberto had sent. First, this is not polite. It is 
not polite. It is a totally aggressive gesture, aggressive. He 
could have torn the card and let UNITA think he had read the 
card. But for the prime minister to return it....[pauses] He is 
a member of the MPLA. Prime Minister Cavaco Silva is doing well. 
I have excellent relations with the President of the Republic. 
I ring him frequently. He is behaving like a true Portuguese 
politician who has a concept of the historic relations between 
Portugal and Angola. But the Prime Minister is not doing well.

  [Text] Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, chairman of the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, said 
over the weekend that UNITA is in favor of a nationwide 
cease-fire. He was speaking in an interview with Portuguese 
Television in Huambo. Dr. Savimbi said UNITA is determined to 
advance the negotiating process under way in the Zambian 
capital, Lusaka. As stated previously by UNITA high officials, 
Dr. Savimbi has once again said that it is not possible to solve 
the Angolan crisis through a military solution and appealed to 
the Luanda government to extend to other areas the truce 
unilaterally declared by UNITA in September 1993. Currently, 
UNITA controls 70 percent of Angolan territory. Dr. Jonas 
Malheiro Savimbi on 10 February met with members of UNITA 
delegation to the Lusaka talks for consultations.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge </F>
Chikoti by correspondent Berenice Bettencourt in Geneva; date 
not given--recorded] 
  [Text] The Angolan Government has accused Portugal of 
supporting UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola]. The Angolan deputy foreign minister has told the UN 
Human Rights Commission that all the countries that authorize 
UNITA to set up offices on their soil share in the 
responsibility for the war, which has left over 500,000 people 
dead in Angola in one year alone. [figure as heard] 
  Berenice Bettencourt reports from Geneva: 
  [Bettencourt] Angolan Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chikoti 
denounced cases of involvement in the Angolan civil war by 
foreign countries, which support UNITA for reasons pertaining to 
their own interests and are, in his opinion, co-responsible for 
over 500,000 dead, 200,000 amputees, and the country's general 
state of famine and destruction. According to Chikoti, it is 
the aforementioned countries that--together with UNITA--are 
fomenting human rights violations in Angola. When I interviewed 
Chikoti, he told me he said this to the UN Human Rights 
Commission. 
  [Begin recording] [Bettencourt] Which countries do you mean? 
  [Chikoti] Well, directly, in military terms, there is South 
Africa. Then there is Zaire, which supports UNITA logistically 
and allows it free passage through its territory. The political 
support comes from all the western countries that still have 
UNITA offices on their soil and where UNITA resorts to all 
manner of false propaganda. As you know, UNITA has one or two 
offices in the United States, one in Britain, one in France, and 
one in Portugal. These are the very countries that have 
diplomatic relations with Angola at the same time, the very same 
countries that once expressed the wish that Angola should 
undergo a democratic process--which was done. So UNITA must not 
be allowed subterfuge. In so doing, these countries are trying 
to show UNITA that even though it is waging war, even though it 
lost the elections, they are still prepared to give it shelter.

  [Text] Durban Feb 14 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini 
hinted strongly at secession on Monday, saying he was preparing 
to promulgate a constitution for kwaZulu and Natal to establish 
an autonomous monarchy. 
  King Zwelithini said in a memorandum to be delieverd to 
State 
President F. W. de Klerk in Durban later on Monday [14 February] 
that with the adoption of the national interim constitution, and 
after failed negotiations to amend it, "a situation has emerged 
which brings back into existence the kingdom of kwaZulu and its 
full sovereignty". 
  "I am preparing myself to promulgate the constitution of 
kwaZulu and Natal which will establish a monarchy modelled after 
the best examples of democratic and pluralistic monarchies in 
the world." The current national constitution "is not the 
constitution of the Zulu nation, which will neither now -- nor 
at any time in the future -- be bound by this constitution". 
  He said the Zulu nation retained its inalienable right to 
self- determination and "if the society expressed by the Zulu 
nation cannot co-exist with other societies in a united South 
Africa, then it becomes necessary and ineluctable that the 
society expressed by the Zulu nation exists on its own, with its 
own territorial bases and with its own government". 
  King Zwelithini said the Zulu nation had always been a 
sovereign one. Although his nation had been conquered, its 
sovereignty had not been eliminated. "Those who conquered us, 
namely the white nations of Afrikaner and British, are now 
relinquishing their sovereignty over the land of South Africa. 
The nation which was exercising sovereignty over the land is 
abdicating its power to open the door for new nations to 
exercise their sovereignty over the land. Under this set of 
circumstances, I take the position that the sovereignty of the 
Zulu nation is revived, and I am advised that this position is 
also supported by the international law of decolonisation." 
  The Zulu nation had not been defeated in war or conquered by 
"those who are preparing themselves to exercise their 
sovereignty over the land". 
  "Therefore we take the position that they have gained no 
right for themselves to rule over our nation, and their rule 
cannot force us to merge with all other nations of South Africa 
in a unified government." 
  The Zulu nation did not want to be ruled by a government of 
a 
unitary state but would be ruled only by its own government for 
its own people. "I demand that you, Mr President, give the Zulu 
nation the opportunity to become free once again and to choose 
their own destiny for themselves." 
  The Zulu monarch charged the interim constitution did not 
offer space for his nation's survival. Referring to the 
rewriting of the interim constitution by a constituent assembly 
after the April elections, King Zwelithini said the Zulu 
monarchy and nation "cannot walk this road". 
  The king rejected the notion of a referendum in 
Natal/kwaZulu 
on the future of the region, saying it would become an intensely 
fought party political contest between those who wanted to 
"subjugate kwaZulu to Pretoria, and those who want the 
expression of sovereignty in kwaZulu to be a healing of the 
divisions in kwaZulu". 
  Earlier, kwaZulu chief minister and Inkatha Freedom Party 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi told about 20,000 Zulus packed 
into King's Park soccer stadium that he wanted peace, and for 
that the issues raised by the king would have to be addressed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial] </F>
  [Text] The saga concerning the future of kwaZulu thickens 
day by day. Last Sunday, the king met with President F.W. de 
Klerk where it is reported the monarch said he wanted the 
boundaries of Zulu territory restored to what they were before 
the Zulus were conquered, so that the Zulu nation can determine 
its own future. This coming Monday the monarch will again meet 
with the state president. This shows things are getting hot. 
  We were not aware that things would come to this in this 
country, because we had hoped that negotiations would take the 
path of genuine compromise leading to the satisfaction of all 
concerned. We did not foresee that things would come to a stage 
where the Zulu nation would demand what rightfully belonged to 
it. We did not know that things would deteriorate to a stage 
where the very unity of South Africa would be put in jeopardy as 
we presently see it. 
  The situation, however, has been spoiling for a long time. 
When a proposal that a separate delegation from the king be 
part of Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa] was 
rejected, that was the start of the problem. When a proposal 
that a delegation of the kwaZulu government be part of Codesa 
was also rejected, that too further soured the situation. When 
the ANC [African National Congress] and its allies, COSATU 
[Congress of South African Trade Unions] and the SACP [South 
African Communist Party], resolved to begin a campaign to 
destroy kwaZulu, that further aggravated the situation. 
  When, at the Kempton Park talks, government and ANC 
negotiators conspired to make side deals, that also soured 
things. When kwaZulu government proposals for a new 
dispensation that allowed for regional autonomy was rejected, 
that was part of the disintegration. When admonitions by other 
leaders of the same mind as the prime minister of kwaZulu -- 
that the way the negotiations were being conducted was wrong -- 
were cast aside as of no consequence, that was again part of the 
disintegration. When the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] protests 
that too much power was being vested in the central government 
was ignored, that was part of the deterioration of the situation. 
  Now it appears that this country is facing a very uncertain 
future. The situation is truly precarious!

  [Text] Nineteen parties will contest South Africa's first 
all-party election in April on a national or provincial basis. 
However, the poll could go ahead without the Inkatha Freedom 
Party, the Bophuthatswana Government, and the Afrikaner 
Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] which includes the 
Conservative Party. The three Freedom Alliance members failed 
to register before last night's midnight deadline. But this 
came as no surprise as they had stated earlier that they would 
not be contesting the election despite a flurry of urgent 
meetings with the government and the ANC [African National 
Congress] in the pasts few weeks to try to accommodate their 
minimum demands for participation. Both the government and the 
ANC have expressed willingness to accept a possible extension of 
the deadline. 
  The main parties that will be contesting the elections are 
the ANC, the National Party, the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], 
and the Democratic Party. Others in the race are the African 
Christian Democratic Party, Mr. Armichand Rajbansi's Minority 
Front, and several parties with strong regional bases. Qwaqwa 
based Dikwankwetla [The Strong], Gazankulu's Ximoko Progressive 
Party, Lebowa's United People's Front, and the Ciskei-based 
African Democratic Movement. The more conventional parties were 
joined by several new comers with diverse election tickets. 
These includes the Realists, the North-West Democratic, the 
Merit Party, the Islamic, the Workers' International to rebuild 
the fourth international South Africa, and the worker's list 
parties. Three parties hope to bring women's interests to the 
fore. They are the Women's Rights Peace Party, the South 
African Women's Party, and a One Woman Party, the Keep It 
Straight and Simple Party, or KISS, for short, whose main thrust 
is the abolition of taxes.

  [Text] Parties will know on the fourth of next month, when 
the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] releases a list, 
whether their applications for the April election have been 
approved. 
  Applications for registration closed at midnight last night. 
Details of the applications will be published in the government 
gazette on Tuesday. Nineteen parties signed their applications. 
Members of the Freedom alliance, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party], the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front], the 
Conservative Party and Bophuthatswana did not register. 
  A senior spokesman for the Electoral Commission, Mr. Peter 
Cronje, said the only condition under which late applicants will 
be considered was if political parties involved in the 
Transitional Executive Council reconvened a session of 
Parliament to amend the act. Mr. Cronje said that between 7,000 
and 10,000 polling booths were expected to be in place for the 
election. He said the IEC would attempt to make ballot boxes 
accessible to all areas. These included hostels in black 
residential areas and other anticipated flash points. 
  Party-political broadcasts and advertisements were to be 
banned from television between the fourth of next month and the 
25th of April.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with IFP spokesman Walter Felgate, ANC </F>
spokesman Dullah Omar, and Constitutional Development Minister 
and NP chief negotiator Roelf Meyer by announcer Rodney Trudgeon 
on the "Radio Today" program--live] 
  [Text] [Trudgeon] There's growing fear that South Africa's 
first democratic elections may not occur if no agreement is 
reached between Government and ANC [African National Congress] 
negotiators on the one hand, and the Freedom Alliance on the 
other. On the line right now we have Mr. Walter Felgate from 
the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and also Mr. Dulla Omar from the 
ANC to explain something about what the situation is at present. 
If we can begin with you, Mr. Felgate, what is the IFP's 
standpoint at the moment with what seems to be a fairly major 
deadlock in negotiations? 
  [Felgate] Well, the IFP is seeking to give some kind of 
realistic and meaningful role for provinces in the building of 
democracy. Things hang together. The provincial constitution, 
the provincial power, the financing for provincial functions and 
the protection of these structures and functions all hang 
together. Damage to one is damage to all. And as the 
constitution is now written, the constitutional assembly with a 
text introduced by as little as a 50 percent plus one majority 
could replace the penned constitution with an entirely new 
constitution and that new constitution could obliterate 
everything that is done in the interim period at the provincial 
constitutional level. There is no continuity guaranteed, 
there's no powers that are guaranteed, there are no structures 
that are guaranteed, and indeed if you look carefully at the 
principles, the principles of any value only come into operation 
after the next constitution is actually adopted. 
  [Trudgeon] Mr. Dullah Omar of the ANC is also on the line 
with us. Mr. Omar, why are you so keen -- having heard that -- 
that the IFP should take part in the elections? 
  [Omar] We are keen that the IFP should participate in the 
election because we consider them to be an important player in 
South Africa, and it would be in the broader interest of the 
country that they do take part. I think, however, that Mr. 
Felgate is not correct in a number of things. 
  Firstly there's nowhere in the constitution any provision 
that the constitutional assembly can by a resolution of 50 
percent plus one adopt any constitution. This is completely 
incorrect. The constitution provides that a constitutional 
assembly shall adopt a new constitution by a two thirds 
majority. It also provides that when it also comes to the 
question of power, functions of regions, the provisions of a new 
constitution must also be adopted by the senate by a two thirds 
majority. 
  [Trudgeon] Now, Mr. Felgate, we've also heard that the 
Freedom Alliance is going to register as a political party, 
which is quite a significant move, isn't it? 
  [Felgate] But I think you must first allow me a very short 
rejoinder to what Mr. Dullah Omar has just said. It is entirely 
true that the only constitutional text that could go to a panel 
of constitutional experts, could go to a constitutional court, 
could be put before the people in a referendum. The only 
constitution in that process could in fact be introduced by a 50 
percent plus one majority. I did not say adopt; I said 
introduce. But if that's the only constitution that we can 
consider, then it has very serious implications. Around the 
world it is already the other way round. A special majority is 
required to adopt a constitution or even introduce a 
constitution and a simpler majority is required in a referendum. 
That rejoinder just must be made, sorry I interrupted you. 
  [Trudgeon] No, fine. I interrupted you. Do carry on about 
your comments about the Freedom Alliance becoming or registering 
as a political party. 
  [Felgate] The Freedom Alliance has made no decision 
whatsoever to register as political party. The component 
members of the Freedom Alliance may or may not register. We as 
an alliance are adamant on one thing, and that is that we cannot 
enter into an election under the present constitution with its 
restrictions. The IFP has made it very clear as a component of 
the Freedom Alliance that we will not begin thinking about 
registration until we have got some kind of an all-inclusive 
constitutional settlement. So the registration issue arises 
only once we have got an all-inclusive constitutional settlement. 
  [Trudgeon] Thank you Mr. Walter Felgate of the IFP for 
joining us and still on the line is Mr. Dullah Omar. Mr. Omar, 
this regional problem seems to be a major stumbling block with 
the Freedom Alliance, and with the IFP in particular. Do you 
agree that it is an important issue for them that should be 
considered by the government and the ANC? 
  [Omar] It is an important issue. I also think it is an 
important issue for us. I want to add, however, that in respect 
of all those matters that Mr. Felgate has raised, adequate 
protection has been created. I think I must point out that with 
regard to Section 126 which deals with the powers and functions 
of regions. Both the ANC and the government moved considerably 
in order to accommodate the Freedom Alliance. You know the 
problem is you cannot negotiate at gun point. It is difficult 
for the ANC to negotiate when we are accosted with a set of 
demands which are put to us as being nonnegotiable and as a take 
it or leave it situation. 
  Now with regard to powers and functions of regions, we moved 
considerably. The present constitution provides for concurrent 
powers only. We moved and said that there are a number of 
aspects in which we would agree to exclusive powers for regions, 
and regions would have been able, provinces would have been able 
to exercise autonomy in respect of all these powers. There are 
certain matters in respect of which concurrent powers should 
remain -- matters such as education, health, and generally 
matters of national concern. But even in respect of those powers 
the ability of central government to intervene would have been 
limited. So we met them in respect of that. When it came to 
the structures of government within provinces, there again we 
were prepared to say that provinces need not adhere to the 
provisions of the current constitution. 
  [Trudgeon] Joining us on the line now we have the 
government's chief negotiator, Mr. Roelf Meyer. Good morning 
Mr. Meyer, and thank you for your time. We are discussing this 
issue of regionalism that seems such a stumbling block with the 
IFP. We were talking to Walter Felgate a few moments ago. Do 
you feel that the government has done enough in giving in on 
this regionalism issue? 
  [Meyer] Well, it's not a question of giving in. It is what 
we have negotiated. The problem is actually the fact that the 
Freedom Alliance was not at Kempton Park at the Negotiating 
Council where we have negotiated the contents of the 
constitution, especially the IFP walked out of it on the 2d of 
July last year already. And throughout the last part of last 
year those parties that remained there negotiated exactly the 
way in which provision should be made in a constitution for the 
powers, functions and boundaries and so forth of the provinces 
in the future. 
  And at those negotiations we took a particular viewpoint and 
that is that we want autonomous provincial structures as far as 
the future is concerned. So from government side that was our 
view and that is what I believe we have attained. In other 
words, we have succeeded in our goal as far as that goes through 
the process of negotiations. Now what the Freedom Alliance is 
actually wanting is something more, over and above what we have 
already written into the constitution. First of all they missed 
the opportunity while we were actually negotiating this already. 
But now we have come up with specific proposals on how to 
accommodate them as well and even at this late stage I would say 
give us your specific proposals so that we can look at it and 
see whether we can accommodate them. But you see, over the last 
week, 10 days, two weeks, we have made further and further 
compromises to accommodate them. In other words, we declared 
ourselves prepared to make amendments to the constitution in 
order to include them in the process. Now they want something 
more, and if we can just get clarity on that, maybe we can find 
a solution but then they have to provide us with that particular 
proposal today. 
  [Trudgeon] Time is certainly running short, Mr. Meyer, just 
how much more conciliatory are you going to be toward the 
Freedom Alliance and what do you think still needs to be done to 
get them in or what do you expect from them? 
  [Meyer] Well, the ball is in their court, in other words, to 
provide us with their specific proposals. You see, the problem 
is, we have from our side put the package on the table last 
Thursday for consideration. After we had looked at the total 
situation we said okay, look at the following proposal, and we 
included in that a number of critical items according to the 
wishes of the Freedom Alliance, as well including the two-ballot 
paper issue and so forth. And then Monday evening when we met, 
we heard from them that they would accept those proposals but 
they want something more. And what we say to them -- what we've 
said to them already Monday evening -- is give us a specific 
proposal in terms of what you want more so that we can look at 
that and see whether we can find an answer but the problem is, 
you know, every time it seems that the solution is probably 
coming, then new demands are being put, new goal posts are being 
set and I think that is the problem that the Freedom Alliance 
has internally because it is not a homogeneous organization. It 
is an organization consisting of four or five different 
components and each one has its own agenda almost. So that is 
the problem, but time-wise there is still some scope. The point 
is we would have preferred this all to have been concluded 
before the proclamation of the election. That was done last 
Wednesday. In terms of the Electoral Act, the time for 
registration of parties lapses this Saturday. So that is 
actually in a certain way the final moment because parties will 
have to decide before Saturday whether they are going to 
participate in the election. Of course if agreements can 
finally be reached in the next two days, consequential 
amendments flowing from those agreements can follow and of 
course we would be too happy to give effect to such agreements, 
but then we must get those agreement now over the next 48 hours. 
  [Trudgeon] Thank you Mr. Roelf Meyer who's the government's 
chief negotiator. Mr. Dullah Omar, if you are still on the line 
I should like to talk about the ANC's decision to register as a 
political party today. Was this a unanimous decision and why 
today specifically? 
  [Omar] Well, it is a unanimous decision. After all, 
elections is [as heard] what the ANC has been fighting for for 
so many years. There's no special significance in the day. We 
have to register before Saturday, and so we want to make sure 
that we have registered in time. I want to add that I hope that 
the Freedom Alliance and its components or its components will 
register for the elections. I don't think that the door to 
negotiations will ever be closed, and on the side of the ANC 
there will always be a preparedness to continue negotiating 
right up to election day and even after elections. 
  [Trudgeon] So you feel confident perhaps that there's still 
time to get the Freedom Alliance and the right wing in general 
into the election process? 
  [Omar] Well, I want to say that we are open in that regard, 
and the door to negotiations will never be closed. 
  [Trudgeon] Thank you, Mr. Dullah Omar, a spokesman for the 
ANC on the line to Radio Today, and our thanks as well to Walter 
Felgate and to chief government negotiator Roelf Meyer.

  [Text] The government's negotiator, Mr. Roelf Meyer, said 
the government is to approach individual parties in the Freedom 
Alliance in an effort to reach a political settlement. Mr. 
Meyer said he had asked the Freedom Alliance to make specific 
proposals regarding changes to the interim constitution earlier 
this week, but thus far no response has been received. He says 
that the Freedom Alliance has failed collectively to arrive at a 
common consensus, that is why the possibility of progress with 
indinvidual parties within the alliance was currently being 
investigated.

  [Text] With only six hours before the deadline for 
registration for the coming election expires, the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] announced that it will not take part. But 
the government and the ANC [African National Congress] have said 
they are prepared to give members of the Freedom Alliance more 
time for possible participation. 
  At a meeting in Ulundi, the IFP's Central Committee called 
for international mediation to bring about a negotiated 
settlement. The message from the Central Committee was clear -- 
no participation in the election with the constitution as it is 
at the moment. The party's negotiators gave feedback on the 
unsuccessful talks with the government and the ANC. Many of the 
members stated unequivocally that the negotiations had brought 
them nothing. 
  [Begin IFP leader Buthelezi recording in English] We want 
actually those things that have not been accommodated, 
accommodated. So I mean that question applies both ways because 
even now if those things were acquired -- even if there was no 
international mediation. If they were accommodated, we would 
still participate in the election. So because we have not 
acquired that that's why we now seek international mediation so 
that those things can be accommodated before we can participate 
in the election. [end recording]

  [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi has warned his supporters that they were heading for 
hard times. He was addressing an IFP rally at Ngwelezana just 
outside Empangeni in Natal, a day after the IFP's Central 
Committee decision that the party is not to take part in the 
elections. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Linda van Tilburg] The 
Youth 
Brigade, his young lions as Dr. Buthelezi calls them, came to 
listen to their leaders' message, but his words did not hold 
much hope for a peaceful new South Africa. 
  [Buthelezi in English] I would like to say that sadly -- it 
is also a sign of apprehension -- I am forced to warn you that 
there are difficult times ahead of us. 
  [Van Tilburg] Even some of his older supporters, some with 
sticks and [word indistinct] in their hands, all gathered with 
the young people at the Ngwelezana sport field. Many had been 
transported from the nearby Esikhawini township. For those 
people who have been living with violence for a long time, he 
said they must fight back when IFP members were being attacked. 
  To the government and the ANC [African National Congress] 
Dr. 
Buthelezi once again set out the demands for his party's 
participation in the election. They asked for recognition of 
the king's powers, a double ballot paper, an own tax base for 
regions, autonomy of Natal-kwaZulu, and also a federal system.

<F P=106> [Report by Billy Paddock] </F>
  [Text] A confidential Freedom Alliance strategy document 
proposes that in the event of the alliance boycotting the 
elections, it should prepare immediately for secession and 
create conditions making free and fair elections impossible. 
However, this should be kept secret for as long as possible to 
force acceptance of the alliance's constitutional proposals and 
motivate foreign financial support. 
  The document was drawn up at a meeting of the alliance's 
executive committee in Richards Bay on January 10. Alliance 
Chairman Rowan Cronje confirmed the document was authentic, but 
said it contained only scenarios which had never been adopted by 
alliance leaders. The January 10 meeting was called 
specifically to discuss the formation of an electoral alliance, 
as opposed to a mere negotiating alliance. It was decided 
against because "the differences in member organisations' 
policies are too great." 
  The executive considered three options -- participation, 
non- 
participation and doing nothing. The third option was shelved. 
The participation option was split into suboption: winning the 
election; preventing the ANC [African National Congress] getting 
a two-thirds majority; and "disrupting the election". All were 
possible, whether the interim constitution remained in place or 
was amended to suit the alliance. 
  The second option was to "abstain from participation in the 
election and secede from the RSA [Republic of South Africa] or 
create conditions under which it would be impossible to have a 
free and fair election." 
  It concluded that if members participated in the election 
individually, rather than as an alliance, "no member would 
obtain sufficient votes (20 percent) to elect a deputy president 
or to have a position of power through the number of members 
elected to the Cabinet, constitutional assembly and other organs 
of government at regional and/or national level". 
  Support from the Press and international community would be 
limited; and the alliance's supporters would either vote for the 
NP [National Party], to prevent the ANC getting a two-thirds 
majority, or for the ANC, to be on the winning side. It also 
warned that participation implied the alliance would have to 
"accept the results of the election and give credibility to the 
multiparty process." 
  The option of participating with the aim of disrupting the 
election would depend on the legal implications. However, it 
would also have "more freedom of movement for actions aimed at 
resistance. (This option does require further investigation." 
  The document states that should the alliance not 
participate, 
but take the option of disruption, "the full power of the 
government, the ANC and the TEC will be directed against it". 
The situation regarding the security forces and their attitude 
to the alliance could also influence the decision. 
  Secession becomes an option only if the country becomes 
ungovernable and the alliance will have to secure its own 
position in a situation similar to Angola and Mozambique, the 
document says. Alternatively it is an option if the alliance 
becomes a force feared by government and the ANC, who believe it 
cannot be subjugated by military force. This would make a 
peaceful secession possible. 
  Factors against an electoral alliance which could contain 
the 
ANC majority, or even win the election, included the "political 
cost for the Inkatha Freedom Party of being associated with the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front], the CP 
[Conservative Party] and the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement]" and Bophuthatswanan independence would have to be 
sacrificed.

  [Text] Urgent talks were resumed today in an effort to 
resolve the issue of a double ballot paper in the forthcoming 
election. The leadership of the Inkatha Freedom Party, the 
Pan-Africanist Congress, the Democratic Party, as well as 
representatives of Bophuthatswana and Ciskei, were involved in 
the discussions, which took place at Midrand. 
  A short while ago the parties said at a news conference that 
they consider the double ballot paper as a fundamental, 
nonnegotiable right. An action committee has been established 
to arrange a meeting with President F. W. de K lerk before 
Monday, at which the matter would be discussed further. 
  According to the negotiators, other steps could be applied 
to 
ensure a double ballot paper, should the current efforts fail. 
Earlier today the discussions had to be interrupted when a bomb 
threat was received, but the police were unable to find a bomb.

<F P=106> [Article by Ray Hartley and Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Text] President de Klerk yesterday dismissed suggestions 
that he had lost the support of large sections of the SADF 
[South African Defense Force], and vowed strong government 
action to put down any right-wing rebellion. 
  Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee added that the SADF had made 
contingency plans to deal with any possible violence from this 
quarter. 
  Their strong warnings follow the announcement by the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] on Thursday [10 February] 
that it would not participate in the forthcoming elections. 
  CP [Conservative Party] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said that, 
while the Afrikaner Volksfront still wanted to attain its 
volkstaat [homeland] through peaceful means, the right-wing 
front would be putting "pressure on the election in various 
ways." 
  Briefing journalists in Bloemfontein, Mr. de Klerk said: "I 
have no doubt about the basic loyalty of the security forces 
that, should any plans to disrupt the election come to fruition, 
contingency plans are ready. 
  "We will not and cannot allow minorities in South Africa to 
undermine the election process and to disrupt or derail that 
which clearly has the support of the majority of South Africans." 
  Mr. de Klerk warned that violent actions aimed at derailing 
the election would be countered with strong government action. 
  "If staying out means becoming involved in violence, we will 
act firmly within the framework of the law," he said. 
  Right-wing suggestions that a large section of the security 
forces would support a rebellion against the election were 
inaccurate. 
  "I believe the security forces have a proud track record of 
being loyal to the state ... of being non-partisan. I really 
don't think in any way there is a serious threat within the 
security forces," Mr. de Klerk said. 
  Elaborating on contingency plans, Mr. Coetsee said that the 
SADF had repossessed a large number of weapons issued to private 
citizens. 
  "Any weapons which have been issued for official use and 
which have been abused will summarily be withdrawn -- as a 
matter of fact we have already withdrawn a large number," he 
said. 
  Disciplinary steps would be taken against any member of the 
defence force who abused his position for political ends. 
  "The defence force has tightened up measures concerning the 
security of its bases and installations and to safeguard its 
armaments," Mr. Coetsee said. 
  "The defence force has launched a special communications 
plan 
to keep its members abreast of developments in the security and 
military field." 
  Subversion of the principle that the defence force serves 
the 
elected government of the day could lead to chaos and anarchy, 
he added. 
  Police spokesman Major Louis le Roux has confirmed special 
measures to secure police stations against political threat, 
reports Dirk van Heerden. 
  He declined to give details, but said a strategy had to be 
planned by station commanders and regional police chiefs. 
  The SAP [South African Police] was confident it could 
control 
any campaign against police stations. Task forces would be made 
available to stations under threat. 
  Major le Roux said the SAP was also confident it could 
control dissident policemen.

a boycott of the April election could lead to renewed 
international isolation. Addressing a meeting in Bloemfontein, 
President de Klerk said that a boycott or stayaway during the

<F P=106> [Report by Gallie van Rensburg] </F>
  [Text] President F.W. de Klerk and Mr. Clarence Makwetu, 
leader of the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC], met last night for 
the first time on South African soil -- and publicly crossed 
swords. Their little intimate gathering at a business forum in 
Johannesburg went off well. President de Klerk joked about it, 
and after his speech he walked up to Mr. Makwetu. 
  The two smiled broadly while shaking hands and posing for 
BEELD's photographer. They had met earlier in Swaziland. 
  Mr. de Klerk was the speaker at a business forum last night 
for the magazine ENTERPRISE. Mr. Makwetu had attended the 
meeting as a member of the magazine's committee. 
  President de Klerk apparently only became aware of Mr. 
Makwetu's presence in the audience when the announcer said he 
only wanted to say for the sake of Mr. de Klerk that Mr. Makwetu 
was also attending the occasion. 
  President de Klerk said this was an indication of the change 
in the country that the two of them were in the same room. Not 
so long ago the policy of the PAC had always been that it would 
not meet President de Klerk in South Africa. 
  In his speech President de Klerk attacked the ANC's [African 
National Congress] economic policy. He made a strong appeal for 
an economy based on private entrepreneurship. 
  During question time Mr. Makwetu said he had promised 
himself 
he would not ask a question. But he had to put into the correct 
perspective certain utterances by Mr. de Klerk. 
  He said the ANC's economic policy had not yet been 
implemented. No one, he said, could therefore say the ANC policy 
had already failed. Private entrepreneurship had failed through 
mismanagement. 
  What guarantee was there that free entrepreneurship will not 
again be mismanaged? 
  President de Klerk said in his reply he was looking forward 
to interesting discussions with Mr. Makwetu. South Africa did 
not implement true and full free entrepreneurship. A socialist 
policy had been applied in most cases, he said. 
  People in the predominantly black audience reacted to his 
speech with laughter, particularly when he spoke about the 
National Party's economic policy or when he attacked the ANC. 
  Mr. de Klerk said: "Your laughing is an indication that you 
are still caught up in the past. 
  "It is a far-reaching experience for me as a white man to 
say 
that we have a common fate with black people.

<F P=106> [Report by Paul Stober] </F>
  [Text] The MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN is this week able to print 
the 
details of a court case the government has kept hidden for five 
years, revealing that President F.W. de Klerk was not telling 
the full truth when he revealed South Africa's nuclear weapons 
programme last year. 
  The court records of the trial of Brigadier Johann Blaauw in 
1989 show that De Klerk's statement to parliament contained 
three direct lies about South Africa's collaboration with other 
countries in the nuclear programme. It also indicates that he 
underplayed the extent of the programme when he told of the 
existence of no more than six crude atomic bombs. The record 
also puts on display the level of corruption in the government 
in the 1980s, allowing former minister of mines Fanie Botha, a 
perpetual insolvent, to sit in parliament and the cabinet and 
even serve as leader of the House. Judge J. Friedman said that 
in order to hide his state of affairs Botha was "prepared to 
commit perjury, fraud and deceit; he was prepared to become 
involved in political chicanery of the most despicable kind ... 
he was prepared to lie to the prosecutor ... he was prepared to 
lie deliberately under oath ... no reliance can be placed on his 
evidence." 
  Botha was later jailed for one year. Transcripts of the 
trial confirm South Africa and Israel collaborated on the 
development of nuclear weapons -- and prove De Klerk lied on 
three counts: 

  -  He stated South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons 
technology or material from another country. 
  -  He stated that South Africa had never provided material to 
another country. 
  -  He stated that South Africa had never co-operated with 
another 
country in this regard. 

    The September 1989 Supreme Court judgment, in the "in 
camera" 
case of former South African Air Force [SAAF] Brigadier Blaauw, 
reveals startling details of South African-Israeli swaps of 
nuclear weapon technology and material and extensive 
collaboration between the two. Until now reporting on the 
judgment has been banned under the Nuclear Energy Act and the 
Criminal Procedure Act. As recently as last week, the 
government tried to block the story threatening the SUNDAY TIMES 
with an interdict if it printed it. 
  In October 1987, Blaauw was charged with attempting to 
extort 
mining concessions from Botha, by threatening to reveal that he 
was financially bankrupt. During the trail it emerged that 
Blaauw had in fact shored up Botha's finances with the help of 
the Israelis and brokered many of the key nuclear deals between 
South Africa and Israel. Blaauw was found not guilty on all 
charges. 
  After his retirement from the SAAF in 1975, Blaauw acted as 
a 
go-between for Israel and South Africa on military matters. In 
1976, he was approached by a member of an Israeli council 
involved in the clandestine purchase of nuclear materials and 
asked to obtain South African "yellow cake" for Israel. Yellow 
cake is an uranium oxide which, when enriched, can be used for 
the production of nuclear weapons. 
  Blaauw got agreement for the sale of 50 [metric] tons of 
yellow cake from the then prime minister B.J. Vorster, and the 
former head of the Bureau of State security, Hendrik van den 
Bergh, despite resistance from the then minister of mines, Piet 
Koornhof. Koornhof was replaced by Botha who was instructed to 
ensure the deal went through. Blaauw arranged a tour of Israeli 
military installations for Botha and the Israelis quickly struck 
up a good relationship with Botha. 
  Said the judgment: "Blaauw testified that there was, at that 
stage, a high degree of confidence developing between the South 
African and Israeli governments which involved the exchange of 
military technology, joint aeronautic ventures and the supply of 
`knowhow' by Israel to South Africa in regard to the manufacture 
of weaponry." 
  After the yellow cake deal went through, Blaauw was asked by 
Van den Bergh to see if Israel would supply tritium to South 
Africa. Tritium boosts the explosion of a nuclear bomb. The 
Israelis agreed to supply 30g of tritium to South Africa -- 
enough for 12 atomic bombs. In exchange, South Africa delivered 
two more consignments of yellow cake, of 50 [metric] tons and 
500 [metric] tons, to Israel. 
  Details of the transactions are recorded in CRITICAL MASS, a 
recently published book by William Burrows and Robert Windrem, 
which investigates the proliferation of nuclear weapons among 
developing countries. While the deals were going through, Botha 
slid into bankruptcy and his political career was threatened by 
a R[rand]1.7-million overdraft he owed Volkskas. But help was 
at hand. 
  Said the judgment: "The Israelis were interested in keeping 
Botha in the portfolio of mines because the yellow cake 
transactions had not yet fully materialised. There was every 
possibility of Botha becoming the minister of defence and they 
would have preferred Botha to hold that portfolio." 
  The Israelis gave Blaauw $1-million -- then worth R800,000 
-- 
as a "gift for what I had done for them." With the money, 
Blaauw gave Botha cash transfusions and kept him financially and 
politically alive. Blaauw and Botha fell out after Botha failed 
to deliver valuable mining concessions promised to Blaauw as a 
reward for his services to South Africa's nuclear programme,in 
July 1979. 
  In court, Botha alleged Blaauw attempted to force him to 
hand 
over the concessions by threatening to reveal details of Botha's 
illegal attempts to get evidence of corruption from his rivals 
in the struggle for the leadership of the National Party, after 
the fall of Vorster in 1979. 
  In his speech to parliament in March last year, when he 
announced he had ordered the dismantling of South Africa's 
nuclear arsenal, De Klerk baldly stated: "I wish to emphasise 
that at no time did South Africa acquire nuclear weapons 
technology or materials from another country, nor has it 
provided any to any other country, or co-operated with another 
country in this regard." 
  When confronted with the court records by the international 
London based magazine, AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, which first broke 
the story, the office of the state president replied: "South 
Africa did not acquire nuclear weapons technology from another 
country. Although tritium many be used in initiators of nuclear 
explosive devices, (although not in the devices produced by 
South Africa) it has many other commercial uses. South Africa 
has been active in the commercial exploitation of tritium for 
some time and has procured this material from various sources in 
the past." 
  Despite De Klerk's 1993 announcement, details of South 
Africa's nuclear programme remain shrouded in secrecy. Said ANC 
[African National Congress] science and technology head Roger 
Jardine: "They are prepared to give a tour of the complex but 
have never given details of the programme. A senior official 
once offered to tell me everything -- but only if I signed the 
Official Secrets Act."

  [Excerpts] The Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN today 
claimed that President F. W. de Klerk had told lies when he 
revealed details last year about South Africa's nuclear weapons 
program. The paper reported that the court records of the trial 
behind closed doors in 1989 of an air force officer, Brigadier 
Johan Blaauw, indicate that South Africa and Israel exchanged 
nuclear weapons technology, and that extensive cooperation had 
taken place between the two countries. [passage omitted] 
  President De Klerk said today that a statement on the matter 
will be released as soon as possible. In its reaction to the 
report, the Atomic Energy Corporation has denied that South 
Africa provided nuclear weapons technology to other countries. 
Chief Executive Officer Dr. (Waldo Schtupf) said in a statement 
that President de Klerk was correct in saying that South Africa 
had never exchanged nuclear weapons technology. He said tritium 
has several commercial uses and South Africa had purchased the 
material from various sources. 
  On the delivery of uranium oxide to Israel, he said South 
Africa has for a long time been involved in trading in the 
material and had delivered it to several countries, including 
some which do not manufacture nuclear weapons. 
  Cape Province Attorney General Frank Kahn said the police 
have been instructed to investigate the publication of documents 
relating to the trial, which had been held in camera.

  [Text] The satellite that allegedly detected a nuclear 
explosion by South Africa in 1979 is believed by some scientists 
to have malfunctioned, and it is clear from information received 
over the past nine months that the South African military 
establishment was not involved in the test. 
  This has been stated in Cape Town at the International 
Conference on Nuclear Policy by the president of the 
Washington-based Institute for Science and International 
Security, Mr. David Albright. The chief executive of the Atomic 
Energy Corporation, Dr. Stumpf, told delegates that even the 
most sophisticated instruments had not been able to detect a 
nuclear explosion, and that it was clear that South Africa had 
not been involved. 
  Mr. Roger Jardin of the ANC [African National Congress] said 
information would probably emerge soon to show that South Africa 
had collaborated with Israel in the alleged nuclear test.

  [Text] The African National Congress [ANC] of South Africa 
has stated unambiguously that it does not want a nuclear 
capability in South Africa. The head of the ANC's department of 
economic planning, Mr. Trevor Manuel, says the ANC has endorsed 
the Organization of African Unity's decision calling for the

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Mandela's Mining Rights Remarks `Imprudent' -- Johannesburg 
THE STAR in English on 11 February in a page-14 editorial 
describes African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson 
Mandela's remarks about the state reclaiming control of mineral 
rights from the mining houses as "imprudent." "Whether this was 
the intention or not, they revive fears of nationalisation and 
State control of the economy, with the consequent risk of a 
further flight of foreign capital." Mandela may have been 
restating a controversial point in the ANC's Reconstruction and 
Development Program (RDP), but "his tone was far from discreet." 
"Mandela's speech is likely to negate the reassurances he made 
after publication of the RDP, and also those given by the ANC 
spokesman on mining, Paul Jourdan." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Concern About Partisan Influence on Argus Editors -- 
"Journalists at THE STAR are apprehensive about what the change 
of ownership of Argus Newspapers will bring," notes a page-14 
editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 
February. "Their apprehension testifies to their independence 
under Anglo's ownership." The fact that Nelson Mandela has been 
a house guest of Tony O'Reilly, chief executive of Ireland's 
Independent Newspapers which acquired 31 percent of Argus 
Newspapers, and "has O'Reilly's ear need not imply that partisan 
influence will be exerted on the Argus's editors. Whether this 
is so will surely become apparent in the run-up to April's 
election and the early period of ANC rule." "The ANC's Pallo 
Jordan was right when he said his party's aim was to attract 
foreign investment, and that it could not be squeamish about 
which sectors foreign investors targeted." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Country May Be Headed for Civil War -- "It is now certain 
that the rightwing will boycott the elections," notes a page-8 
editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 11 February. 
"At worst we seem to be headed for a civil war. The rightwing 
and its bedfellows in the Freedom Alliance will do everything to 
thwart or make the elections difficult. The time has come for 
Government to act decisively against these groups." 
<H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>
  PAC To Acquire Watchdog Role -- "In the new parliament it is 
probably the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) and left-wing 
elements of the ANC who will most vocally express popular 
criticism of ANC leaders and their ability to deliver on the 
promises," points out a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg WEEKLY 
MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 11-17 February. "The major 
divide of South African politics, post-election, will probably 
be between the ANC and those on its left, notably the PAC, 
rather than those on its right. Most black voters are likely to 
see the PAC as the watchdog." 
  Sporadic Violence Likely From Right Wing -- A second 
editorial says the major question on everyone's lips this week 
is whether the likely nonparticipation of the Freedom Alliance 
in the elections is the "beginning of a slippery slide towards 
civil war." WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN believes a generalized 
right-wing rebellion is unlikely. "The white right is too 
isolated, too powerless, too divided and too poorly led for 
full, open revolt." Instead, there may be "an increase in the 
level of sporadic, targeted violence rather than more widespread 
revolt. This could make the election ugly, violent and messy, 
without necessarily preventing it from happening."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>
  Freedom Alliance Non-Participation In Elections 
Viewed--"After this week's deadlock in the negotiations between 
the ANC [African National Congress], the government, and the 
Freedom Alliance (FA), all indications are that important 
players like Inkatha and the Afrikaner Volksfront [National 
Front] (AVF) will not join the transitional process or take part 
in the April 27 election," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES 
in English on 13 February in a page-6 commentary. While 
conceeding that the alliance partners might be simply 
excercising "their democratic right," there is still reason for 
concern. The "FA cannot be allowed to pursue narrow political 
gains at the expense of the lives of millions of our people," 
what Inkatha leader Buthelezi calls "politics of resistance." 
All the alliance partners together, "never said a word when it 
was absolutely necessary .... today when people are about to 
taste their freedom, they make noises about a civil war." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Only Path for Right Wing is Negotiation -- The Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans on 8 February says in a page-8 editorial that 
"as Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said at the 
weekend, there are indeed many shortcomings in the right-wing's 
plan to unilaterally demarcate a right-wing homeland." "The 
major shortcoming, which he does not mention, is that the right 
wing has no territory which it can claim as its own, where they 
form the majority of the population." "There simply is no such 
region. And that is also the major shortcoming in their other 
alternative, which is to fight for the homeland. There is no 
homeland to fight for; no territory to defend; no invaders to 
repel; no identifiable enemy to shoot dead. Up to now the 
fighting has consisted mainly of blowing up power pylons and 
railway lines..." "In the final analysis the only way forward 
for the right wing remains negotiation, which means give and 
take." 
  Mandela's Tirades Against De Klerk `Unacceptable' -- A 
second 
editorial on the same page of the 8 February BEELD argues that 
"the manner in which Mr. Nelson Mandela continues with his 
personal attacks on the state president is unacceptable. His 
references to President de Klerk as `an unstable person' and a 
`weakling' overstep the bounds a civilized political leader 
should go in an election campaign. South Africa rightfully 
expects any political leader, who sees himself as a future head 
of state, to behave like one. Mr. Mandela's emotional tirade 
against President de Klerk excludes him from this category." 
"By increasingly playing the man rather than the ball, Mr. 
Mandela appears to be seeking a lightning conductor for 
criticism against aspects of his policy. We appeal for a 
raising of the level of political debate -- otherwise South 
Africans will in the future reap the fruits of these outbursts." 
  Negotiations Reach `Moment of Truth' -- The Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans on 9 February argues in a page-8 editorial 
that "the moment of truth has arrived for the Freedom Alliance's 
negotiations with the government and the ANC. With only a few 
days left before parties must register for the election, the 
negotiation cards are on the table, and it appears that the 
government and the ANC are prepared to make several more 
concessions in order to remove the alliance's objections to 
peaceful participation in the election." "Should the remaining 
stumbling blocks in the negotiations be removed, the Freedom 
Alliance, in the light of these concessions, will have no other 
honorable choice but to participate. Should they do so, they 
will be able, as honorable negotiators, to make a contribution 
to the political process in bringing about greater peace, 
stability, and prosperity for all in South Africa." 
<H6>  ILANGA </H6>
  Negotiations With ANC Viewed -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 7-9 
February in a page-4 editorial states that "the African National 
Congress' [ANC] decision to accept the double ballot system is 
commendable indeed as it is a step forward in resolving problems 
plaguing the negotiations on the future of this country." "Now 
we hear that because the ANC has agreed to the double ballot, it 
now wants the Freedom Alliance leaders to sign documents binding 
them to taking part in the 26-29 April election." "People 
should not get confused here, because there are other important 
proposals put forward by the Freedom Alliance that the ANC has 
said nothing about." "What is their story on the Zulu monarchy, 
kwaZulu, and the Zulu nation? There is still a lot they have 
not said anything about. So do not get confused!"

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  ANC Relationship With Irish Newspaper Group -- Johannesburg 
THE CITIZEN in English on 11 February in its page-6 editorial 
finds it "deplorable" that the Argus company decided to sell its 
major newspaper interests to Mr. Tony O'Reilly's Independent 
Newspapers Plc of Ireland. The paper notes that O'Reilly 
"hosted ANC [African National Congress] president Nelson Mandela 
at his home in the Bahamas at Christmas and New Year," and it 
would be "stretching credulity to the limit if we were asked to 
believe that they did not discuss the possibility of a bid by Mr 
O'Reilly for Argus. Or that Mr O'Reilly did not establish ahead 
of time that the takeover would not be blocked by the ANC when 
it became the government." THE CITIZEN believes O'Reilly's 
relationship with the ANC has "raised fears that he will 
influence the future policy of the group, making these 
newspapers even more willing to promote the ANC than they are 
now." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  FA Must Not Deny Others Right To Vote -- By embarking on an 
election boycott strategy, the Freedom Alliance (FA) members 
"risk being marginalised," warns a page-12 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 14 February. "Whether they 
like it or not, the new government will be regarded by the vast 
majority of South Africa and the outside world as legitimate and 
representative." Although the FA is entitled to pursue the 
boycott option, "the reverse applies equally." "People have the 
right to vote and provide South Africa with its first 
democratically elected government." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Election Nonparticipation FA Bargaining Chip -- Referring to 
a confidential Freedom Alliance document on strategic options 
"`leaked'" to the press, Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 
14 February in a page-4 editorial remarks that the alliance 
tactics "are absolutely dependent on using threatened 
nonparticipation as the main bargaining chip to obtain the best 
deal possible." However, the document shows that the alliance's 
members are "too divided on policy to contest the election as a 
united front," and that "secession is not an option." This 
leaves the alliance only the choice between "a passive boycott 
of the election and the `new South Africa', or an active 
campaign against them, with the latter more likely. It may be 
disruptive, but it offers little long-term security for alliance 
supporters." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Negotiations With Freedom Alliance `Exercise in Futility' -- 
"It is apparent from documentation recently made public that the 
sometimes desperate negotiations held with the Freedom Alliance 
have been an exercise in futility," begins a page-8 editorial in 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 14 February. "The trilateral 
talks between the FA, the ANC and the Government could not be 
allowed to succeed because it meant submission to the one thing 
the alliance's members feared most -- the April elections." 
"While it is owed to the people of this country to use all 
possible means to achieve a settlement, there comes a time when 
certain hard realities and challenges must be faced squarely." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  Detention-Without-Trial Remains--"The delay by the 
Transitional Executive Council (TEC) in implementing the repeal 
of the obnoxious section 29 of the Internal Security Act -- the 
detention-without- trial clause -- is profoundly disturbing," 
says a page-6 editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 10 
February. The TEC's law and order subcouncil "has not yet even 
considered the issue and Section 29, inexplicably, remains in 
force, in spite of Parliament's repeal of the measure. The lame 
excuses offered raise serious questions about the commitment of 
the major TEC parties, the NP [National Party] and the ANC 
alliance, in upholding civil liberties."

  [Text] Djibouti, 9 Feb (AFP) -- Yesterday afternoon, an 
Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 on a domestic flight was hijacked 
to Djibouti by two individuals. The two finally gave themselves 
up to the Djibouti authorities after releasing the 113 people on 
board the plane, it was learned from airport sources. 
  The plane, which was operating a flight between Bahr Dar 
(western Ethiopia) and Addis Ababa, landed at Djibouti 
International Airport around 1545, where after nearly four hours 
of negotiations the 105 passengers and eight crew members were 
released. The hijackers, who are said to be Ethiopians of 
Amhara origin, agreed to release their hostages and surrender 
after they were assured of being given political asylum, it was 
learned from reliable sources. 
  The negotiations were led on the Djibouti side by Interior 
Minister Harbi Farah Idris and Transport Minister Ahmed Waberi 
in the presence of the Red Cross representative in Djibouti. 
The Ethiopian ambassador to Djibouti also closely followed the 
negotiations at the airport, the same sources said. The media 
was kept out of the meeting and the Djibouti authorities 
maintained a total blackout on the affair until it ended. The 
plane was expected to leave the Djibouti airport around 2100 for 
Addis Ababa with all the 113 passengers and crew members.

  [Text] A state of emergency has been declared in seven 
areas of the Northern Region. This forms part of measures by 
government to restore law and order to the areas engaged in 
ethnic conflict which has resulted in loss of lives and 
property. In a statement to Parliament today, the minister of 
interior, Colonel Osei-Wusu, reiterated government's 
determination to maintain peace in affected areas. 
  [Begin recording] While affirming its commitment to the 
resolution of the conflict through dialogue and negotiation, 
government's immediate concern is to enforce a cessation of 
hostilities and to restore order to enable people go about their 
day to day business. Mr. Speaker, the president, having 
considered the grave dimension that the communal violence has 
taken, has -- in exercise of the powers conferred on him under 
Clause 1 of Article 31 of the Constitution -- declared a state 
of emergency in the following areas of the Northern Region: 
  1. Tamale Municipality; 
  2. Saboba Chereponi District 
  3. Yendi District 
  4. Zabzugu Tatali District, 
  5. Nanumba District 
  6. Gushiago Karaga District, and 
  7. East Gonja District. 
  Mr. Speaker, by Clause 3 of Article 31, Parliament is 
required to decide whether the proclamation of state of 
emergency should remain in force or be revoked. The president 
is of the considered view that the situation requires the 
declaration of state of emergency and I call upon Parliament to 
approve the proclamation. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] yesterday tried to overrun the capital of 
Quipungo District in Huila Province. Eyewitnesses say about 
2,000 armed men entered the town firing shots and shouting that 
they wanted to capture Kundi Payhama, who was resting there. 
However, the Angolan Armed Forces and the civilian defense 
repelled the attack. Once again the people most affected were 
civilians. According to preliminary reports 14 civilians were 
wounded, two seriously -- a child and a woman aged 10 and 27, 
respectively. According to the doctor in duty at the hospital, 
it will be difficult to save their lives. [passage omitted] 
  The objective of the attack was to capture General Kundi 
Payhama, who was resting in Quipungo, his home area. The rebels 
entered the town, firing shots, and continued shouting that they 
wanted to capture him alive. They were firmly repelled however, 
leaving behind 30 dead comrades. They had no other alternative 
but to flee. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Ann Eveleth and Farouk Chothia] </F>
  [Text] In a significant hardening of his position, Zulu 
monarch King Goodwill Zwelithini has demanded the "complete 
restoration of the Zulu kingdom" in talks with President F.W. de 
Klerk. Sources close to the hush-hush encounters say the king 
has called for a sovereign Zulu state according to pre-1838 
boundaries. This would encompass all of Natal, including 
kwaZulu, and would stretch from the Drakensberg mountains to the 
sea and from Mozambique to the Umzimvubu River in the south. 
  The demand runs directly contrary to speculation that the 
monarch would adopt a less political role with the imminent 
demise of the kwaZulu homeland, in a bid to secure his position 
under a new dispensation. 
  With the failure this week of the trilateral talks between 
the government, ANC [African National Congress] and Freedom 
Alliance to reach agreement on outstanding constitutional 
issues, the king has lost interest in remaining part of the new 
South Africa, the sources say. 
  Arguing that the new dispensation would herald not only a 
new 
government, but a new state as well, one source noted: "Before 
conquest by Britain, the Zulus were a sovereign nation. Now 
that the British are no longer ruling South Africa, we are not 
obliged to remain part of it." 
  Conspicuously absent from last week's pow-wow between 
Zwelithini and De Klerk was kwaZulu chief minister Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi. Buthelezi has clearly begun a strategic retreat from 
the political frontline -- in the hope that an anti-election 
call from his nephew will have wider appeal among Zulus. By 
raising the spectre of a UDF [United Democratic Front]-style 
campaign to boycott elections with the backing of a royal 
decree, Zwelithini has sharpened the battle for his allegiance. 
  The ANC's decision to place its deputy secretary general, 
Jacob Zuma, at the top of its Natal electoral list was in part a 
strategy to win over the king, whom ANC president Nelson Mandela 
last year lauded as the king of all South Africans." But 
efforts by Zuma have so far failed to produce a 
Mandela-Zwelithini indaba [meeting]. Instead, when Zwelithini 
decided to enter the heart of the debate, he arranged for a 
private meeting with De Klerk. 
  Sources say De Klerk went further than Zuma's promise to 
seek 
a constitutional position for the monarch by hinting that a 
post-election arrangement could secure him the constitutional 
monarchy of South Africa. Zwelithini is said to have baulked at 
the suggestion. 
  Said one source: "(Zwelithini) looks over the border at 
Swaziland and Lesotho and says: `They were far smaller than 
(the Zulus) in my grandfather's time and now they have sovereign 
kingdoms. Why should I settle for second best?'" Among 
Zwelithini's representatives in the talks are IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] chief executive officer Joe Matthews and Prince 
Gideon Zulu. The government is represented by Constitutional 
Development Minister Roelf Meyer and his Foreign Affairs 
colleague, Pik Botha. 
  In the clearest reflection that Zwelithini's demands have 
created a dilemma for the ANC and government alike, Meyer said 
this week in an SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
interview that the king's demands were tantamount to a call for 
secession. He declined to give details. A few hours later, 
Mandela responded by calling upon the king to meet him rather 
than De Klerk, who would not be in power after elections. 
  ANC sources this week claimed the king had already agreed to 
meet a delegation of its Natal leaders, but that Zuma's absence 
on an overseas visit had delayed the encounter. 
  Given the probability that the IFP will, together with its 
allies, boycott the coming election, the king's move to centre 
stage is a shrewd strategy. Inkatha leader Buthelezi and his 
negotiators have exhausted their options for obtaining 
concessions from the government and the ANC. 
  Now, faced with the task of organising an effective boycott, 
the party is playing its trump card, observers say. The 
exclusion of the word "kwaZulu" from the interim constitution 
has strengthened Buthelezi's argument that the ANC and the 
government cannot be trusted with the fate of the Zulu nation, 
sources say. 
  It is unclear how Zwelithini plans to rule such a kingdom, 
but it is likely that Buthelezi would retain his position as the 
"traditional prime minister to the Zulu monarch."

  [Text] Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister George Bartlett 
says the accusation by ANC [African National Congress] President 
Nelson Mandela that the state transferred its mineral rights to 
mining companies was devoid of all truth. 
  Mr. Bartlett explained that mineral rights in the country 
had 
always belonged to the state or the private sector, and that 
recent legislation had brought no change in terms of ownership. 
He said that with the implementation of the Minerals Act of 
1991 the state's provisos concerning certain mineral rights had 
lapsed in order to give recognition to the lawful owners of the 
mineral rights involved in terms of common law. He stressed 
that there had not been any change of ownership.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency Cyprien Ntaryamira, our 
country's president, today made his first trip abroad with a 
visit to Tanzania for talks with his Tanzanian counterpart, Ali 
Hassan Mwinyi, on the problem of Burundian refugees in Tanzania. 
President Ntaryamira left by air this morning and returned this 
afternoon. [passage omitted] 
  The visit of our head of state, His Excellency Cyprien 
Ntaryamira, is taking place just after the newly formed 
government was reshuffled. Opposition parties rejected the 
composition of the first government as inconsistent with 
previous agreements. We asked Joseph Nzeyimana of the Rally for 
Democracy and Economic and Social Development party, who is now 
minister of commerce and industry in the newly formed 
government, for his comments: 
  [Begin recording] [Nzeyimana] I would like to tell those 
listening to me that what the child of a king cries for is 
always granted by God. That is what happened yesterday. We 
fought for peace and respect for agreements. That is what we 
got. You know that the head of state promised that he would 
form a government to bring Burundians together. We were not 
after posts because we already had them. We were not after 
wealth. We wanted to be in the government so that we could work 
for peace, so that we could fight for those who cannot [passage 
indistinct]. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I want to ask you about the men 
and women members of the new government: Do you think you will 
be able to understand each other in day-to-day activities? 
  [Nzeyimana] We will have to understand one another, 
otherwise we would be heading for disaster. [passage indistinct] 
[end recording] 
  Another person who commented on the government is the leader 
of the Guarantor of the Freedom of Speech in Burundi, Dr. 
Alphonse Rugambarara, who is now the minister of youth, culture, 
and sports. 
  [Begin recording] [Rugambarara] The government that has just 
been formed satisfies us to some extent because the head of 
state and the prime minister noticed that we were not happy 
about what [words indistinct]. They have just changed that. We 
are happy about this, but there are still some minor problems. 
However, if people are willing, the problem will be removed. 
It concerns the communal administration. You know that 
security matters are dealt with by the Interior Ministry. Many 
people have died in this country; they have killed one another. 
We must, therefore, be fully aware of who should deal with the 
communal administration. Things are still not very clear, but 
we think that they will be clarified for us so that we can work 
effectively. [passage omitted]

  [Text] There has been a government reshuffle in Burundi 
just two days after the previous government was appointed. The 
opposition considers the new government to be based on a 
national consensus. Nicolas Mayugi is the leader of UPRONA 
[Party of National Unity and Progress]. He spoke to Monique Mas: 
  [Begin recording] [Mayugi] If every Burundian can now relate 
to this government, it is largely because the last government 
was perceived as the government of a party that had just won. 
Today, the government is perceived as a government that brings 
people together. 
  [Mas] Is it seen as such by the parties that lost the 
elections? 
  [Mayugi] Yes, we are in a crisis, and we are trying to come 
out of it. I think that we can return to concepts like winning 
and losing later. Now, we need to rebuild our country and bring 
back peace. Perhaps this is also why the political parties have 
agreed to a political truce. [end recording]

  [Text] Laurent Gbagbo, secretary general of the Ivorian 
Popular Front [FPI], who had been silent since the death of 
President Houphouet-Boigny, broke his silence yesterday at a 
news conference at Assonvon Hotel, Yopougon district, Abidjan. 
Addressing the national and international media, the FPI leader 
touched on the current political, economic, and social problems 
facing our country. These include the devaluation of the CFA 
franc and its effects--whether good or bad--on us all; the 
political transitional period following the death of the first 
Ivorian president; some sections of our country's Constitution, 
especially the point concerning the succession issue; as well as 
other topics such as the election issue. Now let us listen to 
Laurent Gbagbo reaffirm his party's stand on Article 11 of the 
Constitution. 
  [Begin Gbagbo recording] The FPI is definitely against 
Article 11. It is against the current application of the 
article. It is against Article 11 today and tomorrow. It is 
also against the ideology on which Article 11 is based. 
Republican power is not given out in hereditary manner. Power 
should be won and regulations must be defined for the conquest 
of power. There is something fishy about the fact that the 
authorities, after the 1990 events, rushed to rearrange this 
Article 11, so we must stand against it. We opposed it, we are 
still opposed to it, and we will still be opposed to it in 
future. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Liberian civilians are once again taking flight in 
fear as a result of fighting and bringing with them horrendous 
and vivid reports. Several thousand Liberians are said to be 
heading toward the port of Buchanan in the Grand Bassa County, 
trying to escape skirmishes between Charles Taylor's NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and the organization 
calling itself the Liberian Peace Council. These skirmishes 
between the NPFL and the Liberian Peace Council have reportedly 
been going on for nearly three months in southeastern Liberia. 
This is in the midst of the stalled peace process and the 
continued ineffectiveness of the Transitional Council. From 
Monrovia, Nii Anartey Allison telexed this report. 
  Cecil Gillaume, a medical coordinator of the French charity 
Medecin Sans Frontieres at Compound No. 2 in eastern Grand Bassa 
County, said the displaced were without food and safe drinking 
water. She added: Many die each day from diarrhea, malaria, 
and other diseases. She said that several thousand others were 
trapped in riverside villages by landmines planted west of the 
St. John River which crosses Grand Bassa County. Ms. Guillaume 
added that it was difficult to reach them with any aid though 
some of them are managing to arrive at Compound No. 2. 
  Several thousand others fleeing fighting in Liberia 
Agricultural Company area have been trickling into Buchanan for 
fear of imminent fighting two weeks after the Liberia Peace 
Council overrun the area. More than 2,000 people have entered 
the port city of Buchanan in the past week. The city is already 
sheltering at least 10,000 displaced people. The refugees said 
they had to leave behind them several dozen others, mostly the 
sick and elderly as bullets whisked passed them. They said they 
had seen bullet-riddled bodies littering the bushes during their 
escape to Buchanan. People are very frightened, and one man 
told me that, on seeing an unused bullet near to his tent, he 
shouted, bullet, bullet, and other refugees rushed to the scene 
and used a shovel to dispose of it. 
  Another refugee described the situation in the rebels' 
enclave as appalling and added that the two rebel sides were 
subjecting the people to harassment, flogging, and forced 
conscription. He added: Anyone who speaks good English or looks 
clean is a target. I was afraid to fight back because they 
would kill me, another panic- stricken refugee said, explaining 
how NPFL rebels had taken away his 13-year-old son. A local aid 
agency, Medical Emergency Relief Cooperative International, or 
MERCI, has posted emergency mobile teams at all seven refugee 
entry points to deal with the influx of refugees into Buchanan. 
We are now treating per day two to 300 cases of diarrhea, 
malnutrition, and bullet wounds. This was told to me by Dr. 
Mohamed Sylla, head of MERCI's Buchanan operations.

  [Text] Niamey, 13 Feb (AFP) -- About 100 eminent 
traditional chiefs and community religious leaders from the Air 
(north of Niger), launched an appeal in Agadez (750 km northwest 
of Niamey) on 12 February "for a true resumption" of 
negotiations between the Niger Government and the Tuareg 
rebellion. 
  At the end of the meeting between the traditional chiefs, 
the 
Sultan of the Air, El Hadj Ibrahim Oumarou, in a statement 
broadcast on national television, called on Tuareg people to 
show "civic-mindedness and patriotism " in order for them to 
give a "precious contribution" to the settlement of the Tuareg 
conflict. 
  He also regretted the current economic situation that is 
"particularly preoccupying" in northern Niger and asked "all 
countries who are friends of Niger such as France, Algeria, 
Nigeria, and Burkina Faso" to give "full support" to a 
definitive return of peace in the north of country. 
  At the beginning of the month, the four movements of the 
rebellion, grouped within the Coordination of the Armed 
Resistence, agreed to resume dialogue with the Niger government 
and announced the holding of a meeting in Ouagadougou (Burkina 
Faso), with no date fixed as yet. 
  On 5 February, a French diplomat, Mr. Jean-Francois Nodinot, 
was appointed "mediator" in the conflict, which has left 91 
people dead since November 1991.

  [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, said today 
in Abuja that West African countries involved in finding 
solutions to the Liberian crisis should adopt a more united 
approach. Gen. Abacha said this at the opening of bilateral 
talks between Nigeria and Sierra Leone. The delegationfrom 
Sierra Leone is led by the country's head of state, Captain 
Valentine Strasser. Statehouse correspondent, Chris Mbu, 
reports on the meeting: 
  [Begin recording] [Mbu] General Abacha said that ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] is now passing through a critical stage of its operations 
but, (?as he says), peace and stability is being restored in 
Liberia on the basis of the Cotonou Peace Accord. Gen. Abacha 
pleaded with West African countries to come together and put 
pressure on the warring groups in the Liberian crisis to make 
them understand the need for peace in Liberia. He said that 
time had come for the sacrifices being made by countries 
involved in the ECOMOG operations to be justified by way of 
lasting peace in Liberia. The head of state then called for 
support for efforts coming from outside Africa in aid of ECOMOG 
operations in Liberia, citing the United Nations efforts as 
example. 
  [Abacha] The interest that is being shown by the United 
Nations is something which is very, very positive and it has got 
to be encouraged. Countries that [word indistinct] not only in 
the subregion, but also in particular in Liberia wish to 
cooperate to ensure the success of the accord. 
  [Mbu] Gen. Abacha then assured Capt. Strasser of Nigeria's 
willingness to continue assisting the Sierra Leone which, he 
said, has been experiencing some destabilizing fallout from the 
Liberian crisis. The Sierra Leone shares borders with Liberia. 
On the issue of ties between the two countries, he said that 
Nigeria and the Sierra Leone will explore ways of widening the 
scope and strengthening existing relations. 
  The Sierra Leonean head of state, Capt. Strasser, reacting 
to 
some of the issues raised by Gen. Abacha, expressed concern that 
seven months after the Cotonou Peace Accord, as he put it, no 
major advancement has been made towards lasting peace in 
Liberia. He said that in Sierra Leone, questions are now being 
raised about the sense in deploying national resources for 
ECOMOG operations when Sierra Leone is faced with what he 
referred to as serious security problems. All that 
notwithstanding, he assured Gen. Abacha that the Sierra Leone 
will continue to maintain its presence in the ECOMOG but with 
Nigeria assisting in tackling the country's security problems. 
  Delegations of the two countries later went into a 
closed-door session. The Sierra Leonean head of state who flew 
into Abuja morning has since left for home. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Nigeria's new military government seems to have no 
qualms about using its powers of arrest. If reports in today's 
state-owned press are to be believed, Shehu Musa Yar'Adua was 
one of 23 presidential candidates disqualified from taking part 
in last year's presidential elections, and while he supported 
the scrapping the election results last June and is himself a 
member of a previous Nigerian military government, he is opposed 
to the Army's takeover last November, and it looks as if that's 
what got him into trouble, as Sola Odunfa reports from Lagos: 
  [Begin recording] There is no official confirmation of 
General Yar'Adua's arrest, but a local newspaper in Kaduna 
quoted members of his family as saying that he was picked up at 
his residence in Kaduna on Saturday [12 February] shortly after 
his arrival from a business trip abroad. The federal 
government-owned DAILY TIMES in Lagos also reported that the 
general was being detained in Kaduna. 
  Normally, the state security service does not announce 
arrests and detention of people. Information of such action 
comes from the detainee's families and, only on very few 
occasions, from government spokesmen. In this case, the press 
office at the Presidency in Abuja said this afternoon that it 
could neither confirm nor deny the general's arrest. 
  Hints of possible government action against Gen. Yar'Adua 
were given two weeks ago by Information Minister Jerry Gana in a 
public speech in Makurdi. He was quoted as saying that Gen. 
Yar'Adua fled the country because he appreciated the 
consequences of the statement which he made at a press 
conference in Lagos. The minister described the statement as 
offensive. Addressing journalists in Lagos, Gen. Yar'Adua has 
criticized the apparently indefinite tenure of the new military 
regime of General Sani Abacha and suggested that it should not 
extend beyond this year. He also said that the forthcoming 
constitutional conference should be a sovereign national 
conference rather than one whose decisions would be subject to 
approval by the Provisional Ruling Council. 
  A day after the conference, the police reminded politicians 
of the ban on political activities and warned them to stop 
making further statements on political issues or risk arrest. 
Gen. Yar'Adua's arrest and detention will signal to other 
politicians that the warning should be taken seriously. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Petroleum and Mineral Resources Minister Chief Don 
Etiebet has concluded his official visits to Saudi Arabia and 
Qatar, where he sought to promote Nigeria's proposals for the 
forthcoming conference of the OPEC. Chief Etiebet, in the 
course of his trip, met and held talks with the Qatari minister 
of energy and industries, Shaykh 'Abdallah al-'Atiyah, who is 
the current OPEC president. Both ministers are reported to have 
agreed on measures to check the sliding oil prices which have 
resulted in a drop of about $4 in the price of Nigeria's Bony 
Light crude. 
  In an international press briefing, Chief Etiebet described 
his talks with Qatar's minister of energy as successful: 
  [Begin Etiebet recording] We resolved to tackle these areas 
with a view to making sure that overproduction is reduced to its 
minimum if not completely eradicated, and quota arrears are 
meant to make sure that what will come out in our meeting on 
March 25th will be enough to bring up the price to a comfortable 
level for the producers again. We are very serious and very 
determined in this area. I would not like to read or say 
exactly the figures but we definitely think that we should work 
from anything from between five and 10 percent until production 
(?goes up). [end recording] 
  Chief Etiebet also paid a courtesy call on the Amir of 
Qatar. 
  [Begin Etiebet recording] Our head of state, General Sani 
Abacha, asked me to (?deliver a message) and convey his best 
regards, his greetings, and to congratulate you and your 
sovereign (?noblemen) of your country, which is seen as one of 
the richest and most peaceful in the world. [end recording] 
  (?Later), the minister and his delegation went to Riyadh, 
Saudi Arabia. While in Saudi Arabia, Chief Etiebet held talks 
with his Saudi counterpart, Muhyi-al-Din Nazir. The minister 
and his delegation have since returned to the country.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Presidency in Lome on 14 February; </F>
read by Aouzi Tshinpetse] 
  [Text] The president of the Republic was informed early 
this afternoon about the death of three persons, including 
Gaston Edeh Aziandouvo, legislator elect of the Action Committee 
for Renewal [CAR] in the second Yoto constituency. He was 
kidnapped on Sunday, 13 February, at the environs Agoenyive. 
  The president of the Republic expresses his indignation at 
this odious, gratuitous, and criminal act which he condemns 
vehemently. The head of state is asking the government to set up 
a commission of inquiry to identify, arrest, and bring to book 
those responsible for this crime. The president of the Republic 
expresses his condolences to the families of the victims. 
  In the afternoon of Sunday, 13 February, four persons, 
including Gaston Edeh Aziandouvo who was going for a cold drink 
at LE CARMEN bar in the outskirts of Agoenyive, was allegedly 
approached by two individuals in military attire. These two 
individuals seized the vehicle in which the four persons were 
and drove them to an unknown destination. 
  This morning, 14 February, the National Gendarmerie 
continued 
its investigations to find the lost persons and their 
kidnappers, but I was informed this afternoon that three of the 
four persons, including Mr. Aziandouvo, were found dead and 
burned in their vehicle in the environs of Agoenyive. The 
fourth person fled. 
  The government vigorously condemns these acts of violence 
that are liable to jeopardize the peaceful climate that is 
indispensable for the smooth running of the electoral process 
that will lead to putting in place the democratic institutions. 
The government will do all in its power to look for those 
responsible for these criminal acts. They have refused to use 
democratic means in achieving power and resorted to terror to 
satisfy their political ambitions. The government will adopt 
every measure to preserve public order, security of persons and 
goods before, during, and after the proclamation of the results 
of the second round of the legislative elections. 
  The security forces will look out for those responsible for 
the criminal acts. All those who threaten such acts contrary to 
peaceful, brotherly, and tolerant democracy to which all the 
Togolese people aspire; these antidemocratic citizens will be 
hunted down and brought to justice.

<F P=106> ["Clarification" by the Rally of the Togolese People in Lome </F>
on 14 February; read by Aouzi Tshinpetse] 
  [Text] Using vigilance, tolerance, and adhesion to 
democratic behavior and gesture as watch words before the first 
round of the legislative elections; goaded on by the concern to 
see the end of the legislative elections in peace and serenity; 
surprised by the repetition of methods used in 1991 by the 
Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] -- notably threats, 
intimidation, calls for tribal hatred, and violenct acts -- it 
is with great disappointment that the Rally of the Togolese 
People [RPT] listened to Edor's statement on behalf of the CAR 
on national and international media. Considering that the 
Togolese opposition has always been the first to cry thief and 
assassin as soon as it has done something condemnable, the RPT 
would like to make the following clarification: 
  1. We have concrete proof which confirms 24 constituencies 
for the second round of the legislative elections were put at 
the disposal of the CAR militiamen. 
  2. The traditional chiefs of the southern region of the 
country, concerned with the need to make peace and harmony 
prevail among ethnic groups in their territories and surprised 
to see these militiamen propagating tribal hatred, drew the 
government's attention to the situation. 
  3. The RPT leaders were informed about the situation by 
their 
activists and the people with great precision. 
  4. In order to avoid frigtening the people and inciting the 
anger of the grassroots activists, the RPT leaders preferred to 
manage this situation by ensuring government authorities in 
charge of the security of men and goods would secure the 
implementation of the laws in force. 
  The RPT considers the CAR communique a serious accusation 
and 
a provocation based on misinformation. The RPT would like to 
warn the CAR leaders that fraud, cheating, intimidation, 
threats, violence, and sabotage with which they hindered the 
presidential elections and the first round of the legislative 
elections will not go unnoticed. 
  7. [as heard] The RPT, attached to the ideals of peace, 
serenity, brotherhood, solidarity, and harmonious cohabitation 
among all ethnic groups, will do all in its power for 
brotherhood, national unity, territorial integrity, and improved 
condition of citizens to prevail. 
  Finally, the RPT would like to reassure the people concerned 
by the 20 February legislative elections that no one can prevent 
them from enjoying their civic rights without facing the full 
rigors of the laws in force. 
  For the RPT, the national chairman of the campaign 
committee, 
  Signed, Ayite Gachin Mivedor.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi has, 
with immediate effect, stopped any cooperation whatsoever 
between the ruling party, KANU [Kenya African National Union], 
and the FORD [Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]-Kenya 
party. And, at the same time, he warned of dire consequences 
for any KANU leader that will be seen to be cooperating with any 
officials from the FORD-Kenya party. 
  The president explained that when KANU accepted to cooperate 
with FORD-Kenya, it was because he knew the political policies 
of the late FORD-Kenya leader Jaramogi Oginga Odinga well, and 
Odinga too understood President Moi's policies. However, the 
president added that recent events and remarks by some 
FORD-Kenya officials have completely disqualified them from that 
cooperation. President Moi was speaking at the Kericho Show 
Ground when he officially opened this year's Kericho 
Agricultural Show. 
  The president further said that for the past two years he 
had 
been eagerly watching the outbusts and actions of some officials 
from FORD-Kenya and had come to the conclusion that those 
leaders had lost a sense of direction. He said KANU stood for 
peace and stability and cannot, therefore, enter into any 
cooperation with the party that excels in abuses. President 
Moi, who is also the president of the ruling party KANU, said he 
was definitely annoyed by the insults directed at him but 
restrained himself because of his great love for the children of 
this country. He, however, added that tolerance has a limit.

  [Excerpts] After failing in its harmful activities in 
Somalia, the UN Operation Somalia II [UNOSOM] wants to illegally 
collect taxes at the country's ports and airports to the 
detriment of the objective of the struggling people, Abdi Hasan 
Awaleh Abdi Qaydid, chairman of the Somali National Alliance 
[SNA] high committee for internal affairs, said in an address to 
a rally at the 1 July Independence Square in Mogadishu. 
[passage omitted] 
  First, the rally was addressed by Abdulkadir Haji Mohamed, 
alias Luga-Dhere, member of the United Somali Congress [USC] 
Central Committee, who conveyed greetings to the people from 
Mohamed Farah Aidid, SNA and United Somali Congress chairman. 
He briefed the rally on new developments that occurred during 
the chairman's visits to some countries abroad. Luga-Dhere also 
said that UNOSOM has failed to trade on the Somali name to 
achieve its objectives. In conclusion, he said the world had 
been told clearly that UNOSOM would be held responsible for any 
problem that it might bring to the Somali people. 
  Abdi Hasan Awale Abdi Qaydid said Admiral Jonathan Howe must 
shoulder the responsibility for his problems. He said the 
Somali people will never forget the destruction Howe has brought 
upon them. He appealed to the world to bring him to justice. 
Abdi Qaydid also spoke of the illegal export of wild animals 
through the country's ports and airports. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nairobi, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Two Red Cross groups have 
withdrawn from Hiran region of Somalia, following hand grenade 
attacks on two non-governmental organisations' (NGOs) compounds 
in Beledweyne on February 9. 
  In a statement released here on Monday, the International 
Federation of the Red Cross and the German Red Cross 
(Federation/GRC) said that after the first attack, they had 
decided to pull out all NGO expatriates in the region, except 
the Federation's delegate and a respresentative of the 
International Medical Corps (IMC). 
  But the IMC and the Federation/GRC also pulled out the two 
on 
February 12 after another attack was aimed at the residence 
where they were staying. 
  Shortly before their departure on Saturday, the head of 
Federation Somalia delegation in Nairobi was informed by IMC 
through their Nairobi representative that the head of 
Federation/GRC sub-delegation in Beledweyne was also being held 
hostage and that his life was being threatened. 
  But he was released after frantic efforts by Federation/GRC 
and the Somali Red Crescent Society, and has now been flown to 
Nairobi.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Presidency in Ndjamena on 12 </F>
February] 
  [Text] A delegation led by Civil Service Minister Wadal 
Abdelkader Kamougue and accompanied by Mr. (Ali Mahamad Guem), 
diplomatic adviser to the Presidency of the Republic, will leave 
for Tripoli, Libya, on 14 February. The mission of the 
delegation is to hand over a message from President Idriss Deby 
to the Guide of the Libyan Revolution, Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi. 
  The message is apparently related to the implementation of 
the verdict of the International Court of Justice on the 
demarcation of borders between Libya and Chad. The departure of 
this delegation is more proof of the willingness of the Chadian 
Government to open a new era in relations between the two 
countries based on mutual trust and friendship. 
  Nonetheless, reliable sources report that, since the 
publishing of the verdict of the International Court, an 
important reinforcement of Libyan troops is reported in Aouzou 
and abductions are also reported of Chadians living in Libya and 
the reactivation of political groups hostile to the Chadian 
Government. This unfriendly attitude is a subject of concern 
for Chad, the communique concluded.

  [Text] Colonel Idriss Deby, currently on a private visit to 
France, this afternoon held talks with his French counterpart 
Francois Mitterrand. The devaluation of the CFA franc and its 
consequences, backup measures to mitigate the negative effects 
of this valuation, as well as the verdict of the International 
Court of Justice of The Hague were undoubtedly at the center of 
the discussions between the two heads of state. 
  It must also be noted that President Deby also held talks 
with French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin.

According to information received by LA LIBRE BELGIQUE, on 26

the Zaire River. We have not received confirmation of this 
information, but an investigation by the criminal investigation

  In its issue of 3 February, the Paris-based LA LETTRE DU

Israeli instructors have just set up in Brazzaville for 16 
months, in exchange for a payment of US$49 million. The first 
instalment at least has already been paid into a Swiss bank 
account." According to LA LETTRE DU CONTINENT, it was the 
Israeli ambassador in Kinshasa, Shlomo Avital, who had "taken 
care" of finalizing this "assistance agreement," although the 
contract is officially a private one. 
  LA LETTRE DU CONTINENT also indicates that "two Israeli 
advisers have joined the presidential staff in an individual 
capacity. One of them is a financial adviser and a member of 
the delegation currently visiting the IMF and the World Bank in 
Washington. The other is a traditional habitat adviser.... 
They have joined the president's new security adviser...."

  [Text] Brazzaville, 11 Feb (AFP) -- Twenty-five former 
Israeli secret service agents are set to start training a team 
of bodyguards for Congo President Pascal Lissouba at Aubeville, 
a remote town 400 kilometers (249 miles) from the capital, 
military sources here said Friday [11 February]. The former 
Army or security services officers will be joined by a further 
30 Israeli recruits at the end of the month to "train 
specialists in urban guerrilla warfare," according to Israeli 
newspaper YEDI'OT AHARONOT. 
  Aged between 21 and 27, the mercenaries have been lured to 
the West African troublespot by wages of between 2,000 and 2,500 
dollars a month. Their job description is "advisers" whose role 
will be to "protect democracy." 
  The Congo has entered the second week of a fragile peace 
following a ceasefire between armed factions supporting Lissouba 
and main opposition leader Bernard Kolelas at the end of January. 
  The Israeli mercenaries were recruited on the strength of a 
50-million-dollar military accord between the Israeli arms firm 
Levdan and the Congo Government. 
  YEDI'OT AHARONOT has named Levdan chairman Reserve General 
Ze'ev Zakharin, 45, who trained the pro-Israeli militia in 
southern Lebanon, and two of his aides, reserve colonels 
Yisra'el Ramot and Hayim Boru, as the chief recruiting officers. 
Eli, a 26-year-old former commando, told the daily that Boru, 
his one-time superior in Lebanon, contacted him two months ago. 
"We agreed to meet in a Tel Aviv cafe where he explained the 
details of the mission after offering a salary of 2,000 dollars 
a month. Living conditions are very tough in the Congo." "The 
mercenaries live under canvas under military discipline, but 
Colonel Boru told us we could make a lot of money," Eli added. 
  Volunteers signed a one-year contract before being 
vaccinated 
against a range of tropical diseases, YEDI'OT AHARONOT said. 
One clause in the contract obliges the mercenaries to keep 
quiet about Levdan's activities. 
  Last week YEDI'OT AHARONOT reported that opponents of 
Lissouba had contacted Israeli officers and businessmen trying 
to recruit 500 soldiers to mount a coup in Brazzaville. The 
opponents described themselves as the "Liberal Party" and 
promised to grant oil and mining concessions to Israel once they 
seized power. 
  Bloody clashes, in which more than 200 were killed, erupted 
between Congo's Government and opposition factions last year 
after October elections in which the president's supporters won 
a majority in parliament. The Congo renewed diplomatic 
relations with Israel in 1991 and the Levdan contract is 
considered by the government in Jerusalem as one of the biggest 
military assistance deals of recent years.

January. This cease-fire is accompanied by a series of concrete 
measures that will contribute to restoring life to normalcy. 
Primary among these measures are: Fighters are to stop any 
further advancements; they are to withdraw with their arms; they 
are to lay down their arms and ammunition; and an intervention 
force is to be established that will be deployed on 14 February. 
In this regard, any armed person caught in the act of 
disrupting peace and order shall be punished in accordance with

  [Text] The cease-fire in the Congo capital, Brazzaville, 
between government forces and opposition militias declared on 13 
January is apparently a very fragile affair. The day that is 
was signed there was a bloody attack on a train and now there 
has been another attack on public transport. From Brazzaville, 
Antoine Muyambala telexed this report. 
  At least three people were killed when a bus was attacked 
yesterday afternoon by people later identified as supporters of 
President Lissouba. Opposition figures dispute the death toll 
saying that at least seven died on the three buses which were 
attacked. However, according to hospital sources, only one 
person, a bus driver, was killed straightaway while two others, 
who had been seriously wounded, later died in hospital. The 
attack happened just outside the opposition stronghold of 
Bacongo. According to the opposition, a number of hostages were 
taken. This appears to have been in revenge for two hostages 
still being held by opposition militants. 
  When I contacted an official from the president's party, he 
confirmed that the attack had been carried out by the 
president's supporters. He also explained that 18 hostages were 
released later in the evening following talks between the two 
sides. This is the second attack on public transport since the 
cease-fire was called on 30 January. The first attack was 
carried out by the opposition the day after an international 
panel of judges decided that the disputed parliamentary 
elections in the Congo would be rerun in only nine 
constituencies. 
  This decision has been a source of great disappointment to 
the opposition since the president's party now has that 
parliamentary majority of 64 seats confirmed, about 10 more 
seats than their opponents. Today, the opposition issued a 
communique to announce that they accepted the outcome of the 
decision.

  [Text] Libreville, 14 Feb (AFP)--Gabon's government has 
postponed local elections for the second time citing low voter 
enthusiasm to register, the continued opposition boycott, and 
organisational problems, government daily the UNION said Monday 
[14 February] citing government sources. The latest 
postponement reschedules the election from March 27 to August 
28. The vote was initially set to go ahead on December 19 last 
year. 
  The postponement could feed political tension which exploded 
last December following the contested election victory of 
President Omar Bongo. A massive security clampdown, state of 
emergency and curfew was the government's response to violence 
which followed Bongo's election victory. Opposition parties, 
grouped in the Convention of Forces for Change (CFC), claimed 
their candidate, Father Paul Mba Abessole, won the December 5 
vote. Opposition parties immediately said they would boycott 
the local elections in the aftermath of the presidential vote. 
Since then the CFC has been silent on its intentions. 
  The post election curfew and state of emergency were lifted 
Saturday. However, they would be reimposed if "agitators tried 
to sow trouble," Gabon's Defence Minister Martin-Fidele Magnaga 
said. Gabon has been trying introduce computerised election 
rolls to avoid the confusion and claims of election rigging that 
surrounded the presidential vote.

  [Text] Libreville, 14 Feb (AFP) -- A new political party, 
Rally of the Gauls, was created here over the weekend by an 
opposition member who believes his countrymen's origins are 
Gallic. Max-Anicet Koumba, who returned to Gabon in January 
after 13 years living in exile in France, said he chose the 
party's name based on the fact that "our history does not begin 
here in Gabon but dates back to our Gallic origin." He said the 
Gabonese should "return to their pre- independence origins," and 
said the new party attested to Gabon's strong ties with France. 
  "We are going on the basis that the name Gabon does not 
reflect the reality in our country since it derives from a wine 
of Portuguese origin, which as proud people we cannot accept," 
Koumba said, adding that he wants to hold a referendum to adopt 
a "more serious name" for Gabon. 
  Koumba, while in exile, became one of the leaders of the 
first opposition party MORENA [National Recovery Movement], 
along with Paul Mba Abessole, a priest. Abessole was the 
opposition's presidential candidate during elections last 
December that were carried by Gabon's long-serving President 
Omar Bongo.

in Rwanda [UNAMIR] has been reinforced by the arrival of new 
blue helmets. A contingent of 225 Ghanaian troops, part of the 
800-strong Ghanaian battalion, landed in Kigali yesterday. Its 
main task is to maintain security in the whole demilitarized 
area. 
  The other groups making up the Ghanaian battalion are 
expected before the end of the month. The commander of the 
Ghanaian contingent, Brigadier General Andoh, who has been in 
Rwanda for the past month, is also the second in command of the 
UNAMIR headquarters. With the arrival of new observers over the 
next few days, the number of UN mission troops will increase to 
2,600 troops and observers.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 10 Feb (AFP) -- The first vice chairman of 
the Social Christian Democratic Party [PDSC], Mr. Andre 
Bo-Boliko, has confirmed that his party was not canvassing for 
the post of prime minister against Etienne Tshisekedi. 
  At a news conference on 10 February Mr. Bo-Boliko stated: 
"The PDSC considers this post currently not vacant, and the 
party is not obsessed by this fact." 
  The opposition press close to Mr. Tshisekedi had accused the 
PDSC and two other opposition parties belonging to the Sacred 
Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] of "conspiring" against 
Mr. Tshisekedi. USOR has so far considered Mr. Tshisekedi the 
legitimate prime minister through his election by the Sovereign 
National Conference.

President F W de Klerk when he emerged from Durban City Hall 
after a three-hour meeting with King Goodwill Zwelithini on 
Monday. The crowd also booed the joint statement tabled during 
the meeting when it was read to them and one man, tears 
streaming down his face, wailed aloud. 
  King Zwelithini, who was met with thunderous applause, 
calmed 
the crowd, telling them their patience would be rewarded. He 
called on his subjects to exercise restraint on their way home. 
The large crowd was expected to return to King's Park Stadium, 
from where they would be bused home. Before leaving, the crowd 
sang a farewell Zulu song to their monarch. 
  Police maintained a strong presence throughout and 
channelled 
people to their destinations. Durban's litter-strewn West 
Street emptied within minutes.

  [Text] Durban Feb 14 SAPA -- State President F W de Klerk 
says he does not regard Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's 
declaration of a sovereign Zulu kingdom as secession, and says 
the Zulu monarch's demands are negotiable. Mr de Klerk said the 
government would officially respond to the Zulu monarch's claims 
on Thursday [17 February]. 
  In a joint statement by Mr de Klerk and the king after three 
hours of talks in Durban on Monday, the state president said 
"the new position" of the king and the kwaZulu government could 
be fully accommodated within the interim constitution, and 
possible amendments to it. He was referring to a strongly 
worded memorandum by King Zwelithini on Monday in which he 
declared Natal/kwaZulu an independent sovereign kingdom. 
  The joint statement after Monday's talks said the king and 
his traditional prime minister, Inkatha Freedom Party leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, disagreed that the interim constitution 
accommodated the Zulu nation. They insisted on a distinct 
dispensation for the Zulu kingdom, the statement said. Mr de 
Klerk undertook to examine the king's demands and respond fully 
on Thursday. 
  Clear differences between the respective delegations over 
the 
Zulu monarch's demands were visible at their post meeting media 
conference in the Durban City Hall. 
  King Zwelithini also dismissed a question that he was 
seceding, saying he was claiming what rightfully belonged to the 
Zulu nation. "I am asking for something that belongs to me and 
my people -- no one else," the king said. 
  Asked whether he should not be discussing the future of the 
Zulu kingdom with the African National Congress, the king said 
tersely: "I am speaking to the head of state". 
  Mr de Klerk said he did not regard the king's claims as 
secession, saying room could be created for "specific needs". 
He added that under a federal system of government the needs of 
South Africa's diverse population could be accommodated. Mr 
Buthelezi said later he disagreed with Mr de Klerk, adding that 
there was nothing "federalistic about this constitution". 
  Expanding on his king's demands, Mr Buthelezi said a Zulu 
nation was an historical reality and "we have an identifiable 
territory with the [word indistinct]". 
  Mr de Klerk maintained that negotiations were the only way 
to 
achieve an acceptable solution, saying there was a commitment 
from both sides "otherwise we wouldn't be here".

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, president of the </F>
IFP, on the SAPA PR wire service on 13 February] 
  [Text] The minister of constitutional development, Mr Roelf 
Meyer, was reported yesterday as having stated that the Freedom 
Alliance [FA] has been shifting the goal posts and ought to 
clarify its ideas by submitting detailed proposals for 
constitutional amendments. 
  If these reported statements are true in their substance 
South Africa is facing a situation that can only be expressed in 
terms of astonishment, outrage and profound indignation. The 
IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], as well as the Freedom Alliance, 
has constantly negotiated within the parameters of written 
documentation tabled with our counterparts. Such documentation 
reflected the mandates received by the respecting governing 
bodies of the IFP and the Freedom Alliance. At no time have the 
negotiators ever advanced any demands which were not contained 
in such documentation. 
  Furthermore, the analysis of our documentation submitted 
with 
the South African Government since July 2, 1993 when the IFP and 
other members of the Freedom Alliance walked out of the World 
Trade Centre, clearly indicates that we constantly reduced our 
proposals. Our final proposals contained in the December 19, 
1993 document known as the yellow paper were substantially 
agreed upon with government and reflected over two months of 
very intensive negotiations. 
  No proposal was advanced over and above what is contained in 
the yellow paper. The contrary is true, for our negotiating 
team on several occasions showed a great deal of flexibility 
departing from the principles and positions contained in the 
yellow paper. This is particularly true with reference to the 
powers of the provinces set out in Section 126, the fiscal 
autonomy of the provinces set out in Sections 155-159, the role 
of the senate, the provisions of rationalisation, the entire 
chapter on deadlock-breaking mechanisms, the issues of 
provincial civil service and police, the functions of local 
government and many other issues covered by the yellow paper. 
  Negotiations broke down on a clear and cynical either/or 
tabled by SACP [South African Communist Party] chairman, Joe 
Slovo. He indicated that either the Freedom Alliance had to 
accept two conditions or further negotiations would be futile. 
The two conditions were that provinces could not have any 
degree of power which the central government could not also 
exercise in its own name, and that no limit could be put on the 
discretion of the constituent assembly to reconsider the powers, 
functions and boundaries of provinces. 
  What I do not understand is how and why our free media of 
communication does not challenge the repeated accusations by 
Minister Meyer that we have been shifting the goal posts. Why 
is there no investigative journalism which can analyse whether 
there is any merit in such an accusation? Why does nobody ask 
themselves how we can be more detailed and specific in our 
constitutional proposals after we went to the extent of drafting 
a complete set of constitutional amendments which were 
introduced in parliament? These are challenges that our media of 
public communication should undertake for the sake of freedom in 
this country.

Johannesburg this week in an attempt to defuse the tension 
between the organization and the homeland. The two leaders 
agreed to set up a joint committee that will, among other 
things, discuss the homeland's stand on a new dispensation in 
South Africa, as well as the normalization of relations. 
Relations between the ANC and Bophuthatswana deteriorated 
further recently following several incidents in which ANC 
political activities in Bophuthatswana were disrupted by the 
security forces.

<F P=106> [Report by P.J. Muller and De Wet Potgieter] </F>
  [Text] South Africa's next minister of defense could be an 
arch-communist. Rumors are rife that Ronnie Kasrils, chief of 
the ANC's [African National Congress] espionage division, is 
currently being regarded by the ANC as the number one contender 
for the defense portfolio when a cabinet of national unity gets 
drawn up after the elections. 
  Kasrils, member of the South African Communist Party's 
Central Committee as well as the ANC's Executive Committee, 
played a significant role in the ANC's terror onslaught against 
the republic. He also orchestrated the ANC's protest against the 
government of the Ciskei, which culminated in a bloodbath at its 
capital, Bisho. 
  RAPPORT has been told that he is currently enjoying more 
support in prominent ANC circles than General Bantu Holomisa of 
the Transkei, who has for a while been a front runner for this 
portfolio. General Holomisa, a confidant of Nelson Mandela, is 
believed to be currently regarded as someone with too much of a 
political "past." APLA's [Azanian People's Liberation Army] 
murder gangs have for the past three years been launching terror 
strikes from the Transkei. His support of APLA has gained 
General Holomisa personal popularity among certain ANC 
supporters, but there is fear that the Defense Force will not 
accept his presence as minister. 
  Kasrils is a member of the Transitional Executive Council's 
subcouncil for defense and is being regarded in ANC ranks as one 
of the experts in the field of defense. It is believed that he 
could make a success of the position and win the support of the 
officers. 
<H5>  Flattery About Him </H5>
  From a survey conducted by RAPPORT in Defense Force circles, 
it would seem that he is acceptable to at least some officers. 
Senior officers spoke flatteringly about him after last week's 
Air Force Day ceremonies. His positive comments about the Air 
Force are believed to have assured him a few more friends among 
Air Force officers. 
  But in the Army, from whose ranks the last four Defense 
Force 
chiefs had been appointed, Kasrils's presence could cause 
tensions. The general staff recently warned President F.W. de 
Klerk and his cabinet that the majority of officers will perhaps 
not support the government in the event of conflict with 
right-wing elements in the country. 
<H5>  Open Rebellion </H5>
  The question is whether the appointment of a communist and 
former "enemy" as minister of defense will not perhaps result in 
an open rebellion within the Defense Force. Especially if a new 
government would decide to disband the local white commandos. 
<H5>  Modise Not Named </H5>
  It is obvious that Mr. Joe Modise, commander of MK [Umkhonto 
we Sizwe, Spear of the Nation -- ANC Military Wing], has not 
been named as a candidate for the defense portflolio. Mr. 
Modise is the most senior "military man" in the ANC, but 
represents the "Transvaal" element within the organization. For 
a long time there has been tension between him and the 
Xhosa-speaking sector inside the ANC. 
  General Gabriel Ramushwana, former military dictator of 
Venda, who was recently appointed as commander of the national 
peace force now being trained near Bloemfontein, is being 
regarded as a logical successor to General Georg Meiring as 
chief of the Defense Force. Until last week, he was still on the 
ANC list of election candidates.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page] </F>
  [Text] ILANGA recently learnt that ANC [African National 
Congress] intelligence supremo Moe Shaik is a man on the move. 
  Some time ago, as part of a campaign against MK [Spear of 
the 
Nation; ANC military wing] murders, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] staged a protest outside Shaik's house. It also 
announced that Mr. Shaik was the Natal director of the ANC's 
sinister Department of Intelligence and Security (DIS). 
  Because of his position the IFP alleged that he must at 
least 
bear knowledge of MK's involvement in the serial murder of IFP 
leaders. 
  The ANC's Southern Natal regional executive committee (REC) 
then issued a statement admitting that Shaik was an ordinary 
member of the ANC but denying he was a member of DIS or involved 
in MK. 
  Shaik then shot to prominence during February 1993 when he 
was included in an ANC team tasked to investigate the Golela 
arms-smuggling incident, implicating several senior members of 
MK and the ANC. The ANC investigation team included MK Chief of 
Staff Siphiwe Nyanda and NEC [National Executive Committee] 
member Mathew Phosa. 
  If the earlier Southern Natal REC statement is to be 
believed 
Shaik's rise through the ranks of the ANC was astounding. 
However the rise of the Secret Shaik does not end there. 
  Moe Shaik has been appointed to the TEC's [Transitional 
Executive Committee] intelligence subcouncil but not as an ANC 
representative. The ANC representative is Alfred Nzo, one of 
Shaik's colleagues in DIS. Mr. Shaik is actually the SACP 
[South African Communist] representative on the subcouncil. 
  ILANGA recently obtained a top secret National Intelligence 
Service (NIS) report which touted members for the proposed 
cabinet of a government of national unity. Imagine our surprise 
when one Riaz Moe Shaik was named as Minister of Intelligence 
Services. 
  ILANGA soon received a further shock when it studied another 
top secret report, this time an ANC document entitled "ANC 
Proposals for a Government of National Unity Cabinet." Shaik 
was again punted for Minister of Intelligence Services. 
  One doubts whether this is simply a coincidence. Instead it 
may be the result of what is known in the SACP as collective 
decisionmaking. What is new is that the South African 
Government has become part of the collective. One thing is 
clear though: a lot of people are clearly rewarding Moe Shaik 
for something.

  [Text] The police have accused the ANC [African National 
Congress] of making a political issue of the raid on the ANC's 
office at Woodstock in Cape Town. 
  A police spokesman, General Leon Mellett, said it was a pity 
that the ANC had tried to politicize an incident in which the 
police were pursuing a criminal suspect. He said the suspect 
was being sought in connection with three murders, eight 
attempted murders, and the possession of explosives and unlawful 
firearms. The raid was carried out in response to information 
that the man had been involved in a shooting with three 
policemen in Khayelitsha. General Mellett said the ANC should 
say why it had hindered the police in their search of the 
building.

  [Text] The police have expressed the hope that its raid on 
the ANC's [African National Congress] Cape Town offices will not 
ruin its relations with the party. A police spokesman, Colonel 
Raymond Dowd, said the police met a delegation under the 
chairmanship of the Western Cape ANC Chairman Dr. Allan Boesak 
this afternoon to discuss the incident. Col. Dowd said that the 
actions of the Internal Stabiity Unit should not be condemned 
before the outcome of the investigation was known. 
  Earlier Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel called in the 
help of the UN Observer Mission in South Africa in an attempt to 
protect the credibility of the police. Mr. Kriel said that he 
had asked the mission to make UN observers available on a 
24-hour basis, to accompany the police on any law enforcement 
duties involving entering the premises of any political party or 
organization. 
  The ANC has termed the raid on its Cape Town offices brutal 
and has called for the resignation of Mr. Kriel. The ANC 
demanded answers as to why the raid had taken place and what 
disciplinary steps would be taken against policemen responsible 
for alleged insults.

  [Text] Pretoria Feb 14 SAPA -- Conservative Party leader 
Ferdi Hartzenberg on Monday [14 February] dismissed the National 
Party's [NP] call on Freedom Alliance supporters to vote for the 
NP in the elections as "laughable in the highest degree". 
  A vote for the NP was in fact a vote for the African 
National 
Congress [ANC], Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement. 
  The NP, in alliance with the African National Congress, had 
through secret deals and memoranda of understanding concocted a 
"draconian" constitution. "They who first let loose the 
communist monster and later notoriously capitulated before it, 
who could not control the ANC while they had all the government 
instruments at their disposal, now ask our people to support 
them as they enter the opposition benches." 
  This reminded one of the tale of the child who had murdered 
its parents and pleaded with the court for extenuating 
circumstances because he was now an orphan, Dr Hartzenberg said.

<F P=106> [From the "PM News Wrap" program, presented by Dennis </F>
O'Donnell -- live] 
  [Text] [O'Donnell] The rebel right-wing parliament decided 
at its first meeting today not to participate in the April 
election. This was announced by the leader of the Conservative 
Party, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg. On the line now we have Amanda 
Visser. Good afternoon to you, Amanda. 
  [Visser] Good afternoon. 
  [O'Donnell] What reasons were given for this decision? 
  [Visser] Well, Dr. Hartzenberg said that they have 
negotiated 
with the ANC [African National Congress] and the government, 
they have given their final demands. Those demands were not 
met, and they still don't have self-determination, and because 
they don't have self-determination they are not prepared to go 
into a government that will be, as they put it, a communist 
parliament and a communist government. 
  [O'Donnell] So what are their plans now, then? 
  [Visser] Well, they said that they are going to put pressure 
on the elections, as they can. What they mean by that is not 
quite clear, but they say that they are going to start at the 
local level. They are not going to participate in the 50-50 
[proposed 50 percent white, 50 percent black local councils]; 
they are going to get their own burger [citizen] councils which 
they are going to get in place, and they are going to put 
whatever kind of pressure they can to stop this election. 
  [O'Donnell] And does this decision from the right-wing 
parliament include the other members of the Freedom Alliance? 
People like the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], Bophuthatswana, and 
so on? 
  [Visser] Well, they were not here today, apparently, but it 
seems as if they will also not participate, because they said 
that if the Swazis can have their own territory, Inkatha must 
have their own territory, the Boer volk [nation] must have their 
own territory, and that is the kind of demands that the IFP 
made, as well. Those demands were not met, so they will not 
particpate.

proposal providing for a right-wing homeland. 
  However, Koos Botha, Independent MP for Wonderboom, said 
that 
Afrikaners must grab this opportunity because they will not get 
a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] any other way. 
  Some time ago, the government and the ANC [African National 
Congress] proposed to the Afrikaner National Front [AVF] that 
self-determination, with the possibility of a homeland, could be 
added as a 34th principle of the new constitution. 
  Botha reckons that this proposal offers the only sensible 
solution. "Afrikaners who are really serious about a volkstaat 
would then be able to indicate in the election exactly how 
strongly they feel about this idea." 
  He said that a volkstaat cannot be attained through a war. 
"How are Afrikaners going to make war in a country where in any 
given region they are in the minority?" 
  The chairman of the Afrikaner Freedom Foundation [AFF], 
Professor Carel Boshoff, said that the AFF believed from the 
start that a volkstaat had to be entrenched in the constitution. 
However, according to Boshoff, Afrikaners' participation in the 
election on the basis of this proposal is linked to further 
negotiations relating the minimum demands of the Freedom 
Alliance [FA]. 
  "If the principle of a volkstaat is acceptable to the 
constitution, then there is no reason why the FA's minimum 
demands can also not be part of it." 
  Boshoff said it would be of no use trying to determine the 
geographic region for a volkstaat through a referendum as the 
vote of the Afrikaner will be in the minority throughout the 
whole country. 
  HNP [Reformed National Party] leader Jaap Marais rejected 
the 
proposal. According to him it is a cunning trick by the 
government and the ANC to get the Afrikaner to go to the ballot 
box. 
  "This is the one thing that we must not do. By doing so we 
will be lending legitimacy to the election and deprive ourselves 
of the moral right to any future civil uprising." He says it is 
ridiculous to expect the Afrikaner to go and live in a volkstaat 
while the whole country belongs to him. 
  Boer State Party leader Robert van Tonder said the Afrikaner 
could not win anything by participating in the election. "We can 
only lose everything. Participation will cause dissension in 
right-wing ranks." 
  Boer Resistance Movement leader Andrew Ford branded the 
proposal a "farce" that was part of the "communist strategy."

<F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>
  [Text] Right-wing plans for a rebels' volkstaat [Afrikaner 
homeland] are far advanced and the first phase for a unilateral 
declaration of independence--like the one in the former 
Rhodesia--could come into operatiion as early as this week. 
  Pressure from militant circles for the process of creating a 
volkstaat starting without delay was intensifying at the time of 
going to press, especially after the Afrikaner National Front 
[AVF] had announced on Thursday [10 February] that it would not 
take part in the April elections. But the decision to declare a 
volkstaat had already been made in Pretoria on 18 January. The 
moderate faction in the AVF under the leadership of General 
Constand Viljoen has, however, apparently been given time to 
exhaust the negotiation option first. 
<H5>  Victory </H5>
  The militant faction in the AVF this week achieved victory 
after victory at consecutive meetings of the CP's [Conservative 
Party] Executive Committee and the "transitional parliament." 
The faction is capitalizing on the 29 January events, when 
General Viljoen was booed in Pretoria while he -- under certain 
conditions -- was calling for participation in the election. 
Well known moderates in the AVF were not even present on 
Thursday when the "transitional parliament" authorized a 
decision to boycott the election. Among them were General 
Constand Viljoen and two CP MP's -- Drs. Corne and Pieter Mulder. 
  The approximately seven to 10 CP MP's who are in favor of 
participation in the election showed no signs of resistance in 
the midst of emotional intimidation from far right wingers. 
<H5>  Elated </H5>
  Spokesmen in the militant faction of the AVF were elated 
yesterday over the victories achieved this week. To further rub 
salt into the wounds, AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader 
Eugene Terreblanche yesterday unequivocally rejected proposals 
to get international mediation on the volkstaat issue. "It is 
just a trick to sow division within the National Front," Mr. 
Terreblanche said. But it is General Viljoen who on several 
occasions has been toying with the idea of calling in 
international mediators. 
<H5>  Fight Back </H5>
  Despite these drawbacks, sources in the moderate group said 
they were going to fight back. They give the assurance that 
differences will be brought to a head within "10 days." 
  Preparations for a rebels' state have nevertheless been 
underway for a long time, with two MP's, Messrs. Schalk Pienaar 
and Kobus Beyers, playing a significant role. 
  It revolves around a so-called "resistance map" in which a 
large portion of the country has been designated as a future 
volkstaat in contrast to the "peace map" for which negotiations 
between the government, the ANC and the AVF over the past few 
weeks yielded nothing. Meanwhile, it has come to light that 
neither the CP nor the AWB support this map and that even the 
AVF's Executive Committee rejected it. 
  The "peace map" makes provision for 15 percent of the 
country's area as a volkstaat. It has been rejected by both the 
government and the ANC. 
  The more than 60 CP-controlled city councils in the 
Transvaal 
and the Orange Free State will play an important role in the 
establishment of a rebels' state. After the CP-orientated 
Transvaal Municipal Association indicated that it would not take 
part in a new constitutional dispensation, it is a foregone 
conclusion that right wingers will find refuge around these city 
councils and even defend them with weapons. 
<H5>  Radio Pretoria </H5>
  The success achieved through Radio Pretoria will serve as a 
model for resistance surrounding the city councils. On Friday 
General Viljoen, in an interview with RAPPORT, broadly referred 
to an "emergency solution" to attain a volkstaat peacefully. 
He was reluctant to elaborate further, except to say the 
transitional constitution has to be amended to legalize the 
implementation of a volkstaat during the interim period of five 
years. 
  Yesterday Gen. Viljoen castigated ANC leader Nelson Mandela 
in an open letter over his umpteenth utterance that a volkstaat 
will not materialize. "Your current statements do not match 
what has been going on during the negotiation process and it has 
left my team confused and embarrassed," the letter stated.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page; article published in </F>
English] 
  [Text] Reports surrounding problems within the so-called 
national Peacekeeping Force (NPKF), training outside 
Bloemfontein, come as no surprise. Trainees reportedly lack 
even basic discipline, and have been repeatedly drunk. They do 
not obey commands of superior officers, which in any real 
military or police force would constitute a serious offence. 
  Instructors have even been assaulted. Hundreds of trainees 
have been observed toyi-toying [protest dancing] around the 
camp, chanting "one settler, one bullet." Intimidation of some 
trainees by others has been such that other trainees, in fear of 
their lives, have been sleeping out in the bush. 
  According to one report in a Sunday newspaper members of the 
supposed peacekeeping force demanded one dead SAP [South African 
Police] member and one dead SADF [South African Defense Force] 
member by sunrise. Large numbers of trainees attached to the 
police forces of the homelands as well as the SAP have simply 
felt in disgust. 
  If reports are true, then those trainees who are seemingly 
incapable of behaving like real soldiers are members of MK 
[Spear of the Nation; African National Congress military wing]. 
The purported reason for the National Peacekeeping Force is 
that the SAP is incapable of impartially policing black 
townships. A new, more credible force is needed, so they say. 
This is not true. But what is quite obvious though is that a 
large number of the NPKF trainees should never be allowed 
anywhere near a uniform or a weapon. 
  If members of MK at the camp are unable to prevent 
themselves 
from intimidating and threatening their fellow trainees, is it 
not likely that they will do much worse to members of the public 
in the townships? That goes without saying. 
  The whole idea that MK can impartially maintain law and 
order 
in the townships, whether part of a national peacekeeping force 
or not, is absurd. This is particularly so given that the NPKF 
is supposedly intended as a kind of "fire brigade" which could 
be deployed quickly to stabilize volatile areas of political 
conflict in which the ANC is usually a role player. 
  In fact the debacle outside Bloemfontein tends to contradict 
claims by the ANC, that MK and its associated "self-defence 
units" are involved in impartial protection of township 
residents. That is, quite frankly, nonsense. 
  What is most disturbing about the behaviour of the 
riff-raff in training for the peacekeeping force is that these 
are supposed to be the best MK could offer. They are supposed 
to be the elite. No wonder the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche laughs when Nelson Mandela 
threatens violence against the rightwing. Terreblanche's 
pot-bellied commandos were previously considered something of a 
military joke. It is now clear however that in a match against 
MK it would be an unfair fight. 
  Let us strip away some myths about the liberation struggle. 
If the propaganda is to be believed then MK was supposed to be 
fighting for freedom against the apartheid regime. But how many 
enemy soldiers did MK kill? Very few. More important for MK 
was murdering black people who happened to belong to 
organisations outside of the ANC camp. 
  This is what MK and the SDU's [Self-Defense Units] continue 
to do. In September last year the Minister of Law and Order 
stated that an incredible 3,258 MK members had been arrested for 
crimes of violence during the last 12 month period for which 
statistics were available. 
  ANC leaders, who incidentally were never soldiers, like to 
now appear before crowds in crisp, brand new camouflage uniforms 
imported from Cuba. MK is presented as a glorious army, and no 
doubt this generates much support in certain quarters. 
  But it is in fact wrong to compare MK to any conventional 
military force. More accurate in fact to compare MK to an 
organisation like the government's sinister CCB, the Civil 
Cooperation Bureau. But, by all accounts, the Government's 
death squads were more disciplined. 
  Like the Government's former death squads, MK's style is 
shooting a man in his home. Or throwing a hand grenade at 
unarmed people waiting at a bus stop. 
  The vast majority of victims could never be described as 
enemy combatants, not in any kind of military conflict. Because 
of this, in spite of being militarily ineffective MK 
nevertheless managed to kill a large number of people. 
  If MK had been a real military force there would be fewer 
objections to its integration into reconstructed security forces. 
  What is clear now, more than ever before, is not only that 
MK 
members lack the discipline a security force requires. They are 
also clearly incapable of peacekeeping without prejudice.

  [Text] The commander of the National Peacekeeping Force, 
Major General Gabriel Ramushwana, says he has resigned from all 
his controversial posts. He said at the General De Wet Training 
Grounds in Bloemfontein that he had not only resigned as chief 
minister of Venda, but also from the Transitional Executive 
Council's subcouncil on defense. He was also no longer an ANC 
[African National Congress] candidate for the coming election. 
On the alleged poor hygiene at the base, Gen. Ramushwana said 
the situation had been caused by Transkei sending too many 
soldiers. Many of them had been sent back.

Tanzania. PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] officials said in 
Johannesburg that the vehicle in which Mr. Phama was traveling 
with a bodyguard had been involved in a collision with a lorry 
while on his way to the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, from 
Tanzania. The bodyguard is in a critical condition in a 
hospital in Tanzania. 
  The officials said Mr. Phama had been on his way to Harare 
apparently to prepare for his return to South Africa where he 
was to assume a major role in the PAC's election campaign. He 
is expected to be buried in Transkei.

<F P=106> [Article by Dominic Jones] </F>
  [Text] Police are cracking down on Israeli airline El Al 
after a man was arrested allegedly smuggling diamonds worth 
R[rand]1.7-million out of South Africa in his underpants. 
  Mr. Meir Shumer, 48, an Israeli citizen, is in police 
custody 
after appearing in the Kempton Park magistrate's court on 
Tuesday. 
  Police say this is the fourth time in 18 months they have 
seized diamonds or gold smuggled on El Al flights from 
Johannesburg to Tel Aviv. 
  Immigration records show that Mr. Shumer's arrest came on 
his 
thirteenth trip to South Africa since 1990. 
  On most of his visits, police said, he stayed for between 
one 
and three days before returning to Israel -- almost always 
choosing to fly El Al. 
  Police say El Al's Saturday-night flight appears to have 
become a hot favourite with professional smugglers and dishonest 
emigrants in spite of El Al's reputation for having the 
strictest security in the world. 
  The possibility that airline staff may be colluding with 
smugglers has not been ruled out. 
  Last year Reserve Bank investigators working on a 
R179-million fraud case were told by an informant in a sworn 
statement that the airline's staff were helping wealthy South 
Africans get their riches out of the country. 
  Within weeks of this, Germiston diamond and gold unit 
detectives arrested El Al security officer Derek Joel Niss, 35, 
for trying to smuggle a suitcase filled with more than 670 
Krugerrands into a plane cargo hold. 
  Niss said after his conviction that he suspected a cartel of 
emigrating South Africans had paid him the R5,000 cash bribe he 
received for each coin-filled suitcase he slipped on the plane. 
  He said he had handled about 20 consignments before his 
arrest. 
  Niss's arrest was the second time police had seized gold 
coins destined for Israel on an El Al flight. Last February 
they found a suitcase containing 1,100 Krugerrands which had 
been checked in for transport to Tel Aviv. The owner has still 
not been traced. 
  And in another diamond-smuggling case, police arrested 
Israeli courier Moshe Landman when he tried to board an El Al 
flight 18 months ago with R55,000 in diamonds hidden in one of 
his boots. Landman had travelled to South Africa 15 times -- 
mostly with El Al -- before being caught. 
  Last Saturday police swooped on passengers travelling 
overseas on various airlines at Jan Smuts. 
  Diamonds and gold unit detectives Colonel Clement Jackson 
and 
Captain Henk van Rensburg picked out Mr. Shumer from the line of 
passengers moving through passport control. 
  Mr. Shumer, who claims to be a diamond consultant, was taken 
to a cubicle and asked to strip down to his underwear, said 
police. He was then arrested. 
  Police said Mr. Shumer arrived in South Africa with his wife 
-- it was her first trip -- two weeks ago and the two apparently 
took time off to holiday in George and Cape Town. 
  Mrs. Shumer, who was also searched, went on to Tel Aviv. Mr. 
Shumer was not asked to plead when he appeared in the Kempton 
Park magistrate's court on Tuesday. A bail hearing has been set 
for February 23. 
  If convicted, Mr. Shumer faces a maximum sentence of 10 
years' imprisonment and R250,000 fine. 
  Police says they are now obliged to carry out more frequent 
and more thorough searches of passengers using El Al. 
  Explaining how smugglers were slipping past his security 
officers, an El Al security spokesman said the airline was 
mainly concerned with apprehending potential hijackers and 
terrorists.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Election Boycott Heightens Risk of Violence -- The Freedom 
Alliance (FA) boycott of the April election "has raised 
political temperatures and heightened the risk of increased 
violence," notes a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in 
English on 15 February. By not contesting the election, "the FA 
has put itself beyond the disciplinary sanction of the 
Independent Electoral Commission, a development which will 
complicate the task of controlling alliance zealots. Within 
hours of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] decision to boycott the 
election, gunmen suspected of having IFP links attacked the 
Zevenfontein squatter camp, north of Johannesburg, killing four 
people and wounding nine more. The victims were reported to be 
ANC [African National Congress] supporters." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Constraints of Single Ballot -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in 
English on 15 February in a page-10 editorial believes the 
National Party (NP) and the ANC "may be inclined to withdraw 
their offer of a double ballot, with separate votes for national 
and regional government, now that the Freedom Alliance parties 
seem likely to boycott the election. But the constraints of a 
single ballot are plain. Only six of the 19 parties (including 
the major contestants) are contesting everything. Their 
supporters's single cross, in any region, will count for that 
party in Parliament and regional legislatures. People voting 
for any of the other 13 parties forfeit some choice." "One vote 
is supposed to count twice; in many cases it may count once, 
forcing voters to choose between a national say and a local one. 
Our new freedom has limits." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  IFP, Freedom Alliance `Spoiling for a Fight' -- Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 15 February in a page-8 editorial "would 
grant members of the IFP and the Freedom Alliance their right to 
boycott the elections -- just as we do Azapo [Azanian People's 
Organization] -- if they stopped their tactics of deliberately 
spoiling for a fight. The fact that the other parties taking 
part in the coming elections are doing everything to get these 
organisations into the elections exposes their refusal to go to 
the polls."

  [Text] [Words indistinct] because UN Special Representative 
Alioune Blondin Beye has again moved for an information 
blackout. This morning everyone was ready for the resumption of 
the peace talks, which should now discuss the role of the UN 
Angola Verification Mission-3, including a UN contingent of blue 
beret forces. 
  The UN special representative's team was the last to arrive, 
but it is already in Lusaka, and yesterday it met the leaders of 
the government and National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] teams. 
  All this happens at a time when UNITA President Dr. Jonas 
Malheiro Savimbi, who is also Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola [FALA] supreme commander, has expressed optimism and said 
he is ready for a political solution to the Angolan conflict. 
He expressed those views in interviews he granted to a 
Portuguese television station and to Portugal's O PUBLICO 
newspaper. UNITA said it favors a general cease-fire and asked 
Luanda to also make political concessions. 
  In those interviews Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi rejected any 
possibility that there could be a military resolution to the 
Angolan conflict.

  [Text] The government and the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] may be involved in peace talks in 
Lusaka, but the war is taking on new dimensions in the country. 
UNITA is carrying out offensive operations in all parts of the 
country. In Malange, the situation has been described as 
worrisome. The city's outlying areas have come under attack and 
mines have been planted in the paths leading to the farming 
areas. General (Agostinho Nelumba Sanjar), commander of the

  [Text] An African National Congress [ANC] delegation 
arrived in Luanda today on an official visit at the invitation 
of the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]. 
The delegation is headed by Tokyo Sexwale, a member of the ANC 
Executive Committee. Sexwale was welcomed by MPLA Secretary 
General Lopo do Nascimento. Speaking to journalists, Sexwale 
said he was particularly optimistic about the future of the 
South African people. 
  [Begin Sexwale recording, in English fading into Portuguese 
translation] We believe a democratic South Africa will play an 
important role in the region and will go a long way in helping 
the people of Angola themselves to solve their problems. [end 
recording] 
  This afternoon, the ANC delegation called at the MPLA 
headquarters to learn about the activities carried out by the 
party that won the first multiparty elections in Angola. Lopo 
do Nascimento discussed the activities of his party, leading to 
the September 1992 victory at the polls. He blamed the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola for the deplorable 
state of the country. 
  One of the main goals of the ANC delegation's visit to 
Angola 
is to learn about the Angolan elections because the first 
multiracial elections will be held in South Africa soon. Also 
today, the ANC delegation went to the Congressional Palace, 
where MPLA members of parliament told them about electoral 
systems. Tomorrow, the ANC delegation is scheduled to visit 
Benguela Province.

  [Text] Large crowds welcomed the presidents of Botswana and 
Zimbabwe when they arrived in the Lesotho capital Maseru today 
to assess the causes of the strike between the two army 
factions. The Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who arrived 
just before noon, was met by Lesotho prime minister, Dr. Ntsu 
Mokhehle, cabinet ministers, diplomats, and senior government 
officials. Botswana President Ketumile Masire arrived about 40 
minutes after Mr. Mugabe. The visits of the two leaders follows 
an appeal from the Lesotho Government to presidents of Botswana, 
Zimbabwe, and South Africa. All three met during the talks in 
Botswana about two weeks ago.

  [Text] The right honorable the prime minister, Dr. Ntsu 
Mokhehle, says the presence of their excellencies the presidents 
of Zimbabwe and Botswana in Lesotho is a testimony to the deep 
commitment that they pledge to the process of building a truly 
democratic and conflict free community of nations in the region. 
  The prime minister said this yesterday in his welcome speech 
on the occasion of the visit of President Robert Mugabe of 
Zimbabwe and President Quett Masire of Botswana. Dr. Ntsu 
Mokhehle said their mission in Lesotho is a peacemaking one 
necessitated by an important recognition that African countries 
can no longer afford conflicts that have wrecked the continent. 
  He noted with appreciation the rapid progress being made 
toward a non-racial democracy in South Africa, and the 
unwavering support of the Frontline States to the liberation 
struggle in that country. He said conflicts are the scourge 
that has bedeviled Africa for ages, adding that they are to 
blame for economic difficulties and poverty in which most 
African peoples find themselves. Meanwhile, the two presidents 
will be taken on a conducted tour to the Lesotho Highlands 
Development Project at Katse today.

  [Text] King Letsie III of Lesotho has expressed the hope 
that the country's forces, which recently disengaged from 
combat, will return to the barracks and stay there for good. He 
said factional fighting within the Royal Lesotho Defense Force 
had put the country's fledgling democracy to a severe test. 
  King Letsie was speaking at a banquet in Maseru last night 
which he held for the Botswana president, Sir Ketumile Masire, 
and the Zimbabwean president, Mr. Robert Mugabe, who went to 
Lesotho to discuss the recent fracas in that country. He noted 
that the soldiers returned to the barracks after mediation by 
church leaders and international and regional organizations, 
including SADC [Southern African Development Community] and 
Frontline States leaders. 
  King Letsie said Basotho were encouraged to realize that the 
SADC-Frontline States region was now adopting a more proactive 
role in matters concerning regional stability and peace. He 
called on Basotho and the government to use the opportunity 
provided by the return to peace to pursue, deepen, and broaden 
national reconciliation to include all areas of national 
endeavor to encompass all sectors of Lesotho without any 
exception. 
  President Masire and Mr. Mugabe held meetings with Lesotho's 
parliamentarians and former King Moshoeshoe II this morning. 
They later met opposition leaders and were expected to meet 
army commanders. Sir Ketumile is expected to address a press 
conference at the airport before leaving for Gaborone this 
afternoon at 1530.

  [Text] Lusaka, 10 Feb (ZANA/PANA) -- Malawian opposition 
leader, Chakufwa Chihana, has refuted reports that he would seek 
an immediate re-definition of Malawi's border with Zambia to 
retrieve some lost tracts of land, if voted into power in the 
coming presidential election in his country. 
  Chihana, who is on a two-day private visit to Zambia, told 
reporters in Lusaka on Wednesday [9 February] that at no time 
did he say he would seek the re-definition of the border between 
Zambia and Malawi. "It should now go on record that I have 
never and will never make such demands unless I am mad", he said. 
  He attributed what he called, the misleading reports to the 
Malawian Government and fellow opponents who, he said, had 
teamed up to malign him before the Zambian Government. 
  "Zambians are our brothers and sisters and I should assure 
you that my intentions are that when the need arises, Malawians 
and Zambians should meet to consider breaking the border so that 
the two peoples could mix freely. We are one and the same 
people,"Chihana said.

  [Text] Brazilian General Lelio Goncalves da Silva, 
commander of the UN peacekeeping force in Mozambique, has 
described as absurd, unfounded, and unjust the remarks made by 
Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo]. Ngonhamo has said that the United Nations 
will be to blame, if war resumes in this country. 
  Gen. Lelio da Silva told NOTICIAS that the United Nations 
was 
invited by the government and Renamo to supervise the 
implementation of the Mozambican peace process, so Gen. 
Ngonhamo's remarks make no sense whatever. On 7 February, Gen. 
Ngonhamo said that a resumption of the war would have to be 
blamed on the United Nations, and in particular on UN Special 
Representative Aldo Ajello, who has not known how to be 
impartial when he has mediated in a bid to settle certain 
differences.

<F P=106> [Report by Boaventura Macaulze in Nampula] </F>
  [Excerpts] Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], has reiterated his 
accusations against Eduardo da Silva Nihia, Mozambique 
Liberation Front [Frelimo] first secretary for Nampula Province. 
Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo had said Nihia is training 1,000 men to fight 
Renamo if it wins the upcoming October elections. Ngonhamo said 
those men were being trained in area [poligono] number two, in 
Nampula District. 
  Addressing Mozambican reporters at Nampula airport this 
morning, Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo added that Nihia had tried to train a 
riot police force on the outskirts of the city of Nampula with 
the aim of intimidating people during the elections. [passage 
omitted] 
  The reporters asked Ngonhamo to discuss in depth Nihia's 
alleged involvement in the training of men to destabilize the 
Mozambican peace process. 
  [Begin Ngonhamo recording] [words indistinct] the 1,000 men 
who were in area number two. Mr. Nihia was controlling that 
group. On 2 February, Mr. Nihia met with those men in area 
number two. It was not the provincial commander who met those 
men. It was not Mozambique Armed Forces Chief of General Staff 
Hama Thai or General Tobias Dai who came from Maputo to see 
those men. It was not some other commander, like Defense 
Minister Mr. Chipande, for instance. Instead, it was Mr. Nihia. 
Why was that? [words indistinct] can it be that Mr. Nihia was 
involved in a political ploy when he met those 1,000 men in area 
number two? Did he go there to convince them to join Frelimo 
and vote for it at the upcoming elections? (?This is the) truth. 
What was being dealt with at that camp was plans to destroy the 
peace process. Mr. Nihia told those soldiers that they would 
not have to go into assembly areas, they would stay put in that 
area, Frelimo would pay them well and they would get good 
accommodation and food until the elections had been held. If 
Renamo should win, those men would take up positions and attack 
the Renamo government. That is precisely what happened to that 
group of 350 men. There was no police commander controlling 
that group. Such a police commander may have been there as a 
subordinate to Mr. Nihia, who was responsible for the training 
of those men. [end recording] 
  It has not been possible to get Nihia's response to Lt. Gen. 
Ngonhamo's latest accusation, because (?Nihia is still) in 
Maputo. Ngonhamo said that this morning he went to (Mupila) 
assembly area, in Zambezia Province, where he found that his men 
were very keen to join the future national army. He also noted 
that his men were facing salt shortages. This afternoon Lt. 
Gen. Ngonhamo went to Nacala to inspect the training ground for 
the special forces. Noting that 62 Renamo men are already in the 
city to take part in that training, Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo added that 
the other men will be there by tomorrow. Renamo and the 
government are each supposed to provide 300 men to the Special 
Forces Battalion.

  [Text] In a statement issued today, the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] has agreed to withdraw from Salamanga, 
Maputo Province, thus satisfying a demand from the Mozambican 
Government which claims it as an area under its control. For 
many months the government and Renamo have been arguing over 
allegations that Salamanga was occupied by Afonso Dhlakama's 
movement after the General Peace Accord was signed. 
  With this decision, Renamo will not only be carrying out the 
Supervision and Control Commission's [CSC] orders, but will also 
be withdrawing men and war materiel 10 or 30 km away from 
Salamanga. 
  Renamo said in its statement that it made this decision to 
avoid confrontations and to guarantee that peace was maintained 
and that war was not resumed. It said, however, that Salamanga 
must be viewed as a no-man's-land and has called on the 
government to observe such a status.

  [Excerpt] The first 5,000 government and Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] troops joining the future 
Mozambican army, particularly its infantry division, begin their 
training in Dondo, Sofala Province, and in Manhica and Boane, 
Maputo Province, on 21 February. The government has already 
submitted the list of its 2,500 men to the British training 
team. Renamo still has to submit the list of its 2,500 men, but 
the organization says it will do so by 11 February. 
  This morning's session of the Joint Commission for the 
Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces discussed 
issues relating to the creation of the new Mozambican army -- 
namely, the type of organization, budget and logistics, and 
compliance with the dates set for the training of troops. The 
training of the 5,000 infantry soldiers will be given by 
instructors trained in Nyanga, Zimbabwe. British specialists 
will play an advisory role. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The demobilization of troops from the government and 
the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] currently found in 
assembly areas will begin on 1 March. This decision was made 
today during a meeting of the Supervision and Control Commission 
[CSC] of the General Peace Accord. A total of 5 percent of 
troops from both sides will be demobilized in a first phase. 
  Until 1 March Finance Minister Eneas Comiche will create 
conditions to immediately pay the subsidies to the demobilized 
troops and to speed up solving the problems connected with their 
integration into civilian life. 
  Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN secretary 
general in Mozambique, said although there is a considerable 
delay in the process, the demobilization process could continue 
until June. 
  During today's CSC meeting the government, Renamo and the UN 
Operations in Mozambique signed an agreement on criteria on the 
selection and training regulations of the special forces of the 
army.

  [Text] An opinion poll carried out by Gestinform reveals 
that if the multiparty elections were held in January this year, 
there would be no absolute majorities both in presidential and 
legislative elections. In the opinion poll, in which 4,000 
people were interviewed throughout the country, Joaquim 
Chissano, Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] presidential 
candidate, has 45.4 percent of the votes, followed by Mozambique 
National Resistance's [Renamo] Afonso Dhlakama with 32.4 
percent. Dr. Domingos Arouca, leader of the Mozambique United 
Front has 3.3 percent of the votes, followed by Mozambican 
Nationalist Movement's [Monamo] Maximo Dias with 2.4 percent. 
  President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano obtained the most 
votes in Gaza Province, his original home area, where he 
received 60 percent of the votes, and Inhambane where he 
received 61 percent. 
  The Renamo presidential candidate obtained the best results 
-- 49.3 percent -- in Sofala Province where Renamo's general 
headquarters is found. 
  Regarding legislative elections, Frelimo obtained 38.1 
percent of the votes and Renamo 34.2 percent. Monamo received 
4.1 percent, Fumo 3.6 percent, the National Convention Party 2.8

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], has once again said that the Mozambique 
Liberation Front [Frelimo] is not interested in holding the 
elections in October because this party needs more time to 
change its Marxist image. Dhlakama stressed that Frelimo is 
delaying the confinement of its soldiers because it is not 
interested in the holding of elections in October. He added 
that it is extremely dangerous to postpone elections, noting 
that the international community has already warned that the UN 
Operations in Mozambique cannot be maintained indefinitely.

  [Excerpts] "What concrete program should be followed in the 
fields of health, education, culture, and sport? (Please give 
as much detail as you can on provinces and districts, which 
should be given greater attention). What is your party's land 
policy? (Give details)" -- This is the second part of the list 
of questions we sent to registered political parties, with the 
exception of the ruling party, the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo]. These questions fell under social programs and were 
aimed at obtaining the views of the different political parties 
on their strategies for social development. This is also the 
second part of a theme which we began to publish last week on 
these same pages. We hope to publish the third and last part in 
our next edition. 
  For the Mozambican Nationalist Movement [Monamo/PMSD], the 
policy for social progress should be: 
  a) Health, the foundation for health lies in preventing 
different kinds of diseases, physical education, sports, and 
prevention through vaccination. [passage omitted] 
  b) The Land Policy favored by Monamo/PMSD is to guarantee 
that each rural family has sufficient land for agricultural and 
livestock activities. 
  The right to useful land should be realized through free and 
protected settlement, with minimum infrastructures, like water, 
health facilities, trade, schools, and recreational centers. 
  The right of inheritance is significant in order to value 
and 
make good use of the land. 
<H5>  The Mozambican National Union [Unamo] </H5>
  a) Health: reconstruction and extension of the health 
network. The establishment of a system of incentives for medical 
personnel, with a view to increasing the quality of public 
medical service, particularly with admitted patients. [passage 
omitted] 
  b) The land belongs to the state. The state identifies those 
people who have the right to a piece of land, without harming 
future generations. 
  The sale of land to foreigners should be prohibited. They 
should only obtain it through temporary contracts, without 
harming the Nation. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Mozambique Democratic Party [Pademo] </H5>
  Our country has many tribes and each tribe has its own 
assessment of the meaning of land. Thus, as far as Pademo is 
concerned, a land policy should be drawn up by the elected 
assembly in conjunction with a traditional council. The view of 
our party is that people should begin to have title deeds. 
Regarding foreigners, we are of the view that there should be a 
limit to the amount of land they can obtain, depending on their 
objectives. 
  In all modern societies, the defense and promotion of health 
constitute a determining factor in social welfare and increasing 
the capacity to carry out all kinds of tasks. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Joaquim Alberto Chissano by </F>
correspondent Salomao Moyana; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Moyana] How do you see the implementation of the 
General Peace Accord so far? 
  [Chissano] I think it has been positive because we have not 
had war since October 1992. We have taken slow but steady 
steps, and I think that people are getting more confident and 
more certain that war will not come back. 
  I even believe that there is more trust on the Mozambique 
National Resistance's [Renamo] side now. At least they know 
that, whatever the outcome of the elections, they can, if they 
wish, continue their political work without harassment. They 
have been talking about the difficulties of their work, and the 
tendency is to lay the blame for those difficulties at someone 
else's door, as if the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] did 
not have its own difficulties. Yet, little by little, they are 
realizing that those difficulties are inherent to party work and 
that, if they have the courage to continue, they will certainly 
be able to do their work, irrespective of the results of the 
upcoming elections. This gives them a little bit more courage 
and that, in itself, is the result of the correct implementation 
of the General Peace Accord. 
  By this, I do not mean to say that there have been no lows 
along the way. There were some lows that were discouraging at 
times, but they were overcome thanks to perseverance, patience, 
and understanding. I would have liked to say that this was a 
mutual thing, but the truth is that much more has been demanded 
from the government than from Renamo, even though we know that 
there have been serious violations of the accord that cannot be 
regarded as fleeting, sporadic, or isolated violations. They 
have been violations of principle, and those violations have 
come from Renamo. There is no doubt about that. 
  Well, despite all that, I can say that the implementation of 
the General Peace Accord has been positive. I think we may 
enjoy better days when the process of demobilization and 
reintegration of the demobilized soldiers gets off the ground. 
That is a process that will also know difficulties, more often 
than not because demobilized soldiers will not always be aware 
of the state's duties toward them. 
  [Moyana] Mr. President, do you believe that elections will 
be 
held in October of this year? 
  [Chissano] Yes, I do believe that. You will remember that 
elections were to be held one year after the signing of the 
General Peace Accord. It was believed that one year would have 
been sufficient for elections to be held and, as a matter of 
fact, it should have been sufficient. There were delays, 
however, and we know the reasons for those delays. 
  These problems have been overcome, and so we now have 
exactly 
the same time we would have had if everything had gone according 
to plan. We are now in January, and we are already preparing to 
begin training the principal section of the Armed Forces. Many 
soldiers have already been confined. The Electoral Law has been 
approved, and bids are under way concerning material 
preparations for elections. 
  With the Electoral Law issue settled, provinces must already 
be thinking about who their deputies will be, in other words, 
they must be thinking about their candidates. Each party must 
already be preparing for elections. I even think that, in one 
form or another, people are already being educated with a view 
to participating in the upcoming elections. 
  [Moyana] Mr. President, concerning the delays in the 
implementation of the General Peace Accord, what part of the 
blame would you lay at the door of your government? 
  [Chissano] Let me see...there may be some small 
things...they 
are so insignificant, really.... 
  [Moyana] Concerning the issue of housing for Renamo, does 
the 
Mozambican Government not recognize that it could have done more 
to expedite the process? 
  [Chissano] I would say no. The issue of housing is not the 
government's responsibility. If Renamo had really wanted to 
cooperate, it would not even have needed to ask for housing. 
There are so many parties whose leaders have come from abroad 
but who have not asked for housing. There is the case of the 
Mozambique United Front, Fumo, for instance. As an individual, 
rather than as a politician, Fumo President Domingos Arouca was 
the first to discuss the issue of housing with me. The problem 
of housing for Mr. Arouca was only recently settled, but his 
party is functioning. Look at the example of Mr. Jeque, who 
also comes from Portugal and belongs to Fumo. He looked for a 
house and a job. He is employed because he had the will to do 
it. I can cite other examples: Mr. Massinga Chicuarra [not 
further identified], who had been abroad but who has come back 
and found himself a place to stay. There is Mr. Padimbe, who 
belongs to another party, and there is [Mozambican Nationalist 
Movement President] Maximo Dias. 
  Thus, if Renamo had wanted to cooperate, it could have begun 
its work without having to depend on such housing. Well, the 
government has complied with the terms of the General Peace 
Accord because this is not a matter of giving houses away. The 
government does not carry houses in its pockets like so many 
nickels and dimes. The government had to look for these houses. 
It did so, and it found them. In some instances, it was even 
necessary to remove the tenants, but Renamo only realized at a 
later stage that it hd to participate in the search for the 
houses it would be using. It was a matter of understanding 
things. This understanding was a bit slow in coming, but it 
finally came. 
  Perhaps there are, but, off the cuff, I fail to see the 
reason for the government to be blamed for any major delays... 
  [Moyana] What about the issue of logistical conditions for 
Renamo advisers to the provincial governors? Did the government 
act within a reasonable time? 
  [Chissano] Regarding the matter of Renamo's advisers, the 
delay was, once again, due to Renamo itself. You will recall 
that it was in August that Renamo made that request. We 
approved it, but I only received the list before I left on 
leave. Those officials were not appointed, not because I was on 
leave, but because the territorial administration minister was 
not in, either. That happened in December, when everyone was on 
leave, but it is my belief that, even if I had continued on 
leave, the appointments would have been made as soon as the 
territorial administration minister returned. 
  As for material conditions, once we had the men we would see 
why there were conditions that depended on the international 
community's good will. When that matter came up for discussion, 
the problem of increased expenses and what they would represent 
to the state was one of our first concerns. 
  We also discussed the matter of the premises needed. Now, to 
encourage us to make a decision, the international community 
expressed its readiness to help us. Unfortunately, that help 
did not come with the speed the promises were made. It was a 
matter of putting up prefabricated homes in all provinces. 
There were even promises that more houses than we had asked for 
would be put up so as to meet the needs of state workers but, 
yet again, the international community failed to deliver as 
rapidly as possible. I remember that that promise was made at a 
meeting attended by all ambassadors plus the United Nations. 
That promise was made when I handed in a report on the talks 
with Mr. Dhlakama and on the material difficulties I foresaw. 
The answer: "Do not worry!" Well, I did not stop worrying 
because I think that advisers can be received in the required 
conditions in some provinces, but not in others, meaning that 
other problems would be left unresolved. Renamo itself will need 
other premises for its political work. 
  Once again, though, delays here cannot be blamed on a lack 
of 
material conditions. They should be blamed, first and foremost, 
on the absence of candidates to fill in those posts since 
August, resulting in a delay of five months. 
  [Moyana] Does the lack of regular reshuffles mean that you, 
Mr. President, are satisfied with your ministers' performance? 
  [Chissano] It is my opinion that a government reshuffle 
should not occur only when the head of state is unhappy. It is, 
in fact, health to reshuffle the cabinet when everybody is still 
on good terms. Now, if you talk about reshuffles, there are 
people who are outside and who have the desire, or perhaps 
because they believe that a certain official is not acting as 
wished, and they think a reshuffle would help. [sentence as 
published] Perhaps because of the trust they place in me, they 
say: "Look, the president is watching and he will change 
things. He will replace this person with another." However, 
there is one standard that many people do not follow, either, 
and that is to give time to people because people who make 
mistakes, who have some shortcomings, often feel it themselves 
and they know they must find ways to overcome those problems. 
So, there is the need to give people time. I might reshuffle 
the government today. I might remove this person and bring in 
another, but I have no idea what the new person will do. There 
is often the need to give time, help, educate, instruct, and so 
forth. There will be a time when people will say: "Now, this 
fellow is no good for this task." There are times, however, 
when a person is moved because he has shown aptitude and we need 
that person for other duties where we think he might do better, 
or where we might need reinforcements. Then, we shift that 
person. 
  Well, all those assessments have been made. First, prior to 
the signing of the General Peace Accord, there was the need to 
strengthen some sectors, to change routine. In some cases, it 
was not because officials performed poorly. Those measures were 
needed at the provincial and central levels, but we decided 
that, as we were going through a process of change, it would 
have been good for change to occur with the same people at the 
helm and then, after that change, we would see how to go about a 
reshuffle. Personally, that is what I thought. Well, the peace 
accord was delayed and so our decision was delayed. 
  Now we are preparing for elections, people are doing their 
work, and once again there are rumors going around -- they are 
rumors because I have never given a thought to what people say 
outside, they think it and they believe it is reality -- believe 
me, I have been in some very delicate situations. The rumors 
were so many that they even affected people who were directly 
involved and who began to think that the president was 
considering shifting them about without any explanation. It is 
not obligatory for me to provide explanations, but, with the 
trust that exists among us, there is a bad atmosphere when 
people start to talk and the interested party knows nothing 
about it. That is because there was nothing like that from my 
side. I think that those rumors about a government reshuffle 
reflect the interests of an individual or of a group of persons. 
  I must tell you that the members of government have greatly 
improved the quality of their work over the last two years or 
so. There is the need to understand that they, too, are human 
beings, that they have their weak moments, that they can be 
uncertain about the future, and so on. There is good morale 
today, however, much better than anyone might expect, this 
despite the difficult work they have to do in precarious 
financial and economic conditions in all sectors. Thus, I am 
satisfied with the members of my staff, but that does not mean 
that there will not be a reshuffle for the reasons that I have 
indicated earlier. I am going to see when a reshuffle is right, 
so that I can count on the input of all involved in the various 
sectors. 
  [Moyana] It has been widely said in national political 
circles that citizen Joaquim Chissano should publicly make it 
clear when he is visiting a province as head of state and when 
he is visiting it as Frelimo Party chairman. It is also said 
that you use the same General State Budget in both capacities. 
Would you like to comment, Mr. President? 
  [Chissano] I can tell you the following: I have trouble 
traveling as pure and simple citizen Joaquim Chissano. That is 
another distinction they are not mentioning. I would like to go 
wherever I might want to go. For instance, I might want to go 
to that island alone with my wife, but no one will allow me to 
do that. There is always the idea that it is the president of 
the Republic who is traveling, even though I would have liked to 
go there to swim and eat fish like any other citizen -- like 
you, for instance. 
  The fact of the matter is that if I went to some province to 
do my party work, even if I paid for my own ticket -- and I 
would have liked to pay for my ticket to take an aircraft, a 
small aircraft -- people would say: "No, not on such a small 
aircraft." Were I to travel by car, they would say: "That is 
fine, the car can go, but there must be an escort, the protocol 
officials must also go, and so on." I would like to ask: What 
would change? 
  The fact is that, up to now, I have traveled as head of 
state 
and I take advantage of those trips to do party work because I 
have no way to travel as Frelimo Party chairman without that 
being linked to the fact that I am head of state. It would be 
very convenient for me to separate those functions, but I cannot 
be dissociated from my position as head of state. It is 
impossible. Nor can I allow my party to be at a disadvantage 
just because its chairman is also the head of state. 
Nevertheless, that is bound to happen, whether you be head of 
state or some other official. For instance, if a minister who 
is also a Frelimo Party Central Committee member goes to some 
province and is asked questions by party members, he cannot just 
turn around and say: "No, I cannot talk because I am here on 
state duties." That is impossible, too. It would mean that 
parties fighting for power stop being parties when they get to 
power. These are party cadres we are talking about, and any 
party coming to power will have its cadres. Now, what is 
really necessary is to know how to use state property without 
impairing state functions. One does not spend more money just 
by talking of party matters when on a state visit. One spends 
exactly the same.... 
  [Moyana] The fact is, should that be true, Frelimo will 
enjoy 
great political advantage over the other parties, because a 
large number of its members are involved in state duties and are 
using state funds to do their party work. There is also the 
example of the Frelimo Party secretary general, who is a 
minister, traveling to the provinces in his capacity as 
minister, thereby using state funds, but going there to tackle 
party issues.... 
  [Chissano] But that will also be the case with any other 
party. If you have to travel just to do party work as secretary 
general, obviously the party will pay the expenses, but let me 
tell you something: Even then, that official will also be doing 
state work. He cannot stop doing state work simply because the 
party has paid his expenses. The truth is, though, that when 
the emphasis is placed on party work, we make every effort to 
ensure that party funds are made available for that work and not 
the contrary. 
  [Moyana] Do you think that the party that wins the upcoming 
elections should take all or that there should be a preelectoral 
multiparty accord concerning a government of national unity? 
  [Chissano] With regard to that issue, it seems to me that we 
are beginning to see -- not all over the world but with some 
international observers -- a distortion of democracy because of 
events in Angola. It is even beginning to seem as though 
democracy is of no use to Africa. That is absurd. Some seem to 
be sorry that they supported an accelerated implementation of 
multiparty democracy, so they start talking about the need to 
put the cart before the horse. All over the world, there is 
much talk of national unity and of national interests. I also 
endorse national unity views because that is the Frelimo Party's 
philosophy, and I grew up with it, working for national unity, 
so there is no need for anybody to tell me about the need for 
it. Purely and simply, national unity must be based on real 
foundations. We have created a multiparty system to allow the 
people to be consulted in different ways. There is the need to 
see what the people's response will be and, on the basis of that 
response, to look for the best ways to guarantee national unity. 
The people will dictate those ways. Perhaps they will be 
dictated even during the electoral campaign. We will have to see 
the amount of support the existing parties receive, and we will 
to see whether Frelimo needs to consider it. The electoral 
campaign and the outcome of elections will provide indications. 
The party that has those responsibilities will have enough data 
to be able to say what will be needed to guarantee political 
stability in the country, what ought to be done to ensure 
greater national unity, and what should be done to guarantee 
greater participation by the people in all political, economic, 
and social matters. 
  Sometimes there is the tendency to ignore all that and think 
that, just because election results were not accepted in Angola, 
things must be done artificially. Where does that leave 
democracy, though? What is democracy good for, then? What is 
the point of consulting with the people? In other words, we 
would be consulting with the people and saying: "Elect me but do 
not worry; this is just for the sake of electing, because we are 
all going to govern, so there is no problem!" You would have me 
saying in my campaign: "Give some votes to this party and some 
to that other one." That is not my duty. It is each party's 
duty to get votes, because we want to know exactly what people 
think. So, each party should put forward its program with 
sincerity, without thinking whether it will be in power or not. 
The people will choose some program and then whoever wins can 
say: "The people have chosen me, but they have these national 
unity leanings." There might even be the need to reconcile 
parts of programs and correct parts of your program. This is 
how I see democracy. You cannot go around misleading people, 
saying "you choose, but we decide who governs." That cannot be 
done.... 
  [Moyana] There are those who insist on a formal signing of 
a multiparty preelectoral compromise on this issue. 
  [Chissano] What does this mean in terms of democracy? Where 
has it ever happened in that way? That has never happened 
anywhere. The United States, England, and Portugal do not do so. 
  If the Peace Accord negotiations had taken a different turn, 
we would have acted in another way. You will recall that in 
1987-88, I was already saying that if Renamo wanted to lay down 
their weapons and return, we would all together study how to 
reorganize our society. We would adopt new forms of elections. 
I even went as far as researching who was who in Renamo, what 
rank they held, and what they could do and could not do. In 
fact I did not know any of them. I did this because I was very 
worried about the transitional phase that would permit all of us 
to study what changes could be made. We did not get any reply 
until the adoption of a new constitution in 1990 creating 
multipartyism. During negotiations Renamo accepted the 
democratic challenge. So we are now facing a democratic 
challenge, and after all this we are not going to act as if 
nothing has happened. 
  [Moyana] It has been reported by government officials that 
there are conflicts about positions and prospects between the 
IMF, the World Bank, and the Mozambican Government. Someone in 
your government has even said that due to IMF and World Bank 
impositions, the Mozambican Government's sovereignty is no more 
than five percent. Is there any truth in that? 
  [Chissano] No, that is not true. In reality our country has 
been able to maintain a good relationship with the IMF. We 
believe we still exercise most of our sovereignty, and we comply 
with the demands posed by international cooperation, like every 
country does. This is to ensure coordination in the management 
of funds used in monetary and financial activities, as well as 
foreign currency, productive activities all over the world, and 
transactions in general. So, there is always a part of 
sovereignty that one has to give away. I can even say that at 
present blocs are being formed and being strengthened. So, 
everything we do goes through negotiations. We have spent many 
hours and nights negotiating. If we did not respect our 
sovereignty, we would not take a long time negotiating. There 
have been a number of demands made by the World Bank and IMF 
that we have satisfied at once. They may seem to be correct 
solutions, but we, as a responsible government, have to study 
the consequences they will have for the country. Then we have 
to take daring steps wherever we feel we can withstand the 
impact for some time, because it is a reality that reforms are 
necessary. The economic recovery program is a necessary program. 
  The IMF has its rules. The government must decide whether to 
follow them. We are always sovereign; we can choose. If we 
believed there was a better way, we would take it. We will not 
be prevented from doing so. In some cases we do so, as for 
instance in the devaluation of the currency. We have not 
devalued our currency as requested by the World Bank and the 
IMF. We were supposed to do so with greater speed, but that 
would have been more painful for our population. We have to 
administer the medicine in doses, but the impact of the 
resistance may lead to the deterioration of the economy, as in 
the case of civil servants' salaries and budget deficit; we have 
been allowing a comfortable deficit but have to tighten it 
little by little. Whenever an economic measure is announced 
everyone cries, but this is not an imposition by the IMF or the 
World Bank, but by economic laws. 
  [Moyana] People in this country talk a great deal about the 
domination of the south over central and northern Mozambique. 
People speak of continued centralization in Maputo of all 
mechanisms of economic, political, and cultural decisions. As a 
solution, people have a number of hypotheses: federalism and 
elected -- rather than appointed -- governors, administrators, 
and mayors. I would like to know what do you think about that. 
  [Chissano] I believe we should continue studying this issue. 
As you know, the Constitution left this issue open so that a 
study can be carried out. The study is already underway and is 
being supervised and financed by international bodies. A 
responsible study is underway because a solution cannot be found 
with closed eyes. A profound analysis is needed. You spoke, 
for instance, about governors. Who can tell whether a governor, 
and not any other figure, should be elected? I know countries 
where a region has an elected body, and a representative of the 
central government with specific powers; who would this 
representative be? A governor or administrator? Up to which 
level shall we have these figures? One should study all this. 
One should study the relationship between elected and 
traditional power. All this is being dealt with in the study we 
are carrying out. 
  In fact we have already begun decentralizing where it seems 
to us obvious that we should, particularly in the economic 
sector. The provincial governments are already making a number 
of decisions, and this year we will experience a broader 
decentralization in the economic sector. 
  Now on the issue of north dominating south or vice versa -- 
some people may choose to view it like that, but I do not see 
any domination. Let us be very cold; let us take, for instance, 
a place near the Mozambican capital such as Gaza Province, where 
the president of the Republic, the first Frelimo chairman, the 
second Frelimo chairman and first president of the Republic, 
come from. Is there any industry in that area? There are some 
cashew nuts industries, which are paralyzed, and a rice peeling 
industry. In Cabo Delgado, however, where there was no industry 
before independence, now there are textile and marble 
industries, and the graphite industry is already in an advanced 
stage, and there is already a big cotton complex in Montepuez, 
and there is the Pemba harbor. It is not possible now to 
enumerate everything accomplished by this government. We could 
talk of Massingir but the reconstruction of that infrastructure 
began in the colonial era. Gaza has nothing! I do not see 
anything there. In what way is the south dominating the north? 
I would have said the same concerning Niassa Province if the 
infrastructures had not been paralyzed by war. You will recall 
that the biggest poultry farm in the country was scheduled to be 
built in Niassa, and the pavilions are still there, paralyzed. 
The biggest livestock feed factory is scheduled to be built 
there. The nation's breadbasket would be in Niassa with a 
project of 400,000 hectares, and this was in the north. There 
were no 400,000 hectares in the south. There are no Morrua and 
Marropino mines in the south; those are in Zambezia. The gold 
mines are in Manica Province, and all of these are new things, 
developed after independence. 
  Concerning people who are part of the government, the 
secretary general of the party is from Sofala Province and 
belongs to the Ndau tribe. The defense minister is from the 
north. The south is not a monolithic unit. The prime minister 
is from Inhambane, but he was not born in the capital of the 
province. He is from one of the districts, not from Maputo or 
Gaza. The education minister is not from the south; he is from 
Manica Province. His tribe is not Ndau or Sena; he is a Manica, 
and no one speaks of this tribe. The minister of culture is not 
from the south, but from the north. He is a Macua. Now, what 
domination are we talking about? In terms of education and 
health all perspectives are turning more and more toward the 
provinces.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] must win the 
April election in South Africa to prevent the "Boers" and the 
"Casspirs" [armored vehicles] from returning to Owambo to renew 
their fight against the inhabitants. This "revelation" was made 
this past week by Mr. Sam Nujoma at Okahao in the Omusati region 
when he addressed inhabitants during the opening of the new 
Rurtel telecommunications project. At the official launch of 
the project he deviated from his speech and said that SWAPO 
[South-West African People's Organization] is prepared "to cross 
the Orange River with weapons to bury the minority government in 
Pretoria." He then used the occasion as a platform to collect 
donations for the ANC and to request Namibians to donate money, 
goats, sheep, cattle, fowls, clothes, necklaces, earrings, 
peanuts, and mahangu [expansion unknown] for the ANC, to ensure 
the fall of the "settlers" [preceding word in English]. 
  According to him Friday's [4 February] activities coincided 
with the end of SWAPO's solidarity week with the "suppressed and 
suffering" people of South Africa. The solidarity week was 
announced in Windhoek by President Nujoma on the 27 January and 
ended on Friday. Mr. Nujoma disqualified the SWAPO government 
as an impartial observer of South Africa's transitional process. 
"SWAPO cannot be neutral," he said. "We are right behind the 
suppressed people of South Africa, under the ANC leadership." 
According to Mr. Nujoma, SWAPO has achieved its goal. "It has 
committed itself to fighting alongside other African 
nationalists for the liberation of their respective countries." 
He said that South Africa is presently being suppressed by 
"settlers". "We will fight against them. We will even cross 
the Orange River with weapons to fight the Boers. We can do it." 
  The president apparently reconsidered a few moments later 
and 
added: "It is not necessary anymore to cross the Orange River 
with weapons to end apartheid. It is just expected of us to 
give whatever we have to the ANC because elections will be held 
on the 26, 27, and 28 April. We, mostly SWAPO members, have a 
duty to perform and I want everyone present to give something. 
If you do not have money, give a fowl, give a mahangu, give 
peanuts. Ngandjeras do grow peanuts for a living. Women, go and 
fetch all the peanuts in your grain elevators and give it to the 
ANC. Give a goat, give a sheep, give cattle. I know that the 
chief of the Ongandjera has already donated a cow. I know 
people have been affected by the drought. Cattle have died and 
goats also, but if you don't have anything else bring your 
necklaces, earrings, watches, and rings. The fowl, the goat, 
the sheep -- bring it directly here. The ANC representative 
should not leave empty-handed. We want to see the Boers in 
South Africa fall." 
  The ANC local representative sharing the platform with Mr. 
Nujoma applauded.

  [Text] Harare Feb 14 SAPA -- Ethiopian ambassador to 
Zimbabwe, Fantahun Michael, on Monday [14 February] confirmed 
his government is making a formal application to Zimbabwe to 
extradite former President Mengistu Haile Mariam. He told the 
ZIANA news agency: "I know it's in the process. But I don't 
know if the application has been formally lodged with the 
Zimbabwe Government." Zimbabwe Foreign Affairs Minister Nathan 
Shamuyarira could not be reached for comment. 
  Mr Michael told a press conference last week his government 
had been angered by recent statements by Mr Mengistu in which he 
defended his rule in Ethiopia and blamed unnamed members of his 
ruling circle for his overthrow, claiming they had been paid by 
"imperialist circles". The Zimbabwe Government also expressed 
displeasure at the statements. 
  Mr Mengistu was granted political asylum in Zimbabwe with 
his 
wife and children about 30 months ago on condition he did not 
engage in any political or public activity.

  [Text] Zimbabwe says it will not send troops to join 
peacekeeping forces in Liberia because the United Nations is not 
offering enough money to cover the operation. The country's 
defense minister, Mr. Moven Mahachi, said today that Zimbabwe 
has already lined up a battalion of soldiers for duty in Liberia 
at the request of the United Nations but they will not be 
deployed unless more money is made available. Zimbabwe has 
troops with UN forces in Somalia and Mr. Mahachi said his 
government had learned from experience that the money available 
for the Liberian exercise was just not enough. 
  He said America had put up 31 million dollars for 
Zimbabwean, 
Ugandan, and Tanzanian troops due to go to Liberia and argued 
that the United Nations should approach other countries for more 
funds. Ugandan and Tanzanian troops have already been sent to 
join a Nigerian-led peace-keeping force in Liberia under the 
terms of an accord signed between rival Liberian factions in 
July last year, to put an end to a brutal civil war that began 
in December 1989.

  [Text] President Henri Konan Bedie yesterday received 
several foreign personalities, including OAU Secretary General 
Salim Ahmed Salim and Sierra Leone Foreign Minister Abbas Bundu. 
Doukoure Amadou reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Amadou] It was the former executive 
secretary of the Economic Community of West African States 
[ECOWAS] and presently foreign minister of his country, Sierra 
Leone, who was the last foreign personality to bid farewell to 
President Henri Konan Bedie yesterday at 2100. After the 
audience, Abbas Bundu stated that he had been sent by Captain 
Valentine Strasser to attend late President Houphouet-Boigny's 
funeral and then congratulate President Henri Konan Bedie on his 
assumption of office of president. 
  [Bundu, in English fading into French translation] First and 
foremost, I was asked by my head of state, Capt. Valentine 
Strasser, to bring greetings to His Excellency President Bedie, 
to renew the felicitations conveyed to him on his assumption of 
the office of president of this great country. My president 
also asked me to convey to the government and people of Cote 
d'Ivoire, the condolences of the government and people of Sierra 
Leone on the death of Houphouet-Boigny. The Sierra Leonean 
people join the Ivorian people in sharing the pain inflicted by 
the death of the late president. I was also charged with 
informing the president concerning what is happening in the 
subregion. Last November, the war had almost ended in Sierra 
Leone, so the government decided to decree a unilateral 
cease-fire and grant amnesty to the rebels. 
  Thus, a cease fire came into effect on 1 December, which was 
to last 30 days. Unfortunately, instead of a reduction in the 
war effort, the war intensified. The rebels took the 
opportunity to replenish and strengthen their positions by 
receiving arms from Charles Taylor of Liberia. 
  [Amadou] A few hours earlier, President Henri Konan Bedie 
had granted another audience, this one with the secretary 
general of the OAU. President Bedie discussed the upcoming OAU 
summit, which will take place in Tunis in June, with Salim Ahmed 
Salim. 
  [Salim, in English fading into French translation] The 
president and myself discussed the heritage left by President 
Houphouet-Boigny, not only to Cote d'Ivoire, but also to Africa 
as a whole and the possibility of continuing this struggle which 
President Houphouet began -- the struggle to improve the 
continent's economic situation, the fight to resolve conflicts 
in Africa, and the fight to maintain the dignity of our people. 
  [Amadou] Is there already an idea of the major issues to be 
discussed at the Tunis summit? 
  [Salim] By the time of the summit, the elections scheduled 
for South Africa will have already taken place. So there willl 
be a new government in South Africa and it is most likely that 
South Africa will become a member of the continental 
organization at this summit. So the issue of decolonization and 
apartheid in Africa will be over. 
  We shall then have to focus attention on issues of economic 
development, economic integration, and issues relating to the 
African Economic Community. We shall discuss what should be 
done concerning inter-African cooperation, subregional 
cooperation, and also we shall discuss the issues of stability 
and security -- since we cannot speak of economic development 
within an environment of chaos and anarchy. 
  [Amadou] Both audiences took place in the presence of the 
Ivorian Foreign Minister Amara Essy. [end recording]

  [Text] Ndjamena, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Chad President Idriss Deby 
told Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi that an international 
court decision over a contested stretch of desert was the start 
of a new era of relations between the two countries, Radio Chad 
said Thursday [10 February]. 
  In a message to al-Qadhdhafi, Deby said the decision to 
award 
the land to Chad was "not the victory of one party over another 
but the triumph of law." 
  Libya has made no official comment since the February 3 
decision of the International Court of Justice at The Hague to 
award Chad the disputed Aouzou strip, a 114,000 square kilometer 
(45,600 square mile) strip of desert. The court decision, which 
both countries agreed would be binding, was aimed at ending a 
22-year-old dispute over the area. 
  Deby said the decision marked "not only the end of a long 
dispute, but the start of a new era of trust and friendship 
between the Libyan and Chad peoples," the radio reported. 
  Deby's message for al-Qadhdhafi was given to a visting 
Libyan 
delegation Tuesday headed by Army Secretary General Abderamane 
Assaid [name and title as received], the radio added. Assaid 
also gave Deby a message from al-Qadhdhafi, the contents of 
which were not revealed. 
  Libya occupied Aouzou, the only town in the strip, in 1972, 
citing an unratified treaty between Italy, Libya's former 
colonial power, and France.

  [Excerpt] State President F.W. de Klerk says he does not 
see the election being postponed although this could 
theoretically be possible. Mr. de Klerk was speaking at a news 
conference in Pretoria a short while ago. Johan Claasen reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Claasen] According to Mr. de Klerk the 
refusal by certain political groups to participate in the 
elections could theoretically lead to a postponement. He does 
believe, however, that support for an election on the 27 April 
is sufficient to assure that it will take place. He called on 
all parties to register for the elections as soon as possible. 
He said that even though time is extremely limited there is 
still room for negotiation. 
  [De Klerk, in English] Practicality suggests that we are now 
talking merely about reaching agreements within a few days, at 
the most a week, and calling Parliament together rather soon. 
  [Claasen] Referring to the demands of King Goodwill 
Zwelithini, Mr. de Klerk says there will be definite proposals 
on the table on Thursday, which hopefully, will be acceptable to 
the king. [passage omitted] [end recording]

he was convinced the democratic process had the full support of 
the majority of SADF members. 
  He was not worried about certain elements who wanted to 
cling 
to outdated policies as they would not affect the support the 
SADF was already giving to the negotiation process.

  [Text] Pretoria Feb 15 SAPA -- The mostly black racial 
composition of the National Peacekeeping Force was unacceptable, 
the defence sub council of the Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC] has found. According to a summary of the sub-council's 
deliberations presented to the Executive Council on Tuesday, the 
Executive Management Committee has mandated a sub-committee to 
examine the problem. 
  The sub-council said the South African Defence Force had 
explained that without conscription there were no riflemen to 
draw upon and that new defence force recruits had not completed 
their training. 
  The sub council said practical solutions had to be found to 
rectify the racial composition if the peacekeeping force was to 
play a positive role in ensuring peaceful transition. 
  A joint Executive Council, defence force and defence sub 
council team is expected to finalise the peacekeeping force's 
budget by next week.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "South Africa: A Nuclear Nightmare"] </F>
  [Text] New details of the government's nuclear partnership 
with Israel and its efforts to design sophisticated nuclear 
weapons capable of devastating civilian populations as far away 
as Lagos and Nairobi are contained in a series of official 
documents in AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL's possession. The documents -- 
transcripts from the secret trial of a South African Air Force 
officer and from the government's classified submissions to the 
International Atomic Energy Authority [as published] (IAEA) -- 
show that much vital information has been kept from the public. 
They also show that President Frederik de Klerk's statement to 
parliament on 23 March 1993 that the government had built then 
destroyed just six crude nuclear devices fell far short of the 
whole truth. 
  The sophistication of the securocrats' nuclear ambitions in 
the 1970s and 1980s was grotesquely at odds with the disarray 
and venality among the government officials involved in the 
project, as evidence given in the secret trial of Air Force 
Brigadier Johann Blaauw in 1987-88 at the Supreme Court in 
Capetown makes clear. 
  Classified documents from the trial obtained by AFRICA 
CONFIDENTIAL trace how Brig. Blaauw, who negotiated a deal with 
Israel for the supply of tritium (a key ingredient required to 
make thermonuclear weapons) fell out with former Minister of 
Labour and Mines Fanie Botha. Blaauw claimed that Botha had 
promised him diamond concessions in Namaqualand, on South 
Africa's western seaboard, in return for his work on the nuclear 
programme but then failed to deliver. Botha denied this but 
said that Blaauw had threatened to make public details about the 
nuclear programme and the alleged improprieties linked to it. 
By the time of their falling out, Botha had incurred 
substantial debts and had his assets sequestrated following his 
resignation from ministerial office and parliament on 15 
November 1983 after some highly critical press reports. 
  In November l984, the police in Pretoria arrested Blaauw on 
charges of attempted extortion against Fanie Botha and 
possession of secret data concerning the Koeberg nuclear power 
reactor. However, Blaauw was acquitted in September 1988 and he 
is still pursuing his claim for the allegedly promised mining 
concessions through the civil courts. 
  Blaauw had an exemplary Air Force career which began in 
World 
War II and included service with Western forces in Palestine, 
the Korean War and the Berlin airlift. Following his retirement 
from the Air Force in l975, Blaauw was the messenger in some of 
Pretoria's most sensitive military transactions with Israel. 
  It is difficult to see how De Klerk, who took over the 
mining 
portfolio from Botha, would not have been briefed about the 
tensions between Botha and Blaauw and the nature of Blaauw's 
work on the nuclear programme with Israel. 
  In fact, De Klerk testified at Blaauw's trial, saying that 
Fanie Botha, a political rival, approached him after a cabinet 
meeting and told him he had been in the process of awarding a 
mining concession to Blaauw and asking if a way could be found 
to grant it. There is absolutely no evidence linking De Klerk 
to the illicit transactions surrounding the nuclear programme 
and sources close to the highest levels of government have told 
AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL that De Klerk got in and out of the ministry 
as quickly as possible. By the end of the 1980s, De Klerk was 
said to be unable "to come to terms philosophically" with the 
securocrats' plans to develop thermonuclear weapons whose 
primary target would be African civilians. 
  However, De Klerk's apparent "road to Damascus" on the 
nuclear weapons programme still has not facilitated a full 
admission of the extent of the government's nuclear programme. 
This lack of frankness about the nuclear programme concerns 
senior officials in Western governments particularly at a time 
when South Africa is negotiating a delicate transition where the 
loyalties of some senior officials in the security forces appear 
uncertain. 
  Blaauw's errand to secure tritium from Israel is 
significant: 
Tritium is a gas used to boost the power of nuclear weapons 
creating fusion or thermonuclear bombs. In information 
submitted to the IAEA, which monitors compliance with the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) for the United Nations, 
the government admitted that its weapons programme had involved 
lithium-6 separation, a means of producing tritium. So 
sensitive is this information that senior African National 
Congress (ANC) officials, some of whom will be holding 
ministerial office after the April elections, have been refused 
access to it. 
  According to a September 1993 IAEA document obtained by 
AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, the programme had also progressed by the 
early 1980s to planning a 150 megawatt reactor capable of 
producing tritium and plutonium. The reactor, which was to have 
been built at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay, never got beyond the 
basic engineering preparations. But Pretoria continued to work 
on developing thermonuclear weapons until 1985 or l986, 
according to Wynand de Villiers of Pretoria's Atomic Energy 
Corporation and Roger Jardine, the ANC's science policy 
coordinator. Pretoria began dismantling its nuclear weapons 
programme in 1990, in preparation for signing the NPT the 
following year. 
  In his 24 March 1993 speech De Klerk also insisted that "at 
no time did South Africa acquire nuclear technology from another 
country." Apart from United States intelligence reports 
attesting to Israeli-South African nuclear collaboration, 
additional information would have been available to De Klerk, 
during his tenure at the Mines Ministry, to indicate that 
tritium production is the result of a highly sophisticated 
technology, one which South Africa had not mastered. 
  At his trial, Blaauw testified that he negotiated for the 
supply of 30 grammes of tritium from Israel in exchange for 600 
tonnes of "yellowcake" (uranium oxide). The tritium-yellowcake 
exchange deal is described in some detail in a recent book by 
William E. Burrows and Robert Windrem. ("Critical Mass" by 
William Burrows and Robert Windrem (Simon and Schuster) 1994) 
They write that the sensitive arrangements were jointly 
overseen by South Africa's then intelligence agency, the Bureau 
of State Security (BOSS) and the Israeli intelligence division 
Lish Ka le-Kishrei [as published] (Lakam) which specialised in 
nuclear and technological procurement and came to public 
attention when it was linked to the Jonathan Jay Pollard spy 
scandal in the USA in 1985. 
  Blaauw testified at the trial that he had established South 
Africa's Israeli connection through a South African who had 
emigrated to Israel. In this way Blaauw was able to make 
high-level military contacts in Israel. Initially the two men 
arranged the emergency supply of South African spare parts for 
Mirage aircraft, needed by Israel after the 1973 war. 
  Then Blaauw arranged a deal with an Israeli front company in 
Wiesbaden, Germany, through which he obtained British tanks and 
Browning machine guns for South Africa, according to the trial 
documents. Finally, Blaauw said he was approached by one 
"Binyamin" of Lakam (almost certainly Binyamin Blumberg, chief 
of Lakam between 1957 and 1981), who asked if South Africa would 
sell Israel yellowcake which can be enriched to make fuel for 
nuclear weapons or power reactors. 
  Through his service in South African military liaison during 
the Rhodesian war, in which he took part in many joint covert 
activities with Salisbury and helped set up a meeting between 
white leader Ian Smith, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and 
South African Prime Minister John Vorster, Blaauw became a 
confidant of General Hendrik van den Bergh, then head of the 
security police -- and subsequently the head of BOSS. He told 
the court that he then approached Van den Bergh with Lakam's 
request and Van den Bergh got the go-ahead for the deal from 
John Vorster. In April 1976 Vorster visited Israel and signed a 
comprehensive set of military and economic cooperation pacts. 
  According to Burrows' and Windrem's book, Israeli and South 
African officials, including director of Lakam Binyamin Blumberg 
and then Information Ministry Secretary Eschel Rhoodie travelled 
as escorts on the twelve flights which brought the tritium -- 
2.5 grams at a time -- to South Africa. Small as the quantity 
was, it would have been enough to make one bomb every six weeks. 
  Piet Koornhof, Minister for Mines at the time the yellowcake 
deal was struck, was replaced by Fanie Botha in a Vorster 
reshuffle. Fanie Botha's interest in the Defence portfolio was 
known by Vorster: Blaauw testified that arrangements were made 
for Botha to tour secret Israeli military installations in 
preparation for his elevation to the defence portfolio. Blaauw 
said he handled the details of Botha's itinerary and accompanied 
him to Israel. 
  Botha was a hit with the Israelis. "Look after Fanie Botha," 
Blaauw's contact in Israel told him. He explained to the court 
that Israel wanted to keep Botha at the Mines Ministry until the 
yellowcake shipments were complete. After that, they were eager 
for him to become Defence Minister, hoping that he would be more 
cooperative than Pieter W. Botha, who held the post at the time. 
  Blaauw testified that he began diverting funds to Fanie 
Botha 
from a US$1 million "gift" he had received from Israel. The 
objective was not to sweeten Botha, Blaauw explained, but to 
keep his political career from being destroyed by mounting 
personal debt. 
  Botha's trusted administrative secretary Frances Peter van 
Ravensway Whelpton, however, was an outright crook. He pocketed 
all but Rand [R] 110,000 ($34,000) of the R. 420,000 that Blaauw 
provided for Botha between 1977 and 1980. The funds were 
channelled through Whelpton so that Botha would not know the 
source and to distance him from the source, which was kickbacks 
from Pretoria's arms deals with Israel, according to Blaauw. 
Additionally, Blaauw admitted making small payments to 
Whelpton, who apparently conceived and facilitated the grant of 
mining concessions on state-owned land (Sea Areas 1 and 2 on the 
West Coast) to Blaauw's company Ondombo Beleggings which 
precipitated the fall out with Botha. Whelpton pleaded guilty 
to extortion and illicitly possessing state secrets and was 
sentenced to five years in prison. It was several months before 
Blaauw realised that Botha was slow to hand over the mining 
leases because those areas had already been promised to others. 
  As an interesting sidenote, two senior officials from Anglo- 
American submitted testimony to the trial. According to the 
presiding judge's interpretation of the testimony of Harry 
Oppenheimer (Chairman of Anglo-American from 1957 to March 1983) 
was that Oppenheimer undertook to do what he could to assist 
Fanie Botha and in fact had an interview with Tertius Myburgh, 
the editor of the SUNDAY TIMES, as a result of which no 
information about Fanie Botha's financial position was published 
in that newspaper [sentence as published]. 
  However, the judge's interpretation is at variance with 
Oppenheimer's recollection of his testimony. Oppenheimer told 
AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL on 2 February 1994 that although he had no 
control over what was published in the English press in South 
Africa he had "said he would pass on to Myburgh what Botha had 
told him. He subsequently told Myburgh the substance of his 
conversation with Botha, but he did not ask Myburgh whether he 
intended to publish any story relating to the Minister's 
affairs. Myburgh did say he was aware of rumours surrounding 
Minister Botha's affairs, and that these were being investigated 
by his reporters. Oppenheimer did not ask, nor did Myburgh 
undertake, not to publish any information regarding Botha's 
financial position." According to Oppenheimer. nothing was 
published about Botha at that time for fear of libel. 
  The current Chairman of Anglo American, Julian Ogilvie 
Thompson, has given his version of the events surrounding the 
applications for the mining rights on Namaqualand sea areas l-5. 
Blaauw testified that he had disputed with Ogilvie Thompson 
about which concessions Anglo American should pursue. Ogilvie 
Thompson has told Africa Confidential that he first met Blaauw 
in June 1979 in Anglo American's offices where Blaauw "advised 
De Beers (Anglo American's sister company) of a change in the 
Namaqualand sea areas from discouraging to encouraging 
applications for rights to prospect for diamonds." De Beers 
subsequently applied for mining rights in sea areas 1-5 but the 
forms were mislaid. Ogilvie Thompson says that the last time he 
met Blaauw, who he says was trying to negotiate the concessions 
for himself, was in March 1980 at a rendezvous on the N1 
highway, when he gave Blaauw a duplicate set of the mining 
rights applications which were to be delivered personally to the 
Minister. Ogilvie Thompson added: "No payment was asked for or 
made by De Beers to any person in connection with these 
applications." 
  The Namaqualand sea areas 1-2 were awarded to State Alluvial 
Diggings and UK-based Selection Trust Company respectively, and 
sea area 3 to US-based Sedco. Areas 4 and 5 went to De Beers: 
Setrust, Sedco and De Beers have subsequently joined together 
in a joint venture. 
  In 1981, after attempting to secure the promised leases by 
legal action, Blaauw joined by Whelpton began to pressure Botha, 
who in turn began lobbying the Van Winsen Committee which had 
begun reviewing the leases. According to the court documents, 
Blaauw and Whelpton also began threatening to expose how, during 
the power struggle sparked by John Vorster's fall in the 1978 
information scandal, Fanie Botha, a weak contender for the 
succession, agreed that Blaauw should eavesdrop on the phones 
and conversations of some his rivals including Foreign Minister 
Pik Botha, De Klerk, I.S.J. Schoeman, A.J. Raubenheimer, and A. 
P. Treurnicht. 
  Blaauw and Whelpton also planned to allege publicly that 
Fanie Botha plotted with them to implicate two National Party 
MPs in illegal diamond transactions, according to testimony in 
the case. Another alleged plan, to circulate stories in 
Parliament about a sex scandal involving Pik Botha, also made 
its way into the court record. More seriously and perhaps a 
harbinger of the corruption exposed in the 1990s, the court 
entered as evidence a document, which according to Blaauw 
testimony, contained a list of Swiss bank accounts opened by 
senior officials in the government. The document passed through 
the hands of Whelpton and Blaauw, although it is not clear for 
what purpose. 
  When Blaauw threatened to release this information, Botha 
called in the police, who began taping telephone calls and 
meetings. Botha, who never flatly confirmed or denied that he 
had granted the concessions, later admitted to Judge G. Friedman 
that he had erased parts of the tape of his meetings with Blaauw. 
  Friedman cleared Blaauw of extortion and appeared convinced 
that Fanie Botha had promised him the concessions in July 1979. 
It was proper for Blaauw to have the classified document 
concerning Koeberg's fuel requirements, ruled Friedman, because 
he was working closely with Wynand de Villiers, director of the 
Atomic Energy Corporation, to obtain enriched uranium for the 
reactor.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Need To Look at Question of Regional Autonomy -- 
Johannesburg 
THE STAR in English on 16 February in a page-14 editorial 
believes Mangosuthu Buthelezi is "using the Zulu king Goodwill 
Zwelithini, to advance the Inkatha Freedom Party' [IFP] demand 
for greater regional autonomy." The "latest ploy" is 
Zwelithini's threat "to proclaim the restoration of the 
independent 19th century Zulu kingdom." THE STAR notes that 
secession has long been "a catalyst for war." "Buthelezi may be 
raising the secessionist option to persuade De Klerk to agree to 
greater power for the regions and to induce him to lean on the 
ANC [African National Congress] to concur. There is a real 
risk, however, that secession will acquire its own momentum and 
drag South Africa into the abyss." De Klerk's response has been 
to insist that Zulu demands for "`self- determination'" can be 
"fulfilled within the Interim Constitution." But there is 
dissatisfaction with the constitution which "extends beyond 
Buthelezi and the king. They would not have been able to muster 
thousands of Zulus to protest in Pretoria last month and Durban 
on Monday if there was not genuine unease. For that reason it 
is imperative to look again at the question of regional 
autonomy." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Call for Entrenching Regional Powers -- A page-16 editorial 
in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 16 February comments 
on the IFP dissatisfaction with the constitution, saying "the 
solution still lies in extending and entrenching regional powers 
-- especially to kwaZulu/Natal and rural subregions, where they 
may prove tempting to reasonable white rightwingers." BUSINESS 
DAY points out that a year earlier a University of the Western 
Cape academic had proposed "a Natal divided into three regions. 
Buthelezi could then at least hope to win a regional poll in 
northern Natal where he and the Zulu kingdom have traditionally 
been based (contrary to Zwelithini's claim to the whole of 
Natal)." This proposal is "worth exploring." The National 
Party is "sufficiently flexible," but the ANC "may see further 
concessions as distasteful. But the choice lies between this and 
accepting that a new government will be preoccupied for years 
with a major regional security problem, absorbing resources 
which should be directed at the main priority of reconstruction 
and development." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Criticism of IFP Nonparticipation in Election -- 
Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 16 February in a page-8 editorial is 
"impressed" by the respect that Zulus or members of the IFP have 
for their king, Goodwill Zwelithini. However, having said that, 
SOWETAN finds it difficult to understand that the king and his 
people should be "so emotional about the coming elections." "We 
still think the IFP and those who support King Zwelithini should 
have taken part in the elections [as published]. They would 
have done their standing in the eyes of the world enormous good 
if they had. We have less sympathy with other members of the 
Freedom Alliance, who do not have half the type of support shown 
to the Zulu king in Pretoria and Durban." 
<H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>
  Time To Stop Talks With Right Wing -- Johannesburg CITY 
PRESS 
in English on 13 February in a page-14 editorial warns that the 
coming election "bodes ill for us all," due to the Afrikaner 
National Front's (AVF) decision to boycott the election and 
their talk of a "`little bit of violence'" to stop the election. 
"Now that the rightwingers have made it plain to all of us that 
no matter what concessions they are given, they were merely 
using negotiations to dismember the country and are prepared to 
use force to achieve their goals, we must question the wisdom of 
continuing talks with them."

  [Excerpt] Brazzaville, 15 Feb (AFP) -- The deployment of 
the intervention force set up to monitor the cease-fire in the 
southern districts of Brazzaville is facing "logistic and 
financial difficulties," military sources said here today. The 
force was initially scheduled to have been deployed in the 
southern districts yesterday, but the exercise was postponed for 
24 hours "on technical grounds." 
  The High Command of the Congolese Armed Forces and the 
command of the intervention force met again today to examine 
"the logistic and financial difficulties" which are hindering 
the deployment of the 400-man-strong force. By late this 
afternoon, no new date had been announced for the operation. 
  According to a reliable source, differences surfaced over 
the 
selection and distribution of members of the force, which should 
include 200 pro-opposition and 200 pro-Lissouba men. This 
report was, however, not confirmed by military sources.

  [Text] Brazzaville, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Police fired in the air 
Tuesday [15 February] to disperse a demonstration by pupils of 
the Chaminade high school here protesting against identity 
checks introduced by the school administration. 
  No one was hurt in the firing, which caused the pupils to 
retreat to their classrooms. Police then sealed off the school, 
situated some 500 metres (yards) from the home of President 
Pascal Lissouba. The students said they would go on strike 
Wednesday if the identity checks, said to be for security 
reasons, were not stopped. 
  The Chaminade, one of Brazzaville's leading schools, has 
more 
than 2,000 students.

<F P=106> [Article by Marie-France Cros: "An `Incomprehensible' </F>
Blockage: The United Nations Clashes With Presidential 
Supporters Who Want Amnesty"] 
  [Text] Once again, the establishment of the transitional 
government and assembly, as provided for in the peace agreement 
between the Rwandan Government and rebel forces that was 
concluded in August 1993, has been postponed. Nonetheless, last 
Thursday, UN Envoy Jacques Booh Booh had reached a consensus 
between all the parties concerned to proceed Monday with the 
establishment of these transitional institutions, even if the 
two wings of the Liberal Party [PL] could not agree on who would 
represent them within these institutions. Originally, the 
transitional institutions should have become operational on 31 
December 1993. 
<H5>  Empty Seats </H5>
  On Sunday, the former single party, the National Republican 
Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] did not turn up at 
the meeting planned by MINUAR (the UN Mission in Rwanda -- LA 
LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note), nor was the Hutu branch of the 
PL, led by Justin Mugenzi, who has brought off a spectacular 
reconciliation with both President Habyarimana and the MRND in 
recent months. Consequently, the meeting had to be postponed 
and, as a result, the institutions could not be set up on 
Monday, as planned. "We do not understand this blockage," said 
MINUAR spokesman Gueye. 
  Gueye added that the MRND "had nevertheless wanted to 
present 
a code of conduct for the parties at the meeting, stating that 
they undertake to vote in favor of a general amnesty, and ensure 
the neutrality of the administration" during the transitional 
period leading up to the elections scheduled to be held around 
20 months from now.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ambassador Ahmad Hajjaj, OAU </F>
assistant secretary general, in Addis Ababa by Shihatah 
Abu-al-Majd in Cairo; date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Abu-al-Majd] How will the recent fighting 
between troops belonging to General Mohamed Farah Aidid and 
those belonging to General Morgan affect the reconciliation and 
accord process in Somalia? 
  [Hajjaj] Any fighting in Somalia is unfortunate because it 
will necessarily affect Somali security, on which the 
international community has spent a lot of effort and money. 
Any aggression against organizations operating in Somalia, 
particularly UN troops, should be condemned strongly. The whole 
world is watching Somalia as the deadline for the withdrawal of 
international troops nears. Any fighting or any injury among the 
UN or other international relief agency workers will trigger a 
bad reaction. The international community will be dissuaded 
from granting relief aid to the Somali people, who have suffered 
enough as a result of the infighting. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Observers believe that the recent fighting 
might have been the prologue for large-scale fighting, since the 
Somali factions are now stockpiling weapons to prepare for the 
withdrawal of most Western troops by 31 March. Do you agree 
with this view? 
  [Hajjaj] Yes. Many signs indicate that some Somali factions 
are currently mobilizing and arming their troops to engage in 
further fighting and bring further destruction to the Somali 
people. This is what international observers fear, the OAU 
included. As I said before, the international community has 
spent a lot of money and effort in Somalia. If the Somali 
factions continue to fight among themselves and if the 
subsequent displacement of hundreds of thousands of people and 
the destruction of the infrastructure continue, the 
international community will not pay the issue the same 
attention it is giving it now. The leaders of the Somali 
factions should realize this is a serious matter, and the 
reasonable Somali people must prevent such massacres. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] What role will the OAU play in the coming 
stage 
to prevent such infighting? 
  [Hajjaj] The OAU maintains contacts with the Somali 
factions. 
It welcomes any contact from these factions to establish peace 
and stability in Somalia. We urge the African states that have 
troops operating in Somalia not to withdraw these troops, 
because African states have committed themselves to help the 
Somali people. We do not want African states to withdraw their 
troops like other non-African states. Moreover, the Somali 
factions must stop the fruitless infighting. No faction will be 
left to take charge of the ruling process if it thinks that more 
fighting will allow it to strengthen its position. Certainly, 
other factions will emerge to resist it. Accord must prevail 
among all Somali factions. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] With the approach of the date of the Western 
troop withdrawal from Somalia, are you coordinating with the 
United Nations so that Western troops can be replaced by African 
or Islamic troops? 
  [Hajjaj] There are contacts between the OAU and the United 
Nations. This coordination can be enhanced. As you know, the 
OAU ministerial council emphasized in its latest meeting that 
there should be constant coordination between the OAU and the 
United Nations. Our goals are the same even though our 
resources are not. The joint goal is to establish peace and 
stability so that the long-overdue reconstruction process can be 
launched. The longer this process is delayed, the less 
attention the international community pays to the Somali issue. 
There are other world problems that command world attention, 
like the former Soviet republics, the former Yugoslavia, and 
others. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks in Lusaka, the capital of 
Zambia, are moving slowly but also progressing. Today the 
United Nations and the troika of observers presented a new 
document on national reconciliation to the sides. The contents 
of the document are not known, but it is known that it is the 
result of points of view presented by the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the government. 
  The two sides held meetings with the mediators this morning 
and once again this afternoon. Although no diplomat has made 
statements to the press, the countenance of the negotiators was 
described as encouraging. Observers have said the issue of 
national reconciliation in Angola, a country at war for more 
than 30 years, is not an ease issue to deal with. However, UN 
Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye still believes in a 
solution for this delicate point. UNITA also believes in this 
and hopes that Luanda, which has not yet made concessions, may 
do so to achieve peace and democracy in Angola. Thus, the ball 
is on the side of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party.

  [Text] Government troops in Angola are said to have won 
back three towns in the country's northern province of Bengo. 
However the government newspaper, JORNAL DE ANGOLA, says 
government troops are under heavy guerrilla pressure in Caxito, 
some 50 km from the capital, Luanda. The paper said today that 
the northerly towns of Nnambuangongo, Ucua, and Ambriz fell to 
the army after fierce battles with UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] rebels which began in mid-January, 
but it gave no casualty figures. 
  Independent sources in Luanda said there was still heavy 
fighting in the border regions between Bengo, more than half of 
which is in government hands, and Uige Province, wholly held by 
UNITA. 
  In the southernmost province of Huila, where army-rebel 
clashes have broken out, a military spokesman in the chief town, 
Lubango, said troops had recaptured the iron mining town of 
Jamba, after a five-day fight to dislodge UNITA units, which 
overran Jamba on 3 February.

  [Text] Harare Feb 15 SAPA--Zimbabwe Foreign Affairs 
Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said on Tuesday [15 February] the 
government was not aware of any application by the Ethiopian 
Government to extradite former dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, 
the ZIANA News Agency reported. Mr Shamuyarira said in an 
interview that if an application was made, the government would 
consider it. 
  "We have not seen the application yet. The position is that 
we are still unhappy about statements made by (Mr) Mengistu. We 
expressed our displeasure about it to him," he said. However, he 
said he did not know of any statute that would compel Zimbabwe 
to hand over Mr Mengistu to Ethiopia. 
  Ethiopian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Fantahum Michael on Monday 
said his government was processing a formal application to 
Zimbabwe to extradite Mr Mengistu. This has been sparked off by 
recent statements by Mr Mengistu in which he defended his rule 
in Ethiopia and blamed unnamed members of his ruling circle for 
his overthrow, claiming they had been paid by "imperialist 
circles".

  [Text] The preparations for negotiations are currently in 
place at Ouagadougou, where delegations of the Niger Government 
and the Tuareg opposition have arrived for a technical meeting 
to fix a timetable for negotiations to end the Tuareg conflict 
in Niger. The dispute has been going on for nearly three years 
now. Yesterday evening, the head of state received the two 
delegations separately. Each audience lasted about one hour. 
Today, the Burkinabe envoys are pursuing their discussions with 
the two delegations in order to establish a working program 
likely to bring everyone around the same table. Radio Burkina 
contacted the leaders of the two delegations who showed optimism 
about the effective takeoff of these trilateral consultations. 
  Kriska, of the Coordination of Armed Resistance, which 
includes all the Tuareg movements, says this slowdown is caused 
by technical problems. A few modifications need to be made, 
however that these are not necessarily preconditions. As for 
the head of the government delegation, Abdourahamane Hama, who 
is Niger's foreign affairs and cooperation minister, the 
consultations remain informal because this enables them to 
proceed prudently. Both claim that a joint meeting is probable 
either this evening or tomorrow morning.

  [Text] Parliament has approved a resolution extending the 
state of emergency declared by the president, Flight Lieutenant 
Rawlings, on Thursday [10 February] in seven districts of the 
Northern Region from seven days to three months, in accordance 
with Article 32, Clause 4 of the Constitution. Moving the 
motion at today's sitting, the minister of interior, Colonel 
Osei-Wusu, explained that since the declaration of the state of 
emergency, there have been reports of wanton killings of babies, 
women, and unarmed persons. He said that it is now obvious that 
some of the groups involved in the fighting are bent on causing 
more carnage. 
  Col. Osei-Wusu said the current situation is such that the 
state of emergency must continue to enable the task force to 
achieve its objectives of ensuring the cessation of hostilities 
and disarming the combatants. Parliament appealed to the 
soldiers engaged in the peacekeeping exercise not to act on 
their emotion but to use diplomacy, dialogue, and minimum force 
in the execution of the peacekeeping mission.

  [Text] Monrovia, l5 Feb (AFP) -- Liberia's rival factions 
began fresh talks here on Tuesday [15 February] to try to 
overcome political and military problems which have for months 
blocked implementation of last year's peace agreement. The main 
sticking points are disarmament of the various armed groups and 
the setting up of transitional institutions ahead of elections 
supposed to be staged this month. 
  U.N. special envoy Trevor Gordon Somers is chairing the 
latest closed-doors parley. A marathon six-week session which 
opened in December made no progress. Delegates said they 
regarded the new discussions as a "last chance" to sort out 
their differences. 
  The interim government is at loggerheads with the main rebel 
movement the Patriotic Front and its rival United Liberation 
Movement, which are both insisting on getting the key ministries 
of foreign affairs, defence, justice and finance. 
  The new round of talks is being attended by General John 
Inienger, commander of the military monitoring force of some 
l9,000 troops stationed in Liberia by the 16-nation Economic 
Community of West African States since August 1990.

  [Text] High school and university students have once again 
erected barricades this morning throughout the streets of 
Bamako, preventing motorists from going about their normal 
duties. Our colleague, Braimah Camara, who is back from town 
after an on-the-spot assessment, reports. 
  [Camara] High school and university students have indeed 
ransacked some areas of the capital. Groups of students 
attacked basic education Minister Adama Samassekou's residence 
and the external wall was partially broken down. In 
Lafiabougou, the residence of our colleague Daouda Tekete, 
technical adviser to the basic education minister, was 
completely ransacked and burned down together with the furniture 
and equipment inside it. Still in Lafiabougou, Mrs. Tekete's 
private clinic was ransacked. The villa where the clinic is 
located was seriously damaged and working instruments carried 
away. Tension was very high this morning at the ADEMA [Alliance 
for Democracy in Mali] headquarters in Bamako III. Here ADEMA 
youth met spontaneously at the party headquarters and some 
articles were broken. The ECHO newspaper building was visited 
by a handful of students who were forced to give up in the face 
of the workers' determination to preserve their equipment. 
According to evidence we managed to gather there, some students 
tried again to attack the Cheick Anta Diop High School owned by 
Professor Cheikna Modi Cissoko and here they ran into a 
contingent of security forces. This is what we were able to 
observe this morning in the capital.

  [Text] Lagos, 15 Feb (AFP) -- The police Tuesday here 
sealed off the scheduled venue for a press conference by Beko 
Ransome-Kuti, the president of the Campaign for Democracy (CD), 
the umbrella body for human rights and pro-democracy groups in 
Nigeria, witnesses said. More than 40 police were deployed at 
Nigeria Union of Journalists House before the arrival of 
Ransome-Kuti, preventing him and others from entering the 
conference hall, the witnesses said. The human rights activist 
later read the text of his speech, in which he called for the 
immediate resignation of the regime of Sani Abacha, in front of 
the hall to a crowd of journalists and human rights activists. 
  The blockade was the second time in a month that the police 
tried to prevent a press conference in the same hall. On 
January 13, Chief Arthur Nzeribe, the leader of the Association 
for Better Nigeria, a pro-military group, was prevented by 
police from addressing the press at the same venue. 
  Ransome-Kuti criticised the regime of General Abacha, who 
came to power in November after ousting the then civilian head 
of state, Ernest Shonekan. The human rights activist accused 
the present military leadership of "corruption," insincerity and 
political "gimmickry." The constitutional conference being 
planned for this quarter by the regime was a ruse by the 
administration to "consolidate its hold on political power," he 
said. He described some members of the National Constitutional 
Conference Commission, set up last month to prepare the 
conference as "bandits and discredited politicians." 
Ransome-Kuti called for the immediate resignation of Abacha's 
regime and the handover of power to a national government which 
would convene an alternative national conference. "We shall 
henceforth consult, organise and mobilise Nigerians against 
dictatorship", he stated. 
  Meanwhile it was reported that General Shehu Musa Yar'adua, 
a 
former deputy head of state in the late 1970s, had been arrested 
last weekend by security agents. Yar'adua last month called on 
Abacha not to stay in power beyond December 31. The arrest, 
reported by the local press, has yet to be officially confirmed.

  [Text] The general staff of the Togolese Armed Forces [FAT] 
has categorically refuted allegations that the forces were 
responsible for the obnoxious and gratuitous murder of three 
persons including a member of the Action Committee for Renewal 
[CAR] who had just been elected to the National Assembly. The 
FAT believes that the sole purpose of these accusations is to 
tarnish its image. Kouakou Tovie has more details. 
  [Tovie] The FAT's reaction, published today by the Army 
headquarters in a statement of clarification, reads as follows: 
  For some time now, it has become common practice for those 
whose objective has always been to discredit, divide, and 
destroy our Army, to make gratuitous allegations against the 
FAT. Any time a man in military uniform commits a crime, 
evil-minded and unscrupulous persons blame such crimes on the 
security agencies, and yet everyone is aware that on several 
occasions the law and order agencies have arrested organized 
groups dressed in Army uniform, who were involved in criminal 
activities such as armed robbery, murder, hold-ups, sabotage, 
and terrorist attacks. More than once, such criminals have been 
arrested and turned over to the Justice Department. It will be 
recalled that searches carried out in the residences of some 
politicians on 10 and 31 January led to the discovery of fatigue 
dresses and green and red berets. 
  The FAT, which remains committed to its traditional mission 
of protecting the territorial integrity of the country, warns 
all those who use military uniform to indulge in criminal 
activities with the intention of denting the image of the Army 
against such action. The forces reiterate their commitment to 
democratic principles and to their desire to live in peace and 
total harmony with all other sections of the population.

  [Text] In Togo, the opposition is in the frontline. Mr. 
Agboyibor's Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] has decided to 
suspend its participation in the electoral campaign in protest 
against the assassination of three of its members, including a 
deputy who was elected in the first round of the elections. The 
CAR will not rescind its decision unless the security of its 
members is totally guaranteed. Olabire da Cruz, who is in Lome, 
explains the issue to Africa No. 1. 
  [Begin Cruz recording] Confirming the decision made by his 
party's steering committee following a long meeting, CAR 
Chairman Yaovi Agboyibor stated that this suspension will remain 
in force until security is guaranteed for all candidates. 
According to him, this is not possible for two of them at 
present. Already, by early yesterday evening, the CAR's 
decision was rather foreseeable, especially as this party and 
its ally, Edem Kojo's party, had withdrawn from the state media 
program arranged by the Ad Hoc Audiovisual Communications 
Commission for 14 February. The Rally of the Togolese People, 
the former single ruling party, therefore participated in the 
program alone. All the same, it will not be surprising to see 
CAR rescind its decision very rapidly. 
  Meanwhile, after vehemently condemning last weekend's 
assassinations, the International Committee for Monitoring the 
Ouagadougou Agreement did not hide its concern and fear for the 
consequences that this act may have on the democratic process. 
It therefore appealed for the restoration of confidence among 
the various parties and hoped that security measures will be 
taken as soon as possible. 
  Similarly, the Togolese Armed Forces [FAT] categorically 
denied any implication in last weekend's assassinations. In a 
statement, the FAT headquarters said that immediately a group of 
people in military uniform does anything wrong, some 
ill-intentioned and unscrupulous voices are raised and attribute 
this to the security forces. A strong warning was sounded to 
all those who use military uniforms to commit reproachful acts 
in a bid to stain the honor of the Army. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Comunique issued by the Rally of the Togolese People in </F>
Lome on 15 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] The Rally of the Togolese People has learned with 
strong indignation of the sordid kidnapping and the savage 
assassination of Gaston Edeh, an Action Committee for Renewal 
[CAR] member, who was recently elected member of parliament for 
the second Yoto constituency. This tragedy raises various 
questions, including this one: Who benefits from this crime? 
At any rate, it neither benefits democracy nor honors the 
people and even less the RPT which has always fought against 
violence as a means of political expression. 
  The RPT strongly condemns this horrible assassination of 
peaceful citizens including an elected representative of the 
people. The RPT demands an inquiry to determine the exact 
circumstances of this tragedy. The participants should be 
brought to trial so that they may be judged and severely 
punished to the fullest extent of the law. How can Togolese 
resort to such barbarous acts at a time when the entire Togolese 
people are mobilized for the completion of a long process of 
democratic transition in order to put an end to its suffering. 
  The RPT presents its condolences and expresses its sympathy 
to the bereaved families and bows with sadness and emotion 
before the mortal remains of the victims. The RPT appeals to 
the population to be more vigilant in order to foil all 
Machiavellian maneuvers of those whose sole ambition is the 
conquest and exercise of political power whatever the price. 
The RPT invites the entire political class of our country to 
show moderation and tolerance so that this last phase of the 
political competition can be carried out with dignity and with 
respect for the adversary, and in peace and security to 
guarantee the best chances of functioning for the Republican 
institutions. 
  Signed Ayite Gachin Mivedor, national chairman of the 
campaign committee.

  [Text] Five days to the second round of legislative 
elections and there is a return to political violence in Togo. 
It is perhaps in an attempt to ward off excesses of this kind 
that a meeting was convened today. It was attended by members 
of the National Electoral Commission [CEN] and members of the 
various political parties. Gege Adjavon reports. 
  [Begin Adjavon recording] In effect, conscious of the tense 
atmosphere in which the candidates and political parties are 
preparing for the second ballot, the CEN deems it fit to seek 
together with party leaders the means and ways of preventing or 
reducing significantly the irregularities that marred the first 
ballot. Mr. Sipohon Kue Gaba, the NEC chairman, believes that 
although the successful outcome of the ongoing process will not 
solve all the problems, it constitutes an important and 
indispensable stage for the establishment of the institutions of 
the Fourth Republic. 
  Mr. Sipohon Kue Gaba did not keep mute over the 
assassination 
of the deputy-elect for Yoto, Edeh Gaston Aziandouvo as well as 
two other members of the Action Committee for Renewal. This 
odious and sordid act, condemned by the whole political class 
and the entire Togolese people cannot go unpunished. In 
collaboration with the government, the CEN will do everything in 
its power to contribute to the search for the culprits. At the 
beginning of this meeting, the leaders of the 13 political 
parties present and CEN members observed a minute's silence in 
memory of those who died as victims of terrorist acts and 
political crimes aimed at destabilizing the public authorities 
and preventing the successful outcome of the ongoing democratic 
process. A prayer was also said at the beginning of this 
meeting. [end recording]

  [Text] Lome, 15 Feb (AFP) -- A bomb exploded at Notse (100 
km north of Lome) last night, at the home of Sevald Afchandao, a 
Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] candidate who was beaten in 
the first round of the legislative elections held on 6 February, 
it was learned from police sources. The attack, which was 
unclaimed, caused no casualties. The explosive was placed in an 
uninhabited area of the house which also houses the offices of 
the national education service. A second bomb, which was 
planted under a broken-down car parked a few meters away from 
the house, did not explode. 
  This attack comes a day after the discovery in Lome of the 
bodies of a deputy and two members of the Action Committee for 
Renewal who were assassinated after they were abducted on 13 
February by men in military uniform. The killing of these three 
people a week before the holding of the second round of 
legislative elections, has been condemned by the entire Togolese 
political class opposed to President Eyadema.

  [Text] Durban Feb 15 SAPA -- The African National Congress 
[ANC] on Tuesday [15 February] condemned Monday's hints of 
secession by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, saying his demands 
for an autonomous Zulu state came directly from the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP]. ANC Southern Natal Regional Secretary Sbu 
Ndebele said Monday was "a sad day for the Zulu-speaking people 
of South Africa", because it saw the Zulu monarch taking a 
"radical decision" which had not been tested by popular vote. 
  He said King Zwelithini had singled out IFP President 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi as "God's gift to the Zulu people", which 
was an "inconceivable position" since royalty was not supposed 
to be politically aligned. "The majority of the king's subjects 
do not belong to the IFP. The Zulu nation is not a single, 
monolithic bloc united in its support for a partisan political 
policy," he said. 
  The ANC was currently drafting its own proposals for the 
Natal provincial constitution and the monarchy would "take pride 
of place" in that constitution. 
  The ANC charged that Mr Buthelezi had used the king for 
party 
political purposes, adding that the ANC would entrench the 
king's independence in a provincial constitution "so that his 
place doesn't depend on the whim of the governing party and the 
king will be enabled to play a unifying role to all the people". 
  On Monday King Zwelithini told State President F W de Klerk 
at a meeting in Durban that acceptance of the Zulu nation, as it 
existed in the 1800s, was not negotiable. He said the Zulu 
nation was a sovereign one and could not be overruled by the 
interim constitution. Mr de Klerk said he did not regard the 
king's claims as secession and said the government would 
officially respond to them on Thursday.

  [Excerpt] Negotiations among Nigerois resumed this 
afternoon in Ouagadougou. The Coordination of Armed Resistance 
-- which includes all the Tuareg movements -- and a Niger 
Government delegation were received in turn by President 
Compaore in the early evening. The first group to arrive in the 
country was the eight-member Tuareg delegation and were the 
first to be received by President Compaore. The half-hour 
audience granted to each group enabled them to remove the final 
obstacles and pave the way for the beginning of a new round of 
talks at the same table scheduled for 15 February. There was 
much optimism at the end of the meeting. The Niger Government's 
position was put forward by the Niger foreign minister. 
Abdourahamane Hama, who is leading the government delegation, is 
interviewed by Yannick-Laurent Bayala. He thinks that 
everything is ready for the resumption of talks with the Tuareg 
rebels. 
  [Begin recording] [Hama] This is indeed a great moment for 
Nigerois. We finally have this opportunity here in Ouagadougou 
to discuss a problem which is very vital to our country's future. 
  [Bayala] Can the meeting effectively begin on 15 February? 
  [Hama] We think that as far as the Niger Government is 
concerned there is no reason why the meeting should not begin. 
  [Bayala] How can you be sure of that? 
  [Hama] I think that for now, we will not discuss the problem 
in detail for now. Negotiations need to be prepared. The fact 
that we will be meeting to see how we will proceed in the coming 
months and weeks to solve the problem is already a big step. 
The Niger Government is prepared to find a solution to the 
problem; President Mahamane Ousmane said so when he took office 
and he reiterated that at the United Nations. I think the fact 
that such an important government delegation, including at least 
five or six ministers, and high-ranking members of Air and 
Azaouak are here in Ouagadougou is an important sign of our 
goodwill. 
  [Bayala] President Mahamane has met Tuareg traditional 
rulers. Does it mean that the different sides have finally got 
to the point where they have set aside their differences in 
spite of the recent violence? Several people have recently 
died from that. 
  [Hama] I think that contacts and dialogue between the two 
sides were never broken off. Today, we are simply formalizing 
that dialogue to solve the problem in concrete terms. 
  [Bayala] The Tuareg delegation leader, Mano Dayak, speaks of 
the magnitude of the problem and reaffirms his delegation's 
willingness to find a negotiated solution. 
  [Dayak] Our problem is a regional problem and it should be 
seen in that light. We are pleased about efforts being made by 
Burkina Faso to find a solution to the problem as soon as 
possible. 
  [Bayala] Mr. Mano Dayak, several opportunities have been 
missed. Will this one be grasped? 
  [Dayak] There have certainly been several missed 
opportunities in Ouagadougou indeed but that was not the 
resistance's fault: We were the ones who suggested that the 
first meeting should be held in Ouagadougou. There were 
definitely problems which have made it impossible for us to meet 
here up until now. We are here now and that is the main thing. 
We can now say that things are really going to get under way. 
  [Bayala] There has been fresh violence lately in Niger and 
the government has blamed it on the Tuareg resistance. Do you 
deny responsibility? 
  [Dayak] The truce ended at the beginning of June. We are, 
therefore, unfortunately in a war situation. We are sorry about 
that, but we hope that there will be a solution and we are ready 
for that. I think if there is a conflict or if tension resumes 
in the subregion, no one can be blamed or criticized for that. 
We would like to put an end to that situation. We are calling 
on the Niger Government to embark on frank and sincere dialogue 
as soon as possible to end these kinds of actions. 
  [Bayala] Mano Dayak, people are very much in favor of 
Algerian and French representatives taking part in the 
Ouagadougou negotiations. 
  [Dayak] The Algerian Government has always been involved in 
various negotiations and discussions. Algeria is part of the 
subregion and wants to find a solution to the problem. Right 
from the beginning it has endeavored -- just as Burkina Faso is 
doing now -- to find a solution. It will be involved in ongoing 
negotiations as one of the observer countries. 
  [Bayala] Just like France? 
  [Dayak] Yes, France will be present at the negotiation as a 
mediator. We did not come to Ouagadougou for the negotiations 
proper. That will take some time. It is a technical meeting to 
determine which countries will be mediating, what the future 
political negotiations will be, and where they will be held. 
France and Algeria will be certainly involved in the 
negotiations. The coordination's demands will be contained in a 
document which we will publish in Ouagadougou. This is very 
important for us because our problem is an African one. We 
would therefore like to find a solution within and African 
context and Ouagadougou is an ideal place for that. We will be 
demanding a minimum of rights for our people who have always 
been marginalized in Niger. They should now be entitled to the 
same rights as other Niger communities. That is what we are 
calling for now, otherwise there will unfortunately be no peace. 
We are calling for regional autonomy for the whole community 
politically and economically. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 15 SAPA--The Conservative Party 
[CP] has come out in support of King Goodwill Zwelithini's 
demands for recognition of a Zulu kingdom and an own 
constitution for the Zulu nation. "This is a justifiable claim 
giving expression to the aspirations of his people," said 
Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg. 
  Signing himself as transitional Volksraad [National 
Assembly] 
president, Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement on Tuesday the 
interim constitution did not accommodate such expression and 
therefore offered no lasting political solutions for South 
Africa. "The Afrikaner nation's demand for freedom and 
self-determination in its own republic with its own constitution 
is also a justifiable claim which needs to be addressed," Dr 
Hartzenberg said. 
  These demands would have to be accommodated in a future 
constitutional dispensation for peace and prosperity.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo by </F>
Monique Mas; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Ngendahago] For the sake of the security of our 
citizens, we agreed to open up the cabinet a bit more widely 
than we had envisaged to enable all Burundians to live in 
security. I think the first aim that we in the government are 
following is to stop the massacres so that all Burundians can 
feel safe. Afterward, we will see. 
  [Mas] Nevertheless the result of opening up is that Uprona 
[Unity for National Progress], the former sole party, has got 
what would elsewhere be called the Ministry of the Interior--in 
other words, questions of internal security--and, furthermore, 
we are seeing the entry of people who were behind the recent 
bloody events in Bujumbura. Some people are talking of 
capitulation by the Frodebu [Burundi Democratic Front], the 
party in power. 
  [Ngendahayo] Uprona hasn't got the interior portfolio. There 
is a minister of the interior in the government team. What it 
is is territorial administration. That is a nuance that should 
be added. 
  Then there has not been any capitulation. Rather we have 
opened up as was necessary, in a strategic move, to enable there 
to be an all round relaxation of tension. If for the safety of 
our citizens we have to deal even with parties who have no 
representation at all in the National Assembly, but with whom, 
for everyone's safety, we have to discuss and cooperate, why 
not? We are quite open to discussion and to power sharing, if 
it is for the good of the country and its citizens. 
  [Mas] What weight did the Army have in this choice? In this 
opening up? 
  [Ngendahayo] Officially, the Army did not play any role. 
Now, at the level of realpolitik there are certainly 
negotiations going on in this same direction, because you have 
to face up to reality: if there have been problems in Burundi, 
it started on the night of 20 to 21 October, and everything 
started off at certain military camps. So we are bearing all 
these parameters in mind. 
  [Mas] The night of 20 to 21 was the night of the attempted 
coup, which led to the death of the elected president, Melchior 
Ndadaye. In the end this coup seems to have benefited certain 
members of Burundi political circles? 
  [Ngendahayo] After the death of the head of state, and after 
the death of some very highly placed state officials, we had to 
reconstruct the government, which had completely collapsed. To 
emerge from our places of hiding, we had to have discussions 
with our political partners, who had not suffered reprisals, and 
to try now to find a new way of governing the country, bearing 
in mind all the problems we have just experienced. 
  This is why you are seeing a repetition of what President 
Ndadaye, in his great magnanimity, did, and what we are doing in 
our great sense of realism. 
  [Mas] In specific terms, what might the program of this new 
government be? 
  [Ngendahayo] I think there is basically to be a continuation 
of the program that arose from the June elections. This cannot 
be refused, and, more importantly, it is inevitable. But at 
first, before reaching the point where this program can be 
followed, there has to be a period where we will work first of 
all to restore peace, to restore trust between citizens, and for 
national reconstruction. These are extremely important things. 
And in this context we have to bring back the refugees, 
numbering nearly 1,000,000, who have swarmed into Rwanda, and 
who are in Zaire and in Tanzania. 
  [Mas] In this do you still need foreign support, of a 
military nature, in particular the kind the OAU envisaged? 
  [Ngendahayo] Yes indeed, in as far as when you talk to the 
refugees, they say: We want a successor to Ndadaye -- and they 
have got that -- but they add: We want his successor to be 
protected and have his physical person guaranteed. We don't 
want the same causes to produce the same effects, they say. And 
so there is a very important effect from a psychological point 
of view, that the OAU mission should be there in military form, 
to contribute to the security of the head of state, and of 
certain dignitaries, so that the country's own forces of law and 
order can gradually take over. 
  [Mas] How do you envisage the political future of Burundi? 
  [Ngendahayo] I think the political future of our country 
depends on the goodwill of politicians in Burundi. Therefore I 
think there is an appeal that has to be made, namely to make 
politicians realize that they have to keep in their minds the 
fact that the most important thing is not so much obtaining 
ministries as preserving peace. Second, we must not conceal the 
true values of democracy, or forget that we, in Frodebu, are in 
power thanks to elections that came out of a quite proper and 
decent political process, which was the pride of the whole of 
Africa. Seen like this, the achievements of June 1993 are 
something very important, which we have to bear in mind for the 
future.

  [Text] Libreville, 15 Feb (AFP) -- Father Paul Mba 
Abessole, Gabon's main opposition leader, today called on his 
followers to "refuse to pay" local taxes and "disobey all 
government directives." 
  In a statement to the press, Father Mba Abessole, who placed 
second in the 5 December presidential elections and contested 
President Omar Bongo's reelection, also reaffirmed the 
determination of his party, the National Lumberjacks Rally, not 
"to participate in any other local or national election" 
organized by the government, since the ballot paper has no value 
at present in Gabon." 
  In this regard, the Lumberjacks leader sees yesterday's 
announcement, that local elections slated for March 27 have been 
postponed to 28 August, as a "retreat imposed" by the 
government. Father Mba Abessole also invited opposition members 
who have rallied round him in the Convention of the Forces of 
Change "to reject any form of participation in a government of 
national union or large consensus," which President Bongo has 
called for several times since his reelection. Those who "join 
such a government would by that very fact be excluded from our 
ranks," he warned.

  [Excerpt] The Gabonese Trade Union Confederation [COSYGA] 
has expressed its determination to go ahead with its planned 
three-day general strike starting today to press for concrete 
measures to cope with the soaring prices caused by the 
devaluation of the CFA franc. The workers are also pressing for 
an 80-percent wage increase. Prime Minister Oye-Mba held talks 
with union leaders on 14 January and told them that his 
government was examining further measures designed to alleviate 
the adverse effects of the devaluation through the subsidization 
of certain basic commodities. [passage omitted] 
  [In a related report at 1215 GMT on 16 February 1994, 
Libreville Radio adds: "The 72-hour strike called by COSYGA 
seems to have received little support. The movement was not 
very much observed and Libreville residents in particular are 
quietly going about their normal business, both in the public 
and private sectors." 
  [Libreville Radio says that the personnel officer for the 
Libreville municipal council said the following: "Reports 
reaching me from the region say that the strike has only been 
partially observed. I am happy to report that a large number of 
our employees have come to work."]

Sudanese People's Liberation Army [SPLA] on Zaire's involvement 
in the Sudanese conflict. In a document that has just been 
handed to the news desk of La Voix du Zaire, General Eluki Monga 
Awundu says that Zairian territory does not serve and will not 
serve as a base for the incursion of foreign troops to settle an 
internal problem that does not concern Zaire. The problems 
between the SPLA and the Sudanese Armed Forces are purely 
internal to the Sudanese people, the document added. It 
concluded: The Zairian Armed Forces do not intend to support 
either of the two forces and urge the Sudanese to settle their 
problems like brothers.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good evening. The negotiators are holding lengthy 
talks in a bid to find common ground concerning the general 
principles for national reconciliation. At this stage, the 
mediators virtually have no idea of how to approach the third 
version of the general principles because the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] continues to say no to 
discussing legal issues. 
  After this afternoon's session, sources reported that there 
were many areas of agreement. There are no agreements yet 
concerning general national reconciliation principles because 
UNITA does not want to discuss the legal side of the dossier. 
Both the government and the mediators believe that the dossier 
should be discussed both along political and legal lines. 
  The mediators and the observers have undertaken to work with 
the UNITA team this evening in a bid to settle the problem. 
They will attempt to persuade UNITA to accept discussions that 
can always fall back on the country's existing legal framework. 
  A source said that if the mediators manage to get UNITA to 
agree to that, perhaps there might be an agreement on the 
general principles of national reconciliation by tomorrow. That 
source noted, that the issue of the general national 
reconciliation principle is just the first part of the dossier. 
In a clear reference to the issue of the ministerial portfolios 
and specific national reconciliation principles, that source 
said that heated talks are on the way. They will try to do away 
with possible loopholes to avoid any complications when those 
principles are implemented. [end recording]

  [Text] The desire of all the Angolan people at this period 
is to see the the adoption of a significant agreement in Lusaka 
which will once and for all end war in Angola. Under the UN 
mediation, the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] and the Luanda regime are discussing important 
issues connected with the existing problems in the country. 
  Peace talks continue in Lusaka and according to our sources, 
there are positive developments. Also according to our sources, 
the mediators presented a 10-point [as heard] document to the 
two parties yesterday. Four of the points have already been 
agreed upon by the two delegations. The remaining points are 
once again being reassessed by the mediators. 
  Dr. Jorge Valentim, a member of the UNITA delegation to the 
peace talks, has been cited by news agencies as having expressed 
optimism over the recent phase in the peace talks. According to 
our source, Dr. Jorge Valentim said there is trust between the 
two delegations and a positive conclusion of the peace talks 
could be obtained in Lusaka. 
  The discussions in Lusaka center on issues connected with 
national reconciliation [words indistinct] the future UN role in 
Angola.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Progress at the Lusaka peace talks is piecemeal and 
with too many breaks. The mediator and the troika of observers 
succeeded in having the two sides agreeing to four of the five 
[as heard] points of the second document under discussion. The 
four points are: general principles on political tolerance, 
nondiscriminatory coexistence of all ethnic groups, the 
involvement of all Angolans in the process of national 
reconciliation regardless of their political, ethnic, and 
religious origin, and the adoption by the news media of a 
behavior that conforms with patriotism and a unitary state. 
  This afternoon's plenary session was scheduled to deal with 
the only outstanding issue, but it was replaced by separate 
consultations because the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola introduced a proposal that the government 
delegation rejected outright.

  [Text] Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola, MPLA chairman, today granted an audience 
to the African National Congress, ANC, team led by ANC Executive 
Committee Member Tokyo Sexwale, who delivered an oral message 
from ANC leader Nelson Mandela. The MPLA chairman took the 
opportunity to express the MPLA's solidarity with the ANC as it 
prepares for multiracial elections in South Africa. The 
audience was also attended by MPLA Secretary General Lopo do 
Nascimento. 
  Tokyo Sexwale believes that the name of Savimbi is becoming 
synonymous with something evil. Addressing a news conference 
this afternoon shortly before leaving the Angolan capital, that 
ANC official noted that his party will not allow South Africa's 
elections to result in a bloodbath. 
  [Begin recording] [Sexwale, in English with Portuguese 
translation in subtitles] We support the talks that are taking 
place right now in Lusaka between the various parties from 
Angola but, in supporting those talks, we want to make it 
absolutely clear that in our view, and in the view of 
correctness, those talks that are taking place must not overlook 
the fact that elections have taken place here and some people 
did win those elections. The defeat of the Angolan elections, 
which were the outcome of the popular opinion of the people here 
is the defeat of the elections that will take place tomorrow in 
South Africa. 
  You asked me a question about Mr. Savimbi. He is an old man. 
He is an Angolan. He has been on the run for too many years 
now. The appeal is to give his people a chance. Around the 
world, the name Savimbi has come to be known as a name 
representing some form of evil but, as an African, I think he 
should work toward a situation where one day the name Savimbi 
can be associated with reconciliation. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Is there not the danger that 
Buthelezi or Terreblanche might become another kind of Savimbi 
in South Africa? 
  [Sexwale] I think until right now, we are also....[pauses] 
We 
have made an appeal to those people in the right wing in South 
Africa, both black and white, the ultra rightwing, like Mr. 
Buthelezi, like Terreblanche, even at this late hour, when we 
have completed negotiations, we appeal to them to (?seriously 
join) the process for elections on 27 April. But I must 
indicate that, in support of those negotiations that are taking 
place and in support of the defense of the elections, I think we 
want to point out that we, in South Africa, have always held the 
MPLA as our friend. In Zimbabwe, we once held the organization 
of Mr. Nkomo as an ally, but they lost elections and we accepted 
the will of the people of Zimbabwe (?behind) Mugabe. We accept, 
therefore, the will of the people of Angola behind the MPLA.

aircraft of the World Food Program and hit one of its wings. 
After carring out a mission in the province, the Boeing 727 
aircraft was shot at as it was returning to Luanda, where it 
made an emergency landing. We learned on the site that it will 
take some time before repair work can be carried out. UNITA is 
intensely shelling the city of Malange.

  [Text] The military command of Zaire Province's Zone No. 1 
today accused the Luanda government of infiltrating agents into 
areas controlled by the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] through the Republic of Zaire. A 
communique issued by the military command says some of the 
agents have entered Cabinda through the Chimbuande border post 
in Lower Zaire, while others have crossed the Matadi and Boma 
border posts toward M'banza Congo. The intention is to cause 
unrest behind UNITA lines and to link up with units of the 
People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] 
involved in the Bengo offensive. 
  Details of the enemy plans were gathered from an agent 
captured by the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FALA]. Agent (Ndombasse Garcias de Jesus Vicente) was trained 
in Cuba and integrated a five-man sabotage team. He said the 
operation is backed by Zaire's intelligence services in 
coordination with the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA- PT] embassy in Kinshasa. The military 
command says the agents were behind the recent attacks on 
fishermen in Quissanga. 
  The Northern Front's General Staff has advised the Zairian 
Government not to let its territory be used as a springboard for 
attacks on UNITA as this would internationalize the conflict. 
FALA says it will not tolerate any provocations, though 
measures have been taken to prevent any incidents. The 
communique reiterates UNITA's willingness to establish and 
strengthen good relations with all its neighbors. 
  Meanwhile, FALA's Eastern Command today denied reports 
carried by the government-controlled JORNAL DE ANGOLA according 
to which UNITA was attacking FAPLA positions. The command says 
the report fits within the framework of communist regimes' 
strategy of fabricating evidence. The source noted that Luanda 
wanted to convince the world that UNITA was involved in a 
general offensive, but when the MPLA-PT regime realized that 
relief operations depended on security, the Eduardo dos Santos 
group changed its tune and called for aid from every quarter. 
The fact is that there has never been any clashes in the 
region. UNITA has assured the World Food Program and other 
relief agencies that they can safely distribute aid in areas 
controlled by the MPLA or in UNITA-administered territory. The 
source added that independent sources can confirm the situation.

  [Text] Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], has reiterated that the 
UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] should be blamed if war 
resumes in the country. Ngonhamo, who was speaking to 
Mozambican journalists in Nampula yesterday, accused Lelio 
Goncalves, former commander of Unomoz forces, of having been an 
office general. 
  [Begin Ngonhamo recording] This simply means that in all the 
12 months he has been in Mozambique, he was an office general. 
He did not know, administer or control his soldiers. He does 
not know what the Unomoz soldiers in Mozambique did. First of 
all, the Unomoz soldiers are involved in a generalized sexual 
corruption with minors and this is a crime against humanity. 
Mr. Lelio Goncalves was never able to halt this situation. The 
Unomoz soldiers are using helicopters in their corrupt actions, 
they take girls wearing only bikinis by helicopter to the beach 
in Ponta do Ouro and Inde in Cabo Delgado and other beaches in 
Mozambique. The Unomoz soldiers even abuse the code of roads of 
our country, they frequently run over Mozambican citizens. The 
United Nations directorate in Mozambique has nothing to do with 
the Mozambican population. So, my words are valid for the 
Mozambican people who are tired of war, but for a Unomoz soldier 
who is here today and tomorrow leaves for his country, this does 
not mean anything, whether Mozambicans die or face difficulties, 
it does not matter for them. [end recording] 
  Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo went as far as to accuse a Russian 
Major (Lopes), who is part of the Unomoz, of being an 
infiltrator, working for the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo], and of inciting war to maintain the weapons business. 
  [Begin Ngonhamo recording] For instance, during the 
investigation of the Nihia issue regarding area number two, when 
soldiers were found in the area, a Russian Major came along who 
is part of the Unomoz, named (Lopes). When they were drafting a 
document to confirm the existence of soldiers in the area number 
two, he said the government might be right because it presented 
area number two as an assembly area. Our officials told them 
that this is not possible because Frelimo has 29 assembly areas 
and area two has not been mentioned as one of the 29 areas. If 
Frelimo has 30 assembly areas, why is area number two a secret? 
It has not been mentioned by the government in its assembly 
area lists. There is no doubt that this is intended to create 
confusion, this is a Russian officer in the Unomoz who does not 
want to see Frelimo condemned for its mistakes. My assessment 
of the situation is: I believe a number of soldiers infiltrated 
Unomoz and want the war to resume in Mozambique to facilitate 
the weapons business with Frelimo, and such is the case of this 
Russian officer. This is a dangerous situation. How can this UN 
officer maintain peace in this way, since he is encouraging 
people to violate the peace process so that the war resumes in 
the country. [end recording]

  [Text] General Eduardo da Silva Nihia, first secretary of 
the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party in Nampula, has 
accused the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] of trying, 
through obscure methods, to find a pretext to resume war in 
Mozambique. Reacting today to the latest accusations by 
Renamo's Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, Nihia told 
journalists that he has never been involved in any plan to give 
military training to 1,000 men and 350 riot policemen in a 
training camp on the outskirts of the city of Nampula. 
  The supreme Frelimo leader in Nampula Province asked how it 
would be possible to secretly train 350 men in a big and densely 
populated city like Nampula. Gen. Nihia explained to 
journalists that the so-called Poligono-2, where troops and a 
riot police force are allegedly being trained, is being used as 
a transit point for government troops moving to assembly areas 
of Namialo and Angoche. He said the area is also being used by 
Bangladesh troops in the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] 
for their physical exercise. 
  [Begin Nihia recording] Well, I can say that the truth is 
there are no men being trained there. The men who are there are 
waiting to be moved to assembly areas in Namialo and Angoche. I 
do not know why Mr. Ngonhamo is inventing these accusations, 
citing my name. Since I was posted as the first secretary of the 
Frelimo Party in Nampula, I have never visited a single military 
unit. In Nampula I travel alone. I am never escorted. In all 
districts I have never been escorted. I move alone because I 
believe in the peace accord. I believe in the end of war. [end 
recording] 
  In view of what he described as inventions, the first 
secretary of the Frelimo Party in Nampula then said and I quote, 
Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo is not the reasonable person I thought 
he was, unquote. The Frelimo Party official in Nampula Province 
said ironically that the Maringue Military Academy, where 
Ngonhamo was trained, teaches its cadets subjects like lies, 
arrogance, and terrorism. We asked Nihia whether he would take 
legal action against Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo. 
  [Begin Nihia recording] It may go that far. If people are 
not careful, things may go that far. Gen. Ngonhamo is a citizen 
and in his capacity as a citizen he should not make false 
charges against a free citizen, as I am. It may go that far, if 
he continues with these accusations and he does not present 
concrete reasons. He will not be able to present reasons for me 
to say yes, it is true. What I am saying is what I mean. [end 
recording] 
  Asked to explain why he changed his impression of Gen. 
Ngonhamo, Eduardo da Silva Nihia said power has spoiled the 
Renamo officer who is today in the High Command of the future 
unified army. 
  [Begin Nihia recording] Ngonhamo was recently appointed as a 
member of the High Command of the future nonpartisan forces in 
the country [words indistinct]. Before being appointed, he 
[words indistinct]. Now that he has been appointed to that 
post, he thinks that he has power [words indistinct]. [end 
recording] 
  Gen. Eduardo da Silva Nihia doubted whether Ngonhamo has the 
capacity to become lieutenant general. He said it is not his 
desire to join the new army to consist of soldiers from the 
government and Renamo, but if this happens, he would not [words 
indistinct] be commanded by Ngonhamo, as long as he demonstrates 
that he is responsible and honest in his command.

  [Text] The situation remains explosive in Namialo assembly 
area, in Nampula Province, where the government soldiers with 
the former Northern Improvement Brigade [Brigada de 
Melhoramentos do Norte], BMN, and others in the Nampula 
Provincial Command continue to wait for the outcome of their 
demands. It should be recalled that last year those soldiers 
robbed goods and resorted to other disorderly behavior, 
culminating in the detention of the presumed mutiny leaders. 
  At the time (5 February) that assembly area, a few meters 
away from the station had already received 942 men who had 
already carried out their "check in" [preceding two words in 
English], of which 886 had already been registered. 
  Three of the confined soldiers have perished in differing 
circumstances. 
  Major De La Pena, head of the UN peacekeeping forces in the 
area, has reported that weapons handed over include 886 assault 
rifles (864 "AK-47" and two "FN") [figures as published], 16 
submachine guns (six "RPG", eight "RP-46", and two "DP"), 49 
pistols, three mortars (one "M-60" and two "M-82"), 12 "RPG-7" 
rocket launchers, two hand grenades, and 17 antipersonnel mines. 
  There are several diseases affecting soldiers at the camp: 
malaria (84 cases), gonorrhea (38), diarrhea (118), 
conjunctivitis (17), parasite-related diseases (32), and 
dysentery (10). 
  Namialo has no ambulance, but the seriousness of some the 
cases prompted the removal of seven patients to other health 
posts or hospitals able to afford better health care. 
  Major Domingos Pilote, liaison officer and commander of that 
government assembly area, explained that, as a result of the 
mutiny in December last year, "strong arm tactics" had to be 
used to restore discipline to the camp. The forces of law and 
order had to intervene and had wounded one of the mutineers. 
  He said that increased and more diversified food, the 
neutralization of the mutiny leaders, and constant visits by 
officials from government and other institutions were other 
measures that had been taken with a view to restoring discipline 
to the camp. 
  The government sent 270 kg of fresh fish, 150 kg of pork, 
191 
kg of dried fish, 530 kg of salt, and 650 kg of corn to that 
area between 19 and 23 December. 
  In turn, the World Food Program ferried to Namialo assembly 
area 27,609 kg of corn, 10,555 kg of rice, 3,878 kg of peas, 
4,504 kg of beans, 1,185 kg of sugar, and 2,071 kg of cooking 
oil. 
  The UN Operations in Mozambique Demobilization Technical 
Unit 
made available 978 blankets, 942 plates, 15 cooking pots, 432 kg 
of soap, and 250 kg of cement.

  [Text] The South African Trade Mission in Swaziland this 
week on Thursday [17 February] ceases to be a trade mission and 
becomes a fully fledged embassy. This, therefore, means that 
the South African trade representative, Mr. Heath, becomes the 
first South African ambassador to Swaziland, and Mr. Sam Malinga 
becomes Swaziland's first ambassador to South Africa after 
presentation of letters of credence by both ambassadors. 
Formalities to this effect will be finalized on Thursday when 
the South African trade representative meets the minister of 
foreign affairs, Mr. Solomon Dlamini. 
  Also to call on the foreign affairs minister on Thursday 
will 
be the United States ambassador designate to Swaziland, Dr. John 
Sprott.

  [Text] The government has denied reports that there is a 
rift and lack of confidence between the President and Minister 
Without Portfolio Brigadier General Godfrey Miyanda. A 
statement released to ZNBC [Zambia National Broadcasting 
Corporation] today by the government says the WEEKLY POST 
illegally obtained and published a memorandum from the president 
to Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Remmy Mushota without 
authorization. The memo was published with intent to mislead 
the nation. 
  According to the statement, the first part of the memo was 
the president's comment on General Miyanda's performance in a 
television program. The second part was referring to an unnamed 
individual in the media who was making it difficult for the 
government to disseminate information.

  [Text] Zimbabwe's minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Nathan 
Shamuyarira, says his government has agreed to a United Nations 
request for a second Zimbabwean contingent to be sent to 
Somalia. Dr. Shamuyarira said the UN had asked Zimbabwe for more 
troops because of the good work the first contingent had 
accomplished in Somalia. He said the new deployment would 
consist of about 1,000 soldiers. The UN and Zimbabwe are also 
conducting talks about sending Zimbabwean troops to Liberia.

  [Text] Thousands of workers at Zimbabwe's state run Posts 
and Telecommunications Corporation have begun an indefinite 
strike to press for higher wages. The union leader said the 
10,500 workers wanted a 12.5 percent increase which a labor 
relations tribunal has said must be dated back to July 1992. 
Many services were not available because of today's strike but 
senior staff were maintaining essential operations. The 
corporation said the strike was illegal and the workers risked 
losing their jobs. The corporation has appealed to the Supreme 
Court against the ruling by the labor relations tribunal.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] The latest reports from Ghana's troubled Northern 
Region put the death toll at over 500 after weeks of communal 
clashes between the Komkomba and Nanumba ethnic groups. A state 
of emergency has been imposed as well as a dusk to dawn curfew 
and thousands of Komkombas have fled across the border into 
Togo. In the last week, several senior figures have visited the 
region, and last Tuesday [8 February], 18 MP's from the area 
issued a statement accusing some Komkombas of being the 
aggressors and of committing atrocities. One of those MP's is 
the deputy speaker of Parliament, Mohamed Ibn Chambas. On the 
line to Accra, Ajoa Yeboah-Afari asked him what he had found 
when he visited the north. 
  [Begin recording] [Chambas] It was a major disaster. I mean, 
I traveled from Yendi to Bimbila. Virtually every major town 
along that road had been burned down. Dead bodies littered the 
entire road from Bimbila to Yendi. 
  [Yeboah-Afari] How many people would you say died in the 
conflict or have died so far? 
  [Chambas] Frankly, I cannot tell at this point. 
  [Yeboah-Afari] Would you put it in the hundreds or 
thousands? 
Some people have said thousands have died. 
  [Chambas] I would say in the hundreds, for now. 
  [Yeboah-Afari] What about the extent of destruction? 
  [Chambas] Homes have been destroyed, you know. Then, 
infrastructure, I mean, schools, small-scale businesses like 
grinding mills and shops have all been looted and burned. So, 
it is quite extensive damage economically also. 
  [Yeboah-Afari] So, who would you blame for this destruction? 
I believe the statement that you made in Parliament blamed the 
Komkombas. 
  [Chambas] It is probably not the time to, you know, point 
accusing fingers. The security forces are on the ground and 
they can identify the source of problems. 
  [Yeboah-Afari] But your statement did specifically say the 
Komkombas were believed to be the people causing the problem? 
  [Chambas] Well, what I talked about in that statement was 
what I saw. I mean, I witnessed two towns -- major towns -- on 
the Yendi-Bimbila road being burned down by one particular 
group. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The government has set up a national emergency 
committee to investigate the cause of the ethnic conflict in the 
Northern Region. The chairman of the committee is the minister 
of defense, Alhaji Mahama Idrisu. There is also a task force to 
deal with the situation in the ground and this headed by 
Brigadier Joseph Smith of the Ghana Army. The setting up of the 
committee was announced at a news briefing in Tamale addressed 
by Brig. Smith. He said although the situation is being brought 
under control, it will lead to severe famine in the region. 
Brig. Smith said life is returning to normal in Tamale. 
  Brig. Smith said the security agencies will conduct searches 
and seize arms and munitions and other offensive weapons in the 
tribal districts. He said with immediate effect, all illegal 
roadblocks in the region are to be dismantled and uncompromised 
searches of vehicles will stop forthwith. He stressed that only 
the security agencies are empowered by law to mount roadblocks. 
Brig. Smith added that the Army has the situation under control.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Alpha Oumar Konare by Muriel </F>
Pomponne in Bamako; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] Our guest is Malian head of state Alpha Oumar 
Konare. Following the recent government crisis in Mali, Muriel 
Pomponne took stock with the Malian president of the 
difficulties facing the country. For 10 days or so, Mali has 
had a new government set up around the majority party, Adema 
[Alliance for Democracy in Mali]. The other political parties, 
including the CNID [National Committee of Democratic 
Initiative], which joined the government nine months ago, have 
left. Muriel Pomponne asked President Konare whether this was 
not the failure of his policy aimed at opening up the political 
spectrum: 
  [Konare] During the electoral campaigns we advocated 
political openness. This was not a mere slogan. Of course, a 
certain number of parties have left, to our regret, because it 
is not what we wanted, and I have to say that, following the 
prime minister's resignation, it was not very welcome, given the 
scale of the difficulties. Those who remain must face up to the 
situation and believe me, they will, in keeping with this spirit 
of openness. 
  [Pomponne] There is another education crisis right now in 
Mali. Students have taken to the streets again. It would seem 
that ever since the beginning of the third republic, 
institutions and Malian students have not been able to agree. 
  [Konare] The education crisis dates back a long time before 
the third republic was born. We are dealing with pupils and 
students whose desire to see the country go forward, we do not 
doubt, because they understand that without a democratic Mali 
none of their problems can be solved. We are also applying 
ourselves to making sure that all political parties understand 
that the educational arena must cease being a target for 
political parties. 
  [Pomponne] You are also facing an economic and social 
situation which has been somewhat difficult since the 
devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc. You 
recently had the opportunity, in Yamoussoukro for instance, to 
meet the French authorities at the highest level. Did you 
receive assurances from your partners in development? 
  [Konare] We did receive assurances from them. We spoke about 
several specific actions. A social fund for development was 
announced. We would like this special fund for development to 
be managed with full Malian participation, and a maximum of 
projects to be funded. We raised debt issues which tie us to 
France, monetary debts for instance. We also raised the issue 
of certain subsidies France is willing to put at our disposal. 
The issue of African companies, of Malian companies, which deal 
with France was also raised, and I believe that all these issues 
concern our French partners. 
  [Pomponne] Did you get any positive answers? 
  [Konare] I would like to say that we got the feeling that we 
were being not only listened to, but also understood. 
  [Pomponne] Mr President, when you came to power two years 
ago, Tuareg rebels had just reached a peace agreement with the 
Malian government. Two years on, what do you make of what was 
then called the national pact? 
  [Konare] I think we still have peace, despite a few 
incidents 
here and there. The pact is undoubtedly our main asset. Of 
course, I would have liked things to go much better, I would 
have liked to get much more. This is not the case in some 
respects. But there are difficulties on the ground, 
psychological difficulties, political difficulties. We have 
identified a certain number of difficulties which I hope to iron 
out very quickly. 
  First of all, the absence of an administration on the 
ground, 
which means that specific needs of the people such as schools, 
health, and veterinary centers for instance are not being met 
very quickly. It is important for local administration to be 
got on the ground very soon. 
  There is the issue of integration into the armed forces and 
the security forces. Efforts have been made, efforts are being 
made. You know, 660 have already been integrated, including 
officers. We are going to integrate more. We are in the 
process of assessing [the number of men to be integrated]. As I 
said, some figures have been given. Some say 2,000, others 
3,000. I think that those people know that this figure is 
unrealistic given the size of our army and, as I said, we will 
never introduce ethnic or racial criteria for armed forces and 
security forces. 
  Civil servants will be recruited in order to facilitate the 
good management of the north of our country. But great efforts 
will have to be made in order to start numerous development 
programs on the ground, and it is within these development 
programs that real integration will take place.

  [Text] The first contacts between the Niger Government and 
the four movements of the Tuareg rebels opened yesterday 
afternoon in Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. The meeting 
apparently satisfied both sides. The Niger minister of foreign 
affairs welcomed the fact that the desired dialogue was becoming 
a reality. As for the chairman of the Coordination of the Armed 
Resistance, he said he was glad that the problem is beginning to 
find a solution on African soil. In fact, the discussion in 
Ouagadougou will center on one word: autonomy. Mano Dayak, 
chairman of the Tuareg Coordination, is very keen on this word. 
He spoke to Christophe Boisbouvier: 
  [Begin recording] [Dayak] We are ready to negotiate, taking 
as a starting point a document envisaging political and economic 
autonomy for the Tuareg regions--a program we consider to be 
good for the whole of Niger. If it is rejected by the Niger 
Government and other communities, however, we will demand 
autonomy and discuss it for our regions in the north of the 
country. 
  [Boisbouvier] You are talking about autonomy, and no longer 
of federalism? 
  [Dayak] Unfortunately, the word federalism frightens people 
in Niger and in Africa. If federalism frightens people, what we 
are interested in is the content. The word does not interest 
us, so we can also talk of regional autonomy, where our 
communities can manage themselves economically and politically. 
[end recording] 
  The government side appears to prefer the term 
decentralization. Niger Foreign Affairs Minister Adbourahamane 
Hama also spoke to Christophe Boisbouvier: 
  [Begin recording] [Hama] One of the political lines that the 
Constitution imposes on our government is that decentralization 
and devolution -- in other words, the taking over by peoples and 
regions of their own administration, development, and future -- 
should be effective and real. 
  [Boisbouvier] So you are ready to discuss autonomy? 
  [Hama] We are not talking about autonomy. You asked me 
whether we were willing to have the regions of Niger and the 
people of Niger administering themselves. That is what we are 
doing at the moment. We want to push this experiment forward and 
give it its full and real sense. [end recording] 
  The negotiations will deal today with the number of 
mediating 
countries, and also on the timetable and location of future 
political negotiations. Let me remind you that since November 
1991 the Tuareg question has officially left some 100 people 
dead.

  [Text] Lagos, 16 Feb (PANA) -- A retired Nigerian Army 
major general, Shehu Musa Yar'adua, has sued the military 
government of General Sani Abacha for continuing to keep him 
under detention. 
  Yar'adua, who was second in command under Nigeria's military 
regime of 1976-1979, Ibrahim Babangida, is claiming 50 million 
naira (about 229,000 U.S. dollars) in damages for his arrest and 
detention at the weekend. In the suit filed at a high court in 
Kaduna, northern Nigeria, on Tuesday [15 February], the retired 
general, described his detention as "unlawful, illegal and 
unconstitutional". Family sources said he was arrested soon 
after he arrived home from a foreign trip. 
  There has still to be an official comment on his detention, 
apart from a press statement credited to a defence spokesman in 
Lagos Wednesday. "It is the government that knows the intention 
of the detained general and it is the same government that can 
account for its actions", the spokesman, Brigadier General Fred 
Chijuka was quoted by the statement as saying. 
  The current problems Gen. Yar'adua is facing can be traced 
back to a press conference he gave on 12 January. At that news 
conference, he asked the three-month-old government of Gen. 
Abacha to hand over to a national government by December of this 
year. 
  Police authorities in Lagos reacted a day later by warning 
Nigerian politicians against "utterances capable of threatening 
government's good intention to bequeath a viable democratic 
institution in the country". 
  Pro-democracy groups have criticized the detention of the 
general, who was a leading Social Democratic Party (SPD) 
presidential candidate before being disqualified because of what 
the then military government of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida described 
as widespread electoral fraud by the aspirants. 
  Meanwhile, the retired Nigerian head of state, Gen. Yakubu 
Gowon, who prosecuted the 30-month Biafra civil war (1967-70), 
to keep Nigeria one, has stressed that the country's unity was 
not negotiable. Gowon, toppled in 1975 after nine years in 
power, told journalists in Minna, northern Nigeria, Tuesday 
after visiting former head of state, Gen. Babangida, that 
"whatever we do, this nation is more important than any of us 
and we must continue to keep it one". He condemned public 
statements that could inflame passion and hasten the 
disintegration of the country.

  [Text] Dakar, 16 Feb (AFP) -- In Dakar today, the first 
demonstration against the devaluation of the CFA franc, which 
was organized by the opposition, turned into a riot and resulted 
in one dead and dozens wounded, including security officials, 
according to casualty reports from hospital sources. 
  Hundreds of demonstrators, mostly young people, swarmed into 
the large avenues of Dakar after a public meeting organized by 
five political parties (including the main opposition party, the 
Senegalese Democratic Party of Abdoulaye Wade) to denounce the 
high cost of living after the devaluation of the CFA franc by 50 
percent last January. 
  On their route, they destroyed shops, and burned or 
destroyed 
vehicles and fuel stations, chanting slogans hostile to 
President Abdou Diouf. Policemen who tried to intervene were 
roughed up. According to witnesses, some were seriously wounded. 
  Despite intervention by members of the security forces, who 
used tear gas in dispersing them, the demonstrators suceeded in 
reaching the surroundings of the Presidential Palace. They then 
took the adjacent streets, destroying several parked vehicles. 
  Equally violent demonstrations took place almost at the same 
time in several localities in the suburb of Dakar, where 
witnesses reported extensive damage. 
  These demonstrations came in the month of Ramadan, on the 
opening day of salary negotiations between the government and 
trade unions. 
  Yesterday, demonstrators organized by the opposition were 
dispersed by security forces, who arrested about 10 people. 
  Early this evening, security measures were reinforced at 
Plateau, an administrative and business district of Dakar, as 
the demonstrators returned to their respective popular districts. 
  [At 2109 GMT on 16 February, AFP adds: "Five persons -- four 
members of the security forces and one civilian -- were killed 
during a violent demonstration today in Dakar, according to an 
official casualty report. In a communique issued this evening, 
the Senegalese Government `strongly condemned these acts of 
vandalism which cannot in any way destabilize the institutions.' 
It affirmed that those responsible for these acts will be 
hunted down, arrested, and punished according to the law"]

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Senegalese Government in Dakar on </F>
16 February] 
  [Text] The department of Dakar was the scene of violent 
demonstrations this afternoon. These incidents occurred while a 
rally for political parties grouped within the Democratic 
Coordination [as heard] was taking place. To reestablish and 
maintain order and ensure the free movement of persons and the 
protection of property, the security forces intervened in 
several districts of the department. The demonstrations claimed 
victims among the security forces. They are Moustapha Diane 
(?guardian) of the peace; Ibrahima Saib, guardian of the peace; 
Dauda Ndour, guardian of the peace; and Abou Han, guardian of 
the peace. They were all members of a mobile intervention 
force. There was a civilian victim among the demonstrators. 
Civilians were also seriously wounded. The government [words 
indistinct] before the memory of the dead, and presents to their 
families its deepest condolences. The government strongly 
condemns these acts of vandalism, which can in no way 
destabilize the democratic republican institutions that are the 
basis of a country that respects the law. It reaffirms its 
solemn determination to do everything possible for the law to 
prevail, for state authority to be reinforced further every day, 
and for the security of the public to be guaranteed efficiently 
by the law. The instigators and authors of these acts of 
vandalism and destabilization shall be sought, arrested and 
punished acording to law. Finally, the government pays tribute 
to all the security forces -- police, Gendarmerie, and the 
National Army -- for their acts of determination and patriotism. 
The government expresses [words indistinct] renews support in 
the accomplishment of their noble mission in the service of the 
nation.

  [Text] Freetown, 16 Feb (AFP) -- Thirty-eight civilians 
were killed on the morning of 15 February during an attack by 
United Revolutionary Front [RUF] rebels in the Pujehun Region 
(210 km southeast of Freetown), according to reports by local 
journalists contacted by telephone from Freetown. 
  The reports stated that the rebels attacked the village of 
Bandasuma shortly before dawn, killing 38 persons before they 
were repelled by government soldiers, who killed 18 of the 
assailants and took eight prisoner after nearly two hours of 
fighting. 
  At the end of January, Sierra Leonean authorities declared 
"total war" against RUF rebels, who have been fighting in 
eastern Sierra Leone for the past two years.

  [Text] The results of the first round of the legislative 
elections, which were held on 6 February, were announced by the 
Togolese Supreme Court this morning. During an ordinary session 
held at the courtroom of the Lome Court of Justice, the Supreme 
Court confirmed the results released by the National Electoral 
Commission [CEN] to the public. It agreed that the poll was 
held in a peaceful, safe, and honest atmosphere. The Supreme 
Court also agreed that 57 of the 352 contesting candidates 
obtained an absolute majority of votes and proclaimed them 
elected. It however observed that 48 other candidates, who did 
not obtain enough votes during the first round of the election, 
must contest the second round. The decree issued today approved 
all the results released by the CEN. The Supreme Court, which 
rejected petitions for cancellations, established that the 
turnout rate was about 65 to 70 percent and estimated that 
invalid votes were 37,407.

  [Text] The government has confirmed that a special session 
of Parliament will be convened within two weeks two bring about 
far reaching amendments to the interim and the electoral 
constitutions. The announcement flows from proposals made by the 
government and the ANC [African National Congress] which could 
pave the way for an all inclusive settlement. 
  [Begin Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer 
recording] Even if we fail to get the constitution as far as 
convincing the Freedom Alliance parties to also accept the 
proposals, we nevertheless still have to go ahead and push it 
through Parliament, to amend the constitution and also to adapt 
the electoral constitution so as to create the possibility for 
further registration by other parties. [end recording] 
  The proposals make for, among others, provision for a double 
ballot, the entrenchment of the volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] 
idea in the final constitution, extended powers to provinces, 
the retention of the name kwaZulu/Natal, and the postponement of 
the registration date for political parties to take part in the 
election. 
  The Freedom Alliance says it is cautiously optimistic about 
the proposals. However, all the parties want to study the 
proposals before reacting to them. 
  KwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi has called it a 
step in the right direction. He also disclosed that President 
F.W. de Klerk told him by telephone that a government delegation 
was to meet King Goodwill Zwelithini soon to eliminate 
obscurities about his constitutional role. Reaction has also 
been received from the Inkatha Freedom Party, the PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] and the Democratic Party [DP]. 
  [Begin recording] [Inkatha's Hennie Bekker] The first 
reaction to that is that there is a possibility of us moving 
forward and we can look if we cannot find each other along the 
way. 
  [PAC's Gora Ebrahim, in English] We of the PAC are certainly 
opposed to the balkanization or the creation of ethnic states. 
But we do recognize the fact that there is a need for an all 
inclusive election in our country, and we hope that this would 
now pave the way for inclusive elections to take place not later 
than the 27th of April 1994. 
  [DP's Douglas Gibson] Regarding the possibility of a 
volkstaat feel a little uncomfortable because three days ago Mr. 
Nelson Mandela announced there would not be a volkstaat in South 
Africa. His statement now seems to hint that there could be a 
volkstaat, and on television last night, Dr. Pallo Jordan said 
that the ANC has not changed its approach at all, so I'm not 
sure whether they are not just playing with words. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Statement by ANC President Nelson Mandela, issued by the </F>
African National Congress on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 16 
February] 
  [Text] South Africa is today at the crossroads. The way 
forward requires vision and balanced leadership which transcends 
narrow political interests. 
  Great progress has been made towards the first democratic 
elections on 27 April 1994. Already, parties which have 
committed themselves to agreements arising out of multi-party 
negotiations are out in the hustings competing for votes in what 
has become the most exciting political mobilisation that our 
country has ever seen. Such is true democracy. 
  Yet there are others, steeped in the politics of the past -- 
the politics of racism, ethnic chauvinism and violence -- who 
seek to drown the process in blood. This shall not and cannot be 
allowed to continue. 
  It is necessary that all South Africans unite in a common 
endeavour to deal with this danger. We cannot allow the birth of 
our society as a united, non-racial and democratic nation to be 
held to ransom by captivities of the apartheid past. 
  Now is the time for all our people -- black and white, 
whatever our language or ethnic origins -- to speak with one 
voice. The product of the negotiations process must reach its 
culmination with the election on 27 April of a new democratic 
government based on the will of all the people. 
  In this regard, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the 
ANC [African National Congress] has reviewed the current 
situation and reaffirmed the following National Executive 
Committee decisions: 
  Firstly, that the elections on 27 April, 1994 cannot under 
any circumstances be postponed. 
  Secondly, that the integrity and sovereignty of South 
Africa, 
as defined in the interim constitution, cannot be tampered with. 
  And thirdly, that measures need to be taken to address the 
fears of those who feel left out of the process, either as a 
result of misconceptions about what it entails or deliberate 
misinformation by those not interested in a genuine resolution 
of our problems. 
  In order to address these issues, the NWC reaffirmed 
decisions of the National Executive Committee with regard to the 
following matters which have recently been under negotiations: 
  1. Inclusion in the interim constitution of a constitutional 
principle on self-determination, based on the negotiations 
conducted with the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] and others; as 
well as provisions for a mechanism and process for the 
consideration of the issue of a volkstaat [homeland]. 
  2. Provision for voters to cast 2 votes: one each for 
national and provincial representatives. 
  3. Amendment to the interim constitution to address the 
following provincial matters 
  3.1. A constitutional provision for provincial 
finances based on agreements reached in negotiations with the 
Freedom Alliance; 
3.2. A constitutional provision allowing provinces, in 
drafting provincial constitutions, to determine their own 
legislative and executive structures; 
3.3. In order to grant greater security to the 
newly-elected democratic provincial governments, amend 
provisions of the interim constitution to ensure that powers 
presently granted are not substantially diminished when the 
constitutional assembly drafts the new constitution; and 
3.4. That the democratically-elected provincial 
legislatures will decide on names for their provinces, and that, 
in the interim constitution, the province of natal can be 
renamed kwaZulu/Natal. 

    Pursuant to these decisions, the ANC will recommend to other 
parties and the Transitional Executive Council that, in a matter 
of days: 

  -  the multi-party forum should convene to discuss these 
proposed amendments; 
  -  if the multi-party forum so decides, Parliament should 
convene 
to adopt amendments agreed upon; and the date for registration 
of parties should be extended by a few days. 

    We wish to reiterate that these measures should only be 
implemented if they do not result in the postponement of the 27 
April elections. 
  The ANC reaffirms its readiness to confer with His Majesty 
King Zwelethini on issues of concern to the monarch and other 
traditional leaders. 
  We are firmly of the view that these proposals remove all 
the 
remaining obstacles for the parties which have not yet done so, 
to register and become part of the process. We do however 
recognise their right not to take part in the democratic 
elections. But no one has the right to disrupt the elections. No 
one should be allowed to do so. 
  We wish to issue a solemn reminder to those who think that 
they can use force to disrupt the democratic process that the 
people of this country have both the capacity and the will to 
use their power to defeat these attempts. We call on our people 
to exercise maximum vigilance and ready themselves for any such 
attempts. 
  History and future generations would judge the current South 
African leadership harshly if we failed to take all the 
necessary measures to resolve South Africa's problems peacefully 
and through dialogue.

<F P=106> [Statement by State President F.W. de Klerk on the SAPA PR </F>
wire service on 16 February] 
  [Text] The government and the National Party [NP] have, 
over the past weeks, done everything in their power to make an 
inclusive negotiated settlement possible. Various proposals and 
counter-proposals were tabled in the process. This led to the 
government's negotiating team making a proposal on 2 February 
this year which, in our opinion, could resolve the deadlock. 
  The ANC [African National Congress] has now dropped its 
opposition to important aspects of this proposal and we believe 
that this offers the opportunity to all parties, including the 
Freedom Alliance [FA] parties, to participate in the elections. 
In particular, the proposal addresses two matters which were of 
key importance to the parties of the Freedom Alliance, namely a 
constitutional principle which makes provision for 
self-determination and a related mechanism which gives further 
attention to the idea of a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] and 
a constitutional principle which provides that the powers and 
capabilities of the provinces will in essence be maintained. 
All the other matters are, however, also of crucial importance. 
  The road to peaceful participation in the election is, in 
our 
opinion, now open to all parties and the government expresses 
its hope that the Freedom Alliance will now place the interests 
of South Africa and of its own voters first.

<F P=106> [Report by J. Saunders] </F>
  [Text] Port Elizabeth Feb 16 SAPA -- All obstacles in the 
way of an inclusive democratic settlement have been removed by 
the concessions the African National Congress' [ANC] National 
Working Committee took on Wednesday [16 February], 
Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa said. 
  Speaking to Port Elizabeth's business community at a 
function 
on Wednesday night, Mr Ramaphosa briefed about 60 guests on the 
committee decision to provide for greater regional powers and a 
double ballot system to meet the demands of the Freedom 
Alliance. "This is the best offer they can expect to get and we 
expect them to respond positively," he said in answer to a 
question. "If they respond in the negative, then we know all 
they are interested in is disrupting the elections to frustrate 
democracy and to have a civil war. We will not allow any party 
to disrupt our march to democracy, or to disrupt the elections. 
Then strong and hard measures will have to be taken against 
them." 
  But Mr Ramaphosa said he preferred negotiations. "We have 
made this gesture of conciliation today (Wednesday) so that 
there should be no more talk of civil war or violence." 
  Saying the ANC recognised that the Zulu king should have a 
place of honour as monarch in the province of Natal, Mr 
Ramaphosa added: "The ANC is doing this to show it is not 
irresponsible on the future of South Africa...To show we want an 
all-inclusive settlement. We have built a house of democracy. 
We expect them to come and live with us in this house now that 
we have made these alterations." 
  Commenting on the Eastern Cape, Mr Ramaphosa said this was 
the forgotten part of the country. "It's like the government 
just closed its eyes to the Eastern Cape and walked away. We 
must address unemployment throughout the country, but I would 
say especially here in the Eastern Cape." 
  Mr Ramaphosa said the ANC had been in touch with the 
government on Wednesday to inform them of the committee's 
decision and they would hold a bilateral meeting in Pretoria on 
Thursday to discuss it further. 
  The multiparty conference would reconvene either on Monday 
or 
Tuesday. "We will try to persuade all other parties that this 
is the right decision so that we can have peace in our country. 
We then expect parliament to meet in the course of next week," 
said Mr Ramaphosa. 
  After that the registration date for parties would be 
extended for parties which had not yet registered.

SAPA PR wire service on 16 February] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Mr Mandela's Press Statement About Amendments to 
the Constitution </H3>
  I take the greatest exception to the content and tone of the 
opening paragraphs of the press statement that Mr Mandela issued 
prior to his departure for the Netherlands. The ordinary reader 
of these paragraphs would justifiably infer from what he said in 
them that anybody opposing the constitution and the election 
under it are `steeped in the politics of the past -- the 
politics of racism, ethnic chauvinism and violence'. 
  I oppose the 1993 constitution because it is fatally flawed 
as a democratic constitution and any election under it must be 
rejected as undemocratic. We reject the constitution on 
universally accepted constitutional principles. 
  No constitution which dictates that it be replaced by 
another 
constitution drawn up and piloted through a new constitution 
making process by a ruling political party, would be accepted by 
any democratic people in the world. Constitutions should be all 
about limiting the power of the state and maximising the power 
of the people. Dogs do not muzzle themselves and ruling parties 
do not write constitutions which are designed to ensure frequent 
changes of government through the electoral process. 
  Every democratic constitution relies on special majorities 
before constitutions can be amended. Instead of this 
universally accepted norm the 1993 constitution has in it 
deadlock-breaking mechanisms which dictate that the only 
constitution that will be put to a panel of experts and before 
the electorate in a referendum could, and probably will, be 
adopted by a 50.1 per cent majority -- the majority of a ruling 
party. These are some of the fatal flaws in the constitution 
which have nothing to do with racism. 
  As far as the rest of the document is concerned I comment as 
follows: 

  -  Until we have a wording of the constitutional principle 
which is different to the principle agreed to by the ANC but 
rejected by the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] and the Freedom 
Alliance, there is no way forward on this issue. 
  -  Mr Mandela refers to provisions for provincial finances which 
were agreed to in negotiations with the Freedom Alliance. No 
such agreement exists. Nor has it ever existed. It was one of 
the issues on which there were repeated deadlocks. 
  -  Mr Mandela refers to a constitutional provision which allows 
provinces to adopt their own legislative and executive 
structures, but fails to tell the world that the new 
constitutional text adopted by a constitutional assembly could 
scrap the best that a region could produce in making these 
determinations. 
  -  Mr Mandela says that in order to grant greater security to 
newly elected democratic provincial governments, amendments 
should be introduced which ensure that they will not suffer a 
lessening of the powers granted to them under the 1993 
constitution. 

    What earthly use is it to be guaranteed less than the powers 
you have, when what is proposed you have is ridiculously 
inadequate. 
  All Mr Mandela is doing is placing before the public 
constitutional proposals which led to the deadlock in 
negotiations, and introducing them as breakthrough proposals 
which the ANC is prepared to make. What utter hypocrisy. Mr 
Mandela's statement amounts to no more than cheap politicking on 
life and death issues. 
  Mr Mandela concludes by warning of strong action against 
those who 'use force to disrupt' elections and says that action 
will be taken against them. I and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] and the kwaZulu government will oppose the constitution 
and the proposed election under it and we will do so with every 
available democratic means at our disposal. That is our 
democratic right and we will do so.

  [Text] Durban Feb 17 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini 
would not be prevented from promulgating a constitution for his 
kingdom, despite it being an unprecedented act, a kwaZulu 
government spokesman said on Thursday [17 February]. "It is 
unfortunate that we have been so subdued by apartheid that we 
think we can do nothing that has not been done before. This is 
slave mentality," said a statement from kwaZulu Deputy Minister 
of Works Velaphi Ndolvu. "That no other king in the world has 
promulgated the constitution of his kingdom, if this is true, 
will not prevent the king of the Zulus from promulgating the 
constitution," he said. 
  The monarch said on Monday he was preparing to promulgate a 
constitution for a sovereign kwaZulu and Natal kingdom, but 
declined to elaborate at a later media briefing. 
  Mr Ndlovu's remarks were in response to various African 
National Congress statements on the king's demands. On 
allegations the king was an IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
mouthpiece, Mr Ndlovu said these were was based on the fact that 
kwaZulu Chief Minister and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
regularly accompanied the monarch at public functions. "The 
people of South Africa must accept once and for all that Dr M B 
Buthelezi is the traditional prime minister to the king and when 
he appears with the king he does so as both prime minister and 
chief minister and not as president of the IFP." 
  Mr Ndlovu further rejected charges that the king had 
intervened in South Africa's constitutional impasse on behalf of 
the Freedom Alliance. He said King Zwelithini had made a demand 
for the return of his land and the recognition of the "kwaZulu 
kingdom" as a sovereign state as far back as in July last year, 
at his imbizo (traditional gathering) at the FNB Stadium outside 
Johannesburg. The king's demand for the "reinstatement of the 
kwaZulu kingdom emanated form the king himself and not from the 
Freedom Alliance". 
  To allege the king was being used by the IFP was an insult, 
said Mr Ndlovu. "It is the IFP which has supported his majesty 
and not the other way around." 
  The king was genuinely concerned about all Zulus, no matter 
what their political affiliation, and had never expressed 
himself in favour of the IFP with regard to violence, Mr Ndlovu 
added.

  [Text] Pan-Africanist Congress, PAC, Central Committee 
member Patricia de Lille says the white exodus from South Africa 
would be a good thing. Addressing a meeting of the 
International Press Institute in Cape Town, Ms. de Lille said 
the media had blown out of all proportion the white brain drain 
as if the whole country would come to a standstill as a result. 
Her statement is in contrast to African National Congress 
leader Mr. Nelson Mandela's call to whites not to leave the 
country.

<F P=106> [Report by E. Kemp and F. Piennar] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town Feb 16 SAPA -- Pan-Africanist Congress 
[PAC] chief negotiator Patricia de Lille on Wednesday [16 
February] clarified her pronouncement that whites who wished to 
emigrate should be encouraged to do so, but elicited sharp 
criticism from the African National Congress [ANC] and the 
National Party [NP] for her stance. 
  In an interview, Mrs de Lille said her comments to the 
International Press Institute [IPI] conference on Tuesday had 
been incorrectly interpreted in some reports and she had 
received abusive and threatening telephone calls. Mrs de Lille 
told about 500 editors and publishers attending the three-day 
conference that the media had "blown out of proportion" the 
emigration of skilled whites and had created the impression the 
white brain drain would bring the country to a standstill. 
  "The media should rather encourage them to leave to create 
space for the majority who have been suppressed for centuries," 
she said. 
  On Wednesday she said racist white professionals who were 
called on to implement a new government's policies would 
undermine and subvert those policies. "If they are unhappy to 
live under a black government they could be very destructive. 
Such whites should not be forced to remain, but should rather be 
encouraged to leave." 
  Mrs de Lille said many white professionals who were now 
emigrating had been educated at taxpayers' expense. "The 
question must now be asked whether the people who are leaving 
have repaid that money." 
  She said, however, the PAC's use of the term African did not 
exclude whites "because we believe in only one race -- the human 
race". Whites who accepted the democratic rule of a black 
majority and identified with Africa were also regarded as 
Africans by the PAC. 
  But Mrs de Lille's statement at the conference drew sharp 
responses from the ANC and the NP. 
  Irresponsible and inflammatory, said the ANC in a statement. 
"Encouraging mass exodus of whites ahead of the formation of a 
government of national unity contradicts the whole purpose of 
the agreement between all parties reached at the multiparty 
constitutional talks...it could only serve to destabilise the 
economy and thus heighten social tensions," the ANC said. 
  NP Informationa and Media Director Marthinus van Schalkwyk 
said Mrs de Lille's statements indicated extreme racism and 
highlighted the PAC's short-sighted approach to future stability 
and economic growth. "The PAC's claim that they are not 
anti-white and that they represent all people who are truly 
bound to Africa is finally discredited by this statement. 
  "A person such as Prof Deon Basson who appears high on the 
PAC's candidate list will surely, after this statement, no 
longer feel at home in an organisation which so clearly stands 
for black racism," Mr van Schalkwyk said in a statement.

<F P=106> [By Gideon van Oudtshoorn] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 16 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] would "democratise" mineral rights but would not 
do so unilaterally, ANC reconstruction and development programme 
convenor Jay Naidoo said on Wednesday. [16 February] 
  He was addressing about 300 Witwatersrand brokers at a 
breakfast presentation at the Transvaal Automobile Club in 
Johannesburg linked by telephone throughout the country and 
broadcast live by M-Net. 
  Introduced by veteran politician Helen Suzman, Mr Naidoo 
said 
in most developed countries like Britain, Australia and Canada 
minerals belonged to the people and were used to benefit their 
societies. 
  However, in South Africa mineral rights -- "like the rest of 
the economy" -- were concentrated in the hands of a few 
conglomerates and had not been used to benefit the people. The 
current system of mineral rights also prevented the optimal 
development of mining and use of urban land. "We are seeking to 
return mineral rights to the hands of the democratic government, 
in line with the rest of the world. However, I must stress that 
this, along with our policy proposals, will not be implemented 
unilaterally. We will consult and invite all stakeholders in 
the process of restructuring," Mr Naidoo said. 
  He said the ANC's principle objective was to transform 
mining 
and the processing of minerals to serve all people. This goal 
could be achieved through a variety of government interventions, 
incentives and disincentives. "The management and marketing of 
our mineral exports must be examined together with employers, 
unions and the government to ensure maximum benefits for our 
country. There are no quick-fix solutions to the problems 
apartheid has created. Till today miners who work underground 
at great risk in the most dangerous conditions are excluded from 
fundamental decisions that affect their work situations. If we 
value the lives and well-being of workers and higher levels of 
efficiency and productivity, we must look at democratising the 
mining sector through involving workers, management and the 
unions in negotiations on the organisation of work." 
  Mr Naidoo said the government should consider ways to 
encourage small-scale mining and enhance opportunities for 
people to participate through financial and technical support 
and aid in access to mineral rights. 
  However, standards of health and safety, the environment and 
working conditions had to be improved. "International supply 
and demand patterns for metals and minerals have undergone 
fundamental changes in recent years that necessitate the 
restructuring of this major industry. In the medium term this 
probably means a continued decline in the number of people 
employed in mines. Up to now, the heaviest burdens associated 
with down-scaling have been borne by miners, one-third of whom 
have been retrenched." 
  Referring to taxation, Mr Naidoo said the present system 
showed "glaring discrepancies" and placed an unfair tax burden 
on women and the middle and lower income groups. "Here we are 
proposing that the democratic government mandates the financial 
and fiscal commission to review the tax structure in order to 
develop a more progressive, fair and transparent tax structure." 
  Priorities should include eliminating tax bias against women 
regardless of marital status, taking into account unpaid labour 
performed by them and child care costs. 
  Personal income tax should be reviewed to reduce the 
financial drag on middle income earners, while company tax 
breaks for health, education, housing and other expenditures 
should be rationalised. 
  VAT [value-added tax] on basic foodstuffs should be 
zero-rated. "The new democratic government will also have to 
tighten up on tax collection and ensure that the current 
situation of billions of rands in tax evasion must not be 
allowed to continue," Mr Naidoo said.

  [Text] AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene 
Terreblanche has made renewed threats of war. He told a public 
meeting in Bloemfontein last night that although the AWB wanted 
peace, if the right wing went to war it would not be for 14 
percent of the country but for the whole country. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Conrad Burke] Addressing a 
crowd of more than 2,000 supporters in the city hall, Mr. 
Terreblanche said he had 60,000 trained soldiers in 
Bloemfontein. He added that 95 percent of the commandos in the 
[Orange] Free State were also right wingers. Mr. Terreblanche 
warned that if there was war, it would be full scale. 
  [Terreblanche in Afrikaans] If you want peace, give the 
Boers 
their state. If you do not give it to us, I tell you, there is 
no force on earth which will hold back the Boer nation from 
taking back its fatherland through violence. 
  [Burke] After all the Afrikaner people had done in the 
development of the country, said Mr. Terreblanche, a patch of 
land to plow seemed little to ask for. The AWB leader added 
that loyal sections of the Defense Force and the police would 
stand behind the Afrikaner people in their fight for freedom. 
  [Terreblanche] I have the biggest assurance, and I want to 
say very positively that the South African Defense Force and the 
South African Police, if commanded by the communist to shoot 
their people, will not do it because they know where their 
loyalty, their God, their church, and their people are. [end 
recording] 
  Mr. Terreblanche told GMSA [Good Morning South Africa] a 
while ago that he was unaware of the government and ANC [African 
National Congress] concessions when he made his speech last 
night. He said that like the other members of the Freedom 
Alliance, the AWB would study these concessions before 
commenting on them.

<F P=106> [Interview with AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche by SABC </F>
announcer Max du Preez on the "Agenda" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Du Preez] In the studio I have with me the leader 
of the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement], Mr. Eugene 
Terreblanche. Good evening, Mr. Terreblanche. I should perhaps 
mention here that we had invited General Constand Viljoen and 
Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg of the Conservative Party. They had 
initially agreed to appear, but later withdrew. Thank you for 
keeping your word, Mr. Terreblanche, and coming to the studio. 
  Mr. Terreblanche, these are dangerous times we are living 
in. 
You know that as well as I do. I would, therefore, like us to 
be very direct tonight, so that people can be informed. My 
first question is: What do the clothes you are wearing mean? 
You always wear them in public these days. Why do you go 
around in a cap trimmed with gold and a camouflage uniform? 
  [Terreblanche] The fact is, this is the official dress of 
the 
AWB's Victory Commando. In the beginning we wore khaki to 
identify ourselves as a movement with a distinct identity. A 
few months ago this became our official dress, especially 
designed for our commandos. I should mention that it is not our 
general wear, but there is no reason why, when one appears on 
the Agenda program, one has to be dressed in a suit. This is 
the way we dress when we hold our staff meetings, when we are in 
camp... 
  [Du Preez] Clothes make a statement. What does your outfit 
say? 
  [Terreblanche] If these clothes could speak, they would say 
there are men in South Africa, the overwhelming majority of the 
Afrikanerdom, who are preparing for war, a war which is being 
forced upon us. We do not want to find ourselves in the 
position of the whites in the rest of Africa, the white 
colonialists who were caught... 
  [Du Preez] But as recently as January when you were 
negotiating you appeared in those clothes at the negotiations. 
  [Terreblanche] I have never negotiated. I have held 
discussions with members of the government. 
  [Du Preez] But you must have been hoping there would be 
peace, a settlement... 
  [Terreblanche, interrupting] Yes, of course. But I never 
negotiated with the enemy, the African National Congress [ANC] 
and the South African Communist Party [SACP]... 
  [Du Preez] But was General Viljoen not negotiating on your 
behalf? 
  [Terreblanche] No, not at all. 
  [Du Preez] But are you not a member of the Afrikaner 
National 
Front [AVF]? 
  [Terreblanche] I am a member of the AVF, but the AWB has 
always reserved the right not to be part of the negotiations. 
You must understand that there are naturally small, very small 
differences within the AVF, because the AVF is made up of 19 
different organizations... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] Are the differences really so very 
small, or are they growing? 
  [Terreblanche] If you would allow me to continue, I will 
show 
you how small these differences are. The most important thing 
is that the issue which brought us together remains the first, 
the primary task of the AVF, and that is the achievement of a 
homeland for the Afrikaner Boer nation. Some believe that this 
can be achieved through negotiations. I am convinced that 
negotiations with a communist can never bring peace, because 
communists all over the world, in all their negotiations, have 
always showed they cannot honor their word. 
  [Du Preez] Did you tell that to Gen. Viljoen? Did you say to 
him, look, General, you are going to negotiate on my behalf, and 
on my party's behalf, and I am part of your movement, but you 
are negotiating with communists, and therefore you are not 
negotiating on my behalf? [as heard] 
  [Terreblanche] Gen. Viljoen is very much aware that the AWB 
does not believe in negotiations. That has been the case since 
we met, and that is how we became part of the National Front. 
  [Du Preez] And also of the Freedom Alliance? 
  [Terreblanche] The fact is I have not negotiated with the 
Freedom Alliance either, because it is not at all necessary. 
The task of the AWB is different, a task we have set for 
ourselves, years ago, 20 years ago, when we said that at some 
time or another this government will capitulate, as the white 
colonial regimes capitulated in Africa. We said we must 
establish a people's movement whose primary task would be to see 
to it that law and order is maintained when chaos and disorder 
breaks out. 
  [Du Preez] What you are saying is that whenever Gen. Viljoen 
was negotiating, or holding discussions, or whatever term one 
uses -- on behalf of the AWB as a member of the AVF -- you had 
no faith in all that; you are saying that there are communists 
in the ANC, and you do not negotiate with communists. There 
were negotiations with Inkatha and the Bophuthatswana government 
and Ciskei and the Freedom Alliance, and even then you as the 
AWB had no faith in the talks. Is that so? 
  [Terreblanche] I find it very strange that you could make 
such a statement. 
  [Du Preez] Have I misunderstood you? 
  [Terreblanche] No, I think you understand me quite clearly; 
and I believe I also understand you well. I want to point out, 
however, that I was the first leader of an organization which 
negotiated with nonwhite leaders outside parliamentary 
structures -- or rather, I talked with them. I, as leader of 
the AWB, invited Captain Diergaardt [member of the Democratic 
Turnhalle Alliance of Namibia] to South Africa long before the 
fall of South-West Africa. I signed an agreement with Mr. Musa 
Myeni of Inkatha in the Transvaal. I also signed an agreement 
in Vereeniging with Inkatha's Mr. Thwala. I signed an agreement 
with Ciskei. As for the present negotiations, I have no part in 
them, because Gen. Viljoen and Dr. Hartzenberg have taken it 
upon themselves to shoulder that part of the attainment of a 
homeland. 
  [Du Preez] And do you have confidence in them? Even today? 
  [Terreblanche] I do. Of course, I do. 
  [Du Preez] When your people booed Gen. Viljoen on 29 
January, 
why did no one stand up for him? There he was, standing alone, 
and the people who were booing him were mainly AWB members. 
  [Terreblanche] It is clear you were not present. I was the 
person who immediately went to his assistance. I walked to the 
platform and said, the people do not understand this point, and 
I then proposed that the issue be referred back to the national 
assembly. I made the announcement, and the situation was 
defused. 
  [Du Preez] Good, but now we come to an interesting point. 
You say that you told the people they do not understand the 
point, but this was a very important point that General Viljoen 
tried to make. In reality, as I understand the situation, it is 
the closest the National Front has ever come to a settlement. 
In my book, as I read it from a neutral corner, this was such a 
good dispensation for the National Front. Can you tell me what 
your understanding is of that proposal offered by General 
Viljoen when he was heckled, because that was actually a turning 
point? 
  [Terreblanche] On that Thursday, the Thursday preceding the 
Saturday of the meeting, Dr. Hartzenberg informed me of the 
situation for the first time and we had the documentation at 
hand. The same night I put forward the official stance of the 
AWB to Dr. Hartzenberg, and that is that the requirements of the 
Afrikaner National Front and my organization, the AWB, are not 
being met. I shot down that document with the greatest 
determination. 
  [Du Preez] What did that document say, Mr. Terreblanche? 
  [Terreblanche] That document merely said that the Afrikaner 
Boer nation has a right to propagate the ideal of a homeland 
after the 27 April election. 
  [Du Preez] As I understand it, and I stand corrected, this 
document stated that the Afrikaner National Front should 
participate in the nonracial election and then all the electoral 
wards, or districts rather, will be counted separately and 
announced. People voting for the National Front will then vote 
for a manifesto which says: We want a homeland. As I 
understand the document and its contents said that they will 
then look at where these people are who want a homeland and how 
many there are, and then a clause will be added to the 
transitional constitution which says that when there is 
sufficient proof of support for a homeland, then it can be 
negotiated nine months thereafter, after a new government is in 
place. Is my understanding of this incorrect? 
  [Terreblanche] Yes. You see, the basic issue is that the 
African National Congress or the government did not recognize 
the rights of the people, that it wanted land of its own in its 
own free republic. All that it said -- the modus operandi -- 
all that they said is just that you will have the right to 
pursue the ideal of a homeland. 
  [Du Preez] But it is written into the constitution. 
  [Terreblanche] That does not mean anything. Whether it is 
written into the constitution or not -- it means that the 
constitution is so full of shortcomings -- whether or not it is 
written into the constitution, then in the future we may only be 
able to argue about certain things. To say you have the right 
to ask about these things is pathetic. Recognition was not 
given as a right of our people. When I argue about this I am 
being realistic. The right of people -- the reason for the UN's 
existence, the reason for its existence, is to see that nations 
can live in freedom and sovereignty and that the one does not 
hinder the other's sovereignty -- all that these people are 
saying is that we are offering, in your own fatherland, that you 
will have the right hereafter to propagate this. I just want to 
say, later they added a tail, which said that you will have the 
right to speak your language and that you will have the right to 
practice your religion. If you look at the entire document, it 
says: Under a strange government, in which I am not admitting 
that you have the right to your own land, you will be able to 
cry in Afrikaans and you will be able to pray in Afrikaans -- 
those are the only rights you are given. 
  [Du Preez] Then you said that this is unacceptable? 
  [Terreblanche] Yes. 
  [Du Preez] But that was General Viljoen's proposal. 
  [Terreblanche] Yes. 
  [Du Preez] But earlier you told me that you still trust 
General Viljoen. 
  [Terreblanche] The fact of the matter is...I believe that 
General Viljoen, to the best of his ability, tried to achieve a 
settlement, and indeed also told me and my general staff, that 
he will do everything in his power to try and achieve a 
settlement along these peaceful lines, that he would never be 
able to tear himself away from the ideal or the reality of a 
homeland and the right of the Boer people to self-determination. 
Now General Viljoen has the right to try his own method. As I 
told you.... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] But is that a method you reject? 
  [Terreblanche] It is very definitely something that I will 
not attempt to do, because it does not help if the people you 
are negotiating with are the aggressors who have already 
declared war. 
  [Du Preez] But General Viljoen does not think so. Do you 
think he is naive? 
  [Terreblanche] I do not think that General Viljoen should 
think the way I do or as any other person thinks. 
  [Du Preez] Yes, but you feel strongly about this. 
  [Terreblanche] I do feel strongly about this but I want to 
tell you again that the issues inspiring us to stand together is 
much bigger than the difference in method used -- than 
differences in modus operandi between the two groups. 
  [Du Preez] And if he made that proposal on that day, the 
29th, this proposal contained in the document, which people from 
other camps saw as a big breakthrough -- if he was not heckled, 
if the document was signed, where would you be today, because he 
wanted the document to be accepted. Would you not have accepted 
it? 
  [Terreblanche] I would not have accepted such a settlement. 
If we were forced to the polls with a vague promise that the 
ANC, showing great mercy, would give us a homeland after the 
27th, one that it does not want to give now, then I would 
definitely have distanced myself from the National Front. The 
people have decided and it does not help to say AWB supporters 
shouted him down. That was the voice of the people, and you 
know what Paul Kruger said.... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] And did the people reject Gen. 
Viljoen? 
  [Terreblanche] No. They rejected the proposal. 
  [Du Preez] But he believes so strongly in it. 
  [Terreblanche] I don't think he believes so strongly in it. 
  [Du Preez] There are many people in this country who believe 
that that was the best deal the Afrikaner could have negotiated; 
they feel that Eugene Terreblanche is dragging them into war, 
instead of accepting that deal. They ask, what right does he 
have to declare war on behalf of our descendants? They say, if 
we tested our votes, we could have had a very strong argument 
against the rest of the country, and against the world; we 
could have pointed to our support, to our regions, and to the 
clause in the constitution which says if there is sufficient 
proof of the desire of a group to have self-determination, it 
must be negotiated. 
  [Terreblanche] Let's just look at what you have just said. 
We have been promised nothing. All they said is, you will have 
the right to propagate your homeland. When they said we can 
test our support, they meant a test of support against the 28 
million or 30 million people in this country. They want the 
smaller number of white votes to be counted along with those of 
the black majority. We said we would very much like to show our 
support, either through a referendum or an election held among 
the Afrikaner people, which would be conducted by the state, so 
that we could prove to the state what the will of the Afrikaner 
Boer nation is. The ANC, on the other hand, proposed that they 
count the votes of the 4 million whites together with the rest, 
and then decide whether we may propagate our goal further. 
  [Du Preez] Let's just stop there for a moment. Eugene 
Terreblanche and the AWB are now saying this is not acceptable, 
this is not a good proposal. You say you will make the country 
look like Guy Fawkes, and I quote, the Boers will burn down this 
land. Now you talk about a reasonably serious war. What about 
this: you take part in the elections, you show support for a 
homeland, and then a clause is added onto the constitution 
saying that now you may propagate your goals, and so on. The 
ANC and the communists then laugh at you. Is this not the 
moment you say, now I am in a corner? 
  [Terreblanche] Mr. du Preez, one cannot give recognition to 
an illegitimate election. If you become part of an election, 
then you become part of the outcome of that election. I cannot 
become part of a monster of a system created to evaluate the 
small minority in its own fatherland. The only way of democracy 
is for the people to have true freedom. Democracy does not just 
mean the right of the individual. Democracy means the right of 
a people to live in freedom, and that members of that people 
should not be stopped from exercising its own human right. We 
have been offered just that; no recognition. We as a nation 
are not being recognized in spite of the suffering and grief, 
sacrifice and struggle, to civilize this country. You are now 
being counted as equal. When you've seen how many have voted 
for a homeland, you will feel you have the right to propagate 
that homeland, and to decide if we will get a homeland. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche were you present when the 
Bosnian 
professor addressed the Afrikaner People? 
  [Terreblanche] Yes I was. 
  [Du Preez] Can you remember what she said about her 
experience in Bosnia-Hercegovina: Better a thousand days of 
negotiations rather than the first bullet? 
  [Terreblanche] Yes. 
  [Du Preez] The violence, are you not being too hasty? Do you 
not realize the seriousness of a war with which you are 
threatening? 
  [Terreblanche] Mr. du Preez, let us leave the issue of 
violence, and my opinion of violence for later. I opposed that 
lady. I said to her it is precisely because of your 
negotiations, precisely as a result of the methods used by the 
enemy, that you now have a modern Stalin situation. The 
original Stalin did to Eastern Europe exactly what Nelson 
Mandela and De Klerk are attempting to do now, namely to combine 
small groups of people in a unitary state in order to create a 
type of a new Russian Republic, a democratic republic, which 
failed after 40 years, after the tears, grief, and death of 
millions of people. Now Joseph Stalin's recipe is being used in 
a unitary state, and under a communist authority. We know that 
almost 75 percent of the national executive committee of the ANC 
are communists. 
  [Du Preez] You are saying the Boers will burn down the land. 
I do not want to be judgmental Mr. Terreblanche, but my 
impression as an Afrikaans-speaking South African is that you, 
your party, and other members of the National Front are 
romanticizing violence. And I do wonder if the difference 
between Eugene Terreblanche and Constand Viljoen is not that 
Constand Viljoen knows the meaning of a war. He placed our sons 
in body bags in Angola and Namibia. Are you familiar with that 
side of a war, and where will that war which you are planning 
begin? 
  [Terreblanche] I am not here to write a resume about 
myself. But I want to say to you that at one stage, for a year 
and 14 days, I was on the borders of my country, and then again 
for six months. I know the bush, I volunteered, and I am the 
son of a militarist, and have never, when my country was in 
danger, taken cover behind negotiations or nice talk. And with 
due respect, you are deliberately trying to drive a wedge 
tonight between Gen. Viljoen and myself. Gen. Viljoen and I.... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] I want to get answers tonight for 
the viewers and the electorate? 
  [Terreblanche] I do not believe that there is one single 
viewer or voter who for one moment thinks that I am 
romanticizing a bloody war. I also have walked along the 
pathway of the dangers of terrorism in the banks and deep gorges 
of Rhodesia for months and months, and today these same 
terrorists want to sit around the table with vague promises of a 
homeland. It is unbelievable, that a people believing in a 
living God should be granted vague promises from Satan himself 
and his peons, and his communists, this is what worries the 
people. Not the fact that I say I am prepared to defend my 
country with my life. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche, we have about 30 seconds left. 
Tell me one thing, against whom is the war, and who gets the 
first bullet. The day you declare war, who gets shot first? 
  [Terreblanche] The aggressor. I categorically state: We are 
standing on the verge of a revolution which will not be caused 
by the rightists of South Africa, but the chaos which will 
follow because of this government, the ANC, the elections.... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] Who in the elections? 
  [Terreblanche] It does not matter, white or black, or 
technicolor, if he takes away the right of the Boer people to 
govern himself in his God-given country.... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] So it could be Mr. de Klerk? 
  [Terreblanche] Sir, let us not.... 
  [Du Preez] Could it be an Inkatha supporter, or the 
Alliance? 
  [Terreblanche] No it cannot be an official of Inkatha, 
because Inkatha is not participating in the elections, and 
kwaZulu feels the same way I feel about my fatherland. 
  [Du Preez] What about the current racial conflict underway? 
  [Terreblanche] For heavens sake it is not about race. It is 
the rights of a people, and in this case, the rights of the 
Boers, the Zulus and the Tswanas, which has been signed away at 
the table of communists. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche, our time is up. Thank you very 
much.

  [Text] Professor Willem Kleynhans, the reputed political 
commentator and election expert, warns in this report that no 
nation or party in South Africa can at this juncture be ready 
for an election for a unitary government. He warns that 
disaster awaits South Africa if the wretched election is not 
called off. 
  The so-called "mother of all elections in South Africa," 
which, due to an overwhelmingly euphoric reason, has to take 
place in an attempt to come out of apartheid, will destroy South 
Africa if it is not called off, Kleynhans said. 
  All indications are that less than 50 percent of the alleged 
22 million voters will vote in this election. 
  The NP [National Party], IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], ANC 
[African National Congress], and the SACP [South African 
Communist Party] are, according to their own admissions, 
generally unprepared for the election. 
  The Conservative Party is on record as saying that it will 
not take part in the damned election, while the patriotic sector 
of the Afrikaner/Boer nation unanimously rejected on 29 January 
any participation in the election. 
  The Zulus and the Tswanas are determined they are not going 
to vote. 
  The parties keen on participation have already proved that 
they could never -- within three months -- be able to educate 
the 9 million illiterate voters and the 17 million voters who 
have never voted before. Besides, they will not even be able to 
reach all the new voters. 
<H5>  Victimization </H5>
  De Klerk said his target is at least 3 million black voters. 
To date he cannot in any way rely on any black voters, because 
as soon as the communists come forward with full scale 
victimization -- as has in the past been done without exception 
in every African country -- de Klerk will probably not even get 
a single black vote. 
  The ANC has held several mass meetings, but has as yet not 
reached the millions of rural blacks through those meetings. 
  The overwhelming majority of potential black voters still 
have to be "taught" to go to the polling booths. 
  At this stage, rural blacks have no election machinery that 
encourages and organizes them to vote. 
  The mother of all elections must take place because of a 
euphoric consideration to leave apartheid behind, but without 
the very important prior education of the illiterate portion -- 
namely, 9 million members -- of the voters' corps. 
  The chances are already 100 percent that the percentage of 
people voting will be very low, and this will affect the 
credibility aspect of the election. 
  I anticipate the result to be so bad that it will shock the 
entire world. 
  At the same time the black voters will be so shocked by the 
election results that they will most probably veer away 
permanently from the elected government and rather resort -- 
like elsewhere in Africa -- to anarchy to achieve their 
objectives. 
<H5>  Voter Education Fails </H5>
  All so-called "voter education" [preceding two words in 
English] programs have so far been entirely unsuccessful in 
improving the political knowledge of the nine million 
illiterates. 
  In any case, this education does not bring over a single 
convincing message to the millions of blacks which will satisfy 
what they are striving for. 
<H5>  Call Off Election </H5>
  De Klerk's only logical step, which he can still take in the 
midst of the prevailing anarchy, is to call off the election, 
otherwise CHAOS will be the result of the election and not peace 
as has been promised. 
<H5>  Unprepared </H5>
  The NP is currently further from preparedness than a year 
ago. Wherever de Klerk goes, ANC supporters turn the meetings 
into chaotic gatherings. 
  In his quest to please voters, de Klerk has chased away the 
NP's white supporters or he has made them lose interest. 
  The days when tens of thousands of volunteers helped to 
campaign for the NP are no more. 
  The NP's best chance to recruit blacks is in the rural areas 
where the ANC is not making an impact. 
  De Klerk has invited foreign observers to South Africa to 
show them how he is phasing out apartheid. They must see for 
themselves "how a miracle is being achieved in a general 
election in South Africa." [passage in quotes published in 
English] 
  The outside world has been invited to be spectators of the 
big farce of an election. 
  If the election is not called off, de Klerk will learn the 
hard way how stupid he was to try and force 17 million voters, 
who have no idea what elections are about, into a unitary 
election. 
<H5>  Disaster </H5>
  Of course it will spell disaster for de Klerk and company to 
cancel the election. 
  But it will bring a greater disaster to them if they go 
ahead 
with the election. 
  Because for the blacks, who are supposed to benefit from the 
election, the latter will bring unprecedented misery, Kleynhans 
said.

<F P=106> [From the "Commentary" column] </F>
  [Text] Measured by the literally thousands of letters and 
phone calls from compatriots, by the outcome and mass hysteria 
during the 29 January volk's [Afrikaner people] congress in 
Pretoria and the formation of self-protection units by hundreds 
of thousands of Afrikaners/Boers, one concludes that the 
Afrikaner volk is ready to shoot its way clear to 
self-determination and its own country. 
  The volk now demands its leaders to spell out to it how 
Afrikaner self-determination can be achieved so that the volk 
can tread the chosen path to freedom with typical Afrikaner/Boer 
passion. Our leaders have already openly admitted that it would 
have been better to achieve self-determination peacefully and 
without bloodshed, but added that freedom would be grabbed by 
force if there was no other way out. 
  At ground level is an unprecedented anger spreading among 
patriots as it becomes clearer that the de Klerk government is 
selling them out "constitutionally" -- in the most atrocious way 
imaginable -- to black heathen communists. 
  The de Klerk government, through withholding truths and 
through blatant lies, and through misleading voters in several 
elections and in the referendum, has virtually lied -- 
politically speaking -- the Afrikaner/Boer nation into a 
communist revolution. 
  The awarding of the Philadelphia and the Nobel Prizes makes 
up part of the international conspiracy to dress the two 
political conspirators, de Klerk and Mandela, in a false cloak 
of peace. 
  South Africa is the one place in the free world where there 
is no peace and--in the event of a communist unitary government 
after 27 April without the recognition and the realization of 
the aspirations of self-determination of the Afrikaner/Boer 
nation--peace will not be reached in this country in the next 40 
years. 
  According to de Klerk's alleged opinion polls, the 
Conservative Party [CP] and the Inkatha Freedom Party 
collectively only make up 10 percent of potential voters, which 
will mean that the ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South 
African Communist Party] will, in the eyes of the entire world, 
get 90 percent of the votes, which, in an international context, 
will be a "free and fair election" [preceding four words in 
English]. 
  With this type of propaganda de Klerk is trying to force the 
Afrikaner/Boer nation behind the already crumbling multiracial 
NP [National Party]. He still wants every white in the 
democratic election to honestly lose, with him and the NP, the 
struggle for the retention of an Afrikaner/Boer country. 
  The entire Afrikaner/Boer nation will fall in behind the CP 
leadership once it has spelled out the way to Afrikaner/Boer 
self-determination. But if the CP leaders hesitate to spell out 
the way and the method, the man in the street will -- and they 
are already busy doing it -- act without the leaders. 
  PATRIOT believes that the right decision will be made at the 
right time, and we hope that those who write the constitution 
will have good judgment so that they will include in the 
constitution an Afrikaner/Boer volkstaat [homeland], a Zulu 
state, and a Tswana state as a God-given right and a reality. 
It will be an easy recipe for a peaceful settlement and will 
help to avert a looming civil war.

  [Text] The mission from the American defense headquarters, 
the Pentagon, currently on a weeklong visit to ANC [African 
National Congress] leaders, is supposedly in the country to 
promote new military links. In reality its purpose is to bribe 
ANC leaders so that it can scale down the South African weapons 
industry, with a view to eventually closing it down as soon as 
the ANC comes into power. This will be done despite the threat 
of large-scale unemployment and the security risk coupled to 
such a move. The Pentagon has already sent similar missions to 
South American countries, where accusations were immediately 
leveled against the Pentagon, that it tries to bribe state 
leaders in more or less subtle ways to give preference to 
American interests. 
  The eight-man delegation to South Africa consists of the 
U.S. 
Assistant Defense Secretary Charles Freeman, his deputy Jim 
Woods, representatives of the American chiefs of staff and from 
the American "European commandment" which also covers South 
Africa, as well as a representative of American military 
intelligence. The Pentagon explains that the aim of this 
mission is to assist the ANC leaders to apply the integration 
policy in the army, to restructure the various army divisions, 
and in general to encourage "intellectual discussion" between 
ANC leaders and American officials. The background to this is 
that the American Congress has made drastic cuts to the military 
budget, which also affects military assistance. 
  President Clinton is apparently following a policy 
supporting 
democracy worldwide, not only verbally but also financially. 
This policy is aimed at opening the way to promoting American 
exports. South Africa and its military and political leaders can 
expect certain "advantages" from Americans if they help the 
American weapons industry to get contracts in South Africa. The 
U.S. weapons industry apparently sees great possibilities in 
post-apartheid South Africa, according to Freeman. 
  He especially referred to American area detection 
technology, 
a field in which South African industrial research has made 
significant progress. The Pentagon wants this research to be 
discontinued so that information agents in the American Embassy 
in Pretoria can determine, over the same network, exactly where 
South African naval vessels and air force aircraft are 
operating. Observers warn that the objective of spying is never 
far from the thoughts of any member of any American mission 
visiting South Africa. What is new is Clinton's plan to make 
South Africa pay for this by scaling down its weapons industry.

  [Text] Cape Town Feb 16 SAPA -- An internal Eskom 
[Electricity Supply Commission] report has criticised 
maintenance staff at the Koeberg Nuclear Power station for lack 
of attention to detail in their work, and said they felt they 
were under too much production pressure at times. A copy of the 
report was obtained by SAPA during a conference on nuclear 
policy at the weekend, where several speakers expressed concern 
over "human error" as a factor in the safety of nuclear power 
stations -- and some called for the immediate closure of Koeberg. 
  However, Koeberg's station manager, Peter Prozesky, has 
stressed that incidents referred to in the internal report at no 
time presented any nuclear danger. 
  And John Henderson, Koeberg's generation nuclear manager, 
commented that while he supported the need for the public to be 
informed about the operational performance of Koeberg, he felt 
it was misleading that judgments should be formed on isolated 
internal incident reports. These were honest attempts to be 
extremely critical of all incidents, no matter how trivial, and 
to learn from experience. 
  Explaining the circumstances of the report given to SAPA, Mr 
Prozesky said Eskom was trying to cut down the length of its 
"outage" time -- deactivation of a reactor for routine 
maintenance and refuelling. But, he said, it also recognised 
that the human being was the "weak link in the chain", and 
compensated for this with stringent quality checks. 
  The report dealt with an incident towards the end of last 
year, when one of the two units at Koeberg was being 
recommissioned after an outage. A maintenance technician failed 
to replace computer cards that would allow "make-up" pumps to 
activate automatically when water in a steam generator loop 
dropped below a certain level. 
  This was missed in a check before the unit was 
recommissioned, and was only discovered more than a month later. 
  An internal investigation into the incident found that staff 
felt they were under too much pressure during outages. It 
concluded that there was poor control of recommissioning of the 
plant, and a lack of attention to detail. "Yielding to pressure 
of work is also felt to be a contributory factor." 
  Mr Prozesky confirmed another incident during an outage at 
Koeberg last year, when a misunderstanding between staff 
resulted in a valve between the reactor building and the spent 
fuel storage building not closing fully. Some of the 
boron-enriched water that covered and shielded the spent fuel 
drained away. 
  "But I want to stress that in neither incident and at no 
time 
was there any nuclear danger or nuclear risk," he told SAPA. In 
the valve incident, the design of the spent fuel pool made it 
physically impossible for it to drain to the point where the 
fuel was endangered. 
  The response of operators, who noticed the drop in the water 
level, had been swift and according to plan. The water had been 
topped up, and the valve problem diagnosed. The radiation 
monitors in the area had not even been activated. 
  Asked what would have happened had the spent fuel been 
completely exposed, Mr Prozesky said that was "just not 
possible" and "not worth speculating about". "In terms of its 
implications for us, it was a minor incident." 
  In the other incident, either of two backup systems would 
have replenished the water in the generator loop. Had the loop 
not been replenished -- which he also said was not worth 
speculation -- it would merely have boiled dry, with no other 
consequences. 
  Mr Prozesky said there was no doubt that staff were under 
increased workload during outage, an intensive period in which 
more than 6,000 tasks had to be performed. Koeberg had extremely 
long outage periods -- 120 days had been the norm up to now -- 
and was trying to bring them closer to the 35 days targeted by 
the station's sister plants in France. 
  There were very good economic reasons for doing so, as every 
day of outage represented electricity un-generated and unsold. 
Speakers at the conference at the weekend had criticised the 
relatively high cost of Koeberg's electricity and one way to 
bring this down was to operate more efficiently. 
  Mr Prozesky said the human being was the "weak link in the 
chain", and during outages there were always things that would 
go wrong. 
  "What it important is that one recognises that the human 
being is fallible and you put in place appropriate quality 
control mechanisms, and that you have a very sound 
recommissioning programme at the end of outages to pick up 
problems." 
  Commenting on claims that some Koeberg workers felt they 
were 
not fully informed about incidents such as these, Mr Prozesky 
said the valve problem had been fully described in an internal 
staff newsletter. This and other feedback mechanisms had been 
set up specifically to keep staff at all levels fully informed. 
  Discussions were under way to include union representatives 
in all aspects of Koeberg business, including the committees 
that investigated incidents. 
  Mr Henderson commented: "I support the need for the public 
to 
be informed about the operational performance of Koeberg, but I 
feel it is totally wrong and misleading that judgments should be 
formed on isolated internal incident reports. 
  "These reports represent an open and honest attempt to be 
extremely critical of all incidents that occur, no matter how 
trivial. The aim is to learn from our experience. This 
experience is shared with other nuclear plants so that we can 
all learn from each other. 
  "Public judgment should be formed on a more holistic view. 
To 
that end we would welcome public and press interest and an 
opportunity to explain our nuclear safety assurance programme 
and put isolated incidents in perspective. 
  "We are currently, along with the Council for Nuclear 
Safety, 
looking at a communication mechanism which has been adopted by 
the international community to address this specific problem. 
This system is known as ines (international nuclear event 
scale). We would be happy to discuss this system with the press."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Minister Predicts Economic Revival -- Johannesburg THE STAR 
in English on 17 February in a page-14 editorial notes that 
Finance Minister Derek Keys was "very upbeat" and his "message 
to the nation certainly makes encouraging reading, punctuated as 
it is with references to the many factors in place requisite for 
strong economic revival." However, this euphoria should be 
"tempered by an awareness of the platform on which the Minister 
stands. His public pronouncements have one eye on the upcoming 
election and another on the need to reassure foreign investors 
that the ANC's [African National Congress] Leninist leanings are 
designed solely to drum up voter support, and that the danger to 
stability posed by the Freedom Alliance is no more than a 
temporary phenomenon. That such reassurances are needed 
underlines the potential hazards facing the embryonic economic 
recovery." At the same time, Keys's "stress on a positive 
outlook highlights the economy's considerable incipient 
strength, the potential of which (if realised) would serve as a 
major boost to the standard of living of all South Africans." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Revised ANC Position on Constitution `Attractive' -- "The 
revised ANC position on regional powers, self-determination and 
a volkstaat [homeland] may be attractive both to Buthelezi and 
to the more rational elements of the white right," declares a 
page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 17 
February. "It will certainly help show whether they are still 
serious negotiators." "What is needed now is not just hard 
bargaining, but the determination to reach agreement." BUSINESS 
DAY says "constitutional and electoral changes seem certain 
through renewed negotiations and a brief parliamentary session." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Township Facilities `Falling Apart' -- "When the Greater 
Soweto rent boycott ended officially earlier this month 
residents thought the condition of their townships would 
improve," notes Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 17 February 
in a page-8 editorial. But this seems like "a forlorn hope" as 
the trash heaps grow larger and the roads "are all but 
impossible to navigate." "While it is not clear who is in 
charge these days the facilities generally are falling apart." 
"Until residents are convinced their facilities have been 
improved they will not pay." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Difficult Choices on IFP-AVF Actions -- Johannesburg BEELD 
in 
Afrikaans on 14 February points out in a page-8 editorial: "At 
this point it seems fairly certain that the Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] and the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] 
will not participate in the April election. The question is, 
what are the government and the other participating parties 
going to do about this? The harsh reality is that there can be 
no quesiton of postponing or cancelling the election; that would 
cause immeasurably greater problems than those caused by the 
IFP-AVF boycott." "The problem with the boycott is not that 
these parties' supporters will remain outside the election. Ten 
to one they will go and vote. The problem is the ability of 
these two parties to cause disruption and bloodshed. And how 
the authorities should react to it. The government/Transitional 
Executive Council are faced with difficult choices. Should the 
IFP-AVF and the other borderline groups opt for disruption, the 
state does possess the muscle to ward off their efforts and 
defend the process. But it could be a bloody business, which 
may upset the country's brittle psyche. Naturally ruthless 
action by the state to protect the political process would have 
to be the last option. It is, however, a decision which must 
not be reached hesitantly. Exceptional determination will be 
demanded of political role players and others involved. They 
will have to do what must be done, knowing full well that if the 
present problem is not neutralized effectively, far greater 
disaster and misery could be waiting around the corner."

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Laurent Gbagbo, secretary </F>
general of the FPI in Abidjan on 14 February] 
  [Text] [Correspondent Jeanne Agnimel] In his address, the 
FPI [Ivorian Popular Front] secretary general touched on several 
aspects of national life. The FPI, he said, will send 21 
delegations or more to all areas of the country to hold 
discussions with the people. Concerning the holding of 
elections, he sounded a note of warning to the government: He 
said that in the case of fraud, he is not sure that the FPI will 
be able to contain the anger of its members: 
  [Gbagbo] I told my listeners clearly that Houphouet is 
Houphouet, but that after Houphouet, it is no longer Houphouet. 
Since 1990, I have said that Houphouet has cheated, but all the 
same, I sent activists go and tell everyone to remain calm, that 
this was not serious. I am not sure I can keep the people calm 
if it is not Houphouet who is cheating. It is easy to avoid the 
risks--by not cheating. We are ready to help any government 
hold free and fair elections, so that the winner should be 
recognized as the winner and the loser recognized as the loser. 
That is why immediately after our December 1992 convention, we 
established an electoral committee chaired by our comrade, 
Professor Oulai Hubert. This electoral commission completed the 
first part of its work on 13 August 1993 and we presented the 
document to the then prime minister, Alassan Dramane Ouattara. 
We were expecting him to invite us to a meeting with the 
Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire, on one hand, and all the 
parties interested in the elections, on the other, under the 
auspices of the government. 
  After the change of government, we went back to see the new 
prime minister, Daniel Kablan Duncan, and gave him another copy 
of the same document, dated 13 August 1993. As of right now, we 
are still waiting to be invited to hold a serious and important 
session in order to avoid fraud, and hence, trouble. 
  [Agnimel] Concerning devaluation and its effects, the FPI 
secretary general made the following suggestions: 
  [Gbagbo] By increasing the price of fuel, the government has 
run the risk of effecting all the products. On the day of the 
devaluation, I spoke to AFP; I wanted to suggest that the 
government freeze the prices of some commodities, including 
fuel. Then, at the same time, I learned that they had really 
drawn up a list of goods, including fuel, whose prices had been 
frozen. So I did not make any declaration, because fuel is an 
important factor as far as the economy is concerned. Even the 
price of onions will increase if you increase the price of fuel. 
The price of pepper will increase if you increase the price of 
fuel. This is because it is transported from its place of 
production to its place of consumption. When they took the risk 
of increasing the price of fuel, it is evident that the price of 
everything else must increase. Of course, it is not surprising 
to see the trade unions meeting here and there to prepare their 
fight. I would like to state very clearly that we are not 
keeping our flag in our pocket. We will give our active and 
unflinching support to all workers who fight to reconquer their 
lost purchasing power.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 16 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] has given the go-ahead for a special sitting of 
Parliament to amend the constitution to provide for greater 
regional powers and a constitutional principle that could be the 
first step to an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland]. Annoucing 
sweeping concessions at Jan Smuts Airport near Johannesburg 
before embarking on a trip to Holland, ANC President Nelson 
Mandela said the ANC would call for a meeting of the multiparty 
forum leading to a special parliamentary sitting within days. 
  Mr Mandela announced the ANC had also agreed to a 
double-ballot, virtual entrenchment of regional constitutions 
and greater regional taxation powers. 
  He said the ANC had accepted the Natal Province could be 
renamed kwaZulu/Natal. 
  Mr Mandela added the ANC agreed to another constitutional 
principle on the right to self-determination. 
  The concessions appear at face value to meet the demands of 
the Afrikaner right-wing and the Inkatha Freedom Party.

  [Text] ANC [African National Congress] leader Nelson 
Mandela says that if he became elected as South Africa's new 
state president, he would probably hand over the reins to a 
younger man as soon as stability in the country was established. 
Mr. Mandela said on a television program in the Netherlands 
that if the ANC achieves an outright majority in the election, 
he would stay on as president until the new government was 
properly established.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 18 SAPA--The negotiating council 
will convene on Monday to finalise proposed amendments to the 
interim constitution, African National Congress [ANC] Secretary 
General Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday [18 February]. 
Addressing a media briefing at ANC headquarters, Mr Ramaphosa 
disclosed that the ANC met government negotiators on Thursday 
and will meet them again on Friday to thrash out a reformulation 
of provincial powers. 
  Parliament would sit in 10 days time to pass the amendments 
as well as an amendment to the electoral act which will give 
parties another opportunity to register for the April elections. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said an ANC delegation was meeting a delegation 
of the Bophuthatswana government in Rustenburg on Friday to 
discuss concessions announced by ANC President Nelson Mandela 
this week. 
  Another ANC delegation is meeting the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front] on Friday. And an ANC delegation headed by 
Deputy Secretary General Jacob Zuma would shortly meet a 
delegation of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
  Mr Ramaphosa again warned that attempts to disrupt the 
elections would not be tolerated.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 18 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] now accepts the provinces could exercise limited 
exclusive powers, ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa hinted 
on Friday [18 February]. Although it would not extend the list 
of powers it has until now insisted could be exercised 
exclusively but within national framework legislation, the ANC 
would now accept certain powers could be exercised exclusively 
by the provinces. 
  Until now, in terms of the interim constitution, the 
national 
parliament will be able to exercise powers concurrently with the 
provinces -- a position rejected by the Freedom Alliance in 
negotiations since late 1993. 
  In its first shift, the ANC agreed to exclusive powers 
during 
negotiations with the government and the alliance earlier this 
year. However, it insisted such powers had to be exercised 
within national framework legislation. 
  The Freedom Alliance argued this defeated the purpose of 
exclusive powers. It further argued that even the limited 
powers the provinces were granted in the interim constitution 
could be removed once an ANC-dominated constituent assembly sat 
to draft a new constitution after the April elections. 
  An ANC concession to the principle of exclusive powers -- 
even if these are limited to parochial matters now -- and a 
constitutional principle ensuring these powers will not be 
removed, is the furthest the ANC has gone in conceding a 
federal-type dispensation. "The formulation is to effectively 
have a different approach to exclusive powers to that in the 
interim constitution. The actual powers -- the functional areas 
-- will substantially remain the same," Mr Ramaphosa said. 
  A further ANC concession that provinces will be able to 
define their own legislative and executive structures is another 
concession to the provinces. This is further strengthened by an 
agreement that provinces will have their own revenue bases in 
the form of taxes on betting and casinos. 
  Whether the concessions are enough to lure the alliance as a 
whole into the electoral process remains to be seen. Inkatha 
Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has already rejected 
ANC President Nelson Mandela's proposals. 
  But the ANC, Mr Ramaphosa said, was engaged in negotiations 
with elements of the alliance -- namely the Zulu king, the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] of Gen Constand 
Viljoen and the Bophuthatswana government. The negotiations 
with the AVF had reached an advanced stage when Gen Viljoen was 
booed off the stage by Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance 
Movement -- AWB] supporters at an AVF meeting at the end of 
January. 
  According to the agreements, the ANC agreed votes for the 
AVF 
in the elections could be counted as votes for an Afrikaner 
volkstaat [homeland]. Those members of parliament could then 
constitute a volksraad [national council] to push for a 
volkstaat within the constituent assembly. 
  The next two weeks will be a crucial period for the 
transitional process. 
  Parallel to the bilateral talks being conducted between the 
ANC and elements of the Freedom Alliance, the multiparty 
negotiating council will convene on Monday to draw up the 
proposed amendments to the constitution and to the electoral act 
to allow for a few more days for the parties to register. 
  This, Mr Ramaphosa said, would constitute a final deadline 
for parties to take part in the April elections. Parties could 
of course choose to stay out of the process. 
  The sub-script of the ANC's concessions has been a warning 
to 
those who want to disrupt the election not to dare. 
  Mr Ramaphosa warned there was no prospect of the ANC 
agreeing 
to an extension of the election date. And the government agreed 
to this. 
  He said Mr Buthelezi had assured the independent electoral 
commission that polling could take place within kwaZulu. "There 
is a threat to the process," he said. But he was confident the 
security forces would not stand by and tolerate a disruption. 
  Strict application of the laws should ensure the election 
went ahead, however.

  [Text] ANC [African National Congress] leader Nelson 
Mandela has hinted that more concessions could be made in an 
effort to secure the participation of the Freedom Alliance in 
the April election. 
  Mr. Mandela, currently on a visit to The Hague in the 
Netherlands, reacted to the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
response that Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi rejected the 
series of far- reaching concessions to the alliance, by saying 
that it was still too early to assume that Chief Minister 
Buthelezi has turned his back on the proposals. He added that 
it appeared the IFP had left the door open for participation in 
the election. 
  Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg says 
he 
hopes to have full details of the proposals by later today. He 
described the ANC's reference to self-determination as vague and 
said that the CP demanded complete self-determination for the 
Afrikaner in his own territory. 
  The Democratic Party [DP] has welcomed the proposals as a 
meaningful step towards federalism. DP leader Dr. Zach de Beer 
said during his election tour of the Little Karoo that his party 
would support the proposed changes to the interim constitution 
and the Electoral Act. He said he regarded the double ballot 
system as a fundamental right and welcomed the proposed 
increased powers for provinces. 
  Bophuthatswana said that the proposals were very interesting 
and that a full statement would be issued later.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by State President F.W. de Klerk </F>
during the declaration of the old Parliament Buildings and 
Tuynhuys in Cape Town as national monuments on 17 February; on 
the "PM News Wrap" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] President F.W. de Klerk says IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi's negative reaction to the 
government and the ANC's [African National Congress] latest 
constitutional proposals may still change. President de Klerk 
was speaking at a press conference in Cape Town. 
  [Begin recording] [De Klerk] I basically say that there is 
time left, and, as I heard him when he was quoted directly in 
his own voice, it was not all that negative. I really hope that 
all the parties, who have not joined in the election as yet, 
will very seriously consider their position, make a proper 
study, and not take hasty decisions. I think that the initial 
negative reaction might still change to a more positive one. I 
have spoken to him last night. It is not impossible that at the 
moment members of my party and of the government are in 
discussion with members of his party and of his government. We 
have been trying to put it together. It might be taking place 
right at this moment. I haven't been informed. I have been too 
busy thus far. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Is this your final offer? 
  [De Klerk] It is not a question of a final offer. This is a 
substantial improvement from our own vantage point and from the 
vantage point of the Freedom Alliance, as it was. It addresses 
the heart and the core, maybe not exactly as they would 
like....[pauses] They would have liked it to be addressed, but 
it addresses the heart and core of what has been on the table 
and on the agenda. I think it offers substantive reassurance on 
issues of fundamental importance to them and to us as 
federalists, and I think the new principle that the powers will 
not be diminished, that is what it says in essence, in a final 
constitution is a very important reassurance that central 
government will not be in a position, and a new central 
parliament will not be in a position, to undermine the 
fundamental federalist principles already built into this 
constitution. I think it offers a good basis, a good platform 
from which to enter into a final constitution-writing process, 
and I think the right of the provinces, without prescription, to 
determine the composition of their own executors and 
legislators, is also tremendously important. I really think 
that out of hand rejection of this is not justifiable and that 
they should look very, very carefully at it. This is a 
reasonable improvement which forms, in another sense of the 
word, a basis which nobody can any longer say that I am 
justified to stand aside and to disrupt what the overwhelming 
majority of all South Africans want--and that is an election on 
27 April. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Freedom Alliance partners are meeting behind 
closed doors tonight in the wake of the latest concessions on 
constitutional negotiations put forward by the ANC [African 
National Congress] yesterday, but it appears that the Freedom 
Alliance is not impressed with the latest proposals. At Ulundi 
today IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader and kwaZulu Chief 
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said it was incorrect to describe 
the latest proposals as concessions. Other members of the 
Freedom Alliance said the ANC was conducting a publicity 
exercise. Conrad Burke reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Burke] Last night Mr. Mandela said the 
ANC 
had agreed to a double ballot, virtual entrenchment of regional 
constitutions, and greater regional taxation powers. [passage 
omitted] 
  But, says Dr. Buthelezi and the Afrikaner Volksfront's 
[Afrikaner National Front] General Constand Viljoen, the wording 
is vague, they did not like negotiations by press conference, 
and the whole issue would have to be thrashed out by the Freedom 
Alliance partners. 
  [Buthelezi] All that they are referring to is a package 
which 
Mr. Meyer, the minister of constitutional development, offered 
to Freedom Alliance negotiators about two weeks ago. It was a 
package which started with the ballot paper, a double ballot, 
etc., which came from the National Party, which did not go far 
enough to address the issue of the powers of regions. I mean, 
to make certain that there are powers, because even Mr. Mandela 
in his statement just vaguely spoke about powers of regions, in 
a vague sort of way. While one welcomes the idea that 
parliament should be called -- because I think that decision 
needs to serve as a positive thing -- that they are prepared to 
call parliament. One hopes that they are going to use the time 
now, you know, to really, you know, just take that extra mile. 
  [Viljoen] And the question we ask is: Will there really be a 
volkstaat [homeland], because we want the interim constitution 
amended to such an extent that we would like to have the 
volkstaat? My people are claiming the volkstaat to be in 
position before 27 April. Now there is no indication to us that 
this is a finality, and the Afrikaner will not be able to be 
appeased by anything but a very substantial proof that what we 
have in mind for the Afrikaner will eventually materialize. 
[passage omitted] 
  Pan-Africanist Congress leader Clarence Makwetu said the 
organization was still studying the package. He couldn't decide 
yet whether it amounted to a significant offer. 
  [Makwetu] We are not quite certain whether they are 
concessions. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria Feb 17 SAPA--At face value the government 
and African National Congress' [ANC] latest constitutional 
proposals seemed good, but it could be a smoke screen to gain 
the moral high ground and reinforce the Afrikaner Volksfront's 
[National Front -- AVF] image as "spoilers", AVF sources said on 
Thursday [17 February]. 
  Approached for comment the sources however stressed that the 
proposals were still being studied and that comment was 
premature. The package seemed to be a reformulation of the 
initial proposals which had led to the deadlock in trilateral 
talks, they said. "We cannot understand why it is so difficult 
to insert a clause that there `shall' be a volkstaat [homeland]. 
It would be difficult to sell a vague concept or a promise to 
our constituents in this volatile political climate." This 
created the impression that the government and the ANC were not 
totally serious, they said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Carel Boschoff, leader of the Afrikaner </F>
People's Front, by Frederique Sprang in Johannesburg; date not 
given: "Boycott of Legislative Elections by White Extremists"] 
  [Text] [Sprang] Son-in-law of the late Hendrick F. 
Verwoerd, the South African president who hardened apartheid in 
the 1960s, you are, at the age of 65, a leading figure of the 
Afrikaner resistance, after having been grand master of the 
secret society Afrikaner Broederbond for a long time. What do 
you think of the order to boycott the elections issued by your 
organization, the AVF [Afrikaner People's Front]? 
  [Boschoff] I do not think participation in the elections is 
the main priority. What is important is to arrive at the 
establishment of an Afrikaner nation in the existing 
constitutional framework. 
  [Sprang] You are one of those who are demanding the creation 
of an Afrikaner state. Why? 
  [Boschoff] Because of the right of peoples to determine 
their 
own fate. We are a minority in this country. What chance do we 
have as European Whites to live in a state governed by Blacks? 
  [Sprang] You think that Blacks and Whites cannot live 
together? 
  [Boschoff] It is not a question of the color of the skin, 
but 
of culture. We do not speak the same language, we do not have 
the same way of living. I do not think that Africans can live 
like Whites. 
  To live peacefully in this region, the Afrikaners must have 
an independent state which they govern, just like Botswana, 
where the Tswanas live; Lesotho, where the Suthus live; and 
Swaziland, where the Swazis live. You fought the Germans to 
remain Belgians or French. 
  [Sprang] But there is nowhere in South Africa where the 
Afrikaners are in a majority.... 
  [Boschoff] In the region around Orania where we have 
established the foundations of an Afrikaner community, in the 
Northern Cape, the density is two inhabitants per square 
kilometer. Moreover, historically, this region did not belong to 
anybody. 
  [Sprang] But there are many coloreds there and, moreover, 
they speak Afrikaans, your language. 
  [Boschoff] Yes, but they are increasingly inhabiting urban 
areas. It is perfectly possible to find a compromise with them 
to divide up areas. The important thing for an Afrikaner, for a 
Boer, is land. Next comes religion. We are strong Calvinists. 
  [Sprang] However, the government and the ANC [African 
National Congress] do not seem prepared to divide up South 
Africa into ethnic territories, which was the basis of 
apartheid.... 
  [Boschoff] It is not for Mr. Mandela to decide our future. 
It is impossible to deny the demands of a whole people. But 
these leaders must realize that the Afrikaners will never allow 
their nation to be led by Communists. 
  [Sprang] What if the answer tomorrow is no. You are 
boycotting the elections, but what then? 
  [Boschoff] We will take up arms. We have the power to 
paralyze this country.

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Today" program] </F>
  [Text] Democratic Party leader Dr. Zach de Beer says a 
coalition with the National Party after the election is not on. 
He was addressing a public meeting at Oudtshoorn. Richard 
Ingram sent us this report: 
  There was a small but attentive multiracial audience for Dr. 
de Beer at the Democratic Party's first multiracial meeting held 
at the town in many a year, and it was held in Oudtshoorn Civic 
Center, a place that was taboo for nonwhites for many a year. 
  In answer to a question, he said his party would work with 
any parties to vote against the ANC [African National Congress] 
if it was the majority party and threatened to do anything 
harmful to South Africa. Answering another question in 
Afrikaans, Dr. de Beer said a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] was 
just not viable. He also addressed the latest concessions by 
the ANC and the government to the Freedom Alliance on the draft 
constitution in their effort to try and get the alliance to take 
part in the coming election. 
  [De Beer] Ladies and gentlemen, the question of a double or 
a single ballot paper is not just a plaything, a coin to be 
tossed upon a table, to be gambled with. The question of a 
double or a single system brief -- a ballot paper -- is a matter 
of moral conviction. But there's no serious doubt that the 
rights given in the constitution which is before us now, which 
has been adopted by Parliament, are inadequate. They must be 
increased, and they must not be increased because Frank Mdlalose 
wants it or because Ferdi Hartzenberg wants it.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 17 SAPA -- The Pan-Africanist 
Congress' [PAC] youth wing on Thursday asked whether it had to 
kill a journalist to ensure that it got fair media coverage. 
  Azanian National Youth Unity [Azanyu] National Chairman 
Mosotho Petlane said Azanyu's "endurance cup is running out" 
because the media had largely ignored memorial services for 
Azanian Peoples Liberation Army Commander Sabelo Phama. "We 
would like the media to advise us on what we must do. Must we 
kill one journalist before we get fair coverage? Or must we 
demand a PAC volkstaat [homeland]? Or must we threaten a civil 
war?" Mr Petlane asked. 
  He alleged that the SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation] was masterminding a campaign against the PAC. He 
said that of the 17 memorial services for the late commander, 
only one had been partly covered by the media. He said the 
deaths of Chris Hani and Andries Treurnicht had received 
extensive coverage. Freedom of the press was a two-way process, 
he said.

  [Text] Pretoria Feb 18 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel has condemned the PAC's [Pan-Africanist Congress] 
youth wing for its reference on Thursday [17 February] to 
"killing a journalist", saying it would undoubtedly be 
interpreted as encouragement by some members of the organisation 
to do just that. 
  Mr Kriel said the statement, made by Azanian Youth Unity 
National Chairman Mosotho Petlane, was a direct threat to the 
freedom of the press and to democracy itself. "(It) will 
undoubtedly be interpreted by many PAC supporters as direct 
enouragement to murder journalists, who have already on a number 
of occasions been attacked by PAC supporters." 
  Alleging bias by the media, and particularly the SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation], against the PAC, Mr Petlane 
said on Thursday: "We would like the media to advise us on what 
we must do. Must we kill one journalist before we get fair 
coverage? Or must we demand a PAC volkstaat [homeland]? Or 
must we threaten a civil war?" 
  Mr Kriel said in reply to this that he was himself concerned 
about bias by the SABC "at the expense of all except the ANC 
[African National Congress)...(but) it must be realised that no 
free and fair election is possible without a media free of both 
direct and indirect intimidation".

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 18 SAPA -- South Africa's monthly 
trade surplus dived in January as imports grew strongly and 
exports tapered off, figures released Friday by the Customs and 
Excise Department show. 
  The monthly trade surplus in January fell 46 per cent to 
R[rand]1,065-billion from R1,979-billion in December 1993 but 
was up on the surplus in the same month last year of 
R954-million. 
  Imports grew 9.5 per cent to R4,693-billion last month 
against R4,286-billion in the previous month, while exports 
dropped eight per cent to R5,757-billion from R6,265-billion. 
  However, analysts said the first month of the year was 
traditionally quiet for exporters, pointing out January 1994's 
total exports were higher than January 1993's exports of 
R5,097-billion. 
  Imports increased largely due to a 35 per cent surge in the 
import of machinery and mechanical appliances to R1,631-billion 
in January compared to the same month last year. 
  Economists said this was mainly due to plant replacement and 
the higher import propensity which accompanies economic 
recovery, currently being experienced by the country. 
  Imports of base metals, and precious and semi-precious 
stones 
were also substantially higher, as were the imports of animal or 
vegetable fats and oils. 
  Most export categories registered increases over the 
equivalent month in 1993, but the export of precious and 
semi-precious stones slid to R277-million last month compared to 
R400.6-million in January last year.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  ANC, Government in Bid To Accommodate Freedom Alliance -- 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 18 February in a page-12 
editorial believes the government and the African National 
Congress (ANC) "have made a determined bid to accommodate the 
Freedom Alliance [FA]." Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi has "wasted little time in rejecting" the 
ANC concessions. "Buthelezi's stance, which contrasts with the 
more judicious and open-ended reaction of FA chairman Rowan 
Cronje, raises an important question: what concessions has the 
IFP made in the interests of reaching an inclusive settlement?" 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Buthelezi Urged To Show Good Faith -- Whatever Buthelezi 
says, the ANC's latest compromise offer "is a major advance on 
its previous position in one crucial respect: the acceptance 
that regional powers and functions embodied in the interim 
constituion may not be `substantially diminished' by the 
constitutional assembly when it conducts its work after April 
28," declares a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in 
English on 18 February. "Less clear" is what the ANC's proposal 
means in respect of "the powers of regions, both exclusive and 
concurrent, including their powers or rights regarding taxation. 
The ANC is vague on what, if any, further concessions it is 
willing to make on the detail of these provisions, beyond that 
which is already on the table. In this respect, Buthelezi is 
entitled to complain that ANC talk of concessions may be a 
mirage. But it would demonstrate some good faith if he were to 
sit down--either personally or through his senior lieutenants 
and advisers--and begin negotiating that detail." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  ANC Constitutional Proposals--Referring to the 
constitutional 
proposals of the ANC, Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 18 
February in a page-8 editorial says: "We have doubts whether 
the various component parts of the Freedom Alliance are willing 
to subject themselves to the will of the electorate. It seems 
it will be easier to negotiate a deal with the white 
rightwingers than homeland leaders who fear their total demise." 
If the latest initiatives fail it is important that leaders and 
the government "spell out to the country precisely what to 
expect and what contingency measures are to counter rightwing 
violence and the `resistance politics' of the IFP." 
<H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>
  Warnings Signals on Irish Takeover of Argus Newspapers -- 
"There has been great joy in the media about the purchase of 
Argus Newspapers by the Irish-American soup, bean and newspaper 
man, Tony O'Reilly," notes a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg 
WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 18-24 February. "It's 
not 
all that surprising, since most of those commentators are now 
employed by the man." "There are some warning signals that 
should, nevertheless, be sounded by those who don't work for 
him. The first is that press reports have repeatedly cited his 
reputation for non-interference in editorial decisions -- except 
where it involves the IRA. We have heard that before, haven't 
we?" Secondly, "based on the experience of Tiny Rowland and 
Robert Maxwell, we should be wary of newspaper tycoons who 
befriend political. The test will come if O'Reilly's newspapers 
embarrass his powerful friends and endanger his business 
interests. We can't wait for the test!" 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Intimidation Must Be Stopped -- Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans on 15 February says in a page-8 editorial: 
"Intimidation fever is rising. At first it was only words and 
incitement. Now the emotional statements are becoming deeds. 
It is especially prevalent where politcal groups become 
frustrated in fear of change, and where there are no attainable 
alternatives to change." As examples, BEELD refers to the 
Afrikaner National Front's threat to put pressure on the 
election. This could include "`a little bit of violence' in 
self-defense against the ANC. They will not allow the 
constitution to come into operation. Then the ANC's Mr. Tokyo 
Sexwale warned the Freedom Alliance to be careful of their next 
step, adding that `in the past, we died for freedom and the 
liberation of our country. We will not hesitate to do so 
again.' And Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi openly threatened that 
those who ignore the demands of Inkatha must bear the 
consequences." "But the most despicable form of intimidation is 
the cowardly, anonymous right-wing threats to kidnap President 
F. W. de Klerk's 4-year-old grandson in protest over the manner 
in which the National party is leading the country towards a new 
dispensation." This "goes beyond the bounds of election fun. 
Every leader has a great responsibility to encourage his 
followers to exercise calm and tolerance. Offenders must be 
thoroughly disciplined." 
  Zulu Demands -- "Logic and the government dictate that King 
Goodwill Zwelithini's demands can be dealt with inside a federal 
system and the interim constitution; but emotions point to a 
force which is increasingly threatening the unity of South 
Africa," says an editorial on page-8 of the Johannesburg BEELD 
in Afrikaans of 16 February. "It is difficult to imagine how an 
independent, sovereigh Zulu kingdom will be accomdated without 
drastic changes to the present constitutional system. One gets 
the impression that the Zulus, under their king and Chief 
Minister Buthelezi (or is it the other way around?) will not be 
satisfied with any formula which will make them subjects. Their 
statements smack of cessation, even though they have not yet 
used the word."

  [Text] Through its secretary for humanitarian affairs, the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
today condemned the threats that the Luanda government has been 
making concerning humanitarian aid. According to a source in 
that secretariat, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola Labor Party's [MPLA-PT] threats jeopardize the norms of 
the humanitarian organizations and show that Luanda continues to 
manipulate humanitarian aid policy in favor of the government 
and the MPLA-PT. 
  That source also said that UNITA had no responsibility 
whatsoever with the attacks on World Food Program, WFP, aircraft 
in Malange, where, ironically, the People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola are on the offensive and are logistically 
supplied by aircraft. That source added that UNITA will work to 
facilitate humanitarian aid work in Angola, as long as the 
government keeps its distance and stops interfering in the 
distribution of [word indistinct], the WFP's cooking oil, or the 
UNICEF's soap.

<F P=106> [Interview with Norberto dos Santos, minister for assistance </F>
and social reintegration, by People's Television of Angola 
announcer Ana Lemos in the TPA studio in Luanda--live] 
  [Text] [Lemos] Humanitarian aid could be suspended yet 
again if the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] continues to endanger World Food Program, WFP, aircraft. 
After UNITA and the WFP had reached an agreement concerning a 
suspension of hostilities to allow people to receive food aid, 
Jonas Savimbi's men proceeded to shoot at a WFP aircraft 
yesterday, shortly after it had taken off from Malange Airport, 
where it left food aid for the local people. Today Malange was 
again the target for shelling, preventing the arrival of more 
food aid for the people. 
  The decision to suspend humanitarian aid naturally rests 
with 
the government. Norberto dos Santos, minister for assistance 
and social reintegration, is here to comment on that. Good 
evening, Mr. Minister. 
  [Dos Santos] Good evening. 
  [Lemos] To begin with, thank you very much for saying yes to 
our invitation. We would like to know what the situation is now 
concerning humanitarian aid? 
  [Dos Santos] Yes, we were in touch recently with the 
director 
for the unit responsible for coordinating humanitarian aid. He 
is just back from Huambo. He has informed us that he has 
received guarantees from UNITA that flights to Malange could 
resume tomorrow in safety. I would like to let you know here 
that we tried a flight to Malange at about 1400 today. Though 
we had received a report from Huambo that UNITA had already 
given the aforesaid guarantees, unfortunately the aircraft had 
to return to Luanda because it was shot at as it prepared to 
land at Malange Airport. It did not land. 
  Coincidentally, WFP Coordinator Aranda da Silva was still in 
Huambo at the time and he proceeded to get in touch with UNITA 
officials yet again. Mr. Aranda da Silva arrived this evening 
and I was in contact with him less than 10 minutes ago. He came 
back with the guarantee that flights to Malange can resume 
tomorrow. We said we were in agreement that flights should 
resume at 0700 and the government will decide on this matter 
depending on what happens to that flight tomorrow. So, let us 
see what will happen, so we can test the truth of the promises 
UNITA has made to Mr. Aranda da Silva. 
  [Lemos] That means, then, that aid will continue normally? 
  [Dos Santos] Tomorrow, we will conduct our first test flight 
to Malange and, depending on what happens with that flight, all 
other flights may or may not take place. 
  [Lemos] How many flights have been scheduled for tomorrow? 
  [Dos Santos] There were flights to Saurimo, Dundo, Luena, 
Cazombo, (Lumbalanguimbo), Mavinga, Uige, Negage, Huambo, 
Malange, Menongue, Cuito, and M'banza Congo scheduled for 
tomorrow. Flights are also supposed to be leaving Catumbela 
tomorrow for Huambo, Cuito, Malange, and Luena. 
  [Lemos] Mr. Minister: Are there no forecasts concerning 
increased flights to areas in need? For instance, the people of 
Cuito complain about the number of flights to that city. 
  [Dos Santos] Yes, I would like to say that 17 flights have 
been planned for Cuito this week, meaning that 102 tonnes of 
food will be leaving from Luanda for that city. Another 17 such 
flights are also planned for Catumbela, making up a total of 153 
tonnes of food. Added to the aid to be flown from Luanda, a 
total of 255 tonnes are scheduled for Cuito. We are concerned 
about Malange because there have been no flights to that city 
for the last four days and, as everybody knows, the situation 
there is dramatic. That means that some 500 tonnes of food aid 
have not been flown to that city, so we are concerned and we 
hope that things will turn out well tomorrow. 
  [Lemos] May it be so. Once again, thank you for granting us 
this interview. 
  [Dos Santos] Thank you and good night.

<F P=106> [From the Channel Africa report program] </F>
  [Text] The construction of a military air base in Botswana 
is proceeding well despite persisting hostilities toward the 
complex. Our man in Gaborone Lecogile Lucas has this report: 
  The construction of the air base, which is situated 70 
kilometers from the capital city, Gaborone, will cost the 
government of Botswana several million US dollars. The project 
has been dubbed Operation Eagle, allegedly because of the 
involvement of the American Government. 
  Since Operation Eagle started the government has come under 
heavy criticism from many quarters in the country for pumping 
money into the (?army) at a time when peace and democracy were

are saying that the money should be channeled into social 
welfare programs such as health and education which [words 
indistinct] of the population. 
  For its part, the Government of Botswana is repeatedly 
saying 
that the construction of Operation Eagle should not be seen as 
money down the drain, but as laying down a basic military 
infrastructure. 
  Various government top people, including finance minister 
and 
vice president Mr. Festus Mogae have gone on record as saying 
that the country needs the air base because military aggression 
could not be ruled out even though peace and democracy will at 
some point prevail in the region. Project Operation Eagle is 
scheduled to be completed during 1995.

<F P=106> [Report by Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], the

no evidence of General Peace Accord violations. Renamo's 
Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo's accusations that General 
Eduardo da Silva Nihia was training men to fight Renamo after 
elections have been denied by General Raul Dique, head of the 
Renamo team to the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF]. Let us listen 
to an excerpt of the interview I had with him at the Military 
Club in Maputo this morning. 
  [Begin recording] [Matos] What are the findings at this 
stage? 
  [Dique] The (?commission) [words indistinct] men being 
trained to fight Renamo after elections. At this stage, men are 
assembled... 
  [Matos] Lt. Gen. Mr. Ngonhamo said that Mr. Nihia was 
training men to fight Renamo to disrupt elections. Is that 
(?true)? 
  [Dique] Well, the truth is that people were found, and at 
the 
time they were not undergoing training. Obviously, if they had 
been undergoing training previously, once everything was brought 
to the press it was easy to stop the whole thing. 
  [Matos] What does Renamo think? After this report by the 
commission that has gone to investigate the matter, does it 
think that men were being trained to fight Renamo (?after) the 
election? 
  [Dique] Well, when the investigating team got to the area, 
it 
did not see any men undergoing training. There is no 
confirmation that men had been trained there before. That side 
of things was not investigated. 
  [Matos] What is Renamo's opinion now? 
  [Dique] Renamo's opinion is that training is not happening 
any more. People (?are being) moved now to assembly areas. 
  [Matos] Is Renamo satisfied with those results? 
  [Dique] Renamo is satisfied because it was disappointed with 
the confinement of the forces and its conclusions are that, 
under the control of the regional CCF team, all forces that are 
assembled in that area [words indistinct] satisfied. 
  [Matos] Kindly tell me something, Gen. Dique: The problem 
that Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo raised, and his accusations in regard to 
Mr. Nihia, are now a thing of the past? The matter has been 
clarified? 
  [Dique] It has been clarified now because those forces will 
be removed from that area and there will be no problems. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Renamo President Afonso Dhlakama by Almiro </F>
Santos; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Santos] What does the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] think about the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo]? 
  This is an interesting question. First, it believes that 
Frelimo is not interested in elections being held in October, as 
scheduled. 
  The reasons for thinking so? 
  Afonso Dhlakama replied that the Frelimo Party "is making 
time to try and change its Marxist image." 
  In his interview, the Renamo leader also reexamined the 
stance he defended at one stage, that the electoral process 
should be organized with the troops being confined. 
  He explains that his views were poorly understood at the 
time. This is an interview in which Afonso Dhlakama tried to 
make himself understood... 
  In your opinion, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, why is the troop 
confinement process lagging behind? Is it or is it not a 
political problem? 
  [Dhlakama] I am going to make a serious accusation. I do not 
think that Frelimo would like to participate in the October 
elections. To them, that will be much too early. 
  [Santos] Do you think that Frelimo is not ready? 
  [Dhlakama] Yes, I think that they are not ready. They have 
been caught by surprise. Frelimo needs more time to try and 
improve its image. 
  [Santos] What image is that? 
  [Dhlakama] Its Marxist image. The party has to change from a 
Marxist to a democratic party with new ideas. The problem is 
that it has only a short time in which to do so. 
  Concerning the troop confinement process, they too are aware 
that, in terms of what we have agreed, elections cannot be held 
with two armies still in place. Both the Mozambican people and 
the international community want only one unified army by the 
time elections are held... 
  [Santos] But, Mr. Dhlakama, you once defended the view that 
elections should be held with the troops being confined.... 
  [Dhlakama] I did not insist on that point. What happened was 
that I was misunderstood. What I said was: "given that Frelimo 
is complicating things and that Renamo wants elections by 
October, we could go to elections even with two armies." 
  [Santos] And how would that leave the troops, in terms of 
command? 
  [Dhlakama] Renamo has had and has now the capacity to tell 
its troops not to disturb the process. That was what I said 
and, because I am aware of the dangers, I never insisted on 
going to elections without the troops being confined. 
  However, now I want to accuse Frelimo of resorting to 
tactics 
aimed at delaying the electoral process. They want to gain time. 
  [Santos] Why would they want to do that? 
  [Dhlakama] They know that there will be no elections in 
October unless the new army has been formed. And because there 
will be no elections in October, we will have to postpone. 
[sentence as published] Postpone to when? To November? The rains 
begin in November, so they will have to be moved to 1995. And 
when will they take place in 1995? In January? You still have 
rains then. It also rains in February, March, and April. 
Perhaps we will only have elections by May of next year. 
  [Santos] So, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, your opinion is that 
Frelimo only wants elections to be held next year? 
  [Dhlakama] You can be sure about that. That is the way many 
Frelimo members want it, but that is extremely dangerous. 
Speaking as a Mozambican rather than as Renamo leader, I feel 
that that situation is extremely dangerous. 
  [Santos] Why do you perceive it to be dangerous? 
  [Dhlakama] We have already been warned by the international 
community that it will withdraw its observers because they 
cannot remain eternally involved in the UN Operations in 
Mozambique. What happens is that the money will run out. They 
have planned for everything to have been done by the end of 
October. By delaying things, they would have maximum certainty 
that the United Nations will pull out and there is bound to be 
confusion once there are no observers. I am afraid of such a 
situation and that is why I would like to call on my brethren in 
government to accelerate the confinement process. 
  [Santos] And what about Renamo? 
  [Dhlakama] I am ready. For instance, our General Mateus 
Ngonhamo will leave on Monday to inspect the assembly areas, to 
select 2,500 men for the new army and to see when the training 
of the 5,000 men will get under way. 
  [Santos] That means, then, that Renamo already has men ready 
to join the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM? 
  [Dhlakama] It has and that is no political propaganda, 
either. We are going to the assembly areas where more men have 
been confined. 
  [Santos] Those men will be chosen to go to Nacala? 
  [Dhlakama] I do not know where they will undergo their 
training. That is another problem. Frelimo is also delaying 
the rehabilitation of the training camps. Nothing has been 
done about that yet. Nothing, really nothing. That task has 
been turned over to the Mozambican Government. Immediately when 
we had signed the General Peace Accord, it became clear that the 
Mozambican Government would be responsible for rehabilitating 
the training centers. However, nothing has happened so far. We 
are going to apply pressure, the people are going to apply 
pressure, and the international community will also apply 
pressure because we do not want this to fail. 
  For instance, we do not have the money to go to elections, 
but we have to go to elections. They are worth being held. 
  [Santos] This trip (we were on the eve of his departure) you 
are about to make to South Africa, will it be to gather funds 
for the elections? 
  [Dhlakama] No, absolutely not. This trip is part of routine 
visits to all neighboring countries. Last year, I went to 
Botswana and to Zambia. I am preparing visits to Namibia, 
Tanzania, and Swaziland. Now, this visit to South Africa is 
very important because it occurs shortly before that country is 
due to hold its first multiracial elections. 
  [Santos] In concrete terms, what are you going to do in 
South 
Africa? 
  [Dhlakama] I would like to hold talks with some opposition 
parties, with the most important party in South Africa -- that 
is the African National Congress, ANC -- so that the ANC gets to 
know Renamo better. In addition to that, I intend meeting South 
African businessmen. At this stage, there are many South 
African businessmen here, but they are only investing in favor 
of the government. As an opposition force, we do need to know 
who is investing in the country. So, I am going to hold talks 
with them to know what investments can be made in the future. 
So far, only the South African Government and Frelimo have 
participated in investment talks. This is why we want to come 
into the game now and learn what their policy is with regard to 
investments in our country. 
  [Santos] Is that for them to invest in areas controlled by 
Renamo? 
  [Dhlakama] Nothing like that. You must keep it mind that 
only a few months separate us from elections and that it would 
be pointless for the Renamo leader to be urging people to invest 
in Renamo-controlled areas now. The fact is that those areas 
are disappearing! 
  [Santos] The advisers to the provincial governors have 
already been appointed. Will their appointments facilitate the 
administrative integration of Renamo-controlled areas? 
  [Dhlakama] The famous list of provincial governor advisers 
has already been handed over, but they have not been sworn in 
yet. I think that as soon as President Chissano returns (the 
Mozambican head of state was in Switzerland, at the time), they 
will be sworn in and they will be able to start working with the 
governors, thereby making it easier for the provincial governors 
to get acquainted with statistics and with probems in their 
provinces. 
  So, Renamo is no longer interested in asking for investments 
for its areas. Our interest is to talk with them, to learn how 
they plan to invest in the future, in a country that is already 
democratic. 
  [Santos] Mr. Afonso Dhlakama: going back to the issue of 
elections, how much would your party have to participate in 
elections? 
  [Dhlakama] I cannot say what the amount would be. I know 
that journalists complicate things a great deal.... The fact is, 
I cannot say how much, but it is not easy, nor is it good for 
Renamo to create the impression that we are begging for money. 
  Renamo does not beg for money. In concrete terms, it asks 
for the means for the party to create its own infrastructure. 
By talking about money, we would be creating a poor image for 
ourselves. For instance, when I talk about the party's 
infrastructure, I mean I want houses, but if I have money, I can 
buy the keys and get houses. That is why either houses or money 
will do. Another example is that I would like the money to buy 
vehicles, but I cannot go about always asking for money. If a 
country makes available, for instance, 25 vehicles, 45 Land 
Rover vehicles, I shall say thank you very much, because that 
will be more than $1 million. What happens here is that we do 
not say so many millions of dollars, because then we would be 
confusing the international community and we would be creating a 
negative image for Renamo, which would then seem to be 
constantly begging for money. 
  [Santos] That means, then, that Renamo is not asking for 
money? 
  [Dhlakama] Renamo is not asking for money. Renamo is 
complaining about a lack of means to build infrastructure to 
allow the party to function. Now, someone could indeed give us 
money, somebody else could give us a typewriter, and somebody 
else could give us vehicles. 
  [Santos] Could that be a reason for Renamo to delay the 
process: the lack of human and material means? In fact, a 
government official has said that Renamo is the one that is not 
ready and that it is looking for cadres. Is this true? 
  [Dhlakama] How can Frelimo prove that, when I am stating 
here 
that I have more troops confined, even though my forces are 
facing terrible conditions? My soldiers have had to go 200, 150 
km in terrible conditions, barefoot, through Mozambique's 
jungle, to reach their assembly areas. That fact is obvious 
proof that they want elections held this year. 
  Who does not want the troops to be confined? It is the 
government! The government is confining its forces in villages. 
Its forces only have to move some 500 meters. It is near their 
barracks. When the government says that it does not have the 
means to take its troops to the assembly areas, any child 
promptly realizes that that is not a valid argument. It is 
nothing. If Frelimo wanted to do so, it could confine 30,000 
men in their assembly areas in 24 hours. 
  [Santos] Was nothing planned concerning the movement of 
Renamo troops to their assembly areas? 
  [Dhlakama] No, that had not been planned or discussed 
before, 
but it was generally said that Unomoz would make transportation 
available -- but there you have it, our troops are going on 
foot. Nevertheless, the most important thing is that they are 
arriving at their assembly areas. 
  I would like to touch again on that issue of Renamo drafting 
cadres. The fact is, there is nobody that is not looking for 
cadres. Frelimo itself is drafting cadres! We are seeing new 
faces in the Frelimo Party, they are being sworn in. Yet that 
should not be an impediment to elections. We were already 
drafting cadres when we were still in the bush. Frelimo itself 
may have been in power for 18 years, but it is still changing 
ministers and it grabbing people who complete their university 
studies. It is not just Renamo that is doing so. Everybody is 
doing it. 
  [Santos] Does Renamo have enough cadres to fill the seats 
that it may eventually have in Parliament? 
  [Dhlakama] Renamo has enough cadres at this stage to be 
candidates in the Assembly and, should Renamo win the upcoming 
elections, it has already organized people to participate in 
government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Manuel Tome, Frelimo Central Committee </F>
secretary for mobilization and propaganda, by Almiro Santos; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Dhlakama gave a warning before he spoke. 
  He said: "I am going to make a serious accusation." And he 
did. 
  He said that the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] was 
not interested in elections being held this year. 
  However, Manuel Tome, Frelimo Central Committee secretary 
for 
mobilization and propaganda, believes the accusations that have 
come from the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] are 
"baseless, unfounded, and unnecessary." 
  What is more, they mean that Renamo gauges itself in terms 
of 
its ability to make such baseless, unfounded, and unnecessary 
accusations. 
  The most important thing, though, is that the Frelimo Party 
is interested in participating in the elections in October. 
Manuel Tome noted that "there is no one, and in particular 
there is no official -- President Joaquim Chissano, in this 
instance -- interested in delaying holding elections." 
  The Frelimo Central Committee official added that "Frelimo 
has been ready for elections since last year." 
  [Santos] Is Frelimo ready for elections or is it not? 
  [Tome] I answered that very same question at the beginning 
of 
last year. My reply was that the Frelimo Party was ready, even 
at that time. Now, in addition to being ready for elections, 
the Frelimo Party will also do everything to ensure they will be 
held as scheduled. 
  Had Mr. Afonso Dhlakama read that interview, he would 
probably have had some reference for guidance, at least. 
  However, when we talk about being ready, we need to note 
that 
there are various levels of preparedness. There is 
organizational, conceptual, and strategic preparedness for 
elections. At another level, there is also the involvement of 
militants and sympathizers, the people who will after all 
implement the electoral strategy devised by the party. 
  With regard to the fundamental things, we are both organized 
and prepared. There are, it is true, some details about which I 
cannot talk because, obviously, one cannot go about broadcasting 
what the party's electoral strategy or organizational approach 
will be or, eventually, we would be helping others defeat us. 
  [Santos] You have said that the Frelimo Party has been ready 
for elections since last year. Has anything changed that state 
of affairs? 
  [Tome] I would not say that it has changed. We were ready at 
that time because, for instance, basic conditions were already 
in place. Since then, those conditions have become more solid. 
You must be aware that we started preparing ourselves with a 
view to elections being held last year. 
  Obviously, there are certain things that you should only do 
when you are certain that elections will be held at the 
appointed date, or you may end up wasting money and the efforts 
made by party militants on work that will serve no purpose 
whatever. I am talking, for instance, about what is commonly 
referred to as the precampaign and the electoral campaign 
itself. That is where you put up money and use the militants' 
efforts. 
  In addition to that, there is a level of involvement by the 
militants themselves, who are full time workers with the party. 
Obviously, they are involved in the party's work, but the 
intensity of their commitment to that work tends to grow. 
  [Santos] So, Frelimo believes that elections will be held in 
October? 
  [Tome] I believe elections will take place in October, 
barring last minute obstacles caused by people acting in bad 
faith. Frelimo wants elections held this year as scheduled, and 
there are many reasons for wanting to do so. 
  You know that the movement of Mozambicans being repatriated 
from other countries is greatly limited by the uncertainty we 
currently experience. People want elections to be held so they 
can then start working to restore normality in the country. 
  Economic activity will not occur at the pace or with the 
effectiveness we would desire, if uncertainty continues to beset 
this country for the next two or three years. Then, there is a 
third factor: psychological saturation. That means that people 
will no longer tolerate this whole situation and that could yet 
have some effect on voter turnout. Postponements make people 
start to lose confidence in the process and when the time for 
elections comes, they will say: I am not going to vote because I 
do not trust this process any more. 
  Thus, it is imperative that elections be held at the 
appointed date and I would like to believe that, should the 
aforementioned obstacles appear, they will be promptly dealt 
with and removed, whether it be done by the Mozambican or the 
international community. 
  [Santos] That would mean, then, that there is no truth to 
Renamo's view that Frelimo is making time to try and rid itself 
of its Marxist image? 
  [Tome] I do know whether the Renamo president knows what it 
means to be a Marxist or whether he knows the meaning of the 
word Marxism. When the Frelimo Party held its Fifth Congress 
in 1989, it decided to withdraw Marxism as the party's official 
doctrine. It was not taking a stand against Marxism. That must 
be made clear. We have a party that is pluralist within itself, 
meaning that people have the freedom to think, to propose 
things, and to make choices, as long as those ideas do not 
contravene the principles and the program of the party. 
  We have no need to clean up any image. In fact, were I to 
ask the journalists how many Marxists Frelimo had.... We have a 
very big party, with more than 850,000 members and it cannot be 
supposed that all those 850,000 members are Marxists. In other 
words, at the time, we had the party's official doctrine, which 
did not even correspond to the party's great mass of militants 
in real terms. 
  Marxism is a philosophy and a conception of an economic 
system, and so forth, and I fail to see that we need to rid 
ourselves of it, as is often said, because nothing causes us any 
guilt or any other complexes. To my knowledge, there are 
Marxist parties to this day. What is more, there are even 
communist parties. There is a communist party in neighboring 
South Africa. There are communist parties in Portugal and 
Greece. Such parties do exist. There are other parties that 
have adapted and even changed their names, like Italy's 
Democratic Leftist Party, for instance. 
  As far as I know, no one has ever been condemned for being a 
Marxist, though I know that many people have been condemned and 
continued to be condemned the world over for terrorist 
practices. That much I know. 
  [Santos] Are you talking about anyone in particular? 
  [Tome] I have not mentioned any name in particular. However, 
we shall soon see if the cap fits somebody in particular. 
  [Santos] If the elections are not held at the appointed 
date, 
do you think we will be faced with a chaotic situation? 
  [Tome] I would not say chaotic, because if there were to be 
chaos it would have happened during the war. During the war, 
there were far more reasons for chaos. Yet, we did not have 
chaos even then. And if we did not have chaos then, that was 
because the government of this country, the Frelimo government, 
was able to govern in a situation of war. I am not implying in 
any way that it was a spotless government. I do not have any 
such pretension, but it is true that the Frelimo government was 
able to run the country despite the war. To refute that is to 
refute factual evidence: this country is still standing and it 
is moving toward regaining normality. 
  Now, chaos can be created, just as war can be created. That 
is what I mean, there is the need to prevent people who act or 
intend to act in bad faith from creating obstacles to this whole 
process. After all, what is it that we want with elections? We 
want the country to move toward a new situation, whereby all 
Mozambican citizens, irrespective of their political, 
philosophical, or religious beliefs, can participate in the life 
of the nation and seek to realize their individual aspirations. 
I would have preferred to say that elections must be held by 
October, instead of trying to imagine a hypothetical situation 
in which elections would not take place. 
  I think that everyone -- the international community too -- 
is interested in seeing them go ahead. UN Special 
Representative Aldo Ajello has said elections must be held. The 
president of the Republic has said the same. We have been 
saying soHevery day and we reiterate it now. 
  [Santos] One of the things Renamo has been saying is that it 
does not have money to participate in the elections. Does the 
Frelimo Party have money? 
  [Tome] The costs involved in an electoral campaign are so 
massive that I do not believe there is any party that can claim 
to have enough funds for a campaign. I do not believe that, 
particularly in light of the situation the country is in, at 
this time. 
  It is true that Frelimo has existed for a lot longer, it has 
been in existence for the better part of 32 years, so it has 
greater financial stability. However, greater financial 
stability does not mean that it has enough money. It has 
greater financial stability than the other parties which have 
surfaced lately and which are probably still organizing their 
financing sources. 
  I have talked about organization which does indeed include 
gathering money. That is normal and it happens with any party 
in the world. We are doing work, ranging from small to rather 
mroe complex tasks, that involve studies and serious work with 
experts. 
  A militant can set up some sort of gathering, he or she can 
invite other militants to join in and the money can be turned 
over to the party, or it can be a bigger thing, like a musical 
show, for instance. 
  [Santos] Is Rovuma Hotel one of the Frelimo Party's sources 
for gathering funds? 
  [Tome] Rovuma Hotel is one of the institutions owned by our 
party, but we have several sources for gathering funds. Many 
people think that Rovuma Hotel is a great source of revenue, but 
the truth is that it is not. We have in excess of 800,000 
members and those members pay their fees. It is true that we 
must take note of the fact that many members do not pay their 
fees, basically because of organizational reasons. We have many 
militants on the ground. There are displaced people who do not 
even have the means to survive on, let alone to pay their dues 
to the party. Nonetheless, militant fees are an important 
source of revenue to the party. 
  [Santos] One of the consequences of the one-party system is 
the following: the state is confused with the party and with 
the government. Does the Frelimo Party continue to use state 
property for its own operation? 
  [Tome] No. What property? We use no state property at all. 
We can talk about that because there is nothing that has not 
been made public, even the party's secretary general has already 
talked about it. There is a small portion of our budget that is 
financed by the state, taking into account the fact that we are 
in the Assembly of the Republic. It is true that it is a 
one-party Assembly, but that situation is already history 
because we are going to have a new Assembly with other parties 
and they will get their share in line with the seats they get in 
that institution. 
  However, we do not use state property. Reports that we use 
state-owned vehicles and all the rest are rather unwarranted 
claims. In this instance, I am talking of people, but there also 
certain political parties. 
  A party's capacity, maturity, and quality cannot be measured 
in terms of its ability to make accusations. Those qualities 
must be assessed in terms of its ability to present a convincing 
program to the people. They are assessed in terms of the 
ability to adapt to the political situation and make important 
contributions to the country. 
  It is true that, by definition, the opposition must oppose 
the ruling party. Were it not so, the opposition party would be 
a part of the ruling party and we would not be interested in 
that. In fact, I must tell you that, as a Mozambican, I would 
be proud if I heard people say, whether inside or outside this 
country, that the Mozambican parties are strong, mature, and 
have clear goals. 
  You, the journalists, are here to present Renamo's 
accusations, most of which are unfounded, which means that 
Renamo assesses its own capacity in terms of its ability to make 
unfounded, baseless, and needless accusations against the ruling 
party. 
  So, we do not need to make secret moves at that level. Such 
moves are for the police and other such institutions. When I 
say secret, I mean things that must be kept from public 
knowledge. 
  The Frelimo Party will continue to adopt a serious stance in 
this process. We are not going to follow up each and every 
accusation. I think it more important for us to mobilize and 
train our militants so they become more knowledgeable about the 
situation in the country and about concepts concerning the 
electoral process. 
  I think it must be made clear to all that those who accuse 
must produce evidence. I must not come here and say that 
journalists are liars, now prove that you are not. I must 
produce evidence to the effect that someone lied at a certain 
point, on a certain page, and in such and such edition. 
  It is said that Frelimo does not want elections held this 
year. Who has said so? Frelimo's supreme leader has said that 
elections must happen this year and he continues to say so. In 
addition to the party work he has done, he has also made 
personal efforts, because he has more than just the 
responsibility of participating in the management of the peace 
process. He has the responsibility of managing the whole 
country. No leader -- President Joaquim Chissano included -- is 
interested in seeing the current situation continue.

  [Text] With the exception of the Mozambique People's 
Progress Party [PPPM], which gave a short reply, and other 
parties, which did not bother to reply our questionnaire, the 
foreign policy favored by the three parties -- the Mozambican 
Nationalist Movement [Monamo], the Mozambican National Union 
[Unamo], and the Mozambique Democratic Party [Pademo] -- is more 
or less the same and, curiously, coincides with the foreign 
policy of the ruling party, the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo]. 
  Basically, what the three parties favor is a policy of 
cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of 
respect for the sovereignty of each country, respect and 
noninterference in internal affairs of each country. What 
differs, apparently, are the priorities to be taken into 
account. Some consider cooperation with the five 
Portuguese-speaking African countries to be a priority, while 
others give priority to regional cooperation. 
  This theme -- foreign policy -- is the last part of the list 
of questions that DOMINGO sent to registered political parties, 
excluding Frelimo. 
  We had formulated our question in the following manner: a) 
What are the priorities in a political relationship? b) What 
are the strategies to reduce (or eliminate) foreign debt? c) 
What is your assessment of the Nongovernmental Organizations 
[NGOs]? d)What regional integration projects--the Southern 
African Development Community [SADC] and the Common Market for 
Eastern and Southern Africa [Comesa]--do support? e) Of the 
economic, social, and cultural exchange policies, what are the 
priorities? f) Is there a need to join the Commonwealth? And 
finally, g) What are the criteria to choose the best economic 
partner? 
<H5>  Monamo </H5>
  In international relations, priority will be given to 
respect 
for the treaties and protocols signed with the Mozambican State. 
  Monamo/PMSD will strengthen further international relations 
with neighboring countries and developed countries that have 
been economically assisting and expressing solidarity with 
Mozambique. 
  Foreign Debt: This is a burden that the country will have to 
reduce through increased productivity and export of surplus 
produce or essentials, such as the Cahora Bassa power supply, 
transportation to landlocked countries, mining, timber, prawns, 
and so on. 
  The foreign debt should be renegotiable and capable of being 
canceled, with a safe and feasible repayment policy. 
  The NGO's will have to be studied case by case to understand 
their specific work and assess its national interest. 
Monamo/PMSD's attitude regarding NGO's is however to recognize 
their solidarity gesture. 
  d) [as published] Regarding the policy of regional economic 
integration, we feel that, before integration, we have to 
organize our own house so that the country can benefit from the 
institutional advantages of economic integration. It is first 
necessary to achieve internal stability so that we can have a 
true integration and not just copy what we see happening in 
other parts of the world. 
  e) Regarding the policy of economic, social, and cultural 
exchange, this will depend on the degree of relationship. It 
should not be a political choice but an exchange based on 
advantages obtained therefrom. 
  Monamo/PMSD will be governed by pragmatic principles, 
without 
forgetting the natural cultural, lingusitic, and economic 
interdependence. 
  Fortunately, the country, under a social-democratic 
government led by Monamo, will not be tied to ideological or 
political interests, but national interests, respecting 
diplomatic and international principles. 
<H5>  Unamo </H5>
  Foreign Policy a) Establishment of amicable relations with 
all southern African countries, Portuguese-speaking countries, 
African countries, and other countries in the world in general, 
on the basis of mutual respect for each state, noninterference 
in the internal affairs, and mutual benefit. 
  b) We have a potentially rich country. By granting 
investment facilities to nationals, it would be easy to reduce 
the foreign debt. This has not been possible because the policy 
on the country's production and development followed by the 
government over the past 18 years was disastrous. 
  c) NGO's are welcome because they assisted the Mozambican 
people during the 18 disastrous years under the ruling 
Government. They can continue in the country, assisting the 
Mozambican people in other fields for the country's speedy 
reconstruction and development. 
  d) As is the case of the EEC in Europe, a similar 
organization in Southern Africa would be beneficial. This will 
depend on the development of the Comesa and SADC however. 
  e) The policy of economic, social, and cultural exchange, 
should be geared first to the countries of the region, 
Portuguese-speaking countries, Western countries, and -- taking 
into account current changes -- former East European countries, 
as well as Nonaligned countries, depending on these countries' 
interest. 
  f) Since Mozambique is a now a democratic country, based on 
the rule of law, there is every interest to remove the country 
from its current misery. Thus, if the Commonwealth expresses 
interest, we shall certainly join it. 
  g) All countries that want to invest in the country are 
welcome, provided they have good humanitarian intentions. There 
is a need to respect national policy, because we shall not 
accept the country's monopoly in the benefit of foreign 
interests. Thus, we are open to countries like Italy and 
others, as long as they respect the principles mentioned above.

<H5>  Pademo </H5>
  Pademo favors a foreign policy of national independence, 
solidarity, and cooperation with all countries in the world. 
Cooperation and international relations should be extended to 
diplomatic, economic, scientific, and cultural fields, among 
others. 
  The principle of mutual respect among peoples and national 
sovereignty, as well as equality among sovereign States, is 
fundamental for relations and international cooperation. These 
two fields are interdependent and their development demand the 
centralization of defined tasks. The noninterference in the 
internal affairs of other States defended by our party include 
the rejection of the use of economic and military power to 
impose on other countries a political and social system, against 
the wish of the majority of their people. 
  The development of relations with all countries worldwide 
will be promoted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation. The present Higher Institute for 
International Relations and the School of Journalism should be 
transformed into an academic and technical institute. The 
resulting institution should be similar to "business schools" 
existing in other countries. 
  Pademo is aware of the deep historical links which exist 
with 
Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking African countries. With 
these countries, we favor special relations on the basis of 
mutual and balanced interests. Pademo also favors the 
continuation of existing relations with Latin American countries 
with which our country signed different kinds of accords, within 
the framework of world solidarity and promotion of technical and 
scientific development in Mozambique. 
  The party respects principles contained in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Charter and advocates the 
adoption of a foreign policy which favors peace and views 
negotiations as the best form to resolve international conflicts. 
  In brief, the policy defended by Pademo in the field of 
international relations and cooperation, is aimed at achieving 
and promoting the following objectives: 

  -  Promotion and defense of national interests. 
  -  Promotion of human solidarity and mutual respect among 
peoples 
and nations. 
  -  Promotion of international cooperation to consolidate 
universal 
peace and eliminate discrimination in all its forms. 
  -  Respect for the international law and obligations in 
treaties, 
as well as the solution of international disputes, through 
negotiatioon, mediation, reconciliation, arbitration, and 
adjudication. 
  -  Promotion of a new more just world economic order which will 
allow less developed countries to find acceptable solutions for 
problems facing their peoples. 

<H5>    Defense of African Unit and Regional Economic Organizations: </H5>
  The OAU, based in Addis Ababa, played an important role in 
the struggle for political independence of many African 
countries, including our country. The assistance given by this 
organization to liberation movements, mainly based in Tanzania, 
is unparalleled. 
  During the present moment, the struggle for political 
independence is almost over and most African countries are 
carrying out internal reforms to democratize their societies. 
Conscious of the historical responsibilities of the OAU, Pademo 
supports the role of this organization in its struggle for the 
economic independence of the continent. This constitutes a new 
phase of struggle for the emancipation of Africans. 
  It was on the basis of resolutions and recommendations by 
the 
OAU heads of state, particularly in the Lagos Plan of Action, 
that regional organizations, such as Southern African 
Development Coordination Conference [SADCC], the Preferential 
Trade Area [PTA], and others were born. The aim was for African 
countries to form firm fronts of struggle for economic, 
scientific, and social development. Our party support for these 
organizations is unconditional. It is our hope that through 
these organizations, we shall be able to reduce the gap of 
inequality in various fields between our continent and other 
continents. 
  The objectives defined by African leaders for the promotion 
of cooperation between African countries, have not had the 
desired effect, because of lack of implementation of approved 
decisions. It is not only because of lack of means that 
regional projects are not being implemented. Thus, Pademo 
recommends the adoption of new attitudes in economic, 
scientific, and other kind of cooperation among African 
countries. 
  United Nations: The United Nations is an organ that 
includes most of the world's independent countries. It is made 
up of various agencies that specialize in various areas. Its 
principal aims are to promote well-being, justice, and peace in 
the world. 
  Our party's pacifist policy faithfully and actively supports 
the resolutions made democratically by UN organs with a view to 
a peaceful settlement of problems among nations. 
  By the same token, the party advocates: 

  -  A policy of neutrality; 
  -  Promoting and upholding the policy of nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons; 
  -  Eliminating all kinds of mass extermination weapons; 
  -  Promoting a policy of noninterference in the internal affairs 
of other countries; 
  -  Promoting a good neighborliness policy. 

    b) [as published] Only by seeking greater efficiency will it 
be possible to make sound use of the debts we assume, or they 
will never benefit the Mozambican people. Debts must be 
assumed, but in a planned manner. It is not possible to avoid 
them. 
  c) The nongovernmental organizations [NGO's] must operate in 
this country in a well planned manner, without interfering with 
the work of the state and without conflicting interests among 
themselves. Coordination between NGO's and the state shall 
always be recommended and the executive must create mechanisms 
for that purpose. 
  d) It is important that the aims and the nature of Southern 
African Development Community, SADC, and the "contested" Comesa 
within the southern African context. Some actions by those 
organizations suggest their aims are political rather than 
economic. Pademo recommends a cautious approach by those 
organizations and it believes that true economic integration 
will only be possible with the reduction of development 
imbalances in the various countries that are members of those 
organizations. However, membership in those organizations is 
important and operational mechanisms must be treated with 
caution. 
  e) Annex c) answers this question. 
  f) Pademo does not see the need for Mozambique to integrate 
the Commonwealth, just as it sees no need for it to become part 
of the Organization of Islamic Countries. We believe those were 
opportunistic moves by the Frelimo government in a bid to secure 
support from countries that are members of those organizations. 
  g) Criteria for choosing economic partners will depend on 
the 
country's economic climate. However, our party does not exclude 
economic cooperation with any country, as long as it also 
includes economic advantages for this country. Moreover, Pademo 
believes cooperation should be as diversified as possible to 
prevent complete dependence on a single economic, scientific, or 
technical partner. In regard to the advantages of cooperation at 
large, it is important to note that Pademo believes Italy has 
played a very important role in our country's political and 
economic life. We should not blame foreigners alone if the 
things that are built do not work. It is an open secret that 
one of our society's major problems has to do with project 
management. 
  To the Mozambique People's Progress Party, PPPM, "the 
concrete strategy for pulling the country out of its economic 
chaos, achieving social progress, and pursuing a foreign policy 
is to introduce federalism, meaning political decentralization 
comprising statutory, basic legislative, and general political 
powers, in addition to administrative, economic, and financial 
autonomy." [sentence as published]

  [Text] Windhoek February 17 SAPA -- President Sam Nujoma 
would be the ruling SWAPO [South-West African People's 
Organization] party's sole presidential candidate in Namibian 
elections next year, SWAPO said on Thursday [17 February]. 
  This ought to make it clear there was no divisions in the 
party which swept to victory in the 1989 election and took power 
at independence the next year, SWAPO Secretary General Moses 
Garoeb said. 
  He said SWAPO was confident of winning at least a two-thirds 
majority in the 1995 elections, conceding that this was not good 
for democracy. "Perhaps we will have to create our own 
opposition." 
  The Namibian political opposition was weak, he said, but 
this 
was their own fault for "being puppets and traitors during the 
liberation struggle". 
  SWAPO's Central Committee is to discuss its election 
strategy 
and the financial and political state of the party at its 
congress on Saturday.

  [Text] Cape Town Feb 17 SAPA -- An international agreement 
to transfer the South African military base and Rooikop airport 
at Walvis Bay to the Namibian Government at the end of February 
was signed at the Castle in Cape Town on Thursday. In the 
process, equipment valued at R[rand]6.5 million will be donated 
and transferred. 
  The agreement, signed by the defence ministers of South 
Africa and Namibia, Kobie Coetsee and Peter Mweshihange, was 
described by Mr Coetsee as signalling the end and beginning of 
an era. "The new era represents the spirit of mutual 
understanding that exists on defence matters between the two 
governments. It also signifies the beginning of an era in which 
southern Africa could proceed with security co-operation on a 
country-to-country and on a multilateral basis. The time has 
come for the countries of the region to work in earnest to 
improve the quality of life of all our people, and for that 
purpose mutual schemes and projects could be explored." 
  Mr Coetsee said he believed it would also enable Namibia to 
have "a more appropriate window to the outside world" and add to 
the completion of the country's international status. 
  Mr Mweshihange said the signing was a vindication that 
peacefultco-existence could work where those involved were 
committed. "What we have witnessed is a complete new chapter in 
the relationship between our two countries and defence forces. 
It is a chapter characterised by peace and mutual 
understanding." 
  He said the fact that the two countries had had a 
confrontational past had not overwhelmed their desire for good 
neighbourliness and co-operation. The agreement was a key to 
more co-operation agreements. 
  Both ministers said a formal non-aggression pact had not 
been 
signed because it was unnecessary. 
  According to the agreement, all functions and duties at the 
military base and Rooikop airport will be handed over by the 
South African Defence Force [SADF] to the Namibian Defence Force 
[NDF] and to the Directorate of Civil Aviation on February 28. 
  It was specifically agreed that the SADF would: 

  -  leave shooting range boundaries and markers intact; 
  -  brief and train appointed members of the NDF in the 
protection, 
use and application of the shooting range; 
  -  hand over safety templates to the NDF; 
  -  donate and transfer to the NDF all furniture, kitchen 
equipment, garden tools, camping equipment, linen and 
labour-saving utensils in present use at the base and valued at 
about R440,000; 
  -  transfer telecommunication equipment at the command and 
control 
centre at the base, valued at about R510,000; 
  -  transfer all flying-related equipment and existing aids 
rendering the airport international and valued at R5.5 million. 

    Namibia has granted overflight and landing rights at Rooikop 
airport to enable South African military aircraft to undertake 
humanitarian missions. 
  South Africa will assist with search and rescue services 
until Namibia can take over these responsibilities.

  [Text] The strike by Posts and Telecommunication workers in 
Zimbabwe has crumbled. It was called to protest over a pay 
award the workers didn't get because the government took it to 
court. The government hit back by warning the strikers that 
they will be dismissed, and arresting a number of union leaders. 
The union, itself struggling financially backed off, but not 
all the workers have heeded the call to go back. From Harare, 
Rachel Rawlings reports: 
  [Begin Rawlings recording] Eight senior members of the union 
were picked up in the early hours of this morning and taken to 
Harare Central Police Station for questioning. They were told 
they had contravened the law and order maintenance act by 
inciting a strike in an essential service where strike action is 
forbidden. But union officials said this afternoon the strike 
was called because the existence of the union itself was under 
immediate threat, and strike action in such circumstances was 
allowed under the Labor Relations Act. 
  Union President (Wilfred Chanaiwa) said the management of 
the 
Post and Telecommunications Corporation, PTC, seem to be trying 
to destroy the union by interfering with the collection of 
subscriptions and harassing union officers. The PTC is 
challenging in the Supreme Court a Labor Tribunal ruling giving 
workers a 12.5 percent pay increase. According to Mr. 
(Chanaiwa), if union subscriptions aren't collected in full, 
they won't be able to hire a lawyer or even pay their own phone 
bills. After a meeting this morning at the Ministry of Labor, 
union officials called off the strike because of a threat by 
Minister John Nkomo to issue an immediate disposal order which 
would suspend the union and get the PTC the right to sack all 
union members. 
  Instructions to return to work were broadcast on the radio 
this afternoon, but certainly in Harare went unheeded. The 
capital's central post office, usually extremely crowded and 
busy, was deserted, and canvass bags covered the unemptied 
letter boxes. Representatives of the union and PTC management 
are due to meet tomorrow with officials from the Ministry of 
Labor to address the union's grievances. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Accra, 17 Feb (GNA/PANA) -- About 1,000 corpses 
have been buried by security agencies in the ethnic violence in 
northern Ghana, a senior military officer said on Wednesday [16 
February]. Brig. Joseph Henry Smith, commander of security 
operations in northern Ghana told a press conference in Tamale, 
about 405 miles north of Accra, that security agencies were 
searching for more bodies. He said the military was gradually 
taking control of the situation and has started disarming the 
warring factions. 
  Brig. Smith said more than 2,000 shot guns have been seized. 
He said the number of deaths cannot be estimated because many 
people who have been killed in the bush or have died in their 
rooms when their villages were burned were yet to be found. 
Brig. Smith said a national emergency committee under the 
chairmanship of the minister of defence, Mahama Iddrisu, has 
been established to bring the ethnic fighting in the region 
under control. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The Liberian peace agreement appears to be back on 
track. The country's three main parties have agreed that on 7 
March they will install a new transitional council to run the 
country. The disarmament process will also begin on that same 
day. In addition a date has been set for multiparty elections 
in Liberia, 7 September. The three component parties in the 
agreement are the Interim Government led by Dr. Amos Sawyer, the 
National Patriotic Front of Liberia, NPFL, led by Charles 
Taylor, and the ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy 
in Liberia] militia. 
  The coordinator of the peace process there is the United 
Nations special representative in Liberia, Mr. Trevor Gordon 
Somers. On the line to Monrovia, Fergus Nico asked him how he 
felt about the latest agreement: 
  [Begin recording] [Somers] We reached agreement very early 
this morning-- somewhere around 1 o'clock, 1:15 in the morning-- 
after slogging away all day, so that this has brought the 
satisfaction that after hard work the parties were able to reach 
an agreement. I think it is a good effort on the part of the 
Liberians. The three parties have demonstrated despite the 
difficulties that they had faced in reaching certain aspects of 
the agreement, they had (?certainly) taken the kind of decision, 
for example, that they have named a date for the installation of 
their government. As you know the Liberian people have yearned 
for that forsome time. And I think that is the most important 
thing that the parties could have done. 
  [Nico] Well, let us look ahead to that-- the 7 March, the 
installation of their transitional power sharing council. What 
kind of distribution of portfolios do you think [word 
indistinct] between the parties? 
  [Somers] At present, you know the parties have managed to 
distribute 13 of the 17 cabinet posts. The four on which they 
have not reached an agreement are defense, finance, justice, and 
foreign affairs. And of the other 13, it is a fairly even 
distribution among the three parties. 
  [Nico] But the other four are the most critical portfolios, 
are they not? 
  [Somers] That is correct, that is correct. But I am 
satisfied that they will continue to work to find a solution to 
that problem before we get to the 7th. There will be a lot of 
maneuvering, there will be a lot of discussions. 
  [Nico] Can we just turn to the other aspect of what seems to 
have been the main success from the early hours of this morning 
-- the question of disarmament? There's always been this 
question of whether disarmament should start before the talking 
or vice versa. Now you seem to have secured agreement that they 
will start at the same time. Do you think really we will see 
your troops beginning to collect significant number of weapons? 
  [Somers] The plan is that within approximately three-week 
period, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Peace- 
Monitoring Group] and the UN military observers will be fully 
deployed throughout the country. Once they are fully deployed 
then we are ready to lift the arms. And at the moment we start 
the lifting of arms, that is the moment that the government 
should (?be seated). And I think the act of disarmament itself 
is one that will (?roll) fairly quickly, because the various 
factions will bring their fighters to points, where they will 
then be moved to encampment centers. And I think this is a kind 
of thing that will (?rush through) once we get started with the 
arm lifting. 
  [Nico] Is it correct to say the Ugandans and Tanzanians will 
be ready to go? No word yet on the Zimbabwean contingent? 
  [Somers] The Tanzanians and Ugandans are already in their 
(?forward) positions, ready to go. The Zimbabweans, we now have 
reached the point where we are just checking with the Americans 
to determine whether sufficient resources are in hand for the 
Zimbabweans to come and stream as soon as we get the green 
light. [end recording]

  [Text] Togolese President General Gnassingbe Eyadema flew 
in to Abuja today for talks with Nigeria's head of state, 
General Sani Abacha. As they settled down to bilateral talks, 
Gen. Abacha remarked that economic development and security in 
the West African subregion and Africa in general are best 
guaranteed by the cooperation of the African countries, but in 
the framework of groupings like the ECOWAS [Economic Community 
of West African States] and the OAU. State House correspondent 
Chris Ngu reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ngu] Gen. Abacha's opening speech at the 
bilateral talks was dominated by two themes: peace and economic 
development in the West African subregion. He told the Togolese 
delegation led by President Gnassingbe Eyadema that the pursuit 
of happiness for the people of both countries should be the 
cornerstone of leadership responsibility. He said that in the 
face of current economic and security problems in West Africa 
and developments in the world, subregional and regional 
cooperation of African countries becomes imperative. Gen. 
Abacha, however, noted that peace and economic development 
cannot be achieved in an atmosphere of strife and discord. He 
commended President Eyadema for what he referred to as the 
president's peace effort in Liberia, adding that peace efforts 
in Liberia should not be given up. 
  [Abacha] I believe our resolve under ECOWAS which formed the 
basis of establishing ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] -- as a vehicle for establishing peace and security of 
the Liberian people, as a vehicle to which democratic forces 
will emerge in that country -- has to be pursued to its logical 
conclusion. The conflict in Liberia should not be allowed to 
continue forever. 
  [Ngu] On relations between the two countries, he hoped that 
President Eyadema's visit will strengthen relations between Togo 
and Nigeria. President Eyadema, on his part, agreed with Gen. 
Abacha on the need for the warring factions in the Liberian 
crisis to work for peace. He said that no businessman, local or 
international, will like to invest in a country where peace and 
security cannot be guaranteed. President Eyadema said Nigeria's 
ECOMOG initiative is a fine example of a country that believes 
in peace and security of the subregion. 
  Turning to the West African economy, he called for an 
emergency meeting to discuss global issues facing the subregion. 
A situation in which raw materials and export commodities from 
the West African countries continue to attract low prices and 
marked by depreciating national currencies should not be allowed 
continue. Delegations of the two countries went into a 
closed-door session. President Eyadema and his team, who flew 
in today, have left the country. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, 17 Feb (PANA) -- Detained Nigerian Maj.-Gen. 
Shehu Musa Yar'adua was freed on Wednesday [16 February], but a 
suit against his detention is going ahead in a Kaduna high court 
in northern Nigeria. 
  Yar'adua, who was number two in the 1976-79 military 
government of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, was arrested last weekend 
in his home town of Kaduna, on his return from a foreign trip. 
There has not been any official statement on his detention, 
believed to be connected with his press conference 12 January in 
Lagos, asking the Gen. Sani Abacha government to hand over power 
by December this year. In a veiled reference to that press 
conference, the police in Lagos on 13 January, warned 
politicians against making "inflammatory" statements. 
  A Kaduna high court began hearing the case against the 
government on Wednesday apparently unaware of the general's 
release. Yar'adua's lawyer called the detention "unlawful, 
illegal and unconstitutional." 
  Judge Yemi Ibiyeye had refused to grant bail to Yar'adua 
saying it would amount to injustice to release him on bail 
without hearing from the government. The judge ordered the 
government to be served with a motion on notice and fixed 
hearing of the case for 28 February. It was unclear what would 
become of the case. 
  Yar'adua, pressed for comments by journalists on Wednesday, 
said he would issue a press statement soon. His arrest had 
provoked condemnation by human rights and pro-democracy groups.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Senegalese capital Dakar yesterday witnessed 
some of the most violent scenes it has ever seen. After a 
meeting was dispersed by police, demonstrators took to the 
streets. There were clashes and a number of policemen were 
killed, apparently murdered. A civilian also died. On the 
line, Jeremy Skeet asked our Dakar correspondent, Djadje Ba, 
what the situation was today. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Skeet] Are the 
government saying that any one particular opposition party is 
behind these demonstrations? 
  [Ba] Well, according to an official communique read today on 
the national radio, an Islamic group called the (Mushashidin wa 
al-Mushashidadi), which means in Arabic Youth, Young [Men] and 
Women following the truth, is banned starting from today in the 
territory of Senegal. It seems that from the government's point 
of view now, according to observers here, the people who were 
behind yesterday's demonstrations are definitely the 
(Mushashidin wa al-Mushashidadi). 
  [Skeet] Now, that's the government's version. You were on 
the streets yesterday. Do you think the demonstrators only 
belong to this Islamic party or do you think they came from 
other opposition parties? 
  [Ba] Personally, I have heard yesterday among demonstrators 
some young people chanting Islamic slogans in which they were 
saying that well, all the hardship is due to the ruling party 
and that they wanted to get rid of the current government. 
Well, this is one thing. Another thing, there were also some 
other youngsters who were saying that they were simply in the 
streets, simply because they are tired once again of the 
economic hardship. They don't belong to any of the parties here 
in Senegal but are simply Senegalese who want a better life and 
were on the streets because they wanted to live better. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Address by Interior Minister Djibo Ka on 17 February; place </F>
not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [passage indistinct] on Wednesday 16 February 1994 
in the city of Dakar and its suburbs. Indeed, violent 
demonstrations were organized by people armed with cutlasses, 
knives, sticks, cutting and thrusting weapons, and even 
(?pistols). This occurred at a time when an authorized rally of 
opposition parties grouped within an undeclared body -- the 
coordinating committee of the democratic forces -- was taking 
place [words indistinct] when the said demonstrations started in 
several areas of the city [words indistinct]. This rally, which 
was also attended by officials and members of [words indistinct] 
which is neither declared nor registered, and therefore an 
illegal movement, was an opportunity for the organizers to 
incite people to the violence that marked the events we 
witnessed yesterday afternoon in the central part of Dakar and 
its suburb. 
  The security forces, the police, the gendarmerie, and the 
National Army, with the support of the fire department, 
demonstrated courage and determination to restore and maintain 
public order, which was under serious challenge, and to ensure 
the safety of goods and property [words indistinct]. The 
balance sheet of the demonstrations is [words indistinct]. The 
demonstrators showed their desire to destroy everything in their 
way. As I speak to you, several seriously injured persons have 
been admitted to various hospitals in Dakar. They are all 
members of the public security forces. On behalf of the 
president of the Republic, the government, and all of you, I pay 
my respects to those who died in carrying out their sacred duty, 
that of ensuring our security and our tranquillity. The head of 
state has decided that they should be decorated as knights of 
the national Order of the Lion. They are: Moustapha Diane, 
warrant officer; Ibrahima Said, policeman; Dauda Ndour, police 
sergeant; and Abou Han, policeman; and El Hadj Soubou Tek, 
warrant officer. 
  On behalf of the head of state and the government, I would 
like to (?state) that the families of these policemen who died 
on active service will not be forgotten. One demonstrator who 
has yet to be identified is also [words indistinct]. More than 
30 demonstrators were arrested and are being interrogated. The 
initial results of these investigations have shown precisely who 
were the instigators and the perpetrators of these criminal acts 
of vandalism which the government has already condemned. 
Indeed, it was a plan cleverly designed to sow terror, 
demoralize the security forces, destroy property acquired by 
peaceful citizens, and, in culmination, try to destabilize the 
democratic institutions which the Senegalese people [words 
indistinct]. 
  This is why we have every reason to consider the instigators 
of this plan and those who have carried it out as the declared 
adversaries of the democratic and law-abiding state, which 
guarantees liberties and human rights. The instigators and 
perpetrators of the criminal acts that occurred yesterday 
afternoon have decided to engage in trying to destroy the 
time-consuming work patiently done by the Senegalese people, 
particularly the democratic forces which they make up and which 
are symbolized today by a democratic and secular republic. 
  What I would like to say this evening on behalf of the 
government, first of all to the instigators and perpetrators of 
the disturbances, is that their plan is henceforth known (?at 
least by the security forces), who have been ordered to continue 
to carry out their sacred mission with the greatest firmness and 
unflinching determination. The government will spare no efforts 
in strengthening the means of action, intervention, and search 
of our security forces, whose courage and patriotism should be 
(?lauded). Thus, they will continue to carry out their duty at 
the service of the nation with all necessary efficiency. I also 
solemnly reaffirm to you, dear compatriots, and to each family 
the government's determination to assume all its 
responsibilities, by ensuring your individual and collective 
security as well as the free movement of people and the 
protection of (?property). 
  To this end, all the appropriate measures were taken 
yesterday evening -- I mean during the night -- (?to 
consolidate) [words indistinct] banning all activities 
throughout the country of the illicit and illegal movement of 
(Mushashidin Wal Mushashidadi). [words indistinct]. 
Instructions have been given to the administrative authorities 
to close immediately all (?centers) usually used by this 
movement for meetings [words indistinct] which are banned 
throughout the country, pending the result of the legal action 
initiated against its (?members). 
  Other similar measures will certainly be taken in the coming 
hours to render harmless those who seek to undermine the 
foundation of our political system, which is the collective work 
of the democrats and those who profoundly believe in the values 
of tolerance and peace. Together, that is the people and each 
of (?you) -- you who only aspire to live in peace in a united 
country, profoundly committed to freedom -- and the authorities, 
we will act, as societies with democratic political systems know 
how to do, by trusting our institutions. 
  Finally and on behalf of the government, I would like to 
reaffirm our desire and our resolute determination to have the 
state's authority respected. This state will assume all its 
functions with more firmness and vigor, particularly the 
security of people and goods, of which it is the guarantor. In 
this regard, I am convinced that the state can count on the 
patriotic mobilization and commitment of citizens yearning for 
peace, justice, and freedom so that Senegal, our country, 
remains the democratic country respected by the world -- a 
country whose legal character is symbolized by the law-abiding 
state that we have built within the framework of a strong nation 
of solidarity. I thank you for your kind attention.

  [Text] Dakar, 17 Feb (AFP) -- Today, the opposition 
Coordination of Democratic Forces [CFD] shifted the blame on the 
Senegalese Government for the violent demonstrations that took 
place here yesterday and that resulted in five dead, including 
four policemen. In a communique issued here, the CFD accused 
the Senegalese Government of "provoking" opposition activists by 
barricading access routes to a public meeting and authorizing 
the security forces to use force against those who wanted to go 
there. 
  The CFD, which comprises five opposition parties, including 
the main opposition party -- Abdoulaye Wade's Senegalese 
Democratic Party -- expressed support for "the spontaneous 
decision by the masses to organize a protest march yesterday 
against the unspeakable and unjustified violations of the most 
basic freedom." 
  The demonstrations broke out after a public meeting 
organized 
by the opposition parties to condemn the negative effects of the 
11 January 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc on the 
people's standard of living. During the demonstrations, 
hundreds of youth swarmed into the city center, ransacking 
everything in their way and attacking the security forces who 
tried to contain them with teargas grenades.

  [Text] In Togo, the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], 
which had decided to suspend its participation in the second 
round of the legislative elections, has finally rescinded its 
decision. Several differences seem to have been settled. Yaovi 
Agboyibor's CAR has reportedly received concrete assurances from 
the government concerning its candidates in the second round of 
the legislative elections in Togo. Our correspondent in Lome, 
Olabire da Cruz, has the details. 
  [Begin da Cruz recording] There are no more obstacles to the 
continuation of the electoral process. Yaovi Agboyibor's CAR, 
which decided on 15 February to suspend its participation in the 
electoral campaign in order to obtain security guarantees for 
its candidates, has lifted the suspension order, so the second 
round of the legislative elections will certainly take place on 
20 February. Out of the 22 parties, which entered the race at 
the beginning of the elections, five have qualified for the 
second round. 
  The CAR's decision to lift the suspension order follows the 
mediation of the International Monitoring Committee, which after 
meeting with President Eyadema, received a number of guarantees 
from him to ensure the success of the electoral process. One of 
these guarantees is that only civilian and military observers 
will be deployed, as a priority, to the 11 electoral 
constituencies where the Rally of the Togolese People and the 
opposition parties -- CAR and Togolese Union for Democracy -- 
are in a tie. 
  The head of state also agreed to put an end to the 
interference of soldiers in the electoral campaign. Steps will 
be taken to make soldiers aware of their neutrality. As if to 
demonstrate good faith, a commander of the Reconciliation and 
Security Operation Force 93, accused of partiality, will be 
transferred. Also, technical measures will be taken in the 
seventh electoral constituency in Lome to avoid the fraudulent 
use of some 1,000 voters' cards which disappeared a few days ago. 
  In short, the second round of the legislative elections, to 
elect the 24 deputies to add up to the 57 who were elected in 
the first round, will take place on 20 February. The electoral 
campaign will end at midnight tomorrow. Concerning land 
borders, those on the east and north have closed since midnight, 
while the western border has remained closed since 5 January.

  [Text] The International Monitoring Committee [CIS] has 
asked that measures be taken to ensure people's security during 
the 20 February election and the president has agreed. Civilian 
and military observers are to be deployed in sufficient numbers 
in the concerned constituencies for the second round of 
election. This was disclosed to the media today by the CIS 
chairman, Mr. Hermann Yameogo, who led his organization's 
delegation to a meeting with President Eyadema in Lome II. Mr. 
Yameogo regretted the assassination three days ago of a deputy 
from the Action Committee for Renewal party. Hermann Yameogo 
gives more details: 
  [Begin Yameogo recording] You are well aware of the fact 
that 
Togo has experienced tragic and painful events. The CIS took 
the opportunity to express the emotions felt following this 
tragic event. We came to hold talks with the head of state and 
tell him that we were deeply moved by that incident, because it 
tarnished a process that had gone smoothly during the first 
round of legislative elections. The head of state also 
expressed sorrow over these painful incidents. With his 
agreement, we decided to take all necessary measures to ensure 
security during the second round. In this regard, some very 
precise technical measures were agreed on and we will inform the 
opposition accordingly. 
  As for voter's cards, you know that the disappearance of 
some 
cards was reported in the Lome area. President Eyadema said 
that all efforts should be made to take technical measures that 
will prevent any fraud that at the end would be the (?loss) 
[words indistinct]. The head of state also agreed that all 
efforts should be made -- especially in the constituencies where 
opposition and government candidates are running neck and neck 
-- the [words indistinct] in order to make people feel more 
secure. It was decided to emphasize the security issue to 
reassure the opposition and enable them to go to the polls with 
greater confidence. This is in substance what has been decided 
with the consent of President Eyadema. In sum, security 
measures should be reinforced. Therefore precise technical 
measures were taken and we will inform the opposition in due 
course. We insisted we would like to see observers be properly 
deployed and find technical solutions to the disappearance of 
voter's cards. [end recording] 
  The discussions between President Gnassingbe Eyadema and the 
members of the CIS also tackled the issue of the neutrality to 
be observed by the elements of Force 93. More from Mr. Yameogo: 
  [Begin recording] [Yameogo] I would also like to stress the 
fact that President Eyadema agreed with the CIS to remind Force 
93 of its duty to remain neutral. It did so in the past and 
must continue thus to reassure people. This force is there and 
will assure the security of all. It is not there to influence 
the voters. It will play its role throughout the national 
territory. This decision was accepted by the CIS. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think that the measures 
you just talked about will bring opposition candidates, who have 
said they would not participate in the campaign, back into the 
race? 
  [Yameogo] It should be said that -- just like the last time 
we held talks -- there was also some good will on the side of 
the opposition and it has never refused our suggestions. We 
believe that the measures that were taken this morning will 
reinforce security. We will meet members of the opposition and 
brief them on what the head of state said, and we do not doubt 
that there will good will on both sides. The most important 
thing here is the interest of Togo and it is essential that the 
legislative elections take place and that all factions are given 
guarantees to go to the polls. We think things look good. [end
