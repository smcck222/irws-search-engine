  [Text] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today said 
that he does not intend to enter or be involved in any 
controversy regarding his statement at the Kericho agricultural 
show. In a statement issued at State House, Nairobi, President 
Moi said his attention has been drawn to the gross distortion 
and misinterpretation by the FORD [Forum for the Restoration of 
Democracy]-Kenya Luo members of parliament concerning his 
statement in Kericho severing relations between their political 
party and KANU [Kenya African National Union]. 
  However, his excellency the president noted that he wants to 
make it abundantly clear that he only announced the severing of 
the relations between the two political parties--that is, KANU 
and FORD-Kenya--in his capacity as the president of KANU. The 
president further pointed out that his reference to the 
Kipsigis, Maasai, and Kuria was within the context of 
cooperation in stamping out cattle rustling among themselves and 
had nothing to do with party politics. The head of state, 
therefore, said the claim by the Luo members of parliament that 
this move was meant to isolate the Luo community has no basis 
whatsoever unless they want to make the world believe that 
FORD-Kenya is a party exclusively for the Luo. 
  President Moi pointed out that he had so far thought that 
FORD-Kenya was a national party with a countrywide following, 
but said it was now interesting to note that the Luo members of 
parliament consider FORD-Kenya as being synonymous with their 
community. The president said as far as he is concerned, this 
perception is entirely their own and not a corcect reflection of 
his statement, which was at party level and had nothing to do 
with ethnic communities. 
  He also observed that he would like to believe that the 
highly insolent, inflammatory, and provocative utterances by a 
FORD-Kenya member of parliament, James Orengo, during the burial 
of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga were made on behalf of FORD-Kenya and 
not on behalf of the entire Luo community. 
  His excellency the president noted that as a nationalist who 
sees tribalism as a cancer, his intention is to strengthen KANU 
in Nyanza in order to hasten the peace of development in the 
area. The KANU government, he added, has initiated ambitious 
development projects in that region covering all sectors, but 
also intends to increase them in order to serve more effectively 
the rising population.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Representatives of the MPLA [Popular Movement for 
the Liberation of Angola] and UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] in Lusaka have agreed on a formula 
for pursuing national reconciliation. They have signed a 
document which dictates the spirit of peace, forgive and forget 
the past, and an amnesty for all who committed crimes during the 
civil war. The document also guarantees a role for UNITA in a 
future Angolan administration. Carolyn Dempster called up 
UNITA's chief negotiator in Lusaka, Jorge Valentim. She asked 
him how significant this new agreement is: 
  [Begin recording] [Valentim] Indeed, this subject of 
national 
reconciliation is very difficult and very complex, but we 
succeeded to adopt the general principle because there is a 
political willingness on the two sides, and also we must be very 
thankful to the mediation, to the observers who helped us to put 
down important principles that can reconcile, (?really), Angola. 
  [Dempster] How soon are we likely to see the implementation 
of some of these principles? 
  [Valentim] The two sides accept that the reconciliation is 
not a matter between institutions, it is a matter between 
Angolans to work together for common goals with the spirit of 
cooperation. Also it is important that we accepted that all 
violence should be condemned, every conflict should be solved 
peacefully, and also the two sides accept that the UNITA 
elements should participate fully in all levels of 
administration, political institutions, economic and other 
institutions. 
  [Dempster] Mr. Valentim, (?a lot of) people looking at this 
would say, but what right does UNITA have to participate in a 
future government in Angola? After all you lost the democratic 
elections and the war that was waged was very much taken up by 
your leader, Jonas Savimbi. 
  [Valentim] Yes, I want to say that we are the Angolans, we 
learn from history, from civil war in the United States, from 
other wars, that the most important is political willingness, 
and we are ready to finish the war. The voice that we will 
listen will be the voice of Angolans, they want (?really) the 
Angolans to live together. That is why we are ready to 
cooperate, to build up a new nation. 
  [Dempster] Mr. Valentim, this sounds like very noble 
statements, but at the same time as you are making them and 
reaching some kind of agreement across the table on 
reconciliation the fighting is continuing, and if anything, 
intensifying. Now, what hope is there of reaching a point of a 
cease-fire in the near future? 
  [Valentim] We are insisting every day to the mediation and 
observers to do everything possible to appeal to the two sides 
to stop the war in order that we should have real good 
environment, political environment for discussions. The two 
delegations, they don't agree to escalate the war in Angola, and 
the relationship between the two delegations is excellent. I 
want to say it clearly that we hope, with appeal of the Security 
Council and with the appeal made by President Clinton from the 
White House, our leadership in Huambo and Luanda, they will 
listen to the voice of reason in order to put down all this 
escalation of war in order to have peace in Angola. 
  [Dempster] So, you are saying that the political discussion 
has to be finished before there is a cease-fire, or you are 
hoping that there will be a cease-fire before you in fact finish 
negotiations? 
  [Valentim] Well, if it was my wish, it is really now to have 
de facto cease-fire before finishing all the political debate, 
no matter that it was agreed before in December that a formal 
cease- fire should only be declared after we finish all issues. 
But the personal willing of the UNITA delegation is that the 
fighting now should be completely finished with a de facto 
cease-fire on the two sides. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by J.B. Akrou] </F>
  [Text] Hamed Bakayoko, publishing editor of LE PATRIOTE 
newspaper and managing director of Radio-Nostalgie, has been 
arrested and placed under police custody for an offense against 
the head of state. It is especially in his capacity as 
publishing editor of LE PATRIOTE that he was arrested and placed 
under custody. LE PATRIOTE, which was initially created to 
defend the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire [PDCI] and the 
republican institutions, and whose slogan is, "restoring 
the terror balance", was meant to serve as a combat 
newspaper, attacking the opposition and its leaders at will. 
  Unfortunately, at some point this newspaper chose, 
inordinately, to take the side of former Prime Minister Alassane 
Dramane Ouattara against Henri Konan Bedie, who was then speaker 
of the National Assembly, and PDCI Secretary General Laurent 
Dona-Fologo. Singularly virulent remarks were published in the 
columns of LE PATRIOTE against them. When Mr. Bedie succeeded 
late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, LE PATRIOTE, in articles 
in each of its issues by its publishing editor and reporters or 
readers' letters, made offending, unkind, and even slanderous 
remarks against government members and the head of state. Ahmed 
Bakayoko clearly indicated in an editorial in December his 
intention to continue "the struggle," which was a way of saying 
that he would fight the new Ivorian leaders. 
  Since then, he has not shown any restraint and has become 
particularly famous for the "letter to the brothers" 
of Kong, which appeared in Issue No. 93 of PATRIOTE EXPRESS in 
which President Bedie was insulted and called a 
"midget".... By so doing, he ignored the Press Law 
voted on 27 December 1991 which makes punishable by law 
"any flagrant insult and offense" committed against 
the head of state, and even the Ivorian Penal Code, which any 
citizen worthy of that name is obliged to respect.

<F P=106> [Government news release issued in Bangui on 17 February; </F>
read by Foreign Ministry spokesman Pierre-Benjamin Ngregaye] 
  [Text] To our great surprise, we learned on the radio that 
the Central African Republic [CAR] allegedly allows weapons 
belonging to the Sudanese Government's Army to cross its 
territory, weapons that are said to be used to fight the Sudan 
People's Liberation Army, SPLA. On 8 December 1993, the CAR 
Government received a Sudanese Government delegation that had 
come to request the CAR's help in resolving the Sudanese 
problem. Sympathetic to this laudable request, the CAR 
Government told the Sudanese delegation that the CAR 
Government's priority was, first of all, to resolve the Chadian 
problem in the southern part of this sister country. 
Furthermore, the government reaffirmed its desire to make its 
modest contribution -- in consultation with other African 
countries -- to helping the brotherly Sudanese people settle 
their tragedy. 
  The CAR Government, which was democratically elected at the 
ballot box, favors dialogue and consultation. It has refused, 
now refuses, and will always refuse to allow that its territory 
be used to destabilize any brotherly neighboring country. 
Therefore, faithful to its democratic tradition, the CAR 
Government will unreservedly help protect the Sudanese refugees 
currently living on its territory and also those from southern 
Chad. At the moment, the CAR is proud to be hosting peace 
negotiations between delegations from the Chadian Government and 
its armed opponents operating in the southern part of Chad. The 
CAR would also be proud to be available when the time comes to 
help the Sudanese brothers achieve reconciliation. 
  Issued in Bangui on 17 February 1994 
  Signed: Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Charge of Relations 
With French-Speaking Countries 
  [The same cast later notes that "Professor Simon 
Bedaya-Ngaro, minister of foreign affairs in charge of relations 
with French- speaking countries, this morning received His 
Excellency al-Tijani Salih Fadayl, Sudan's ambassador to the 
CAR. Their discussions centered on ways and means of 
strengthening bilateral bonds of friendship and cooperation."]

  [Text] Brazzaville, 16 Feb (PANA) -- An Israeli company is 
to train Congo's special forces and the president's security 
guards, the Congolese interior minister, Martin Mberri, 
confirmed on Wednesday [16 February]. He told a press 
conference in Brazzaville that the government and the Israeli 
company, which he declined to identify, had signed an accord for 
the training. Mberri said the Israeli experts were already in 
Congo. He said the Israeli experts, who are already in the 
central African country, will "help the Congolese public force 
adapt to the new demands of democracy." 
  The Israeli press recently reported that the Brazzaville 
government had signed an agreement with an Israeli firm, 
"Levdan," specializing in the sale of arms. The Israeli Defence 
Ministry, it said, gave its approval for the conclusion of the 
50 million-dollar contract which also includes the training of 
senior officers in the Congolese Army. 
  In a statement issued on Sunday in Brazzaville, the 
Congolese 
opposition described the accord as "criminal" and a waste of 
money. The 30 billion CFA contract sum as given by Israeli 
sources, the opposition said, was two years pay for 8,000 
workers that the government is about to lay off. It said the 
accord also "conflicts with the dynamics of peace initiated in 
Congo". 
  The opposition warned the government against the 
"consequences on the foreign community, especially whites, 
because of the confusion which would be generated by a popular 
resistance against repression." However, Mberri defended the 
accord saying the government took "a special credit" for the 
programme. "The agreement is normal. It will allow the public 
force to have new aptitudes and promptly respond to the new 
forms of contest," Mberri said, stressing that the Armed Forces 
and police have not succeeded in ending recent ethnic clashes. 
Mberri revealed that other countries, like France, had agreed 
to train and assist the Congolese Army, Gendarmerie and police. 
He said that the government was planning "to revitalise the 
ageing Army and police cadres." 
  On the deployment of a buffer force in the quarters of 
south-west Brazzaville which have been the areas of factional 
fighting, the minister said it would be deployed on Sunday, 
after delays due to technical, logistic and financial problems.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, </F>
Cameroonian UN enovy to Rwanda, by Marie-France Cros in Kigali 
on 15 February: "Rwanda: United Nations Issues Serious Warning"] 
  [Text] The UN representative expressed his irritation to LA 
LIBRE BELGIQUE. Could this mean the premature return of the 
Belgian UN troops? 
  "We have practically returned to square one," said the 
Cameroonian UN envoy to Rwanda, Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, who 
seemed rather disheartened on Tuesday [15 February] night when 
we interviewed him by telephone in Kigali. With MINUAR [UN 
Mission for the Assistance of Rwanda], he is in charge of 
ensuring that the peace agreement signed in Arusha in August 
1993 is applied. 
  However, the establishment of the transitional institutions 
provided for in the agreement has already suffered a 45-day 
delay. This Monday, the swearing-in ceremony had to be canceled 
once again. The former single party, the MNRD [National 
Revolutionary Movement for Development], "which subordinated its 
involvement to that of the Liberal Party [PL]" -- the opposition 
force now divided into those supporting and those against 
President Habyarimana, who cannot agree on which of them will 
have seats [in the institutions] -- "has not lifted its 
reservations." Consequently, neither the MNRD, nor the 
president, who supported this reservation, would have come 
because the PL was not there. Not to mention the fact that the 
MDR [Republican Democratic Movement] is getting bogged down in 
the legal procedures" associated with a dispute similar to that 
dogging the PL. 
  According to Booh Booh, "one of the elements that is 
complicating matters is the draft version of an official 
declaration of the parties presented by the MNRD to suspend 
their conduct during the transition period." The text proposes 
an amnesty for all those crimes committed up to the signing of 
the peace agreement "and only to proceed with nominations to the 
administration, legal authorities, and army on the basis of a 
consensus. Some objections are already making the rounds, e.g., 
the draft declaration by the MNRD is not in line with the peace 
agreement, which provides for the replacement of those 
individuals who were corrupt, incompetent, or involved in 
massacres. If a consensus has to be reached each time, then 
there will no doubt be few changes made," Booh Booh explained. 
The parties have to state their position on the MNRD proposal 
on Wednesday. However, there was little hope in Kigali on 
Tuesday evening. And time marches on. 
  "The resolution that created MINUAR and the resolution 
adopted on 6 January are quite clear," Booh Booh stressed. "If 
no progress is made in the application of the Arusha peace plan, 
then the United Nations will not continue its support. The 
operation is costing $700,000 per day. This is a serious 
warning. It is entirely up to the Rwandans whether or not they 
want to take it seriously."

  [Text] There has been, perhaps, a giant step forward in the 
attempt to find a solution to the crisis in Zaire. At the High 
Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT], the 
transitional constitution commission met at last today at the 
People's Palace. The meeting was expected to help in adopting 
the group's report. It must be noted here that the points of 
disagreement will be submitted to the next plenary session of 
the transitional legislative body for debate. According to 
certain sources, these two agreements are linked to the 
prerogatives of the leaders of the transition and this stalemate 
at the transitional constitution commission should mean the 
imminent convening of the much awaited HCR-PT plenary session. 
  Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo Passigna, however, made an 
important point. The chairman of the HCR-PT recalled that it is 
up to the opposition to name a prime minister. In an interview 
published by the newspaper LA REFERENCE PLUS, Monsignor 
Monsengwo stated, and I quote: It is not for the political 
forces of the conclave to exercise a kind of veto. The problem 
here is that people negotiate badly and change their minds 
later. I feel that we must follow the decision made by the 
troika. According to the Kisangani bishop, under this plan, it 
is for the opposition to name a prime minister. The others, that 
is to say the political forces of the conclave, grant them this 
right on condition that this prime minister forms his government 
on the basis of the principle of balance and fairness, unquote. 
  Another important point is that the next plenary session 
will 
not directly debate the issue of prime minister, Msgr. Monsengwo 
also said. He urged the politicians to make haste so that a 
truly responsible and competent government can be set up to 
control the catastrophic situation in the country. 
  Meanwhile, the scramble for the post of transitional prime 
minister continues. There is, however, a new situation in the 
prospects for the head of the future transitional government. 
If the high council is bent on the prime minister's election, 
this vote must be in the form of secret ballot in which 
everyone, in line with his conscience, will vote for the best 
interests of the nation, declared Kibassa-Maliba, who was cited 
by LE SOFT newspaper. The paper also quoted the Union for 
Democracy and Social Progress leader as saying: Tshisekedi could 
present himself against other candidates. 
  Things could now move more rapidly on the Zairian political 
scene in order to end the crisis that has seriously affected the 
country for many long months.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Albert M'Peti, PDSC Democrat </F>
representative in Belgium, by Rik de Gendt in Antwerp; date not 
given: "Zairian Christian Democrats Support Tshisekedi for Time 
Being"] 
  [Text] Antwerp--"We are doing our utmost to keep Etienne 
Tshisekedi as prime minister. But as a large party, no one can 
prevent us from analyzing the present situation and preparing 
for the future. If the prime minister's position nevertheless 
becomes vacant, we will put forward our own candidate in 
consultation with our partners in the opposition," Albert 
M'Peti, the PDSC [Democratic and Social Christian Party] 
representative in Belgium, said in an interview with DE 
STANDAARD. 
  For some time, things have not been going well between the 
two main partners in the Zairian opposition, the UDPS [Union for 
Democracy and Social Progress] of Prime Minister Tshisekedi and 
Joseph Ileo's PDSC. In the local press and at meetings of party 
activists, the Christian Democrats are being blamed for dropping 
Tshisekedi and even looking to lead the government themselves. 
They would prefer to put forward their deputy chairman Gustave 
Malumba Mbangula. 
  The UDPS leader made it clear again yesterday that he is not 
planning to step down. He called the politicians who claim the 
prime ministership "an insult to the intelligence of the Zairian 
people" and emphasized expressly that "the prime minister's 
position is not empty." 
  "We also think that," M'Peti replied. "We continue to 
support Tshisekedi. But should things have another outcome, 
then we will put forward our own candidate, fully in accordance 
with the wishes and decisions of the CNS [Sovereign National 
Conference] and the HCR/PT [High Council of the 
Republic/Transitional Parliament]. 
  This stipulates that the prime minister of the new 
transitional government must come from the opposition and that 
he will be free to form his own government. In important 
portfolios like home and foreign affairs, defense and energy, 
each opposition minister will be given a deputy minister from 
presidential circles and vice versa. 
  This week a full meeting of the HCR/PT is to assess the 
results of various committees. As soon as the new transitional 
constitution is approved, the high meeting must appoint a new 
prime minister. The government program remains that which was 
drawn up by the CNS in the past. It first provides for a 
referendum on the new constitution and free parliamentary and 
presidential elections within 15 months.

  [Text] There is trouble between Cameroon and Nigeria. A 
Cameroon Government communique issued yesterday confirmed the 
clashes between Cameroonian and Nigerian forces on the Bakassi 
peninsular. Casualty figures are not yet known, but the event 
is being taken seriously in Yaounde, the Cameroonian capital. 
Our correspondent Jean Mater Ndi reports from Yaounde. 
  [Begin Ndi recording] It is the first time that the Cameroon 
Government talks about this problem in such a solemn fashion. 
According to the communique, on the night of 18 February a 
detachment of the Nigerian Army launched a series of attacks 
against Cameroonian troops on the Bakassi peninsula in the 
English-speaking south-eastern Cameroon. According to the 
communique, Cameroonian troops responded and pushed back the 
attackers. 
  It should, however, be noted that this incident is just an 
extension of a situation existing since 21 December when 500 
Nigerian soldiers occupied certain areas of Cameroonian 
territory in the Gulf of Guinea. In the face of the negative 
attitude of the Nigerian Government, while remaining vigilant on 
the ground, Cameroon has opted for international arbitration. 
The Yaounde authorities have decided to take the case to the UN 
Security Council, the International Court of Justice at The 
Hague, and an OAU central body for the prevention, management, 
and resolution of conflicts. 
  Cameroon reaffirmed its sovereignty over the Bakassi 
peninsula, citing in its defense the German-British treaty of 11 
March 1913, the rule of intangibility of frontiers decided by 
the referendum of 1961 attaching the former eastern Cameroon to 
the southern part of Cameroon under British trusteeship. The 
government also cited the Mawa Declaration of 1975 demarcating 
the maritime borders between the two countries. [end recording]

  [Text] Yaounde, Feb 20 (AFP) -- Cameroon said Sunday [20 
February] it would appeal to the UN Security Council and the 
International Court of Justice over a long-running border 
dispute with Nigeria, after fresh clashes on the Pakazzi 
Peninsula. 
  Nigerian Army units, which have been occupying parts of the 
peninsula since December 21, launched a fresh attack against 
Cameroon troops on Friday and Saturday, but it was beaten off, 
it said in a statement. 
  The latest incident took place despite the fact that 
Cameroon 
had sent "several high-level missions" to Nigeria to resolve the 
dispute peacefully and talks were still going on, said the 
statement signed by Joseph Owona, secretary-general of the 
presidency. 
  The government was appealing to the UN Security Council, the 
International Court in The Hague and the Organisation of African 
Unity, "to establish our rights against this illegal occupation 
of our territory," it said, arguing that Cameroon's sovereignty 
was supported by international treaties. 
  The country would continue to maintain talks with Nigeria 
and 
"seek a peaceful, just and durable settlement of the issue," the 
statement continued. 
  The Pakazzi Peninsula (known as Bakassi by Nigeria), along 
with the Apani and Diamant Islands occupied by Nigerian soldiers 
since the beginning of the year, lies at the mouth of the Akpa 
Yafe River which marks the boundary between the two countries. 
  The border was never precisely drawn through the peninsula, 
an area of mangroves and swamps where most people make their 
living from fishing, and Nigeria has maintained a claim to the 
territory. 
  Nigeria says Cameroonian incursions have caused the deaths 
and flight of thousands of Nigerians from the region, prompting 
Lagos to deploy troops there. 
  During an earlier period of tension in 1981, France 
threatened to intervene militarily to defend Cameroon against 
Nigerian demands, under the terms of its defence agreement with 
Yaounde. 
  The two countries began border demarcation negotiations 
under 
a joint commission in 1986 but it has never given a final ruling. 
  Over the last 10 days they have been exchanging government 
delegations and on Friday Cameroon's deputy foreign minister, 
Francis Nkwain, handed over a message from President Paul Biya 
to his Nigerian counterpart, General Sani Abacha.

  [Text] The state of alert has again been imposed on the 
Gabonese people, eight days after it was lifted. This measure, 
which bans all public demonstrations, is accompanied by a curfew 
that will be in force from 2200 to 0530. The decision was made 
yesterday at an extraordinary cabinet meeting following violent 
incidents that occurred in Libreville at the beginning of the 
strike launched yesterday by the Gabonese Free Trade Unions 
Federation to demand salary increases after the devaluation of 
the CFA franc. The strike quickly turned into riots. 
Demonstrators of imprecise political or trade union 
affiliations took to the streets, stoning taxis and erecting 
barricades in working class districts. For the Gabonese 
Government, this represents a takeover of the strike action by 
opposition parties. Here are more details with Patrice 
Nziengui, communication minister and government spokesman : 
  [Begin Nziengui recording] The cabinet, while recognizing 
the 
right of trade unions' to go on strike -- a right that is 
essentially aimed at defending workers' rights and industrial 
interests -- deeply regrets the political maneuvers underlying 
these demonstrations. The Gabonese people have witnessed, 
notably in Libreville, the magnitude of the pernicious 
consequences of this political manipulation by the opposition. 
Barricades were erected in various streets of the capital thus 
preventing people from circulating in the city and, consquently, 
preventing Gabonese from going to their work places. Vehicles 
were burned in various areas and public buildings were set on 
fire, notably police stations. People were abducted and detained 
against their will. Violence and all sorts of exactions were 
perpetrated against them. Firearms were used against security 
agents and other citizens. 
  Therefore, in order to put an end to this situation, which 
Gabon does not need because of the negative international and 
national economic and political crisis, the government has 
decided to reestablish the state of warning as of tonight, 21 
February from 2200 to 0530. [end recording] 
  The state of warning includes a number of practical 
dispositions, notably, the imposition of a curfew and the 
restriction of certain liberties. These additional measures are 
given here by Defense Minister Martin-Fidele Magnaga: 
  [Begin Magnaga recording] First, all people who will be 
considered a threat to public order will be arrested. Second, 
restrictions have been placed on certain rights, including 
freedom of gathering and freedom of movement of property and 
people. Theaters, bars, and places of meeting of all sorts are 
ordered closed. Finally, a curfew has been imposed and firm 
directives have been given to the security forces to strictly 
enforce these measures. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Libreville, 22 Feb (AFP) -- Small groups of 
demonstrators set up makeshift roadblocks of tyres and stones in 
working-class districts of the Gabonese capital on Tuesday [22 
February], protesting at the government's ordering a new state 
of alert. 
  The protests came barely a week after the lifting of 
previous 
emergency measures in force since early December. Police 
removed the barricades almost as soon as they were put up. 
Elsewhere in the city traffic was normal, though fewer taxis 
than usual were seen. The previous day, the first of a general 
strike called by public and private sector trade unions, 
demonstrators stoned taxis to make the drivers take part in the 
strike. The unions are calling for pay rises to cope with last 
month's 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc. 
  Opposition party officials said their radio station was 
wrecked in a dawn raid by security forces, but there was no 
immediate confirmation from the government. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] In Rwanda another politician has been 
assassinated. He is Felicien Gatabazi, secretary general of the 
Social Democratic Party, who was killed last night by bullet. 
  This assassination comes at a time when the installation of 
the bodies that will be in charge of governing the country 
during the transitional period begins today. The political 
class in Rwanda has been working on this installation for some 
time now in accordance with the peace accord signed in Arusha, 
Tanzania on 4 August 1993. However, the situation remains tense, 
especially in the capital, Kigali, where demonstrations of 
supporters and opponents of the prime minister of the transition 
period took place on 20 February, leaving several people dead. 
The authorities say they are determined to assume their 
responsibilities, and the various international organizations 
are also trying to find solutions to Rwanda's political 
problems. [passage omitted] 
  [Paris AFP in English at 0757 GMT on 22 February in a 
Kigali-datelined item reports: "Rwandan Public Works and Energy 
Minister Felicien Gatabazi was shot dead here late Monday, hours 
before a transitional ruling body including former rebels was 
due to be set in place, Radio Rwanda reported. Gatabazi, a 
leading member of the opposition Social Democratic Party, was 
killed near his home by hidden gunmen who managed to escape, the 
radio said."]

  [Text] The prime minister, Madame Agathe Uwilingiyamana, 
has asked the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Justice to 
carry out an exhaustive investigation into the acts of 
insecurity perpetrated in Kigali today, so that those 
responsible can be punished in accordance with the laws in 
force: Let us listen to her. 
  [Begin Uwilingiyimana recording] Ladies and gentlemen of 
Rwanda, I deplore the insecurity that prevailed in the town of 
Kigali today following the violence perpetrated by members of 
some political parties that do not want to see the 
implementation of the Arusha Accords. These wrongdoers, from 
those political parties that do not support the return of peace 
in our country, claimed that they aimed to stop a meeting to be 
held by the Republican Democratic Movement. This meeting had 
been authorized, and the security services had been informed in 
order to maintain the security of people and their property. We 
sympathize with those harassed and seriously injured persons, 
whose number is not yet known. My condolences go to all those 
whose family members may have died in these ignominious acts 
perpetrated by the enemies of peace. I call upon the services of 
the Ministry of Justice and those of the Defense Ministry to 
undertake exhaustive investigations into today's events. 
  Ladies and gentlemen of Rwanda, be patient. Only two days 
remain before the establishment of the transitional 
institutions, namely the National Transitional Assembly and the 
broad-based Transitional Assembly. The date which has been 
eagerly awaited by the entire Rwandan people and the entire 
international community is 22 February 1994. Thank you. [end

<F P=106> [By Marie-Goretti Uwibambe] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kigali, 22 Feb (AFP) -- Rwandan politicians 
prepared to set up a transitional administration including 
former rebels on Tuesday [22 February], despite the overnight 
murder of a government minister and street protests against the 
plan. Public Works and Energy Minister Felicien Gatabazi, a 
leading member of the opposition Social Democratic Party, was 
shot dead late Monday, Radio Rwanda reported. 
  Paramilitary police said Gatabazi was assassinated outside 
his home by gunmen waiting nearby. The killers, who have not 
been identified, escaped after the attack. 
  A spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission (UNAMIR) in the 
troubled central African nation declared, however, that the 
inauguration of the transitional government and parliament was 
set to go ahead Tuesday despite the violence. "We are still 
invited (to the ceremonies) at 2:00 P.M. (1200 GMT)," the 
spokesman said. 
  Supporters of political parties opposed to the transition 
plan meanwhile threw up barricades on several of Kigali's main 
thoroughfares, while schools and administrative offices were 
closed. [passage omitted] 
  Violence in the run-up to the new administration saw five 
people killed here on Sunday, "two or three" during an 
opposition demonstration and the others by bandits, according to 
a UNAMIR spokesman. 
  The radio said police had to intervene late Monday to rescue 
around 30 officials seized at the Foreign Ministry during a 
demonstration organised by the Coalition for the Defence of the 
Republic, a group claiming to represent the interests of Hutus. 
The formation of the transitional administration has already 
been delayed three times. 
  Gatabazi, a government minister on two occasions in the 
1980s, returned to office in 1990, and was his party's candidate 
for the post of public works and energy minister in the 
government to be inaugurated Tuesday.

minister, and his delegation at Aidid's Nairobi hotel residence. 
The delegation delivered messages from the Italian prime

Somali organizations should hold roundtable meetings to reach 
agreements on issues concerning Somalia. 
  The chairman thanked the Italian Government for its stance

  [Text] Reports from the main Mogadishu port say a 
disturbance took place at the port following an attempt by 
UNOSOM and its surrogates to impose taxes on cargo goods. The 
confrontation occurred yesterday between Mogadishu Somali 
citizens and UNOSOM mercenaries based at the port. 
  A reporter from Radio Mogadishu Voice of the Great Somali 
People, who witnessed the event, said the people were enraged by 
this foreign provocation. He said the people barricaded all the 
roads leading to the port with burning tires and carried 
placards with slogans expressing their indignation and 
opposition to the so-called taxes imposed on cargo goods at the 
port. Asked by our reporter about the taxation, one of the 
transport owners at the port said UNOSOM was not the country's 
central government and therefore had no right to levy taxes at 
Mogadishu Port, adding that they would prefer to die rather than 
pay taxes to UNOSOM. 
  Our reporter also said he had met some Mogadishu Port 
Corporation Officials, (MPOC), an agency appointed by UNOSOM to 
supervise the port's operations and which is composed of whites 
and pseudo- Somalis. The officials told our reporter that what 
UNOSOM had imposed on the Mogadishu Port was not taxes but a 
GATT tariff. They preferred the GATT tariff to tax, believing 
that Somalis would not interpret this as tax. 
  Whatever you call it -- tax, taxation, tariff, GATT, duty, 
levy and others -- basically they are all the same. The Somali 
people will not allow the invading foreigners to impose any 
types of taxes on them.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Feb (MENA)--'Abdallah al-Tahir, foreign 
relations official of the United Somali Party, has denounced the 
detention of UK experts in any part of Somalia. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, al-Tahir said that the 
holding of 21 experts as hostages reflects the power struggle 
between the militias of Abdirahman Ali, former President of 
northern Somalia, and Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, current president of 
the so-called northern Somalia. 
  Al-Tahir, who is on a visit to Cairo, said that the 
abduction 
is also a result of the widespread frustration in Burco and 
Hargeysa, the two provinces that support secession. The three 
other provinces are opposed to secession, he stated. 
  The Somali official expressed his hope that the United 
Kingdom would withhold its support to the secession following 
this incident and instead help the Somalis emerge united, not 
divided, from the current crisis. 
  Al-Tahir said that he briefed Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and 
Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid on the 
current developments in the country. Egypt, he added, promised 
to hold consultations with foreign countries and utilize its 
friendship with these countries in helping the Somalis face the 
current crisis.

<F P=106> [Article by David Greybe] </F>
  [Text] Government and the ANC [African National Congress] 
have proposed the establishment of a 20-member "volkstaat 
[homeland] council" after the April elections to cater for 
Afrikaner demands for a homeland. They have also proposed the 
insertion of a constitutional principle on self-determination 
which, along with the 33 other principles in the interim 
constitution, will underpin the final constitution to be drafted 
after the election. 
  "The constitution may give expression to any particular form 
of self-determination provided there is substantial proven 
support within the community concerned for such a form of 
self-determination," the proposed principle states. 
  Government and ANC negotiators said at the weekend that the 
proposal should meet the compromise demands of Afrikaner 
Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] co-leader Gen 
Constand Viljoen and it was now up to Viljoen to sell the 
package to his constituency. However, some negotiators do not 
expect the CP [Conservative Party] and AWB [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement] to accept the deal, but are hoping Viljoen will lead 
the rest of the Volksfront into the elections to prove his 
claims that 75 percent of Afrikaners support the demand for a 
volkstaat. 
  A previous compromise deal on a volkstaat made between the 
ANC and Viljoen was rejected at a mass meeting of the Volksfront 
in Pretoria earlier this month. 
  Today's meeting of the negotiating council at Kempton Park 
will discuss these and other government/ANC proposals aimed at 
securing the Freedom Alliance's participation in the transition 
process. The proposal for a volkstaat council forms part of a 
new section to be inserted in the chapter of the interim 
constitution dealing with traditional authorities. "There is 
hereby established a volkstaat council consisting of 20 members 
elected by members of Parliament who support the establishment 
of an Afrikaner volkstaat," the proposal states. 
  The council will conduct its affairs "according to rules 
made 
by the council" and will service as a "constitutional mechanism" 
to enable proponents of a volkstaat to pursue its establishment 
constitutionally. It will, for this purpose, be permitted to: 

  -  Gather, process and make available information regarding 
proposed boundaries, powers and functions and legislative, 
executive and other structures of such a volkstaat, its proposed 
relationship with government at national and provincial level 
"and any other matter directly relevant to the establishment" of 
the volkstaat; 
  -  Make feasibility and "other relevant" studies; 
  -  Submit representations to and advise the constitution-making 
body, or constituent assembly, and the Commission on Provincial 
Government "with regard to the possible establishment of a 
volkstaat and any matter in connection therewith", and 
  -  Perform other functions as may be prescribed by an Act of 
Parliament. 

    The proposal adds the procedures to be followed by the 
volkstaat council in performing its functions will be prescribed 
by Parliament. It further adds: "The procedures provided in 
this constitution with regard to the finalisation of provincial 
boundaries shall not be construed as preventing the 
establishment of such a volkstaat, and in the event of the 
acceptance of a volkstaat alternative provision shall be made by 
an Act of Parliament for the finalisation of the boundaries of 
any affected province or provinces."

  [Text] The negotiating council has decided to send a 
written invitation to the Freedom Alliance inviting them to join 
the council. Negotiating council Chairman Pravin Gordhan said 
he had received feedback that members of the alliance would 
appreciate an invitation requesting some kind of a response to 
the constitutional proposals. Mr. Gordhan said the council 
expected the alliance to respond to the invitation by early 
evening. The council is processing a package of constitutional 
concessions and amendments to secure the Freedom Alliance's 
participation in the election. 
  The government and the ANC [African National Congress] 
earlier submitted their proposals to the negotiating council at 
Kempton Park. The Freedom Alliance did not attend the meeting 
at the World Trade Center.

  [Text] The Freedom Alliance has indicated that the proposed 
amendments to the interim constitution are inadequate and the 
alliance will not participate in the election. Alliance 
Chairman Rowan Cronje said in Pretoria, after a meeting of the 
executive of the alliance, that the concession on the double 
ballot was welcome. However, there was still no autonomy for 
regions to impose taxes, and no guarantee of a volkstaat 
[homeland]. Concessions on the entrenchment of provincial 
powers were also insufficient.

<F P=106> [Report by H.Birns and N. Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria Feb 21 SAPA -- The Freedom Alliance [FA] on 
Monday [21 February] conceded "some victories" had been gained 
in its talks with the government and the African National 
Congress, but said negotiations remained deadlocked due to 
persisting fundamental flaws in the interim constitution. 
  The Alliance said in a statement after meeting in Pretoria 
positive results included the acceptance of the two-ballot 
system; substitution of the name "Natal" by "kwaZulu/Natal"; 
provision for the principle of self-determination; and 
improvements in the fiscal and financial self-government of 
provinces, although no autonomy to raise taxes had been gained. 
  "Nevertheless, these are more than counter-balanced by 
critical and fundamental constitutional issues, which have not 
been resolved and which are vital for peace and stability in 
southern Africa." 
  The Alliance insisted the powers and functions of provincial 
governments had not been improved, nor had concessions been made 
in this regard. It said provincial governments would have less 
powers than those held before 1986 by the present provinces or 
than those of the current self-governing states. 
  Concessions made on the right of provinces to draw up their 
own constitutions which would be protected, had been "devalued 
by the lack of improvement of the very powers that are to be 
protected". 
  There was also still no guarantee that an Afrikaner 
volkstaat 
[homeland] would be established before or after the election, 
and the same held true for others who wanted self-determination. 
  Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje said the FA remained prepared 
to negotiate an inclusive political settlement and would welcome 
it if other parties made continued discussions possible. If they 
do not, then they leave us with no alternative but to look at 
alternatives," Mr Cronje said.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 19 SAPA--Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he won't take part in the 
April election even if his demands are met by the government and 
the African National Congress [ANC], as he won't have enough 
time to campaign for votes. Independent Radio 702 on Saturday 
reported Mr Buthelezi was speaking at Jan Smuts airport near 
Johannesburg on Friday [18 February] evening after meeting 
Swedish foreign minister Margaretha af Ugglas. 
  "It's not really fair (that) if our concerns are met now, 
they don't consider giving us space to campaign and to 
electioneer," he said. He reiterated that government/ANC 
concessions on interim constitution amendments designed to bring 
the Freedom Alliance into the election were "nothing new", 
saying they were "vague and embarassing". Mr Buthelezi said the 
aim of his meeting with Minister af Ugglas had been to push for 
international mediation to break the constitutional deadlock. 
  The Swedish foreign minister said South African role-players 
needed to solve the situation among themselves, but that 
international involvement should be considered if it could help 
the process towards breaking the deadlock. 
  ANC leader Nelson Mandela was reported on Friday as having 
ruled out any postponement of the April election.

  [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi has denied reports which quoted him as saying he would 
not take part in the April election even if his demands were met 
by the government and the ANC [African National Congress]. In a 
telephone interview from Ulundi, Dr. Buthelezi accused the media 
of malicious and irresponsible reporting: 
  [Buthelezi] I would like to say that that is absolutely 
false. I take this as part and parcel of the propaganda that is 
being mounted by certain sections of the media against me, 
against the IFP, and against the Freedom Alliance, because I 
would be mad to talk like that. Because, after all, even today 
there was a meeting between my colleagues and members of the 
government. They were seeking ways of trying to find a way 
which would make us participate if our concerns, as expressed in 
the document of the 19th of December which we gave to both the 
ANC and the government, were met. All I said when one of the 
journalists was putting the question is that in fact it seems to 
me that the government and ANC were deliberately stringing us 
along until we were left without any time to campaign. 
  Dr. Buthelezi was allegedly misquoted after he spoke to 
local 
and foreign journalists at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport 
following a meeting with Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af 
Ugglas.

<F P=106> [By Greg Arde] </F>
  [Text] Pietermaritzburg Feb 20 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi says his party will 
continue to negotiate even though it won't participate in 
elections under the present interim constitution. Addressing 
tens of thousands of supporters at a rally at Taylor's Halt, 
about 20km from the Natal capital of Pietermaritzburg, Mr 
Buthelezi came out strongly in support of peace. saying his 
party did not want war. 
  Mr Buthelezi also accused the government and the African 
National Congress [ANC] of trying to intimidate the IFP into 
fighting elections. He said his party was continuing talks with 
the ANC and government, but accused the two of an "appalling 
style" of negotiating. 
  He said he favoured continued negotiations: "Even at this 
late hour we have avoided belligerence and we believe in 
continuing to negotiate." The IFP president said it was only 
through "true negotiations" that peace would be achieved in 
South Africa. 
  "We know that war serves only to divide the people of South 
Africa. It serves only to split communities and break up 
families. 
  "We know that in the end it will pit orother against 
brother, 
sister against sister, mother against daughter, father against 
son. We in the IFP therefore do not want war. 
  "No one wants peace more than the IFP." 
  The IFP would not be intimidated by the ANC, he said, adding 
"while we know that we will defeat the plans of the ANC 
alliance, we also know that victory will come at a great cost to 
all." 
  "That is why we want to negotiate. That is why we want 
peace." 
  He said a spokesman in the ANC alliance had warned that army 
tanks would roll against the people of kwaZulu. The inhabitants 
of the homeland would be much worse off under an ANC government 
than the present government, he said. The IFP's decision not to 
participate in elections unless its demands were met was a 
"grave one". Many would be forced into voting. 
  If the ANC won the elections it would try and destroy the 
IFP 
and kwaZulu, he said. "We must know this and brace ourselves to 
this onslaught if it happens. 
  "It is far more noble to resist evil and die for what you 
believe in, than to live in chains." 
  Mr Buthelezi said he was against war, but Zulus were a 
"proud 
and warrior" nation which could resist the ANC. Opinion polls 
showing minimal support for the IFP were "lies", he said. 
  He urged followers not to fail in their support for Zulu 
King 
Goodwill Zwelithini, saying participation in the elections under 
the current constitution would be going against the monarch. A 
failure of support for the king on this score would divide the 
Zulu nation, he said. The interim constitution was flawed 
because, among other things, it did not acknowledge the 
sovereignty of the monarch. 
  While he reiterated his strong opposition to elections under 
the present interim constutution, the IFP president's speech was 
not free of electioneering talk: "We are the party of 
prosperity. You can lay your trust in us." 
  Mr Buthelezi promised supporters that if the IFP continued 
to 
rule kwaZulu, jobs would be created and they would be better 
provided for. 
  The ANC, he charged, didn't have a "snowballs chance in 
hell" 
of delivering on its "wild" election promises. "We will have to 
work extremely hard. We must continue to embrace the twin 
pillars of our philosophy in the IFP, which is self-help and 
self-reliance. 
  "We do not want to deceive our youth by promising things 
that 
we will not be able to deliver instantly if we become the 
government," he said. 
  "The IFP is the only party that can bring prosperity to the 
people of South Africa."

<F P=106> [Report by L. Roderick] </F>
  [Text] Piet Retief, South-Eastern Transvaal, Feb 19 SAPA -- 
Zulu monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini, says he hopes all people 
in Natal/kwaZulu will accept him as their king. Speaking to a 
gathering of Zulus near Piet Retief on Saturday [19 February], 
he said he stood firm on his call for an independent Zulu 
monarchy. 
  "I want to give my assurance to all the people of 
kwaZulu/Natal that all your needs will be met under a Zulu 
monarchy," he said, promising to uphold democratic and 
pluralistic values. 
  "This independent state would offer full protection to all 
its people as individuals and members of social and cultural 
formations," he said. 
  The king, at a meeting with State President F W de Klerk 
last 
week announced his plans for secession from South Africa, 
rejecting participation in the country's first non-racial 
election in April. Explaining his move on Saturday, he said 
South Africa's interim constitution was a "threat" to the status 
and institutions of the Zulu kingdom. "The constitution has 
reduced you to playing a minimal tribal and administrative role 
in the running of your communities," he told the gathering of 
tribal leaders and chiefs. 
  He raised the concern that the constitution did not include 
a 
provision which would "ensure that a new government will not 
take the land the monarchy has held in trust for the Zulu 
people". 
  He said his claim for an independent Zulu state was based on 
historical precedent and had been his intention prior to kwaZulu 
Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi's "warning" of a deadlock on 
the question of federalism in constitution negotiations. 
  He called on the tribal chiefs and leaders to "stand 
together" if they were to survive the threats and challenges he 
claimed were being faced by the zulu people.

  [Text] The minister of constitutional affairs, Mr. Roelf 
Meyer, says it will be impossible for [Zulu] King Zwelithini to 
have a sovereign state. Speaking at Noordgezicht near 
Johannesburg, Mr. Meyer said, however, that there was nothing 
against the king having control over his subjects. He said he 
saw the best solution as writing the king's sovereignty into a 
provincial constitution.

  [Text] Bophuthatswana Government and ANC [African National 
Congress] negotiating delegations may meet again this weekend, 
following a positive round of exploratory talks in 
Bophuthatswana today. The head of the Bophuthatswana 
delegation, Mr. Ephraim Keikelane, said after a meeting in the 
Pilanesberg Game Reserve that they had suggested that 
Bophuthatswana should have a confederal relationship with South 
Africa. Mr. Popo Molefe of the ANC said they have spelled out 
the ANC's latest constitutional proposals in detail. He said 
both sides would report back to their principals, and a second 
round of talks was imminent, possibly before the negotiating

<F P=106> [Report by E. Kemp] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town Feb 20 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist Congress 
[PAC] would return to the armed struggle if necessary to ensure 
the return of the land to the African people, PAC President 
Clarence Makwetu said on Sunday [20 February]. Launching his 
organisation's national election campaign at a rally in 
Khayelitsha near Cape Town, he said the PAC's struggle would not 
end until the land had been repossessed. 
  Presenting the PAC's election manifesto, Mr Makwetu told an 
enthusiastic crowd of more than 5,000 people: "Above all, we 
promise you the return of the land of our forefathers which was 
taken from you by force. If it means we must go back to the bush 
to return our land, we will do so." He said a PAC government 
would give each person a plot of land on which they could live 
with their families. 
  The PAC also promised urgent steps to quell violence, firm 
action against the right wing and an immediate end to school 
boycotts. "We have a message to instigators at our schools. From 
now on, we shall defend by any means the right of our children 
to education," Mr Makwetu said. 
  The PAC was under no illusions that the forthcoming 
elections 
marked the beginning of uhuru (freedom) and the end of 
oppression and exploitation. "The significance of the election 
lies in what it can achieve and (that) is up to you, the people. 
A correct mandate will enable the african people to write the 
future constitution which will deliver us from bondage." 
  The PAC president paid tribute to former Azanian Peoples' 
Liberation Army Commander Sabelo Phama, who died in a car 
accident in Tanzania recently. Mr Phama was to have participated 
in the election campaign launch. 
  Earlier, PAC national organiser Maxwell Nemadzivhanani 
appealed to supporters not to "give your vote for co-option 
under the guise of power-sharing". He said the PAC did not need 
necklacing, secret deals or the promise of a volkstaat 
[homeland] to its oppressors to win votes. 
  "Unless the elections are rigged, the PAC will win." 
  Mr Nemadzivhanani accussed the government of harassing and 
intimidating PAC activists since the organisation's decision to 
participate in the election. Firearm licences had been granted 
to all other organisations expect the PAC, which was still 
awaiting the outcome of licence applications lodged eight months 
ago. 
  PAC National Executive Committee member Barney Desai told 
the 
crowd the PAC would "sweep white domination into the sea". The 
struggle would continue after the election "until every inch of 
Azania is truly liberated".

  [Text] Cape Town Feb 20 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist Congress 
[PAC] will abolish all private land transactions once land has 
been constitutionally restored to "the people", according to the 
PAC's election manifesto. Released on Sunday, the document said 
land would be expropriated through a land reform act and a land 
claims court, which would function under the constitutional 
court. The land would then be redistributed among "the people" 
by the state, which would act as curator of all property. 
  The manifesto rejects any protection of freehold title or 
the 
acquisition of land on a "willing buyer, willing seller" basis. 
  Every ctizen is guaranteed equal access to land for 
residential, agricultural and industrial purposes. Plots will be 
allocated to people, who will act as curators of such property. 
Although everyone will be free to live anywhere, agrarian land 
reclaimed constitutionally will be allocated to farmers 
practising agriculture at all levels. 
  "In our view, the restoration and redistribution of land is 
a 
non-negotiable starting point for meaningful reparations. A PAC 
government will not buy our land from the settlers. The settlers 
bought no land from our people." 
  On the economy, the PAC said it would not nationalise 
conglomerates, corporations and financial institutions 
controlled by the private sector, but these would be "socialised 
and democratised to meet the needs of the community at large". 
The concentration of capital in the hands of a few conglomerates 
and family trusts will however be addressed through anti-trust 
laws and deregulation of monopolies. 
  Massive labour-intensive job schemes will be initiated to 
combat unemployment and a PAC government will support the 
creation of small business and co-operatives. 
  The PAC also supported the introduction of a wealth tax to 
supplement direct taxation, which would in turn form the basis 
of state revenue. Indirect taxes will continue to be collected, 
but VAT [value-added tax] on basic necessities such as food and 
medicine will be abolished. The unemployed, aged and disabled 
will be exempt from indirect taxation. 
  The PAC commits itself firmly to affirmative action, but 
says 
high standards of performance must be maintained. Statutory 
"labour tribunals" will have powers to determine whether any 
worker has been discriminated against. 
  Quotas may be introduced in the workplace not only to 
correct 
racial and gender imbalances but also to create a culture of 
[word indistinct] among various sectors of the population. 
  Under a PAC government, the labour movement will be 
guaranteed its independence. The government will recognise the 
right to collective bargaining for all workers, including 
domestic and farm workers, as well as the right to withhold 
labour. 
  A minimum wage will be enacted and enforced by law and the 
system of payment in kind prevalent on farms will be abolished. 
  Workers in essential services [word indistinct] teachers, 
policemen, nurses will be subject to special agreements, such as 
the provision of skeleton staff, to avoid the crippling of 
essential services during a strike. 
  On housing, the manifesto promises that township houses will 
be given to residents who had covered infrastructural costs 
through their rents. 
  The private sector will be encouraged to participate in the 
provision of housing through tax concessions and self-help 
schemes will be encouraged. 
  Single-sex hostels will be abolished and employers such as 
the mining sector will be responsible for the provision of 
family units for employees. Ethnic mixing will be encouraged in 
hostels. 
  The manifesto pledges free and compulsory education up to 
standard 10 for every child. The PAC is committed to a single 
education department, common syllabus for all pupils and an 
integrated education policy.

  [Text] Cape Town Feb 20 SAPA -- The Democratic Party's [DP] 
premiership candidate for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] province, Mr Tony Leon, won the most votes this 
weekend as the party's Federal Electoral College finalised the 
top 55 names on its national list for the National Assembly. 
Only DP leader Dr Zach de Beer, whose position is automatically 
reserved and was thus not included in this weekend's election 
procedure in Cape Town, is ranked above Mr Leon. 
  The other 53 candidates for the April poll include a further 
17 MPs from all three houses of the out-going tricameral 
parliament. It also includes former Pietermaritzburg Progressive

  [Text] General Bantu Holomisa, military leader of Transkei, 
believes that in 12 secret documents he has a few trump cards to 
sink the National Party's [NP] election campaign before 27 
April. "Everything depends on how the NP behaves itself. I am 
considering releasing the documents one by one to the media 
before the election. If F.W. de Klerk and the others want to 
intimidate other parties, then I will definitely throw my cards 
on the table. All that I am prepared to say now is that the 
documents in my possession also contain things that happened 
during Mr. de Klerk's time as state president," according to 
Gen. Holomisa. Last year Gen. Holomisa announced at a press 
conference that he, apart from the now well-known documents 
concerning the "signal" that the eastern Cape activist Matthew 
Goniwe and his associates "should be permanently removed from 
society," also has other documents in his possession on 
government "covert" actions. The announcement of this "signal" 
by General Holomisa directly resulted in the reopening of the 
inquest into the murders of Goniwe and the others on the 
insistence of President de Klerk.

  [Text] Durban Feb 20 SAPA -- The death toll from Saturday 
[19 February] morning's massacre near Creighton in southern 
Natal has risen to 15 after a seriously wounded victim died in 
Pietermaritzburg's Edendale Hospital, police said. Durban SA 
Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said Samuel Ndizimbovu, 25, 
died from gunshot and stab wounds on Saturday. 
  Police, meanwhile, were investigating the attack and no one 
had been arrested by Sunday night. Four gunmen opened fire on a 
group of mainly youths preparing for an African National 
Congress [ANC] voter education workshop in rural Mahehle, 
south-west of Pietermaritzburg. Fourteen people were killed at 
the scene and two were seriously wounded. Police said 11 people 
were killed inside a hut while three died trying to flee their 
attackers in the early hours of Saturday morning. 
  Midlands ANC Chairman Harry Gwala said those killed were 
preparing for an ANC voter education workshop in the area at 
noon. South African Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said a 
group of about 16 youths had spent the night at an abandoned 
house, where they came under attack by four men. The attackers 
opened fire on the group, while some victims were stabbed to 
death. Maj Naidoo confirmed a voter education programme was 
being planned in the area. 
  A Creighton police spokesman said the attack occurred about 
14km from the rural town, south-west of Pietermaritzburg. He 
said the attackers used automatic weapons and homemade guns. 
  Midlands ANC Deputy Chairman Chief Zibuse Mlaba said he 
suspected "those who don't want people to vote," were 
responsible for the massacre. He said the area had been 
relatively stable with no recent incidents of political violence. 
  Nearby Ixopo and Richmond have, however, been wracked by 
intense political fighting since 1990 with a massacre at 
Masanagazane, outside Richmond, two weeks ago when 12 people 
were killed. 
  The ANC was investigating the attack, said Chief Mlaba. 
  The ANC's Natal premier election candidate, Jacob Zuma, on 
Sunday told reporters he feared rural supporters would face 
increasing violence in the run up to elections. 
  Maj Naidoo said police were offering a substantial reward 
for 
information leading to arrests and convictions of those 
responsible for the Mahehle massacre. He named the dead as: 
Mdeni Malunga, 15; Mbuso Nxasane, 17; Dumisani Duzela, 13; 
Thamsanqa Ngcobe, 15; Sokelazwa Mbanjwa, 16; Bongwela Mbanjwa, 
16; Tholozami Cyril Shobo, 12; Mandlenkosi Mbhele, 26; Sifiso 
Ndlovu, 13; Givi Ndlovu, 13; Sibusiso Dusuzi Maphumulo, 15; 
Siyabonga Ngubo, 17; Duduzi Mia, 28; and Kulama Madlala, 16.

  [Excerpts] The death toll in yesterday's massacre near 
Creighton in southern Natal has risen to 15. One of the 
victims, 25-year-old Samuel Ndzimibovu, has died in 
Pietermaritzburg's Edenvale Hospital. [passage omitted] 
  ANC [African National Congress] President Nelson Mandela has 
condemned yesterday's attack on his supporters. He said it was 
common knowledge that there were people in Natal determined to 
disrupt the election. 
  [Begin Mandela recording] It is something which the people 
of 
South Africa cannot tolerate, and something which....[pauses] We 
are determined that nothing is going to stop us from having this 
election. [end recording] 
  Mr. Mandela was speaking at a meeting of the Patriotic 
Front. 
The front met behind closed doors today, to be briefed on the 
proposed amendments to the constitution. Later journalists were 
allowed in. Some of those there today, and the rest of the 
multiparty negotiationg council, meet tomorrow at the World 
Trade Center to table these amendments. The amendments will 
give regions greater powers. But there is still no word on 
whether the Inkatha Freedom Party, Bophuthatswana, or the 
Conservative Party will attend. 
  [Begin ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa recording] We 
think they are giving consideration to the proposals. We are 
made to believe that the Freedom Alliance's top leaders meeting 
is going to be held tomorrow, and we trust that there will be 
some form of response early in the day. [end recording]

  [Text] Ulundi Feb 20 SAPA--Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Sunday [20 February] condemned 
Saturday's massacre of 14 youths in the Southern Natal town of 
Creighton, saying such violence could further polarise South 
African society. He said in a statement in Ulundi he had been 
"extremely shocked and aggrieved" to hear of the massacre. 
  Chief Buthelezi said: "We are never going to have peace and 
prosperity in South Africa by eliminating each other through 
such terrible acts of violence." He had noted with regret that 
there had already been some conjectures by the Midlands 
leadership of the African National Congress [ANC] about who was 
responsible for the carnage. 
  Midlands ANC Deputy Chairman Chief Zibuse Mlaba said on 
Saturday he suspected those who didn't want people to vote were 
responsible for the massacre. The ANC said the victims were 
preparing for an ANC voter education workshop on Saturday and 
police said they were inside a hut when four gunmen shot at 
them. Some of the victims were stabbed to death. 
  On the resignation of IFP's Deputy Secretary-General Simon 
Gumede, Chief Buthelezi said Mr Gumede, a chief, wanted to spend 
more time looking after the affairs of his people. There was no 
bad feeling between himself and Mr Gumede, Chief Buthelezi added.

  [Text] Durban Feb 21 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela's intimations that Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi was 
responsible for the weekend massacre in Natal encouraged further 
violence, the IFP said on Monday [21 February]. Mr Mandela on 
Sunday said Saturday's killing of 15 ANC supporters in Creighton 
was the result of Natal leaders' irresponsible talk urging 
resistance to the April elections. 
  IFP spokesman Ed Tillet said on Monday Mr Mandela's 
response, 
"far from subduing inflamed passions, encourages a violent 
counter response to avenge the mass slaying". 
  "For a man of his perceived stature, we find it highly 
unfortunate that he succumbs to apportioning blame before 
allowing law enforcement agencies to determine culpability." 
  The IFP appealed to all political leaders to "consider their 
words and rhetoric very carefully during this time of great 
upheaval and uncertainty". 
  Mr Tillet expressed his party's condolences to the families 
of the victins. The IFP has always subscribed to the philosophy 
that an eye for an eye makes the entire world blind, he said.

President F.W. de Klerk is still lying about key aspects of his 
government's nuclear weapons programme. 
  First disclosed in AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, Blaauw's evidence 
was 
the the subject of a MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN front page story last 
week, 
which called into question De Klerk's assertion last year that 
South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons technology or 
material from another country, or provided another country with 
nuclear materials. Reacting to the expose, De Klerk insisted 
that South Africa's procurement of 30g of tritium from Israel, 
and its provision of yellow cake uranium to Israel, were not 
part of collaboration between the countries on nuclear and 
conventional weapons. 
  His statement was endorsed by Atomic Energy Corporation 
chief 
Waldo Stumpf. Cape Supreme Court documents make it clear that 
Blaauw was the government's key intermediary in sensitive 
military deals with Israel, including those involving tritium 
and yellow cake. 
  It was General Hendrik van den Bergh, head of the Bureau for 
State Security (Boss) who personally asked Blaauw to get 
tritium, according to the documents. They note that the 30g 
Blaauw ultimately secured "was sufficient for the manufacture of 
12 atomic bombs". 
  The tritium shipments were so sensitive that ranking South 
African and Israeli officials accompanied the 12 air shipments 
of the gaseous substance, and the heads of both governments were 
notified each time a shipment was successfully completed, 
according to the newly published book CRITICAL MASS by U.S. 
journalists William Burrows and Robert Windrem. 
  Much of what South African officials withheld from the 
public 
was told to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), which is charged with verifying the government's 
compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. According 
to a confidential IAEA document -- it bears the identifying 
numbers GOV/2684 and 93-03174 -- South Africa's Atomic Energy 
Corporation "received some tritium in 1977, but after the 
withdrawal of a small sample for the verification of its 
quality, the material remained in store until 1987". 
  During that time, according to the IAEA document, South 
Africa was engaged in "theoretical and practical" research on 
"lithium-6 separation for the production of tritium for possible 
future use in boosted devices". 
  The government also did the preliminary engineering work on 
a 
reactor -- "to be built at a site at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay" 
-- to produce and recover plutonium and tritium, says the IAEA, 
repeating information provided by the De Klerk administration. 
It adds: "In September 1985 the South African government 
decided to...stop all work related to possible plutonium devices 
and to limit the production of lithium-6, but to allow further 
development work on implosion technology and theoretical work on 
more advanced devices." 
  The 1985 date seems compellingly to coincide with the 
refusal 
of international financial organisations to roll over their 
loans to South Africa. It is reasonable to infer that if 
sanctions had not started to bite, the South African Government 
would have built an advanced nuclear device whose only purpose 
could be to attack--or threaten--nations within range of its 
surface-to-surface ballistic missiles. 
  Even after putting its advanced weapons programme on ice, 
South Africa kept the tritium for another two years. With 
extensive Israeli help, it worked on developing its own versions 
of Israel's Jericho missiles. 
  After the two countries jointly tested a South African 
Jericho clone from the Overberg test range in July 1989, U.S. 
officials told reporters that one of the several missiles Israel 
was helping South Africa develop was intended for delivering 
nuclear warheads. Last year De Klerk asserted that South Africa 
only planned to make seven crude nuclear weapons and only 
intended the six which were actually made as a "deterrent". 
This purportedly meant testing a bomb in order to blackmail 
Washington to save the established order from "total onslaught". 
  At an international conference last weekend to discuss 
future 
nuclear policy for South Africa, the head of the ANC's [African 
National Congress] science and technology department, Roger 
Jardine, slammed De Klerk's "list of lies" about South Africa's 
nuclear weapons programme. He called for the nuclear industry 
to be opened to full public scrutiny.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>
  Gather Strength to Preserve Peace -- "As South Africa enters 
the last, nailbiting phase of its transition to democracy, it 
may be wise to assume that the election will go ahead in the 
teeth of opposition from elements of the Freedom Alliance. 
Almost certainly that opposition will employ violent methods," 
an editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 20 
February on page 24 notes. "The horrific murder of 14 ANC 
[African National Congress] canvassers in Natal serves notice of 
what lies ahead." However, "talk of `civil war' is both 
exaggerated and premature." "Stress fractures are beginning to 
show in the ranks" of the Freedom Alliance. In Natal Chief 
Buthelezi's moderates are "falling away" and "among the white 
right-wingers there are two clearly defined factions led by 
General Constand Viljoen and by Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg (with the 
raving Eugene Terreblanche usurping leadership as the posturing 
becomes more extreme)." "The murder of the ANC canvassers (and 
the continuing assassination of Inkatha leaders, for that 
matter) suggests that intervention cannot be far off." It would 
be "unconscionable" for any "opponent of the election" to use 
"the resources of the state, whether Bantustan police or rural 
police and military reservists, to conduct a campaign of 
violence against the state. The first step is to ensure that 
such resources are under proper control." 
<H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>
  Business Responsibliity -- An editorial in Johannesburg 
SUNDAY NATION in English on 20 February on page 6 notes that 
"major business giants have been generating colossal profits 
under the protection of an apartheid system." "Business must 
realise that the buzz-word `free market economy' makes little or 
no sense sense to more than half of the economically active 
population which remains unemployed, to hundreds of thousands of 
kids without schools, to millions of people without clean water 
or access to health care facilities to name a few." "The main 
protection of our new democracy will be in ensuring that the 
majority of the population, tha main victims of apartheid's 
injustices, end with a new more meaningful life with values that 
underpin commitment and positive faith in a new society." 
<H6>  SATURDAY STAR </H6>
  Old South Africa -- "Standerton displayed the worst of the 
old South Africa this week -- adamant refusal by a magistrate to 
allow a protest march, police firing shotguns and teargas at a 
massed crowd, trucks burning in the township. It was a sobering 
reminder that processes that have taken hold in some places -- 
negotiated agreements to allow protest, minimum force by the 
police, active monitoring and marshalling -- are not in place in 
others," an editorial in the Johannesburg SATURDAY STAR in 
English on 19 February on page 10 notes. "The powerful men in 
plattleland [rural areas] towns say they don't want their towns 
torn apart. But they don't seem to have learnt one of the main 
lessons of the old South Africa -- that stifling protest is the 
surest way to guarantee conflict." 
<H6>  RAPPORT </H6>
  Optimism Over Settlement Not Unfounded -- "The finer details 
on the concessions which the government and the African National 
Congress made this week are still unknown," says a page-22 
editorial on the Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans of 20 
February. "But in the main the package sounds like an important 
step in the right direction of the creation of a true federation 
in South Africa, with important powers to the provinces." "But 
the unhappiness in the Freedom Alliance over the manner in which 
the package was presented points to a deep-seated mistrust of 
the parties that made the proposals. This suspicion will 
hopefully be removed this week if the alliance can be convinced 
of the honest intention that provinces must enjoy greater 
autonomy in the new dispensation. It is also in the interests 
of the members of the alliance that they in turn convince the 
country of their honest intention to reach a settlement in order 
to remove suspicion towards them." "A true federation is 
essential if an inclusive solution is desired by all parties," 
warns RAPPORT. "No party with confederal ambitions should 
disguise its goal behind pseudo federalism." "Initial 
indications are that the latest proposals, `self-determination' 
and all, still have not resolved the homeland issue. And it is 
not easy. In the absence of concrete proposals in this regard, 
the most sensible option of moderate right-wingers would be to 
follow an evolutionary path towards the establishment of an own 
territory. Clear demands must be presented, which can then be 
entrenched in a new constitution. It is in this that people like 
General Constand Viljoen and others need to take the lead. 
Optimism over an historic constitutional agreement is there 
thus not unfounded. But time is marching relentlessly on." 
  Choice for Freedom Alliance is Simple -- In an article on 
page 23 of RAPPORT, Anne-Marie Mischke writes: "By the end of 
the week the government and the African National Congress [ANC] 
were able to heave a sigh of relief. They believe they are once 
again on that very hallowed piece of earth, the moral high 
ground, where every South African politician has for the past 
few years been trying to get a foothold. To gain this moral 
high ground, a politician or a party must be able to say to the 
world, look, I did the right thing; whatever happens, my hands 
are clean. So the government and the ANC feel they have arrived 
there this week, with their package of concessions." "There was 
much sympathy for the problems facing the two parties, given 
their unbending negotiating partners who contunually moved the 
goalposts." "The choice facing the Freedom Alliance is actually 
simple: Do they want to go ahead with their all-or-nothing 
attitude, or to they want to accept the concessions and use them 
after the election for further bargaining? It is the latter 
strategy which General Constand Viljoen was holding up to the 
Afrikaner National Front when he was shouted down two weeks ago. 
The new constitutional principle on self-determination as well 
as a mechanism for the further consideration of a homeland after 
the election provide the basis for this strategy. The alliance 
does, however, not have too much time to decide what they are 
going to do." "The government and the ANC insitst that the 
election date is final and untouchable. We all know that in 
politics nothing is final and untouchable -- but in the minds of 
the government and the ANC that date is certainly written in 
stone for now."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Warning Against U.S., Other Interference in Election--"In 
keeping with his self-appointed role as president-in-waiting, Mr 
Mandela, during his visit to The Hague last week, put in a 
ten-minute call to President Clinton to discuss the steps that 
the ANC has taken in recent days to facilitate the participation 
of all parties in the April election, to quote White House Press 
Secretary Dee-Dee Myers," notes the page-6 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 21 February. A point 
illustrated by the "Mandela-Clinton chat is that the U.S. is 
still interfering in our affairs." The United States, and other 
foreign governments, are urged not to show "any partiality" to 
any contender in the election. "There cannot be a free and fair 
election if foreign governments interfere directly or 
indirectly. It is not for the United States to 'push' 
dissenting groups to participate in the election." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  PAC Election Participation Welcome -- "Be grateful that the 
PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] is participating" in the election, 
states a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English 
on 22 February. "It is nonparticipation that put the chips on 
PAC shoulders in the first place. Let its members now 
experience the parliamentary subcommittees and the 
practicalities of administration. Let them discover the role of 
loyal opposition. Let them take their places among the elected 
leaders of a democracy, and we shall see the less defensible 
portions of their policies whither away." Democracy has the 
effect of "downscaling enemies into rivals, mortal conflicts 
into pragmatic agreements." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  No Credible Force To Keep Peace in Natal -- "The continuing 
efforts to draw the Freedom Alliance [FA], especially Inkatha, 
back into the constitutional process seem to have little effect 
on Buthelezi, though Inkatha's four bottom-line conditions can 
apparently be met," notes Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 
on 22 February in a page-10 editorial. "He still sees no merit 
in returning to round table negotiations, and tells his 
supporters to resist any efforts to force them to vote on April 
27." In view of this "there must be serious doubts that free 
and fair elections will be possible in large areas of Natal." 
The problem for the government and the Transitional Executive 
Council is that "they do not have a credible force to keep the 
peace in Natal." A peacekeeping force without representation 
from Inkatha will have "no legitimacy in areas where Inkatha has 
a following. Any deployment of this force in Natal will be 
portrayed as an invasion by Umkhonto we Sizwe." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Service `Virtually Collapsed' in Venda -- "Bantustans like 
Venda are going to pot," warns a page-8 editorial in 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 22 February. "Reports claim 
that services have virtually collapsed in Venda with the capital 
city, Thohoyandou, in a mess." SOWETAN believes Venda 
illustrates "the failures and evils of the old homeland 
policies." 
<H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>
  ANC's Compromise Proposals Basis for Further Talks -- 
Referring to the ANC's constitutional "compromise proposals" 
made to the Freedom Alliance which were rejected by Inkatha 
Chief Buthelezi, Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 20 
February says: "This merry-go-round has been going on for a 
long time now. Our people are frustrated by this politicking 
which does not seem to be getting anywhere." The ANC has 
acceded to the two-ballot system, and "as a sop to the white 
right who are demanding their own Volkstaat [homeland], the ANC 
now accepts the principle of self-determination can be 
negotiated. These are important shifts. They may fall short of 
Inkatha and the FA's demands, but they should serve as a basis 
for further discussion. It is bad faith to reject them without 
due consideration."

<F P=106> [Telephone report by correspondent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The proceedings at the Lusaka peace talks this week 
is seen as one of the most difficult stages in the second round 
of the talks. For the first time, National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] has complied with its promise to 
present its response to the first proposal, which sought to 
narrow differences concerning the specific principles that will 
govern the national reconciliation process. In practice, it 
turned a blind eye to the protocols and understandings that have 
already been reached. 
  UNITA wants three of the government's six key ministries; it 
wants provincial governments to have autonomous powers and their 
own police forces; it wants participation in all strategic 
companies, including the National Angolan Fuel Company, 
Sonangol, and the Angola National Diamond Enterprise, Endiama, 
which are viewed as preferred targets. It wants public 
competition for a new symbol of the Republic and a new national 
anthem. It wants immunity for its men and diplomatic passports, 
and it wants its property returned. 
  The government team to the talks was called this afternoon 
to 
respond to UNITA's position. It admitted that it might make 
some concessions, but it described the document as contradicting 
the principles that have already been signed.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to the Council </F>
of Ministers at the Palace of the Congress in Luanda on 21 
February -- recorded] 
  [Text] Dear Prime Minister and distinguished members of the 
Council of Ministers: Today, we shall analyze the government's 
social and economic program that defines economic, social, and 
institutional policies, goals, and measures for 1994. 
  This work has been done by a technical commission made up of 
more than 10 economists and some jurists. That commission was 
led by the secretary of state for planning and the deputy 
finance minister, with the help of the Council of Ministers 
assistant secretary. 
  That commission has proposed that prices be readjusted. In 
other words, there must be changes in the foreign exchange and 
interest rates. Salaries and prices must be readjusted. That 
commission has also proposed the scrapping of administrative 
methods for managing foreign earnings; a reduction in public 
expenditure and in the General State Budget deficit; an increase 
in fiscal revenue; a public investment policy; a set of measures 
to stimulate Angolan private investment and to attract foreign 
investment; and to define a strategy to reschedule the foreign 
debt. In short, conditions are sought to stabilize the national 
currency, increase salaries, make investment viable, and recover 
economic growth. 
  Some of the measures are harsh, but intentions are good. 
This time, we predict that we will be able to move from good 
intentions to practical action. Obviously, this continues to be 
the program that is possible under the circumstances of war 
currently besetting our country. Nevertheless, let us not use 
the situation of war to justify all insufficiencies and failures 
to achieved planned goals. 
  The fundamental measures in this program were approved in 
September of last year. They have not been implemented only 
because of a lack of firmness or failure to carry out the 
required tasks at the right time. 
  The performance period we are entering into now is one of 
the 
greatest responsibility. If the proposed program is implemented 
with rigor, discipline, and seriousness, we may be able to 
stanch the country's serious economic crisis. Gradually, we may 
start overcoming it with a view to improving our people's living 
standards. 
  Faced with a war effort and an undeclared state of 
emergency, 
the state has been forced to divert important resources to 
provide logistical support and to reequip the army and the 
police. Those resources had initially been earmarked for the 
economy and for national reconstruction. The state was also 
forced to return to an administrative system to allocate foreign 
exchange resources. This was the situation until the third 
quarter of last year. The armed forces and the national 
(?police force) have discharged their duties with dedication and 
a high degree of patriotism. 
  Starting virtually from scratch in October of 1992 and 
having 
to fight against an army that was well equipped and which Jonas 
Savimbi had kept hidden, our forces proved, as far back as 
August of last year, that the democratic government elected by 
the Angolan people could not be overthrown by the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] military forces. 
  However, the government lacked the necessary mobility to 
created the conditions needed for moving from emergency to 
economic reform programs. This situation allows me to conclude 
that it is well nigh impossible to manage an economy facing a 
crisis without the existence of a government organ that will be 
responsible for devising, coordinating, and managing economic 
programs. In view of that, I believe there is an urgent need to 
create an organ, which will be equivalent to a ministry, and 
which will be responsible for dealing with structural and 
macroeconomic problems in the medium and long terms. 
  I think that some preconceived ideas in regard to the former 
Ministry of Planning and its cadres have now been laid to rest. 
Studies on economic reform guidelines have always come from that 
ministry. The coordination of the government's economic sector 
could be handed over to the current Planning State Secretariat, 
which might evolve to become the Ministry of Planning and 
Economic Coordination which, in general terms, would be 
responsible for drawing up the government's economic programs, 
for devising general economic and social development policies 
and, eventually, to bring order to Angolan territory and to 
define strategies for negotiation with the principal 
international financial institutions. 
  The Finance Ministry is currently entrusted with those 
duties 
because there is no organ that deals specifically with them. It 
can readjust its organizational structure to meet the important 
tasks it has been allocated daily to deal with problems arising 
from the economic crisis and other economy-related matters. 
  Certainly, there is a need for other forms of restructuring 
in terms of the government's organization and its higher 
structures responsible for management and executive affairs. To 
that end, it is my belief that pertinent studies will be made 
concerning strategic management and the promotion of cadres 
capable of guaranteeing sucess for the aforesaid program. 
  We must not wait for the war to end so we can move 
resolutely 
in that direction. If peace arrives sooner rather than later, 
then all the better. It will expand our room for maneuver and 
increase our responsibilities concerning the complete promotion 
of national reconciliation. However, we must continue to follow 
our path if peace does not arrive so soon. 
  UNITA continues to carry out offensive military operations 
in 
various parts of the country. It has been killing innocent 
people. It has been destroying economic infrastructure. It has 
hindered or impeded productive work as well as the free movement 
of people and goods. 
  Obviously, such military pressure from UNITA will not change 
the government stance at the negotiating table. What is more, 
this government must not fold its arms in the face of that 
military offensive either. The Angolan Armed Forces must reply 
to the attacks being carried out by the UNITA military forces 
and defend the people. By the same token, such pressure will 
not force the government team to abandon the Lusaka peace talks, 
particularly in view of the great progress that has been made at 
those talks. 
  In short, we must reply on the ground when we are attacked 
and, simultaneously, deal correctly and constructively with 
developments at the Lusaka peace talks, until a lasting and 
verifiable cease-fire agreement has been reached. 
  It is my belief that both the mediators and the observer 
countries are attentive to all ploys aimed at sabotaging the 
Lusaka peace talks and that such ploys will not be tolerated.

  [Text] The speech delivered by the president of the 
Republic of Angola to the Council of Ministers yesterday was 
condemned by Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] 
officers in the battle fronts. Those officers said the head of 
Futungo de Belas is misinformed about the military situation in 
the country, since it is the Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] who is currently involved in an 
offensive in the north, center and south of Angola. They added 
that at present the MPLA-PT is launching an offensive in the 
north of Bengo Province, in the east of Cubal, and north west of 
Lubango, displaying sophisticated war materiel recently acquired 
from Western countries. The FALA officers said Eduardo dos 
Santos' speech expressed the desire for war. Another source in 
Jamba said the speech was characteristic of warmongering 
generals who only prosper with prolonged war, and it is typical 
of communist generals to pretend to be victims while in fact 
they are the aggressors.

They say many government tanks and armored vehicles with heavy 
artillery are moving towards UNITA positions in the province. 
Air support is being provided to the tanks and armored vehicles 
by fighter aircraft and bombers from the Angolan Air Force. The 
latest fighting is centered in an area between the towns of 
Cacula and (Negola).

as coward provocations to which FALA responded promptly, killing 
12 FAPLA soldiers.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 21 SAPA -- Malawi's President 
Kamuzu Banda is reported to be critically ill, possibly from 
complications following brain surgery in South Africa late last 
year. Official government spokesmen could not be reached for 
comment on a report carried in an independent newspaper in 
Blantyre. 
  The NEW EXPRESS said a group of women scheduled to meet with 
Dr. Banda had been prevented from seeing the president when they 
arrived at the presidential Sanjika Palace last week. The 
newspaper quoted members of the delegation as saying they had 
been barred from meeting the president because he was in poor 
health. 
  The National Consultative Council, which also sought a 
meeting with the Malawi leader, also failed to secure an 
appointment. 
  A Western diplomat reached for comment by telephone from 
Johannesburg said rumours had been circulating the country about 
Dr Banda's illness, but he added he could not confirm the news 
report. 
  In an apparent bid to scotch the reports, Health and Foreign 
Minister Heatherwick Ntaba last week told the official media the 
president was in good health. 
  Dr Banda, believed to be in his 90s, underwent surgey to 
remove excess fluid from his brain last October. After a break 
during which the Presidential Council ran the country, he 
resumed leadership, but he appointed new ministers to control 
several ministries that had been in his hands for about three 
decades.

  [Text] Malawi Customs at Kamuzu Airport, Lilongwe, have 
announced the interception of a cargo that could be very 
embarrassing for somebody: a container load of arms and 
ammunition flown in from neighboring South Africa. It comes at 
a highly sensitive time, with multiparty elections coming up on 
17 May. On the line to Lilongwe, Jeremy Skeat asked our 
reporter, Charles Simango, what was in the cargo. 
  [Begin recording] [Simango] There were about 71 kg of 
bulletproof jackets, 81 kg of shotgun accessories, 345 kg of 
shotgun ammunition, and about 360 kg of (?pellets) -- I am not 
quite aware what that is -- totaling around 857 kg of guns, 
ammunition, and bulletproof jackets. 
  [Skeat] Now, you say all these arms and bulletproof jackets 
were found in a container. Where was the container due to go to? 
  [Simango] The container was addressed to the Agricultural 
Development Corporation of Malawi, which is (?Admac). (?Admac) 
here deals in agriculture, loaning farming inputs [as heard] to 
farmers, and buying farm produce. 
  [Skeat] Can you think of any reason at all why this 
Agricultural Development Corporation would need arms? 
  [Simango] That was very puzzling indeed, because Manica 
Freight, which deals in air cargo, cargo in general--air or land 
cargo--were contacted today and they say that the addressee, 
really, they do not know who it is. So, we do not know. Maybe 
the Agricultural Development Corporation has just been framed. 
Or they know something--it was something that was done by the 
back door. 
  [Skeat] What are the police and customs officials saying 
about this whole (?thing)? 
  [Simango] The customs officials just managed to hand over 
the 
arms and ammunitions to the Malawi Army and Police and, 
apparently, at the moment the police have taken over the case. 
So far, we have not heard anything, any comments from the 
police, so definitely they are investigating. 
  [Skeat] You say these arms were flown into Malawi. Where did 
they come from? 
  [Simango] It is quite clear that these arms and ammunition 
have originated from South Africa, because there is a document 
which clearly indicates an import and export permit from the 
South African Police. In fact, this document, half of it is 
written in English and half of it, particularly the import and 
export permit, is written in Afrikaans. 
  [Skeat] Has there been any political reaction to this arms 
[word indistinct]? 
  [Simango] Not at the moment. Apparently, most of the 
politicians are not aware of this discovery yet. [end recording]

  [Text] Blantyre, Feb 18 (AFP) -- The opposition weekly 
MALAWI DEMOCRATIC said Friday [18 February] it had received 
death threats over a story about an opposition party leader, 
Bakili Muluzi. 
  The paper last week published a story revealing how Muluzi, 
favoured to win May 17 presidential race, was jailed for six 
months for stealing government funds 25 years ago while working 
as a civil servant. 
  The newspaper is a mouthpiece of the opposition Alliance for 
Democracy Party, while Muluzi is leader of the United Democratic 
Front Party. 
  "Since the story was published, we have received more than 
15 
serious death threats through telephones and written messages," 
editor Charles Simango told AFP Friday. 
  He said he was not surprised with the threats, but added "we 
had overwhelming evidence" to back up the story. "The paper 
remains unshaken as long as we report the truth," Simango said. 
  Muluzi, former right-hand man of President Kamuzu Banda, 
told 
another newspaper THE NATION that the MALAWI DEMOCRATIC had 
"sinister intentions to make the people of Malawi discredit me." 
  Muluzi, who comes from the majority south, said: "It is upon 
the people of Malawi to decide whether they want me as a leader 
or not." Observers say the newspaper revelations have damaged 
his standing. 
  A two-day constitutional conference beginning February 21 is 
likely to recommend that presidential candidates must not 
criminal records of dishonesty, a source in the national 
consultative council told AFP. [sentence as received] 
  The council, which includes representatives from all 
political parties and manages Malawi's transition to democratic 
pluralism, has been writing a new constitution which will 
adopted during the conference.

  [Text] Malawi's preparations for the multiparty elections 
in May have got under way today with the beginning of voter 
registration and the start of three days of debate on the 
Constitution. For the last few months, the National 
Consultative Council, which has representatives from both the 
ruling Congress Party and the opposition, has been working on 
changes to the old one-party system and now a constitutional 
conference is being held in Blantyre, from where Willie Zinkhane 
reports: 
  [Begin Zinkhane recording] The constitutional conference 
opened on a hot note today in Blantyre, where 250 delegates from 
all walks have the difficult task of (?commenting) on the draft 
Constitution drawn up by the National Consultative Council. In 
the afternoon, the presidents of seven contesting parties had 
10-minute speeches to (?share) their expectations of the new 
Constitution. President Hastings Banda was represented by his 
deputy, Gwanda Chakuamba Phiri, who said the new Constitution 
should be a model that will work. From the speeches delivered 
this afternoon by the political party presidents, several 
critical points came out clearly: the new Constitution should 
reduce [word indistinct] the powers of the president, respect 
for human rights, independence of the judiciary, press freedom, 
land distribution, and the role of women and of the disabled. 
  Traditional chiefs, who did not have the floor today, looked 
excited about the developments. One traditional chief said: we 
are happy that we [words indistinct] in the new Constitution, 
unlike during the one-party system, when everything was dictated 
to us. 
  Meanwhile, the registration of voters has started in all the 
(?24) districts of Malawi. Reports from both rural and urban 
areas indicate that the turnout was good, but was mainly 
dominated by the youth, who rushed for the registration points. 
  With the voting age coming down from 21 to 18, many boys and 
girls look at the whole exercise with special interest. [end

  [Text] In his regular Friday news conference, UN Special 
Representative Dr. Aldo Ajello has described as closed the issue 
on the opening of assembly areas, now that 49 assembly areas are 
available. Radio Mozambique Journalist Emilio Manhique reports: 
  [Begin Manhique recording] Moreover, Aldo Ajello presented a 
brief report on the outcome of investigations into allegations 
that the government was training 1,000 soldiers in area two, 
Nampula Province, and the discovery of an arms cache in 
Inhamizua, Beira. Ajello said the allegation that the government 
was training soldiers was a misunderstanding and noted that the 
government had requested -- in conformity with the cease-fire 
rules -- to use the area as a transit center for its troops and 
was duly authorized by the commission; and because of this there 
is no violation. 
  He added that at present 600 soldiers are confined in the 
area and are scheduled to leave for Angoche and Namialo assembly 
areas within the next 10 days. 
  The Cease-Fire Commission has decided that as of now the use 
of transit centers must be subjected to a number of rules -- 
namely, the center cannot accommodate more than 150 people for 
more than 10 days. The centers may have 48 permanent members to 
grant logistical assistance and other tasks. 
  On the second allegation concerning the arms cache in 
Inhamizua, Beira, Ajello said the commission sent to the area to 
investigate the issue interviewed witnesses who confirmed the 
existence of weapons in the area. The witnesses said the 
weapons were carried by the police. Ajello said when the police 
were approached on the issue, they said they had no authority to 
speak with the investigation team, an attitude which Ajello 
described as correct. Thus, in conformity with the rules, the 
issue was transferred to the National Commission for Police 
Affairs, Compol. 
  Commenting briefly on the two issues, the UN special 
representative in Mozambique urged the two sides to adhere to 
regular ways of dealing with these problems before leveling 
accusations in the press. He noted that this environment does 
not help create a climate of trust since it poisons the 
atmosphere. Ajello said he expects the sides to learn a lesson 
from this issue. 
  Concerning the investigation into the alleged sexual abuse 
of 
children by UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] children, 
Ajello said the investigation is complete and by the end of next 
week a report on the issue will be presented. On the issue of 
the appointment of two advisers, who will work with the UN 
representative in Mozambique, Ajello said he expects much from 
Oscar Monteiro and Andre Thomashausen, who will assist him in 
all legal issues related to the implementation of the General 
Peace Accord, particularly in building up trust between the 
sides. 
  On General Mateus Ngonhamo's allegation that General Lelio 
Goncalves is an office general, Ajello said it was not polite of 
Ngonhamo to have attacked him after he left the country. He 
said he has great admiration for Goncalves, whom he described as 
an excellent officer. Ajello said one of Goncalves' great 
qualities was to do his job, adding that he did not also try to 
become a political leader and did not make any statement before 
his departure. Ajello, who views Ngonhamo as an excellent 
general, suggested that he should do the same, because, quote, 
politics is not his job, unquote. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with PPLM President Neves Serrano by Domingos </F>
Alberto; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Alberto] What is the ideological stand of the 
Mozambique Liberal Progress Party [PPLM]? 
  [Serrano] In terms of ideology, the PPLM stands for social 
democracy, based on religious communities. 
  [Alberto] What kind of state does the PPLM favor? 
  [Serrano] The PPLM is aware of a series of state theories in 
existence, such as a centralized presidential system, semi- 
presidential system, and anarchical and utopian systems 
[anarquico utopico]. The PPLM favors the introduction of a 
centalized presidential system in the country, based on 
federalism, where regional governments are free to make certain 
decisions connected with their regions. 
  [Alberto] Of the various state theories, which one do you 
think is the best for Mozambique? 
  [Serrano] The PPLM believes that the centralized 
presidential 
system is the best for the country, in that it provides for the 
existence of a constitutional high court which can impute the 
Head of State. With this kind of state, we can avoid cases of 
generalized corruption in a country like ours where civil 
servants abuse power. The PPLM also stands for a strong 
parliament. This is actually the tendency in democratic 
countries. There is a need to separate legislative, judicial, 
and executive powers to avoid abuse of power. There should be 
an executive power made up of the prime minister who responds 
for the government and the President of the Republic who in 
general responds for political issues (state and government 
issues). The other power which involves the people in general, 
is the Parliament, with legislative powers. Then, there is the 
Judicial power represented by the High Court.... 
  [Alberto] With the consolidation of peace, do you think it 
is 
possible to gradually eliminate centralized economy in favor of 
a decentralized economy? 
  [Serrano] The way I see things at the moment, I do not think 
it is easy. I say this for one specific reason: During 16 
years of war, Mozambique lived under a centralized system of 
economy. It is not from one day to the next that we are going 
to end this system. To resolve the problems facing the 
Mozambican economy, the PPLM proposes: One, to inform donors 
and other economic partners that we need money because we do not 
have yet. When they are ready to assist us or cooperate with us 
in any undertaking, we shall make use of our export commodities, 
such as prawns, and so on.... 
  [Alberto] What kind of economic and social system does the 
PPLM advocate? 
  [Serrano] The PPLM advocates a free market economy, with 
economic democratization and freedom, as well as the 
establishment of a "joint venture" [preceding word in English] 
system in certain fields, with most developed countries. This 
means that the Cooperation Ministry would sign bilateral 
agreements with any state. What is more, businessmen would be 
free to make undertakings with their foreign partners to advance 
the country's economy. This is not happening presently because 
of the Government's selfishness or mismanagement. 
  [Alberto] What would be your government's priorities if you 
would win the forthcoming free and democratic elections? 
  [Serrano] Among dozens of sectorial programs that the PPLM 
possesses, I would first give priority to education and health, 
in order to create conditions for our people's welfare. In 
brief, I would concern myself with assisting our people who are 
experiencing absolute misery. 
  [Alberto] But how would the PPLM realize this objective 
under 
the present conditions in the country? 
  [Serrano] Although the PPLM is aware that our country may 
break away from the International Monetary Fund in future, there 
is an urgent need to create conditions in order to renegotiate 
the agreement with this interanational institution, since this 
is the only way Mozambique can resolve its basic needs. The 
PPLM would also encourage people to return to rural areas to 
engage in subsistence agriculture. I say subsistence 
agriculture because Mozambique has no funds.... 
  [Alberto] Apart from the projects you have mentioned, what 
other priorities does the PPLM have? 
  [Serrano] As I said earlier, among dozens of programs that 
the PPLM has, we give priority to education and health. All the 
same, there are other economic and social projects which are 
also important. In the economic field, the PPLM is determined 
to develop agriculture to make it the foundation for economic 
development. The PPLM also intends to revitalize primary, 
secondary, and tertiary activities, such as industry, 
construction, transportation, wildlife and forests. In the 
social field, the PPLM intends to establish a fiscal policy that 
would rationalize and lessen the fiscal burden on the less 
privileged people. In the field of labor, it wants to guarantee 
employment and in the field of justice, it wants to guarantee 
human rights, providing legal assistence to all citizens. 
  [Alberto] At present, politicians are arguing over what 
system to implant in the country after elections. Some want 
federalism, others a unitary state. What should be followed? 
  [Serrano] As far as the PPLM is concerned, both federalism 
and a centralized presidential system (unitary state) are 
acceptable. Let us see, federalism is defined as a political 
organization where government activities are carried out both by 
regional governments and the government of the Republic of the 
country which is responsible for the maintenance of national 
unity. Regional governments have the power and freedom to make 
local decisions, for example with regard to the exploration of 
resources. Many leaders think federalism signifies the 
destruction of national unity. That is not true. 
  [Alberto] There are many parties in the national political 
arena. Does the PPLM hope to ally itself to other parties to 
form a coalition? 
  [Serrano] For the immediate future, the answer to your 
question is negative. So far, the unarmed opposition parties 
and even the ruling party have not yet come up with distinct 
philosophies. I will not ally myself to a person or party whose 
program I do not know well. The PPLM feels it is premature to 
speak about this issue. 
  [Alberto] Elections will be held in nine months' time. Has 
the PPLM already drawn up its campaign program? 
  [Serrano] Good question. The PPLM has a political mechanism 
[preceding word in English] capable of carrying out a positive 
electoral campaign, which will even surprise certain politicians. 
  [Alberto] Apart from the funds made available by the 
government, what other financial assistance does your party 
count on for the electoral campaign and other programs? 
  [Serrano] As far as the PPLM is concerned, the funds 
promised 
by the national community are secondary, because they may not 
materialize. The PPLM counts on European, U.S., and Asian 
partners for its finances. 
  [Alberto] What do you think of the confinement process until 
the present date? 
  [Serrano] Well, I think your question is excellent, in that 
you are making it at the right time. Before I answer it, I 
would like to say the following, however: Apparently, it seems 
as if everything is progressing smoothly. If we deeply examine 
the process, we shall realize, however, that there is still a 
lot of work to be done by the signatories of the General Peace 
Accord, and the United Nations, particulary Mr. Aldo Ajello, 
special representative of the UN secretary general in Mozambique. 
  [Alberto] The way the peace process is moving, do you think 
it would be possible to hold the first multiparty elections this 
October? 
  [Serrano] In my view, if the issue of funds for the unarmed 
political parties is resolved in time, they would be able to 
contribute to the holding of elections in October without the 
shedding of blood. 
  [Alberto] Do you think it is easy or difficult to be the 
leader of a political party in a society like ours which is in 
transition to democracy? 
  [Serrano] My answer to your question is that in Africa we do 
not have political leaders but only public power leaders, which 
are two different things. Answering your question directly, I 
will begin by saying that it is difficult to be a political 
leader because it requires talent, drive, gift, and other 
qualities.

<F P=106> [Report by Robin Drew of the Africa News Service] </F>
  [Text] Harare -- A row between farming neighbours, one 
black and the rest white, has led to a scathing attack by 
President Robert Mugabe on whites in Zimbabwe, whom he has 
accused of still practising racism. Mugabe, who went to the 
Marondera area to tour a black-owned commercial farm, reminded 
whites that they must accept the reality of defeat or else the 
government would take "appropriate measures." These are taken 
to mean appropriation of their land. Mugabe, noting that some 
white farmers had provided decent accommodation and conditions 
of services for their labourers, said thousands of farmworkers 
were still living in squalor. He accused racial bigots of 
practising slavery. He said the process of acquiring land for 
black resettlement had not really started, but added that land 
redistribution was not meant to deprive white farmers of all 
their land. 
  The lone black large-scale farmer complained that his white 
neighbours were hostile and that they alleged a dam on his 
property had not been built properly

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The Nigerian Government has confirmed reports which 
surfaced in Cameroon yesterday of a clash between troops from 
the two countries in the Bekassi Peninsula. The area has been 
at the center of a territorial dispute since late last year when 
reinforcements were sent to the area after complaints that local 
fishermen were being harassed by Cameroonian troops. President 
Biya is even threatening to take the case to the International 
Court of Justice. Today's confirmation of the clashes in 
Bekassi which happened last Friday [18 February] came from 
Nigeria's foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe. On the line to 
Abuja, Valerin Sucker asked him what the latest situation was: 
  [Begin recording] [Kingibe] The situation is rather 
quiescent now and the unfortunate clashes which occurred on 
Friday have been brought under control, thanks to the efforts of 
the two heads of state. 
  [Sucker] So, you don't foresee any more clashes happening in 
the area? 
  [Kingibe] Well, we are doing our maximum best to restrain 
our troops from reacting precipitately to any provocation that 
might again come from the Cameroonian side. What I do now is 
that we have very disciplined regular forces at that frontier. 
They are not these ragtag gendarmes or other paramilitary 
organizations which operate along all sorts of instructions 
which do not conform to what I suppose a well-disciplined 
regular army would recognize and I am sure that on our side, we 
will do our level best to ensure that the incidents such as that 
which occurred on Friday do not recur. 
  [Sucker] Were there any casualties? 
  [Kingibe] The communication and navigation through the 
creeks and canals is so difficult that even under the best of 
circumstances, it will be very tough to start talking about 
casualties. I am sure that if any, they will be minimal and let 
us hope that they are. What is important really is that we have 
gotten beyond the skirmishes. We are now talking dialogue. We 
are now talking peaceful resolution of the dispute that has 
given rise to all this unfortunate situation. 
  [Sucker] You said the two countries are already involved in 
dialogue, but already Cameroon has said it would refer the 
dispute to the International Court of Justice in the Hague. So 
what.... 
  [Kingibe, interrupting] Well, this is what surprises us. 
And well, not only a surprise, but somewhat, I might say 
disappointed that given the nature of the intense dialogue that 
is going on at the very highest level, including regular 
telephone contacts, we are surprised and disappointed that there 
is this introduction of the possibility of a recourse to third 
parties. Of course, the Cameroonian authorities perfectly know 
that neither the United Nations nor the OAU, nor indeed the 
International Court of Justice will compel Nigeria to submit to 
their jurisdiction and quite frankly, the best solution to our 
mutual problem is really the bilateral dialogue. Bringing in 
third parties only complicates issues further, prolongs the 
crisis, and unnecessarily opens some new frontiers, new areas of 
opportunity for all sorts of vested interests and parties which 
may not wish either of us any good any way. So, I am sure that 
the Cameroonian authorities, who might have, in their perhaps 
frustration, just thought any recourse to any forum for the 
resolution of the problem will be considered. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Dakar, 18 Feb (AFP) -- The two main leaders of 
the Senegalese opposition -- Abdoulaye Wade and Landing Savane 
-- were arrested this evening in Dakar, it was learned from 
their entourage. These same sources reported that Mr. Wade and 
Mr. Savane, secretary generals of the Senegalese Democratic 
Party (PDS) and the African Party for Democracy and Socialism 
(PADS), respectively, were arrested at their houses at around 
2100. Their arrest comes 48 hours after violence in Dakar that 
resulted in the deaths of six persons, including five policemen, 
on 16 February, following an opposition rally. 
  Senegalese Interior Minister Djibo Ka said yesterday evening 
that the "incitement to violence" began at a rally organized by 
the Coordination of Democratic Forces (CFD), an umbrella 
organization for five opposition parties, including the PDS and 
PADS. He also stated that "more than 30 demonstrators had been 
arrested" after the riots and that he had been given 
"indications as to the instigators of this criminal act."

  [Text] The two main leaders of the Senegalese opposition 
have been held in custody since yesterday. Abdoulaye Wade and 
Landing Savane were arrested at their homes, and are now being 
questioned on their possible involvement in last Wednesday's 
violence, which caused the death of six people, including five 
policemen in Dakar. The very next day [17 February], Interior 
Minister Djibo Ka said that the meeting organized on the same 
day by the CFD [expansion unknown], a coalition of opposition 
parties, had encouraged violence. Abdoulaye Eliname Kane, the 
communications minister and government spokesman, this evening 
confirmed this version. Among other things, he told Nicolas 
Ballique why the two opposition officials were arrested: 
  [Begin Kane recording] During the meeting, several speakers, 
either directly or by interrupting those who had the floor, 
called on the crowd to march on the palace. The organizers did 
not discourage them. What we fear is that....[pauses] A 
communique says that the organizers understand the 
demonstrators' decision to march to the palace. 
  Given this, I believe that it is the duty of the relevant 
authorities to look for a link between these tragic events and 
this organization. This movement did not come from nowhere. It 
came from the meeting that took place on 16 February on the 
Avenue du General de Gaulle. On the route taken by the 
demonstrators, several instruments were found. The basic 
purpose of these instruments was to kill, to injure, to 
massacre. They rule out the thesis of spontaneity. [end 
recording] 
  Abdoulaye Wade's party, the Senegalese Democratic Party, is 
suspected of involvement. The movement has reacted and 
denounced what it called the continuation of the government's 
drift toward authoritarianism. As for the Muslim organization 
Aira [as heard], Moustarchidines Wal Moustarchidate, which was 
banned by the authorities the day after Wednesday's violence, it 
has denied any involvement in the riots.

  [Text] Abdoulaye Wade and Landing Savane are to remain in 
custody. The detention of the two main Senegalese opposition 
leaders has been extended by 48 hours. As you know, Abdoulaye 
Wade, secretary general of the Senegalese Democratic Party 
[PDS], and Landing Savane, the leader of the African Party for 
Democracy and Socialism, were arrested after the violent 
demonstrations which caused the death of seven people in Dakar. 
It has been announced in the Senegalese capital that other 
arrests may be carried out. The two men are being questioned 
separately by investigators. President Abdou Diouf's government 
is blaming them for the violent incidents. However, Ousmane 
Ngom, the PDS' number two man, told Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou 
that Wade and Savane are being detained under restrictive 
conditions. 
  [Begin Ngom recording] Mr. Wade has been totally isolated. 
He cannot communicate with anybody. He has not been allowed to 
communicate with his wife or his lawyers. He is also not 
allowed to read newspapers or listen to the radio and has 
therefore been totally deprived of information. We have been 
informed that Mr. Savane is being subjected to the same 
treatment. He is being detained under totally unacceptable 
conditions, in violation of human rights and the most 
fundamental freedom. Not only is this arrest arbitrary, it 
appears to be more like a kidnapping because it is difficult to 
understand how a deputy can be arrested without summons or a 
warrant. Also it is difficult to see how the Senegalese 
Government has still not given any reasons for the arrests. We 
are therefore asking for the immediate removal of these 
restrictive conditions as well as the immediate and 
unconditional release of Wade, Savane, and all the other people 
who were unjustly arrested with them. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Togolese have been voting since this morning in 
24 constituencies, where second-round elections have been set up 
to elect parliamentary candidates to fill the remaining seats at 
the National Assembly after the 6 February first round of 
legislative elections. [passage omitted] Voting started a bit 
late following anti-fraud measures taken yesterday by the 
National Electoral Commission. Calm currently reigns at the 
capital's polling centers. 
  Meanwhile, in the interior of the country some incidents 
have 
been recorded. In Haho Prefecture, youths wearing T-shirts that 
displayed Union of Forces for Change logos tried to disperse 
voters and tear up ballot papers. Six polling stations were 
ransacked. During the night of 19 February three [as heard] 
explosions were reported in Kloto Prefecture. There was one 
explosion in the district center of Agou-Gadzepe, where the 
prefect's office was destroyed by a bomb. A second bomb which 
was discovered was defused. In Koumawou, a house next to the 
Gendarmerie building was targeted. There was another explosion 
in Afegame, where a shop was destroyed. In all the above cases, 
only material damage was reported. A fourth explosion was 
reported in Akatse, also in Kloto Prefecture [as heard]. 
  We have also been informed that there was an explosion last 
night in Lome, in Totigan. The explosive was planted under a 
felled baobab trunk tree which had been felled across a street. 
There was no loss of life or material damage. Although there 
were explosions in one district of the capital, as well as 
others in Agou, and incidents were reported in Notse where 
ballot boxes were broken, the climate is fine in Assoli, where 
Kossi Malambani interviewed the area prefect this morning: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified prefect] You must have 
noticed, if you did walk around, that people are lining up at 
the polling stations. There are very long queues. Since we 
are fasting during Ramadan, people got up early and were already 
at the polling stations by 0600. What is holding up voting a 
little is that political party delegates should have signed the 
ballot papers first, and this is has somewhat slowed down the 
voting. 
  [Malambani] To ensure the smooth running of the second-round 
elections, of what measures have been taken this time around, as 
compared with the first round? 
  [Prefect] This time, the people have been well informed, 
especially those who work in the polling stations. Polling 
officers, local electoral commission members, and party 
representatives have all been well briefed on how to receive 
voters and collaborate with their other colleagues. 
  [Malambani] What would you like to say to your people? 
  [Prefect] What I would like to tell the people is that 
voting went on smoothly during the first round. And I would 
like the second-round elections to turn out the same way. I 
would like the people to turn up in massive numbers on election 
day and vote calmly and without any incidents. I would also 
like polling officers to implement our recommendations, they 
should not press voters, voters must be allowed to enter polling 
stations calmly to vote and they must be happy to have performed 
their civic duty when they leave the polling booths. [end 
recording] 
  Also in Lome, Guegue Adjavon managed to interview voters and 
polling officers: 
  [Unidentified polling officer] I have noticed that voters 
are not coming out in sufficient numbers to vote, as was the 
case during the first round of elections. They have certainly 
not been informed. Others have no idea where to go to vote, 
because the second-round elections are not taking place in all 
the constituencies. The people do not know exactly what to do. 
We are waiting for them. [passage omitted] 
  [Second unidentified polling officer] Here the participation 
rate has been a little higher. But I hope that in other polling 
stations where there are second-round elections that the 
participation rate will be the same, that is, as many people as 
possible will participate. What I deplore at this polling 
station -- Massesse I School -- is that His Excellency Herman 
Yameogo, the chairman of the International Followup Committee, 
did not visit this station. I wish he would tour other centers 
to see what is happening there. For the moment, there is no 
intimidation here at this polling station. Everything is going 
on very well, very well indeed, and we are operating under very 
excellent conditions. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Christophe Parayre] </F>
  [Text] Lome, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Togo on Monday [21 February] 
awaited the results of violence-marred general elections amid 
unconfirmed reports that opponents of President Gnassingbe 
Eyadema were only one seat short of an absolute parliamentary 
majority. 
  According to unofficial figures, opposition parties had 
taken 
40 of the 81 seats in the National Assembly after Sunday's 
second round of voting, with only three constituency results 
still to be decided. 
  However, the National Electoral Commission in the small West 
African country failed to release any figures early in the day. 
  Twenty-four of the parliamentary seats were at stake in the 
run- off round of Togo's first multi-party general elections, 
with the opposition sure of taking 12 seats and well placed in 
seven other constituencies. 
  Violent incidents occurred in three of the 11 constituencies 
where opposition candidates were directly up against supporters 
of General Eyadema, who has ruled Togo for 27 years. 
  In the first round on February 6, Eyadema's backers took 35 
seats, against 22 for the opposition. 
  On Sunday, some 30 polling stations in Sokode, 315 
kilometres 
(195 miles) north of Lome, and in Notse, 100 kilometres (60 
miles), were closed prematurely after attacks by gangs of armed 
men. 
  In the evening, a score of polling stations in a Lome 
constituency were raided as officials counted the votes, but 
sources close to the president's office played down the 
violence, declaring that the poll had been largely calm. 
  Both the main opposition leaders, Yao Agboyibo of the Action 
Committee for Renewal (CAR) and Edem Kodjo of the Togolese Union 
for Democracy (UTD) protested about the unrest. 
  "The violence gives us the feeling that the authorities are 
not ready to accept free elections that could lead to an 
opposition victory," Agboyibo told AFP, while Kodjo complained 
of "total disorder" in some constituencies. 
  International observers from Burkina Faso, France, Germany, 
Egypt and the United States acknowledged that the poll had been 
troubled, but the head of the monitoring team, Burkina Faso's 
Hermann Yameogo, said the vote had gone "relatively well" with a 
"good" turnout. 
  In the Haho South constituency in the Notse district, this 
correspondent on Sunday saw electors waiting to vote being 
attacked by armed men who injured two women at one site, and 
fled in a minibus with ballot boxes. 
  Haho South was one of the 11 wards contested as 
head-to-heads 
between Eyadema's Togolese People's Party (RPT) and opposition 
forces led by the CAR. 
  The vote marks the culmination of a troubled transition to 
democracy set in motion in August 1991, and could spell the end 
of Eyadema's 27-year-long monopoly on power. 
  The armed men, who travelled between polling booths in a 
minibus with covered number plates, were wearing T-shirts 
bearing the insignia of the Union of Forces for Change (UFC), an 
opposition party in exile which demanded a boycott of the poll. 
  The UFC's Lome representative denied his party had ordered 
the attacks, which CAR leader Agboyibo blamed on the RPT. 
  The campaign leading up to the run-off round of voting saw 
two bomb attacks and the deaths in a fire of three opposition 
activists, among them a deputy elected to parliament in the 
first round. 
  Under the constitution, the president must designate as 
prime 
minister a member of the party in majority in parliament. 
  The results of the second round must be sent to the Supreme 
Court for official proclamation by midnight Wednesday at the 
latest, and the new assembly will be officially installed on 
March 1.

express its gratitude to the Togolese men and women who have 
just consecrated it, at the end of a multiparty election, as the 
first party of democratic Togo. The RPT is happy about this 
success, which consecrates its service to the nation and the 
thorough work of renewal it has accomplished. As the first 
party of the new National Assembly, it wants to fully play its 
part in the country's government to support the action taken by 
the president of the Republic to redress the country. It hopes 
that after this long transition, the country will settle down to 
work and regain its due position in the comity of nations. 
  The RPT deplores the fact that certain political party 
leaders have tried to disrupt the election through defamation, 
violence and fraud. It calls for the immediate prosecution of 
the defamers and troublemakers. It notes that in several 
constituencies, massive fraud was organized by the Action 
Committee for Renewal. It has confidence that the institutions 
that will have to handle cases of electoral petitions will 
punish the cases of fraud and their authors. Concerned about 
national unity, the RPT wishes to collaborate in renewed 
fraternity with a broad-based union government consisting of all 
those who are ready to contribute their capacities and concern 
to serve to work for national redress under the high authority 
of the head of state.

  [Text] Lome, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Togo's pro-democracy 
opposition claimed Monday [21 February] it had won an absolute 
parliamentary majority following the country's first multi-party 
elections challenging President Gnassingbe Eyadema's monopoly on 
power. 
  Yao Agboyibo, the leader of the Action Committee for Renewal 
[CAR], the main opposition party, told reporters that his party 
and its allies had obtained an absolute majority having won 41 
seats in the 81-member legislature. 
  Agboyibo said that the results from 79 constituencies were 
already known, although the official National Election 
Commission had not yet issued any results from the second round 
poll held on Sunday. 
  Earlier Eyadema's ruling Togolese People's Rally (RPT), 
which 
has helped the military strongman maintain his monopoly grip on 
power since 1967, made charges of "massive fraud" by the 
opposition. 
  In a statement, the RPT called for legal action against 
"certain political leaders," who it alleged had tried to "upset 
the vote by defamation, violence and fraud." 
  Twenty-four parliamentary seats were at stake in the run-off 
round of the elections, with the opposition sure of taking 12 
seats and well placed in seven other constituencies. 
  Outbreaks of violence occurred in three of the 11 
constituencies where opposition candidates were directly up 
against supporters of General Eyadema, who has ruled Togo for 27 
years. 
  Under the terms of the constitution, the victory of the 
opposition, if confirmed, obliges Eyadema to name a prime 
minister from the ranks of the new majority parties. 
  Asked whether he would become the next premier, Agboyibo 
refused to rule it out but said he would beforehand call a 
"round table" meeting of all political parties and 
social/professional groups to get their assent to the 
government's policies. 
  The "round table" would also announce a "general armistice 
covering the opposition and people in power, including the 
military." 
  The armistice would allow the return of civilian refugees 
and 
soldiers estimated to number around 50,000 people, Agboyibo said. 
  The opposition leader added that his becoming prime minister 
would depend upon Eyadema accepting his government's programme. 
  "Cohabiting with Eyadema is the problem. We'll have to 
negotiate the cohabitation," he said. 
  The Constitution demands that the government, responsible to 
the National Assembly, should "lead and determine national 
policy". 
  The head of state signs decrees and orders and promulgates 
laws. He can dissolve parliament but not during the 12 months 
following an election. 
  "Our chief concern is to create a climate of social peace," 
said Agboyibo, adding that he wanted "to see the head of state 
less involved in public affairs". 
  Since Eyadema took power in 1967, he and his followers in 
the 
RPT have maintained an unbroken absolute rule except for during 
the first few months of the transition period started in August 
1991. 
  Agboyibo admitted fears for his security. "There have been 
death threats against me and my deputies," he said, without 
providing any details.

  [Text] Lome, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Togo's pro-democracy 
opposition took a two-seat lead over parties backing President 
Gnassingbe Eyadema in the country's first multi-party elections, 
according to partial official results from a second round of 
polling released late Monday [21 February]. 
  The National Election Commission said opposition parties had 
secured 17 of the 24 seats available in the second round, while 
the pro-Eyadema Togolese People's Rally had won two, and 
transitional Premier Joseph Koffigoh one. The results from four 
remaining seats were not released. 
  The results meant that after two rounds of voting, 
pro-opposition parties had won 39 seats, compared to 37 for 
pro-Eyadema parties, holding out the prospect of an end to the 
monopoly on power exercised by Eyadema since 1967.

<F P=106> [Government communique issued in Lome on 21 February; read </F>
by Georges Combevi Agbodjan, minister of territorial 
administration and security] 
  [Text] The second round of legislative elections took place 
on 20 February in an orderly manner in nearly all the polling 
stations in the 24 contested constituencies. However, acts of 
sabotage disrupted the voting in certain constituencies right 
from the start of voting, during electoral operations at the 
polling stations, or right after the voting booths closed. In 
the Sokode municipality district constituency in the Tchaoudjo 
Prefecture, polling officers were forced to suspend the 
morning's electoral process, close their polling stations, and 
thus block access to polling stations to some voters in Sokode 
municipal district who, in their panic, could not vote for the 
candidates of their choice. 
  In the Haho Prefecture, six polling stations were ransacked, 
ballot boxes were broken, and ballot papers were scattered about 
before the start of voting. Some ballot boxes were stolen away 
right after the polling stations closed before the votes could 
be counted. What became of these ballot papers? In the fifth 
district of Lome municipality, incidents were recorded in some 
polling stations. Armed men prevented the counting of votes, 
especially in Aflao-Toshivi and Batome. Armed gangs caused 
panic in several polling stations, thus forcing voters to return 
home without performing their electoral duties. 
  In Wawa Prefecture the review of electoral reports and vote 
counting were suspended when armed gangs broke into the office 
of the Gbalou Prefectoral Council, where the local electoral 
commission was holding a working session. Election papers were 
taken out and burned and electoral commission members 
terrorized. These unfortunate and anti-democratic incidents 
have certainly influenced the manner in which voters cast their 
votes in the said constituencies, where a number of voters were 
unable to vote. 
  Under these conditions many voters could not freely and 
properly exercise their voting power. They were simply 
prevented from doing this and the ballot papers of those who 
were able to vote could not be counted before the announcement 
of the results. Those who commit these unacceptable acts of 
intolerance in a state where there is a the rule of law, 
compromise the fragile basis of our young democracy. 
  In any case, it is up to the competent authorities to 
question the validity of the voting that was carried out in the 
affected constituencies.

  [Text] The new package of constitutional amendments have 
been presented to the multiparty negotiating council in Kempton 
Park by the government and the ANC [African National Congress], 
who said the amendments were aimed at addressing the concerns of 
the Freedom Alliance and enhancing the legitimacy of the interim 
constitution. The tabled amendments confirm earlier versions of 
the constitutional concessions announced last week. The 
proposals include concessions on self-determination to address 
right-wing demands for a volkstaat [homeland]. These are 
supplemented by a proposal that a volkstaat council be 
established by members of Parliament to pursue the concept of a 
volkstaat after the election. No members of the Freedom 
Alliance attended this morning's meeting of the negotiating 
council. The concessions will also allow provinces to write 
their own constitutions and to create their own legislative and 
executive structures. A two-ballot system is also proposed.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] only responded today to the mediators' proposal 
-- one day after the deadline. UNITA has only accepted one of 
the 18 suggestions made by the mediators. For UNITA the only 
point worth considering for Angolan reconciliation is a national 
campaign through the media. Maria de Lourdes Lopes reports from 
Lusaka: 
  [Lopes] The debate on national reconciliation continues. 
UNITA responded today to the draft document on specific 
principles presented by the mediators and by the observers. In 
18 points, UNITA clarified what, in its opinion, should be done 
to achieve national reconciliation. UNITA only used one of the 
mediators' suggestions -- the one advocating a media campaign to 
help pacify tempers. UNITA's response comes one day after the 
deadline set by the mediators. 
  On Tuesday [15 February] morning, when the government's 
delegation handed in its response, UNITA said it needed time to 
study the draft presented by the UN mediators. Alioune Beye 
gave UNITA until the end of Friday afternoon, but the meeting 
set for yesterday did not take place: UNITA wanted more time. 
Today it gave its answer. In the 18 principles it puts 
forward, UNITA dedicates one to its own statutes as the main 
opposition party. Another pertains to the security of its 
leaders. According to a source from the negotiations, who 
declined to give any further details, UNITA also proposed a 
public competition to chose the Republic's symbols. The 
mediators and the observers are already working on the 
documents. Tomorrow morning they are expected to present a 
proposal on specific principles, including the sugestions from 
both sides.

  [Text] Lagos, Feb 18 (AFP) -- A Cameroonian delegation, led 
by Deputy Foreign Minister Francis Nkwain has held private talks 
with General Sani Abacha in the Nigerian capital, a reliable 
source close to the presidency told AFP Friday [19 February]. 
  The delegation which delivered a special message from 
President Paul Biya to Abacha Thursday in Abuja, is believed to 
have discussed current border difference between the two 
countries with the Nigerian authorities, said the source. 
  Since the beginning of this year when Nigeria sent 500 
troops 
to its border with Cameroon, currently under dispute, the West 
African nation, has maintained a low profile, bordering on 
complete silence on the issue. 
  Press reports Friday here quoted the Nigerian defence 
headquarters as warning journalists against focusing on the 
issue as such information might likely jeopardise current peace 
efforts to resolve the conflict. 
  A Lagos-based independent newspaper Thursday reported the 
deployment of about 1,000 additional Nigerian troops to the 
affected border area on Wednesday.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] A security situation in the self-declared territory 
Somaliland is becoming a cause of increasing concern to the SNM 
[Somali National Movement] Government. In spite of an ultimatum 
to renegade militias to hand in their weapons, many have set up 
their own checkpoints to extort money from travelers and last 
night, an armed attack is reported to have taken place on the 
residence of Somaliland's President Mohamed Egal. On the line 
to Hargeysa, Raggi Omar asked the president what actually 
happened. 
  [Begin recording] [Egal] What happened.... [pauses] I will 
tell you exactly what happened. You know, this is Ramadan now. 
People usually stay up late at night, you know, and some young 
ex-militia who had had a very pleasant night and a lot to drink, 
much more than was good for them, were driving in this kind of 
car and, as they were passing the street before the president's 
house, you know, the residence, one of them fired a shot at the 
gate. The bullet went through the gate and grazed, just grazed, 
one of the guards who were standing next to the gate, and then 
they were chased and four of them were arrested and one of them 
was arrested next morning. 
  [Omar] So what you are saying is that an attack took place, 
but it is not as serious as might seem to be the case. 
  [Egal] They were just five young boys, you know, who had had 
too much to drink, and as they were passing.... They really did 
not come here to attack us. They were just passing along the 
road. One of them, as they were passing the gates of the 
Presidency, fired the shot. 
  [Omar] But some people might interpret it as being very, 
very 
serious because, as you say, the five men were ex-militias. You 
have been launching a campaign to demobilize and decamp the 
militias which are still out on the streets of Hargeysa and 
other towns in Somaliland, and some of them have been very 
unhappy about these efforts by you. Could there not be serious 
sort of, you know, political undertones to the attack? 
  [Egal] No, I am afraid that is exactly what it is not. You 
know, there were these young chaps who did not come here to 
attack. There was no concerted and planned attack on the 
Presidency. It was just these young boys passing along the 
street and as they were passing one of them fired that shot and 
then they ran away. Of course, we are in the middle of this 
demobilization and disarmament, but it is not being done against 
the will of anybody. We are doing it through persuasion, 
through dialogue, through peaceful means. There are people who 
describe themselves as opposition here. I do not know what they 
are opposing. We are now trying to knit together a very, very 
delicate fabric of a nation which has been completely destroyed. 
  [Omar] So you will continue to demobilize these soldiers 
from 
mounting these custom posts and taking money off people at 
checkpoints and you will be sleeping very comfortably at the 
Presidency this evening without worry? 
  [Egal] Yes, I had been sleeping last night and all the 
nights 
before that and I am going to sleep very comfortably tonight, 
too. People might call me a bloody bastard but they will not 
shoot at me. [end recording]

  [Text] The Tanzania Government has refuted press reports 
that 61 soldiers out of its contingent of about 800 soldiers who 
are in Liberia for a peace-keeping force mission have died. The 
minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation, the 
Honorable Joseph Rwegasira, who was in Liberia for a three-day 
visit, told journalists in Dar es Salaam that the reports which 
were carried in some private local media were baseless. He said 
contrary to the reports, he found all the soldiers healthy and 
in high spirits, apart from only one soldier who is hospitalized 
following a leg injury in a football match. He said Tanzania's 
move of sending its soldiers to Liberia was a move of 
implementing the Cotonou Accord brokered by Economic Community 
of West Africa States, ECOWAS, OAU and the United Nations that 
called for, among other things, an expanded peacekeeping force 
to include peacekeepers from Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.

  [Excerpt] Karamojong elders and Kraal leaders have assured 
President Museveni of their readiness to make peace with their 
neighbors. At a meeting held in Kaparabyong and chaired by 
President Museveni, the Karamojong, through their 
representative, Mr. Philip Ichumal, who is also the Resistance 
Council [RC] Three chairman for Namalu, expressed their 
gratitude to the pacification committee which is sensitizing 
them on how to live peacefully and harmoniously with their 
neighbors. Mr. Ichumal assured the president that the 
Karamojong will ensure that all guns are handed over to the 
vigilante force in Moroto within two weeks. He said that they 
will also go and tell their fellow Karamojong, in other areas 
never to come with guns to the neighboring districts. Mr. 
Ichumal also appealed to the government to facilitate the 
pacification committee with transport so that it can coordinate 
interaction easily between the Karamojong and their Teso 
neighbors at all levels of the community so that there is 
permanent peace in the region. He said that constant contact is 
necessary to help iron out hostilities. He also expressed 
confidence that education is necessary to help Karamojong to 
change their behavior. He asked the government and the Teso 
people to forgive the Karamojong for the wrongs committed to the 
neighboring communities. 
  President Museveni, in his remarks, stressed the need to 
have 
the program supported by Karamojong as well as all other people 
in their neighboring districts to help the government alleviate 
the suffering of the people in the region. The president also 
urged Ugandans to support the formation of the vigilance group 
in Karamoja because they are already doing a good job in the 
phasing out of illegal guns in Karamoja. He therefore urged all 
Karamojong with illegal guns to join the vigilance force, which 
is like LDUs [local defense units] in other areas, adding that 
government will consider some incentives for the vigilantes. 
Mr. Museveni also said that he is ready to visit Karamojong 
Kraal leaders who, he said, need to be educated on how to keep 
cows cost-effectively and get earnings from their herds. 
  President Museveni addressed a public rally at Kaparabyong 
County headquarters, where he commended the people of Teso for 
rejecting insurgency. He said that this will help government to 
tackle the problem of illegal guns still in Karamojong hands. 
He said that the government will ensure that the Karamojong 
become law-abiding citizens. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Today is the third and last day of the general 
warning strike launched by the Gabonese Trade Union Federation 
[COSYGA] on 16 February. Like yesterday, the COSYGA, its 
affiliated unions, and sympathizers went on peaceful marches 
throughout the country today followed by a sit-in in front of 
the premises of Channel One of the radio and television 
corporation. It was however reported that at Port Gentil, the 
march ended with incidents leading to the arrest of COSYGA's 
three provincial leaders. Albert Effam confirms this from the 
economic capital. 
  [Begin recording] Paul Henri Yelo M'Boungana, COSYGA's 
provincial secretary for Ogooue-Maritime Province, was arrested 
today together with three other trade unionists following this 
morning's peaceful march organized by the COSYGA. The four men 
were detained in the early afternoon in the jails of the 
Gendarmerie in central Port Gentil. No official reason was 
given for these arrests. Questioned on these arrests by Radio 
(Mountie), the local officers of Port Gentil gendarmerie simply 
indicated that they were obeying orders and asked us as to 
enquire from the offices of the state attorney. Another 
explanation gleaned piecemeal from a source close to the 
gendarmerie indicated that the arrest of Paul Henri Yelo 
M'Boungana and his comrades could be the consequence of the 
incidents that marred this morning's march, especially the 
littering of the roadway with household garbage, the stopping of 
buses transporting some workers, and the deflation of tyres of 
stationary vehicles. 
  According to latest reports, the Ogooue-Maritime union 
leader, Paul Henri Yelo M'boungana and his comrades were picked 
from the Gendarmerie by the Army and taken away in a military 
vehicle to an unknown destination. COSYGA's activists and 
sympathizers went to the governorate to seek an explanation in 
the late afternoon but Governor (Antoine Abia Gueyangoe) of 
Ogooue-Maritime Province was in a meeting. [end recording]

  [Text] Kigali, 22 Feb (AFP) -- The installation of the 
transitional Parliament and broad-based government, scheduled 
for this afternoon, has been postponed indefinitely following 
last night's assassination of the public works minister, it was 
learned from many sources here. A spokesman of the UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda had indicated late this morning 
that the installation of the transitional institutions was still 
scheduled despite the assassination of Mr. Gatabazi, who was 
shot dead close to his house. The installation of these 
institutions should have taken place in early January, under the 
terms of the peace accord signed last August after three years 
of civil war.

  [Text] A communique from the Office of the President 
broadcast in Kigali has just announced the setting up of the 
transitional institutions this Wednesday, 23 February at 1000. 
The president of the Republic announces that he was obliged to 
take the measure since the political parties, he says, have not 
come to an agreement, and the country is slowly plunging into 
insecurity. 
  How will the decision, which must have been motivated by the 
extent of the demonstrations which followed the assassination of 
the secretary general of the Social Democratic Party, the late 
Felicien Gatabazi, be viewed by the parties concerned. To get 
an answer, we must wait for their reaction, in particular that 
of the prime minister designate to lead the transition, Faustin 
Twagiramungu. The head of state declared that he was waiting for 
a visit from the Rwandan prime minister-designate to discuss the 
program for the setting up of the institutions tomorrow.

  [Text] Following the increasing insecurity noted recently 
[words indistinct] the assassination last night of Minister of 
Public Works and Energy Felicien Gatabazi, the town of Kigali is 
practically a ghost town this 22 February 1994. Markets 
remained closed, and shops in the commercial area have not 
opened, public and private offices are almost completely 
paralyzed. 
  The increased insecurity began on Sunday [20 February] when 
unidentified elements barricaded the roads leading to the 
Nyamirambo regional stadium in order to hinder the holding of an 
Republican Democratic Movement meeting organized by Faustin 
Twagiramungu, who is the president of the party. The insecurity 
was aggravated yesterday afternoon when members of the CDR, 
Coalition for the Defense of the Republic, practically occupied 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, barring all 
access to it by road. 
  The CDR wants to obtain the code of ethics documents that 
every political party has to sign in order to take part in the 
transitional institutions. As we shall see later, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation claims not to possess the 
documents. The security forces have been able to clear the area 
around the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have freed about 40 
employees who had been detained as hostages.

  [Text] Kigali, 23 Feb (AFP) -- Tribal clashes broke out 
sporadically here overnight as preparations went ahead for the 
swearing-in of parliament and a transitional government 
containing former rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). 
Witnesses said they heard gunfire, and that RPF soldiers, who 
are predominantly Tutsi, were fighting residents of the majority 
Hutu tribe in Kigali. 
  A spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda said 
however that its troops always accompanied RPF men, and he could 
not confirm that former rebels were involved in armed incidents. 
Humanitarian agency sources said there had probably been 
casualties in what they described as "very localised" clashes, 
but most of the capital was calm, they added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Following the assassination of Minister Felicien 
Gatabazi, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party 
[PSD], the members of the PSD in the Butare zone and the 
surrounding area, the prefecture which Minister Gatabazi came 
from, have decided to organize peaceful demonstrations for three 
days. That is to say, today and Wednesday they will demonstrate 
peacefully while Thursday will be the day of the burial. The 
demonstrations will end each day at 1700. 
  PSD officials in Butare promised the security council of the 
prefecture that they would safeguard the security of people and 
goods. However, this was not the case this morning, when some 
people had their vehicles taken away by the demonstrators, who 
used them to block the roads. In Butare town, shops and markets 
are closed. Some services are not functioning normally.

  [Text] What effect will the assassination of Felicien 
Gatabazi have on the setting up of the transitional 
institutions? It is difficult to say for the time being despite 
the promises of the president of the Republic but one thing 
seems certain. Apart from the assassination of a fierce 
opposition leader, the killing of the Social Democratic Party 
secretary general has another objective: To sabotage the 
setting up of the transitional institutions planned for today. 
As you know, the ceremony did not take place today. How can 
one imagine the ceremony taking place in an atmosphere of 
mourning? 
  Who has an interest in seeing the setting up of the 
transitional institutions postponed? Three names come to the 
mind of the least attentive observer: First, Liberal Party 
Chairman Justin Mugenzi, for well-known reasons. He would like 
to impose his deputies on the National Assembly but has met with 
opposition from people, like the late Gatabazi, who defended 
democracy. Second, there is the National Republican Movement 
for Democracy and Development [MRND] which is pulling strings 
behind Mr. Mugenzi and has an interest in supporting him. 
Finally, there is the Revolutionary Democratic Council, 
Coalition for the Defense of the Republic, the MRND's ally, 
whose pretext for sabotaging the establishment of the 
transitional institutions is because they were denied a seat in 
the Transitional National Assembly. 
  So many parties for one reason or another could have acted 
to 
prevent the establishment of the transitional institutions. 
None of them have never hidden this desire and they would like 
to sabotage the setting up of transitional institutions and the 
disappearance of late Gatabazi could be advantageous in this. 
May his soul rest in peace.

  [Text] Etienne Tshisekedi's government says it is indignant 
at and preoccupied by the repeated incursions into Haut Zaire 
Province by Sudanese Government Armed Forces. According to 
Tshisekedi's government, the incursions are allegedly being 
carried out with the complicity of Marshal Mobutu's Special 
Division. This has caused a sudden rise in tension in this 
region. Here is Christian Obadi Bangi, the deputy minister of 
external relations in Tshisekedi's government, who comments on 
the military maneuvers in the region. 
  [Begin Bangi recording] The legal government deplores this 
military cooperation between the Zairian Armed Forces and units 
of the Sudanese Government Army. This cooperation, which 
typifies this association of evildoers, must be condemned by the 
international community. The government notes that soldiers of 
the Zairian Armed Forces visited the districts of (Nasco), Koya, 
(Mori Boye), and Yambio in southern Sudan. Escorted by their 
Sudanese counterparts, the Zairian soldiers looted livestock -- 
cattle, goats, and sheep -- in the zones under the control of 
southern Sudanese People's Liberation Army. 
  In turn, the Sudanese soldiers were authorized to penetrate 
into Zairian territory at Iri, (Botiama), Malembo, Owele, Rumu, 
(Kargai di Baze) and (Kpori) in the Ituri District. They stole 
foodstuffs from businessmen in the Haut Zaire Province and 
kidnapped young girls to Sudan under the escort of their 
accomplices from the Zairian Special Presidential Division. 
  The legal transitional government of the Republic of Zaire 
vehemently condemns this barbarous behavior and calls on the UN 
High Commission for Human Rights to form an international 
commission of inquiry to establish the responsibility of each 
side in this case. [end recording]

elections in Cape Verde, took place 19-20 February in the Cape 
Verdian capital and solidified the divisions within the party, 
resulting in the departure of the former labor and justice 
minister, Eurico Monteiro, and several other leaders. 
  Monteiro had contested the way the chairman of the MPD was 
designated and announced that he would create a new party. 
Among the new leaders of the MPD are Communication Minister 
Ondina Ferreira, Territorial Administration Minister Mario 
Silva, Fisheries and Agriculture Minister Helena Semedo, and 
National Assembly Speaker Amilcar Spencer Lopes. 
  The divisions within the MPD began several months ago with 
the resignation of the ministers of foreign affairs, justice and 
labor, and health. The first two blamed the prime minister for 
having kept in place the Cape Verdian ambassador to Portugal, 
who was accused of using government funds for personal use. 
  The former single party, the African Party for the 
Independence of Cape Verde [PAICV], in power for 17 years, 
demanded the holding of early elections due to the crisis within 
the MPD. 
  The PAICV has 22 deputies at the National Assembly compared 
with 56 for the MPD.

  [Text] Interior and Security Minister Alseny Rene Gomez has 
just returned from a visit to the Forest-Guinea Region where he 
noted rebel incursions into some Guinean villages. It has 
therefore become necessary for certain measures to be taken 
including the beefing up of security along the border to stop 
any further incursions. Foreign Minister Ibrahima Sylla 
confirmed this to Mamadou Ba Diabate. 
  [Begin Sylla recording] Guinea has taken very strong 
measures. Security at our borders has been greatly beefed up -- 
much more than before -- since the last incidents. Obviously, 
the National Defense Council has adopted other confidential 
defense measures that will be implemented if necessary. Of 
course, the humanitarian aspect must still be considered since 
we owe a humanitarian duty to the refugees there who are only 
asking for peace. However, it is necessary for all of us -- 
governors, refugees, and local authorities -- to work towards 
the same objective: that of calming the situation since the 
actual process of restoring peace in Liberia has started. [end

  [Text] Bamako, 18 Feb (PANA) -- The government of Mali 
announced here yesterday evening that it has ordered the "arrest 
of a number of persons" and the "closing down" of a private 
radio station under "conservation measures" aimed at preserving 
public order. The measures were decided after violent 
demonstrations by pupils and students shook the Malian capital 
on 15 February. Four persons, including a gendarme, were 
injured, and there was considerable material damage. 
  These troubles have led the Malian Government to close down 
the country's educational institutions "until further notice," 
and to order the arrest of those suspected of instigating the 
revolt. The identities and number of persons arrested have not 
been given. The government did, however, announce that it had 
ordered the closing down of Radio Kaira," a private FM station 
that broadcasts in the Bamako area. 
  The radio is said to have close ties to the National 
Committee for Democratic Initiative, an opposition political 
party that recently withdrew its three ministers from the 
government. On 15 February, it opened its studios to 
demonstrators, who seized the opportunity to call for another 
gathering the following day. It also denounced the "kidnapping" 
by "two unknown persons" of a student leader, who was receiving 
treatment in a Bamako hospital. Unauthorized marches and 
demonstrations have been going on regularly in Mali since the 
advent of democracy in March 1991, and it has cost the state 
about 100 million CFA francs to maintain order, according to 
some sources.

<F P=106> [By Ade Obisesan] </F>
  [Text] Lagos, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Cameroonian paramilitary 
police have burned down more than 30 Nigerian villages and 
displaced thousands of people from disputed border territory in 
the past two months, the Nigerian military has charged. 
  The commander of Nigerian troops in the disputed Bakassi 
peninsula, General Wotomi Diriyai, said the Cameroonian 
gendarmes have killed or injured many Nigerians and seized their 
fishing boats and nets, the official NAN news agency reported 
Tuesday [22 February]. 
  But defence spokesman General Fred Chijuka on Tuesday 
stressed that "Nigeria is not in a state of war, neither is the 
country for now thinking of a war, with Cameroon." 
  Diriyai told journalists in Calabar, capital of the 
southeastern Cross River state, that property estimated at 
hundreds of millions of naira belonging to fishermen and 
traders, in an address on Monday. 
  Chijuka said that diplomatic discussions were under way at 
highest level between the two countries over the disputed 
peninsula, which is rich in fish and oil, making plans for a war 
"unnecessary." He also denied that Nigeria has placed its 
soldiers stationed in the area "on a state of alert for war" and 
expressed the hope that the differences could still be resolved 
peacefully. Nigeria has no "expansionist ambition," but if 
negotiations failed, the government "may have to study other 
alternatives," Chijuka said, refusing to disclose what these 
were. 
  The Nigerian troops in the area would remain there "until 
the 
intentions of Cameroonians are properly put in place", Chijuka 
said. He denied reports that Nigerian troops were the first to 
attack Cameroonian security forces last weekend. "Nigerian 
soldiers were on routine patrol before they were attacked by 
Camerounian gendarmes who shot at our patrol boats", he said. 
The Nigerian soldiers, who have been instructed not to attack, 
merely turned back and reported the incident to their 
headquarters, he said. 
  Cameroon last Sunday stated that Nigerian soldiers attacked 
its forces, and that its troops immediately repulsed the attack. 
  Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Baba Gana Kingibe said 
late 
Monday in the federal capital Abuja that "if there were any 
skirmishes, these must have been on provocation from the 
Cameroonian side and our troops must have responded in 
self-defence". 
  Diriyai's statements were the first time since 1981 that 
official Nigerian comment has been made on reported human and 
material losses sustained as a result of raids by Cameroonian 
security forces. 
  Seven Nigerians died in 1981 following an attack by 
Cameroonian gendarmes on Nigerians living in fishing villages in 
the disputed area, an incident which angered public opinion. 
  For the first time since the dispute began, the military 
authorities gave journalists a map they said delineated the 
border between the two nations. The demarcation, drawn above 
Rio-del-River in the south, ceded the disputed peninsula to the 
Nigerian side. 
  Since late December, when the Nigerian authorities sent 500 
soldiers to the disputed area, the government has kept largely 
quiet about its handling of the matter. 
  The editor of a local newspaper who reported last Wednesday 
that Nigeria sent about 1,000 additional troops to the disputed 
area was called in by the army and "warned seriously" against 
publishing such news in future because of its security 
implications, a top military officer told AFP.

  [Text] Freetown, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Thirty young Sierra 
Leonean suspected guerrilla trainees have been arrested in 
neighbouring Guinea and extradited to Freetown, where they were 
jailed, diplomatic sources said here Tuesday [22 February]. 
  The 30 men, who were caught last Thursday with guerrilla 
training manuals in their possession, were repatriated under 
heavy military guard and placed in a high security prison. They 
had been on their way to Libya, the sources added. 
  Sierra Leonean officials here refused to comment on the 
reports. 
  The military junta in power since April 1992 has been facing 
rebel insurgency in southeastern Sierra Leone. After making 
amnesty offers, it in January declared "total war" against Foday 
Sankoh's guerrillas.

  [Text] Lome, 22 Feb (AFP) -- Dozens of young people began a 
demonstration in Lome late this morning to demand the 
cancellation of the legislative elections in the fifth 
constituency of the capital where an opposition candidate won 
the seat in the second round of the elections. The 
demonstration took place while opponents to President Gnassingbe 
Eyadema yesterday claimed an overall victory in the elections 
and affirmed that they had won the absolute majority of seats in 
the National Assembly. 
  The Interior Ministry later denounced irregularities in five 
of the 81 constituencies concerned -- including Lome -- by 
implicitly suggesting the cancellation of the vote in those 
constituencies where the opposition won all the seats, according 
to unofficial sources. 
  The demonstrators were not wearing any distinctive signs to 
show their political affiliation. After crossing Adewui 
district, in the north of the administrative and commercial 
center of the city, they commandeered five vehicles and began 
roaming the streets chanting: "We Demand Justice. There Is Too 
Much Fraud. Cancel The Elections Right Now. If They Are Not 
Canceled, We Will Break Everything." 
  About 20 policemen and gendarmes arrived on the scene 
shortly 
after 1100, an hour after the demonstration started. They 
negotiated with the young people, seized the vehicle keys, and 
rounded them up without any brutality near the market. 
  At 1130, a man, who seemed to be leading the demonstration, 
tried in vain to calm down his comrades who continued to chant 
their slogans. He was dressed in a blue overall and the blade 
of a hatchet was sticking out of his pocket. 
  Questioned by AFP, a police commissioner present at the 
scene 
said the young people should not be arrested because "it could 
to a degeneration in the situation. We should try to reason 
with them," he said. 
  By midday, the young people were still demonstrating and the 
Adewui district inhabitants slowly came out of their homes to 
join in the demonstration. In neighboring districts, streets 
were empty and shops were closed. Two jeeps with a dozen French 
and Burkinabe observers on board kept their distance from the 
demonstration.

<F P=106> [By Christophe Parayre] </F>
  [Excerpts] Lome, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Togo's former sole ruling 
party, loyal to President Gnassingbe Eyadema, officially called 
Tuesday [22 February] for the annulment of several election 
results as it apparently faced defeat at the polls. Panou 
Koffi, spokesman for the pro-Eyadema Togolese People's Rally 
(RPT) explained the decision by saying "People were prevented 
from voting" in Sunday's second, run-off round of general 
elections. 
  The opposition coalition meanwhile claimed victory, 
declaring 
that had taken at least 42 of the 81 parliamentary seats, which 
would compel General Eyadema to choose a prime minister from its 
ranks. But the smaller opposition party, the Togolese Union 
for Democracy (UTD) warned that it would quit the new parliament 
if results were annulled in five constituencies where the RPT 
has accused its rivals of violence and vote-rigging. [passage 
omitted] 
  The national electoral commission has announced that the 
opposition had taken a two-seat lead over Eyadema's supporters 
with 39 to 37, with the outcome known in 77 constituencies. 
  Former transitional premier Joseph Koffigoh, who stood as an 
independent, also won a seat in the West African country's first 
multi-party polls, but it was not clear which way he would lean. 
Imposed on Eyadema in 1991 by a national conference to pave the 
way for multi-party democracy, Koffigoh was subsequently accused 
by opposition parties of falling into the camp of Togo's ruler. 
  The election results contested by the government concern a 
seat officially said to have been taken by the opposition and 
the four constituencies where the outcome had yet to be 
announced. On unofficial figures, the opposition was said to 
have won all four. 
  "If there is an annulment, the UTD will pull out of the 
game," Ajavon Ata Messan, secretary general of the party and its 
candidate in a Lome constituency contested by the government, 
told AFP. "It won't take part in anything, in any case not the 
new national assembly," he added. On official results, the UTD 
has so far won six seats. [passage omitted] 
  Electoral commission chief Garba Sipophon on Tuesday said 
the 
body would deliver its findings in the evening to the Supreme 
Court, the sole authority empowered to rule on the validity or 
the annulment of votes. 
  The Burkinabe head of an international team of election 
monitors, Hermann Yameogo, said he would "not be astonished" if 
the court decided to annul some results. 
  The interior ministry denounced "regrettable and 
anti-democratic incidents," declaring that "a number of voters 
were not able to make their choice freely." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Results of the second round of the 20 February 
parliamentary elections are now being disclosed. Twenty of the 
24 contested seats have been won. The opposition parties are 
leading with two seats more than the Rally of the Togolese 
People [RPT]. [passage omitted] 
  The opposition is already claiming victory. On 21 February, 
Mr. Yao Agboyibor, Action Committee for Renewal chairman, said 
that his party and allied groups of the Togolese Union for 
Democracy had won the absolute majority in the future National 
Assembly. The Togolese Government immediately disputed the 
results of the second round of elections in several 
constituencies where it claims the elections were marred by acts 
of sabotage. The former sole ruling party, the RPT, has adopted 
a similar position and is even going a step further by calling 
for the annulment of the elections in the constituencies where 
it claims there was fraud. Gachin Ayite Midevor, who is in 
charge of coordination for RPT and the election campaign, speaks 
to Raphael Mbadinga on the issue. 
  [Begin recording] [Midevor] At the moment, we are still 
awaiting results from four constituencies. The RPT has issued a 
statement on our readiness to cooperate in a broad sense with 
the opposition in the next government. We have also noticed 
that there was fraud in certain constituencies and we have 
referred the matter to the Supreme Court. We are calling for 
the annulment of elections in the constituencies where there was 
fraud. 
  [Mbadinga] Are you ready to accept a prime minister who is 
chosen from the ranks of the opposition? 
  [Midevor] Our Constitution stipulates that prime ministers 
are chosen from the parliamentary majority. If the 
parliamentary majority turns out to be from the opposition, we 
cannot oppose that. [end recording]

  [Text] The peace talks are evolving in leaps and bounds in 
the Zambian capital. Significant progress has been made at 
talks on national reconciliation. Despite this, the Luanda 
regime and the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, oppose the much desired peace for 
Angola. The communists, led by Eduardo dos Santos, use the 
talks to resort to Machiavellian practices to make the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] disappear 
from the Angolan political scene, beginning with the 
assassination of UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi and 
other UNITA officials. 
  This was, at least, what MPLA-PT ideologue Lucio Lara said 
in 
Strasbourg, France, four days ago, and UNITA will be protesting 
to the United Nations about such underhanded and barbarous 
views. UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim 
has had this to say about it: 
  [Begin Valentim recording] The UNITA team to the Lusaka 
peace 
talks has rejected with repulsion the remarks made against UNITA 
President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi and other UNITA officials 
by MPLA baron Mr. Lucio Lara, who is a deputy to the National 
Assembly on behalf of the party currently in power in Angola. 
Coming as they do at a time when national reconciliation is 
being discussed, Mr. Lara's remarks put the Lusaka peace talks 
at great risk. The UNITA team to the Lusaka talks cannot 
believe that the talks will go well if the government fails to 
clarify its real intentions. It would be naive for UNITA to 
believe in national reconciliation while gallows intended for 
UNITA officials are being put in Luanda. The UNITA team to the 
Lusaka peace talks intends to protest energetically to the 
mediation and the observers on this matter. [end recording]

  [Text] The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola 
[MPLA] says the government delegation will not accept any of the 
demands made by the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] in its latest proposals. MPLA Information 
Secretary Joao Lourenco says Savimbi men's proposals are absurd. 
There will be no power sharing. 
  [Begin recording] [Lourenco] UNITA proposals are completely 
absurd. It is going too far. As a party which lost the 
elections and afterward seriously violated the law by taking up 
arms and setting the country alight, it cannot make the demands 
it is making in Lusaka today. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] How far is your statement true? 
Are you not saying this just to calm down your voters? 
  [Lourenco] No, this is not just aimed at calming down our 
electorate. We think it is a serious issue which must receive 
due importance. We think it would be a bad precedent not only 
for future elections in our country but also in other African 
countries, particularly southern African countries. What UNITA 
should do is to try to win a future election, and it will be 
able to head the sectors it has mentioned. If this does not 
happen, it cannot make such demands. There is no international 
body which can force us to accept UNITA's demands because we won 
the elections. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The loss of the strategic city of Soyo continues 
to be the cause for major headaches for the team led by acting 
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who is now about to 
begin a visit to France. Reports reaching the Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel news desk say that the acting 
president will be meeting the French authorities to discuss ways 
of overcoming difficulties currently facing oil exploitation in 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA]-controlled city of Soyo. No one knows what those ways 
might be. What is known is that Soyo currently represents a 
daily loss of $12 million. 
  To France, the paralyzation of Soyo prevents the payment of 
the crude oil that had already been sold but not exploited. A 
source in Paris has said that Luanda will be forced to use the 
money it makes from Cabindan oil sales to pay what it owes 
France, even if does so only in token symbolic installments. 
That source was also doubtful about the Popular Movement for 
the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party's [MPLA-PT] capacity to 
repay part of its debt in the present conditions, with 
everything looking set for war. That source added that the 
MPLA-PT's debt is now in excess of $12 billion. 
  All this is happening at a time when mercenary deals appear 
to be more difficult to enter into. The South African market is 
disappointed, because the mercenaries who fought in Soyo in 1993 
did not receive the money they had been promised in terms of the 
contracts they signed, in addition to footing a very bloody 
bill. Captain (Brooks), a former member of the South African 
special forces, commanded the operation in Soyo in 1993 and he 
saw his companions killed one by one in the Soyo jungle, now the 
resting place of Commander (Piel Smit), a Rhodesian war veteran, 
and Commander (Frank Taljaard), in addition to some 100 
(?assorted) mercenaries. 
  So, the head of the Futungo de Belas Palace is faced with 
these problems as he travels to France, a country that has 
already made its position clear: It wants to assist the 
mediators and help the economy become viable in a climate of 
peace. This position was made public by the Paris Club last 
weekend and, according to an African diplomat, it did not go 
down well with the Futungo de Belas leadership. That diplomat 
explained that Luanda wants to buy more war materiel and it has 
not excluded the possibility of securing the services of some 
French mercenaries, if it can get permission from the government 
led by Francois Mitterrand. For all intents and purposes, this 
is already the first defeat the Luanda warlord has suffered in 
his visit to France. [passage omitted] 
  Paris wants war to stop in Angola, so it has made it public 
that it will put pressure on Eduardo dos Santos to adopt more 
flexible stands in Lusaka. In short, Angola's acting president 
will not be received with the honors usually bestowed on a head 
of state. In terms of the French Constitution, no election 
candidate can be received as head of state. That is precisely 
the situation of the man from the Futungo de Belas Palace. His 
high-level contacts are to be few and far between. [passage 
omitted] 
  French diplomats feel that this is not a good time for 
acting 
President Eduardo dos Santos to visit France, a diplomatic 
country that does not like the fact that the MPLA-PT has been 
stepping up the war in Angola.

  [Text] Reliable sources have told the Voice of Resistance 
of the Black Cockerel that the involvement of a number of 
Namibia Government circles in military and logistical assistance 
to the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola was 
yesterday discussed at a meeting Lopo do Nascimento [secretary 
general of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] 
held in Windhoek on 19 November. Lopo do Nascimento was in 
Namibia to discuss military cooperation. 
  Last week, the governor of Jamba said the Namibian 
Government 
had installed a Soviet-made radar system along the border with 
Angola. 
  Asked to comment whether those developments posed a threat 
to 
the region's stability, a source with the General Staff of the 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola said: We will 
continue to follow a policy of good neighborliness. We will not 
interfere in the domestic affairs of sovereign governments, 
though provocations will never be tolerated. The source urged 
the Namibian people not to allow circles in the Government of 
Namibia to plunge their country into a senseless war.

for about 10 minutes, but nothing was reported to the media. 
  Masaki Konishi, the new Japanese ambassador to Angola, also 
handed in his credentials this afternoon. He was introduced to 
some government officials, followed by a champagne toast to 
salute newly found friendship and cooperation. This was the

  [Text] Blantyre, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Malawi's Defence Minister 
Wilfred Mponela has disclosed that 2,730 of the country's feared 
Young Pioneer force, recently disbanded, are in neighbouring 
Mozambique, emerging from a civil war. 
  Major General Mponela said that military sources in 
Mozambique had indicated that the Pioneers are in camps held by 
the formerly rebel Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo), the 
semi-official DAILY TIMES reported Monday [21 February]. 
  The new figure contradicts a previous official version of 
between 200 and 500 Pioneers still unaccounted for. 
  Michael Chimutu, the head of the disbanded Pioneers, long 
considered a private army operating for Malawi's ageing 
President Kamuzu Banda, last week told journalists and diplomats 
that 500 Pioneers remained unaccounted for. 
  Minister of State John Tembo often puts the figure at 200. 
  Mponela, who officially retired from the army on Friday and 
was appointed defence minister in December after a 30-year 
career, said the disarmament of the Pioneers, codenamed 
Operation Bwezani (Return), will continue because "the nation 
wants peace." 
  He said the army will ensure that May 17 general elections 
are held in a peaceful atmosphere. The army will not be allowed 
to vote in the first free poll since independence in 1964 to 
prevent it from being divided into factions. 
  "Soldiers cannot vote because they are non-partisan," 
Mponela 
stated, according to the DAILY TIMES. 
  The chairman of the disarmament committee, Lieutenant 
General 
Mankin Maulana, last week expressed the military's concern that 
arms retrieved from the Pioneers do not tally with inventories. 
  Malawi and Mozambique have agreed to cooperate in the 
repatriation of the Pioneers. Banda's government was officially 
neutral in the Mozambican civil war that followed independence 
in 1975 and ended with a peace pact in October 1992.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] In Malawi, the multiparty elections, of course, are 
taking place in May, in about three months' time, but opposition 
parties are still unhappy. Their latest concerns are about the 
activities of the Young Pioneers, the 4,000 strong paramilitary 
youth wing of the Malawi Congress Party. These Young Pioneers 
used to terrorize people who did not support President Banda. 
Two months ago, the Army started an operation to dissolve the 
Young Pioneers, one way of ensuring, of course, that the 
elections will be fair. Now they have captured many of their 
weapons, but cannot account for a good number of the Young 
Pioneers. Well, the opposition isn't impressed. It believes 
many Young Pioneers fled to Mozambique and will return soon in 
secret to disrupt the election. On the line to Malawi, Fergus 
Nicoll with opposition leader Mr. Bakili Muluzi of the United 
Democratic Front. How many Young Pioneers are still in 
Mozambique? 
  [Begin recording] [Muluzi] Well, according to the 
information 
we have, people have talked about over 1,000 MYP [Malawi Young 
Pioneers] who actually crossed over to Mozambique, but then the 
Malawi Government came up and said no, they are not 1,000, they 
are 350, 250. Even if there were 50 or there were 20 MYP's 
armed in Mozambique, still, that to us it is of great concern. 
Why should they run away with weapons to Mozambique, I mean 
what for? The question of actually disarming them was to try 
and bring stability in Malawi because we think that these 
people, that is the MYP, have been a source of intimidation, a 
source of causing problems to our security in this country. 
  [Nicoll] While on the run up, of course, to elections 
scheduled for May, are you concerned at this time that any more 
activity, let's say by the Young Pioneers, might jeopardize 
those elections? 
  [Muluzi] We in the opposition are definitely saying that we 
would like to have a peaceful election. I think Malawi needs 
that. We all definitely want to do that, but we are saying that 
if the MYP's are left armed as they are, armed as they are in 
Mozambique or wherever they may be, even in the country, that is 
definitely going to cause a lot of concern to us, because we 
think that they will be definitely prone for a lot of 
intimidation to our people. They will do anything to actually 
cause confusion during the election, which we don't want to 
happen, and we would want therefore that the elections to be as 
peaceful as possible. 
  [Nicoll] So, do you think that it is time for the Army to 
step in again, or is there an alternative tactic that you would 
like to see the government use? 
  [Muluzi] What we are saying is that, naturally, the rule of 
the disarming of the MYP is in the hands of the police and the 
Malawi Army. What we are saying is that we want the Army to 
continue to be looking around for those people who are holding 
any weapons. There are now negotiations between Malawi 
Government and Mozambican Government to the effect that those 
people who are in Mozambique should return to Malawi before the 
elections, and we want that happen as soon as possible so that 
the run up to the elections should be peaceful. 
  [Nicoll] People who have visited Malawi in the last few 
years 
have been commenting that the atmosphere of the general sense of 
freedom of expression and freedom of opinion has really been 
very widespread now and people are really enjoying that. Do you 
see any threats to that in the current situation over the months 
ahead? 
  [Muluzi] Oh yes, generally things have changed in Malawi in 
terms of people expressing themselves freely, but we in the 
opposition feel that this kind of change can be temporarily 
until the general election actually takes place on 17 May. We 
feel that if government does nothing in trying to disarm the 
Malawi Young Pioneers, they can use that as intimidation to our 
people, and therefore the question of people expressing 
themselves freely and things of that type would seem a temporary 
kind of thing, which we don't want to happen, because we think 
that the transition and also what has happened during the 
referendum, and also after the referendum should continue, 
should be irreversible. The change must be irreversible, you 
know, in order for the people to enjoy the freedom that is there 
now. [end recording]

  [Text] Teodato Hunguana, the government's number two man on 
the Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, told Radio 
Mozambique today that the reduction of UN forces in this country 
must occur hand in hand with the coming into being of the new 
armed forces. Reacting to the UN Security Council's plan to 
reduce the UN peacekeeping forces in Mozambique, Teodato 
Hunguana noted that the UN contingent is in this country to 
carry out a mission which will be over when the Mozambique 
Defense Armed Forces, FADM, have started operating. Teodato 
Hunguana said that to withdraw or reduce those forces before 
their mission is over could have negative consequences for this 
country. 
  In turn, Jeronimo Malagueta, Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] political affairs officer, says that Renamo is not 
against the United Nations reducing its contingent, as long as 
this occurs simultaneously with the arrival of a UN police 
contingent.

Zambezia Province, and Chiramba, in Sofala Province -- currently 
have more than double the forces initially supposed to stay 
there. 
  Unomoz also reports that more than 37,000 men had turned up 
at the various troop assembly areas by yesterday. Of those, 
some 27,000 are government soldiers and more than 10,600 are 
Renamo troops.

to forbid other political forces from doing political work in 
Renamo-controlled areas. 
  Speaking to the Radio Mozambique's correspondent in 
Quelimane, (Domingos Jambe), Frelimo provincial secretary for 
organization and mobilization, condemned what he described as 
the prevailing one-party system in areas under Renamo's control. 
(Jambe) said that it was dishonest for Renamo to do its 
political work with impunity in government-controlled areas 
while preventing other parties from doing the same in its areas.

  [Text] The permanent secretaries of State House and the 
Cabinet will now attend Cabinet meetings and a number of other 
secretaries have been promoted. This decision was taken by 
Cabinet during its Fifth Ordinary Session on February 15, and 
was yesterday announced by Nguno Wakolele, the permanent 
secretary in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. 
  The former permanent secretary at State House will now be 
called secretary to the President, and will have an equal rank 
with that of secretary to the Cabinet. Eddie Amukongo, who now 
holds that position, has been acting secretary to the Cabinet. 
Wakolele said the former deputy permanent secretary at State 
House, would now be deputy secretary to the President. That 
post was held by Dr. Ndeutala Hishongua. The post will be the 
equivalent to a permanent secretary and its holder will be the 
accounting officer at the Presidency. 
  The permanent secretary in the Office of the Prime Minister 
will now be deputy secretary to the Cabinet but still keep the 
first position. Dr. Peingeondjabi Shipo holds that position. 
  The acting permanent secretary for Home Affairs, Shetu 
Hamunyela has been confirmed as permanent secretary. He has 
been acting in that position since the relocation of Frieda 
Williams to the Ministry of Works, Transport and 
Telecommunication as permanent secretary. 
  Explaining the reasons for the changes, Wakolele said the 
permanent secretaries to State House and the Cabinet were 
serving in sensitive positions and should be able to attend 
Cabinet meetings. Only the deputies would not be allowed to 
attend. 
  In addition, the permanent secretary to State House could 
receive delegates should the President not be present, he said. 
  The changes had been planned since December last year. The 
changes had nothing to do with an individual, said Wakolele, 
responding to a question on whether they had anything to do with 
the transfer of former Permanent Secretary to the Cabinet Petrus 
Damaseb, as Namibian Representative to the Joint-Administrative 
Authority.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Constitutional Development Minister </F>
Roelf Meyer in Johannesburg on 22 February] 
  [Text] The constitutional negotiations were completed and 
the constitution passed by Parliament in December 1993. Since 
then further attempts have been made to ensure the participation 
of the Freedom Alliance (FA) parties in the transitional process 
and the April elections. This was done in order to seek a 
settlement on outstanding constitutional differences and to 
achieve amendments to the constitution while there was still 
time to do so before the elections. 
  This was done through trilateral talks involving the 
government, the Freedom Alliance and the African National 
Congress (ANC) from the beginning of January to early February. 
No final result could be achieved during this time on account 
of: 
  1. The uncompromising stances which some of the parties 
adopted on various issues. 
  2. The fact that the FA parties excluded themselves from the 
multiparty negotiating process during the second half of last 
year when the constitution was actually drafted. Thus they were 
not aware of, and eventually lacked understanding of, the 
compromises reached during these negotiations, as reflected in 
the text of the constitution. 
  3. The absence of a single negotiating position on the part 
of the FA. At no stage during negotiations were they able to 
present a uniform position or arrive at a final decision 
whenever a possible breakthrough was imminent. 
  4. At no stage did the FA have sanctioning from their 
respective principals, and they had to refer back to their 
principals constantly, leading to delays, interruptions, 
inconclusive meetings, and the frequent changing of agendas. 
  5. The government had to deal with the different points of 
departure of individual negotiators in the FA. There were the 
solution-orientated, and those who were obviously not prepared 
to seek solutions. 
  A final attempt to reach trilateral agreements was made on 3 
February 1994, when government presented their package of 
proposed amendments that could have led to an agreement ensuring 
participation by the FA. The FA initially reacted positively to 
these proposals, but were not prepared to bind themselves 
finally to any solution on that basis. 
  Since the trilateral talks had failed to bring about a 
settlement, the government had to take a different route. That 
was to go forward and amend the constitution in Parliament with 
the co-operation of the negotiating council. The ANC was 
approached and agreed to such a process. The negotiating 
council was subsequently convened on 21 February 1994 to 
consider and approve the package of proposals. 
  The package of proposals consisted of the following: 
  1. The amendment of Section 126 of the constitution which 
deals with the powers and functions of provinces. The reference 
to concurrency has been deleted in order to make it absolutely 
certain that the laws passed by the provincial legislatures will 
prevail over laws passed by the national parliament on matters 
listed in schedule 6 to the constitution, except for overrides 
already provided for and previously accepted by the FA. 
  2. The amendment of sections 155-159 of the constitution to 
strengthen the taxing competence of provinces. This was 
previously agreed to by the FA. 
  3. The amendment of section 160 of the constitution to 
enable 
provincial legislatures to include specific provisions in their 
own constitutions regarding their own legislative and executive 
structures. This will, for example, enable the province of 
kwaZulu/Natal to make special arrangements for the position of 
the Zulu monarchy. 
  4. The amendment of constitutional principle XVIII to 
provide 
that the powers and functions of provinces, as set out, will not 
be diminished in the final constitution. This effectively means 
entrenchment of this most critical provincial provision, 
according to the FA. No constitutional principle can be changed 
after the election, even by a 100 percent majority in Parliament. 
  5. Changing the name of the Province of Natal to 
kwaZulu/Natal. 
  6. Adding an additional constitutional principle on the 
subject of self-determination, including the possibility that it 
can be exercised in a territorial entity, if constitutionally 
agreed. Provision is also made by amending chapter 11 to create 
a mechanism for conducting further negotiations on the subject 
of a volkstaat [homeland] for those who really want it. 
  7. Amendments to the Electoral Act to provide for two ballot 
papers, one for the national assembly and one for the provincial 
legislatures and for the extension to 4 March 1994 of the date 
for parties to register for the elections. 
  All these amendments have now been approved by the 
negotiating council and will be put before Parliament for 
deliberation next week. This is a complete package that in fact 
addresses all the concerns that were raised by the FA. There is 
now nothing to keep them from participating in the elections. 
For the sake of our country's future we can only hope that 
reason will now prevail.

and of communication

  [Text] The government's chief negotiator, Mr. Roelf Meyer, 
says the new constitution has the support of 85 percent of the 
electorate, and the democratic process cannot be held up. 
Speaking after a tour of Soweto and Noordgezicht, Mr. Meyer 
said the government would have to take care in protecting the 
electoral process, so that every party and every voter could 
participate freely. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Conrad Burke] A little 
battle of the bands greeted Mr. Meyer when he opened the 
National Party's [NP] Dube office, but the ANC [African National 
Congress] supporters' protest was drowned out by the NP's drums. 
Mr. Meyer said it was the first time in history that a NP 
cabinet minister had campaigned in Soweto. 
  [Meyer] The fact that we are here is proof of free political 
participation by all, especially also by us as the NP in Soweto. 
  [Burke] Then the NP flag went through the streets of Soweto. 
At the Mafolo community center Mr. Meyer underwent the ritual of 
traditional healers. It was described as an act of 
reconciliation, to introduce the NP to the ancestors. It was a 
small gathering, but there was some voluble support. 
  [Unidentified NP supporter] I'm going forward with the NP. 
I'm dying for the NP. I am not scared. I'm a mother of 59 
years, but I'm still Johnny Walker. I'm still strong. 
  [Burke] A short snack at a roadside mealie [corn] store, and 
the entourage visited the colored community of Noordgezicht. 
The people here took to the Meyer charisma. One of the 
highlights of the tour was the signing up of the NP's oldest 
supporter, Mr. Niklaas Amsterdam, on his 107th birthday. 
Addressing newsmen here, Mr. Meyer touched on the 
constitutional road ahead. 
  [Meyer] We have every reason, first of all, to go ahead in 
ensuring that we proceed with the democratic process on the 
basis of a valid constitution, and secondly, to enable all 
parties and every individual in the country to participate in 
the elections. I believe we have all the right to do so. [end

<F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 21 SAPA -- The multiparty 
negotiating council convened at the World Trade Centre in 
Kempton Park after a three-month interval on Monday without the 
Freedom Alliance parties to pass amendments to the interim 
constitution. The amendments to both the interim constitution 
and to the Electoral Act provide for greater taxation powers for 
provinces and guarantees that powers granted now will not be 
taken away once a constituent assembly sits after the April 
elections. 
  They also provide for the establishment of a "volkstaat 
[Afrikaner homeland] council" to propagate a volkstaat within 
the constituent assembly. The Electoral Act amendments provide 
for a double ballot and the extension of registration for the 
April elections until March 7. The amendments are due to be 
passed by Parliament next week. 
  Several delegates questioned whether the council was going 
far enough in meeting the alliance's demands for exclusive 
powers. Others criticised the amendment on a volkstaat. 
  Ciskei's Mickey Webb said the amendments could be "too 
little, too late". 
  Answering his criticism, African National Congress Secretary 
General Cyril Ramaphosa said he doubted it was too late. He 
said Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had said 
that even if his demands were met he would not participate in 
the election because it was too late to start campaigning. 
  He said the alliance's negotiating tactics made him doubt 
whether they had ever been serious about taking part in an 
election in the first place. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said that while Section 126 of the constitution 
was not being amended to create exclusive powers for provinces, 
other provisions meant their powers were exclusive even if the 
term was not used. He claimed the alliance had constantly 
changed the goalposts in trilateral negotiations on the issue of 
exclusive powers. 
  He said that even as late as midnight on Monday, the ANC had 
been asked by the alliance to amend Section 126 in a new and 
different way. He said the alliance was being offered a 
provision that powers granted would not be taken away. "These 
powers all amount to exclusive powers because the provincial 
governments will take the initiative in passing legislation on 
these issues," he said. An amendment to Section 126 would have 
been superfluous. 
  "We do have exclusive powers for provinces. The word 
exclusive is not used, but when it is looked at closely they are 
exclusive." 
  Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer said no 
reformulation of Section 126 was acceptable to all three parties 
involved in the trilateral negotiations. He said he had asked 
the alliance for specific proposals on Section 126 but had 
received none. Mr Meyer said that while negotiations with the 
alliance could continue, Monday was the last chance for 
amendments to the constitution. 
  Answering criticism on the provision of a mechanism for the 
attainment of a volkstaat, Mr Meyer said a volkstaat could not 
be in conflict with provisions of the constitution guaranteeing 
fundamental human rights.

  [Text] Should Anyone Walk Away From The Elections? You Be 
The Judge. 
Our proposals to address the fears of those who feel their 
needs have not been met: 

  -  Voters to cast two votes (one for national 
representatives; one for provincial representatives); 
  -  Provinces to largely control their own finances; 
  -  Provinces to determine their own legislative and executive 
structures; 
  -  A constitutional principle on self-determination providing 
for 
consideration of a volkstaat [homeland]; 
  -  Elected provincial representatives to decide on the name of 
their province; 
  -  Provincial powers not to be undermined when the Constituent 
Assembly drafts the new constitution. 

    The ANC [African National Congress] is firmly committed to 
peace and democracy. Since the beginning of negotiations, we 
have always listened to other points of view. Our aim remains 
an inclusive settlement that has the support of all parties. 
  We believe that our latest proposals remove all reasons for 
anyone to stay out of the elections. Of course, we recognise 
the right of any party or individual not to take part. But no 
one has the right to disrupt the elections. 
  The elections will be held on April 27. And South Africa 
must remain a united nation. We have made concrete proposals. 
We have negotiated in good faith. A negotiated settlement is 
the only option for South Africa. The door is still open. 
  A better life for all. Working together for jobs, peace and 
freedom.

  [Text] Re: The Inkatha Freedom Party's Stance on the 
Election 
  We owe it to you to explain exactly where we stand in this 
moment of crisis. Propagandists have sought to portray our 
party as intransigent, unreasonable and constantly shifting the 
goalposts. Sadly, those making such claims are strangers to the 
truth and are gambling with our country's future. 
The facts are as follows: 
  The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] has always negotiated on the 
basis of written documentation -- from Codesa [Convention for a 
Democratic South Africa] on. Unfortunately, our eminently 
reasonable submissions were totally ignored at the Kempton Park 
talks. We walked out in protest on 2 July 1993. 
  We then engaged in bilateral and trilateral negotiations 
with 
the Government and ANC [African National Congress] and have 
continued to do so. Our final proposals were contained in a 
document of 19 December 1993, known as the "yellow paper" which 
incorporated our proposed constitutional amendments placed on 
the Order Paper of Parliament. 
Far from shifting the goalposts, we have in fact constantly 
reduced our demands. 
  No proposal over and above those contained in the yellow 
paper have been advanced. Our negotiators have shown 
flexibility, departing from principles and positions in the 
yellow paper. This is particularly the case with regard to the 
powers of provinces, their fiscal autonomy, the role of the 
Senate, provisions of rationalisation, the deadlock-breaking 
mechanisms, matters relating to provincial civil services and 
police, the functions of local government and more besides. 
  The National Party could not sell these reasonable proposals 
to its partners in the ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party] 
alliance, with whom it had struck a deal. Indeed, negotiations 
broke down on a clear and cynical ultimatum tabled by SACP 
chairman, Mr Joe Slovo. He said the IFP and the Freedom 
Alliance had to accept two conditions, or further negotiations 
would be futile. 
  These were: 

  -  that provinces could have no exclusive powers; and 
  -  that a Constituent Assembly would have absolute power to 
determine the powers, functions and boundaries of provinces. 

    The latest "offer" by the ANC and NP [National Party] 
government changes little, since both organisations again refuse 
to deal with the core objections we have to the interim 
constitution. 
  My fellow South Africans, my party cannot, in conscience, 
accept this state of affairs. 
  Constitutions are not drafted to last for a few months or 
years. The constitution of the greatest democracy on earth, the 
United State of America, has endured for over 200 years. 
Constitutions are not there to look to the interests of parties 
in power -- they are there to protect individuals and minorities 
against the abuse of power. 
  The National Party government and the SACP/ANC alliance have 
placed self-interest above the country's interest in negotiating 
deals to suit themselves. That is not the way to secure our 
country's constitutional future. 
  What we want as a precondition to securing the well-being of 
all our people is very simple. We want federalism and we will 
continue to fight for it. We promise that once this is 
achieved, we will work day and night for a free and fair 
election to secure true democracy for every individual in this 
great country of ours. 
  That is the task my party and I have set ourselves. We will 
not rest until the job is done.

  [Text] The search for a constitutional settlement is still 
bogged down after the negotiating council -- after further 
concessions -- still could not succeed in involving the Freedom 
Alliance in the coming election. 
  The negotiating council in its session at Kempton Park 
approved a package of concessions by the government and the ANC 
[African National Congress] and also conceded, among others 
things, to the extension of the nine provinces' powers. Inkatha 
Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi insisted that the 
concessions did not satisfy the alliance's objections. Gary 
Alfonso reports: 
  The negotiating council in Kempton Park approved amendments 
to the interim constitution which, according to the government 
and the ANC, met the demands of the Freedom Alliance. In a 
special concession the word "concurrent" was removed from the 
constitution, which means that the central government may not 
interfere with provincial powers, except when it was in national 
interest. That, Dr. Buthelezi said, was not enough. 
  [Begin Buthelezi recording, in English] The powers of 
regions 
or provinces as defined in the present constitution are equal to 
the powers of municipalities, when you talk about abattoirs and 
gambling as such. To say that when you have not given real 
regional powers in the first place, to say that you have now 
removed... [pauses], you are not going to interfere with that -- 
it's neither here nor there, in fact it's nonsense. [end

<F P=106> [Report by G. Rogers] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria Feb 22 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini on Tuesday told President F W de Klerk he was not 
dependent on multiparty approval for the recognition of a 
sovereign Zulu kingdom. He was "simply claiming it". He said 
he and his people would resist the election, which was being 
forced on them. 
  Addressing Mr de Klerk at the start of their meeting in 
Pretoria, the king said the impasse between the government and 
kwaZulu had begun when Mr de Klerk had pandered to the African 
National Congress and had ignored the call for a delegation from 
the Zulu monarchy to be included in the multiparty talks. 
  In a copy of his remarks sent to SAPA, King Zwelethini said 
furthermore that the Zulu people would not be satisfied with the 
area north of the Tugela River, as had been suggested by some 
analysts. The Tugela boundary between what was Natal and the old 
Zululand was established by colonialism and not by history. 
Great Zulu generals of the past and some of the larger Zulu 
clans had come from south of the river. "In fact...our great 
founding king, King Shaka...lies buried south of the Tugela. 
Most of my subjects live in the area south of the Tugela." 
  King Goodwill said any constitutional clauses, "any interim 
authority and any legislation which denies the reality of the 
Zulu kingdom is for me not worth the paper it is written on". 
The interim constitution did not even allow even for "a kind of 
homeguard" to protect the Zulu kingdom's integrity, and the 
"vaunted powers of provinces" were "glorified municipal powers". 
  "This we will not accept." 
  The king said he was not waiting until after the elections 
to 
clarify issues that were impeding the emergence of a sovereign 
Zulu kingdom. "The only thing we can talk about, Mr. President, 
is how the Zulu kingdom will be relating to the new South Africa 
which will emerge from the politics of people elsewhere." 
  He said their talks should be about how the administrative 
structures of the Zulu kingdom and South Africa could be 
mutually beneficial, how to rationalise them and how to remould 
them into what they should be. "My father's people will resist 
the election which you and political South Africa are attempting 
to force on us. 
  "It will be folly in the extreme to think that the election 
tank and the constitutional tank of the World Trade Centre 
and...parliament can roll over and flatten opposition to 
constitutional developments now taking place. 
  "I am not dependent on any multiparty approval for the 
recognition of the sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom. I am simply 
claiming it." 
  An earlier statement by a government spokesman said the 
necessity of assuring the proper recognition and constitutional 
accommodation of King Goodwill and the kwaZulu kingdom had been 
discussed at the meeting. The spokesman said after the 
three-hour meeting the two sides had agreed to extend the 
mandate of their joint working group to give urgent 
consideration to all aspects of this question and to report back 
as soon as possible. 
  Mr de Klerk was accompanied by ministers and senior 
officials. King Goodwill was accompanied by Inkatha Freedom 
Party President and kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
and members of the kwaZulu royal family.

<F P=106> [Report by G. R. Linscott] </F>
  [Text] Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi of kwaZulu says 
he is not dismayed by the prospect of losing office by staying 
out of the April election. Interviewed at Ulundi, he said he 
would continue the political struggle using his traditional 
power base as chief adviser to King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
  "My leadership was not built up by the homelands policy. 
I'll be part of the struggle -- my king, myself and my people." 
He was not prepared to speculate as to tactics. But he said 
the outlook was bleak. 
  The mood of people on the ground was ugly -- "I've never 
known it like this before" -- and it could get worse and become 
difficult to control. He said he was not responsible for 
keeping the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] out of the election -- 
it had been forced on him by the Government and the ANC [African 
National Congress], which refused to consider federation as an 
option. 
  The logical next phase was the king's demand for the 
restoration of the Zulu sovereignty of 1834. "When they 
rejected the federal option and could not accept our amendments, 
I was disarmed in my relationship with the King. There was 
nothing I could say to him. I had not delivered on self-rule." 
  He said it was pointless to participate in elections for a 
non-federal dispensation, something he had worked for for 20 
years. The Buthelezi Commission and the kwaZulu/Natal Indaba 
[meeting] had been rejected. And the IFP's contribution to 
constitutional negotiations had been rejected. In 1910 the 
whites were fooled. They were bluffed by Smuts that they were 
going to get a federation, but in the end there was no 
federation. We're not prepared to walk that road. I can 
understand that whites are concerned at us staying out of 
elections but they have to appreciate that for my people it is 
nothing new. We never had the vote before. Nothing much has 
changed. 
  "I don't know why the Government and the ANC reject 
federalism. It is a democratic way to protect the interests of 
regions and minorities. What's wrong with the system in 
countries like the United States, Germany, Canada and Australia?" 
  He denied being a secessionist. "I refused to take 
independence because although we went into Union kicking and 
screaming, history has made us South Africans. We don't want to 
be deprived of that." 
  The king's stand had been forced by events, he said. It was 
now out of his own hands as chief minister. Asked whether it 
was feasible for elections to be held in Natal/kwaZulu without 
IFP participation, and whether a subsequent government could be 
effective, Buthelezi declined to speculate. "That is their 
problem, not mine."

  [Text] South Africa is moving closer to being a respected 
member of the African community. Today for the very first time 
a secretary general of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] 
arrived in South Africa on an official visit. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Linda van Tilburg] The OAU 
has been watching political developments in South Africa closely 
for decades. Now they're keeping an even closer watch on 
political developments here as observers during the country's 
first multiracial election. There are 15 here at present, but 
there will be more than 200 before the elections. On his 
arrival at Jan Smuts Airport, the OAU current secretary general, 
Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, underlined the continent's concern about 
the forthcoming election. 
  [Salim] Africa is following these elections very closely, 
and 
there is going to be a very impressive, massive African presence 
during elections -- whether they come from the Organization of 
African Unity, whether they come from the Commonwealth, or 
whether they come from the United Nations. 
  [Van Tilburg] During his four-day visit Dr. Salim will meet 
leaders of the government, the ANC [African National Congress], 
PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], Inkatha Freedom Party, and the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front]. Although he wouldn't 
elaborate, it is expected that he might try to convince General 
Constand Viljoen and Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi to 
participate in the election. 
  [Salim] It is absolutely essential that all should be 
involved in the process of election. 
  [Van Tilburg] Dr. Salim today said there would be massive 
support for South Africa's membership of the OAU. It's expected 
that South Africa will for the first time become part of the 
33-year-old organization shortly after a government of national 
unity is formed. [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 23 SAPA -- African National 
Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela told visiting Organisation 
of African Unity [OAU] Secretary-General Dr Salim Ahmed Salim on 
Wednesday [23 February] not to underestimate the threat the 
right-wing posed to the election process. 
  Speaking at a joint press conference, Mr Mandela told 
reporters their meeting had been short because he had a "very 
important" appointment in Pretoria at 10.30 AM. He would not 
divulge further details. 
  Referring again to his meeting with the OAU chief, Mr 
Mandela 
said he had stressed to him that dialogue was the ANC's most 
important weapon in dealing with the right-wing. 
  Dr Salim said the OAU would enhance its team that will 
observe the April elections. 
  Mr Mandela said: "If there's one organisation that has fully 
supported our struggle, it's the OAU."

<F P=106> [Report by Kevin Davie] </F>
  [Text] Who will be the Minister of Finance after April 30? 
  Opinion polls and candidate lists suggest that Nelson 
Mandela 
will be State President and F.W. de Klerk and Cyril Ramaphosa 
his deputies. Finance Minister is the next most powerful 
position. Many in business see Derek Keys as the automatic 
choice, but ANC [African National Congress] indications are that 
this is by no means certain. 
  ANC leaders say they would like Mr. Keys in the cabinet of a 
government of national unity, but as Minister of Trade and 
Industry, not Finance. Would Mr. Keys take the relatively 
junior position? Many think not. 
  The ANC is shopping for a suitable candidate. Outgoing 
Nedcor [expansion unknown; a major financial institution] chief 
executive Chris Liebenberg is said to have been approached. But 
Mr. Liebenberg is believed to have declined because he does not 
have political ambitions. Senior ANC people fancy Thabo Mbeki 
for the job. But there are suggestions that Mr. Mbeki may be 
reluctant to occupy the hot seat at this stage of his career. 
  What are the ANC objections to Mr. Keys? He has, after all, 
done a very good job under extremely difficult circumstances. 
There are mutterings that he is too authoritarian and not 
sufficiently in tune with the need for investment in human 
development. He is also said to be too strongly associated with 
the National Party for a senior job in the cabinet. Others say 
powerful ANC members, such as Jay Naidoo, who fancies himself as 
Minister of Reconstruction, do not want Mr. Keys controlling the 
purse strings. One cannot easily imagine Mr. Naidoo telling his 
voters that he would like to spend, spend, spend, but Mr. Keys 
won't let him. 
  Can Mr. Keys live with the ANC's reconstruction and 
development programme (RDP)? He says it should be subject to 
discussion with interested parties in the National Economic 
Forum, including government departments. 
  Opinion polls show Mr. Keys is the favourite among business 
people. Agenda-Sacob-Weekly Mail polled 100 businessmen and 
found 89 percent support for Mr. Keys as Finance Minister. 
  ANC economics head Trevor Manuel polled a lowly 4 percent. 
Mr. Manuel, 20th on the ANC's election list, and Tito Mboweni 
(32nd) are not in the running for top jobs, although deputy 
ministerships are possible. 
  A complicating factor in Mr. Keys' case is that on the 
latest 
polls the NP will get five cabinet posts, including Deputy 
President. With provincial leaders first in line and the NP's 
senior negotiators also in with a claim, there are not many 
cabinet posts to go around. There is unlikely to be a lot of 
"after you" going on in the scramble for jobs. 
  Ultimately, the choice of Finance Minister will be made by 
the new President. He will undoubtedly listen closely to his 
party and to business. One scenario is that Mr. Mbeki will not 
be given a cabinet position, but will be in the President's 
office with overall responsibility for implementing the RDP. 
This would open the way for Mr. Mandela to appoint Mr. Keys 
Minister of Finance. He is, after all, so far ahead of the 
others on the election lists that this is a one-horse race.

  [Text] There has been strong reaction to statements this 
weekend by the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] that all land will 
be confiscated for redistribution. A spokesman for the National 
Party, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, said in a statement that 
this ignores economic realities. Mr. Errol Moorcroft of the 
Democratic Party described the statements as utterly 
irresponsible and said it is proof that the PAC is out of touch 
with reality. He said such a policy would destroy the economy 
and permanently damage South Africa's ability to feed its people. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Andries van Zyl] In 
Bloemfontein, the Orange Free State Agricultural Union [OFSAU] 
attacked the PAC over its land policy. The union said PAC 
President Clarence Makwetu's statement on the possible 
resumption of the armed struggle to ensure land redistribution 
is looking for trouble. 
  [OFSAU President Dr. Piet Gouws, in English] I think it is 
about time that somebody says to Mr. Makwetu: Listen, the PAC 
and no other force in South Africa will force the farmers off 
their land. [as heard] 
  [Van Zyl] Referring to voter recruitement among farm 
laborers, Dr. Gouws said he is aware of some Free State farmers 
who allow only a certain political party on their farms, while 
the African National Congress is prohibited. 
  [Gouws, in Afrikaans] As far as I am concerned, it is 
totally 
immoral. One either allows every one to campaign or no one at 
all, for security reasons or whatever. But this is something 
we cannot condone at all. [end recording]

arrested by security staff after pointing and firing a toy 
pistol at President F W de Klerk's passing election motorcade. 
He stood on a street corner in Postmasburg, went down on one 
knee in a firing position, and pulled off several shots at the 
motorcade as it passed. 
  Security men accompanying Mr de Klerk on his two-day 
election 
tour turned round and arrested him and confirmed to SAPA later 
that he would be charged. "He is lucky our snipers were not on 
that corner," a senior policemen said. "He could have been 
killed before it was established it was a toy pistol." 
  Mr de Klerk addressed about 200 supporters outside 
postmasburg city hall before a lunchtime address to a further 
200 National Party guests inside.

  [Text] Ulundi Feb 17 SAPA -- A senior kwaZulu cabinet 
minister and top Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] official has 
resigned from active party politics and has left the kwaZulu 
capital of Ulundi, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
radio news reported on Thursday. Chief Simon Gumede was 
minister of works and deputy secretary-general of the IFP. 
  He was also a member of the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly and 
the IFP Central Committee as well as president of the Federated 
Council of Indigenous Rulers of South Africa. 
  Chief Gumede's name appeared on a pamphlet listing 21 
alleged 
African National Congress activists within the kwaZulu 
administration. Nongoma College Registrar Thabiso Ngubane, whose 
name also appeared on the list, was shot dead at the weekend. 
  Announcing his departure, Chief Gumede said his decision had 
not been influenced by the distribution of the pamphlet. He had 
instead decided to serve his Gumede clan in the Ubombo area in 
northern Zululand and would remain a member of the IFP. 
  KwaZulu Chief Minister and IFP President Chief Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi said it was sheer coincidence that Chief Gumede's 
resignation had come at the same time as the distribution of the 
pamphlet. He said he had not suspected Chief Gumede of being 
disloyal. 
  The ANC [African National Congress] has disassociated itself 
from the pamphlet and has asked the Transitional Executive 
Council to investigate the matter. Several people were attacked 
and their houses gutted after a similar document was circulated 
in Ulundi last year.

<F P=106> [By Craig Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Newcastle Feb 22 SAPA -- Orde Boerevolk [Order of 
the Boer Nation] member Leonard Veenendal says he is prepared to 
go to war for an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] and is training 
Zulus to militarily defend themselves against an African 
National Congress [ANC] "onslaught". "If it means going to war 
to keep what is mine, then we'll go to war." 
  The prominent rightwinger, who is also the officer 
commanding 
of the Northern Natal Boerekommando said in an interview in 
Newcastle on Tuesday: "It's no secret that we're training 
them... We have trained them offensively". 
  Newcastle ANC leader Mandla Cele said he was aware of 
training sites in the district and had requested the 
Transitional Executive Council to act against them. 
  Mr Veenendal, who described himself as the Orde Boerevolk's 
chief of staff, would not reveal the camps' whereabouts or 
details, and refused reporters access to them. "We can not rule 
out the possibility of war. We're preparing for war," he said 
at a rightwing rally in Newcastle on Tuesday. 
  Earlier, he marched into the local ANC offices and delivered 
to a surprised Mr Cele a declaration claiming "the area of 
northern Natal as a volkstaat". "You are the aggressors," he 
charged, before marching out of the office, dressed in a brown 
military uniform and armed with a pistol. 
  His declaration said northern Natal had been acquired by the 
Boere nation through "honest hard work" and through negotiations 
with the Zulu nation. Anyone who attempted to deny the Boere 
nation this right would be regarded as an aggressor and would be 
met with the necessary reaction. 
  Questioned later on the volkstaat's boundaries, Mr Veenendal 
said: "From here to Richards Bay." "Anything that differs with 
the Zulu nation, we'll take up with the king." 
  He said the Boere nation had always had an amicable 
relationship with Zulu people, hence his involvement in training 
them. 
  Mention of ANC support among Zulus was met with rejection 
from Mr Veenendal: "The ANC is not a factor. The ANC cannot 
make a claim, where is their support?" "Their support is 
through intimidation and the build-up of arms caches." 
  He claimed Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC 
military wing] members and commanders had been "sent here from 
outside" for the "onslaught". 
  On concessions regarding the demand for a volkstaat, Mr 
Veenendal said: "I don't need the ANC's concessions, it's my 
volkstaat." 
  On elections, Mr Veenendal said a mood of defiance was 
growing in the district and "I don't see them (a newly elected 
government) governing". "It's one thing being a government and 
another thing governing," he said without elaborating.

<F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>
  [Text] Right-wing plans for civil war are far advanced. It 
can be put into operation within weeks. Excerpts of a top 
secret Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] "war" 
document, which came into RAPPORT's possession this week, even 
contain guidelines for the treatment of prisoners of war. 
Reputable sources close to the Volksfront told RAPPORT this 
week that the coming parliamentary sitting early in March will 
be the possible signal for the launching of the so-called V-day. 
On this V-day ("V" stands for Volkstaat [homeland]), incidents 
of violence could take place. Plans for war have been underway 
for weeks, under the leadership of a group of approximately 50 
retired, but relatively young, senior officers of the South 
African Defense Force. These are mainly brigadiers, colonels, 
and commandants. These officers have been consulting with 
elements in the Inkatha Freedom Party for a long while. 
Meanwhile, Volksfront leader, General Constand Viljoen, is busy 
chasing every negotiation option for a peaceful settlement. 
  Planning for the armed resistance is being done under the 
greatest cloud of secrecy by planners who work independently of 
each other in small groups. Even influential leadership figures 
in the Volksfront, apparently including nearly the entire 
so-called "transitional government," are still totally unaware 
of the plans. Senior officers involved in drafting these war 
plans apparently have little patience with politicians. They 
"can continue with their useless actions." Even General Tienie 
Groenewald, one of the leadership figures in the Volksfront, is, 
according to RAPPORT's information, in the dark about plans for 
an armed struggle. Gen. Groenewald, a former senior officer in 
Military Intelligence, is not trusted by influential people 
within the Volksfront. It is interesting to note that the AWB 
[Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has played no part in the 
drafting of these war plans. One of the reasons is that the AWB 
is regarded as being fully infiltrated by agents in the state 
Intelligence service. 
  It appears that planners are careful to avoid the armed 
resistance from becoming a form of so-called "ethnic cleansing," 
where blacks are shot at random. This issue is strongly 
stressed by senior army officers heading the operation. 
  In the Volksfront document in RAPPORT's possession, marked 
"Top Secret," there is repeated reference to "the pending 
confrontation": "As a result of the composition of the SADF 
[South African Defense Force] and SAP [South African Police] the 
pending confrontation will undoubtedly result in the capture of 
large numbers of prisoners of war that will have to be 
controlled and managed by own forces. It is of cardinal 
importance that members be fully informed about action expected 
of them in this regard. It is in the interest of future 
relations between the various groups, as well as the Christian 
duty of each individual and military unit, to be sympathetic in 
the exercising of their duties." 
  Thereafter, broad guidelines are given for the handling of 
prisoners of war. Among other things, it stipulates that they 
must be treated according to the rules of the Geneva Convention, 
and if a criminal act should lead to the death of a prisoner, 
then the person responsible will be charged with murder and will 
be court martialed. The court will have to reach a decision 
within 24 hours and sentence will also have to passed in this 
time. Another instruction is that the "transporting" of 
prisoners will be the responsibility of "area commanders," who 
will have to identify collection points before 24 January 1994. 
RAPPORT has determined that this instruction has already been 
carried out and that the so-called collection points are farms 
in the northern Transvaal. The document does not mention Gen. 
Constand Viljoen. At time of going to press he could not be 
reached for comment.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 20 SAPA--The Afrikaner Volksfront's 
[AVF, Afrikaner National Front] official spokesman on Sunday 
denied any knowledge of allegations that right wing plans for 
starting a civil war were well-advanced, and that hostilities 
could begin when Parliament reopened. AVF spokesman Stephan 
Maninger also rejected as ridiculous a secret document, 
partially reproduced in the Afrikaans Sunday newspaper RAPPORT, 
which detailed the treatment of "prisoners of war". 
  RAPPORT said impeccable sources averred that about 50 young 
retired South African Defence Force soldiers, mainly brigadiers, 
colonels and commandants, had been hatching war plans for the 
past few weeks. "V-day," [volkstaat day] when the action would 
commence, could be when Parliament re-opened next month, the 
report said. 
  The AVF's leadership and interim government were unaware of 
these plans, the report said. Said Mr Maninger on Sunday: "The 
AVF has made it clear in the past that it would seek every 
possible peaceful alternative before considering any military 
action whatsoever. 
  "We are of the opinion that if there is such a document its 
origins are within those organisations who intend to discredit 
and demonise the AVF," Mr Maninger said. 
  A government intelligence source said on Sunday the 
developments, if true, would be in line with information of a 
schism between the militant commando factions of the AVF and its 
leadership which was still pursuing a political solution by 
means of talks with government and the African National 
Congress. The source said the militant faction mistrusted some 
AVF leaders, suspecting them of being government agents. 
  AVF leader Gen Constand Viljoen said on Saturday certain 
intelligence services were making attempts to cause division 
among right wing Afrikaners, SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation] radio news reported earlier. Gen Viljoen said 
Afrikaners were vulnerable to infiltration, and it was a 
technique of intelligence services to infiltrate such ranks and 
sow division. 
  He later told SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
radio news staff that it was possible the government's 
intelligence service was involved. 
  Gen Viljoen would not give examples of the alleged 
infiltration, but said certain things were happening which 
caused him to draw this conclusion.

  [Text] Newcastle Feb 22 SAPA -- Groups of right-wingers 
began gathering in Newcastle on Tuesday afternoon to declare the 
northern Natal town part of an Afrikaner "volkstaat" [homeland] 
and to propose boundaries for their homeland. 
  The volkstaaters, mostly farmers dressed in khaki uniforms, 
gathered in small groups around the town to prepare for a 
procession and rally later in the day. Local Afrikaner 
Volksfront [National Front--AVF] leader Harry Schutte said the 
right-wingers were planning to deliver a letter of demands to 
Newcastle's mayor before their public meeting on Tuesday evening. 
  Their demands included agreement that Newcastle should fall 
within a volkstaat and that a local Afrikaner town council be 
established. The rally in the evening is expected to be 
addressed by Volksfront leaders Ferdi Hartzenberg and Gen Tienie 
Groenewald. 
  Mr Schutte said local right-wingers wanted to begin drafting 
the boundaries of their volkstaat at Tuesday's gathering. 
  Local African National Congress [ANC] Chairman Mandla Cele 
said his organisation would consider a consumer boycott of white 
businesses should the Town Council act in favour of the 
volkstaaters. 
  Handfuls of right-wingers in lorries and other farm vehicles 
bearing slogans such as "we don't want to fight, but we will" 
and "this is our volkstaat" gathered at entrances to the town 
from midday. Organisers said they expected as many as 4,000 
supporters to converge on Newcastle later on Tuesday.

  [Excerpts] Right wingers converged on two towns today to 
highlight their demands for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. 
These reports from Rene Heine in Newcastle and Andries van Zyl 
in Bloemfontein. 
  [Heine] Newcastle was transformed into Boer country today. 
Farmers, residents, and supporters of the Volksfront [National 
Front] gathered in the center of the town. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Rene Heine is still in Newcastle. Rene, what's 
the latest? 
  [Heine] I'm standing here at a packed farmers' hall outside 
Newcastle where thousands of Afrikaner Volksfront supporters 
have gathered. Gen. Tienie Groenewald has just addressed the 
crowd and told them to prepare for mobilization. He said a new 
government will take over 80 percent of the Afrikaners' jobs. 
He said this was the ANC's [African National Congress] 
so-called affirmative action. His constant reference to a 
volkstaat for northern Natal was met by loud applause and 
cheering from the crowd. CP [Conservative Party] leader Dr. 
Ferdi Hartzenberg will in minutes address the crowd.

<F P=106> [Report by Nick Olivari] </F>
  [Text] The beleaguered SAP [South African Police], which 
has seen 14,000 seasoned members resign in the past two years, 
is facing a fresh crisis. This follows the leaking to 
rank-and-file members of the contents of a top-level directive 
demanding the names of all policemen in the Witwatersrand region 
who have fired their weapons two or more times in the line of 
duty. The order was given by commissioner Lieutenant-General 
Koos Calitz and sent out in a confidential February 2 letter 
from the SAP's Human Resources Department to all specialist 
units and station commanders. 
  Coming less than three months before election, the demand is 
being seen at grassroots level as extremely sinister, especially 
in light of the ANC's [African National Congress] promise last 
year that once in power, the file of each and every SAP member 
would be reviewed to rid the force of those with "blood on their 
hands." 
  The SAP was quick to deny this week that the information was 
part of a "witch hunt," saying it was needed to identify SAP 
members suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome and who 
may be in need of counselling. SAP spokesman Colonel Dave Bruce 
also denied that the list was linked to a request from the ANC 
for details of shootings involving Lance-Sergeant Allan Kruger, 
found by an inquest court to have been responsible for the death 
of Ismael Moloane, one of ANC deputy president Walter Sisulu's 
bodyguards, during a high-speed shootout on the Soweto highway 
last July. 
  But grassroots members remain unconvinced. One, who resigned 
this week, said: "The ANC just asks for something and that's it. 
No one gives a damn about us." 
  Senior police officers said they did not believe the 
information was being sought in the interests of individual 
members. "All you have to do is fire warning shots on two 
separate occasions, and your name goes on the list -- so almost 
every cop in uniform will be on it." said one. Said another: 
"What are we supposed to do? Get out there and chase car 
hijackers armed with AKs, knowing that if we use our weapons, 
we'll end up on some list?" 
  Morale in the SAP -- already at an all-time low according to 
SA [South African] Police Union (Sapu) president Andy Miller -- 
has been further eroded by the directive. But the biggest 
danger to law and order lies in the warning by the newly-formed 
and 10,000-strong Sapu that the lists could lead to widespread 
labour unrest within the force. 
  National secretary Peter-Don Brandt says: "It seems as 
though these lists could form part of so-called 'commissions of 
truth,' with the police being blamed for enforcing unjust laws 
of the past, when everyone knows it's the politicians who should 
take that responsibility." 
  This week, a number of policemen who have resigned since 
January told the SUNDAY TIMES they were disillusioned and 
disgusted by the "lack of direction and uncertainty which is not 
being addressed by the brass."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Detention Without Trial Law `Inauspicious' -- The detention 
without trial law, "misnamed the Abolition of Restrictions on 
Free Political Activity Act, provides for internment without 
trial for up to 10 days," notes a page-20 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 23 February. "The argument 
for the new, improved detention law is that it is a temporary 
expedient, designed to protect the transition to democracy and 
to last only until the Bill of Rights is enacted when a new 
government is installed in April. The situation is different 
now, supporters of the law contend: what is being protected is 
a process approved by the majority, not a tyrannical oligarchy. 
But to accept these arguments is to endorse the maxim that the 
end justifies the means. As nuanced as the situation is, it is 
not a maxim that liberal democrats can embrace. These defensive 
arguments take no account of the crucial point that a law 
providing for detention without trial, even on a limited basis, 
provides an inauspicious foundation for a new democratic South 
Africa." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC Intimidation of NP, DP Supporters -- "It does not take 
much political savvy to realise that it is crucial" for the 
National Party (NP) and the Democratic Party (DP) to recruit 
black people if they are to make any electoral breakthroughs in 
black communities, contends Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 
on 23 February in a page-16 editorial. "While there is no 
suggestion that the ANC is officially countering this trend 
through intimidation and murder, it is not beyond the realms of 
possibility that some of its over- enthusiastic supporters are." 
"The ANC [African National Congress] leadership has often 
raised the issue of political tolerance. It now has a duty to 
spread a message that this specific kind of intimidation is 
unacceptable." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Atrocious Socio-Economic Conditions Spawning Violence -- 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 23 February in a page-12 
editorial views the "outbreak of violence in Bekkersdal," saying 
it demands that "political organisations in Bekkersdal come 
together as a gesture of solidarity for peace and the defence of 
their families and property." SOWETAN believes the violence is 
"spawned by atrocious socio-economic conditions. Those who 
kill and burn have no hope for the future and have nothing to 
lose. It is perhaps time that all involved, including the 
Government, inject some hope into these areas."

  [Excerpts] President Alpha Omar Konare on 21 February 
received delegations from the following opposition parties: 
National Committee for Democratic Initiative, Union for 
Democracy and Development, BDIA, PLT, PSP, PIDT, UDD, UFDP, and 
UNDP [expansions unknown]. The parties presented an open letter 
to the president of the Republic concerning the prevailing 
situation of insecurity in the country. Two parties whose names 
appear in the text of the letter did not sign it and were not 
represented either. They are the Malian Party for Development 
[PMD] and the Rally for Democracy and Progress [RDP]. Seidou 
Guindo discloses the content of the communique issued at the end 
of the meeting. 
  [Guindo] The signatories of the open letter indicated that a 
system of violence has been established and is characterized by 
blind repression, state terrorism, and censure. In the face of 
this the situation, the signatories appealed to the president of 
the Republic, the guarantor of Republican institutions, for an 
immediate end to all violence: ransacking, arson, physical 
aggression, threats and insults, and acts perpetrated by private 
militia. They pledged to search for the appropriate means to 
ensure their own protection and that of their leaders and to 
take every action to counter the activities of the private 
militia of the Alliance for Democracy in Mali if the militia is 
not immediately disbanded. The signatories also called for the 
reopening of schools, independent Radio Kaira, release of 
university and high schools students and all other arrested or 
kidnapped citizens in order to create a conducive atmosphere for 
the resumption of dialogue. They also called for an immediate 
holding of a national debate on the current social and political 
crisis facing the country which threatens the very existence of 
the nation. 
  The president of the Republic thanked his guests for the 
initiative. He recalled all the efforts made by the country's 
authorities to stifle the crisis and check any excesses that may 
be detrimental to the democratic process. [passage omitted] 
  He deplored the silence observed by certain partners and 
called on all and sundry to join in fighting violence which, he 
said, is the worst enemy of democracy. This is why, he added, 
the Republican laws must be enforce and they will be. The 
essential this is that all must be done according to the norms 
of a state where there is the rule of law. 
  Addressing opposition party representatives on education, he 
said it was tragic that schools have been closed down. He 
regretted that during his tenure conditions are not ripe for 
students to be asked to return to classes which have been 
desperately empty for a long time. He called for dialogue to be 
pursued. Despite the suspension of dialogue by Association of 
Malian Students and Pupils, the president of the Republic 
reaffirmed his desire to strive for the reopening of schools 
under conditions that are more conducive for academic work. 
  The president of the Republic also touched on the question 
of 
the closure of Radio Kaira and referred to the operational 
program for independent radio stations. He expressed his 
unflinching attachment to press freedom, a mainstay of democracy. 
  During the talks, the president of the Republic stressed the 
need for all democrats and patriots to understand the necessity 
of the security forces's role in preventing excesses linked with 
self-defense or with the emergence of private militia. I would 
not tolerate the existence of any private militia, no matter the 
origin, the president said. He then called on the party 
representatives to produce evidence of the existence of such 
militia and arraign them before the Republican institutions. He 
said he himself will see to the strict respect of rights and 
public information. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking on allegations that the president has been 
exercising pressure on magistrates, he called on his detractors 
to reveal, on their honor, the identity of those who were 
subjected to such pressure and expressed his concern, as 
chairman of the Higher Council of the Magistrature, to ensure 
that the judiciary is independent and reliable as the case is in 
a state where there is the rule of law. Finally, President 
Konare said he welcomed proposals from all quarters relating to 
education, devaluation, and even to state media management. To 
conclude, he asked the party representatives not to view this 
meeting as a mere formality or just a way of calling the 
national and international communities to witness only for each 
side to turn coasts later and stick to its earlier position 
instead of striving to find a lasting solution to the present 
situation.

  [Excerpts] French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin 
arrived in Bangui this morning for the implementation of backup 
measures concerning the devaluation. Soon after he arrived, Mr. 
Roussin went to meet the country's authorities, particularly 
President Ange-Felix Patasse, who granted him a very lengthy 
audience late this morning. At the end of the audience, the 
French minister expressed satisfaction with the resumption of 
school activities and work in the public sector. He also 
reiterated his country's stand towards Africa by stating that 
France is not abandoning Africa. He redefined the orientation 
of French aid, and referred to the 30-billion French franc 
package allocated to banks in the franc zone. Here is Mr. 
Roussin responding to questions from the press. 
  [Begin recording] [Roussin] Whenever France makes 
commitments it honors them. When Africa makes certain decisions 
France remains loyal to it. When it is said here and there that 
France is ditching Africa, France is abandoning its friends, and 
that a new page has been turned -- that is all baseless. You 
are not abandoning your friends when you give 30 billion francs 
to help them go through a delicate transition for the 
relaunching of real growth and development. That is not true. 
So, indeed, not only have we taken considerable measures -- 
during a difficult period for us -- to support this courageous 
decision from the African countries -- and it will be seen 
within a few months that all of us within the franc zone made a 
good decision -- but even the backup measures have to be 
negotiated between the various parties. 
  We have also put strong pressure on international 
institutions so that everybody, taking into account the efforts 
made by Africa, in turn, comes to Africa's aid. On 22 February, 
I will be going to Brussels to see EC chief Jacques Delors and, 
there too, champion Africa's cause and explain the efforts that 
have been made, so that Europe can also participate in assisting 
Africa. You talked about the backup measures [words indistinct] 
minister with whom we met this morning, well, France will make 
additional efforts. You know, in addition, we have constituted 
a special fund to help -- in countries where this will be 
necessary -- the most underprivileged people during this 
transition period following the devaluation decision, until the 
point arrives where economies start picking up again under the 
new conditions. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] You talked about 30 billion 
francs, how will these funds be distributed among the various 
countries? 
  [Roussin] These 30 billion francs represent general aid from 
France. In effect, it constitutes the cancellation of Africa's 
debt. Africa owed France 25 billion francs, and we are 
canceling that debt. There is 5 billion in project assistance 
-- France wants to keep this rate up in cooperation efforts, 
efforts made by the government and which are accepted by the 
National Assembly and the Senate -- which is continuing. In 
addition, we have this special social assistance fund. [passage 
omitted] Therefore, France does not intend to ditch Africa. 
France without Africa would not be the same. We are bound, we 
are united. The success of these current operations will be the 
success of Africa, it will be that of the Central African 
Republic, and also that of France. We are closely bound within 
the franc zone family and nobody can [words indistinct]. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] [passage indistinct] 
  [Roussin] I know that on 15 February an agreement was signed 
between the appropriate minister and the head of mission. I 
myself have signed other agreements that [words indistinct] were 
very considerable and that apparently have been disbursed. The 
French Cooperation Fund has been given very specific directives. 
The Cooperation Mission has been given very specific 
directives. The IMF has committed itself. The World Bank has 
committed itself -- the first disbursements of the World Bank 
for some countries are already under way -- and we have never 
joined hands as much as now in order to manage a problem of such 
dimensions. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Brazzaville, 19 Feb (AFP) -- Congolese President 
Pascal Lissouba went to Gbadolite in northeastern Zaire to meet 
his Zairean counterpart, Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko, it was 
learned from well- informed sources in Brazzaville. President 
Lissouba left the Congolese capital aboard a special plane 
chartered by Marshal Mobutu, at whose initiative this meeting is 
taking place, these sources point out. 
  This meeting, of only a few hours, is expected to be devoted 
to relations between the two countries, which have recently 
experienced a "little bit of tension" following maltreatment of 
some Zairean nationals in the Congolese capital. President 
Lissouba, whose departure was not officially announced, is 
expected back in his country later this afternoon.

  [Excerpt] A buffer force is today being deployed in the 
southern suburbs of Brazzaville in Congo, which have been the 
scene of bloody ethnic clashes in recent months. All sides 
agreed to the deployment of the force after the cease-fire 
agreement signed on 30 January by deputies from the four regions 
of the south of the country. The force is being sent to keep 
the belligerents apart and to contain the various militias in 
their zones. This force of 400 men is due to be deployed today. 
It already began to take up its positions on the night of 
Friday to Saturday [18-19 February]. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Eight members of Equatorial Guinea's opposition 
party, the Popular Union, have been detained for a week now in 
(Edipgin), not far from the Gabonese border. According to a 
communique issued by the party this morning in Libreville, the 
arrests are part of a strategy established by the Government of 
Equatorial Guinea to close down all the offices of opposition 
parties which boycotted the recent 21 December legislative 
elections.

  [Text] Radio Liberte, organ of the National Lumberjacks 
Rally [RNB], one of the main opposition parties in Gabon, has 
been reduced to silence because it was destroyed in the early 
dawn by security forces. This incident coincides with the 
tension that has been mounting in Libreville since yesterday. 
Jean-Claude Franck Medome has the details 
  [Medome] There is a sudden increase in tension following the 
unlimited general strike launched by the Gabonese Free Trade 
Unions Confederation [CGSL]. This strike turned into violent 
demonstrations characterized by roadblocks and the burning of 
tires, public vehicles, and buildings, including a police 
station in the second police district in the capital. People 
and motorists who tried to go to work were assaulted by 
demonstrators. Such sporadic incidents were still noted this 
morning, and, in the opinion of the government, this explosion 
of wrath is the handiwork of the opposition. The government 
says opposition leaders, at a rally over the weekend, called on 
their supporters to adhere to the CGSL's call for a general 
strike and civil disobedience. This strike call was echoed by 
Radio Liberte, the RNB radio that was destroyed early this 
morning by security forces. 
  It is difficult, for the moment, to estimate the extent of 
the damage. In the face of the deterioration of the political 
and social climate, the government has decided to restore the 
state of warning, which is marked notably by a curfew from 2200 
to 0530 throughout the country. 
  [Paris AFP in French in a Libreville-datelined item at 1236 
GMT on 22 February adds the following: "Presidential Guard 
armored vehicles took up positions in downtown Libreville by 
midday, where the state of warning has been in force since 
yesterday. Armored vehicles and truckloads of troops of the 
Presidential Guard were notably deployed along the boulevard 
facing the sea where the Presidential Palace is situated."]

  [Text] Political violence broke out in Libreville 
yesterday. Radio-Tele Liberte was destroyed early yesterday 
morning by the Armed Forces, which stormed the radio station 
located at Terre-Nouvelle. After Radio-Tele Liberte was 
destroyed, opposition supporters retaliated by killing (Jean 
Kamougue-Komo), a member of the Gabonese Democratic Party [PDG]. 
  The government daily L'UNION has reported the death of an 
unidentified person at Yayi crossroads, who was killed as the 
security forces were destroying a barricade. Tension has been 
high in Libreville since 21 February when the Federation of Free 
Trade Unions called for an indefinite general strike.

  [Text] In a final bid to draw the Freedom Alliance into the 
election, the Negotiating Council has accepted another 
concession to the alliance. It relates to the powers of 
regions. Late last night the Negotiating Council agreed to the 
principle of the provinces exercising a form of exclusive 
powers, which has been a major alliance demand. It was decided 
that a law passed by a provincial legislature should prevail 
over national legislation. A national government will only be 
allowed to set minimum standards, with reference to the word 
concurrent having been dropped. The two proponents of the 
concession said there was now no reason for the Freedom Alliance 
to stay out of the election. 
  [Begin recording] [Government negotiator Roelf Meyer] We can 
truly state now that the Negotiating Council, through the 
proposals that were put to it for consideration today, and if 
accepted all together, now addresses all the concerns that were 
raised in the process of further negotiations with the Freedom 
Alliance. 
  [African National Congress negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa] We 
believe, sir, that with this agreement the Freedom Alliance 
parties have no further reason, whatsoever, in staying outside 
the process in refusing to participate in the elections, and we 
would call upon all of them to consider these proposals and 
accept them as such -- as the meeting of the Negotiating Council 
today virtually closes the chapter of negotiations in the formal 
sense, for amendments to the constitution, and that we should 
now proceed with these amendments to parliament and prepare the 
country for elections. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Jonathan Ewing] </F>
  [Text] Mogadishu, Feb 23 (AFP) -- Heavy inter-clan fighting 
has erupted around the volatile southern Somali port city of 
Kismaayo and dozens of people are reported to have been injured, 
UN officials announced here on Wednesday [23 February]. 
  According to UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) spokesman 
George Bennett, at least 21 people were reported wounded in the 
new round of fighting. Bennett said the casualty figures could 
be considerable higher than those indicated by initial reports 
coming out of Kismaayo. "I think you could infer that there 
were more casualties, though we have not been able to confirm 
that", Bennett told a press briefing here. 
  The reports said mortars and "technicals", the Mad-Max-style 
vehicles mounted with 106mm recoilless rifles or machine guns, 
were used in the latest battle, which centered around the 
villages of Yontoy and Gobweyne, a few kilometres (miles) 
outside Kismaayo. 
  UN officials here speculate that the latest fighting could 
have been retaliation for battles fought several weeks ago 
between forces loyal to General Mohamed Hersi, known as Morgan, 
and those of Colonel Omar Jays, in which 20 people were killed, 
42 wounded and more than 5,000 others displaced. During the 
fighting, General Morgan's forces pushed Ogadeni clan militia, 
mostly allied to warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid, out of Kismaayo. 
  Observers here see the lawless streets of Kismaayo as a 
likely flash-point if civil war broke out again between forces 
loyal to self-proclaimed interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed and 
those of General Aidid. 
  Kismaayo was the scene of some of the most vicious fighting 
during the civil war and has remained a bone of contention 
between Morgan and Jays. Both men were prohibited from 
entering the city by the United Nations after months of sporadic 
fighting in the city as the two warlords tried to wrest control 
from each other's faction. The ban was, however, lifted in late 
January.

  [Text] Reports from Digfer Hospital, Mogadishu, say the 
bodies of two Somali men killed by Pakistani soldiers are lying 
in the hospital. Neither the Pakistani troops nor UN Operation 
Somalia [UNOSOM] have commented on the killing of the two men, 
who were killed near the university on 11 and 12 February. The 
incident was actually hidden from the media. 
  Malyuun Abdulle Mohamoud, mother of one of the dead men -- 
Abdullahi Abdi Ogle -- who was speaking at the hospital this 
morning to our health affairs reporter Abshir Nur Ali, said she 
had been going to the Pakistani barracks for the last nine days 
asking to see the body of her son. The identity of the second 
man is still unknown. Some people believe that bodies of people 
killed are being hidden in UNOSOM camps, particularly in 
Pakistani one, with the aim of hiding them from reporters.

  [Text] Yaounde, 22 Feb (AFP) -- The entire Cameroonian 
media today accused Nigeria of causing the escalation at both 
countries' border. After the government daily CAMEROON TRIBUNE 
denounced Nigeria's "ambitions" yesterday, the national 
television in the evening devoted a special program to the tense 
situation on the Bakassi Peninsula, stating that Cameroon was 
within its right. The television bases its stand on the 
communique issued at the weekend in which Cameroon announced 
that Nigerian units had attacked some Cameroonian positions on 
islands belonging to it. 
  For their part, two independent weeklies, LE MESSAGER and LA 
NOUVELLE EXPRESSION, close to the opposition, denounced 
"Nigerian expansionistic bids." In an editorial published 
yesterday and headed "The duty of solidarity," LE MESSAGER, 
referring to "the illegal occupation of a part of the 
Cameroonian territory," stated that Nigerians "were not naive." 
  "The 18 February attack shows to what extent they are 
determined to snatch from us this part of our territory, but our 
Armed Forces' reaction further demonstrated that the search for 
dialogue, which we have always supported, did not rule out the 
use of force to react to force," the newspaper continues, 
writing straightforwardly: "War has started." 
  For its part, LA NOUVELLE EXPRESSION, today devoted to the 
event its editorial headed: "To the front" in which it calls on 
Cameroonian President Paul Biya to summon "all the Cameroonian 
political leaders worthy of this name to discuss this issue with 
all of them, now that the troops need high morale to resist the 
Nigerian aggressor."

  [Text] In Gabon, the Free Trade Unions' Confederation is 
maintaining a firm stand. The indefinite strike it embarked 
upon is in its third day. Jean-Claude Franck Medome toured the 
streets of Libreville this afternoon and has this report. 
  [Medome] This afternoon, Libreville looked like a ghost 
town. 
The reason for this is that cabs were hard to find. Cab 
drivers, who are usually victims of stone-throwing and attacks, 
preferred to be cautious. This caution is all the more 
justified because the atmosphere in Libreville varied from 
suburb to suburb. There was precarious calm in certain areas 
and persistent tension in others. This is abundant proof that 
the security forces still have their hands full. The security 
forces have not only reinforced their positions in areas prone 
to violence but have also removed the stone, wood, and tire 
barricades. Furthermore, the Gabonese are worried and surprised 
by the disturbances and excesses, which started out as a 
legitimate general strike to call for salary increase [words 
indistinct] what the future holds. 
  There are other concerns and questions surrounding the 
number 
of victims of the disturbances. It has been officially 
announced that at least four people have died. Two of them were 
burned alive. It is, however, possible that more people died in 
the maze of the streets of certain suburbs. It should be 
pointed out that during the destruction of the National 
Lumberjacks' Rally [RNB] radio station by security forces, six 
persons including (Mba Ndakele), political adviser to the RNB 
leader, and (Andre Heyegei), who is in charge of security, were 
arrested and are still in police custody. 
  [Paris AFP in French in a Libreville-datelined item at 2010 
GMT on 23 February adds the following: "State television, 
quoting leaders of the security forces' crisis committee, has 
announced that a senior corporal paratrooper in the Gabonese 
Army was shot dead this afternoon in Libreville during 
disturbances which have been going on in several popular suburbs 
in Libreville over the past three days. 
  ["State television, quoting leaders of the crisis committee 
also announced that the residence of the leading opposition 
leader, Father Paul Mba Abessole, RNB chairman, was occupied in 
the early evening by security forces who were chasing several 
`armed Lumberjack activists.' An opposition spokesman told AFP 
that Father Abessole was not at home at the time of the 
operation and was not arrested. 
  ["It was announced on state television that Father Abessole 
`is in good health.' It was also announced that `some people 
were wounded but no one died' during this operation."]

  [Text] Libreville is relatively calm this morning as the 
general indefinite strike enters its fourth day. There was more 
violence last night since a corporal of the Gabonese Armed 
Forces was killed, thus bringing to four the number of people 
who died during the violence that broke out in the capital. 
  According to the security forces headquarters, the residence 
of Father Paul Mba Abessole, leader of the National Lumberjacks 
Rally [RNB], was occupied last night by security forces, where 
they found several supporters carrying weapons who opened fire 
at them. According to an opposition,spokesman, the RNB leader 
was not at home during the operation [words indistinct]. 
  In brief, one may note that 30 delinquents have been 
arrested 
for lootings shops. 
  Surely, it is to ease tension that President Omar Bongo has 
been holding talks since 0900 with trade union federations 
including the Gabonese Free Trade Unions Confederation, the 
Gabonese Trade Union Confederation, and the Union of Gabonese 
Workers as well as the Gabonese Employers Association. The 
meeting is taking place at the conference hall of the Presidency 
.

  [Excerpts] Following the call for a general strike launched 
by the Federation of Free Trade Unions, the government issued a 
statement taking stock of the 21 February events in Libreville. 
[passage omitted] 
  The government explained that opposition Radio Liberte was 
destroyed by security forces at dawn yesterday as a punitive 
measure. Radio Liberte has chosen the incitement to hatred, 
violence, and intolerance as its editorial policy. This 
dangerous option, Idriss Ngari, chief of the general crisis 
staff explained, brought about the military operation against 
the radio station. He said in an interview published this 
morning that the Armed Forces acted to safeguard the interest of 
the nation. 
  Justifying the operation that led to the destruction of 
Radio 
Liberte, the chief of the general crisis staff said that the 
Armed Forces could no longer accept to be the target of 
opposition party militiamen and that soldiers could no longer 
allow themselves to be killed by what he called fanatics and 
agent provocateurs. According to General Idriss Ngari, 
Radio-Tele Liberte has been broadcasting messages in all 
national languages calling for civil disobedience, hatred, 
revolt, and civil war for a month now. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Radio Liberte was set up to back Paul Mba Abessole, 
a former Catholic priest and leader of the opposition National 
Lumberjacks Rally. Reporter Yvette Biregou asked him how he 
responded to yesterday events: 
  [Begin recording] [Abessole, in French with superimposed 
translation into English] I say that it is Bongo and his armed 
bandits who are continuing to follow with their logic. They 
want to exterminate all differences and to remain the sole 
master on the boat. I think the Gabonese will not accept this. 
I am demanding all Gabonese to stand and to get rid of this 
tyranny. I would also like to hail all the democrats at the 
international level, to bring us their support and so that there 
will be a responsible and humanitarian democracy. 
  [Biregou] The government has ordered its troops onto the 
streets. How do you respond to that? 
  [Abessole] Well, you know, it is the people who are reacting 
and this is what I had said when Bongo's election was 
acknowledged by his constitutional court. I said that the 
people themselves would react. I am only an element of the 
people who were elected. The people are organizing themselves. 
I do not know what it is capable of doing in a few days. What 
I know is that they will react. [end recording]

This morning, five dead and 22 injured people were registered, 
while on 21 and 22 February the hospital registered seven dead 
and 21 injured people. Informed sources say numbers are growing 
as the killings in various suburbs continue. Police sources say 
that the most affected area is Gikondo where this morning a 
woman and her two children were killed, while last night seven 
dead were taken away. Another affected suburb is that (Gasaka), 
but the police have not yet informed us about the human and 
material losses there. 
  Kigali remains a ghost town. Government employees did not go 
back to work because the public and private transport is at a 
standstill. Shops did not open. The streets are empty except 
for the cars of expatriates.

  [Text] Kigali, 23 Feb (AFP) -- Tribal clashes in the 
Rwandan capital claimed several dozen civilian lives overnight, 
relief officials said Wednesday [23 February] as preparations 
went ahead to swear in transitional authorities to end ethnic 
conflict. Government officials gave no toll from the fighting, 
which followed the murder late Monday of Public Works Minister 
Felicien Gatabazi, a Hutu from the southern town of Butare, and 
the revenge lynching of radical Hutu leader Martin Bucyana. 
  Witnesses said they heard gunfire, and that former rebels of 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) soldiers, who are 
predominantly Tutsi, were fighting residents of the majority 
Hutu tribe in Kigali. A spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission 
for Rwanda said however that its troops always accompanied RPF 
men, and he could not confirm that former rebels were involved 
in armed incidents. Humanitarian agency sources said there had 
probably been casualties in what they described as "very 
localised" clashes, but most of the capital was calm, they added.

  [Excerpts] In Rwanda the political situation is becoming 
increasingly tense following yesterday's political 
assassinations of an opposition leader and also a Hutu leader 
close to President Habyarimana. Over the last 24 hours the 
Rwandan capital, Kigali, has been the scene of street clashes, 
and in political terms things are not going well; the 
transitional parliament and government have not yet been 
installed. Our special correspondent Simone Remont reports from 
Kigali: 
  [Remont] In Kigali this afternoon, the investiture ceremony 
for the broad-based government that has already been postponed 
many times came to a rapid end. Important absentees were the 
prime minister designate of the future government and the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front. [passage omitted] 
  The situation is completely deadlocked, set against a 
backdrop of two political assassinations and the murderous 
violence which has resulted in about 40 dead and many injured in 
the Rwandan capital. The situation is all the more worrying 
because the former rebels of the Patriotic Front are now taking 
a tougher line. 
  Everything is calm in Kigali this evening, but unless a 
rapid 
political solution is found, one can fear further trouble. 
Simon Remont in Kigali for the Newsreel. 
  [Announcer] [passage omitted] Belgian Foreign Minister Willy 
Claes, who has arrived in Burundi, has commented on the 
situation in nearby Rwanda from the capital, Bujumbura. Willy 
Claes says that he is disappointed and irritated by the lack of 
goodwill on the part of all the political leaders who are 
seeking to keep a share of power for themselves rather than 
throwing themselves into sorting out Rwanda's economy. Willy 
Claes's remarks are targeted equally at the forces of President 
Habyarimana and the opposition. Last weekend Willy Claes was in 
Kigali and he sent a very firm message to the Rwandan 
politicians by threatening the suspension of western aid.

  [Text] One RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] soldier was 
seriously injured in an ambush led by government troops--an 
ambush which had been intended to wipe out RPF leaders who had 
been invited to Kigali by the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda 
[UNAMIR]. The incident took place yesterday 22 February at a 
place called Gasata on the outskirts of Kigali. The RPF leaders 
who had been on their way to Kigali decided to turn back after 
reaching Ngondole because of the worsening security situation in 
Kigali. The RPF escort unit, together with UNAMIR troops, 
decided to continue to Kigali, but were stopped by an abrupt 
roadblock at Gasata, near Kigali, and before the vehicles could 
stop they were spread with bullets from the nearby houses. The 
two vehicles, that of RPF soldiers and UNAMIR overturned, 
seriously injuring one RPF soldier. The injured soldier was 
rushed to King Faysal in Kigali which is used by the UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda. 
  President Habyarimana's intention to kill RPF leaders 
(?just) 
after the assassination of PSD [Social Democatic Party] 
secretary general, the late Felicien Gatabazi, intended to deal 
a blow to the opposition parties and to the implementation of 
the Arusha agreement.

  [Text] Kigali, 24 Feb (AFP) -- Tribal fighting in the 
Rwandan capital following the murder of a government minister 
left at least 30 people dead and some 150 wounded, humanitarian 
agency workers said here Thursday [24 February]. Most of the 
injured had been struck with pangas (machetes) or sticks, they 
said. 
  After its first peaceful night this week, Kigali was 
"halfway 
back to normal," residents said, as traffic picked up, stores 
reopened and people gradually went back to work. 
  The unrest delayed yet again the swearing-in of a new 
transitional government in which former rebels of the largely 
Tutsi Patriotic Front are to have portfolios. Several political 
parties boycotted the ceremony scheduled for Wednesday, 
complaining that President Juvenal Habyarimana had been 
arbitrary in his choice of ministers. 
  Public Works Minister Felicien Gatabazi was gunned down here 
on Monday. An angry mob in his home district of Butare in the 
south lynched fellow Hutu Martin Bucyana the next day, blaming 
the hardline politician's movement for the minister's 
assassination.

<F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister-designate Faustin Twagiramungu to </F>
the nation on the delay in setting up transitional institutions 
in Kigali on 23 February--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Due to certain words uttered yesterday and today 
on the setting up of the transitional government, I deemed it 
important to brief Rwandans on the course of the current events, 
especially now that our country is in difficulty. I wish to say 
that the president of the Republic should not take advantage of 
the difficult situation we are in by trying to set up 
transitional institutions the way he wants them. That is why I 
wish to explain to Rwandans the situation affecting the setting 
up of the transitional institutions and also to inform them 
about the content of our talks. [passage omitted] 
  It is not the prime minister's fault that the transitional 
government has not been formed, but that of the president of the 
Republic, who wants things done his way so that he can put in 
place his own ministers from parties he agrees with and also 
appoint deputies of his choice. 
  Concerning the Republican Democratic Movement, I would like 
to reiterate that the Arusha agreement specified 11 deputies, 
not seven. Therefore, I cannot agree that the governmebnt be 
formed before the four deputies are reinstated. No one took 
them to court; I am the one who was taken to court. Let them 
allow me to defend myself and be defeated. Even if I were 
defeated, so long as the deputies are not taken to court so that 
they are defeated on their own account, they should [words 
indistinct]. 
  I would like to add that the meeting of parties called for 
by 
the president of the Republic for Friday [25 February] will be 
useless [words indistinct] with the Rwandan Patriotic Front in 
accordance with Article 14 of the Arusha agreement. In 
accordance with that article, the meeting should be called by 
the parties. If the president wished to take part so as to hear 
what the parties say, then it is possible, but I do not think 
that he has the power to call such a meeting. It cannot lead us 
to anything tangible, since he has already taken decisions about 
which he informed Rwandans. Thank you for allowing me to address 
the Rwandans.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] Every time Rwanda seems on the verge of getting 
its transitional government inaugurated under the terms of last 
August's Arusha accord between President Habyarimana and the 
Tutsi-led RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels it all goes 
wrong. [passage omitted] 
  In the thick of it all is the UN military mission sent to 
keep the peace between the rebels and government forces. On the 
line to Kigali, Robin White asked the UN commander in Rwanda, 
General Romeo Delaire, how alarmed he was by these developments. 
  [Begin recording] [Delaire] Well, we are concerned that the 
violence has escalated over the last three days to four days as 
we have seen more use of weapons, more use of grenades, and of 
course, we have had the two assassinations that have created 
enormous amount of reaction in the population, and fear. 
  [White] Is there anything that you can do to get things back 
to some kind of normality? 
  [Delaire] Well, if you are asking me as the force commander 
on the UN force, we are deploying with the gendarmerie and 
police communale [municipal police] all the resources we can to 
instill in the populations a sense that there is still order.... 
  [White, interrupting] Exactly what are your men now doing? 
  [Delaire] My men are conducting patrols; they are conducting 
checkpoints to see if there are arms being moved around. They 
are monitoring all the military installations to ensure they 
respond to the weapons secure area. They are providing escorts 
for the RPF and for government officials; they are conducting 
investigations on any cease-fire violations. They are 
monitoring, through our civilian police, the judicial actions 
and investigations by the gendarmerie, and providing technical 
assistance. 
  [White] Now, are you going to hang on in there or might you 
just give up and pull out? 
  [Delaire] My God, those are words that do not at all provide 
for the mandate nor the attitude that the UN has toward these 
peacekeeping missions. I think we are in a difficult political 
impasse. I think the people are very concerned because there 
are extremist elements that are conducting extremist activities. 
I think that in those circumstances the UN must remain firm and 
assist and maintain with the local authorities the (?mortigum) 
of reference points so that the political process can still have 
an opportunity of succeeding. 
  [White] Yes, but people are beginning to talk of an all-out 
civil war. In those circumstances, what would you do? 
  [Delaire] Well, the first thing is that the minute there is 
a 
significant cease-fire violation by either side, then we do not 
have a peacekeeping role anymore, because the only reason we are 
here is that both sides wanted peace, both sides were prepared 
to implement the peace process and also to respect the peace, 
and so if there is a civil war, which has the violations of any 
cease-fire agreement that has been established, then we are no 
more in a peacekeeping role and my mandate does not exist here 
any more. 
  [White] But you do not think you have reached that point 
yet? 
  [Delaire] No, I do not. I think we have some significant 
concerns. I think that the gendarmerie is being pushed to its 
upper scale of capability. I think that we are also being 
committed to put everything we can into this effort be it 
militarily and politically. But no, I do not say that the road 
has ended. I think that people are still talking, they still 
want peace and until this thing collapses, which I still do not 
see, we are going to hang in there and do our job. 
  [White] Now, presumably the RPF people in Kigali, the 
capital, must be pretty scared at the moment. Can you guarantee 
their safety? 
  [Delaire] First of all, they are very concerned, yes and 
anybody would be who had been sitting here for 56 days waiting 
for these decisions to be able to permit them to continue the 
normalcy that was anticipated in the broad-based transitional 
government. They get more concerned every day. They also get 
concerned when people who are sympathetic to them are also being 
singled out and that creates more pressure. I am more concerned 
about them remaining disciplined as they are, remaining calm as 
they are, and willing to abide by the peace agreements and the 
cease-fire agreements that they signed with the government and 
within the mandate of the UN mission. 
  [White] But can you guarantee their safety? 
  [Delaire] My job is not to guarantee safety. If I wanted to 
guarantee safety I would need 40,000 troops here. And even at 
that, to guarantee means that there would be no altercations. 
My aim here and my mandate is quite clear: It is to provide 
both parties with the assistance they need to establish an 
atmosphere of security that they feel essential and confident to 
move ahead with the peace agreement of Arusha. [end recording]

week ago, will resume transmissions today. According to a 
communique, the conservation measure imposed on Radio Kaira will 
be lifted today at 1200. This decision of the authorities 
reflects their determination to apply the relevant texts. Still 
according to the communique, the government consequently informs 
the public that it remains vigilant and will sanction any 
attempt to disturb public peace or to disseminate suspicious and 
tendentious information. For the sake of preserving the freedom 
of expression, it invites all and sundry to strictly respect the

  [Excerpt] A rebel group attacked Arlit early this morning, 
precisely at 0420. The attackers, whose number could not be 
determined, killed two soldiers and took six four-wheel drive 
vehicles belonging to the Akokan Mining Company. During the hot 
pursuit launched shortly after the attack, the defense and 
security forces recovered two vehicles. We got this report a 
while ago from our permanent correspondent in Agadez, Mousselai 
Nazadane. 
  This is the first rebel attack since the last technical 
meeting held in Ouagadougou. Following that meeting, the 
coordination of the four Tuareg rebel movements published its 
political agenda in the form of a document entitled, "Outline of 
the Resistance Program." In a nutshell, the rebels are claiming 
their right to autonomous administration of the territory they 
claim a right to, and guarantees that their community will be 
represented in the government, the National Assembly, and the 
Armed Forces. These are the fundamental demands of the rebels 
as published by the NIGER NEWS AGENCY. [passage omitted]

  [Text] More than 30 Nigerian villages in border areas have 
been burned down by the Cameroonian gendarmes between December 
last year and this month. The commander, 13th Motorized Brigade 
of the Nigerian Army, Brigadier General Wutomi Guirayi, made 
this known in Calabar while addressing newsmen on the situation 
in the Bakassi Peninsula. He said that property estimated at 
millions of naira belonging to Nigerian fishermen and traders 
were also destroyed by the gendarmes. The commander also said 
that many Nigerians were either killed or maimed while their 
fishing nets and boats were seized by the Cameroonians. He 
stated that Nigeria did not retaliate. The commander advised 
journalists wishing to carry out on-the-spot reports to obtain 
clearance from the military before traveling to the Bakassi 
Peninsula.

  [Text] Lagos, 23 Feb. (PANA) -- Nigeria and Ghana have 
expressed concern over the delay in the implementation of the 
Liberian peace accord, signed in Cotonou, Benin Republic in July 
last year, a Nigerian Government statement said Wednesday [23 
February]. The statement was issued in Nigeria's federal 
capital, Abuja, after a Ghanaian envoy, Lt.-Gen. Arnold Quainoo, 
had delivered a message from President Jerry Rawlings, to 
Nigerian leader, Gen. Sani Abacha, on the Liberian crisis and 
other issues. 
  Nigeria and Ghana have troops in the West African peace 
keeping force in Liberia (ECOMOG) [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], which has now been 
expanded and includes battalions from Tanzania and Uganda. 
  Two weeks ago, Ghana served notice of its intention to 
"review" its participation in ECOMOG unless the warring factions 
showed commitment to peace within one month. Nigeria has the 
largest contingent of about 12,000 troops in Liberia and there 
is growing public impatience among Nigerians at the lack of 
progress in the efforts to end the four-year-old war. 
  The statement said that Gen. Quainoo briefed the Nigerian 
leader on the recent tour of Liberia by a Ghanaian military 
delegation and "restated the country's (Ghana's) concern at the 
non-implementation of the Cotonou peace accord". 
  It quoted Gen. Abacha as saying that Nigeria shared Ghana's 
concern at the delay in resolving the Liberian crisis. He 
expressed his belief that "Liberians must be willing to 
cooperate among themselves for amicable resolution of the crisis 
in the war-torn country". 
  Nigeria and Ghana also expressed the need for improved trade 
cooperation between them as a catalyst for sub-regional economic 
integration, the statement added.

  [Text] Lome, 24 Feb (AFP) -- Togolese voters faced a 
further tantalising wait late Wednesday [23 February] for 
results from a historic poll, after the National Electoral 
Commission refused to publish the full count. Four days after 
the second round in the country's first multi-party elections, 
voters are still waiting to see which party is to form the new 
government. 
  President Gnassingbe Eyadema has ruled Togo since 1967. 
  In a statement to journalists Commission President Garba 
Sipohon acknowledged that all the votes had been counted after 
Sunday's poll. "The results will be sent to the Supreme Court 
for evaluation," he said. But Sipohon disclosed the outcome in 
only 19 of the 24 contested districts, which when added to the 
winners of the first round give opposition parties a one-seat 
lead over the former sole ruling pro-Eyadema Togolese People's 
Rally (RPT). Sipohon said the opposition had won 38 seats 
compared to 37 for the RPT. Transitional Premier Joseph 
Koffigoh who stood as an independent also won a spot in the 
81-seat assembly. 
  Both the opposition and the RPT have claimed victory in the 
poll. Sipohon said announcement of the counts in five districts 
had been held back because of the "circumstances" in which 
voting had taken place. Violence marred the poll Sunday when 
polling stations in two districts were forced to close and the 
count was later disturbed in three others. 
  The court has 72 hours to issue an official declaration on 
the results, with challenges having to be presented within the 
subsequent five days. The court will then have a further 10 
days to rule on the challenges. 
  The opposition parties, made up of Action Committee for 
Renewal (CAR) and the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), have 
already claimed victory in the five disputed districts -- which 
would give them an overall majority in the parliament. But on 
Tuesday the RPT accused the opposition of "fraud," alleging it 
had been responsible for the violence. 
  In a statement late Wednesday it claimed victory saying the 
Supreme Court would "confirm its success." "The moment has come 
to form the country's government," the RPT added, declaring 
itself "ready to play its due part" and collaborate in a "large 
national unity government." The commission is made up of four 
pro-presidential sympathisers and four opposition supporters. 
  The four opposition commission members complained Wednesday 
that their colleagues and "outside personalities at a high-level 
in the state" had pressured them into not publishing the full 
results. They said they had threatened to resign if the results 
were not published in their totality. 
  Under the terms of the Constitution Eyadema must name a 
prime 
minister from the ranks of the new majority parties.

  [Text] Lome, 24 Feb (ATOP/PANA)--The National Electoral 
Commission [CEN] late last night published the results of the 
legislative elections in 19 out of the 24 constituencies 
concerned in the second round of the elections that took place 
on 20 February. According to these results, the opposition 
officially won 38 seats as against 37 for President Eyadema's 
supporters and one for Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh. 
  According to CEN Chairman Sipohon Gaba, it is now up to the 
Supreme Court to deliberate on the case of five constituencies 
where incidents disrupted the votes. It should be recalled that 
the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT], the former single ruling 
party led by President Eyadema, accused the opposition of being 
at the origin of the incidents that marred the votes in several 
polling stations and of "organizing fraud to such an extent that 
it was impossible to validate the results of the contested 
constituencies." 
  The opposition has rejected all the accusations leveled 
against it and affirmed that "the RPT should accept defeat 
instead of confusing people." One of the opposition activists 
who is also member of the CEN, Mr. Ali Diabate, affirmed that 
the opposition had definitely won in the five constituencies 
contested by the RPT. He warned that "if the government does 
not proclaim the full results, the four opposition members 
belonging to the CEN will resign." 
  The Supreme Court, to which all the results and various 
reports were submitted on 23 February, has about 10 days to 
deliberate on all the contested cases before proclaiming the 
final results. For their part, foreign observers believe that 
despite the regrettable incidents that took place on 20 
February, "the second round of the legislative elections took 
place in satisfactory conditions."

  [Text] In response to the accusations of fraud leveled 
against it by the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT] and the 
Youth Wing of the Rally of the Togolese People [JRPT] in their 
21 and 22 February declaration, the Action Committee for Renewal 
[CAR] has just sent us a declaration in which it says it is 
surprised that the RPT and the JRPT have accused it of having 
committed massive frauds during the recent legislative 
elections. In its statement, the CAR asserts that in fact, some 
faults were committed and that it is the present government 
entirely committed to the RPT which has organized the elections, 
provided security, and ensured the appointment and management of 
personnel and the equipment. Once again, the CAR reaffirms its 
unchanging desire for nonviolence and immediately encourages all 
the political parties to respect the verdict of the ballot box.

<F P=106> [Government communique issued on 23 February; place not </F>

  [Text] Following the second round of the legislative 
elections, public order is being disturbed in various 
prefectures, as well Lome district, by some irresponsible 
citizens who are perpetrating acts of violence and vandalism 
here and there thus threatening the security of people and 
property. 
  The government hereby condemns these blind and undemocratic 
acts of violence and launches an urgent appeal to all opposition 
party leaders and all citizens to help create an atmosphere of 
tolerance that would guarantee freedom of speech for all, and 
thus prevent our dear motherland from becoming a closed field of 
sterile political struggle at a time when all states in the 
subregion are preoccupied by the economic problems caused by the 
devaluation of the CFA franc. 
  Our country Togo gives the impression of prioritizing the 
political debate to the detriment of the daily difficulties 
facing the majority of our people. The government, in its 
concern to protect our common interest, will take all necessary 
measures to maintain public order and to assure the security of 
people and property throughout the national territory. Firm 
instructions have been given to the security forces to prevent 
all disturbances and to deal with all troublemakers in our 
cities and villages. They will be sought after and brought to 
court.

  [Text] While the people's attention is directed toward the 
peace talks in Lusaka, Zambia, Jose Eduardo dos Santos' troops 
continue to massacre defenseless civilians and loot their 
property in Luena, Moxico Province. Eugenio Rui reports. 
  Beginning 17 February, Jose Eduardo dos Santos' infantry 
troops -- coming from Luena, the center of crime -- have been 
infiltrating our areas from directions, armed to the teeth with 
sophisticated war materiel received from Brazil, Spain, and 
other countries which foment war in Angola. They have been 
attacking villages along Luena River [words indistinct], 
murdering innocent civilians and looting people's property, 
including goats and poultry. 
  Another contingent of that criminal army, in the service of 
corrupt Luanda leaders, destroyed and looted people's property 
along the left bank of [words indistinct].

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] has intensified offensive actions throughout the 
country, creating a bleak picture among the people. Two days 
ago, UNITA ambushed three civilian vehicles between Maria Teresa 
and Zenza do Itombe, killing five civilians. Sources contacted 
today by Luanda Radio revealed that the UNITA offensive actions 
are mainly directed against civilian targets in the country's 
central, southern, and northeastern regions.

Matos says his army controls 30 percent of the countryside and 
90 percent of the urban areas. General Matos said vast areas 
are not controlled by the army or UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola]. He said the Angolan Army had 
recently acquired military equipment from Brazil. 
  It is also reported from Luanda that heavy fighting between 
the Angolan army and one of the hardline factions of the Front 
for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave is continuing. Latest 
reports said a number of civilians in Cabinda have fled to Zaire 
and the Congo.

  [Text] Information received at our news desk today reveals 
that Russian [words indistinct] and transport planes arrived in 
Luanda recently. These war planes carried technicians and 
military advisers contracted as mercenaries to fight the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
UNITA condemns this action which endorses the warmongering and 
criminal speech made by Lucio Lara in Paris recently, 
endangering the Lusaka peace talks. Thus, UNITA will present a 
protest to the United Nations, because it wants to know whether 
it is worthwhile to negotiate peace while Luanda wants war.

  [Text] The Lusaka talks may seek peace for Angola, but in 
Luanda Army General Joao de Matos, chief of general staff of the 
Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, has reported that the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] is moving men and 
equipment to continue the war. 
  In a lengthy interview he granted to JORNAL DE ANGOLA, the 
FAA chief of general staff reaffirmed the need for the Angolan 
people to be ready for war. Gen. Joao de Matos noted that even 
if consensus is achieved in Lusaka, an extremely violent war is 
likely to erupt between the time an accord is signed and its 
implementation. According to him, all that may happen in the 
country during that period will be viewed as incidents, even 
though war would describe the situation more accurately. 
  The FAA chief of general staff warned that no peace accord 
will last for long as there is a military balance between the 
government and UNITA. Gen. Joao de Matos noted that, for peace 
to last, there has to be an imbalance in favor of the 
government. He recognized, however, that there is no military 
solution to the Angolan war, adding that he believes war in 
Angola also depends on developments in South Africa. 
  The FAA chief of general staff also expressed the belief 
that, contrary to what Jonas Savimbi claims, UNITA does not have 
the capacity to withstand another 10 years of war. Gen. Joao de 
Matos believes that what Jonas Savimbi says is one thing, and 
what really happens is quite another.

  [Text] At a time when the attention of all Angolans is 
turned to Zambia, where negotiations between the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Luanda 
regime are under way, the leaders of the regime are strongly 
committed to searching for enigmas to derail the talks. After 
many other war declarations by a number of Futungo de Belas' 
radical wing leaders, now it is the turn of Joao de Matos, 
Eduardo dos Santos' war chief, who has come out to say no to 
peace. Speaking to JORNAL DE ANGOLA, which serves the regime, 
the head of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola tried to deceive the world, accusing UNITA of preparing 
for an extremely violent war regardless of the outcome of Lusaka 
talks. 
  However, sources from the General Staff of the Armed Forces 
for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] reacted violently to such 
statements, describing them as a hallucination. The same 
sources said the main aim of the interview granted by Joao de 
Matos yesterday was to prepare the ground to camouflage military 
offensives being launched by his troops in various parts of 
Angola, as well as to justify other possible military operations 
against areas controlled by UNITA. The truth is that the main 
intention of the regime's radical wing is to continue fighting, 
although without success, until the hoped for possibility of 
eliminating UNITA, as by Lucio Lara stated in his recent remarks 
in France. The sources from the FALA General Staff call on the 
international community, particularly the United Nations, who 
are mediating the Angolan conflict, to condemn all these 
Machiavellian actions from the Futungo de Belas since they 
considerably endanger the current peace process.

  [Text] Angolan Prime Minister Dr. Marcolino Jose Carlos 
Moco has warned that, though we may be involved in peace talks, 
we must not allow ourselves to become complacent. Prime 
Minister Marcolino Moco said so at a meeting of the Council of 
Ministers Regional Commission for Regional and Local Affairs in 
Luanda today. The meeting was attended by provincial governors 
and the most important issue under discussion was the first 
round of the military draft this year. 
  Addressing the meeting, Prime Minister Marcolino Moco 
categorically stated that the defense of the country will 
continue to be [word indistinct] this year. He noted that, 
quote, we will not be able to survive unless we defend the 
country's territorial integrity and national sovereignty, 
unquote. 
  In its session today, the Council of Ministers Commission 
for 
Regional and Local Affairs decided to start working on a draft 
resolution to be submitted to the National Assembly for 
approval. That draft resolution will request that the drafting 
of young men into the armed forces be done taking into account 
[words indistinct].

  [Text] Angolan Head of State Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
arrived in the French capital earlier this evening. With this 
visit, he hopes to intensify bilateral cooperation in various 
areas. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos last visited Paris in 
August 1991 and even then he paid special attention to French 
businessmen. Three years later, judging by his schedule, he is 
likely to pay them the same attention. There is confirmation 
that he will be meeting with the chairmen of Elf Aquitaine and 
Total companies, as well as representatives from other major 
companies. The Angolan president will, therefore, be seeking to 
consolidate French support for this country. 
  In the political sphere, he is scheduled to meet French 
President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, 
the interior minister, and the cooperation minister. 
  The Angolan head of state's visit to that European country 
is 
scheduled to last three days, during which he will also meet the 
chairman of the French National Assembly, and the leaders of 
France's Socialist and Communist Parties. It should be noted 
that bilateral relations have been reduced somewhat over the 
last three years as a result of Angola's political and military 
crisis. 
  Bilateral cooperation rests mainly on French participation 
in 
oil exploitation -- hence the importance of contacts with Elf 
Aquitaine and Total -- loans, and humanitarian aid.

  [Text] The demobilization of troops from the government and 
the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] will no longer begin 
on 1 March as scheduled. This is because the Finance Ministry 
has not yet received the lists of soldiers from both sides to be 
demobilized. 
  The Finance Ministry has the money to begin to pay the 
six-month subsidy provided by the government and the 18-month 
subsidy provided by the international community. Finance 
Minister Eneas Comiche told Radio Mozambique that the Technical 
Demobilization Unit of the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] 
has already obtained the list of government soldiers to be 
demobilized but has not yet obtained Renamo's list. He said the 
government will only begin to pay the subsidy after his ministry 
has obtained full lists from both sides. 
  The Reintegration Commission [Core] met in Maputo today to 
discuss various issues connected with the strategy to be adopted 
for the reintegration of demobilized troops. Core also examined 
a two-year training program for demobilized troops.

supervise the training of infantry battalions of the new army 
scheduled to begin on 21 March. Colonel John White, British 
military officer in Mozambique, told LUSA that if the request is 
not successful within the next few days the team of two British 
instructors, who arrived in Mozambique in early February, will 
leave the country on 31 March. According to a British project 
for training 15,000 soldiers, who will be part of the first 
infantry battalions of the new unified army, the British 
military team would only follow the training of the first three 
battalions. Then training will be conducted by Mozambican 
instructors trained in Nyanga, Zimbabwe.

  [Text] Walvis Bay Feb 23 SAPA -- About 1,000 looters caused 
damage to property worth R[Rand]500,000 when they ransacked a 
compound in a black township near Walvis Bay on Wednesday [23 
February]. The looting started at Kuisebmond Mill and Salvage 
compound after the crowd, who were apparently looking for a 
place to sleep, overpowered security guards. 
  Joined by compound residents, the mob looted a former hostel 
building of thousands of litres of ice-cream, 12 tons of fish, 
388 beef carcasses, crab meat worth R56,000, eight tons of 
processed mielie meal and R15,000 in cash. The mob then cordoned 
off the building and threw stones at police. 
  Lt Frik Conradie, District Commissioner of the SAP [South 
African Police] in Walvis Bay, said the SAP, accompanied by the 
Namibian police, later brought the situation under control. 
  Businessmen and residents said they were concerned that the 
looting would spill over into the town. No one was arrested.

  [Text] The Zimbabwean Government, which last Friday [18 
February] ordered the dismissal of all striking postal and 
telecommunications workers, yesterday authorized the parastatal 
body to reinstate them and award them a 12.5 percent salary 
increase. The unprecedented move ended a week-long strike that 
paralyzed the country's postal and telecommunication services. 
Ten-thousand-five-hundred workers of the state-owned Post and 
Telecommunications Corporation [PTC] downed their tools last 
Wednesday after management failed to pay them a 12.5 percent 
salary increase backdated to July 1992 and awarded to them by a 
labor tribunal. The PTC refused to pay the increases and 
appealed to the Supreme Court against the labor court ruling. 
Meantime the workers' union leaders instructed all workers not 
to go back to work since theoretically they had been fired.

  [Text] Harare, 23 Feb (NAN/PANA) -- The Cameroonian 
authorities dispatched a high powered government delegation to 
southern African countries to solicit support and understanding 
in the conflict with Nigeria over the disputed Bakassi 
Peninsula. The NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reported from 
Harare on Wednesday [23 February] that the delegation arrived in 
Harare quietly on Sunday aboard a Cameroon Airline aircraft for 
discussions with the Zimbabwean Government over the issue. 
  Diplomatic sources in the region told NAN that the 
Cameroonians opted for the diplomatic move to paint Nigeria as 
an aggressor in the current conflict and to win sympathy among 
the English speaking countries in case the issue was referred to 
the OAU for resolution. 
  Meanwhile, some Nigerians in Zimbabwe have called on the 
Federal Government to give the Cameroonians a bloody nose while 
others called for restraint. A Nigerian lecturer at the 
University of Zimbabwe, Dr. Hameed Nuru, told NAN that Nigeria 
should, at least for once, teach Cameroon a lesson over its 
continued aggressive tendencies over the years. However, 
another lecturer at the university, who declined to be named, 
told NAN that it would be counter productive for Nigeria to go 
to war with Cameroon over the matter as it would only worsen the 
economic situation in both countries.

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, 23 Feb (AFP) -- Somali warlord Mohamed 
Farah Aidid on Wednesday [23 February] said the withdrawal from 
Somalia of western contingents in the UN operation there would 
be good for peace and not lead to factional strife as aid 
workers fear. "The departure of the foreign troops will have 
salutary rather than adverse affects on the search for peace and 
a negotiated political settlement," General Aidid told a press 
conference here in the Kenyan capital. "We are surprised about 
the hysteria being drummed up in the media and in some other 
quarters that the withdrawal of the U.S. troops will somehow 
trigger off sudden explosions of fighting among Somali 
factions," he said. 
  Some 3,000 troops currently remain in Somalia, the spearhead 
of the UN force there, but Washington and other western 
governments plan to pull out their soldiers by the end of March, 
in a move that has sparked fears of renewed heavy fighting in 
the Horn of Africa nation. 
  Aidid, the strongman in much of the capital Mogadishu and 
southern Somalia since 1991, said the prospect for peace was 
"now much better than it was last year," and called for 
continued UN relief assistance to his country, where conflict 
caused widespread famine. "One wonders if (the) doomsayers have 
ever stopped to think what the U.S. troops have been doing in 
Somalia since their arrival, or in what part of the country they 
have been deployed, or whether they have ever separated warring 
factions," Aidid said. [passage omitted] 
  Referring to weekend clashes in the southern port of 
Kismaayo, where some 60 people reportedly died, Aidid said: 
"Kismaayo is on fire, despite a 'peace conference' last year 
orchestrated, choreographed, staged, conducted and starred in by 
UNOSOM (the UN Operation in Somalia)." He added that he was 
ready to meet one of his Somali rivals, General Mohamed Hersi, 
known as Morgan, who is battling his allies for Kismaayo, if his 
grass-roots supporters backed the mood. Peace prevailed where 
no foreign soldiers were deployed, Aidid claimed. 
  "We are aware of the concern by the donor countries about 
the 
security situation in the country and the level of the cost of 
the aid programs," he added. "We wish to assure the donor 
countries, aid workers and all concerned that we will do 
everything possible to improve the situation. We hope the donor 
countries will continue to assist Somalia overcome its current 
difficulties." 
  He stressed that he was "not adverse to the UNOSOM troops 
protecting humanitarian aid as prescribed by the Security 
Council Resolution 897. But there must be humanitarian aid to 
protect." [passage omitted] 
  Aidid said his Somali National Alliance had "advised and 
warned the UN against using the foreign troops as an occupation 
force, against usurping the authority and functions of Somali 
political leaders and against treating Somalia as if it were 
under trusteeship." 
  He had remained in Nairobi for almost three months, after 
the 
UN- sponsored peace conference which ended without agreement, to 
pursue talks with other Somali clan leaders and members, adding 
that while consultations were "time-consuming" they were not 
leading nowhere. Aidid said he was leaving later Wednesday or 
Thursday for Eritrea and talks with President Isayas Afewerki.

  [Text] Yaounde, 23 Feb (AFP) -- At least 50 persons died in 
a village in the Upper North Province of Cameroon on 17 February 
when soldiers opened fire on the people and set fire to their 
houses, it was learned today in Yaounde from well-informed 
sources. 
  This operation carried out against the village of Karena, 
inhabited by Arab-Choa, followed clashes the previous day 
between security forces and "highway bandits" who had come to 
take the people to ransom, these sources added. These clashes 
left three people dead, including a soldier. 
  According to a report from the two Arab-Choa deputies, more 
than 90 villagers had to be admitted to hospital after this 
operation. About 80 of them were sent to Nigerian health centers 
at the border of the two countries.

  [Text] Monrovia, 23 Feb (AFP) -- Today, the Liberian 
interim government, the Interim National Government of National 
Unity [IGNU] accused the main armed faction, the National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], of "kidnapping" on 20 
February a top official of the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL], 
the armed wing of IGNU, at the Firestone rubber plantation 
located some 50 km from Monrovia. 
  Colonel Saykagepo Kortor, deputy chief of the AFL 
intelligence service, was arrested along with his three 
bodyguards and driver, who was released, the interim government 
defense minister disclosed. According to the driver, the four 
soldiers were arrested after going through the last checkpoint 
manned by the African peacekeeping force in Liberia, Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group 
[ECOMOG], in the Firestone plantation, which marks the entrance 
into an NPFL-controlled zone. 
  This arrest occurs at a time when the disarmament of the 
Liberian armed factions is scheduled to start in less than two 
weeks, in accordance with a new agreement signed last week in 
Monrovia between the main factions in the Liberian conflict -- 
the interim government, the NPFL, and the United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO]. IGNU has called on 
ECOMOG and the UN military observers "to ensure the safety and 
release of the AFL soldiers." For its part, ULIMO has issued an 
ultimatum to NPFL to release Col. Kortor and his men "within 48 
hours" or face "reprisals."

  [Text] Discussions on national reconciliation continue at a 
standstill in Lusaka, Zambia. Every day a new pretext emerges, 
thus retarding the peace talks. There are changes after changes 
just because the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] makes demands that are difficult to meet. Our 
correspondent Joao Ligio reports. 
  The mediators continued their separate consultations today 
in 
search of details to draw up the third version of specific 
principles. It is thought that this third version could be part 
of tomorrow's proceedings. If that happens, it will be one step 
forward. 
  What was not taken into consideration, however, was the 
demand by Jonas Savimbi's followers that as long as the 
government does not say something about recent statements made 
by deputy Lucio Lara and General Joao de Matos, the peace talks 
will not move forward. Alioune Blondin Beye, special 
representative of the UN secretary general, brushed aside the 
demand, recalling that it has already been accepted and signed 
that events outside Lusaka should not disturb the course of the 
peace talks. To overcome this tense atmosphere, Alioune Blondin 
Beye had to place the Black Cockerel's men between a rock and a 
hard place, exhibiting a new document entitled Guiding Document. 
In this document, the mediators outline all points that the 
parties must take into consideration. This new form of 
undertaking involving signatures is aimed at preventing the 
parties from recanting previous protocols, and it is viewed as a 
compulsory guideline.

  [Text] Kimberley Feb 23 SAPA -- Shots were fired and stones 
thrown at Deputy Minister Chris Fismer in the coloured township 
of Roodepan near Kimberley at a rally on Wednesday night. Mr 
Fismer was pelted with stones and he and security men had to 
leave a rally intended for NP [National Party] leader and State 
President F W de Klerk. 
  According to security officers accompanying the president, 
shots were fired in a crowd of opposing African National 
Congress [ANC] and National Party supporters. No further 
details were immediately available. 
  Mr Fismer had gone to address the meeting to explain why 
President de Klerk had canceled his appearance there, a police 
spokesman said. It was then that stones were thrown at the 
stage. There were strong ANC and NP support groups present at 
the rally. Mr de Klerk was earlier advised not to attend the 
rally as all access roads were being blocked by ANC 
stonethrowers.

  [Text] Kimberley Feb 23 SAPA -- One woman was killed and an 
unknown number of people injured in a shooting incident at a 
National Party [NP] rally in Roodepan coloured township near 
Kimberley on Wednesday night. 
  Shots were fired and stones thrown when Deputy Minister 
Chris 
Fismer arrived at the rally to explain President F W de Klerk's 
failure to arrive as scheduled. 
  According to security officers accompanying the president, 
shots were fired in a crowd of opposing African National 
Congress [ANC] and National Party supporters. There were strong 
ANC and NP support groups present at the rally. 
  Mr de Klerk was earlier advised not to attend the rally as 
all access roads were being blocked by ANC stonethrowers. 
Later, Mr Fismer, chief organiser of the presidential election 
tour, confirmed the shootings and stonings and said it was clear 
since the party put up posters for the two rallies, that firm 
decisions had been taken to prevent the NP from holding their 
meetings. 
  It was a serious problem facing this election and the NP was 
going to take up the matter at every possible level. Giving his 
own account of events, he said he had gone to Roodepan after Mr 
de Klerk's meeting in the Kimberley City Hall to establish 
precisely what the situation was. 
  On the way there, he had seen large numbers of black people, 
moving from Galeshiwe township to Roodepan, jumping on every 
conceivable means of transport. 
  He said that on arrival at the grounds, everything seemed to 
be in order with the NP band playing and NP supporters clearly 
in the majority. He said, however, that police reported a large 
number of ANC supporters had gathered between the houses to rush 
the state president on his arrival. 
  That made him decide to "test the temperature" of the 
meeting. A squad of ANC supporters then rushed the stage and 
stones started flying. Soon shots were fired. He believed the 
stones came from all directions and security men ushered him and 
other NP officials away. 
  Later police reported that an unidentified woman had been 
killed and several others were injured. No further details were 
available. 
  It was also confirmed in Kimberley by Mr de Klerk that he 
had 
been "struck by a projectile" at Postdene on Wednesday 
afternoon. Although police believe it was a crumpled paper flag, 
a television news cameraman said he had footage to show that Mr 
de Klerk had been struck on the neck by a stone.

  [Excerpt] Johannesburg Feb 24 SAPA -- The son-in-law of a 
National Party [NP] member of Parliament has been arrested and 
charged with murder following the death of a 37-year old woman 
in the Roodepan township near Kimberley late on Wednesday [23 
February]. The woman was killed when shooting broke out between 
NP and African National Congress [ANC] supporters at an NP rally. 
  Police said Isghak Adams, son-in-law of Howard Isaacs, an NP 
deputy for the diamand district of the Northern Cape, was 
formally charged before a magistrate at midnight on Wednesday. 
He was granted bail and released. [passage omitted] 
  Minister of Law and Order Hernus Kriel said that unless the 
ANC took immediate and credible steps to control its supporters, 
South Africa's first democratic elections were in danger of 
degenerating into bloody chaos. In a statement, Mr Kriel said 
the intimidation and violence of especially ANC supporters was 
already extensively hindering free political activity. 
  "The ANC's persistent refusal to discipline its violent 
supporters has created the potential for widespread violence 
wherever other political parties seek to exercise their right to 
free political activity," Mr Kriel said.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 24 SAPA -- The Democratic Party 
[DP] on Thursday [24 February] condemned incidents leading to 
the shooting of a woman at a National Party rally on Wednesday. 
In a statement, the DP said all political parties had the right 
to campaign where they wanted to. "Establishing no-go zones for 
any political party will make it extremely difficult for the 
elections to be free and fair," the statement said. It called 
on political parties and their leaders to accept the 
responsibility of educating and controlling their supporters. 
The police were also urged to monitor the carrying of weapons 
by supporters and bystanders at campaigns and rallies.

  [Text] Postmasburg Feb 23 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk 
was struck by a crumpled paper flag and stick while speaking to 
a crowd dominated by vociferous African National Congress [ANC] 
protesters at Postdene near Postmasburg in the Northern Cape on 
Wednesday. The incident went largely unnoticed. 
  ANC supporters had been ripping paper flags glued to wooden 
sticks from National Party supporters' hands, and tearing or 
crumpling them. One of these was thrown at Mr de Klerk from 
behind, hitting him on the neck. 
  There were a few minor scuffles as security men hastily 
ushered Mr de Klerk's party out of the area. 
  Mr de Klerk said afterwards: "One continues to be shocked by 
ill-mannered and ill-directed leaders who prevent a leader from 
addressing his followers. 
  "It is proof of a chilling fact: the ANC has lost control 
over its youthful followers." He said all those who shouted and 
jeered at him at Postdene were youngsters. 
  "I think it is high time that the Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] now focus on one of its two main tasks, namely 
to prevent intimidation." The IEC's other task was to manage the 
election. 
  Mr de Klerk said case upon case of sheer intimidation had 
been brought to the attention of the IEC, with affidavits on 
specific incidents, but no action had been taken as they were 
"too vague". "Today I have been witness to people issued with 
official ANC flags, placards and banners disrupting a legal 
meeting of NP supporters." 
  He said if the IEC needed a witness, they were welcome to 
contact him. "They have the fiscal powers and I call upon them 
to use these powers."

  [Text] Durban Feb 24 SAPA -- Three Natal Midlands Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] leaders have been arrested in connection 
with last weekend's massacre of 15 African National Congress 
[ANC] supporters at Mahehle near Creighton in Natal, the IFP 
said on Thursday [24 February]. 
  Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo confirmed one man had been 
arrested and two were being questioned in connection with 
Saturday morning's attack on a group preparing for a voter 
education workshop. 
  One was due to appear in Ixopo Magistrate's Court on 
Thursday 
afternoon, police said. 
  In a statement, the IFP condemned "the arrest of three 
prominent IFP leaders", describing the police action as a 
"transparent attempt to placate the African National Congress 
leadership". The arrests were a "cynical political ploy by the 
South African Police's [SAP] Gen Johan Meintjies (Natal's CID 
[Criminal Investigation Division] chief) to appease the ANC and 
take the pressure off the SAP". 
  "This token action by the SAP not only poses a grave threat 
to the IFP in the region but also has important political 
implications given other actions by the SAP in this area against 
the IFP and its leadership," it said. 
  The three leaders had repeatedly been harassed by an SAP 
unit 
based in Port Shepstone, the IFP claimed. 
  "The IFP calls for the release or charging of its leaders 
and 
the immediate replacement of the head of the investigation team 
responsible for this absurd action." 
  ANC Midlands Secretary Sifiso Nkabinde said he was pleased 
with the arrests: "The whole world is now going to see who is 
behind these massacres." 
  Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said the matter now lay 
with 
the court.

Gora Ebrahim he had encouraged the PAC to do what it could to 
bring all political parties into the election. 
  On his meeting later in the day with right-wing leaders, Dr. 
Salim said: "I am looking forward to meeting them. They 
represent a constituency".

  [Text] Concern was expressed in business circles today over 
the effects which the political situation in the country could 
have on the economy. The South African Chamber of Business 
[SACOB], which has been playing a mediating role behind the 
scenes, has called on politicians to do everything possible on 
the eve of the parliamentary session to involve all political 
parties in the election. Chamber President Mr. Frederick Savage 
said in an open letter to politicians that SACOB supports strong 
regional government and has been encouraged by progress made in 
this direction. He said international mediation must be 
seriously considered if a settlement cannot be achieved. 
  Organization of African Unity [OAU] Secretary General Dr. 
Salim Ahmed Salim also played a mediating role in talks today 
with leaders of the African National Congress [ANC], the 
Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC], and the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front, AVF]. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Ronel van Zyl] Since his 
arrival in South Africa yesterday Dr. Salim has been saying that 
everything possible must be done to persuade all parties to 
participate in the election. The whole continent's eyes are 
focused on South Africa. ANC President Nelson Mandela told Dr. 
Salim in Johannesburg that threats by the right wing over the 
election must not be underestimated. He added that negotiations 
will continue in an attempt to find a solution and allay their 
fears. In Dr. Salim's meeting with the PAC later, the 
organization's mediation role came up for discussion. 
  [Salim, in English] I've encouraged the PAC to do what they 
can towards the participation of all the political forces in the 
country, in the democratic elections. 
  [Van Zyl] PAC Deputy President Mr. Johnson Mlambo confirmed 
that his organization has held several meetings with the Inkatha 
Freedom Party. 
  [Mlambo, in English] Our efforts are continuing on that 
front, to try and get them and all other parties involved in the 
process. 
  [Van Zyl] A follow-up meeting will probably take place later 
this week. Before his departture, Dr. Salim signed a 
condolences book for the late APLA [Azanian People's Liberation 
Army -- PAC military wing] Commander Sabelo Phama. In Pretoria 
this evening Dr. Salim held discussions with AVF leader General 
Constand Viljoen and other members of the front. Dr. Salim 
conveyed to General Viljoen the OAU's stance on the latest 
developments in the contry. In turn, General Viljoen gave the 
reasons why the front has not yet committed itself to 
participation in the April election. He then explained to Dr. 
Salim the right-wing Afrikaners' demand for a homeland. 
  [Viljoen, in English] We will have a homeland, and in the 
homeland we will be part of Africa. We'll be a very valuable 
partner of the new South Africa, if the Afrikaners can settle 
down and be peaceful in their own homeland. 
  [Salim, in English] I think that the Afrikaner people in 
this 
country can play a very significant contribution with in the 
context of a united South Africa. We feel very strongly on the 
question of unity of this country. We believe all the ethnic 
groups and all the people of all colors, of all creeds, can be 
accomodated in South Africa. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By G. van Oudtshoorn] </F>
  [Text] Ulundi Feb 23 SAPA -- Describing the approved 
amendments to the constitution as a concession to the Freedom 
Alliance [FA] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] was an insult 
not only to his intelligence but to the IFP and all South 
Africans, Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Wednesday [23 February]. 
The IFP president was commenting on amendments to Section 126 of 
the interim constitution adopted by the Multiparty Negotiation 
Council on Monday which were described by the African National 
Congress [ANC] as a major concession to the federalistic demands 
of the FA. 
  "Once again the press has failed to exercise its duty of 
critique, analysis and investigation and has reported the 
propagandistic untruth of the ANC/SA Communist Party alliance 
and the National Party/South African Government at face value," 
Mr Buthelezi said. 
  "Upon analysis it appears clear and incontrovertible that 
describing the amendments to Section 126 as a concession to the 
Freedom Alliance and the IFP is an insult to my intelligence, is 
an insult to the intelligence of my party and is an insult to 
the intelligence to all South Africans. 
  "All they did was to delete the word 'concurrent' and add 
language which unequivocally ensures that powers of the 
provinces can only be concurrent rather than exclusive. The 
normative value of Section 126 before the amendment is exactly 
the same as after the amendment." 
  Mr Buthelezi said it was stated in the amendment that 
provincial legislatures would have competence to make laws as in 
the limited list of powers set out in Schedule 6, and that 
parliament would be competent to make the same laws with regard 
to the same matters on which provinces had jurisdiction. 
  Parliament therefore had concurrent legislative powers over 
the same matters. In case the two legislative powers cannot 
co-exist without creating a conflict with one another, the act 
of Parliament would prevail over the provincial legislation "in 
substantially the same cases and situations". 
  "In fact the national government is entitled to prevail with 
its legislation over provincial legislation on the basis of 
about 15 broadly worded over-rides," Mr Buthelezi said. "This 
means that in a province there will be national schools, 
hospital and housing programmes co-existing with provincial 
schools, hospitals and housing programmes." 
  He said the national government would have the power to 
extend the rules set out for national schools, hospitals and 
housing programmes and every time it could argue that it did so 
on the basis of one of the broadly worded 15 over-rides. 
"Needless to say, the national schools, hospital and housing 
programmes will be backed by respective national health, 
educational and housing policies, which will make any effort in 
such fields by the provinces politically and socially irrelevant. 
  "I am saying this because unless our press accepts the duty 
of going into this type of detail, there will not be correct 
information on the truth of the constitutional negotiations 
which took place in this country," Mr Buthelezi said.

Force] with the joint military coordinating council concerning 
the implementation of a new national Defense Force. Mr. Mandela

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 23 SAPA -- The National 
Peacekeeping Force [NPF] was not by itself going to be able to 
provide security for the April election and voters would have to 
rely largely on the security forces, African National Congress 
Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said on Wednesday [23 
February]. Addressing about 2,000 residents in the coloured 
township of Ennerdale, south of Johannesburg, Mr Ramaphosa said 
the way things were developing the NPF would barely have enough 
troops ready to provide one soldier per polling booth, whereas 
there should be at least 15. 
  It would not be easy to convince the presently very cautious 
international community to send enough, if any, peacekeeping 
soldiers. "So we are going to have to rely on the security 
forces." 
  There were some defence force and police members who would 
be 
unwilling to protect the interim constitution or those who 
wished to vote, but there were many, especially black security 
force members, who would be. Besides this, said Mr Rampahosa, 
"we must each become peace-keepers ourselves."

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 23 SAPA--No aspect of the African 
National Congress [ANC] could be described as communist in spite 
of the ANC's alliance with the South African Communist Party 
[SACP], ANC national Chairman Thabo Mbeki told a Davis Borkhum 
Hare breakfast at the Transvaal Automobile Club in Johannesburg 
on Wednesday. The proceedings, broadcast live on M-Net [Media 
Network], were attended by leading businessmen, diplomats and 
politicians. 
  Asked to outline the ANC's stance on nationalisation, Mr 
Mbeki said the ANC did not have a policy of nationalisation but 
would consider state control if it achieved a particular policy 
objective. "The ANC has no policy to nationalise any bank or 
industry or mine. What we are saying is that these are 
instruments of policy. One may decide to privatise a company but 
the matter is not approached as an ideology or a policy. 
  "If in the pursuit of a particular policy objective it can 
be 
shown that the objective can be achieved by putting company x in 
state hands, then of course we would consider it." 
  He said the ANC intended to bring an end to the violence 
because this was crucial in attracting foreign investment that 
was necessary for job creation. 
  Constitutional concessions offered the Freedom Alliance 
should be sufficient to ensure its participation in the 
elections. The changes had been painful to the ANC but were 
necessary to achieve stability. 
  Economic growth would be central to an anc government. A 
democratic settlement had to be underwritten by a programme that 
improved the lives of the poor. 
  "Something has to happen to guarantee the permanance of the 
democratic settlement." 
  The ANC would initiate a public works programme and 
restructure the budget to realise its objectives within current 
state revenue projections. 
  In reply to another question, Mr Mbeki said it was not 
inevitable that South Africa would decline in the way some 
African countries had done. It would be foolish not to learn 
from the mistakes of other African countries, he said.

  [Text] Umtata Feb 22 SAPA -- Transkei leader Maj-Gen Bantu 
Holomisa on Tuesday [22 February] scotched speculation that he 
might step down as head of the territory's military council to 
concentrate on fighting the election for the African National 
Congress [ANC]. 
  He told a press conference in Umtata he would stay on as 
head 
of state in spite of a busy campaign schedule that starts with a 
visit to the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] this 
weekend. "During the election campaign I will continue in my 
present position as chairman of the ruling military council and 
attend to state matters as is applicable to other heads of 
government in southern Africa or in South Africa such as 
(President F W) de Klerk." 
  Gen Holomisa, who is on the ANC's list for the national 
assembly, said the election campaign would be used to inform 
"locals" of the impending end of the homeland system and of 
homeland government. His participation on an ANC ticket did not 
imply other political organisations in the territory would be 
exposed to unfair treatment. 
  Whatever the Transitional Executive Council and independent 
electoral commission put forward to ensure free political 
activity would be implemented in Transkei. "Personally I'm an 
advocate of free politicking...not even the TEC will teach 
Holomisa and his government how to be tolerant." 
  He said the shift from being a military ruler to campaigning 
for the ANC would mean he would have to submit to party 
discipline and not use "dictatorial terms". Gen Holomisa will 
campaign in all four provinces in the run-up to the elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Stephe Laufer] </F>
  [Text] ANC Treasurer General Thomas Nkobi admitted this 
week the organisation was struggling to finance the critical 
last 10 weeks of the election campaign. "We are managing to pay 
salaries at the moment, but the election is a problem," said 
Nkobi. "We have not reached our target of $17-million 
(R[rand]58.3-million) in contributions from the international 
community, and we are afraid to borrow -- because of course we 
would have to pay for it." 
  The $17-million international fundraising target is believed 
to be significantly lower than originally planned. Fundraisers 
on both sides of the Atlantic are locked in a battle with the 
ANC's chief Washington representative, Lindiwe Mabuza, over 
large American campaign donations promised to Nelson Mandela, 
but never received by ANC headquarters. 
  At stake are millions of U.S. dollars. Repeated requests to 
Mabuza to transfer the funds, raised during Mandela's U.S. trip 
last July, have fallen on deaf ears, say sources in the U.S. and 
South Africa. 
  Mabuza refused this week to discuss the issue when 
telephoned 
in Washington, saying she was answerable only to the ANC 
leadership. "I don't want to discuss this in the media," said 
Mabuza. "I don't even know really how much was transferred or 
not -- I don't keep the books." 
  The election cash crunch would be eased, say insiders, if 
Mabuza were to transfer almost $500,000 (R1.7-million) in cash 
and cheques raised during Nelson Mandela's U.S. trip last July. 
A further $1.8- million (R6.2-million) in pledges has also 
failed to materialise, because Mabuza has not followed up on the 
promises made to Mandela. Mabuza, who has been nominated to a 
safe position within the top 102 on the ANC's list for the 
national parliament, is understood to be the sole signatory to 
the organisation's Washington bank accounts. The $500,000 was 
deposited after Mandela's fundraising swing last year, which 
took him to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and other centres. 
  Asked about his department's difficulties with Mabuza, Nkobi 
was unspecific, saying "Nelson Mandela brought about $10,000 
(34,300) back with him" after the July U.S. trip, and the "most 
of the rest was pledges which are not being fulfilled". 
  An audit of the ANC's Stockholm office while Mabuza was 
chief 
representative in Sweden several years ago apparently revealed a 
gap of several tens of thousands of Swedish krona between amount 
paid by local donors to the ANC and expenditure records kept by 
the office. 
  Confronted over the hole in the till, Mabuza is reported to 
have burst into tears, saying she knew nothing about accounting. 
Asked about the audit this week, she denied any knowledge of a 
cash shortfall, saying: "I am aware there was an audit, but I 
was not told that figure was missing." 
  An attempt to transfer her to Dar es Salaam as chief 
representative to Tanzania failed when she successfully lobbied 
for the Washington D.C. position. She is said to have an 
"inside track" to foreign affairs chief Thabo Mbeki. But far 
from winning friends and influencing people in the U.S. capital, 
Mabuza is reported to have thrown her lot in with some dubious 
Capitol Hill entrepreneurs and put several important noses out 
of joint. Sources in the U.S. say she has angered ANC donors 
and sympathisers by "trying to hog everything for herself" 
rather than leaving fundraising to the professionals. 
  One American source, who asked to remain anonymous, said she 
had failed to prevent turf battles between two ANC-aligned 
fundraising operations, and "funds raised have not found their 
way back to South Africa". 
  "There is definite incompetence within the Washington 
office, 
and it needs better financial controls -- even outside the issue 
of fundraising. The fault lies with the organisation at large," 
said a source. A fundraising effort set up to encourage large 
tax- deductible contributions from corporate donors and chaired 
by Heinz chief Tony O'Rielly, who recently bought a major stake 
in South Africa's Argus newspapers, has reportedly been using 
its clout to raise funds from traditional ANC donors like 
churches and black groups. 
  Called Safe -- for South Africa Free Elections -- the 
organisation was set up with Mandela's blessing and the 
involvement of the ANC in an attempt to mobilise U.S. funding 
for voter education projects. Pro bono legal services were 
provided by former Kennedy aide Theodore Sorensen. 
  U.S. law makes makes tax-deductible donations to political 
parties impossible, and the clear expectation was that Safe 
would fund voter education projects close to, but not 
organisationally linked to, the ANC. But aside from minor 
amounts which have gone to ANC partners within the Patriotic 
Front, Safe has ended up supporting voter education projects 
beyond the ANC orbit to the tune of at least $1-million 
(R3.4-million). Among those receiving support is the Institute 
for a Democratic Alternative in South Africa (Idasa). 
  Considering the use of Mandela's high profile for Safe's 
fundraising effort, said one U.S. source, "anger is justified if 
ANC-related voter education is not getting the funds". Mabuza 
was also instrumental in brokering a contract between the ANC 
and former non-voting congressional delegate for Washington D.C. 
Walter Fauntroy, for "the provision of public policy, political 
action, public relations, mobilisation and other services to 
assist the ANC mission to the U.S.". 
  The initial proposal included a draft first year budget of 
$700,000, (R2.4 million) and requested a three-month start-up 
planning grant of $230,000 (770,000). Fauntroy was to cover 
these costs through fundraising in the U.S., but has not 
remitted a cent to the ANC. Instead, the start-up grant has 
been lost, putting the ANC more than $230,000 out of pocket. 
  Mabuza has also pushed other associates at the ANC's 
expense, 
including one Albert Nellum, who came to South Africa with his 
wife, ostensibly because there was an "urgent need" to plan 
fundraising events around a tennis match involving Zina 
Garrison. Nellum is described as "a very close friend of 
Lindiwe and the godfather of Zina Garrison". Mabuza was told 
twice by fax not to approve Nellum's visit, but he came anyway, 
billing the ANC for his room at the Carlton Hotel and for air 
fares for himself and his wife, which he insisted on having 
upgraded to business class. Asked to comment on the goings-on 
in the Washington D.C. office, an spokesman said: "We don't deal 
with election fundraising -- that's the treasurer's and the 
election campaign department's responsibility. We have no cause 
to be unhappy with our representation in D.C."

<F P=106> [Report by Helen Grange] </F>
  [Text] Taxpayers and foreign governments will foot the bill 
for electioneering by registered political parties, each of 
which gets an equal financial injection despite the differences 
in their support levels. One condition, however, is that they 
produce an opinion poll showing they have at least 2 percent 
support regionally or nationally. 
  According to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), the 
electoral fund -- consisting of State funds and donations from 
the international community -- has been divided in two. One 
half is earmarked for pre-election campaigning and the other for 
parties gaining seats in Parliament afterwards. 
  If a party produces a petition with at least 10,000 
signatures instead of an opinion poll attesting to at least 2 
percent support, it will be entitled to half the full money 
grant. A party standing regionally only, and showing a 2 
percent or more support poll, can get a quarter of the grant. A 
party standing regionally only, and showing a 2 percent or more 
support poll, can get a quarter of the grant. If it can only 
raise signatures -- at least 3,000 are needed for a regional 
party -- it will get one-eighth of the amount. 
  The second half of the electoral fund has also been divided 
in two, with 25 percent earmarked for parties which obtain one 
or more seats (they will get equal amounts) and another 25 
percent to be distributed between parties in Parliament on a 
proportional basis depending on support. "In other words, the 
smaller parties, while they might get the same amount as the 
bigger parties initially, will end up with much less at the end 
of the election process," the IEC said. 
  Aside from the fund, each political party is being funded by 
its own donors. The ANC, in particular, is receiving 
substantial assistance from foreign governments. Sources could 
not give a figure for the amount in the electoral fund, but it 
is expected that each voter will cost a party between R[rand]1 
and R3 in campaign money. There are 22 million eligible voters.

<F P=106> [Interview with PAC President Clarence Makwetu by Tos </F>
Wentzel; place and date not given] 
  [Text] On the state of support for the parties in the 
election campaign, especially in view of the fact that opinion 
polls suggest that the PAC's [Pan-Africanist Congress] support 
is very low: 
  The problem with the opinion polls is that they have never 
been accurate. For instance, for the last elections in Britain 
they said the Labour Party was winning. Before the first 
elections in Zimbabwe they predicted that Nkomo and Muzorewa 
would win. In my own experience the opinion polls have never 
been very accurate. Secondly we do not know what criteria were 
used. We do not know who was approached. For instance I have 
never been approached by the so-called analysts. It seems as if 
the bulk of the electorate is never canvassed, hence the 
discrepancies. We are working with the grassroots we know who 
they are supporting and why (PAC support) is far higher and 
everybody will be shocked by the election result. Our aim is not 
to come with claims of support but to win the election. We are 
not coming up with predictions. 
  On the structure of the PAC and rumours that the PAC is 
cash- strapped: 
  The PAC has never been a rich organisation, but we manage 
somehow because we work with our people and they are the people 
who are supporting the organisation. There is talk that the 
playing field should be levelled for the election but this is 
mere talk. We don't see this in practice. What you are 
witnessing is the international community together with big 
business and the media supporting one party, the ANC [African 
National Congress]. Yet these are the people who are said to be 
promoting multiparty democracy. We feel that in the long run 
our country will be turned into a one-party state under this 
arrangement. 
  On whether ANC promises to the electorate are 
realistic: 
  Our position is that we don't have all the answers. We are 
putting our case to the people to come forward with their ideas 
so that we can see what we can implement. The ANC is talking 
about millions of houses, of jobs etc...(this) is dangerous. 
  On the position of APLA [Azanian People's Liberation 
Army] and the possibility of resuming the armed struggle: 
  We did not willingly embark on armed struggle. We were 
forced into it. But if we are forced to again, we will have to 
consider that position. If our demands on a number of issues 
are not met...we have been economically exploited, politically 
oppressed and socially degraded. Unless that situation is 
addressed we can never say our country has been freed. 
  On whether the PAC leadership has control over 
APLA: 
  The highest organ of the PAC is the national conference. 
This is the body that gives the money to APLA. 
  But it is not the policy of the PAC that APLA should be 
obliged to tell us who they are going to strike and where. 
These are the details that are left to APLA. 
  On the question of land redistribution, whether it 
applies to blacks only and how it is to be achieved: 
  We don't have blacks in the PAC, only the African people. 
The African people have been deprived of their birthright for 
centuries and this is the situation we are promising our people 
to address immediately we are in power. There are various ways 
of doing it. There are various instruments that can be applied. 
For instance, we don't talk of nationalisation. In countries 
where it has been applied it had the tendency of robbing the 
elite for the benefit of another elite, not the grassroots 
people who have had promises made to them. 
  On the controversy about the slogan "one settler, one 
bullet" and the PAC leadership's attitude to it: 
  Firstly, it is not the PAC that has initiated this term 
settler. It is the whites themselves, but when we call them 
settlers they get annoyed. If you go to Grahamstown today you 
will find a monument to the 1820 British settlers. It was not 
the PAC or APLA who named them settlers. If you drive from D.F. 
Malan airport to Cape Town you drive along Settlers Way and it 
was not the PAC again who called that road Settlers Way. Near 
Pretoria there is a small town called Settlers and once again 
PAC and APLA had nothing to do with this. 
  On whether the term does not have a racist 
connotation: 
  It has no racist connotation whatsoever. According to our 
definition the African is the aboriginal of this country. All 
who show allegiance to Africa and are prepared to abide by the 
rule of the African majority are Africans regardless of colour. 
We do not look at your complexion whatsoever. We do not have 
the word "black" in the PAC. 
  On the future: 
  One has to hope that the elections will be free and fair but 
I am afraid that up this moment I do not think that will be the 
position. The PAC has committed itself already that we will 
honour the results of that election if they are free and fair. 
But in order for elections to be free and fair the playing 
fields should be levelled now, and not after the elections. 
This is what is not taking place in our country at the moment. 
The media is totally opposed to certain parties especially the 
PAC. The business community and international community has the 
same attitude. I don't know how the playing fields can be 
levelled unless those attitudes are changed. 
  On whether he has the time to relax and how he does 
it: 
  There is very little time for me to really relax these days 
because I have so many engagements. I happened to be a farmer 
but now that belongs to the past because I no longer have time. 
I do a little reading whenever I have time but I seldom do. I 
am always engaged. I read everything I can lay my hands on. I 
love history.

<F P=106> [Interview with PAC President Clarence Makwetu by announcer </F>
John Bishop on the "Agenda" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Bishop] A very good evening. Tonight the spotlight 
falls on PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] President Clarence 
Makwetu. As you probably know, at the weekend the PAC released 
its election manifesto. Well, Mr. Makwetu is with us in the 
studio this evening. A very good evening and a warm welcome. 
Thanks for joining us, Mr. Makwetu. 
  [Makwetu] Good evening. 
  [Bishop] A couple of soft questions first before I bowl you 
a 
fast and hard one. What are your particular qualities that make 
you the leader and acceptable to the people? What would you say 
they were? 
  [Makwetu] Well, I don't think I have any particular 
qualities. Actually, I was forced into this position. I never 
aspired to it. I never canvassed anyone, but I was at a congress 
that was held here in Johannesburg and they decided to elect me 
to this position. 
  [Bishop] A modest response. What about chances of the PAC in 
these forthcoming elections? Prediction polls say about 2 
percent to 4 percent. What do you say? 
  [Makwetu] Don't worry about prediction polls. This has 
happened in the past. We have seen it in various countries, for 
instance in Britain last time we were told that the Labor Party 
was winning and the Conservatives are in power. Next door here 
in Zimbabwe, before Mugabe came into power we were told that it 
was Joshua Nkomo or Bishop Muzorewa, and right here next door 
again in Lesotho, we were told...[pauses] nothing was mentioned 
about BCP [Basotholand Congress Party] until election results 
were announced. So we are not bothered. Not because of this 
history that I related to you, but because of the amount of work 
we have done in the country. We are happy about what we have 
done in the country. 
  [Bishop] You are widespread in the country? 
  [Makwetu] Throughout the country, we are represented. 
  [Bishop] Now, only last Sunday, and I'll give you a quote, 
you said, if I am reporting you correctly, that you suspended 
the arms struggle but the PAC would return to the arms struggle 
if the land was not returned to the African people. Is that 
right? 
  [Makwetu] Yes, that is the position. 
  [Bishop] You'll also know that you registered as a political 
party, and could it not be said that you are now forbidden from 
making such statements because of the Electoral Act -- 
threatening armed struggle? 
  [Makwetu] We are not threatening anybody. In fact we were 
involved in the armed struggle because we were forced into it by 
the regime. If anybody forces us to armed struggle, we will 
resort to armed struggle. 
  [Bishop] You don't see that though as in any way 
contravening 
the Electoral Act, you know, your statement? 
  [Makwetu] No. 
  [Bishop] Have you been approached by anybody who has 
challenged you on that? 
  [Makwetu] You are the first one to challenge me. 
  [Bishop] And if somebody official challenged you, what would 
you say? 
  [Makwetu] Well, we would look into the legal consequences of 
that. 
  [Bishop] Well, another quote from Mr. Nemadzivhanani, the 
secretary general of the PAC. I think you'll probably know it. 
It was in all the papers. He said unless the elections are 
rigged the PAC will win. 
  [Makwetu] Yes, he said so. 
  [Bishop] You endorse that? Unless those elections are rigged 
the PAC will win. 
  [Makwetu] We are sure to win, that's why he said so. 
  [Bishop] I see, but what I'm going to say is that if the 
election is free and fair and the PAC doesn't win, how can the 
elections have been rigged? If the election monitors, the 
international people and everybody else say: no, no, no, there's 
no rigging. We're very sorry Mr. Makwetu, you have not won the 
election. What will your reaction be then? 
  [Makwetu] But we have committed ourselves already to that, 
in 
that we said if the elections are free and fair we will respect 
the outcome of the election. That's what we have said. 
  [Bishop] No, I do accept that, but you see I'm quoting Mr. 
Nemadzivhanani and he says unless the elections are rigged, in 
other words, I take it to be only rigged elections would mean 
that the PAC couldn't win. Is that not what he meant? 
  [Makwetu] Well, I think what he meant is what is happening 
in 
the country right now. For instance, we were raided in May last 
year, our offices and our houses. Documents that we were using 
and that we should be using right now at the World Trade Center 
were taken away from us and those documents are still with the 
regime. Isn't that the rigging of elections? 
  [Bishop] Well, I am not going to respond to that. The regime 
must respond, as you call them, to that. 
  [Makwetu] Exactly. 
  [Bishop] Mr. Makwetu, Patricia de Lille, her statement made 
quite a lot of press and she has since made another comment 
about it. I am talking about saying that whites who wish to 
emigrate should be encouraged to do so. Do you endorse that 
sentiment? 
  [Makwetu] Well, according to the information I have, and 
this 
information I got from her, she says she has been misquoted. 
She never uttered such words. PAC has no program to drive 
whites into the sea. PAC has no program to drive anybody out of 
this country. 
  [Bishop] Didn't Mr. Barney Desai say something about whites 
going into the sea though, also quoted last week? What do these 
phrases mean, you see? 
  [Makwetu] Well, they may mean anything in politics. For 
instance, if I say I fight elections it doesn't mean I am 
fighting you physically, but I am fighting. 
  [Bishop] No, quite. But let's stay with the whites for a 
minute because I suppose there are quite a few whites watching 
and would like to know their position should the PAC come in and 
form a government. Now, who are whites as far as you are 
concerned. Are they forever settlers or not? 
  [Makwetu] Firstly, I must state that we have never labeled 
anybody as settlers. It is the settlers themselves who have 
called themselves settlers, and I'm going to quote instances. 
For instance, if you go to Grahamstown today you will find a 
monument named 1820 British Settlers. That monument was not 
named by PAC. If you move from D.F. Malan Airport into Cape 
Town, you'll travel along Settlers Way, and that was not named 
by PAC. 
  [Bishop] Well, we are actually in the manifesto now because 
in the glossary you mention settler, and it's defined by the PAC 
as any person who does not owe allegiance to Africa and is not 
willing to submit to rule by an African majority. 
  [Makwetu] That's right. 
  [Bishop] And you also say the term applies to anyone who 
espouses and promotes Eurocentric and colonialist values. 
  [Makwetu] Exactly. 
  [Bishop] Are those European, Eurocentric values of no value 
to Africa? Let me name some of them perhaps: democracy, freedom 
of expression, freedom of assembly, the rule of law, habeas 
corpus, great international music, and eternal poetry and 
literature. Aren't those of value to people who would call 
themselves truly Africans? 
  [Makwetu] All these values you have enumerated are no 
monopoly of Europe. We were not taught democracy by Europe. 
  [Bishop] Is that so? 
  [Makwetu] Yes. 
  [Bishop] It's thought that democracy originated in any kind 
of recent form, by recent I mean two and a half thousand years, 
in ancient Greece. You'd challenge that, would you? 
  [Makwetu] I have no business to challenge that, but we 
practiced democracy before the advent of the whites in this 
country. 
  [Bishop] But then the European values then, let's just get 
to 
that Mr. Makwetu, I mean, what must we do with those. I mean, 
should they be jettisoned for other values? 
  [Makwetu] Not necessarily jettisoned, but values are values 
irrespective of origin. 
  [Bishop] But European values, should we keep them in the new 
South Africa under a PAC government. 
  [Makwetu] Well, PAC has committed itself already to 
borrowing 
whatever is good from each bloc, that is the Eastern bloc and 
the Western bloc. 
  [Bishop] Right, let's move on into the manifesto. Violence 
-- you say the PAC has never been party to the wanton violence 
and carnage in our townships and rural areas. That's set down 
in the manifesto. 
  [Makwetu] Yes, that is the position. 
  [Bishop] Let's take that position as being absolutely true. 
The attacks attributed to APLA [Azanian People's Liberation 
Army], carried out by APLA, on civilians in King William's Town, 
Queenstown, the Cape Town church, Heidelberg Tavern, and the 
late Amy Biehl. What do you say about those attacks? 
  [Makwetu] Actually, we have suspended the arms struggle. I 
don't know whether you want us to reopen that now. 
  [Bishop] No, but what I have to feel free to do is to ask 
you 
questions that I think are in the minds of the people outside. 
  [Makwetu] Exactly, that is why I respond in this fashion. We 
thought by us suspending the arms struggle, we were trying to 
open up negotiations so that everybody should participate, 
including PAC, and as far as those instances you have just 
mentioned, that is not the violence that we are talking about. 
PAC or APLA, the armed wing of PAC, was engaged in armed 
struggle which has been suspended now. 
  [Bishop] That's in the past. 
  [Makwetu] Yes. 
  [Bishop] All right, move on to land -- no protection of 
freehold title to land. Is that the general policy of the PAC? 
  [Makwetu] If you mean by freehold title -- you mean the 
monopoly of land by whites in this country, therefore, PAC is 
opposed to that setup. 
  [Bishop] Not the monopoly, but the idea of you and I having 
a 
freehold over a house. Is that all right? 
  [Makwetu] I don't have that freehold. 
  [Bishop] No, but if you did. Would that be all right? 
  [Makwetu] There would be no need for me to have that 
freehold 
according to PAC policy. 
  [Bishop] But isn't that sort of, absolute security for 
people 
who have bought a house? 
  [Makwetu] We guarantee security to each and every individual 
in the country. That is PAC policy. 
  [Bishop] But if you don't have freehold, you don't have 
title 
to your land, do you, or your house? 
  [Makwetu] Why must you have freehold? Can't you have 
something else instead? 
  [Bishop] What would that be, that something else? 
  [Makwetu] Like leasehold rights. 
  [Bishop] Well, you can have leasehold. Some people do have 
leasehold rights, but I am just asking then -- so the policy is 
no freehold in the new PAC Azania? 
  [Makwetu] Well, our position has been put loud and clear, 
that we won't be selling and buying land. 
  [Bishop] And you won't allow people to do that individually? 
  [Makwetu] Why should we do that? 
  [Bishop] Well, I don't know why you should. I'm just asking 
whether you will. 
  [Makwetu] No we won't. 
  [Bishop] So all private land transactions will be canceled 
under a PAC government? 
  [Makwetu] We are saying that the land has been robbed from 
our forefathers. It has been stolen and taken away by force and 
this is the land we say should be returned to its rightful 
owners, the African people. 
  [Bishop] When was that land stolen? 
  [Makwetu] As early as 1652. 
  [Bishop] Mr. Makwetu, couldn't it be argued that that land 
has become the land of the people whom you say stole it, over a 
period of history? I mean, isn't it an impossibility to wind 
back history this way? 
  [Makwetu] This land was -- there were no dealings between 
our forefathers and those who stole the land from them. 
  [Bishop] But that applies all over the world, doesn't it? I 
mean the Anglos and Saxons, when they landed in England.... 
  [Makwetu, interrupting] Well it is.... 
  [Bishop, continuing] ... took by conquest from the Celts. 
  [Makwetu] That's right. 
  [Bishop] So, I mean this is how history, fortunately, or 
unfortunately progresses, isn't it? 
  [Makwetu] Well, as far as we are concerned that is no 
progress at all. If you deny other people land, you can't call 
that progress. 
  [Bishop] OK. Then, the PAC government would take back land? 
  [Makwetu] Yes. 
  [Bishop] And give compensation? 
  [Makwetu] We will compensate you for improvements that you 
have made on that piece of land. 
  [Bishop] But not for the cost of the land itself? 
  [Makwetu] Because we never sold the land to you. Why must we 
buy it back now? 
  [Bishop] But you weren't -- I mean it could be argued that 
you were not in possession, or there, to be bargained with! Not 
previously, not in history, not so when the.... 
  [Makwetu, interrupting] That is an.... 
  [Bishop, continuing] ...not so when the Afrikaner farmer 
bought this land, or took it over 250 years ago. I mean, you 
know, your party wasn't there, as it were. 
  [Makwetu] Most of them never even bought that land, for that 
matter. They were given that piece of land. 
  [Bishop] But in real terms, practical terms, wouldn't you 
see 
this kind of policy as a recipe for -- if not civil war -- mass 
exodus? The people will fight to hold on to their land, won't 
they, and really fight? 
  [Makwetu] We are fighting right now to regain that land, and 
the sky has not fallen. 
  [Bishop] I know, but I mean if you were in power, as a PAC 
government, and you instituted a policy like this? 
  [Makwetu] There is a regime that is in power now, that has 
instituted a policy which has impoverished us. 
  [Bishop] Well, the regime says it's given away, you know, 
given up the apartheid land laws, made it possible for 
everybody, black and white, to buy land and live wherever they 
like. I mean they, they've changed it. 
  [Makwetu] How are we expected to buy the land when we have 
no 
resources whatsoever, denied deliberately those resources? 
  [Bishop] Well, it's true, but then people, white people at 
one stage had no resources and had to find them somewhere. I 
mean with jobs and with progression and so on. 
  [Makwetu] Exactly, that is what we contemplate too. We must 
create jobs for everybody to live. 
  [Bishop] Well, the economy is quite a large piece of your 
manifesto, Mr. Makwetu. Redistribution of wealth figures 
prominently there. Just outline how that would take place under 
a PAC government? 
  [Makwetu] At present we note that the whole economy of the 
country is in the hands of a tiny minority. PAC is opposed to 
this. We feel that the African people should have a stake in the 
economy which has been denied to them for centuries. We say, 
therefore, that the industries that are operating in the country 
should allow workers working in those industries to enjoy the 
fruit of their labor. In other words, workers should not be 
shear wage earners, but they should have a share even in the 
profits. Not only that, but they should have a say in decision 
making, and in order for them to be able to do so, they should 
be furnished with information pertaining to those industries. 
  [Bishop] That's not too far from Mrs. Thatcher's caring 
capitalist. 
  [Makwetu] That's why we talk of a caring economy here. 
  [Bishop] Yes. Did you get the word from Mrs. Thatcher then? 
[laughs] 
  [Makwetu] No, not Mrs. Thatcher. In fact, I never even knew 
that she ever uttered such a word. 
  [Bishop] She did. She called it caring capitalism. It was 
also about shares, share capital being given to workers and so 
on. All right. Where does this much vaunted and flaunted market 
economy come in and are you for that? The market, you know, the 
market? 
  [Makwetu] Well, we still have to be educated about the 
market 
forces, because we normally don't even see them. For instance, 
when you talk of the selling of land you say market forces are 
going to decide, only to find that there is hardly anybody who 
is prepared to sell the land. So we have a problem with that 
term, not unless it is defined properly. 
  [Bishop] And nationalization, you say no nationalization? 
  [Makwetu] Yes. 
  [Bishop] But socialization and democratization. 
  [Makwetu] Exactly. 
  [Bishop] Now, what will they mean, those two things? 
  [Makwetu] It's exactly what I said already. 
  [Bishop] Oh, that one. 
  [Makwetu] Democracy is the participation of everybody. 
Similarly with socialization. 
  [Bishop] Looking at it, say, from the grassroots then, will 
people with small shops, businesses, be affected by your 
economic policies. Will they be restricted? 
  [Makwetu] No. In fact we will encourage more people to open 
up businesses. 
  [Bishop] And keep the profits of their labor? 
  [Makwetu] Well, I have already indicated that they should 
share the profits with the workers, because whoever is going to 
start a business definitely will need somebody to assist in 
their business. 
  [Bishop] Yes, but I mean, you know, will there be 
profit-keeping? 
  [Makwetu] Of course, we have no problem with that. 
  [Bishop] And now the big companies, you know, the Big 20, as 
they are called. 
  [Makwetu] Similarly the big companies, that's where quite a 
big chunk of labor is involved. These are the people who must 
be catered for. 
  [Bishop] If somebody said to you there is a large element of 
command economy, collectivisation, control from the center in 
your plan. Would you agree with that? 
  [Makwetu] What is the quarrel with that? Let us suppose 
there is. 
  [Bishop] No, I'm not saying there is a quarrel. I'm just 
saying -- would you agree that that would be a fair estimation 
of what you might be up to as a new government? 
  [Makwetu] I'm not quite so sure that that is the correct 
assessment. 
  [Bishop] Let's move on, and we'll talk about workers. You 
should put a big emphasis on the workers. Your party, I think, 
has always said it's a workers' party. Collective bargaining -- 
you go for that? 
  [Makwetu] Yes. 
  [Bishop] Some of the latest, and I think THE ECONOMIST 
carries it -- whether you, you know, like that magazine or not, 
carries a view that collective bargaining as applied in Germany, 
for instance, has been a rather large failure, that, in fact, 
instead of workers' wages being raised it has had the opposite 
effect, that collective bargaining seems to not be working. 
What would you say to that? 
  [Makwetu] It doesn't mean that if something failed in 
Germany 
it's going to fail here. 
  [Bishop] No. 
  [Makwetu] Similarly, capitalism has thrived in other 
countries, but we have problems here at home. 
  [Bishop] The reason I particularly mention Germany is 
because, under housing, you mention the German system soon after 
the war and you think that might be applicable or at least worth 
looking at as far as your system concerning housing might be. 
  [Makwetu] Yes. Well, it was just an example. 
  [Bishop] Yes, but you also stress it a little bit more, I 
think. The example goes on to say that after the war, in 
Germany, tax--wealth tax--was applied and you imply, in that 
sentence anyway, that it might be a good thing to do that here. 
Is that so -- wealth tax on property? 
  [Makwetu] Yes, there will be tax. 
  [Bishop] How would that be levied? 
  [Makwetu] Well, that will be the task of economists and 
experts. I am not an expert. 
  [Bishop] Yes. It's been mooted that the tax in Germany was 
simply on very large organizations, large land owners, hotel 
owners, blocks of flats, people who owned that kind of property 
-- not the individual man and woman with one house. Do you 
think that's how that might go here? 
  [Makwetu] Well, I would not say so and so would be 
advantaged 
but we have made it clear that on issues like food, etc., we 
will see to it that there is no tax levied. 
  [Bishop] Affirmative action, you say is not about lowering 
standards or introducing reverse racism by the back door. You 
don't see it then, but I would challenge you, you know, Mr. 
Makwetu.... 
  [Makwetu, interrupting] Let's hear your challenge. 
  [Bishop] All right, isn't affirmative action, really, it 
is--I mean, let's have it out on the table--it's discriminatory. 
It favors one race, sex, or age group, over another. Doesn't 
it? 
  [Makwetu] That is not true. 
  [Bishop] But if I was going to be affirmatively actioned 
because I'm a white, aging, or middle-class male -- we hear a 
lot about that incidentally -- then I am being discriminated 
against because I am not a black, young, virile male. 
  [Makwetu] How are you discriminated against, since you have 
been benefiting all along? 
  [Bishop] No, I'm not...I'm not.... I'm just making an 
example 
of myself. What I'm saying is -- if you start saying: men out, 
women in, or white people out and black people in, it's 
discriminatory, isn't it? 
  [Makwetu] No, that is not affirmative action. We are saying 
that doors should be opened to those who have not benefited all 
along, long ago, through discrimination. That is what we are 
saying. We are saying people should be trained to fit in into 
certain positions which have been denied to them all along. 
  [Bishop] How will you do that? 
  [Makwetu] We will do that by developing skills. Instead of 
importing skills, we will see to it that human resources inside 
the country are developed. 
  [Bishop] Training schemes? 
  [Makwetu] Exactly. 
  [Bishop] No instant changeover then, you know, of people? 
  [Makwetu] No, these things are not going to happen 
overnight, 
really. 
  [Bishop] How long would you say it would take with a PAC 
government to bring about the changes you would like to see? 
  [Makwetu] That is not an easy question to answer. I may say, 
for instance, seven years or eight years, but the problem is, 
there are people who are suffering at the moment. Are they 
going to be patient waiting for me for that seven years or eight 
years? So it's not easy for me. This is a debate amongst the 
factor...[pauses] people who are involved. 
  [Bishop] I don't see, and you will know that I would spot 
it, 
anything about freedom of expression or the media in your 
manifesto. Did you leave it out by accident or deliberately? 
It's not in here. 
  [Makwetu] No, I don't think there was a need for it really 
in 
the manifesto, because that will be covered under a Bill of 
Rights. 
  [Bishop] Well, let me ask you as leader of the party: What 
is 
your approach to freedom of expression? 
  [Makwetu] Of course, we encourage freedom of expression, 
freedom of association, freedom of movement, etc. 
  [Bishop] Freedom of opinion, even if you don't like it? 
  [Makwetu] Exactly, exactly. 
  [Bishop] Hard questioning of evasive politicians. Is that 
it? 
  [Makwetu] We have no problem with that. In fact, we 
subscribe to Voltaire's position--that's the French philosopher 
who was prepared to die protecting your right to put your point 
of view. 
  [Bishop] Under housing I spotted something that I thought 
might be a real vote catcher. You promised the township people 
that if they paid sufficient rent to cover the structure of 
their house, then it's theirs. 
  [Makwetu] Yes, exactly, that is our position. 
  [Bishop] But, says a fortunate township dweller who is now 
in 
this position, that Mr. Makwetu doesn't want freehold, so I'll 
never really own the house. I'll just hold it as a curator for 
the state. So, what would you say to him? 
  [Makwetu] Not for the state. You'll be a curator for your 
next of kin. For instance, if you die it will be handed over to 
you. 
  [Bishop] Oh, it can go to your next of kin. 
  [Makwetu] Yes, exactly. 
  [Bishop] So it would be an inheritable... 
  [Makwetu] Exactly. 
  [Bishop] We've got about 30 seconds. I could go on all 
night, but we just have another item, I'm afraid, Mr. Makwetu. 
Tribal leaders, traditional leaders -- PAC's views on those, 
because they hold a lot of land in their power as it were. 
  [Makwetu] They hold no land in our country, really. 
  [Bishop] Don't they really? 
  [Makwetu] Absolutely next to nothing. You must bear in mind 
that 87 percent of the land is in the hands of the white 
community, and even the 13 percent is with them, a part of it is 
not in their hands. 
  [Bishop] And in the last few seconds, health -- universal 
health -- you are bringing forward.... 
  [Makwetu] Yes. 
  [Bishop] Any private health? Would you allow private 
practitioners, private hospitals? 
  [Makwetu] Well, that is a hot debate in PAC circles, but the 
majority feels that we must have public health. 
  [Bishop] And education -- no private education? 
  [Makwetu] On education we feel that education should be made 
free up to a certain standard, that is standard 10, or 18 years 
of age. 
  [Bishop] No private education? 
  [Makwetu] We are opposed to private education. 
  [Bishop] What a pity, Mr. Makwetu. We've run out, I think. 
  [Makwetu] There's nothing we can do. 
  [Bishop] No, thank you so much anyway. 
  [Makwetu] Thank you.

  [Text] A coleader of the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner 
National Front], General Constand Viljoen, says the Afrikaners 
and the Zulus have built up a military capability second only to 
that of the South African Defense Force. 
  General Viljoen was speaking at a Volksfront meeting in 
Lydenburg in the eastern Transvaal. He said this capability, 
with the political power of the Afrikaner, had led to the 
Afrikaner becoming a factor that could not be ignored by even 
the president of the ANC [African National Congress], Mr. Nelson 
Mandela. According to General Viljoen the Afrikaner was 
enjoying increasing foreign support, which was putting pressure 
on the government and the ANC to accommodate the Afrikaner in a 
future constitutional dispensation. General Viljoen also said 
that certain intelligence services were attempting to cause 
division in right-wing Afrikaner ranks. He said right-wing 
organizations were vulnerable to infiltration and that it was a 
technique of intelligence services to infiltrate and sow 
division. After the gathering he told our political news staff 
that it was possible that the government's intelligence service 
was involved. 
  General Viljoen would not give examples of the alleged 
infiltration but said that certain things were happening which 
had caused him to draw this conclusion.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash: "Middle East Office Launched"] </F>
  [Text] South Africa, back in the Middle East after a 
boycott lasting decades, has set up its first international arms 
office in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to break into the 
lucrative market in the region. 
  Office director Peter Greeling said the weapons giant 
Armscor 
[Armaments Corporation of South Africa] opened the office in Abu 
Dhabi last year and it covered the six-nation Gulf Co-operation 
Council (GCC) and other countries in the Middle East. 
  "It is South Africa's first arms office in the world," Mr. 
Greeling said. "It will co-ordinate arms sales to the region 
and identify opportunities for military co-operation." 
  The project coincides with plans by GCC states to bolster 
their armies following the Gulf War. Military experts said the 
six members were expected to spend more than five billion 
dollars annually on defence up to the year 2,000. 
  The United States, France and Britain will probably be the 
main beneficiaries of such plans, as they already dominate the 
Middle East arms market. However, South Africa participated in 
a ground arms show in Abu Dhabi early in 1993 and sent 
representatives of more than 30 companies to an international 
air show in Dubai late 1993 to exhibit helicopters and other air 
defence systems. The main feature in its pavilion was the CSH-2 
Rooivalk attack helicopter. 
  South African officials said that they were negotiating with 
some Gulf countries to sell the Rooivalk, one of the most 
advanced helicopters in the world. "We are optimistic about 
deals," Greeling said. "We are not competitive in some types of 
weapons because ours are expensive. But we are competitive in 
artillery, which is the best in the world. We also have the 
Rooivalk." 
  The GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait 
and the UAE -- lifted the boycott against South Africa two years 
ago after sweeping reforms by President F.W. de Klerk to 
dismantle "apartheid."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Suggestions To Woo Rightists Into Election -- Johannesburg 
THE STAR in English on 24 February in a page-22 editorial 
proposes "two changes in approach" to get the Freedom Alliance 
(FA) to participate in the election: "First: asymmetry. Allow 
a fractious province (kwaZulu/Natal) to exercise more power than 
other provinces might wish to. Second: abolish the override. 
The battle about where central power can override a province is 
not worth the trouble. If the elected government of a province 
fails to meet basic norms, leave the judgment to its voters. 
Considerable efforts have been made to satisfy the FA. History 
says: keep trying." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  `Little Chance' of Election Postponement -- "Political 
opposition to the election is bound to be fanatical and violent, 
even if there is unexpected progress in the last-minute efforts 
to achieve an inclusive settlement," points out a page-14 
editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 
February. "But if the pro-election campaigns can capture the 
public imagination, there must be a good chance that the 
spoilers will be overwhelmed by the numbers of those who want to 
choose South Africa's first representative government." The 
Business Election Fund was launched this week, as well as the 
publicity campaign explaining the role of the Independent 
Electoral Commission, setting the country "firmly on course for 
the historic poll in April. There now seems little chance that 
it will be postponed, whatever the threats of disruption." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Homeland Amendment 'Vague and Impractical' -- "With the 
inclusion of a `self-determination' clause in the amended 
interim constitution, South Africa is sailing into dangerous 
waters," warns a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 24 February. "The problem is the ANC [African 
National Congress] and the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] cannot 
exactly spell out what they mean by self-determination. The 
Right wildly lay claim to the OFS [Orange Free State], Transvaal 
and Northern Natal as sovereign volkstaats [homelands] while 
some negotiations vaguely speak about Afrikaner cantons. The 
ANC gives the impression it is an issue it hopes will fizzle out 
after the election. The criticism levelled by the PAC's 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] Barney Desai at the World Trade Centre 
this week is valid: The volkstaat amendment is a vague and 
impractical promise unlikely to be fulfilled. It also leaves 
the door ajar for other groups to make similar claims to self- 
determination and territory and the Balkanisation of South 
Africa." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  Keys's Growing Economic Optimism -- Cape Town CAPE TIMES in 
English on 21 February in a page-4 editorial says Finance 
Minister Derek Keys's "growing optimism about the economy" is 
encouraging news for the labor and business community, and it 
"might be unduly cynical to suggest that such pronouncements 
should be regarded in an election context." Only "two days ago" 
economists expected the economy to grow by about 2-2.5 percent. 
Now Keys thinks the 1994 growth figure will be 3-4 percent. 
"It would be easy to dismiss such a shift as short term 
expediency by a politician with creative accounting abilities, 
but with Mr Keys this is unlikely. For starters, it is quite 
possible that he will still be presiding over the economy during 
the reign of the government of national unity. Far from 
enhancing his reputation and that of the National Party, Mr Keys 
stands every chance of becoming a scapegoat if buoyant growth 
fails to materialise." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Standerton Community Provokes Black Majority -- A page-8 
editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 18 February 
argues: "The blame for the events at Standerton in which 30 
people were injured must first and foremost be placed on the 
shoulders of the right wing which decided unilaterally that the 
town must be incorporated into the so-called homeland. The ANC 
supporters who wanted to deliver a memorandum to the town hall 
in protest against such plans were fully entitled to express 
their dissatisfaction, provided that it was done in an orderly 
manner. It is a pity that blacks in the town were forbidden 
from doing so by the local magistrate declaring their march 
unlawful. A small portion of the community cannot provoke the 
overwhelming majority in this way and then expect no one to 
protest." "What happened at Standerton must serve as a warning 
to those who believe they can simply force unworkable plans on 
others." 

<H6>    BEELD </H6>
  ANC Nurtures Communist Links -- Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans on 21 February says in a page-6 editorial: "In his 
first speech after his release, Mr. Nelson Mandela made a 
gesture towards his communist allies from the past. One had 
expected it. The `liberation front' had to pay its dues to 
countries and leaders who had themselves not set an example for 
freedom. However, one would not expect the ANC to still nurture 
these ties a few years down the line. The whole world has 
changed since then, with communism having collapsed, and with it 
the tyrannical authoritarianism which formed such a large part 
of the 20th century. But the ANC remains in alliance with the 
South African Communist Party," says BEELD, and "further 
evidence of how it holds alive the past are its ties with Cuba 
and Libya, countries which the United States views as terrorist 
states. In a draft document, the ANC's department of 
international affairs again stands up for Cuba, asking that the 
new government establish ties with Cuba and that the United 
States lift its economic sanctions against Cuba." "With such an 
approach the ANC will not attract international assistance to 
South Africa to create prosperity. At some time or another the 
ANC will have to choose between its friends and the interests of 
the people of South Africa." 
  Violence Must be Stopped -- A second editorial on page-6 of 
BEELD says: "In South Africa there is the reality are 
politicial leaders who at gatherings plead the cause of 
tolerance and free political participation. There is, however, 
a second reality of intimidation and violence on the ground 
which is raging on unhindered and claiming more and more 
victims. Only last week the ANC complained that the death of a 
Nelspruit National Party organizer should be investigated in the 
ANC. At Creighton in Natal 15 ANC supporters died in a 
bloodbath. Civilized behavior has clearly become the first 
victim of the relentless power struggle being waged in the 
country. Political parties must know, though, that what is 
being sown by their followers today will be reaped by all in the 
months and years ahead."

  [Text] Pretoria Feb 24 SAPA -- South African agricultural 
products should have greater access to the most important 
foreign markets because of the provisions of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Minister of Agriculture 
Kraai van Niekerk said on Thursday [24 February]. There would 
also be a general shake-up in local agriculture as export 
subsidies and domestic support were reduced. 
  Addressing the Agricultural Outlook Conference in Pretoria, 
Dr van Niekerk said the conclusion of the Uruguay Round should 
lead to an increase in world prices of agricultural products. 
"This will strengthen the comparative advantage of South 
African products on the world and domestic markets." 
  Dr van Niekerk said the country would gain many advantages 
from its recent admission to the UN's food and agricultural 
organisation and other bodies. 
  Onderstepoort was to become a cooperation centre for Africa, 
and South Africa would host the World Veterinary Association 
congress later this year. 
  He said the cabinet had in principle endorsed the guidelines 
contained in the report of the Agricultural Marketing Policy 
Evaluation Committee which recommended one agricultural 
marketing policy to serve the commercial and developing sectors 
and provide market access for both. Dr van Niekerk said 
continued single-channel marketing schemes and marketing boards 
for commodities could not be ruled out. But all marketing 
systems would have to be transparent, supported by all those 
involved and applied without political interference.

  [Text] Monrovia, 23 Feb (AFP) -- Today, the Liberian 
interim government, the Interim National Government of National 
Unity [IGNU] accused the main armed faction, the National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], of "kidnapping" on 20 
February a top official of the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL], 
the armed wing of IGNU, at the Firestone rubber plantation 
located some 50 km from Monrovia. 
  Colonel Saykagepo Kortor, deputy chief of the AFL 
intelligence service, was arrested along with his three 
bodyguards and driver, who was released, the interim government 
defense minister disclosed. According to the driver, the four 
soldiers were arrested after going through the last checkpoint 
manned by the African peacekeeping force in Liberia, Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group 
[ECOMOG], in the Firestone plantation, which marks the entrance 
into an NPFL-controlled zone. 
  This arrest occurs at a time when the disarmament of the 
Liberian armed factions is scheduled to start in less than two 
weeks, in accordance with a new agreement signed last week in 
Monrovia between the main factions in the Liberian conflict -- 
the interim government, the NPFL, and the United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO]. IGNU has called on 
ECOMOG and the UN military observers "to ensure the safety and 
release of the AFL soldiers." For its part, ULIMO has issued an 
ultimatum to NPFL to release Col. Kortor and his men "within 48 
hours" or face "reprisals."

  [Excerpt] A rebel group attacked Arlit early this morning, 
precisely at 0420. The attackers, whose number could not be 
determined, killed two soldiers and took six four-wheel drive 
vehicles belonging to the Akokan Mining Company. During the hot 
pursuit launched shortly after the attack, the defense and 
security forces recovered two vehicles. We got this report a 
while ago from our permanent correspondent in Agadez, Mousselai 
Nazadane. 
  This is the first rebel attack since the last technical 
meeting held in Ouagadougou. Following that meeting, the 
coordination of the four Tuareg rebel movements published its 
political agenda in the form of a document entitled, "Outline of 
the Resistance Program." In a nutshell, the rebels are claiming 
their right to autonomous administration of the territory they 
claim a right to, and guarantees that their community will be 
represented in the government, the National Assembly, and the 
Armed Forces. These are the fundamental demands of the rebels 
as published by the NIGER NEWS AGENCY. [passage omitted]

  [Text] More than 30 Nigerian villages in border areas have 
been burned down by the Cameroonian gendarmes between December 
last year and this month. The commander, 13th Motorized Brigade 
of the Nigerian Army, Brigadier General Wutomi Guirayi, made 
this known in Calabar while addressing newsmen on the situation 
in the Bakassi Peninsula. He said that property estimated at 
millions of naira belonging to Nigerian fishermen and traders 
were also destroyed by the gendarmes. The commander also said 
that many Nigerians were either killed or maimed while their 
fishing nets and boats were seized by the Cameroonians. He 
stated that Nigeria did not retaliate. The commander advised 
journalists wishing to carry out on-the-spot reports to obtain 
clearance from the military before traveling to the Bakassi 
Peninsula.

  [Text] Lagos, 23 Feb. (PANA) -- Nigeria and Ghana have 
expressed concern over the delay in the implementation of the 
Liberian peace accord, signed in Cotonou, Benin Republic in July 
last year, a Nigerian Government statement said Wednesday [23 
February]. The statement was issued in Nigeria's federal 
capital, Abuja, after a Ghanaian envoy, Lt.-Gen. Arnold Quainoo, 
had delivered a message from President Jerry Rawlings, to 
Nigerian leader, Gen. Sani Abacha, on the Liberian crisis and 
other issues. 
  Nigeria and Ghana have troops in the West African peace 
keeping force in Liberia (ECOMOG) [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], which has now been 
expanded and includes battalions from Tanzania and Uganda. 
  Two weeks ago, Ghana served notice of its intention to 
"review" its participation in ECOMOG unless the warring factions 
showed commitment to peace within one month. Nigeria has the 
largest contingent of about 12,000 troops in Liberia and there 
is growing public impatience among Nigerians at the lack of 
progress in the efforts to end the four-year-old war. 
  The statement said that Gen. Quainoo briefed the Nigerian 
leader on the recent tour of Liberia by a Ghanaian military 
delegation and "restated the country's (Ghana's) concern at the 
non-implementation of the Cotonou peace accord". 
  It quoted Gen. Abacha as saying that Nigeria shared Ghana's 
concern at the delay in resolving the Liberian crisis. He 
expressed his belief that "Liberians must be willing to 
cooperate among themselves for amicable resolution of the crisis 
in the war-torn country". 
  Nigeria and Ghana also expressed the need for improved trade 
cooperation between them as a catalyst for sub-regional economic 
integration, the statement added.

  [Text] Lome, 24 Feb (AFP) -- Togolese voters faced a 
further tantalising wait late Wednesday [23 February] for 
results from a historic poll, after the National Electoral 
Commission refused to publish the full count. Four days after 
the second round in the country's first multi-party elections, 
voters are still waiting to see which party is to form the new 
government. 
  President Gnassingbe Eyadema has ruled Togo since 1967. 
  In a statement to journalists Commission President Garba 
Sipohon acknowledged that all the votes had been counted after 
Sunday's poll. "The results will be sent to the Supreme Court 
for evaluation," he said. But Sipohon disclosed the outcome in 
only 19 of the 24 contested districts, which when added to the 
winners of the first round give opposition parties a one-seat 
lead over the former sole ruling pro-Eyadema Togolese People's 
Rally (RPT). Sipohon said the opposition had won 38 seats 
compared to 37 for the RPT. Transitional Premier Joseph 
Koffigoh who stood as an independent also won a spot in the 
81-seat assembly. 
  Both the opposition and the RPT have claimed victory in the 
poll. Sipohon said announcement of the counts in five districts 
had been held back because of the "circumstances" in which 
voting had taken place. Violence marred the poll Sunday when 
polling stations in two districts were forced to close and the 
count was later disturbed in three others. 
  The court has 72 hours to issue an official declaration on 
the results, with challenges having to be presented within the 
subsequent five days. The court will then have a further 10 
days to rule on the challenges. 
  The opposition parties, made up of Action Committee for 
Renewal (CAR) and the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), have 
already claimed victory in the five disputed districts -- which 
would give them an overall majority in the parliament. But on 
Tuesday the RPT accused the opposition of "fraud," alleging it 
had been responsible for the violence. 
  In a statement late Wednesday it claimed victory saying the 
Supreme Court would "confirm its success." "The moment has come 
to form the country's government," the RPT added, declaring 
itself "ready to play its due part" and collaborate in a "large 
national unity government." The commission is made up of four 
pro-presidential sympathisers and four opposition supporters. 
  The four opposition commission members complained Wednesday 
that their colleagues and "outside personalities at a high-level 
in the state" had pressured them into not publishing the full 
results. They said they had threatened to resign if the results 
were not published in their totality. 
  Under the terms of the Constitution Eyadema must name a 
prime 
minister from the ranks of the new majority parties.

  [Text] Lome, 24 Feb (ATOP/PANA)--The National Electoral 
Commission [CEN] late last night published the results of the 
legislative elections in 19 out of the 24 constituencies 
concerned in the second round of the elections that took place 
on 20 February. According to these results, the opposition 
officially won 38 seats as against 37 for President Eyadema's 
supporters and one for Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh. 
  According to CEN Chairman Sipohon Gaba, it is now up to the 
Supreme Court to deliberate on the case of five constituencies 
where incidents disrupted the votes. It should be recalled that 
the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT], the former single ruling 
party led by President Eyadema, accused the opposition of being 
at the origin of the incidents that marred the votes in several 
polling stations and of "organizing fraud to such an extent that 
it was impossible to validate the results of the contested 
constituencies." 
  The opposition has rejected all the accusations leveled 
against it and affirmed that "the RPT should accept defeat 
instead of confusing people." One of the opposition activists 
who is also member of the CEN, Mr. Ali Diabate, affirmed that 
the opposition had definitely won in the five constituencies 
contested by the RPT. He warned that "if the government does 
not proclaim the full results, the four opposition members 
belonging to the CEN will resign." 
  The Supreme Court, to which all the results and various 
reports were submitted on 23 February, has about 10 days to 
deliberate on all the contested cases before proclaiming the 
final results. For their part, foreign observers believe that 
despite the regrettable incidents that took place on 20 
February, "the second round of the legislative elections took 
place in satisfactory conditions."

Youth Wing of the Rally of the Togolese People [JRPT] in their 
21 and 22 February declaration, the Action Committee for Renewal 
[CAR] has just sent us a declaration in which it says it is 
surprised that the RPT and the JRPT have accused it of having 
committed massive frauds during the recent legislative 
elections. In its statement, the CAR asserts that in fact, some 
faults were committed and that it is the present government 
entirely committed to the RPT which has organized the elections, 
provided security, and ensured the appointment and management of 
personnel and the equipment. Once again, the CAR reaffirms its 
unchanging desire for nonviolence and immediately encourages all 
the political parties to respect the verdict of the ballot box.

  [Text] Following the second round of the legislative 
elections, public order is being disturbed in various 
prefectures, as well Lome district, by some irresponsible 
citizens who are perpetrating acts of violence and vandalism 
here and there thus threatening the security of people and 
property. 
  The government hereby condemns these blind and undemocratic 
acts of violence and launches an urgent appeal to all opposition 
party leaders and all citizens to help create an atmosphere of 
tolerance that would guarantee freedom of speech for all, and 
thus prevent our dear motherland from becoming a closed field of 
sterile political struggle at a time when all states in the 
subregion are preoccupied by the economic problems caused by the 
devaluation of the CFA franc. 
  Our country Togo gives the impression of prioritizing the 
political debate to the detriment of the daily difficulties 
facing the majority of our people. The government, in its 
concern to protect our common interest, will take all necessary 
measures to maintain public order and to assure the security of 
people and property throughout the national territory. Firm 
instructions have been given to the security forces to prevent 
all disturbances and to deal with all troublemakers in our 
cities and villages. They will be sought after and brought to 
court.

  [Text] Libreville, 24 Feb (AFP) -- Shooting broke out in 
working-class districts of the Gabonese capital on Thursday [24 
February] as the government accused the opposition of arming its 
activists during a bloody general strike. The violence, which 
erupted alongside a trade union protest at the cost of living, 
has claimed at least six lives with the gunning down late 
Wednesday of the latest known victim, a corporal in the 
parachute regiment, the security forces stated. 
  Speaking for the government, the daily L'UNION newspaper 
charged that the main opposition party led by Paul Mba Abessole 
had hijacked the strike for its own ends and was handing out 
hunting rifles, other guns and machetes. 
  Small groups of armed opposition militants continued to man 
barricades in outlying districts of Libreville, which were 
cordoned off by police and troops, sources close to the security 
forces said. The city centre and the seafront, patrolled by 
President Omar Bongo's crack guard troops, remained calm, 
however, and no trouble was reported from Gabon's traditionally 
volatile second city, Port Gentil. 
  The whereabouts of Abessole, a Roman Catholic priest and 
leader of the National Lumberjacks' Rally (RNB) party, were not 
clear on Thursday, opposition activists said. Security forces 
had Wednesday stormed his house on the outskirts of the capital 
after giving chase to opposition activists who had opened fire 
on them, government television reported. But an opposition 
spokesman told AFP that the RNB leader had not been at home when 
the raid took place. 
  Thursday's press attack on Abessole, whom L'UNION accused of 
being "chief of a warmongering band," was the first direct 
criticism of the opposition leader by the government paper since 
he claimed to have defeated Bongo in presidential elections in 
December. 
  Tension was reported from Oyem, the chief town of the RNB's 
stronghold in the northern Woleu-Ntem Province, where opposition 
supporters had moved the local transmitter of their 
Radio-Liberte. Early Tuesday, security forces destroyed 
Radio-Liberte's equipment in Libreville itself, sparking 
violence in which an official of Bongo's Democratic Party was 
burned to death in his home. 
  A dozen public and private sector trade unions launched the 
strike Monday to push for higher wages following last month's 50 
percent devaluation of the CFA franc, the common currency among 
14 African countries pegged to the French franc. "But we are a 
long way now from devaluation or politics," one analyst said 
Wednesday. The "law of the jungle" had taken over in the poorer 
districts of Libreville, he added.

to mitigate the negative effects of the devaluation and the 
strikes paralyzing the nation's economic activities. Following 
this exceptional meeting, the Gabonese Confederation of Free 
Trade Unions [CGSL] has decided to suspend its general strike. 
CGSL Secretary General Francis Mayombo talks to Jean de Dieu 
Odong Ovono. 
  [Begin Mayombo recording] After the explanations given by 
various parties, the head of state ordered negotiations to 
commence swiftly. Thus negotiations will begin this afternoon 
at the Ministry of Planning with a view to reviewing prices. 
Next week, precisely on 1 March, we shall examine, together 
with the same committee, the parity of wage increases. 
  We are, therefore, suspending our strike in order to 
negotiate with the government and to analyze the eventual 
increases whose percentages we do not know yet. We shall first 
have to negotiate with the government and show evidence of 
skyrocketing prices. This will enable us to trigger off a 
system of negotiations on the basis of the loss of purchasing 
power and the housewife's expenditure. It is only then -- at 
the 1 March meeting -- that we shall be clear about the parity 
of the increases that will be made. [end recording]

  [Text] After demonstrations that led to a loss of lives and 
damage to property over the past few days, peace is slowly 
returning to the Rwandan capital, Kigali, and its suburbs. 
State employees have gone back to work. Pubilc and private 
transportation is functioning normally. Markets and shops are 
open. 
  The demonstrations, which had paralyzed all activities in 
Kigali, led to a loss of lives and damage to property. Hospital 
sources say that Kigali Hospital registered 15 dead and 43 
injured, 14 of whom are still hospitalized. Among the injured 
is a small girl aged six, who lost her arm. The toll forwarded 
by the Belgian Red Cross is much heavier: About 20 are reported 
to have died and the number of injured is estimated at 100. 
  According to the police (?brigade) operating in Kigali, 
peace 
has returned in almost all areas of the town. However, last 
night in Gikondo, a man and a woman were killed at (Gatenga). 
Families who fled their homes in the Gikondo area have not yet 
returned. This information was reported by our correspondent in 
Kigali, Jean-Pierre Nshimirumuremyi.

  [Excerpts] The transitional government and National 
Assembly, which were enlarged to include the Rwanda Patriotic 
Front [RPF], whose establishment was expected to have taken 
place yesterday, are yet to be set up. Once again, the head of 
state, Major General Juvenal Habyarimana, arrived at the 
National Development Council building, only to note the absence 
of the RPF, as well as the Social Democratic Party, and of the 
two prime ministers. 
  Those who attended the ceremony included the UN secretary 
general's special representative to Rwanda, Dr. Jacques-Roger 
Booh Booh, General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of the UN 
Assistance Mission to Rwanda, the diplomatic corps in Kigali, 
and other representatives. It was a return to 5 January, and 
the head of state can only regret this. Here is President 
Juvenal Habyarimana: 
  [Begin Habyarimana recording] Excellencies, Ladies and 
Gentlemen, may I ask you to stand and observe a minute of 
silence in memory of the late Felicien Gatabazi and Martin 
Bucyana [CDR chairman]. 
  I had invited you to this ceremony for the establishment of 
the two remaining transitional institutions, namely the 
Transitional National Assembly and the broad-based transitional 
government. I had thought the situation was ripe for conclusion 
following consultations and discussions which have been 
continuing since 5 January, as well as all the long meetings 
which have been held. But I note, just like you, that 
unfortunately we are still at the [word indistinct] of 5 
January. I cannot establish a broad-based transitional 
government when the prime minister who would lead it is absent. 
  Somebody wanted to joke -- he thought he was joking. He 
said: Honestly, it is a strange situation in Rwanda--to have two 
prime ministers for a government that no longer functions and 
another for a government that has not yet arrived. That is the 
situation, and it is lasting too long. I can only agree, and at 
the same time thank those who responded to the call. The 
ceremony was in fact scheduled to take place yesterday afternoon. 
  After the consultations I have just mentioned, and after the 
meeting I had with the prime minister-designate two days ago, it 
had appeared that the ceremony would take place yesterday 
afternoon. But with the death of the late Gatabazi, we had to 
postpone it until this morning at 1000. And at 0800, I was told 
that the prime minister had asked that the ceremony be postponed 
(?by) 14 hours, which I accepted. So that is the situation. 
[passage omitted] 
  For my part, I do not see, after all these consultations and 
discussions, what I can do. Those with better brains than ours 
can give us further suggestions. But I believe everyone has 
contributed their goodwill. 
  So, since the media are here, I take this opportunity also 
to 
launch an appeal to the Rwandan population not to lose hope, to 
remain committed to peace, which they have always sought and 
abided by, which was disrupted by unfortunate chance, but which 
the Rwandan people still yearn for. 
  Let all the events we have gone through, the disasters we 
have talked about, be a lesson for us to remain united, despite 
the various parties to which we belong, despite the various 
regions we are from, and despite our ethnic affiliations. We 
are all and we all remain Rwandans, all equal, with equal 
rights. [passage omitted] [end recording].

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the RPF; place and date not given] </F>
  [Text] The communique reads as follows: It is now seven 
months after a peace agreement was signed between the RPF 
[Rwanda Patriotic Front] and the Rwandan Government. The 
implementation of the peace agreement was to begin 37 days from 
4 August 1993. Also, it is almost two months since RPF leaders 
and a battalion of 600 RPF soldiers arrived in Kigali. That was 
on 28 December 1993, which was in line with the implementation 
of the peace agreements. 
  The broad-based transitional government was supposed to be 
set up on 29 December 1993. However, this was not possible up 
the present day due to a few people who want to maintain the 
dictatorship because of their personal interests and interests 
and benefits. Those people are none other than the MRND 
[Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] CDR 
[Coalition for the Defence of the Republic] clique, with 
President Habyarimana at the top. President Habyarimana created 
divisions within the PL [Liberal Party], after which he and his 
cohorts created another pretext that the broad-based 
transitional government should be set up after the parties that 
will comprise the transitional institutions have agreed to give 
amnesty to all people who have or may have comitted crimes in 
the past. By this, the clique intends to forget that amnesty is 
given by the people to whom the crimes were committed, and after 
the people who committed the crimes accept the crimes and 
confess to the people that were offended. 
  However, this was not the real issue that the MRND-CDR 
clique 
wanted to bring forward, but only a tactic they wanted to employ 
so as to maintain the same powers MRND had before the signing of 
the peace agreements. With much effort to frustrate the setting 
up of the broad-based transitional government, President 
Habyarimana's clique has resorted to creating divisions in 
political parties, terrorism and widespread massacres all over 
the country, especially in the capital, Kigali. 
  On the 20 February 1993, a group of MRND-CDR supporters who 
called themselves power started acts of terrorism in the 
capital, Kigali, with an intention to preempt a political rally 
that was organised by Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu, the prime 
minister-designate for the broad-based transitional government. 
The acts of hooliganism left car windscreens shattered, houses 
broken into and several people dead. 
  The following day, on 21 February, the same group of people 
put barricades around the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Constitutional Court, thus holding hostage employees in the two 
places for the whole day. 
  During the night of 21 February leading to 22, a date on 
which the broad-based transitional government was to be in 
place, the minister of works and energy, Mr. Felicien Gatabazi, 
who was also the secretary general of an opposition party, PSD, 
[Social Democratic Party] was shot dead. The death Mr. Gatabazi 
met could occur to any other political leader within the 
opposition parties, even the RPF. This is aimed at reducing the 
force that opposes the clique that wants to cling on to power. 
  The RPF informs all banyarwanda [Rwandan people] and the 
international community that it cannot accept and allow 
President Habyarimana and his clique to continue acts of terror 
and killing innocent banyarwanda. President Habyarimana does 
all this when the international community is looking on and 
instead of denouncing him decided to attribute all that is 
happening in our country to political parties in Rwanda. The 
RPF will not keep on watching. It has the ability and the right 
to take decisions at any time. The RPF is impressed to see 
banyarwanda coming together to fight for their rights. The RPF 
also requests an inquiry into the death of the minister of works 
and energy, Mr. Felicien Gatabazi, so that those responsible for 
his death are brought to court.

  [Excerpt] A curfew has been imposed in Cyimbogo commune, 
Cyangugu Prefecture, in southwestern Rwanda. Our colleague 
Nambaje tells us more: 
  [Nambaje] The decision was prompted by the low level of 
safety following the killing of Martin Bucyana, who came from 
Cyimbogo, when some people started looting and burning the homes 
of Tutsis. Over the past three days, a man and a woman were 
killed and more than 20 houses were burned down. Some people 
are homeless, and others have fled. Last night, 50 people, 
mainly children, slept at Cyangugu Parish. Currently there are 
70 people at the teachers' college in Mururu who fled their 
homes in fear. Today, Cyangugu Prefect Emmanuel Bagambiki met 
the inhabitants of (Tete) and (Mutongo) to consider ways of 
restoring peace in the two sectors, and throughout the entire 
Cyimbogo commune. In other sectors, such as (Muruhongo) and 
(Karenzo), the atmosphere is tense. [passage omitted].

<F P=106> [Interview with Mohamed Abdullatif, adviser to General </F>
Mohamed Farah Aidid, by Perry Kretz; place and date not given: 
"`Our People Are Tired of War'"] 
  [Text] [Kretz] What do you think about the German troop 
withdrawal? 
  [Abdullatif] We want all troops, irrespective of their 
nationality, to leave our country. This military intervention 
under the smokescreen of the UN operation has brought even more 
instability to our country after years of civil war. Everyone 
involved carries the same responsibility, including the Germans. 
  [Kretz] Will a new civil war erupt? 
  [Abdullatif] Our people are tired of war. We want to bring 
about stability and achieve peace without foreign assistance. 
  [Kretz] How should that happen? 
  [Abdullatif] We will work to disarm ourselves and create a 
new administration. Then, other countries could also help us. 
Disarmament should not involve violence. There should also be 
no more military conflicts between the two big clans, General 
Aidid's Habargidir and clan leader Ali Mahdi's Abgal. 
  [Kretz] Would Aidid be prepared to assume the post of 
president? 
  [Abdullatif] If he is called upon do so, he will. In the 
end, he is a prominent person, and it was he who chased the 
former dictator Barre out of the country. However, we will not 
resort to weapons and democratic elections will be held. 
  [Kretz] Don't you need foreign assistance to rebuild the 
country? 
  [Abdullatif] We have established contacts with other African 
countries that will assist us in reconstruction. We would like 
Germany to be the first European country that we will visit. We 
told that to the German ambassador in Nairobi, and we would 
welcome German assistance. The Germans are always welcome in 
Somalia. The condition is that they do not come in uniforms.

  [Excerpt] President Yoweri Museveni has held a meeting with 
the Belgian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs, Mr. Willy Claes. The meeting took place at State House 
in Kampala. During the meeting, Mr. Claes briefed the president 
about the steps being taken by the EC to strengthen and enhance 
cooperation. He said that Belgium is ready to enhance 
cooperation with Uganda, as well as encourage regional 
cooperation and integration on the continent. He said that 
Africa now needs to strengthen regional cooperation because the 
regional alternative ensures peace and stability, which are 
essential for development. 
  President Museveni told the Belgian foreign minister that 
Uganda emphasizes neutrality (?when) dealing with developed 
nations. He said developed countries could work beneficially 
with Uganda by concentrating on investment and trade, as well as 
giving soft loans that would help the government in capacity 
building. [passage omitted]

  [Text] State President F.W. de Klerk has asked Afrikaner 
Volksfront [National Front] leader General Constand Viljoen to 
direct his followers away from commenting violence. 
  President de Klerk said at Postmasburg in the northern Cape 
that room has been created for Gen. Viljoen's strategic 
volkstaat [homeland] option. According to the state president, 
Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg was engaging in 
petty party politics by rejecting the latest constitutional 
proposals. 
  President de Klerk had earlier said that he was prepared to 
testify before the Independent Electoral Commission on 
intimidation after another one of his meetings at Postdene, just 
outside Postmasburg, was disrupted. He said several cases of 
intimidation with the relevant evidence have already been 
presented by the National Party to the commission, and it has 
been said that such evidence was too vague. President de Klerk 
said that today he had been an eyewitness of intimidation in 
which people had apparently been provided with official ANC 
[African National Congress] flags, banners, and placards. 
  The state president has canceled this evening's planned 
visit 
to (Agaleshuwe) just outside Kimberly. He said the move is 
aimed at his supporters' safety in the township as two vehicles 
have already been reported burned.

<F P=106> [Report by Amrit Manga] </F>
  [Text] Most political parties have dropped their pretences 
at diplomacy and have hauled out their electioneering artillery 
in preparation for what promises to be a bruising battle for 
power. But the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has maintained a 
noticeable subdued election profile. It is the only one of the 
four major parties contesting the elections for both the 
national and provincial assemblies that has not yet begun 
campaigning in earnest. 
  In the past week, it tried to dispel speculation that its 
low 
profile is due to financial difficulties. Unlike other parties, 
the PAC went along to the Independent Electoral Commission with 
R[rand]70,000 in crisp notes to pay its deposit for registration 
as a political party. But it has delayed the unveiling of a 
detailed manifesto three times. This is now expected to be made 
public next week. However, the PAC itself is attaching little 
weight to such a programme. Its emphasis is on intense 
campaigning at grassroots level. 
  This partly explains why the organisation has done little in 
the way of election rallies and mass meetings to project a 
public profile. This is except for its December national 
congress in Umtata which ratified participation in the election. 
But its low election profile may well be due to the controversy 
surrounding the decision to contest the April polls. Not all in 
the PAC, for example, agree that the armed struggle should be 
suspended in preparation for participation in the elections. 
But PAC officials disagree that the launch of the campaign has 
been delayed and do not seem unduly perturbed by dissension in 
the eastern Cape, arguing that it is limited to a few 
individuals. The organisation, they say, has concentrated its 
efforts at the grassroots level rather than the media. 
  In any case, the PAC's December conference satisfied itself 
that tactical and strategic considerations debated by delegates 
provide a sound basis for participation in the polls, the 
officials say. 
  PAC foreign affairs chief Gora Ebrahim argues: "The 
principle that the PAC has been pursuing all along is that the 
election must be for a constituent assembly, whose primary task 
must be draw up the new non-racial democratic constitution. The 
PAC's national conference on December 16 1993 was satisfied that 
the April elections would be for a constituent assembly to draw 
up a new, non-racial, democratic constitution. It therefore 
meets the PAC's primary demand and, on that basis, we will 
participate in the coming election." 
  While the PAC is content with the primary objective of the 
April elections, its decision to participate was not an 
unqualified one. Ebrahim says his organisation will be sitting 
in the constituent assembly but will not consider itself bound 
by any of the constitional principles agreed upon by other 
participants at the multi-party talks last year. "The PAC 
congress has taken a decision that we are going into an election 
for an unfettered constitutional assembly [CA]. We believe that 
the elected people cannot be bound by an unelected group's 
decisions." 
  Ebrahim adds that the PAC only considers itself bound by 
those principles that are enumerated and enshrined in the 1989 
Consensus Declaration of the United Nations. Included in this 
declaration are basic principles binding parties to a 
multi-party democracy, a universally accepted Bill of Rights, an 
independent judiciary, regular elections etc. It does not 
consider itself bound by principles providing limited powers for 
regional government or those allowing for a Government of 
National Unity (GNU). 
  "There are also other deals, struck between the ANC [African 
National Congress] and the NP [National Party], that the PAC is 
not bound by," says Ebrahim. Among these is the deal which 
effectively resulted in the decision at multi-party talks for a 
single ballot in the April elections, he says. Ebrahim added 
that, as things stand, the PAC would not participate in the 
Transitional Executive Council (TEC). But this is not an open 
and shut case -- "We are still involved in talks with the 
government and hope that obstacles in the way of the PAC joining 
the TEC will be removed." One of these obstacles revolves around 
the control over the security forces in the period up to the 
elections. 
  The PAC believes the government remains in control of the 
army and police while the TEC only has jurisdiction over 
liberation armies and homeland security forces. It is of the 
view that all armed forces, including the SA [South African] 
Defence Force and the South African Police, should come under 
TEC command. 
  Just how successful the PAC will be in getting its way is, 
however, in question. It has, for example, already sacrificed 
an important bargaining chip -- the armed struggle. And some 
dissension in its ranks relates to the PAC's suspension of the 
armed campaign without having secured the necessary changes to 
the TEC Act. 
  There is also no certainty that the organisation will 
participate in the GNU, which it remains opposed to in terms of 
its own principles and understanding of what constitutes a 
democracy. But there remains a possibility that the PAC will 
join the GNU if it believes this will serve its strategic 
interests. Participation in the GNU will depend on the same 
process of debate and assessment that went into determining the 
strategic value of participating in the multi-party negotiating 
council, says Ebrahim. 
  "If we find that we can meaningfully make a contribution, we 
will participate in the GNU." But a final decision will only be 
taken when the GNU is established, says Ebrahim, cautioning that 
the pros and cons of participation have not yet come up for 
discussion. 
  This decision will be informed by the PAC's capacity to 
influence the final constitution. And this in turn depends on 
the support the organisation enjoys among South African voters, 
Ebrahim explains. 
  But, if recent opinion polls are anything to go by, the PAC 
is unlikely to muster the support of more than two percent of 
the country's estimated 22.5-million voters. 
  While Ebrahim agrees that its clout at the CA will depend on 
the support it can mobilise in the runup to the elections, he 
disputes the accuracy of the opinion polls. "These polls do not 
affect us in the least when we examine them against reports, 
from delegates throughout the country, of our strength at the 
grassroots level. We took a very firm decision to participate in 
the elections despite these strange polls -- in our view, the 
only thing that these polls will prove is how wrong they were." 
  Ebrahim says a PAC study has shown, that of an estimated 21- 
million voters in the country, only four to five million were 
committed or card-carrying members of political parties. "You 
have between 15- and 16-million voters out there who make up the 
floating vote. Our study shows that this floating vote will 
vote on the basis of two considerations," says Ebrahim. 
  At one level, these voters' choice will be based on their 
perception of different political organisations: "is it 
principled, has it compromised, has it compromised too much, is 
it involved in violence?" 
  "These are some of the questions the floating majority will 
ask before they cast their votes," says Ebrahim. 
  "But the builk of this majority will cast its votes on 
straightforward bread and butter issues such as security, 
housing, employment, land, education and health. We have found 
that the bulk of the people are literally doing shopping and 
that is why people want to know what parties are offering. We 
also found that there has been a fundamental change in the 
thinking of our people in the post-February 1990 period. Prior 
to this period, we found that people would support you for 
simply opposing the regime. Today, they want to know what's in 
it for them." 
  Ebrahim is confident that his party will capture a sizable 
part of the floating vote because it has a strong message and 
programme that addresses every one of the bread and butter 
concerns. "We are not perceived in the townships as being 
involved in violence and that is a major asset in those areas 
where violence is endemic. We also know that no political 
organisation in the world wins an election on the basis of its 
membership -- more important is what's on offer. For all these 
reasons, we think we stand an excellent chance of winning a 
substantial majority," Ebrahim says without a hint of doubt. 
  He adds that it was against the background of these 
considerations that the Umtata conference decided to contest the 
elections, confident that the PAC has the ingredients to capture 
the floating vote. 
  Its success will, however, depend on its election manifesto, 
which is expected to be unveiled next week. Ebrahim would not 
speculate on the manifesto's contents. Asked whether it would 
focus exclusively on constitutional issues, given that the PAC 
sees the elections as nothing more than an exercise in electing 
a constituent assembly, Ebrahim said no. He says that, while 
the PAC will be asking voters for a mandate to write a new 
constitution, its manifesto will also focus on programmes to 
deliver on bread and butter issues. It will therefore reflect 
issues such as the PAC's economic policy. 
  While the manifesto will contain more than just 
constitutional matters relevant to a mandate for a constituent 
assembly, Ebrahim maintains that the PAC's goal is not 
government office but seats in a constituent assembly. 
  He is cagey about PAC participation in a GNU if it wins a 
substantial majority. He argues that this will partly be 
determined by how long it takes to draw up the constitution, 
which in turn will depend on the outcome of the election. 
  "It is possible that the constitution could be drawn up in 
six weeks if the elections deliver a decisive majority to any 
one party. But, even if there are many parties with a more or 
less equal distribution of the vote, the election will ensure 
that no party will be in a position to make exaggerated demands. 
If, for example, a party wins 10 percent of the vote, it cannot 
demand 90 percent of the vote in determining the form of the 
constitution -- so it brings reality to the negotiations process 
in terms of what is attainable." 
  Ebrahim argues that if parties emerge from the elections 
without any one group enjoying a significant majority, the 
constitution- making process could take a long time. "But, 
assuming the PAC wins a significant majority and we are able to 
draw up a constitution within six weeks, then we must decide 
whether we will still be governed by an interim constitution for 
another five years thereafter. 
  "It is possible," Ebrahim argues, "that the new constitution 
will demand that we have an election after six months. Then 
there will be need to continue with the GNU." 
  The other option for the PAC, if it does not obtain an 
absolute majority, is to remain outside of the GNU as an 
opposition. Ebrahim would not say whether it would then 
function as a parliamentary resistance opposition. That would 
depend on how the party is treated by the GNU, he says. "It is 
not prudent for the PAC to say how it will function in the 
post-April election period before the outcome of the election," 
says Ebrahim. 
  What is certain is that, if the PAC wins a majority and is 
able to, together with minority parties, write up a new 
constitution, it will ignore what it says is a deal between the 
NP and the ANC to run the country through a government of 
national unity.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 24 SAPA -- Voting procedure for the 
April election was announced on Thursday [24 February] by the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. Voters will have their 
identification checked at the doors of polling stations where 
party voting agents will also conduct ID checks. The voter will 
have both hands studied under ultra-violet lights. 
  The voter's knuckles will then be dipped in an invisible but 
UV sensitive marking fluid which will wear off in about a week. 
The voter will hand in his identity document or temporary voter 
card to an official who will mark it and then a ballot paper 
will be given to the voter with the ID document. The voter will 
then go to one of the voting compartments and vote in secret 
before placing the ballot paper into a ballot box for the 
National Assembly election. 
  The voter then moves to another table where his ID is 
checked 
again before a second ballot paper, this time for the provincial 
legislature, is folded and handed to the voter. 
  The voter then votes again in secret and casts the ballot in 
a box marked for the provincial legislature election, the IEC 
announced at a press conference at the World Trade Centre.

<F P=106> [From the Channel Africa report program] </F>
  [Text] The secretary general of the Organization of African 
Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim, has held talks with the South African 
Government. He's on the third day of a week-long visit to the 
country, and after the talks the South African Foreign Affairs 
Minister Pik Botha stressed that the country must not become a 
new headache for the rest of Africa. 
  [Begin recording] [Botha] I would urge all South Africans to 
take note of the importance that Mr. Salim is attaching to this 
country. He has come here. He's a man with great problems 
himself that he must face in Africa, and he's come here with a 
top delegation because of his interest in us, because of the 
contribution that he wants to make to resolve our internal 
problems amongst the parties. And it is against this background 
that we have had a thorough exchange of the problems facing us, 
and I can say that I'm impressed with his objective and clinical 
analysis of the situation as he sees it. 
  [Salim] We think that it is very important for the leaders 
of 
South Africa and for the people of South Africa to look and 
prepare beyond the coming elections. We want to see a strong 
South Africa. We want to see South Africa as being one of the 
key parts in the resolution of African problems -- not to be a 
focus of Africa's attention in resolving South African problems. 
We have had very, very useful, very extensive discussions with 
the minister. We have known each other for a long time. Those 
were difficult days, but it's such refreshing and such rewarding 
to come and discuss in an atmosphere of understanding, of 
concord, of almost identity of use on some or almost all the 
major issues that face our continent, and also that face South 
Africa. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Democracy To Depend on Multiparty Political Center -- 
Hermann 
Giliomee writes in an article on page 16 of Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 25 February that "the entire transition to 
democracy in South Africa turns on the construction and defence 
of a new multiparty political centre." The attempt to lure 
parties of the Freedom Alliance (FA) into the constituional 
process "represents the first serious effort by the ANC [African 
National Congress] and the NP [National Party] to defend this 
centre. That this defence is unlikely to succeed in its 
immediate objective -- to get the alliance into the elections -- 
does not mean that a form of accommodation with the alliance 
over the longer term can be ruled out." Giliomee believes we 
have seen since December "a spirited and concentrated effort by 
disparate forces to broaden the centre and make the future 
democracy more viable." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Criticism of ANC's Concessions Timing -- Billy Paddock 
writes 
in a page-10 article in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 
25 February that "there is a view among some ANC stategists that 
the organisation may have committed a grievous error by 
footdragging late last year instead of offering at that early 
stage the concessions placed on the table in the past week." 
"It is true that the recent package of concessions does not 
fully meet the alliance's requirements. In particular, it falls 
far short of Inkatha's demand for a federal dispensation. But 
it goes a long way towards meeting the compromise package 
contained in the December 19 document which was worked out 
between government and the alliance. Had the concessions come 
then -- rather than a firm rejection from the ANC -- this could 
have created space for constructive negotiation, further 
compromise and a possible settlement, the argument goes." 
<H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>
  Elections Never `Absolutely Free and Fair' -- "Clearly, the 
ballot will never be absolutely free and fair. The question is 
whether the disruption can be limited enough for the Independent 
Electoral Commission and the international observer missions to 
get away with a ruling that these elections are sufficiently 
free and fair to pass muster," notes a page-16 editorial in 
Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 25 
February-3 
March. "It is becoming increasingly obvious that in significant 
areas of Natal/kwaZulu polling will be difficult and probably 
impossible. It is extraordinary that there is so little visible 
action to stop rightwing training of Inkatha impis [warriors] 
and to break the power of the kwaZulu Police to take sides." 
The editorial also looks at the disruption of NP electioneering 
in the Cape, saying it should "also be addressed urgently by 
African National Congress leaders." "Free and fair elections -- 
like fair cricket umpiring -- are not going to come easy." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  PAC's Commitment to Democracy `Fragile' -- Johannesburg 
BEELD 
in Afrikaans on 22 February says in a page-10 editorial: "The 
threat by the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] that it will return 
to the armed struggle if it does not get its way with the 
redistribution of land indicates that this party's commitment to 
democracy and the ballot is very fragile. It was a precondition 
for the PAC's participation in the election that it renounce 
violence. Now it appears that the party is setting laughable 
demands expecting to realize them through the use of violence. 
Other parties which are participating in the election and are 
prepared to accept the outcome unconditionally will have to 
decide whether they wish to compete at the polls on such an 
unequal basis with a party which refuses to play by the rules of 
the game." "The PAC's manifesto in which laughable promises are 
made such as that all private land transactions will be 
abolished when land is returned to 'the people' underlines the 
fact that this party does not have the faintest idea of the 
demands of a modern society." 
  Alliance Leaders Incapable of Playing Role -- "Another 
chapter in the dynamic process in South Africa is approaching 
completion and still the leaders of the FA hesitate, apparently 
incapable of themselves playing a role in it," says a page-14 
editorial in Johannesburg BEELD of 23 February. "The 
Negotiating Council has now made it even easier for the FA 
leaders to enter the process with even more concessions than the 
government and the ANC had been prepared to make. Virtually all 
of the remaining objections of the alliance have now been 
removed." "If the FA leaders are undecided, powerless, 
hesitant, or stubborn, their followers need not also be left 
behind by history. There is a way they can become part of the 
dynamic process, and that is to vote in the election for a 
different party which can represent their interests." 
  Sarajevo Holds Lesson for RSA -- A second editorial on page 
14 of BEELD says: "From the rubble and tears of Sarajevo, where 
people allowed political intolerance to degenerate into a 
campaign of ethnic cleansing, a dazed resident warns 
despairingly that no one can help them unless they help 
themselves. Therein lies a profound lesson for South Africa 
with its comlex ethnic make-up. Not even the intervention of 
the United Nations can end the slaughter in Bosnia." "South 
African politicians and others who use war talk to bedevil 
efforts at a settlement should realize before it is too late 
that in the final analysis no one will be able to help us here. 
We must help ourselves. One political commentator has already 
warned that the ethnic cleansing which we see in Bosnia has 
already started here in South Africa."

  [Text] The Kunge Commune, 5 km from the city of Cuito, in 
Bie Province, was intensely shelled by Jonas Savimbi's men 
yesterday afternoon. Despite the intense fire, the government 
forces stopped the advance of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Our correspondent reports. 
  UNITA men attacked the Kunge Commune yesterday afternoon. 
Brigadier Mukume, second commander of the Angolan Armed Forces 
[FAA] in Bie, said about three UNITA battalions attacked the 
commune yesterday afternoon. Brig. Mukume told our reporting 
team the FAA forces stationed in the area are in total control 
of the situation. 
  Estevao Daniel Kassoma, deputy provincial governor of Bie, 
has revealed that UNITA rebels are preparing an attack on the 
city of Cuito. Estevao Daniel Kassoma told the local press that 
in recent days Savimbi's men moved more than one dozen military 
vehicles, as well as troops and war materiel to the outskirts of 
Cuito with a view to reinforcing its positions. 
  In Menongue, Cuando Cubango Province, UNITA recently shelled 
FAA positions and continues to plant mines on the main roads 
leading to the city. Our correspondents in Menongue say on 21 
February, UNITA launched various 81-mm mortar shells against the 
city, but the FAA response was quick and vigorous and Menongue 
continues under the control of the government forces.

  [Text] There is not much hope coming from the peace talks 
in Lusaka, Zambia. The parties are discussing one of the last 
points on the agenda, but peace still seems to be far away. Our 
correspondent Joao Ligio reports. 
  The mediators have finally drawn up the third version on 
specific principles, but it has not obtained the agreement of 
all parties as the UN officials had thought. This morning, the 
government and the mediators needed no more than 15 minutes to 
reach an agreement on the specific principles for national 
reconciliation. They were, however, confronted with the 
viewpoints of the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA]. 
  Late this afternoon, there was a major exchange of 
correspondence revealing that there was a new version from the 
mediators. The government delegation, reinforced with the 
presence of two more army generals, held its own meeting and 
this evening left for a meeting with Alioune Blondin Beye, 
special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola. 
  A lengthy plenary meeting was then held, but the distance 
separating the parties has not reduced and the discussions are 
characterized by a threatening tone. For certain observers, 
attempts to reach an agreement were dashed because, despite 
changing its initial stand, UNITA has neither reduced the number 
of its demands, nor withdrawn the stand which the government 
consider unacceptable -- the desire for power sharing.

  [Text] The president of the Republic, Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos, is in France. On the second day of his visit, the 
Angolan head of state held to a tight agenda. Tomorrow, he will 
meet French President Francis Mitterrand. After meeting French 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur today, Eduardo dos Santos said 
he has not gone to France to get weapons but to discuss peace 
and economics. Our Paris correspondent reports: 
  President Jose Eduardo Santos will shortly speak at an 
official dinner hosted by the French Foreign Ministry. The 
speech, which will be followed with great attention by French 
Government officials, is likely to deal with the Angolan 
Government's economic program, and the dramatic situation faced 
by millions of Angolans as a result of the unjust war waged by 
Jonas Savimbi's organization. This afternoon, the Angolan head 
of state had a working session with the French prime minister. 
At the end of the meeting, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
said: 
  [Begin Santos recording, in French fading into Portuguese 
translation] We have reviewed bilateral cooperation, notably 
economic cooperation. We briefed the French prime minister 
about the ongoing Lusaka peace talks between government and 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
delegations. We informed the French prime minister about the 
economic recovery program the Angolan Government plans to 
introduce. 
  We have not come to Paris to ask for military aid from the 
French Government. We have not discussed military issues, but 
rather matters relating to peace and politics. 
  As for the peace talks, we have gone to Lusaka to find a 
solution to the Angolan problem. [end recording] 
  Also this afternoon, the Angolan head of state met 
government 
and party officials. Tomorrow, he is scheduled to hold further 
meetings, notably with President Mitterrand. Afterward, the two 
leaders will lunch together. A news conference is scheduled for 
1730 tomorrow, during which Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos will discuss his visit to France.

  [Text] The four-day national constitutional conference 
ended today at (Kwacha) International Conference Center in 
Blantyre, with delegates approving the draft constitution, but 
also calling on the NCC [National Consultative Council] to 
contribute to the issue. Our correspondent says the delegates, 
among other issues, urged the NCC to redouble its efforts to 
ensure that the constitution becomes effective immediately after 
the forthcoming multiparty general elections. The conference 
also recommended that Malawi's traditional and moral values be 
included in the constitution in such a way that they stand to 
take (?their turn). 
  And in their speeches during the closing session, leaders 
[words indistinct] representatives of the various political 
parties thanked the NCC for organizing the conference. They 
said the conference had rendered their parties the opportunity 
to contribute their views on the draft constitution. 
  In his remarks, the UNDP [UN Development Program] resident 
representative in Malawi, Mr. (Michael Haynes), said the 
conference was a historic moment for Malawi, because it has 
provided an opportunity for laying a foundation for a new 
constitution for the country.

  [Text] Former Swaziland's High Commissioner in Canada, Mrs 
Madzandza Mary Khanya has been appointed Ambassador of Swaziland 
to the United States of America with effect from tomorrow. Mrs 
Khanya will take over from Mr Vusi Mamba who has been recalled. 
  This was announced yesterday by the Prime Minister [PM], 
Prince Mbilini as part of the major reshuffle programme in 
government. Taking over as High Commissioner in Canada is the 
former police chief, Mr Sandile Mdziniso. 
  Mrs Khanya was the first lady envoy appointed Swaziland's 
High Commissioner in Canada in 1990. Former Chief of Protocol, 
Mr Harry Mabuza has been appointed Ambassador of Swaziland to 
Mozambique.

Khanya to the United States of America." he said.

  [Text] Lagos, 24 Feb (PANA)--Nigeria has no intention of 
going to war with neighbouring Cameroon, with which it is 
currently involved in a territorial dispute, Brigadier General 
Fred Chijuka, director of defence information said Thursday [24 
February] in Lagos. He said that Nigeria remains committed to 
peace in the West African sub-region. 
  The defence spokesman, who was commenting on Wednesday's 
visit by a Cameroonian Government delegation to Nigeria's 
military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha on the disputed Bakassi 
Peninsula, said Nigeria "was happy at this initiative." 
"Nigeria has no desire to go to war with Cameroon", he said 
adding: "With this visit, the Cameroonian Government has seen 
that the path of peace is preferable to that of war". Chijuka 
said Nigeria's military strength and preparedness should not be 
underestimated in spite of the fact that some 12,000 of its 
troops are currently serving in ECOMOG [Economic Community of 
West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], the West 
African peace-keeping force in Liberia. 
  A meeting between Gen. Abacha and President Paul Biya of 
Cameroon is in the pipeline, in an attempt to find a peaceful 
solution to the differences between the two countries. No date 
has been set for Biya's visit, seen as the highest level of 
diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the long-standing dispute 
over the oil rich Bakassi Peninsula in south-eastern part of 
Nigeria. 
  Cameroon alleged last weekend that its troops were attacked 
by Nigerian troops in the disputed territory, a claim which 
Nigeria denied. Cameroon also claimed that Nigeria has been 
occupying parts of the disputed land illegally since 21 
December. Nigeria alleged that 30 of its villages had been 
burnt, many villagers killed or maimed and women raped.

  [Summary From Poor Reception] The present administration in 
the country is 100 days old in office. It come into power on 17 
November 1993 with a broadcast by the head of state, General 
Sani Abacha. 
  "Nigerians have been speaking on the performance of the 
administration since its assuming office. While some believe 
that 100 days were still short to assess the performance of the 
administration, others say the government has done well so far." 
"Many people feel that the government has not done much in its 
first 100 days," but some have a "different opinion considering 
all that happened before the coming to power of this 
administration." They think "it will take a rather long time 
for things to normalize." Some say that the political situation 
and the political crisis that prevailed in the country have been 
brought to normal and that "Nigerians have become one once 
again." They add that when the national conference comes on it 
is then Nigerians will know exactly what Abacha has done. 
  Some Nigerians say that all government institutions are now 
performing well which is a very good beginning that gives credit 
to the present government. They say the government has taken 
the bull by the horn by engaging into an area which "the 
previous governments never looked into like trying to sanitize 
the Nigerian society."

  [Text] It was learned from authoritative sources that the 
two main opposition leaders in Senegal -- Abdoulaye Wade and 
Landing Savane -- were today charged with "threatening state 
security," following investigations into riots in Dakar that 
left eight persons dead, including six policemen. Wade and 
Savane, secretary general of the Senegalese Democratic Party, 
PDS, and the African Party for Democracy and Socialism, PADS, 
respectively, were arrested on 18 February, 48 hours after the 
riots, and were remanded in custody. 
  Wade's lawyer and an official of PADS have both confirmed 
the 
charges. The two opposition leaders' period in custody had been 
extended twice, on 20 and 22 February. 
  Sixty-five other people were brought before the 
investigating 
judge, to prefer charges against them all, judicial sources said.

  [Text] Lome 24, Feb (AFP) -- The Togolese opposition is 
ready to withdraw its candidates if, as President Gnassingbe 
Eyadema's supporters demanded, the Supreme Court should annul 
the poll in five of the constituencies it won during the 
legislative elections. This was stated by an opposition leader 
to AFP today. "We are not ready to go to a third round. If 
they impose it on us, we will withdraw," said the source, who 
preferred not to be named. 
  The opposition, represented by the Action Committee for 
Renewal, CAR, and the Togolese Union for Democracy, UTD, 
unofficially won 43 seats -- 36 by CAR and seven by UTD -- which 
is two seats over the number required for absolute majority. 
The parties from the presidential camp obtained 37, and the 
remaining one was won by Joseph Kokou Koffigoh, the transitional 
prime minister, who is a centrist. 
  This opposition leader disclosed that the CAR and UTD 
representatives this morning went to the International Followup 
Committee, which comprises Burkinabe, French, German, Egyptian, 
and American delegates, to denounce the "illegal attitude" of 
the National Electoral Commission, CEN. 
  Yesterday evening, this commission transferred the entire 
results of the second round to the Supreme Court, but refrained 
from officially publishing those concerning the challenged five 
constituencies. Waiting for the magistrates' decision -- to be 
made on 13 March at the latest -- political consultations 
continued in Lome yesterday. 
  UTD General Secretary Ata Messan Ajavon described as 
"erroneous" the rumors that his party allegedly held contacts 
with the Rally of the Togolese People, RPT, the pro-Eyadema 
party. 
  From a reliable source within the UTD it was, however, 
confirmed that many meetings had taken place since yesterday 
with the CAR leader to "coordinate the attitude" of the two 
opposition parties. "In view of the electoral results, which 
force us to be a small party, we do not ask for anything. Our 
condition does not allow us to do so," this source stated, 
adding that the UTD intended to play its role as a 
"buffer-party." Mr. Koffigoh, who is the only elected candidate 
of the Convention of New Forces, also wants to play this role. 
He reminded AFP that he was not an "RPT member" and that his 
party represented "a completely different leaning."

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Togo's electorate and politicians are having to 
wait even longer for the results from four crucial 
constituencies in last week's general elections. The opposition 
is neck and neck with President Eyadema's party, but there have 
been cries of foul over the conduct of the poll in the remaining 
four seats, which were regarded as in the bag for the 
opposition. Now the electoral commission has handed it all over 
to the Supreme Court for ratification. But it seems some of the 
commissioners are far from happy. From Lome, Ebow Godwin 
reports: 
  [Begin Godwin recording] Togo's National Electoral 
Commission waded into deep crisis today following decision by 
four opposition members serving on the commission to resign 
their posts. The resignation of the four follows the delay by 
the commission in releasing results of voting in five 
constituencies in which voting was disrupted by violence during 
last Sunday's second round of voting. A spokesman for the 
opposition representative, Pastor Lawson, told reporters that 
they were pulling out of the commission because of intimidation. 
  Yesterday, Togo's electoral commission said it was 
withholding results from the five disputed constituencies 
pending a ruling by the Supreme Court. That decision came only 
a few hours to the 72-hour deadline within which the commission 
was required by law to publish all provisional election results. 
Yesterday's statement said that the commission has submitted 
all 19 results out of the outstanding 24 constituencies to the 
Supreme Court for ratification. But opposition sources said they 
have no confidence in the country's constitutional chamber of 
the Supreme Court which has to determine petitions, because it 
is filled with appointees of President Gnassingbe Eyadema. 
Currently, the constituencies under litigation include two in 
Wawa, in the north, one in Haho in southern Togo, one in Sokode 
in central Togo, and one in the Lome metropolis. 
  Under Togo's electoral laws, Togo's Supreme Court has 15 
days 
within which to make a ruling on the petition. [end recording]

  [Text] The president of the Republic, General Gnassingbe

held a meeting at the president's Lome II residence. The talks 
between the two men lasted for more than an hour. This was the 
first meeting between the two leaders of the executive branch of 
government after the second round of the legislative elections. 
  Provisional results from 19 constituencies out of the 24 
whose candidates were neck and neck were released yesterday by 
the National Electoral Commission. The commission then 
submitted the partial results to the Supreme Court, which has a 
maximum of 15 days to proclaim the final results, after ruling 
on all cases of litigation.

  [Text] A cease-fire has been signed between the Chadian 
Government and Moise Kette's rebel movement. This is the first 
concrete result of peace talks, which began on Tuesday [22 
February] in Bangui in the Central African Republic. Talks are 
continuing today. The rebel movement, the National Awakening 
Committee for Peace and Democracy [Comite de Sursaut National 
pour la Paix et la Democratie -- CSNPD] is calling for a 
referendum on setting up a federal state in Chad. Moise Kette 
explained the request: 
  [Begin Kette recording] We will be examining the second 
condition, relating to the organization of a referendum on the 
form of the state. The unitary state has exacerbated the 
tensions between the different communities to such an extent 
that we feel that, in order to preserve the very unity of Chad, 
it has become important to reconsider the form of the state. If 
the people vote, the CSNPD will respect their verdict. We are 
not going to impose federalism by decree, but we think that the 
people are sovereign and that they have to be consulted. If we 
do this, it is in the interest of the Chadian people. Some 
people think that federalism means secession. Far from it, we 
see it rather as a form of management; we have to try to adapt, 
the least we can do is to try. If, in the long term, we find 
that federalism is not appropriate, then we can return to the 
unitary model. [end recording]

  [Text] Cape Town Feb 24 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Thursday [24 February] night 
said the latest government proposal on the position of the Zulu 
king in a future constitutional dispensation -- as forwarded by 
the government on Thursday afternoon -- could be accepted as "a 
basis" for further discussions and negotiations on the issue. 
The proposals arose out of two days of discussions between a 
South African Government delegation and emissaries from King 
Goodwill Zwelithini and a delegation from the IFP. 
  A statement issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs late on 
Thursday night said "he (Mr Buthelezi) said he was in favour of 
further urgent talks on the aforesaid proposals". 
  Ministry spokesman Niel du Bois said Mr Buthelezi's 
acceptance of the proposals as a basis for further urgent 
discussions on the issue was a "breakthrough" which "laid the 
foundation for further urgent talks which could open the door 
for the participation of the IFP in the election". 
  The constitutional talks ended provisionally on Thursday 
afternoon at an undisclosed venue outside Cape Town to allow the 
parties to report back to their principals. 
  Minister of Home Affairs Danie Schutte, who also headed the 
government delegation at the talks, said he had spoken to Mr 
Buthelezi late on Thursday night when the kwaZulu chief minister 
had said he was indeed in favour of further urgent talks on the 
aforesaid proposals. 
  The proposals which resulted from the two-day meeting 
between 
the government, the emmissaries and the IFP were put to King 
Goodwill and Mr Buthelezi who faxed his reply to Mr Schutte late 
on Thursday night. 
  Mr du Bois said in a statement that further talks on the 
position of the king in a future dispensation as well related 
matters would have to take place on Friday, February 25, "before 
the finalisation of amendments to the constitution by the joint 
committee of Parliament on constitutional matters which sits 
today (Friday)." Mr du Bois told SAPA plans were being devised 
to see "how it can be practically possible to get the 
negotiators together" to further discuss the issues. 
  The discussions between the government, emmissaries from 
King 
Goodwill and the IFP delegation were the result of a meeting 
between the king and State President F. W. de Klerk in Pretoria 
on Tuesday.

  [Excerpt] Bujumbura, 28 Feb (ABP-BUR/PANA)--At least ten 
civilians were killed and a number of policemen injured in 
shootings which occurred in Bujumbura Saturday [26 February] and 
Sunday night, in the capital of the central African state of 
Burundi, the city's mayor said Monday. 
  It was the first bloody weekend since the installation of 
President Cyprien Ntaryamira on 5 February as Burundi's new 
president, following the assassination of his democratically 
elected successor, Melchior Ndadaye, in a tribal-inspired coup 
attempt in October last year. 
  Automatic arm gunshots and hand grenade explosions were held 
throughout Sunday night in Bujumbura. The mayor of Bujumbura 
said in a telephone interview with PANA Monday that those 
involved in the shooting were driving in private vehicles. He 
added that these assailants mainly targeted positions where 
gendarmes were located. A number of the security personnel were 
injured. He did not specify the health situation of those who 
were injured. 
  Asked to state the objective of the violence, the mayor 
claimed that the people involved were opposed to Monday's 
re-opening of schools in Burundi for various reasons. According 
to him, some of the groups still had some relatives who were 
still in exile abroad or had their families living as displaced 
persons within school premises for lack of anywhere else to go. 
  In a radio and televised message to the nation Sunday night, 
President Ntaryamira warned parents that indisciplined students 
and those who take extreme actions against their colleagues 
would be rusticated. Schools were closed in Burundi following 
the widespread violence which broke out among the Tutsi and Hutu 
tribesmen after the assassination of Ndadaye, barely three 
months after his election as president. [passage omitted]

Base. They are heading toward (Ida Bato). At (Ida Bato), the 
minister of defense had an idea of the situation following a 
briefing by Captain (Decorvet Bolore) and a commander of the 
battalion in charge of a commando group. "Everywhere, the 
defense minister was sufficiently informed about the situation 
in the field, thanks to the information given him by senior 
officers supervising the operations." Despite the difficult 
conditions in which the soldiers are living, "the morale of our 
troops is high. There is no doubt that the visit by their 
minister has brought them some joy to the heart," especially 
when he shared a meal with them. "On the way back, the troops 
stationed at (Istangele) and (Egbounou) were also inspected." 
It is important to note that the Cameroonian people living the 
region who had deserted the place have been returning to their 
village. [end recording]

  [Text] State radio in Cameroon has given an account of 
fighting which took place early this month in the Bakassi 
Peninsula area which is disputed with Nigeria. It quoted a 
Cameroonian military official as saying 10 Nigerian boats, each 
carrying about 10 soldiers, had attacked a Cameroonian position. 
The radio said two of the boats were sunk and one Cameroonian 
soldier was killed and one wounded in the exchange nine days 
ago. A delegation from Cameroon has since held talks in Nigeria 
aimed at reducing tension.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Paris says it is very preoccupied 
with the Nigerian-Cameroonian border conflict, and has been in 
contact with Yaounde to gather the most complete information on 
the issue. Regarding this, a French diplomatic and military 
mission arrived in our capital this afternoon. It was welcomed 
at the Yaounde Air Force Base by a delegation led by the chief 
of general staff, Pierre Temenge. Joseph Ley, you have just 
returned from the Yaounde Air Force Base where you really saw 
the disembarkment of a detachment of French paratroopers from 
Bangui, Central African Republic [CAR]. 
  [Ley] Yes, Charles. At 1525, a French Air Force Transal 
aircraft landed at the Yaounde Military Base. The heavy-duty 
transport aircraft was carrying a detachment of French 
paratroopers and two military jeeps. As you said, they came 
from Bangui, the CAR. Fifty minutes later, two [name 
indistinct] helicopters, which generally serve as a support for 
land troops, also landed at the military base with equipment and 
some men. The equipment and the men were welcomed by a 
high-level delegation led by General Pierre Temenge, the chief 
of general staff. Also included in the delegation were General 
Claude Meka, the commander of the Yaounde headquarters and of 
the first military region; Colonel Paul Yakana Yebama, the chief 
of air staff; Commander Etoga, commander of the Yaounde Air 
Force Base; and several other Cameroonian military officers. 
  On the French side, it was Colonel (Ballaman), military 
attache at the French Embassy in Yaounde, who led the welcoming 
committee. According to a French military official, for now 
these men and their equipment will remain here in Yaounde. They 
will only be deployed in the case of necessity and [words 
indistinct] on the Cameroonian side. 
  France has reacted militarily, but it has also reacted 
diplomatically, because a French diplomatic mission from Paris 
arrived at the Yaounde International Airport late this 
afternoon. This delegation is made up of officials concerned 
with African and Malagasy affairs at the Elysees and at the 
French Foreign Service. In addition to this the French Embassy 
has just presented to us the following statement from the 
spokesman of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated 25 
February. The statement reads: France is very concerned by the 
tension currently reigning between Nigeria and Cameroon. This 
follows the entry of Nigerian forces into the Bakasi Peninsula 
and the clashes that took place on 18 February. France is 
attentively following the evolution of the situation in the 
field and in New York, where Cameroon has called for an 
emergency meeting of the Security Council. France is in 
permanent contact with the authorities of the two countries. It 
is making efforts to ensure that any act that may lead to a 
further degradation in the situation is avoided, and that a 
peaceful settlement is found to the dispute. To this end, in 
collaboration with its partners, the French Government has 
embarked on diplomatic action, both on the bilateral and 
international levels, where this affair might be discussed. The 
European Union is also intervening along the same lines. Our 
concern, the communique continues, is that peace must be 
preserved and that the most appropriate international forum be 
found as soon as possible to ensure a peaceful solution to this 
dispute. Well, Charles, this is all I have concerning this 
diplomatic and military mission undertaken by France to 
Cameroon. In case of necessity, this mission will come to 
support the actions already undertaken, with much success, both 
by our soldiers and our diplomats. 
  [Announcer] Thank you, Joseph. Still, concerning this border 
conflict between Cameroon and its neighbor, Nigeria, the 
minister of defense visited with Cameroonian troops over the 
weekend. Accompanied by the chief of general staff, the minister 
visited the front to see the morale was of the Cameroonian 
troops. Their morale was judged to be good. The outcome of the 
latest clashes was one Cameroonian soldier killed, with more 
than 30 dead on the Nigerian side, according to our 
correspondent, [name indistinct] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The delegations of the Ndjamena Government and 
the National Awakening Committee for Peace and Democracy [CSNPD] 
started peace talks in Bangui this morning under the auspices of 
the Central African Republic [CAR]. The CAR agreed to assume 
this historic responsibility of peace broker at the request of 
Chadian President Idriss Deby. The talks are designed to 
restore peace in southern Chad. 
  To demonstrate the CAR Government's willingness to play its 
mediating role, Prime Minister Jean-Luc Mandaba made a point of 
personally presiding over the opening ceremony which was 
attended by the leaders of the two delegations and members of 
the president's office as well as cabinet members, officials 
from the prime minister's office, the judiciary, the National 
Assembly, and representatives of the CAR political parties. 
Speaking on this occasion, the prime minister stated that the 
time had come to silence arms and give priority to dialogue. He 
called for the setting up of a follow-up committee to monitor 
the implementation of any accords that will be reached during 
the roundtable talks. He pointed out that the CAR and the 
Chadian people were interested in seeing these negotiations 
yield positive results. 
  [Begin Mandaba recording] It is with much hope that, at your 
request, we have agreed to play the noble task of mediator 
between the government of President Deby and the delegation of 
the political-cum-military opposition movement based in southern 
Chad. The choice of the CAR was not made by chance since we 
share a long common border. We have always been a natural safe 
haven for our Chadian brothers. Our exchanges and relations in 
all sectors have been cordial and frank and our two countries 
have always resorted to dialogue in settling any border dispute 
in compliance with the OAU and UN principles and ideals. 
Chadian and CAR nationals have always worked hand in hand in 
their efforts to safeguard their common interests. [passage 
omitted] We hope that the two delegations did not come 
empty-handed and will not leave here empty-handed. That is why 
we strongly appeal to them to ensure that 1994 will be the year 
of peace, an indispensable factor for the much needed economic 
and political development of Chad. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]

  [Text] After three days of negotiations, nothing concrete 
has come out of the inter-Chadian peace talks under way in 
Bangui, Central African Republic. The Chadian Government and 
the National Awakening Committee for Peace and Democracy [CSNPD] 
have still not been able to settle their differences. Their 
talks have stalled on the issue of conditions laid down by Moise 
Kette's movement. Here is the reaction of Abderhamane 
Djasnabaille, spokesman of the committee for the defense of the 
national conference decisions, speaking to Jean-Claude Medome. 
  [Begin Djasnabaille recording] Concerning the ongoing talks 
between the CSNPD and the Chadian Government, we believe that 
the very issue they are discussing requires at least a national 
consensus. This impasse proves us right because the issue of 
organizing a referendum on the form of government is of interest 
to everybody, and I am not sure that the government can 
guarantee its organization since not everyone is involved. We 
must remember that this government is a transitional one and 
everything that is discussed must be based on consensus. 
  We have always generally said that a roundtable conference 
comprising all parties concerned must be held. We say that 
discussions must not be held with the CNSPD alone. They must 
include the Movement for Democracy and Development, the SNT 
[expansion unknown], and all other Chadian political and 
military organizations. 
  Furthermore, concerning the internal situation, we proposed 
the establishment of a national reconciliation committee to 
discuss this issue and to agree on a common stand that would 
effectively commit the government since it is a transitional 
one. It is not just a matter of discussing the principle. A 
program must be drawn up to indicate how long it will take to 
organize this referendum. 
  Meanwhile, today, nothing has been settled yet and this 
really shows the precariousness of the agreements that could be 
reached at these Bangui talks. [end recording]

  [Text] Talks in the Central African Republic between the 
Chadian Government and the opposition rebels of Moise Tchiete 
broke off yesterday without any spectacular breakthrough having 
been achieved. No firm cease-fire has yet been signed. The two 
parties have, however, agreed to meet again and keep their guns 
under wraps for the time being. The government side is 
relatively satisfied with the outcome. Earlier, Christophe 
Boisbouvier spoke to Abderamane Izzo, the leader of the 
government delegation in Bangui. In spite of the absence of a 
cease-fire, he does not expect fighting to flare up again in the 
south of the country. 
  [Begin recording] [Izzo] No, no, no. There will not be war. 
There will not be war for the simple reason that we have 
declared a unilateral cease-fire. On the other hand, there will 
not be war because, as everyone heard yesterday, the president 
of the CSNPD [Committee of National Revival for Peace and 
Democracy] solemnly declared that his troops would not attack 
the positions of the Chadian national army. 
  [Boisbouvier] There nevertheless remains a major stumbling 
block with the issue of the referendum on federalism demanded by 
the rebels and, it seems, rejected by you. 
  [Izza] Yes, listen, there is no way that having held just a 
meeting here in Bangui we can sign a document here with a 
minority, a tiny minority I would say, of the Chadian people on 
such an important issue. We expect them to examine their own 
consciences. [end recording] 
  As you heard, the question of federalism was not solved in 
Bangui. Moise Tchiete, the leader of the southern rebel 
movement, is nevertheless satisfied that the issue was discussed: 
  [Begin Tchiete recording] We are satisfied that the 
fundamental problems, which had always been fudged, were 
actually raised during these roundtable talks. I mean above all 
the problem of federalism. The fundamental problem in Chad is a 
above all a structural problem, a problem of cohabitation 
between the different groups that make up the Chadian 
population. You cannot forget the fact that we have been at war 
for 34 years, and we cannot carry on fighting like this. We are 
not closing the door to other groups, be they political, 
political-military, or other. We expect that these groups might 
also want to raise problems that are equally fundamental. [end 
recording]

  [Text] General Wadal Abdelkader Kamougue, the civil service 
and labor minister, returned to Ndjamena yesterday after a visit 
to Libya where he delivered a message from the head of state, 
Colonel Idriss Deby, to his Libyan counterpart, Colonel Mu'ammar 
al- Qadhdhafi. This message pertained to the International 
Court of Justice at the Hague's verdict on the Aozou Strip. 
Gen. Kamougue reviews his visit with Edouard Hela: 
  [Begin recording] [Kamougue] As announced by the media, I 
paid a visit in the company of Ali Mamane Sane, adviser on 
international and legal affairs at the Presidency, to the leader 
of the Libyan Revolution, Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, to whom I 
delivered a message from the Chadian head of state, Col. Idriss 
Deby. We were in the Libyan capital from 15 to 18 February. 
  The day after my arrival, I had the honor to be received by 
the Libyan head of state. Since the message I delivered was 
meant for the Libyan leader alone, it would not be normal for me 
to disclose its contents. However, it can be easily imagined 
that this message had something to do with the decision of the 
International Court of Justice which confirmed the demarcation 
of our border with Libya and consequently ruled that the Aozou 
Strip belongs to our country. In addition to delivering this 
message to the Libyan leader, I made a certain number of 
comments regarding an exchange of correspondence between the 
Libyan leader and the Chadian head of state. 
  In regard to the reaction of the Libyan authorities, we were 
received in two ways. Concerning the protocol reception, I must 
say that one was correct. Regarding the basic problem, Libya, 
through its most authoritative representative -- Col. Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi -- has accepted the court's decision. However, 
this country has not reacted officially and clearly either in a 
communique or in an official statement to the court decision. 
This difference between the words of the Libyan leader during 
our discussions and the absence of any official reaction 
concerning the court decision has confused us regarding our 
mission. The government is equally perplexed. 
  [Hela] Gen. Kamougue, before your visit to Libya there was a 
report on the concentration of troops on the borders of the two 
countries and on the maltreatment of Chadians in Libya. Did you 
discuss this with the Libyan authorities? 
  [Kamougue] Indeed, we discussed this issue which we can 
analyze in two parts. First, I will refer to the reinforcement 
of Libyan Army presence in the Aozou region. By the time we 
arrived in Libya, our government had received news of the troop 
reinforcement. However, the Libyan authorities we met denied 
these reports and even said that their military presence in the 
region was being reduced and that their planes had started 
returning to their base in northern Libya. Must these 
assurances given by the Libyan authorities be taken by the 
letter? Like Saint Thomas, we must see before we believe. 
Consequently, we are not satisfied with this statement by the 
Libyan authorities. Right now, we still have doubts and even 
fears and strong reserves regarding Libya's assurances in the 
absence of concrete proof that can effectively make us believe 
these statements. That is the first point. 
  On the second point regarding the maltreatment of Chadians 
in 
Libya, we were informed of this before our departure. We can 
now confirm that some Chadians were rounded up even a month 
before the International Court of Justice's verdict. A total of 
365 Chadians were rounded up in Tripoli, Seba, and Benghazi; 165 
were from Tripoli alone. The Chadians, according to the 
explanations given by the Libyan authorities, were in an 
irregular situation because they had no residence documents in 
conformity with Libyan legislation. During the audience with the 
Libyan leader we spoke about the issue and asked to visit our 
fellow countrymen. This was done on 18 February. After this 
visit, we asked the Libyan authorities to release the Chadians 
before the meeting of our two foreign ministers. This demand 
was accepted by the leader of the Libyan Revolution at the 
proposal of the Chadian head of state. 
  [Hela] Knowing the unpredictable nature of Col. al- 
Qadhdhafi, and in view of the obstacles being put up just after 
the International Court of Justice's verdict which was 
unfavorable to Libya, do you not fear that Libya will seek to 
destabilize Chad? 
  [Kamougue] I think we should not despair; one day relations 
between Libya and Chad will be normalized. We on our part have 
chosen the path of law and justice and, consequently, we have 
rejected a solution through the force of arms. We dare believe, 
and we greatly hope that the Libyan Government and people will 
also set out on this path of peace, which is absolutely 
necessary not only for Chad but also for Libya considering the 
current difficult situation we are all going through. We 
therefore believe that it is not in the Libyan people's interest 
to maintain any rebellion on our borders. What I also believe 
is that no Chadian, wherever he may be -- whether inside or 
outside Chad -- should allow himself to be manipulated by Libya 
to destabilize his country. We do not have any reason to fear 
any destabilization at the moment, and as I have just said, we 
are very vigilant. We appeal to all Chadians, wherever they are 
-- whether inside or outside the country -- to be alert to this 
fundamental issue: their nation's survival. [end recording]

  [Text] A meeting has been in progress since 1100. The 
meeting is between President Juvenal Habyarimana and the leaders 
of the five political parties participating in the current 
government, namely the Revolutionary National Movement for 
Democracy and Development [MRND], Republican Democratic Movement 
[MDR], Social Democratic Movement [PSD], Liberal Party [PL] and 
the Christian Democratic Party [PDC]. 
  The president said at the beginning of the meeting that the 
agenda consisted of two items. The first item was to see how 
the current government could function so that, pending the 
establishment of the transitional government, our country could 
be saved from slipping into anarchy, a process which has already 
started due to the current insecurity; to study ways of enabling 
the government to function efficiently, so as to halt our 
country's economic decline; and to study ways by which the 
current government could continue to function well, while 
continuing its consultations with the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] in implementing the peace accords. The second item on the 
agenda of the meeting between the president of the Republic and 
the representatives of the five parties participating in the 
government is to seek ways of immediately establishing 
broad-based transitional institutions. Here is what the 
president of the Republic had to say about the above issues: 
  [Begin Habyarimana recording] When I called this meeting, I 
had two things in mind. [Words indistinct] which are also of 
priority importance. But the first thing I see, as we have all 
noticed, is that the current government is not operational. 
Now, in the face of problems in the areas of security and the 
economy, we must look into ways of making the government 
operational, so that these problems can be resolved. 
  If we keep things as they are now, if we do not show the 
government how to function, people might turn against each 
other, [words indistinct] civil war, leading even to anarchy. 
That is the first thing I am concerned about: Our country 
should not slip into anarchy. 
  The second thing is that leadership institutions must be 
established, namely, the transitional National Assembly and the 
broad-based transitional government. Now, why have they not yet 
been put in place? How can we speed up the process? This is 
another thing we can study. 
  Some have asked why we did not invite the RPF to this 
meeting. As far as I am concerned, the work of the current 
government does not concern the RPF at all. It concerns the 
parties which formed the government. There are two sides which 
are party to the peace agreement, the government and the RPF. 
When our problems are solved....[pauses] You see, if you ask 
the RPF why things are not making any progress, they answer: We 
do not have any problems. The problem is with the government 
side. So you people who formed the government are the ones who 
should study the problems of the government side and try to find 
solutions. [passage indistinct] 
  Once the government's problems have been solved and it feels 
that the remaining institutions can be set up swiftly, then we 
will call the RPF and tell them that the problems that existed 
on the government side have been solved, so come along so that 
we can establish....[pauses] Otherwise, if you call them, they 
have their proposals and they put them forward, but the 
government side does not have proposals [words indistinct]. So 
let us look for proposals, [words indistinct] on the government 
side. Once we have them, [words indistinct], even tomorrow, 
although I have another program for tomorrow, then on Sunday [27 
February], maybe if we schedule it for the afternoon, although 
you might say Habyarimana is putting pressure on us. I will do 
what you decide upon, but do not say that I am putting pressure 
on you after I have agreed on matters with you. What is needed 
is to see how the current government can solve the existing 
problems, and that is why I (?invited) the prime minister, who 
heads the government pending the establishment of these 
institutions, although we want them set up swiftly but only 
after settling the problems facing the government. [end 
recording] 
  It is worth noting that the meeting was attended by both 
prime ministers, that of the current transitional government, 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and that of the broad-based transitional 
government, Faustin Twagiramungu; representatives of the MRND, 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Edouard Karemera, Ferdinand Kabagema and 
Joseph Nzirorera; representatives from the MDR party included 
Dismas Nsengiyaremye, Frodwald Karamira and Donat Murego; the 
PDC was represented by Jean-Nepomucene, [name indistinct] and 
(Theobald Rwasa); the PL was represented by Justin Mugenzi, 
Landwald Ndasingwa, Stanislas Mbonampeka and Agnes Ntamabyaliro; 
for PSD there was Frederic Nzamurambaho, Felicien Ngango, 
Theoneste Gafaranga, and Emerance Mutuyimana; on the side of the 
presidency of the Republic there was Enock Ruhigira and Juvenal 
Renzaho. We have just learned that the meeting has ended. We 
will give you a report on it in our 2100 news bulletin tonight.

  [Text] Yesterday, the president of the republic, Major 
General Juvenal Habyarimana, traveled to Gbadolite in Zaire. 
While there he met his Zairean counterpart, Marshal Mobutu Sese 
Seko, and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi. The three heads of 
state exchanged views on ways of reviving the Economic Community 
of the Great Lakes Countries [CEPGL] so that the community could 
achieve its objectives. 
  They also talked about the crucial problems facing our three 
countries. Presidents Habyarimana and Mobutu took the 
opportunity to tell the new Burundi president, Cyprien 
Ntaryamira, that they were happy with his nomination as the 
president of Burundi. They wished him success in his new duties 
and guaranteed him their support.

  [Text] General Muhammad Farah Aidid, the leader of a 
Somalian opposition group, met President Isayas Afewerki after 
arriving in Asmara today. The main objective of his visit to 
Eritrea is to discuss issues affecting Somalia and the Horn of 
Africa. He was met on arrival at Asmara International Airport 
by Foreign Minister Muhammad Sharifo and Mr. Girma Asmerom, the 
head of the Africa desk at the Foreign Ministry. 
  General Farah Aidid extensively discussed with President 
Isayas Afewerki issues affecting Somalia and the Horn of Africa, 
noting that the security situation in Somalia was improving and 
stabilizing, and that the various political organizations were 
reconciling and engaging in dialogue. Having stated that the 
Somali people could solve their own problems without the 
intervention of foreign (?forces), he noted that the efforts of 
President Meles and other East African leaders to solve 
Somalia's problem were the best and most appropriate. The 
efforts of President Isayas and the state of Eritrea to solve 
Somalia's problem were highly appreciated by the Somali people. 
  For his part, President Isayas noted that the Eritrean 
Government believed that Somalia's problem could only be solved 
by the Somalis themselves, and that it opposed foreign 
intervention.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 26 Feb (MENA)--Mohamed Abshir, leader of 
the Democratic Front for the Salvation of Somalia, has said that 
Egypt under the leadership of President Husni Mubarak plays an 
active role in helping Somalia to achieve national 
reconciliation, restore peace, and establish a provisional 
government. He expressed his hope that Egypt will continue its 
support for the Somali nation because it will pass through a 
critical stage in the future after the U.S. and European forces 
have withdrawn on 21 March. [passage omitted] 
  He addressed a message to General Aidid in which he said 
that 
the various factions welcome his participation in the Cairo 
meeting and his participation in the dialogue under the auspices 
of President Mubarak. Abshir also expressed the factions' 
willingness to forget the past and cooperate with him for the 
sake of the Somali people interest to restore stability, 
establish a central authority, help Somalia restore its 
credibility, and renounce violence to find a peaceful and 
Islamic solution. 
  He stressed the need for Aidid to take this historic 
opportunity, face the challenge, and prove to the world that the 
Somalis can rearrange the house from within. He noted that the 
main obstacle to the implementation of the Addis Ababa Accord 
lies in the stance of General Aidid himself. Aidid, he said, 
claims that he controls most of the Somali local and regional 
councils and administrations, although he does not enjoy a 
popular consensus and does not form a majority at all. 
  He said the Somali problem now centers on personal interests 
and a power struggle. He added that Aidid's group, which 
consists of only three of the 15 factions, have killed 
approximately 400,000 Somalis either by fire or by preventing 
food aid from reaching the needy over the last three years. 
  On charges that the United Nations caused the war in 
Somalia, 
Abshir said the international organization has exerted effective 
efforts to find a solution to the Somali problem and provided 
humanitarian and food aid. He noted that it is General Aidid 
who is responsible for disseminating these accusations in which 
Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan support him. Sudan, he said, fears 
that the U.S. forces may move into south Sudan from the Somali 
territories. Sudan has invited General Aidid and granted him 
about a half million dollars to support the tribal war in 
Somalia. 
  Abshir noted the need for the presence of Arab forces to 
rebuild Somalia and set up a police force to confront these 
problems and control the arms of the warring factions.

  [Text] Kampala, Feb 25 (AFP) -- Rebels calling themselves 
members of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) overrun a dispensary 
on the Gulu-Kitgum road in northern Uganda on Friday [25 
February] and looted all the medical supplies, Ugandan police 
said here on Friday. 
  "We have heard of it but we do not have details", a police 
spokesman told AFP on telephone. 
  Police said that the rebels, estimated at 20, attacked the 
dispensary, taking patients and medical staff unaware, fired in 
the air to disperse patients and medical personnel and then 
looted all drugs available. 
  The attack was the latest on civilian targets by the rebels, 
who have defied an ultimatum by President Yoweri Museveni on 
February 13 to surrender. 
  On the day the ultimatum was supposed to expire -- February 
20 -- the rebels led by Joseph Kony, a man in his late twenties, 
attacked an army unit at Tegot-Pawel, 50 kilometers (30 miles) 
north of Gulu town, during which four army soldiers and 14 
rebels were reported killed. 
  On Monday the rebels ambushed a police vehicle near Ayugi 
river, 11 kms (seven miles) along the Atiak-Moyo road in 
northwest Uganda, killing 11 people, including two soldiers.

  [Text] We learned yesterday that Colonel Saloum Bilal, a 
Popular Movement of the Azaouad military leader, died on 25 
February following an attack by armed bandits in an area 100 km 
from Gao. Alpha Mengar, our permanent correspondent in Poure, 
has the details. 
  [Mengar] Rumors on the colonel's death spread all over Gao. 
While people were having tea in front of shops after prayers, 
the story on everyone's lips was that Col. Bilal had been 
attacked and that he was dead. 
  It must be said that Col. Bilal is, above all, seen as one 
of 
the architects of the peace process which was embarked upon 
following the signing of the National Pact on 11 April 1992. He 
had survived several ambushes in the past. One person died in 
this recent attack and one was seriously wounded. A third was 
abducted by the attackers, and a fourth escaped. 
  A reliable source close to the cease-fire monitoring 
committee stated: All we can say is that Bilal died following 
an attack by an unidentified number of armed bandits in a 
vehicle. Following the signing of the National Pact, Saloum 
Bilal married Bintu Shadeya, first runner-up in the Sike-Askia 
beauty competition.

  [Text] The chief of Army staff [as heard], Major General 
Chris Alli, has assured Nigerians that the Nigerian Army is in 
good shape to defend the territorial integrity of the nation. 
Correspondent Tunde Odunkorude reports that the Army chief, who 
spoke to newsmen in Fanda in Ondo state, explained the presence 
of Nigerian troops at the Bakassi Peninsula in Cross River State: 
  [Begin recording] [Odunkorude] Maj. Gen. Chris Alli told the 
newsmen that the country has no intention to go to war with any 
of our neighbors. 
  [Alli] Well, I do not know what you mean by position, but we 
are in our territory in Bakassi and that is just what we are 
doing, protecting our citizens. (?Our people) have been fired 
at occasionally by the gendarmes, but we are restraining 
ourselves. I would not talk about aggression between two 
brothers, would I? 
  [Odunkorude] The chief of Army staff was in the state to 
inspect officers in the ranks of lieutenants drawn from all Army 
formations in the country, who are undergoing practical 
examinations to the rank of captain. Gen. Alli urged them to 
place more emphasis on their military assignments and noted that 
their individual contributions to the development of the Army 
will go a long way in solidifying the foundation put in place by 
the founding fathers of the Army. Speaking during a courtesy 
call on Alayi of Ekon Alayi, Gen. Alli said the Army is training 
and retraining its officers and men to keep them in constant 
readiness for the protection of the nation's territorial 
integrity. The Alayi Oba Emmanuel Aladujari noted the need for 
the country to remain one in line with the principles of our 
founding fathers. [end recording]

  [Text] Let us begin this newscast with a clarification from 
the government. The National Electoral Commission [CEN] has 
announced the partial results for the 19 constituencies where 
the 20 February elections took place. However, it was of the 
view that it was not in a position to announce the results for 
the five remaining constituencies, where serious incidents 
disrupted the smooth running of the electoral exercise. The CEN 
has, therefore, submitted the dossier to the Supreme Court. 
  The government has no intention of interfering in the 
settlement of the election disputes. It hopes that the 
competent organs, which are provided by the Constitution and the 
Electoral Law to settle electoral disputes, will be able to make 
their decisions with full sovereignty -- and without any 
pressure. It will do everything in its power to facilitate the 
establishment of the institutions of the Fourth Republic with 
peace and security for all. 
  Finally, the government hopes that everyone will respect the

of the countries serving on the Internatonal Follow Up Committee.

  [Text] Abidjan, Feb 27 (AFP)--The Togolese Government 
Sunday [27 February] indirectly criticised France, Germany and 
the United States for putting "pressure" on it to publish full 
results of Togo's first multi-party elections and to respect the 
outcome. 
  In a statement sent to AFP here, the government called for 
the Togolese Supreme Court to be allowed to determine the 
results of last Sunday's second round of polling "completely 
independently, without any pressure." 
  After the National Electoral Commission on Wednesday refused 
to publish the full count, Commission president Garba Sipohon 
acknowledged all the votes had been counted but said the results 
would be sent to the Supreme Court "for evaluation." 
  The court has until March 13 to decide the outcome; however 
a 
new parliament is due to be installed by Tuesday. 
  Two opposition parties, Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) 
and Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), claimed they won 43 of 
the 81 seats. 
  Under the constitution, an absolute majority would entitle 
them to form a new government. 
  The Commission, for its part, proclaimed only 76 deputies 
"provisionally elected": 33 from CAR, 5 from UTD, 35 from 
Togolese People's Rally (RPT, which backs President Gnassingbe 
Eyadema who has ruled Togo since 1967), 2 from the pro-Eyadema 
Union for Justice and Democracy (UJD), and one Centrist. 
  It failed to confirm the election of three CAR candidates 
and 
2 UTD candidates in constituencies where RPT alleged 
irregularities took place. 
  Unless the row is settled by Tuesday, only 76 deputies will 
take their seats in the new parliament. 
  Meanwhile the RPT has claimed to be the leading party in the 
future parliament, based on the "provisional" results, and 
called for "its just due in the future government." 
  The government in its statement Sunday called for the 
constitution and electoral code to be respected "as is the 
tradition in each of the states represented in the international 
committee" monitoring the elections. 
  Officials from Burkina Faso, Egypt, France, Germany and the 
United States sit on this panel. 
  France, Germany and the United States have said the 
elections 
were generally free and fair despite some irregularities and 
violence. All have called on the Lome government to respect the 
results.

  [Text] The Togolese must show a lot of patience in order to 
discover the final results of the second round of legislative 
elections. The U.S. secretary of state has expressed his 
impatience concerning the democratic process in Togo, which is 
dragging its feet. Here is the reaction of Edem Kodjo, from the 
Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], on this issue: 
  [Begin recording] [Kodjo] Eight parties are contesting how 
things are progressing. The eight parties feel that the 
National Electoral Commission has shirked its responsibility, 
because whatever the case, it was its responsibility to publish 
the results, and then let those who are not happy with the 
results resort to the Supreme Court for redress. But one cannot 
contest results that have not been published. We feel that 
these results should have been published. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] At the end of the second round 
of the elections, and after the publication of results in 19 
constituencies, the UTD, your party, won only five seats, and 
according to some sources, the UTD is reported to be closer to 
the Togolese People's Rally [RPT]. What do you say to that? 
  [Kodjo] This sheer nonsense! How can a party which has 
proven its worth among the democratic ranks suddenly swing to 
the other side? What interest do we have in doing that? I must 
tell you that this is only loose talk on the part of some 
people, and has no effect on the public. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The specific principles on national reconciliation 
are still under discussion. The negotiators met only this 
morning to look at a new version of the third document 
consisting of 16 principles, of which about 60 per cent has been 
dealt with. The principles cover administrative 
decentralization, autonomy of provincial governments, the 
national anthem, and the republic's symbols, immunity, and the 
acquisition of diplomatic passports by National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] officials, as well as war 
crimes and the pardoning of individual action during the course 
of the war. All these issues have already been dealt with. 
  Tomorrow, the mediator will submit a new document to the two 
sides. A plenary session will be held on 28 February, during 
which UNITA's role in central and provincial governments, the 
Constitution of the Republic, the news media, the status to be 
accorded to Jonas Savimbi, the return of UNITA property, and 
UNITA's role in economically strategic enterprises will be 
discussed. Legal issues will continue to be raised with UNITA 
demanding a more open debate on institutional structures. The 
government only agrees to negotiate within the law, noting that 
the Lusaka peace talks cannot interfere with national 
sovereignty. 
  Meanwhile, Chief Beye [words indistinct] media coverage. 
Over the past days threats were made about investigations into 
information leaks. It has been reported that the UN secretary 
general's special representative suggested that journalists 
should be expelled. It seems that Chief Beye wants to raise the 
flag of peace and therefore take Angolans by surprise. If that 
is the case, than let it happen right away.

  [Text] Angolan Government and UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] delegations at the Lusaka peace 
talks met this evening to try and overcome the differences 
preventing an agreement on the specific principles for national 
reconciliation. 
  A source at the talks said that the meeting is being held as 
a response to a request by the observers who hope that one 
week-old differences will be overcome and hope that the two 
sides will approve specific principles for national 
reconciliation tomorrow. One of the points of disagreement that 
is being discussed at the meeting relates to UNITA's radio 
station the Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel, also 
known as VORGAN. According to Angolan legislation, political 
parties can own publications but cannot own radio stations. 
Meanwhile, UNITA considers VORGAN an exception because it 
already existed before the legislation was approved. 
  Another point of disagreement relates to the country's 
administrative decentralization, which the government says is 
already being implemented. Meanwhile, UNITA wants provincial 
government to have its own power, at several levels, as well as 
its own budgetary capacities. Moreover, UNITA wants the 
principle relating to holding provincial and locals elections to 
be defined in Lusaka, following a transitional period.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by President Jose Eduardo dos </F>
Santos with unidentified correspondents in Paris on 25 February] 
  [Text] At a news conference in Paris yesterday, Angolan 
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said his visit to France had 
had a positive outcome. 
  [Begin Santos recording] I would like to express my 
gratitude 
for the warm reception my team and I have been given. Our visit 
is in keeping with the excellent relations of friendship and 
cooperation our countries enjoy. This time, we have taken 
advantage of our stay in France to discuss bilateral relations 
and certain specific issues, notably those pertaining to the 
Angolan peace talks and economic relations. This means that we 
are leaving France quite happy with the positive results we have 
achieved. (?It is natural) that journalists should try to learn 
whether the arms embargo issue was raised and whether Angola 
asked for French military support. I shall tell you immediately 
that we did not do so. We came here principally to discuss 
bilateral relations, issues relating to economic cooperation, 
and how France could intervene indirectly in southern and 
central Africa to help create a climate that will favor 
negotiation and permit the successful implementation of an 
eventual accord between the government and the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, in Lusaka. 
  I was also privileged to receive distinguished French 
figures 
-- notably businessmen -- in my apartment. I am talking about 
the chairmen of Total, Elf Aquitaine, and Aerospatiale 
companies, all of which have special relations with Angola, 
because they have mutually advantageous relations with Angolan 
companies. In general terms, I can say that the representatives 
of those companies have felt comfortable in our country and have 
enjoyed our hospitality, which has allowed them to live and 
operate in relative stability despite the war. I took advantage 
of my contacts with French Government officials and with the 
chairmen of commercial companies to explain the guidelines of 
the Economic Stabilization Program that the Angolan Government 
now plans to implement. They saw that it is the Angolan 
Government's desire to create the necessary macroeconomic and 
security conditions that will permit stabler economic activity, 
thereby allowing French cooperation in developing the Angolan 
economy. 
  The Angolan foreign debt issue also received particular 
attention during our visit. We discussed it with the French 
authorities, but not so much in terms of rescheduling or paying 
it. Rather, we asked France to use its influence with 
international organizations in general, and with the IMF in 
particular, to [words indistinct] such an agreement would allow 
our country and its creditors in the Paris Club to analyze and 
discuss a plan to have Angola's foreign debt rescheduled. 
  I am aware that you, the journalists, tried to report on the 
situation in Angola, the work being done by my government, and 
bilateral relations during my stay in France. I must tell you 
that we were disappointed to see that reporting on my country 
and on my government's work was, in many instances, quite 
distorted. Be that as it may, we have not come here to issue 
any formal denial. We want to satisfy the curiosity of the 
reporters present here. Nonetheless, I must tell you that many 
of the reports were unfounded. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Eduardo dos Santos, president of the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-LP, left 
the French capital this morning for Morocco, where he is 
scheduled to meet King Hassan II in Rabat. They will discuss 
King Hassan II's peace proposal for Angola. 
  Meanwhile, diplomatic sources have said that Jose Eduardo 
dos 
Santos is disappointed with Angolan Ambassador to France 
Boaventura Cardoso's work. Ambassador Cardoso had prepared the 
Futungo de Belas Palace chieftain's visit to France. The 
MPLA-PT leader is also unhappy about a less than truthful report 
produced by Foreign Affairs Minister Venancio de Moura 
suggesting improved bilateral relations. The general opinion is 
that MPLA-PT leader's three-day visit to France was a thorough 
fiasco. 
  French President Francois Mitterrand took a firm position 
and 
made it clear that his country did not wish to compromise the 
Lusaka peace talks in any way. The government led by Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur supported President Francois 
Mitterrand's positions. [passage omitted] 
  Using his constitutional powers, French President Mitterrand 
yesterday warned Acting President Eduardo dos Santos that France 
only supports a negotiated settlement to the Angolan crisis. 
The upshot is that Engineer Eduardo dos Santos will be 
returning home quite disappointed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
returned from Paris this afternoon after a four-day visit to 
France. He was welcomed at the 4 February International Airport 
by the president of the National Assembly and government 
members. His visit to France dealt mainly with political issues 
and bilateral cooperation. Observers say the visit went 
according to plan. The Angolan head of state held talks with 
Paris Club officials and Elf Aquitaine directors with whom he 
discussed economic issues. Angolan First Lady Ana Paula dos 
Santos accompanied the head of state on his return trip.

  [Excerpt] Acting President Eduardo dos Santos wound up his 
visit to the French capital yesterday. He had arrived in Paris 
on 23 February and, according to diplomatic sources, the three 
days of his visit translated into a resounding failure. The 
Futungo de Belas Palace chieftain did not come anywhere near 
achieving the goals he had set for himself on this trip, because 
the French Government is rather reluctant to provide economic 
and military aid to Luanda. 
  In what must have been a major shock to the strongman at 
Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace, the French authorities said 
that everyone is waiting for the outcome of the Lusaka talks. 
It is worth noting that Eduardo dos Santos was granted an 
audience by French President Francois Mitterrand yesterday. The 
unelected president of Angola is now packing his bags and will 
be returning to Luanda today, after his visit turned out to be a 
complete failure and he found that many people in the French 
capital contested his regime. Angolan, French, and Italian 
citizens gathered to demonstrate against his presence in the 
fatherland of Charles de Gaulle. Those people, who are the 
friends of Angola and of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola, UNITA, unreservedly asked for an end to 
the carnage that Eduardo dos Santos has been masterminding in 
this country. They carried placards and shouted the following 
slogans: We want Angola to be free of massacres by the Riot 
Police! Dos Santos, free the thousands of political prisoners 
you are still holding! Return the bodies of the UNITA peace 
negotiators who were murdered in Luanda! 
  That demonstration, which took place in front of Luanda's 
embassy in the French capital, received direct support from a 
number of French parties that maintain friendly relations with 
UNITA. 
  Observers have made it clear that the Futungo de Belas 
Palace 
chieftain's visit to Paris was both premature and poorly 
planned. No head of state has ever been as humiliated in Europe 
as Eduardo dos Santos was in his visit to France. Luanda's 
strongman failed miserably and was unable to achieve his goals. 
The government led by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was very 
rigorous, stuck to its promises, and did not allow the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party to buy any 
weapons or combat helicopters. The team led by Eduardo dos 
Santos had already been preparing to engage in such talks. 
  The Futungo de Belas chieftain was not received by powerful 
Defense Minister Francois Leotard or by the mayor of the city of 
Paris, a very important figure in the European Community. 
Moreover, the French media covered only very sparsely the 
Luanda chieftain's visit, which wound up yesterday. The few 
newspapers that have reported on the visit have noted that the 
government led by Eduardo dos Santos has remained insensitive to 
the Angolan people's suffering. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Antonio Jamba Conomuissa, party secretary for Negola 
Commune, says civilians have been murdered and tortured. 
Conomuissa said this week fighter bombers from Lubango attacked 
the villages of Ucua, Canopa, Vila Branca, and Cucesse, killing 
50 civilians. Most of the victims were elderly people and 
children. Conomuissa said the enemy abducted 57 civilians from 
(Sicocosse), Cambiri, and Capeua. The civilians were killed and 
their corpses abandoned on the road. Those who escaped from the 
attacks were killed in explosions caused by land mines that Joao 
de Matos' men planted in roads leading to farms. The situation 
is worrying the residents of those areas.

<F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>
  [Text] New tactical military moves are under way in Angola. 
Government military sources report major troop and military 
equipment movements by the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuito and other parts of the 
country. Reginaldo Silva, the BBC correspondent in Luanda, 
reports: 
  [Begin Silva recording] Government sources today reiterated 
their accusation that UNITA is preparing a major attack on the 
city of Cuito. They expect such an attack to occur soon and 
their views seem to be backed by the media in Luanda, notably 
IMPARCIAL FAX, the most recent independent publication to have 
emerged in the Angolan capital. (?According to that) source, 
UNITA is strengthening all its positions in the area of Cuito. 
It has been providing logistical supplies to its forces in the 
area of Chitundo, some 15 km from Cuito. UNITA troops have been 
seen moving from Cuanza Commune and heading in the direction of 
the outskirts of Cuito. ZU- 23 artillery weapons have been set 
up at the local hospital and at a temporary school. Another two 
long-range artillery weapons are reported to have been set up 
north of Chambanda Village. UNITA's (?L-50) Battalion is also 
reported to have been moving from Andulo District to positions 
near the hospital area in Cuito's Cantinflas Ward. 
  In Cuito, an alleged UNITA soldier by the name of Antonio 
Domingos was today presented to the public. He is said to have 
recently deserted from the UNITA ranks and his statements 
confirmed that UNITA troops have been moving in the vicinity of 
the capital of Bie Province. 
  The Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, chief of General Staff has 
also issued a communique reporting constant ambushes by the 
UNITA forces. That communique adds that UNITA has been planting 
mines in the roads to Malange, Saurimo, Lucapa, Dundo, Ambriz, 
Caxito, and Dondo. It confirms that UNITA attacked Cunge 
Commune, 7 km from Cuito, on 23 February, and lost more than 30 
men. What seems to be of greater concern to the government 
forces at this stage is the presence of UNITA troops along the 
road linking Luanda and Porto Amboim. That was one of the few 
roads where there were no reports of military activity. That 
road is used for many people and goods to travel between Cuanza 
Sul and Luanda Provinces. It is noteworthy that a large 
percentage of Angolan-made food products currently reaching 
Luanda come from Cuanza Sul Province. 
  UNITA sources have kept their silence concerning those 
developments. Today, they only provided detailed reports about 
government military operations against their positions in Huila 
Province and the government's continuing recruitment of South 
African mercenaries. Those men are said to be assembling at the 
coastal town of Cabo Ledo, slightly more than 100 km south of 
Luanda. [end recording]

  [Text] The new winds of democracy blowing over our 
continent represent a historic opportunity. That was said by 
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings when he stopped over in Luanda 
this morning on his way to Namibia. He was welcomed by National 
Assembly Chairman Franca van Dunem, government members, and 
officials of the Ghanaian Embassy in Angola. 
  [Begin Rawlings recording, in English fading into Portuguese 
translation] I realize the Angolan war has been provoked by the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
The winds of democracy blowing over our continent represent a 
historic opportunity not only to individual countries, but to 
all of them. We ought to do away with ethnic differences because 
they create problems, not to the better off, but to the 
underprivileged. I think it would be good if we could take this 
magnificent opportunity to establish democracy in Africa. We 
have no other option. This is our continent and we ought to 
work together. [end recording] 
  President Rawlings then left for Namibia.

doctors said they came to Malawi to check the president's 
condition since the (?past) treatment. The doctors said they 
were greatly impressed due to the president's physical recovery 
and that they found him in good condition, which means the 
president was in good health and was continuing to make good 
progress. They said that this was contrary to the speculations 
that were going on in the South African press that the president 
was critically ill. They said they were going back to South 
Africa very happy and there are no complications and no 
infections of any kind with the president's condition.

  [Text] South Africa and Namibia have signed an agreement to 
facilitate the easier administration of justice between the two 
countries and have expressed hopes for increasing regional legal 
cooperation. Signed in Walvis Bay by the South African justice 
minister, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, and his Namibian counterpart, Mr. 
Ngarikutuke Tjiriange, the agreement was the first of its kind 
between South Africa and a neighboring state. It creates the 
legal scope for enforcement of maintenance orders, civil 
judgments, and cross border subpoenas, and criminal court 
orders. The two governments also agreed to investigate 
reciprocal legislation to better facilitate searches and seizure 
of illegal goods.

  [Text] There is no longer any delay relating to troop 
confinement in Mozambique. According to a report released by 
Unomoz [UN Operations in Mozambique] today, half the government 
and Renamo regulars, are already in confinement centers. The 
United Nations representation is now waiting for demobilization 
to start on Tuesday [1 March], as scheduled. But Renamo has not 
yet handed in the list of its soldiers to be demobilized and to 
avoid delays, UN representative Aldo Ajello is proposing that 
the government should take the first step. The proposal has 
been totally rejected. In statements this evening to RDP, the 
Armed Forces chief of staff recalled that such a measure would 
infringe the Rome peace agreement: 
  [Begin recording] [General Antonio Hama Thai] That is 
incorrect, that is not what is contained in the agreement, that 
is not what we agreed with Renamo. I would like to say this is 
my personal view -- we did not agree that, we did not sign that, 
we do not have any problems with Renamo. The agreement does not 
say that. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] As far as you are concerned, 
the 
government should not demobilize before Renamo does so? 
  [Thai] Of course, it has to be simultaneous, that is what is 
contained in the agreement. Because the agreement, the 
agreement means that there are signatories. As for this new 
story telling people to demobilize, it is a bad one. [end 
recording] 
  That was General Antonio Hama Thai, the Mozambican Army 
chief 
of staff. The Mozambican Government rejects a two-speed 
demobilization.

  [Text] In a report distributed to the media today, the 
United Nations recognizes that in some areas of the country the 
UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] personnel have been 
promoting prostitution. The document states that although 
prostitution was obvious in the society even before the arrival 
of Unomoz personnel, with the arrival of thousands of soldiers 
in the country within the framework of the peace process, this 
phenomenon increased from that period. The report states that 
this increase is also due to the fact that the Unomoz personnel 
are earning more than Mozambican citizens, hence they are 
attractive to minors, who involve themselves in prostitution. 
  [Begin Deputy UN Special Representative recording in 
English] 
It has been suggested that some Mozambican cities, where the 
incidence of Unomoz members involved with prostitutes was found 
to be greatest, have been regional centers of prostitution in 
successive periods during which foreign troops were present 
there. In those places, prostitution, including minors selling 
sex, has long been a feature of urban life. In addition, many 
observers agreed that patrons of the sex trade in Mozambique are 
not limited to Unomoz personnel. Nevertheless, it is evident 
that some Unomoz personnel stationed in some locations in 
Mozambique have indeed patronized prostitutes and that 
prostitution in those places has increased perceptibly since the 
arrival of Unomoz in large numbers. This increase in 
prostitution has negatively affected the quality of urban public 
life, and apparently in some instances generated some 
ill-feeling toward Unomoz personnel in some areas. It is also 
evident that some Unomoz personnel patronizing prostitutes 
sought the services of prostitutes thought by them to be minors. 
Now, the investigating team found that patronage of 
prostitutes, among them minors, by some Unomoz personnel 
occurred despite existing codes of discipline and the explicit 
instructions given to many members of the Unomoz to avoid all 
illegal sexual liaison with Mozambican women. [end recording]

  [Text] Mozambican Foreign Minister Dr. Pascoal Mocumbi has 
warned that his government is considering using force to remove 
members of the Malawian paramilitary body, the Young Pioneers, 
who have crossed illegally into Mozambique last December. Dr. 
Mocumbi said his government will ask the Supervisory and Control 
Commission, the body in charge of implementing the peace 
agreement between the Mozambican Government and Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance], to become involved. This is 
because the government would need to use troops to bring the 
Young Pioneers under control, but under the terms of the peace 
agreement with Renamo, any such troop movements must be approved 
by the commission.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Salome Moiane has 
said that the Mozambican Government is to react officially to 
South Africa's threat to electrify the border with Mozambique 
once again. On 20 February, South African Police officials 
distributed pamphlets in Ressano Garcia town, in Maputo 
Province, saying that the common border would be electrified 
once again to reduce border violations by Mozambican citizens. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Moiane has told the DOMINGO 
newspaper 
that some reports say those pamphlets were dropped from a small 
aircraft, which may have violated Mozambican air space. 
  The Mozambican deputy foreign minister is currently in 
Windhoek, the Namibian capital, to represent the Mozambican 
Government in the ceremony that will see Walvis Bay Harbor 
returned to Namibia.

  [Text] Zimbabwe's foreign affairs minister says plans by a 
United States organization to help fund the political opposition 
in Zimbabwe amounts to subversive interference in the country's 
internal affairs. In an interview published in Harare, Dr. 
Nathan Shamuyarira said the International Republican Institute 
was funded by security agents of big powers. The Zimbabwean 
Government strongly regretted the plan to help the opposition. 
He said it was tantamount to interference in the internal 
affairs of Zimbabwe. Dr. Shamuyarira said there was a danger 
that the American funding could lead to subversion. Zimbabwean 
opposition parties should fund themselves locally. He said the 
money they received from the international organizations was 
dirty money.

  [Text] Harare, Feb 26 (AFP) -- Ethiopia has formally asked 
Zimbabwe to extradite former dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, so 
he can be tried for crimes committed during his 17-year reign. 
  Ethiopian ambassador to Zimbabwe, Fantahum Michael, told AFP 
Saturday [26 February] that he personally presented the request 
to Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira on Wednesday. 
  He said Shamuyarira told him he would present the request to 
the cabinet and a response could be expected at a later date. 
  The Zimbabwean authorities have not yet responded publicly 
to 
the request. 
  Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe just before a 1991 uprising in his 
country and was granted political asylum by President Robert 
Mugabe, a former ally, in May 1991. 
  Early this month, Mengistu breached one of his conditions of 
asylum, and broke years of silence over his home country saying 
Ethiopia was in a "disgusting" state and that he had plans to 
rescue it. 
  Michael, however said the extradition request was not 
sparked 
off by Mengistu's recent outburst. 
  He said it was a coincidence as preparations had already 
been 
underway to ask for his extradition. 
  The request was finalised in Addis Ababa on February 15 and 
brought to Harare this week by a team of European lawyers 
helping the government of Meles Zenawi investigate Mengistu's 
human rights violations together with some members of the office 
of the special prosecutor of Ethiopia. 
  The request documents detail Mengistu's abuse of human 
rights, which included the massacre of at least 100,000 
Ethiopians. 
  Analysts say it is likely to take months before Zimbabwe 
answers to the request as it will take legal experts from both 
countries, as well as international agencies to meet and examine 
the various points of international law under which the 
extradition and trial should take place. 
  The DAILY GAZETTE newspaper said Saturday that the Ethiopian 
Government was also seeking the extradition of Mengistu's aides, 
24 of whom were in Kenya, 14 in the United States, six in Europe 
and several others in other African nations. 
  Three of the wanted aides are reportedly holed up in the 
Italian Embassy in Addis Ababa and many others are already in 
Ethiopian Government custody.

<F P=106> [From the "Newsbrief" program] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha met with Zulu 
King Goodwill Zwelithini and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi last 
night to discuss the deadlock in negotiations. Michelle Vermaak 
asked Mr. Botha whether any progress had been made in resolving 
the impasse. 
  [Begin recording] [Botha] I would first of all wish to make 
it clear, this was an informal meeting, no agenda, just a 
discussion -- informally, openly, as South Africans. So I would 
not wish to proceed from a point where the purpose was to make 
progress in any way. The purpose was to discuss, to analyze, to 
be completely open with one another and that is what we did. 
  [Vermaak] Do you think that any solutions, anything positive 
then came out in the meeting? 
  [Botha] That will depend on decisions taken today and in the 
days that come. I reported fully to the president in Cape Town 
and to my colleagues, Minister Roelf Meyer and Minister Danie 
Schutte, and the one thing that came out very clearly was a 
deep-rooted desire on the part of His Majesty the king, to have 
the position and status of the Zulu kingdom preserved and 
guaranteed and secured. That to the king is a very important, if 
not nonnegotiable position, because his reasoning is that the 
Zulu kingdom was functioning long before the British came to 
Natal or long before the Union of South Africa came into being 
in 1910, or the Republic of South Africa subsequently, and their 
reasoning is that the Zulus, the king, being a monarch, 
recognized worldwide -- in years to come -- that they had not 
been consulted. 
  [Vermaak] Do you think that the government and the ANC 
[African National Congress] are moving closer to the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] and that a possible solution will be 
found before the elections? 
  [Botha] I personally believe that a distinction must be made 
between the status and the position of the kingdom of KwaZulu, 
and political activities or elections, and participation in 
elections, and I think we ought not to confuse the two, or 
rather, see the one directly related to the other. The king or 
the kingdom ought to be above politics and elections and should 
not be subject, in my opinion, to political decisions in which 
the king has no power, but if something could be agreed on or 
something could be done urgently in the next day, or two, or 
three, to put the position of the kingdom of KwaZulu beyond any 
doubt -- no tampering with it -- I think if something could be 
done in this direction then there is a good possibility that all 
the other outstanding matters which trouble Dr. Buthelezi and 
Inkatha, I think they could then be resolved. [end recording]

  [Text] Bisho Feb 27 SAPA -- African National Congress [ANC] 
leader Nelson Mandela said on Sunday [27 February] he was 
prepared to go down on his knees to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
if that would prevent bloodshed. He was speaking to about 
12,000 people attending an ANC rally at Bisho Stadium, site of 
the 1992 massacre of 28 ANC supporters by Ciskei Defence Force 
troops. 
  "It is not easy to talk about peace in that situation. In 
spite of that we want to heal the wounds of the past, we want 
reconciliation, because without reconciliation we will not be 
able to give our people a better life." 
  He had spoken to Ciskei military leader Brig Oupa Gqozo 
several times before the massacre and "literally begged" him to 
work with the democratic movement. He had also spoken to 
Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope and was going to speak to 
the kwaZulu chief minister on Tuesday. 
  The bloodshed and the political and economic uncertainty in 
the country could not continue. "That is why, with all 
humility, I am talking to every leader in this country. I will 
not stand on dignity or prestige or any popularity that might be 
enjoyed by our organisation. I will go down on my knees to beg 
those who want to drag our country into bloodshed and to 
persuade them not to do so." 
  This was why he was going to meet Chief Buthelezi in Durban. 
"I want him to participate in this election."

  [Text] The Organization of African Unity has added its 
voice to those urging the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] to take 
part in the election. OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim 
met IFP leader Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Ulundi today. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Gary Alfonso] The OAU 
leader's visit to Ulundi for talks with the IFP and the kwaZulu 
government was the first by a leader of this organization. Both 
Dr. Ahmed Salim and Buthelezi made one thing clear: They had 
different views and perspectives of the transition process and 
especially the elections. 
  [Salim] I believe in this because of these discussions that 
it will be vital in the interest of South Africa that everything 
be done to ensure an all inclusive election where the 
participation of all the political forces in the country, and 
certainly the participation of Inkatha Freedom Party also is 
possible. 
  [Buthelezi] We definitely are doing everything worthwhile 
because we are very keen to participate in the elections, and 
therefore even now at this last moment -- even today -- our 
members of parliament I think, are talking to a select committee 
of Parliament about some of the amendments which were proposed 
by the IFP and the Freedom Alliance. 
  [Alfonso] Both leaders also confirmed that international 
mediation, especially by the OAU, was of critical importance. 
Dr. Buthelezi said free political activity had become almost 
impossible in most parts of Natal. [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 25 SAPA -- Africa expects South 
Africa's leaders to leave no stone unturned to overcome their 
political differences and to enable a free and peaceful 
election. This was the message which Organisation of African 
Unity Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim conveyed in his 
discussions this week to a wide range of political leaders and 
roleplayers. 
  Speaking at a Johannesburg press conference on Friday [25 
February] night, Dr. Salim said more efforts should be made and 
political leaders should get together to find an all-inclusive 
political settlement. It was in the interest of South Africa 
and Africa that dialogue continued, no matter how difficult the 
process. "No stone should be left unturned to see even at this 
11th hour if a solution can be found." 
  He welcomed the announced meeting next Tuesday between 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and 
African National Congress President Nelson Mandela. "This is a 
challenge coming at a critical moment and I hope it will be 
successful," he said. 
  Dr. Salim said his two-hour meeting with Mr Buthelezi in 
Ulundi earlier on Friday had been "very interesting and candid". 
The IFP president had explained his concerns and reservations 
to participating in the election, while Dr. Salim had spelt out 
to him Africa's expectations of a peaceful election in which all 
parties took part. 
  Dr. Salim said he had pointed out to Mr Buthelezi that in 
any 
negotiations, participants had to be prepared to make 
compromises. The government and the ANC had made some 
"significant" concessions, he said. 
  Asked whether he believed the Afrikaner Volksfront's 
[National Front -- AVF] demands for a volkstaat [homeland] were 
reasonable, he said this was a matter for South Africans to 
decide. 
  The OAU would like to see a united South Africa in which 
Afrikaners played an important and constructive role in the 
democratic process, like respecting and understanding the 
country's cultural diversity, he said. 
  Dr. Salim said he remained optimistic about South Africa's 
future for as long as leaders were prepared to talk to each 
other. What gave him hope was that all roleplayers had 
indicated that they still wanted to be part of the democratic 
process, he said. 
  During his fact-finding mission Dr. Salim also had in-depth 
talks with among others Mr Mandela, Foreign Affairs Minister Pik 
Botha, Gen Constand Viljoen of the AVF, Pan Africanist Congress 
Deputy President Johnson Mlambo, Independent Electoral 
Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler and Mr Justice 
Richard Goldstone of the Goldstone Commission. He is to meet 
state President FW de Klerk before his departure on Saturday.

  [Text] On his Cape road show today, National Party [NP] 
leader F.W. de Klerk said that he hoped last-gasp efforts to get 
the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] into the election process would 
succeed even at this late hour. Mr. de Klerk wound up his road 
show in the Strand this afternoon. Conrad Burke reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Burke] Mr. de Klerk, looking confident, 
took his road show to Kraaifontein, one of a belt of suburbs 
which edge onto the farmlands north of the Cape Flats. One of 
the themes he pressed home today was that the National Party 
needed every vote, and that a stayaway vote would benefit the 
ANC [African National Congress]. 
  [De Klerk] We need every vote because the Western Cape, 
where 
we will win, must also help us to win throughout South Africa. 
  [Burke] Today's campaign followed the same pattern as 
yesterday's. At most venues there was a small ANC presence. We 
heard reports that ANC structures here have worked hard these 
past few days restraining ANC members to ensure a degree of 
fairness in the campaign, particularly after the ugly incidents 
in the northern Cape this week. 
  Covering the De Klerk road show in the Cape heat wave with 
its frequent stops in long distances can take it out of even the 
most resilient of journalists. But the organizers have 
organized a luxury air conditioned bus fitted with one of the 
journalist's most favorite companion, a cooler box. 
  It was at one of the retirement meccas, the Strand, that Mr. 
de Klerk referred to ongoing initiatives to win the Inkatha 
Freedom Party's [IFP) participation in the April elections, 
particularly in Natal. He said the absence of the IFP at the 
polls would play into the hands of the ANC. 
  [De Klerk] I, therefore, still have some hope that 
discussions which is [as heard] taking place between for in 
stance some of our spokesmen and spokesmen on behalf of the Zulu 
king, and discussions which is to take place as we read in the 
news on Tuesday between Mr. Mandela and Chief Minister 
Buthelezi, that those discussions will be fruitful so that also 
the Inkatha Freedom Party can become involved in this new 
dispensation. 
  [Burke] One of the features of the De Klerk road show in the 
western Cape was the absence of violent confrontation. Wherever 
we went there was an ANC presence, but the active ingredient was 
one of friendly competition, and the ANC here has put a lot of 
effort into ensuring that this campaign went freely and fairly, 
and this augers well for the elections in the Western Cape. 
  Later this evening Mr. de Klerk had a one and a quarter hour 
meeting at Tuynhuys with the Organization of African Unity's 
[OAU] secretary general, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim. 
  [De Klerk] I had confidence after our discussion that the 
OAU 
is supportive of what is happening in South Africa, that it is 
approaching our problems very correctly in a sense of not trying 
to interfere in any way. 
  [Salim] We have a vested interest in ensuring a peaceful 
process. We have a vested interest in ensuring the emergence of 
a new South Africa, a South Africa which will continue to play 
an important role within the African family. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by R. Colvin] </F>
  [Text] East London Feb 27 SAPA -- It could be up to two 
years before an African National Congress [ANC] government is in 
a position to deliver on its election promise of houses for the 
people, the ANC's secretary-general, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, said in 
East London at the weekend. Ramaphosa also sharply criticised 
the government's economic and peace efforts and warned the 
right-wing the ANC would not tolerate attempts to disrupt the 
election. 
  He highlighted the ANC's concern about the possible 
confusion 
which the late introduction of the double ballot could cause on 
election day. Addressing an election rally in Duncan Village on 
Saturday, Ramaphosa told the crowd the ANC was still confident 
of fulfilling its promise to construct one million houses in 
five years. 
  "We have looked at the budget and we are certain we can 
achieve our goals," he said. However, it was possible houses 
would not be available "in the first or second year of 
government". 
  Ramaphosa told the cheering crowd that any attempt by the 
right-wing to use violence to disrupt the election would be met 
by counterforce. "We have already brought the np government to 
its knees. We will not be pushed around by people like 
(Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] 
Leader Eugene) Terreblanche. 
  "If they (the right-wing) use force we are also prepared to 
use counterforce," he said. Explaining the ANC's willingness to 
continue negotiations with the Freedom Alliance [FA], he said: 
"We have a responsibility to ensure the new government operate 
in a peaceful environment. That is why we sit down with people 
like the FA and grant them their demands." 
  However, while the ANC was willing to concede to the setting 
up of a volksraad [citizens councils] for Afrikaners in 
Parliament, it would never agree to the creation of a volkstaat 
[Afrikaner homeland]. 
  Similarly, while the ANC realised that King Goodwill 
Zwelithini should be given some powers to rule over the Zulus, 
it was not prepared to allow the incorporation of natal into 
kwaZulu. "We want the king in a place where we can respect him 
as a king. But Natal is not going to be independent of the rest 
of South Africa. We will never agree to that." 
  On the double-ballot issue, he said many people were under 
the misconception that they were obliged to vote for another 
party when electing the regional legislature. "The second ballot 
is still for the ANC it is not for the NP [National Party] or 
PAC [Pan- Africanist Congress]," he added. 
  To the delight of the crowd, Mr Ramaphosa took time out to 
[as published] State President F W de Klerk's conservative style 
of dress. "Mandela dresses like a true president. De Klerk is 
always wearing a tie even when he goes out to campaign," he said 
to hoots of laughter. 
  "De Klerk is just a commoner. Mandela is a true president. 
You can see that by the way he walks, speaks, dresses and eats."

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 28 SAPA -- Afrikaner Volksfront 
[AVF, Afrikaner National Front] leaders Tienie Groenewald and 
Constand Viljoen would meet an African National Congress [ANC] 
delegation in Standerton on Monday [28 February] (this) morning 
to discuss a variety of issues affecting the Eastern Transvaal 
town, the ANC said. ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa confirmed an 
ANC delegation led by Mathew Phosa would meet the two Boer 
leaders in Standerton to discuss: 

  -  the declaration of Standerton as part of a "volkstaat" 
[homeland]; 
  -  a planned ANC march through the town on Wednesday (March 2) 
after a previous march in the town ended in confrontation 
between ANC supporters, rightists and the police;

    Mr Mamoepa said the meeting was due to get underway at 9am 
at 
the Standerton town council offices and could last "some time".

<F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>
  [Text] In a scorching open letter on Friday [25 February] 
General Constand Viljoen accused the state president, Mr. F.W. 
de Klerk, of giving "strange advice": "You expect of me, 
through a split, to bring a part of the Afrikaner with me and to 
forget about the others -- like you did using the vague slogan, 
reform -- when you tried to lead your followers into a situation 
of which you have quickly lost control." General Viljoen 
compares President de Klerk's actions to that of a "poor actor" 
trying, in a "one-man show" [preceding two words in English], 
"to regain support lost among his own people from other 
communities." 
  This letter was in reaction to a challenge by President de 
Klerk on Wednesday at Postmasburg for General Viljoen to have 
the courage of his conviction and to do his duty by assuring 
that the "reasonable majority" of the Volksfront [National Front 
-- AVF] participates in the election. 
<H5>  Shocking Tone </H5>
  Yesterday, in a written reply President de Klerk expressed 
his shock at the tone of Gen. Viljoen's open letter: "Malicious 
intent, personal insults, belittling of political opponents, and 
spite does not become you. This diminishes the good image so 
many South Africans have of you." In his letter Gen. Viljoen 
says: "Important components of the South African electorate, 
the Zulus, the Tswanas, and the Boers had to hear that they had 
missed the train. 
  "In endless bilateral and trilateral talks they are taken 
from deadline to deadline, facing the arrogance of those `high 
up' who will `meet them' somewhere possible, like waiting at 
some side station for a train where you decide the time of 
arrival, and where they just have to fit in, whether or not 
their demands have been met. Where the people do not accept 
your concessions they are branded as `spoilers'." 
  To this President de Klerk replies: "You lump together the 
Zulus, the Tswanas, and the Afrikaners as if they all share the 
same viewpoint. Nothing is further removed from the truth than 
this. Also, I am convinced that a majority in each of these 
three groups reject your viewpoint. As far as Afrikaners are 
concerned this has already been proven in two elections and two 
referendums." 
  On the volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] Gen. Viljoen writes: 
"For this reason we asked: Give us a homeland before 27 April 
which would eventually house the larger portion of our people. 
When you and the ANC [African National Congress] refused, we 
asked: Give us the necessary constitutional guarantees so that 
we can get our homeland if we pass the necessary test to prove 
support for this homeland. However, in this regard we must have 
absolute certainty. As far as this issue is concerned I must say 
that we received more understanding from the ANC than from you 
and your party." 
  To this Mr. de Klerk replies: "You are looking for an 
Afrikaner homeland with majority rule. Where would the borders 
for such a homeland be drawn in order to achieve your goal? 
Will all South African citizens, despite race or color, enjoy 
full political rights within those borders? Can you give the 
assurance that there will be no form of discrimination on the 
grounds of race or color in such a region? During our numerous 
discussions you have never succeeded in giving a sensible or 
convincing answer on this issue." 
  General Viljoen takes the president to task for the 
"revolutionary climate which developed under your leadership 
because you have lost control. They (the Afrikaners) do not 
share your bravado because they know that a simple one man one 
vote system will result in them losing permanent control over 
their futures." 
  In President de Klerk's reply he refers to the "clear 
framework" being created in the constitution "for the promotion 
of a homeland and self-determination, linked to a certain 
territory. This is the strategic option you have asked for." 
President de Klerk repeats his Postmasburg plea and renews his 
call to Gen. Viljoen not to allow himself to be "dragged along 
by the wild elements of the National Front who ... have already 
decided on resistance, rebellion, and protest." 
  In what appears to be a direct reference to Gen. Viljoen's 
letter, President de Klerk said yesterday at The Strand: "If 
Gen. Viljoen wants to speak to me on Monday then my door is open 
to him. Each of the amendments to be made to the constitution 
this week is no gimmick, but addresses the fears of the Freedom 
Alliance in a practical manner."

<F P=106> [Speech by Pan-Africanist Congress President Clarence </F>
Makwetu at the funeral service for the late Azanian People's 
Liberation Army commander Sabelo Phama at the Umtata 
Independence Stadium in Transkei; italicized passages in 
Xhosa--live] 
  [Excerpts] Our Land! Africa! Independence! 
  Distinguished guests, comrades, compatriots, friends, 
members 
of the High Command of APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]. 
On Wednesday when I spoke to you here I indicated that I would 
not keep you long, but I regret to say that today I might be 
longer. On the 25 January just after 10 o'clock that night I 
had a long and heavy conversation on the telephone with Sabelo. 
That was the last time I spoke to him. Today, on the 26 
February and exactly one month after that happy telephone 
conversation it is my painful duty to deliver the main oration 
to Comrade Sabelo's funeral. 
  I have come to say goodbye Sabelo! 
  Painful because I have lost a comrade, a friend, a brother, 
and a son, and painful because we are witnessing the passing of 
yet another great son of our people who is following on the 
heels of the great leaders such as Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, 
Nyati John Phokela, David Sibeko, Lekwane Zach Mothopeng, Jack 
Masemula, and numerous others who have gone before. The loss of 
Comrade Sabelo is a severe blow not only to the Pan-Africanist 
Congress of Azania and to APLA [Azanian People's Liberation 
Army], which led with such unparalleled distinction, but to the 
broad liberation movement and suffering African masses as a 
whole. We shall miss him deeply. 
  He will always be remembered by us! 
  There is no need to sing Comrade Sabelo's praises because 
his 
life, which he dedicated selflessly to the service of the 
oppressed African people, is an open book which is there for all 
to read. He led by example -- a true warrior and illustrious 
leader in the noblest tradition of our forefathers. There is no 
need to extol his commitment to the liberation of his motherland 
and his people, indeed when death struck its cruel blow Sabelo 
was on the road to yet another meeting which would have advanced 
the course of our liberation struggle. His life was cut short 
on a long and lonely road in Tanzania -- the African skies and 
the African bush his only cover. 
  It is an indelible indictment of the racist apartheid 
policies that such a gifted man, so loyal and African, so 
dedicated a husband and father, so trustworthy a companion and 
friend, should die far away from home, precisely because he had 
been driven away from home and country by a burning desire to 
rid his land of the scourge of racism and imperialism. It is a 
cruel irony that Comrade Sabelo died at dawn of a new era on the 
eve of elections for a constituent assembly in which he would 
have taken his rightful place with other leaders of the 
Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC], to shape and determine the 
destiny of African people as desired by the African people 
themselves. 
  If only we had the power to shape and determine our 
destiny as we desire! 
  For Comrade Sabelo and for all our comrades in APLA, the 
army 
of the African people fighting for the genuine liberation of our 
country from colonialism and racism, there was no alternative to 
the violence of the regime but the response of the barrel of the 
gun. Against our will we were forced into battle by the 
political tyranny of apartheid and its violent and barbaric army 
and police. We took a decision that a gun will be answered 
with a gun! Yet, our position has always been quite 
simple. If we are hit we hit back and we hit back hard. 
  Among us today are senior personnel of APLA. We salute them 
and extend our deepest gratitude to them as true and dedicated 
soldiers for the liberty of man from tyranny and oppression. 
I will not forget that we still have a long way to 
go! 
  Unlike the settler community and its elite reactionaries 
drawn from the rank of the oppressed, we want to tell the world 
in very clear terms that APLA is not a terrorist army. We want 
to tell the world that Comrade Sabelo was not a terrorist. We 
want to tell the world that Comrade Phama, even in death, 
remains a true hero of our struggle. He gave his life for 
the liberation of his people! 
  We want to tell the world that APLA is the army of the 
oppressed African masses and every single one of them with us 
here today and those still in the bush are our heroes, and we 
also want to say this to the oppressors: APLA shall come back 
in victory and no force on earth shall stop our march to 
victory. We are determined to conquer shaka [referring to 
the regime]! 
  Those who are searching for terrorists must take a closer 
look at the murderers who are employed by the regime. The true 
and only terrorists are in the CCB (Civil Cooperation Bureau], 
in the hit squads of the SAP [South African Police], and the 
foreign mercenaries of Koevoet [crowbar; police 
counterinsurgency unit], and 32 Battalion. Those are the 
terrorists. 
  Just three days before my last conversation with Comrade 
Sabelo, the PAC announced a unilateral suspension of hostilities 
against the regime. Comrade Sabelo and the entire top structure 
of APLA unanimously endorsed the decision because we wanted to 
show the world that we do not engage in violence for the sake of 
violence. We wanted to isolate the true agents of violence, who 
are the regime and its assorted gangs of murderers. 
  We were not forced by the regime or by anyone else to 
suspend 
the arms struggle. We did not sign any minutes and we did not 
compromise any of our ideals and principles. We resisted all 
attempts by the regime, both inside and outside the country ... 
[break in transmission] ... to negotiate the future of the arms 
struggle of the African people. The terrain of our struggle has 
now shifted and we claim one major victory. We forced the 
regime to give in on the question of an elected constituent 
assembly and a new task has now begun. 
  In April we will fight the elections for a constituent 
assembly based on the universal principle of one person one 
vote. It is the constituent assembly where the African people 
themselves will write a constitution acceptable to them, a 
constitution for true liberation and freedom. Not half 
liberation! 
  Our people inside and outside the country have endorsed 
unreservedly our decision to fight the elections to enable us to 
win a mandate from you to write a constitution which will set 
you free in the land of your forefathers. We in the PAC believe 
there are only two choices facing you at the elections. You 
either elect parties which will form a new government, which 
includes your oppressors and a new elite drawn from the ranks of 
oppressed, or you elect the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania. 
  The first choice shall never give you freedom but will only 
perpetuate your subjugation while entrenching the privileges 
which the minority enjoy at your expense. The second choice, an 
overwhelming vote for the PAC, shall set you free. The PAC is 
the only party in this country which has never compromised or 
sold out on the sacred duty which the African people entrusted 
to us. That sacred duty is the task of leading our people to 
freedom. Last weekend in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, we unveiled 
our election manifesto. Since then, and not surprisingly, there 
has been numerous attempts by the regime and its (?affiliates) 
to discredit our principles. They have tried everything 
to discredit us! 
  The reason why we are being attacked is not hard to 
understand. The regime and its surrogates are running scared. 
They are running scared because they realize that the moment of 
truth has finally arrived. They are running scared because they 
realize the PAC has finally arrived. We have never made any 
secret of our intention to reclaim our land from those who stole 
it, but just in case the regime and its apologists did not hear 
us clearly last weekend, let us repeat ourselves today. We are 
going to get our land from you and we shall then hand it back to 
its rightful and historical owners, the African people. 
[applause] We will take back this land give it to its 
owners, the Africans! 
  During their election campaign our ideological and political 
opponents have made promises to pay the settlers for any land 
taken back. We in the PAC make no such promises. The PAC shall 
not pay anyone for our land and we make no apologies for that. 
[applause] An overwhelming majority for the PAC at elections 
will give you a constitution which shall enshrine the land as 
your inalienable property because the land belongs to you. We 
shall reclaim the land by constitutional means and Africans who 
were forcibly removed from their land by apartheid and racism 
will have the right to claim their land back. 
  In addition to land we promise you a caring economy, an 
economy which will benefit every citizen of our country. Up to 
now the minority has accumulated great wealth on the sweat of 
our people, and under a PAC government that will stop. We shall 
not nationalize institutions because it is not our policy to 
create fat cats by transferring wealth from one class of elites 
to new ones. Instead we shall democratize and socialize the 
economy to benefit everyone, particularly the African masses who 
are the major victims of poverty. In short our economic policy 
will declare war on poverty, hunger, disease, unemployment, and 
homelessness. 
  Under a PAC government our children shall go back to school 
and we shall bring back the culture of learning. The 
intimidation which has destroyed the careers of hundreds of 
thousands of our children will stop. For far too long the class 
boycotts have been spearheaded by hypocrites whose own children 
have never been cannon fodder for the guns of the racist police 
and we say that will now stop, and we promise you an end to the 
violence wrecking our country. A government of the PAC will not 
sit back and fold its arms and watch passively while Africans' 
blood is spilt in violence, which serves the purposes of the 
oppressors. 
  Too much precious African blood has been shed already and 
one 
more drop is one drop too many. Comrade Sabelo would not have 
wanted us to achieve less for you. His life was dedicated to 
improving the quality of life for the African people in a 
liberated country. Our people inside and outside the country, 
in APLA and all other structures of the PAC, demand that we go 
out and win the elections in April so that the African people 
can determine their own destiny. 
  In a final farewell to our fallen hero I have a message for 
our young people. You all loved Comrade Sabelo in life and you 
all drew inspiration from the noble and exemplary manner in 
which he selflessly answered the call of duty. Take a leaf from 
the life of a great man and true patriot. Whatever you do in 
life, whatever your task in the name of our struggle for 
liberation, do it diligently. Do it with honor and dignity. Do 
it in the loving memory of your hero. 
  To our beloved sister and his widow, Comrade Dudu, and to 
her 
young sons Andile and Sandile, we give a message of courage and 
strength. You are not alone in your grief in these trying times 
of personal anguish. The whole nation of Africans is right 
beside you and right behind you. Do not despair for the dawn of 
liberation is near and when that day dawns we shall proudly and 
jubilantly raise the flag of liberty on Comrade Sabelo's grave. 
  To his parents we give gratitude for having given him to the 
noble task of liberating Africans. Few sons of the soil have 
exerted themselves with such distinction. Sabelo's contribution 
to the struggle for emancipation can never be measured or fully 
explained in words. Indeed, when the true history of the 
African people is written, the name of Sabelo Phama will be 
etched in gold. 
  To the African nation we say: Go out and win elections 
convincingly. Go out and win it for Sabelo Phama and ideas for 
which he lived and died. Go out and win in memory of our fallen 
hero so that he may take the good news of our victory to 
Sobukwe, Phokela, and Mothopeng. And to all of our 
heroes! Go out and win in the name of freedom and liberty. 
  As for all of us gathered here today over the noble bones of 
our hero we rededicate ourselves even more diligently to the 
attainment of the ideals for which Sabelo Phama lived and died. 
We make this final pledge to our departed hero. We shall get 
our land back and the African people shall be free.

  [Excerpt] Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] supporters should 
"sharpen their weapons" because there are bad times ahead, 
Azanian People's Liberation Army (Apla) political commissar 
Romero Daniels said yesterday. Speaking before a crowd of 
10,000 which filled Umtata's Independence Stadium for the 
funeral of Apla commander Sabelo Phama, Daniels said attempts to 
establish a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] amounted to 
provocation. Daniels said the "absurd boerestaat" [Boere state] 
advocated by General Constand Viljoen could be regarded as 
"provocation for the continuation of the war." 
  "The moratorium on armed struggle declared by the PAC -- and 
fully endorsed by Apla -- was not a defeat of the freedom 
fighters. We are political fighters giving the masses of Azania 
the chance to decide their own form of government. So to Apla 
fighters, we say: be ready, be on the alert, sharpen your 
weapons for any eventuality by the enemy, be combat-ready. We 
are heading for bitter times." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Conservative Party [CP] finds it amusing and at 
the same time ridiculous that the United States, with its record 
of unsuccessful integration, should now come and help to bring 
about integration in the South African Defense Force [SADF]. 
  Chief Secretary for the CP Dr. Lem Theron says it seems as 
though the American contribution is directed at giving 
assistance to the ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South 
African Communist Party] alliance so as to subject whites within 
the SADF to the authority of the ANC-SACP blacks in a process of 
blatant racist affirmative action. 
  The CP requests all military personnel who are to be 
subjected to this degrading and humiliating action to see the 
American advisers for what they really are as there is no merit 
for their so-called expertise regarding racial integration. Dr. 
Theron said the U.S. is an excellent example of a country where 
racial integration has failed. Since the 1960's, the U.S. has 
been trying -- with its "melting pot" [preceding two words in 
English] approach -- to unite all races and cultures in one big 
American society. 
  These efforts have failed dismally despite forced blackening 
of white schools through active integration of blacks in the 
civil service through affirmative action and others, such as the 
dishing out of significant roles to blacks in movies. 
  Despite all their efforts, the natural tendency for races to 
associate with their own has led to the phenomenon where blacks 
and other ethnic groups have demonstrated -- in the course of 
time -- preference for association with their own people by 
spontaneously establishing black and own culture-dominated 
schools. 
  There are currently 18 black-dominated universities in the 
U.S.A. which give priority to black students. 
  According to Dr. Theron, the black caucus in the U.S.A's 
House of Representatives is damning evidence against forced 
racial integration.

  [Text] Kimberley Feb 25 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] did not want to lower the high standards of the 
South African Defence Force [SADF], ANC leader Nelson Mandela 
said on Friday [25 February]. He was addressing 10,000 people 
who attended a peoples' forum to raise issues with the 
leadership at the Galeshewe Stadium in Kimberley. 
  A questioner asked how matriculation could remain a 
qualification for membership of the ANC's armed wing Umkhonto we 
Sizwe (MK) [Spear of the Nation] if the future government was to 
provide only 10 years of free education. 
  Mr Mandela said MK members must at least have a 
matriculation 
certificate. "The SADF, with which we are now uniting and which 
has had an opportunity for education, is very well qualified. 
Officers require certain academic qualifications and many of 
them are highly educated." 
  This was evident at a recent meeting with the General Staff 
of the SADF at which he could see from the way they presented 
their arguments that they were well educated. "We do not want 
to bring down the standards of the army. We want to keep them 
as high as they are," he said. "Even in the reorganisation we 
will not get the qualifications we want; we must have at least 
matric," he said. The 10 years of free education was a first 
target and a future government would hope to increase it in 
stages.

Durban on Monday morning, IFP spokesman Ed Tillet said. Police 
spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo was not immediately available to 
comment, but police had cordoned off the area around the IFP

  "The first bomb was in the building," said Mr Tillet."The

  [Text] Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, currently 
visiting South Africa, has held informal talks with President 
F.W. De Klerk. The two men discussed possible ways open to the 
Netherlands and the European Union to bring pressure to bear on 
Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. His Inkatha Freedom Party has 
rejected repeated calls from President De Klerk and ANC [African 
National Congress] leader Nelson Mandela to take part in the 
April general elections. 
  During his visit to South Africa the Dutch Prime Minister 
will not be meeting Chief Buthelezi. On Sunday Mr. Lubbers did 
meet members of another party boycotting the April poll -- the 
white Conservative Party. The talks were attended by Dutch 
Deputy Prime Minister Wim Kok and Foreign Minister Pieter 
Kooijmans. After the meeting the Dutch Government delegation 
described the attitude of the Conservative Party as worrying.

<F P=106> [By Raphael Banda] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 28 SAPA -- African National 
Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela on Monday ruled out any 
possibility that he would agree to the postponment of the April 
elections as a concession to woo organisations that are 
boycotting the first all- race poll."The postponement of 
elections is a recipe for bloodshed and disaster," ANC spokesman 
Carl Niehaus commented privately. 
  Addressing a news conference after meeting visiting Dutch 
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and a day before crucial talks with 
Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Mr Mandela 
repeated he will press ahead with efforts to bring boycotters 
into the election process. But he made it clear that his crusade 
would rest on two main considerations. 
  "That the date set for the elections will under no 
circumstances be postponed and secondly that... the sovereignty 
of South Africa as a united nation must under no circumstances 
be violated." 
  Mr Mandela was apparently referring to demands for 
self-determinatioon and for a volkstaat [homeland] by the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and rightwing political groups. The 
IFP is also reported to to have started moves for the election 
to be postponed in kwaZulu/Natal. 
  "Within that framework I am prepared to spend the rest of my 
days in an attempt to persuade every South African leader to 
join us," Mr Mandela said. 
  Asked whether he was optimistic about his meeting with Mr 
Buthelezi on Tuesday, Mr Mandela said dialogue was the ANC's 
weapon which it would employ to sway groups bent on shuning the 
process. "I approach every problem with optimism, because 
dialogue is one of the most important weapons that we command," 
he said after meeting Mr Lubbers. 
  Touching on political violence, Mr Mandela said it was a 
duty 
of all South Africans to address the issue of violence to create 
a proper environment for investment. The violence was creating 
conditions where it was difficult to predict the economic or 
political situation. 
  The ANC leader also said his organsiation was making 
progress 
in talks with rightwing organisations. He did not elaborate, but 
has repeatedly said in the past that the ANC will not cave in to 
demands for a volkstaat. 
  Mr Lubbers said he hoped ties between South Africa and his 
country, which gave the ANC substantial financial and moral 
support during its 30 years of anti-partheid struggle, will be 
closer in the future. 
  Mr Mandela said Holland was one of the countries to throw 
their weight behind the ANC campaign "in the most difficult time 
in our struggle".

  [Text] Norway has lifted its last economic sanctions 
against South Africa. It repealed a 1986 ban on oil exports and 
oil shipments and other economic sanctions imposed in 1987 to 
help remove apartheid. Norway said developments in South Africa 
and plans for elections in April this year had made sanctions 
obsolete. Another contributing factor was the United Nations 
General Assembly resolution last October in which member nations 
were urged to follow African national Congress leader Nelson 
Mandela's request to end sanctions. Norway was one of the first 
countries to impose sanctions against South Africa and to give 
aid to the African National Congress.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>
  Voters Urged To Determine Transition Outcome -- "Mr Nelson 
Mandela's meeting with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Tuesday may 
turn out to be more than another round of political theatre, but 
don't bank on it," states the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in 
English on 27 February in a page-22 editorial. "Mr Mandela has 
moved about as far as he can towards meeting the Zulu leader's 
demands, and Mr Buthelezi is too wounded, too aggrieved, too 
defensive to risk a generous impulse. There is a chance of 
progress, but it's a slim, slim chance." Continuing, the 
editorial questions whether the talks that have been going on 
between the government, the African National Congress [ANC], and 
the Freedom Alliance truly qualify as negotiations and not 
simply "manipulation of public perceptions." At the end of the 
day, what the public must do is "brace" itself "for the 
probability that the election will go ahead without either 
Inkatha or the Conservative Party," and because support for the 
Freedom Alliance is not large enough to cause the boycott to 
"change the course of our history," the electorate must now deal 
with "the sombre prospect that they will try by terror and 
violence to achieve what they cannot do by democratic methods." 
Therefore, "the decent majority of voters must gather their 
courage and harden their determination to vote no matter what 
the threats or the terror inflicted by the violent minorities." 
<H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>
  Plan Against Election Spoilers Urged -- "As the election 
campaign of the ANC reaches fever pitch, we hope the 
organisation has not relegated the importance of defending the 
country's democratic constitution after the April elections to 
the bottom rung of its priorities," begins the Johannesburg 
SUNDAY NATION in English on 27 February in a page-6 editorial. 
"We cannot recall in history anywhere in the world where there 
was a major rupture with an old political order and transfer of 
power without resistance from the old rulers." Because of this, 
"what is needed is a concrete contingency plan to thwart any 
attempt to prevent the democratic government from taking office."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Warning Against Risky Election Road Shows -- "We don't think 
State President de Klerk should go on roadshows -- and neither 
should ANC [African National Congress] president Nelson 
Mandela," says the page-6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN 
in English on 25 February. The country is "in too volatile a 
state to risk incidents in which they may be harmed in any way." 
As for the National Party (NP) signing a pledge that its 
members will not take part in violence, or Mandela calling on 
his supporters to allow other leaders and parties into the 
townships, "is not going to prevent election violence or 
safeguard leaders." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Role for DP, PAC in April Election -- Johannesburg THE STAR 
in English for 28 February in a page-10 editorial finds that the 
Democratic Party (DP) and the Pan-Africanist Party (PAC) "each 
has a special place" in the forthcoming April election. "Cool, 
reasoned, at times rather sanctimonious, for today and tomorrow 
the DP's value is as a conscience. In decades to come, the DP's 
stress on individual rights will surely turn out to have been 
the pioneer of a new and nobler age. The PAC could hardly be 
more different. It has a gigantic (`we will win') capacity for 
self-delusion; an unquestioning faith in the (African) group; a 
Marxian (Groucho?) grasp of logic. Yet the two parties have a 
common concern: part of the PAC's support is about reluctance 
to see Big Brother ANC become overlarge, just as part of the 
DP's background concerns the same fear in respect of the Nats. 
That sentiment is invaluable in any society, and vital for the 
health of a democracy. The challenge is to let the adherents of 
both polar positions believe there is a place in the sun for 
them." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC `Naivety' on Building Business Confidence -- 
Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 28 February in a page-14 editorial 
says the ANC leaders' attempts to develop business confidence 
have been less than unconditionally successful for a number of 
reasons. "First, even when the ANC expresses roughly the correct 
sentiments on key issues, it displays some naivety on how 
confidence is built. Arguing, for example, as Ramaphosa did, 
that an ANC government would lift exchange controls when it was 
satisfied business would not export capital is putting the cart 
before the horse. A regime permitting a free flow of capital is 
one ingredient needed to develop confidence. Second, the 
careful work carried out in the business community is regularly 
negated by ill-considered statements, such as those about 
nationalising mineral rights. It may be true that the business 
community is oversensitive, and sometimes sees threats where 
there are none. But that is a function of the uncertainty of 
our times, and the ANC needs to display greater awareness." 
BUSINESS DAY wonders how successfully the ANC will manage the 
"often conflicting pressures from the business sector on the one 
hand and the party's mass constituency on the other."

<F P=106> [Report by Kang Yu-feng from the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] A ROC delegation led by Hsu Shui-teh, secretary 
general of the Kuomintang [KMT] Central Committee, will leave on 
30 January to attend the 1993 U.S. Prayer Breakfast Meeting. 
The delegation was specially invited by the U.S. Congress. As 
guests invited to attend the [word indistinct] historical 
breakfast meeting are leaders and vital political figures from 
various countries in the world. The meeting has been given 
considerable importance in the international community. In 
keeping with Sino-American tradition, the ROC delegation will 
[words indistinct]. This will promote substantial friendly and 
stable Sino-American relations. The size of the delegation, led 
by Secretary General Hsu, is not only large but is also quite 
representative. The delegation includes Chang Hsiao-hsien, 
minister of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Tai 
Jui-ming, deputy secretary general to the president and 
presidential spokesman; Legislators Kuan Chung and Kuo 
Chin-sheng; National Assembly representatives [names 
indistinct]; Lai Kuo-chou, secretary general of the ROC News and 
Sports Commission; Tu Lun-kang, president of Da An Commercial 
Bank; Liu Chin-cheng, president of Central Leasing Company; and 
Hsu Tung-ping, president of East Taiwan Development Company. 
  The delegation will arrive in Los Angeles on the afternoon 
of 
30 January. During his stay, apart from attending the U.S. 
Prayer Breakfast Meeting, to be presided over by President 
Clinton on 3 February, and the Congress lunch meeting, to be 
chaired by Vice President Gore, Secretary General Hsu will 
separately meet Senate Majority Leader Mitchell; Robb, chairman 
of the Asia-Pacific Subcommittee of the Senate's Foreign 
Relations Committee; Ackerman, chairman of the Asia-Pacific 
Subcommittee of the Congress's Foreign Affairs Committee; 
president of the Republican Party National Committee; and 
(Paileichi), interim chairman of the American Institute in 
Taiwan, as well as several other leaders and diplomats. 
  As the visit is another official diplomatic activity of 
high-ranking leaders during our government's promotion of 
pragmatic diplomacy policy, it will not only be helpful in 
promoting substantial Sino-American relations, but also a strong 
manifestation of the KMT's promotion of party diplomacy, which 
bears significant meaning. Apart from the above-mentioned 
itinerary, the delegation is expected to hold large discussion 
meetings in several major overseas Chinese-populated cities such 
as Los Angeles, Washington, New York, Houston, and San 
Francisco. The trips will enable us to understand the concern 
of overseas Chinese over national affairs and visit the Chinese 
community there. The delegation is expected to end their trip 
and return home on 8 February.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, Jan. 27 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan 
will change his itinerary and visit the Bahamas after winding up 
his trip in Honduras Friday [28 January], Jason Hu, 
director-general of the Government Information Office, said 
Thursday. 
  Lien originally planned to leave Tegucigalpa Friday and 
return home via San Francisco. 
  The Bahamas, however, had been keen to have Lien visit while 
he was in Latin America, and so Lien agreed to a one-day 
stopover, according to Chang Ping-nan, the ROC ambassador to the 
Bahamas. 
  Lien and his 17-member entourage attended the inauguration 
of 
new Honduran President Carlo Roberto Reina on Thursday. The 
ceremony was held at Tegucigalpa National Stadium and lasted 
four hours. 
  Lien later met with Nicaraguan President Violeta de 
Chamorro. 
He greeted Chamorro on behalf of President Li Teng-hui and 
expressed his appreciation for Nicaragua's support of the ROC in 
the international community. 
  Nicaragua and six other Latin American countries submitted a 
letter to United Nations Secretary-General Butros Butros-Ghali, 
asking that the ROC's UN bid be put on the agenda for the 
General Assembly in September. The request was later voted 
downed. 
  Chamorro said that she was honored to be able to speak up 
for 
the ROC in the international community and said she would 
continue to do so. She also invited Li and Lien to visit 
Nicaragua. 
  Lien also met briefly with Belize President Manuel Esquival 
and Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. Esquival 
expressed the hope that relations between Belize and the ROC 
could be cemented. He also said that Belize's vice premier and 
foreign minister will visit the ROC soon.

  [Text] Taipei will not cut tariffs on more than 200 
agricultural and industrial products, including automobiles, as 
demanded by Washington D.C., Director of the Board of Foreign 
Trade Huang Yen-chao stated. The some 200 items among 699 
products were listed late last year by Washington for an 
immediate 50 percent customs duty reduction. After discussions 
and evaluation with concerned authorities, about 200 items have 
no room for tariff cuts, Huang said. The government can reduce 
import tax on about 70 of the 699 items, while the remaining 
ones need to go through long resistance at the legislature 
before duty reductions are possible, he added. Huang stated 
tariff reduction rates and reasons behind the selective 
reduction policy will be forwarded to Washington for explanation 
within a week. The tariff reductions are expected to go into 
effect within two months [words indistinct]. 
  Taipei had intended to hold discussion with the U.S. on the 
tariff reductions during bilateral assessment talks on Taiwan's 
entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] 
slated for next month, but Washington, a key supporter of 
Taipei's GATT membership, refused and demanded a consultation.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 29 (CNA) -- Wu Shu, the chief 
secretary of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), met with 
officials of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait (ARATS) Saturday [29 January] in a preparatory meeting to 
the high-level cross-Strait talks slated for Feb. 1-5. 
  Wu arrived in Beijing Friday as head of a four-man SEF 
contingent to arrange the agenda of talks between SEF Vice 
Chairman and Secretary-General Chiao Jen-ho and ARATS Vice 
President and Secretary-General Tang Shubei. Chiao will arrive 
here on Jan. 31. 
  The Chiao-Tang talks will be the highest-level cross-Strait 
talks since the Singapore negotiations between SEF Chairman Ku 
Chen-fu and his ARATS counterpart, Wang Daohan, in April last 
year. 
  Officials of the SEF and ARATS, the two intermediary 
organizations authorized by Taipei and Beijing to handle cross- 
Strait exchanges in the absence of official ties between the 
two, failed to reach any concrete agreements in three follow-up 
meetings to the Singapore talks. 
  The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) earlier said that it 
hoped 
the Chiao-Tang talks would "create favorable conditions" for a 
second round of Ku-Wang negotiations. 
  The SEF had earlier proposed that Chiao and Tang focus on 
four main areas of discussion: 
  -- The effectiveness of the SEF and ARATS in promoting 
cross-Strait exchanges, such as in the implementation of 
agreements on the authentification of documents and compensation 
for lost registered mail; 
  -- The results of the three follow-up talks to the Koo-Wang 
meeting; 
  -- The implementation of issues agreed upon during the 
Singapore talks, including cross-Strait economic cooperation and 
cultural exchanges, and protection of Taiwan investors in the 
mainland; and 
  -- Other issues of mutual concern, such as the repatriation 
from Taiwan of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants, and 
the joint crackdown on drug and arms smuggling.

  [Text] Taiwan officials have accused Mainland China of 
stalling the repatriation of illegal immigrants and threatened 
to send them home without China's cooperation. Taiwan has 
deported 25,299 Chinese immigrants since 1987, but it is holding 
another 2,346. Future repatriations have not yet been arranged 
with Mainland China, said the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC], 
which handles the government's contacts with Peking [Beijing]. 
The Mainland Chinese come to seek better-paying jobs in Taiwan. 
Council Vice Chairman [Shu Chi] told reporters who visited the 
Hsinchu detention center that some of them have stayed in Taiwan 
over a year all because of the mainland's lack of sincerity in 
cooperating with the repatriation operations. 
  In 1990, the Red Cross Society of Taiwan and Mainland China 
agreed to repatriate the mainland illegal immigrants within 20 
days of their arrest. Under the agreement, Taiwan sent the 
illegal immigrants to the island of Matsu near the Fuchien 
[Fujian] coast of south China for the pickup by Mainland Chinese 
boats.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 29 (CNA) -- Taiwan's United 
Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) will transfer its advanced 0.8- 
micrometer integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing technology to 
the German semiconductor maker Thesys, a company spokesman said 
Saturday [29 January]. 
  It is the first time that a Taiwan company has sold its IC 
technical know-how to a European firm, the spokesman noted. UMC 
is Taiwan's top and the world's 31st largest IC producer. 
  Under a cooperative contract signed in Taipei by UMC 
Chairman 
Tsao Hsing-cheng and Thesys Chairman Cludio Loddo [spelling of 
name as received], UMC will transfer 0.8-micrometer IC design 
rules, production facilities and management expertise to the 
German firm. Thesys will pay UMC millions of US dollars in 
royalties. 
  Meanwhile, the spokesman said, Thesys will produce 2,000 6 
inch IC wafers a month on an original equipment manufacturing 
basis for UMC starting late this year. Thesys has technology 
for producing 1.2-micrometer ICs and can turn out 30,000 6-inch 
wafers monthly. 
  "By cooperating with Thesys, our company has gained greater 
access to the European market," the spokesman noted. 
  UMC began to produce 7-micrometer ICs 17 years ago by buying 
know-how from America's RCA Co. with a paid-in capital of NT 
[New Taiwan] $6 billion (US$226 million), the company registered 
a business turnover of NT$10 bill on (US$377.35 million) in 1993. 
  Taiwan had a 2.67 percent share of the world's total IC 
output last year and the ratio is expected to rise to 10 or 15 
percent in the next few years as all major local IC producers 
have launched expansion projects, industry sources said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji stressed today that to mobilize the whole nation to 
give firm support to and take an active part in the country's 
current reform is one of the major tasks of the ideological and 
media workers. 
  Zhu, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party 
(CCPCC), made the remark at an on-going national conference on 
ideological and media work in Beijing. 
  He urged those working on the ideological and media front to 
serve the overall needs of "seizing opportunities, deepening the 
reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting economic 
development and maintaining social stability". 
  He said that ideological and media work should give correct 
guidance and have a clear-cut stand supporting reform. 
  Ideological workers must have a good understanding of the 
party's range of policies and make full, correct and timely 
reports on economic development as a whole, he said. 
  The vice-premier pointed out that the principle of "telling 
the truth, bringing the initiative of the masses into full play, 
and achieving actual gains" should be carried out to promote a 
sustained, fast and sound economic development. 
  It is a bounden duty for the ideological and media workers 
to 
maintain social stability and to give the broad masses a clear 
explanation of the party's policies in the course of reform, he 
said. 
  Zhu fully affirmed the great achievements made by the 
ideological and media workers in the reform and economic 
development over the past decade, and he also briefed the 
conference participants on the national economic development in 
1993. 
  Speaking of the current favorable climate of reform and 
opening to the outside world, he said that the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics has struck root 
in the hearts of the people after a decade of reform. 
  And the party and the government have accumulated a wealth 
of 
experience, he said, adding that China's economic development 
has been encouraging since the publication of Deng Xiaoping's 
important speech in 1992. 
  He said that some problems that occurred on the way forward 
have been solved by taking a range of macro-economic control 
measures. 
  The framework of a socialist market economic structure 
worked 
out by the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress 
of the CCPCC has laid a solid ideological foundation for 
implementing the current reform policies, Zhu said. 
  Zhu emphasized that the current rare historical 
opportunities 
should be seized firmly and valued highly "to do what we wanted 
to do in the past, but could not do." 
  When talking about the reform program for this year, Zhu 
said, "the preparatory work is adequate and we are quite ready 
to overcome the difficulties before us." 
  The vice-premier quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying "the whole 
party and the whole nation must be told that it is a hard task" 
and "there are no perfect policies or methods." 
  He noted that the main risk, currently, does not lie in the 
reform itself, but in the overexpansion of investment in fixed 
assets, which has gone beyond the capacity of the nation to 
build on the investment. 
  The agricultural problem remains outstanding, he pointed 
out, 
adding that some people are keen on creating a larger scale or 
faster speed or high consumption. 
  "They are not interested in the economic returns, practicing 
of economy, making profits, and taking care of the well-being of 
the broad masses," he said. 
  He stressed that this situation must be changed. 
  The vice-premier said that great efforts should be made this 
year to cut down on the scale of fixed asset investment and to 
continue the development of the rural economy. 
  He stressed that party committees and governments at all 
levels must pay still more attention to the reform and the 
leading cadres must stand in the forefront of carrying out the 
reform program in the new year.

  [Text] Beijing, January 29 (XINHUA) -- The reform of 
ideological and media work must meet the needs of a socialist 
market economy and China's modernization drive, a senior Chinese 
Communist Party leader said today. 
  Addressing a national work conference on ideological and 
media work which ended here today, Ding Guangen, a member of the 
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee, said that the reform must also conform to the law 
governing the development of cultural and media undertakings. 
  He stressed that in carrying out the reform, it was 
imperative to pay close attention to the promotion of cultural 
and ideological progress; follow the principles of democracy and 
providing guidance to the people and focus on mobilizing their 
initiative; rely on all sectors of society and be good at 
employing modern mass media. 
  It was also imperative to step up macro-management of 
cultural and media undertakings; cultivate a socialist cultural 
market; study and draw on outstanding cultural achievements and 
managerial expertise in other countries; restructure the 
management of cultural and media undertakings; and systematize 
and standardize cultural and media work. 
  Ding, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the party 
Central Committee, said: "To implement various tasks put 
forward by the party Central Committee on the ideological and 
media front, it is essential to have a competent contingent." 
  According to Ding, the holding of the conference 
demonstrates 
that the party Central Committee persists in placing equal 
emphasis on both material progress and cultural and ideological 
progress. 
  The conference was also intended to mobilize the whole party 
to strengthen and improve ideological and media work in order to 
provide a "powerful ideological guarantee" and a "fine public 
opinion environment" for the reform, economic expansion and 
stability in China, the leader told the closing session. 
  Ding, who is also head of the Propaganda Department of the 
party Central Committee, expressed the belief that the 
conference would certainly help to improve the ideological and 
media work and make sure that all tasks assigned by the party 
Central Committee will be implemented to the letter. 
  Delegates to the conference pledged to implement the tasks 
on 
the ideological and media front and to improve their work. 
  To this end, it was necessary to further emancipate the 
mind, 
seek truth from facts and take the road of the reform and 
opening to the outside world, they noted.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 28 (XINHUA) -- Zhu Rongji, member of 
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC 
Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council, 
stressed today at the National Conference on Propaganda and 
Ideological Work in Beijing: To mobilize hundreds of millions 
of people to support and take an active part in reform is one of 
the major tasks of the propaganda and ideological front. In the 
new year, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front 
subject themselves to and serve the overall needs of "seizing 
opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside 
world, promoting economic development, and maintaining social 
stability." They must provide correct guidance for public 
opinion; take a clear-cut stand in support of reform; have a 
good understanding of and publicize the party's principles and 
policies; and make full, correct, and timely reports on economic 
development as a whole. The principle of doing solid work, 
telling the truth, bringing the initiative of the masses into 
full play, and achieving actual gains should be carried out to 
promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
They should regard it as their duty to maintain social 
stability and help solve any ideological and perceptual problems 
which might arise in the course of reform by providing clear and 
timely explanations. 
  First, Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the tremendous progress 
comrades on the propaganda and ideological front have achieved 
over the years in serving reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive while under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line. He urged them to 
continue playing a still greater role in reform and development. 
  Zhu Rongji briefed the conference on China's economic 
situation in 1993. He said: The year 1993 saw China implement 
in an all-round manner the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and march triumphantly along the course of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics charted by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping. Over the past year, industrial development has 
increased its pace; economic returns of enterprises have 
improved; new progress has been made in the development of the 
rural economy; and production of grains and edible oil has 
reached new highs. We have increased efforts and greatly 
accelerated construction of key projects; the consumer goods 
market has been brisk; and the people's standard of living has 
risen continuously. In connection with the conspicuous 
contradictions and problems which have arisen in the first half 
of 1993 as a result of rapid economic growth, the Central 
Committee took the resolute step of strengthening and improving 
macroeconomic regulation and control, thus swiftly halting the 
tendency of over extension of credit, over supply of currency, 
and the rapid drop in the exchange rate of the Renminbi. 
Consequently, order in the banking and circulation sectors has 
improved markedly. The policy of macroeconomic regulation and 
control has yielded positive results. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Now is the most opportune time for 
deepening reform. First, the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics has struck root in the hearts of the 
people after a decade or so of reform. Following the 
publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches in 
1992 and the triumphant convocation of the 14th CPC National 
Congress, our party, has broken the ideological bonds of whether 
our reform is capitalist or socialist by clearly defining the 
goals of socialist market economic reforms, thereby emancipating 
our minds and making it possible for us to be free of fear and 
restraint in formulating a fairly forward-looking and stable 
reform program to tackle the salient economic problems facing us 
today by following the general law of market economy, drawing on 
the successful experience of developed countries, and proceeding 
from the realities of China. Second, the CPC Central Committee 
and the State Council have accumulated a wealth of experience in 
reform in the past decade or so. In implementing reform, we 
have gone through many difficulties, have experienced success as 
well setbacks, and have learned some lessons. The current 
reform program -- its principles and framework have been studied 
for years -- embodies the experience of many years of practice. 
A majority consensus has emerged in theoretical circles after 
repeated discussion and analysis. Third, after the publication 
of the important speeches made by Comrade Xiaoping in 1992, the 
momentum of China's economic development has been very good. 
Political and business circles abroad are unanimous in their 
optimism about China's economic development, and foreign capital 
has been flowing into China at a rate never before seen. In 
regard to problems which occurred on the way forward, the 
Central Committee has taken a range of measures aimed at 
strengthening and improving macro-economic regulation and 
control to tackle them. These measures have yielded positive 
results, and we have gained more experience in how to promptly 
and appropriately deal with expected problems in the course of 
implementing reforms. By pooling the wisdom of the entire 
membership, the party at the Third Plenary Session of its 14th 
CPC Central Committee worked out a basic framework of socialist 
market economy, thus laying the ideological foundation for 
implementing the current reform policies. 
  Zhu Rongji stressed: The current rare historical 
opportunities should be firmly seized and highly valued in order 
to firmly advance the reforms we deliberated and wanted to 
implement for years but could not because conditions were not 
correct. If we fail to seize this opportunity to overcome the 
numerous difficulties in structural reform, then we will not be 
able to maintain sustained, rapid, and sound economic 
development and will not able to accomplish the second-step 
strategic objective of national socioeconomic development. 
  Zhu Rongji added: The preparatory work for the reform 
program for this year is quite adequate. Under the leadership 
of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
nucleus, the reform program was worked out by two task forces 
composed of talents and backbone personnel from various sectors 
who had conducted long, careful, and painstaking research and 
who have canvassed the views of all quarters. We have taken 
into full account the formidable difficulty and complexity which 
the current reform entails. It goes without saying that no 
pre-designed reform program is perfect; all we can do is 
constantly put it into practice, constantly sum up experience, 
and constantly make readjustments in the course of reform. As 
Comrade Xiaoping said: "The entire party and the nation must be 
told that it is a hard task. There are no perfect policies or 
methods. Facing us will be new situations and problems; we have 
to create experience on our own." "This requires us to be bold 
yet careful in every step we take, to sum up experience in a 
timely fashion, make readjustments as problems arise, and adapt 
according to the actual conditions." So long as we act 
according to the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's speeches, we will 
certainly be able to make reform a success. 
  Zhu Rongji pointed out: Currently, the main risk does not 
lie in reform itself, but in the overexpansion of investment in 
fixed assets which has gone beyond the capacity of the nation to 
build on the investment. The agricultural problem remains 
outstanding. Some comrades are keen on launching new projects; 
on expanding the scale of construction; and on vying with one 
another in chalking up faster growth rates, in displaying 
wealth, and in creating high consumption. However, they are not 
interested in improving economic returns, in practicing 
economics, in moving from the red ink into the black, and in 
improving management. They are not keen about promoting 
agriculture, improving the vegetable supply, developing the 
market, keeping prices under control, or taking care of the 
well-being of the broad masses. This situation must be changed. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Reform and development in 1994 entails 
heavy work. The people are concerned about it, and the world is 
looking at us. Whether or not we can effectively carry out this 
key battle of reform is a rigorous test. We must show great 
determination in decreasing the scale of investment in fixed 
assets, and must continue stabilizing and developing the rural 
economy. Comrade Xiaoping said in 1988: "For reform to 
succeed, it must be carried out under organized leadership and 
in a measured manner, otherwise everyone will go his own way and 
there will be chaos. What a terrible thing that would be!." 
"If the CPC Central Committee and State Council do not have 
authority, then the situation will be out of control. " 
"Macro-control must be based on what the central committee says 
will hold." Leading comrades at all levels and all party 
members must further unify their understanding, march in unison, 
work vigorously, and help each other to make the country 
prosperous. Party committees and governments at all levels must 
pay still more attention to reform, and principal leading cadres 
must stand in the forefront of carrying out the reform program. 
  In conclusion, Zhu Rongji said: We are convinced that under 
the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and under the correct 
leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin 
as the nucleus, we will successfully implement the decision 
adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and the reform program formulated at the Central 
Economic Work Conference through the common efforts of the 
entire party and whole nation, and will achieve still greater 
advances in economic development this year. 
  Leading comrades present at the conference were Li Lanqing, 
Li Tieying, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, and Ren Jianxin. Ding 
Guangen presided over the conference.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- A large benefit 
performance was held here today in support of the "Hope Project". 
  This is a program on the Chinese mainland aimed to help 
drop-outs in poor areas resume their school studies. 
  Together with Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, more than 10,000 
people watched the performance at the Great Hall of the People, 
which was relayed live by China Central Television all over the 
country. 
  China has about a million children who drop out from school 
each year because of poverty. Since the "Hope Project" was 
launched by the China Youth Development Foundation in 1989, it 
has received more than 200 million yuan in donations from home 
and abroad and helped 540,000 drop-outs return to school. 
  In the benefit show, artists presented songs, dances and 
other forms of art to express people's concerns about drop-outs 
and China's primary education. 
  All the performers gave their services free, and each of 
them 
also donated money to help at least one drop-out return to 
school. 
  Sponsored jointly by the Central Committee of the Chinese 
Communist Youth League, Ministry of Culture and Ministry of 
Radio, Film and Television, the benefit performance was expected 
to further publicize the "Hope Project" and enlarge its funds so 
as to help more drop-outs resume their schooling, said the 
organizers.

  [Text] Beijing, January 30 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Qian 
Qichen, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee and the State Council, today extended Spring Festival 
greetings to returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of these 
Chinese and Chinese nationals residing abroad. 
  Speaking at a reception held by the All-China Federation of 
Returned Overseas Chinese, Qian said that "at present, with an 
ever-growing economy, China enjoys political stability and good 
unity among the people of various nationalities and is making 
social progress." 
  China has also made new progress in its friendly relations 
with other countries, while the Chinese people have enhanced 
their friendship with the people in the rest of the world, said 
Qian, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the party 
Central Committee. 
  He praised returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives for 
plunging themselves into China's reform, opening up and 
modernization drive, and making great contributions to the 
country's social development and progress. 
  He described Chinese nationals residing abroad as the most 
"active and zealous force" for promoting opening up and economic 
and trade cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and 
other countries. 
  "They have made great contributions to the expansion of 
friendly ties between China and the countries they reside in and 
to the prosperity of their motherland," Qian told the gathering 
of 1,200 people. 
  He quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying that bringing into full 
play the role of Overseas Chinese and foreigners of Chinese 
origin serves as a "unique opportunity" for China to achieve 
tremendous development. 
  The present international and domestic situations have 
provided a rare favorable opportunity for China to develop, he 
said, noting "it is possible that the world will usher in a 
relatively long period of peace. 
  "The economic vitality of the Asia-Pacific region has 
continued to rise, providing favorable conditions for China's 
economic expansion," he said. 
  "Achieving the sacred cause of China's reunification is a 
common aspiration of the entire Chinese people, including our 
compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, as well as Overseas 
Chinese," he said. 
  The vice-premier said that the Chinese Government and people 
are committed to and can certainly promote the country's 
peaceful reunification in line with the principle of "one 
country, two systems." 
  He described China as a major force for maintaining peace 
and 
stability throughout the world. "We will, as always, pursue an 
independent policy for peace and persist in expanding friendly 
and cooperative relations with other countries on the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence," he said. 
  "We will also continue to make positive efforts to establish 
a peaceful, stable, fair and rational new international order," 
Qian added.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yu Changhong (0060 7022 3163)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Jan (XINHUA) -- Peng Peiyun, state 
councillor and minister in charge of the State Family Planning 
Commission, recently pointed out: We must strictly control 
population growth while going all out to develop the economy. 
We must fully understand that family planning is the 
indispensable condition for realizing our second and even third 
phase strategic objectives, and we must ensure a good job in 
family planning, monitoring and handling it in the general 
climate of social and economic development so as to create a 
good population environment for China's socialist modernization 
drive. 
  Thanks to extensive, thoroughgoing family planning, China 
has 
been able to effectively control its excessive population growth 
during the peak birth period in recent years. However, due to a 
large base figure, China is still facing a grim situation in 
birth control, and it is urgent matter to build a family 
planning structure in line with China's socialist economic 
structure. As far as this issue is concerned, Peng Peiyuan 
discussed several aspects of family planning work at the sixth 
national demography seminar that ended yesterday: 
  -- To continue to strictly control population growth remains 
the top priority of China's family planning work. The 
development of family planning is uneven across the country, and 
the birth rate in some regions shows no sign of decrease. As 
outdated beliefs regarding birth still exist among some cadres 
and masses, and their practical problems remain unsolved, the 
birth rate can pick up at the slightest relaxation of efforts. 
In addition, some grass-roots units have concealed and failed 
to report new births, and new circumstances and problems 
concerning birth control have also occurred in the course of 
establishing a socialist market economy. Therefore, we should 
fully recognize the protracted, arduous nature of family 
planning work, accurately assess the results in population 
control, and do everything possible to lower the birth rate. 
  -- China is also facing an arduous task in improving 
population quality. Of the more than 50 million disabled in the 
country, more than 10 million were born with deformities; there 
are now 4.17 million disabled children under 14 with birth 
defects, accounting for more than half of all disabled children; 
there are also 180 million illiterates or semi-illiterates in 
the country; and of every 1,000 newborns, 13 suffer from birth 
defects. Over 400 million people are living in iodine-deficient 
areas, which could cause the birth of tens of millions of 
mentally retarded children by 2000 if the problem was not 
solved. Therefore, we must understand that good prenatal care, 
sound rearing of children, and good education are the 
prerequisites for improving population quality as well as the 
essential conditions for solidifying a low birth rate; we must 
coordinate all sectors to energetically and effectively promote 
family planning. 
  -- Population structure problems must be solved. Due to a 
decline in the birth rate and a rise in average life expectancy, 
China is facing an aging population structure which has brought 
along a series of age related problems. In the structure of 
sex, the problem of a high ratio between males and females 
merits our keen attention. Therefore, efforts should be made to 
promote the establishment of a comprehensive pension and life 
insurance system as early as possible. Moreover, equality 
between men and women should also be advocated and policies and 
measures should be taken to lift women's social status. 
  -- Urbanization must be advanced in a planned way. Since the 
policy of reform and opening up was instituted, China's 
population mobility has increased and urbanization has 
accelerated. This trend will grow continually throughout the 
nineties. We should encourage and guide the surplus rural labor 
force to flow in an orderly manner between regions and to 
gradually transfer to job vacancies in nonfarming sectors, 
thereby bringing into play the positive impact of population 
mobility. This is also an important issue that has a close 
bearing on China's economic development and social stability. 
  Speaking in her capacity as chairwoman of the China 
Demography Society, Peng Peiyun also urged demographers to do 
more practical work and provide information and consultation for 
departments concerned. The new term of the society's officials 
also appointed Song Jian, state councillor and minister in 
charge of the State Science and Technology, and seven other as 
advisers.

  [Text] Disgraced Chinese party chief Zhao Ziyang has 
expressed the wish to make further contributions to reform. 
According to a source who met him in his Beijing house 
recently, the former general secretary, 74, pays very close 
attention to progress in the economy. "Mr Zhao is heartened that 
most of the reforms he advocated before the June 4, 1989, 
crackdown have been revived," the source said. "He believes the 
reforms will succeed." 
  He quoted Mr Zhao, a former party boss of Guangdong, as 
saying: "Recent developments in the province are very 
meaningful." The source added Mr Zhao had in subtle fashion 
expressed a desire to resume his work, at least on the economy. 
He clearly believed he had a role to play after patriarch Deng 
Xiaoping leaves the scene. 
  According to former Zhao aides who met him recently, the 
ex-party chief is in very good physical and mental health. He 
plays golf two to three times a week and sometimes walks his dog 
in the downtown alley where he lives under police guard. "He is 
not bitter about his downfall and he has reminded his friends 
more than once that `whatever has happened to me (since 
mid-1989) might not be that bad after all'," said another 
source. "His mood has been good since the middle of last year, 
and sometimes he holds forth on topics like the economy for an 
hour without stopping," the source said. 
  Mr Zhao's friends said his daughter and son-in-law lived 
with 
the former leader, whose wife, however, had recently been 
admitted to hospital. They said Mr Zhao had been pleased that 
his youngest son, a businessman formerly based in the United 
States, had returned to China on regular business trips. 
  It is understood the younger Mr Zhao, who travels on an 
American passport, spent most of his time in Guangdong and 
Hainan, and that he had visited Taiwan more than once for 
business reasons. "Soon after my departure from office, there 
was talk about investigation into the business activities of my 
children," Mr Zhao Ziyang reportedly said. "It turns out they 
have been law-abiding businessmen after all."

discussion with its workers and technicians. He said: "Through 
updating technology within a short period of two years, the 
Tangshan Iron and Steel Company has improved its efficiency, 
which usually cannot be attained by a newly built plant in five 
years. The development of an enterprise must be based on 
continual technical progress. Technical upgrading should be 
carried out continually and every year, not at intervals of 
several years or decades. Special attention must be paid to 
continually using new technologies and developing new products. 
From now on, in the entire operational process of enterprises, 
it is necessary to always give top priority to upgrading 
technology. Enterprises should keep up with the development of 
new technologies at home and abroad, and should use a number of 
new technologies every year. The worth of an enterprises should

"Person in Charge of Complaints Office of Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission Says Rights of Party Members and the 
Masses To Make Accusations and Complaints Should Be Defended"] 
  [Text] The "Regulations for CPC Discipline Inspection 
Organs Handling Accusations and Complaints," which was published 
in this newspaper of 3 September 1993, evoked positive 
repercussions in society. In an interview with this reporter 
some days ago, the person in charge of the Complaints Office of 
the Central Discipline Inspection Commission responded to a 
number of relevant questions raised by the masses. 
  When this reporter asked the official how discipline 
inspection offices process accusations and complaints against 
party members, he said: According to the "Regulations," 
discipline inspection offices have a duty to handle accusations 
and complaints against party members or party organizations 
which violate the party constitution, intra-party regulations, 
and the party's lines, principles, policies, and decisions, and 
against those party members who abuse their powers for personal 
gain or corrupt the party's work style. Specifically, everyone 
is allowed to send to discipline inspection organs reports 
against those party members or party organizations that distort 
or refuse to implement the party's lines, principles, and 
policies in violation of political discipline; those who refuse 
to follow the party's decisions or to accept the job assigned by 
the party in violation of organizational discipline; those who 
do not abide by the state financial laws and regulations in 
violation of financial and economic discipline; those who do not 
act in accordance with relevant policies in foreign-related 
dealings in violation of the discipline relating to foreign 
affairs; those who perpetrate economic crimes, including 
practicing graft; and those who are overly bureaucratic, neglect 
their duties, abuse their power for personal gain, bend the law 
for the benefit of their relatives and friends, harbor evildoers 
and cover up evil deeds, employ trickery, and are morally 
degenerate. According to the "Regulations," the discipline 
inspection offices also tackle appeals lodged by party members 
or party organizations against party disciplinary punishment or 
other punishment meted out to them by discipline inspection 
offices. "Party disciplinary punishment" refers to five 
disciplinary measures against individual party members and to 
punishment of convicted party organizations by reorganizing or 
disbanding them. In addition, the discipline inspection offices 
as supervisory organs within the party also address problems 
concerning party discipline and the party's work style including 
opinions, suggestions, enquiries, and reports against the people 
concerned. 
  Regarding the rights and duties of the persons involved, the 
official said: The six rights and three duties stipulated in 
the "Regulations" give, through the process of making 
accusations and complaints, concrete expression to the citizens' 
rights and duties stipulated in the constitution and to the 
party members' rights and duties stipulated in the party 
constitution and in the "norms [zhun ze 0402 0463]." No 
organizations or individuals are allowed to prevent the persons 
involved to exercise these rights; neither are any persons 
involved allowed to refuse to perform their duties. As required 
by the "Regulations," we must protect the accuser and earnestly 
investigate and handle retaliation cases; on the other hand, we 
must safeguard the accused's rights and interests and expose and 
deal with frame-up cases. 
  When asked about measures taken by the discipline inspection 
offices to protect informants, the official said: Discipline 
inspection offices at all level take the following measures 
according to the party constitution, the "norms," and the 
"Regulations": One, keep the informant and his report secret. 
The person to whom the case is assigned is required not to leak 
the informant's name and his report to any irrelevant people, 
and if he does, he will be investigated to determine his 
liabilities. Two, no unauthorized attempts are allowed to find 
out the anonymous letter writer. Support and encouragement 
should be given to those informants who reveal matters as they 
stand. Even if what they expose does not agree with facts, no 
organizations and individuals are allowed to take disciplinary 
action against them so long as they do not intentionally invent 
a story to frame up others. No unauthorized efforts are allowed 
to identify the handwriting of the anonymous letter. If the 
accusation does not tally with the facts, we should find out 
whether the accuser has made a mistake or has tried to frame up 
others on purpose. In the former case, we should clarify the 
facts among a limited number of people to eliminate the harm 
done to the accused and exhort the accuser to make no more 
similar mistakes in future; in the latter case, we must make 
investigations, which should be conducted by the units handling 
the accusation with the assistance of relevant party 
organizations, to determine the accuser's liabilities.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xu Rujun (1776 1172 0193), and </F>
XINHUA reporter Liu Siyang (0491 1835 2254)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- The national conference 
on the education of party members -- which opened in Beijing 
today -- stated that, while developing the socialist market 
economy, earnest efforts must be made to intensify and improve 
the education of party members so that, with higher qualities in 
various fields, they will fight to achieve the new historical 
missions. 
  The conference is sponsored by the Organization Department 
and the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee. 
  It has been reported that the education of party members has 
constantly been intensified since the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee. In recent years, in light of 
the central committee's plan and requirements, the vast number 
of party members have been systematically educated on the "three 
basics" -- the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong 
Thought, the party's basic line, and basic party knowledge -- as 
well as on the current situation and policies, party conduct and 
party discipline, the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and guidelines laid down by the 14th National 
Party Congress. As a result of the educational courses, party 
members, with higher political awareness, have given full scope 
to their roles as vanguards and role models, and party 
organizations have continued to demonstrate their roles as 
fighting fortresses. The educational courses for party members 
have powerfully quickened and promoted the development of 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. 
  To keep pace with the new situation, the current conference 
on the education of party members stated that the general 
requirement for party members' education under the new 
conditions is to firmly adhere to the guidance provided by Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line; focus on economic 
construction; improve the quality of party members in all 
fields; amplify the militancy of party organizations; and 
mobilize all party members to work hard to build a socialist 
market economic system, achieve the second-step strategic 
objectives, and carry out all strategic missions put forth by 
the 14th National Party Congress. 
  Liu Yunshan [0491 0061 1472], deputy head of the Central 
Propaganda Department, said at the conference that education for 
party members today and in the future should give priority to 
three things: First, it should complete the assignment to arm 
the whole party with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all 
levels must earnestly implement the central committee's decision 
of studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, and continue to organize the vast number of party 
members to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping until results have been achieved. While making 
sure that grass-roots party members will properly study the 
book, special attention should be paid to study among party 
member-cadres, especially party member-leading cadres. Second, 
it should persist in educating party members on party spirit. 
Party members must be educated to merge communist ideals with 
the ideals shared by people throughout the country at the 
present stage, and to rally and guide the vast number of people 
to work hard together to expedite reform and construction; to 
merge the objective of serving the people wholeheartedly with 
the work of developing the socialist market economy; to 
cultivate lofty moral sentiments by fostering communist ethics 
as well as social and professional ethics; and to preserve and 
carry forward the party's fine traditions through strictly 
abiding by the party's disciplinary rules while embarking on 
exploring new fields, bringing forth new ideas, opening up to 
outside world, and enlivening the economy. Leading cadres must 
set personal examples in order to make education on party spirit 
a success. Third, it should educate party members on basic 
knowledge of the socialist market economy, modern science, and 
modern general knowledge. This educational project is an urgent 
assignment which must be properly accomplished. 
  In conclusion, Liu Yunshan said: There are now extremely 
good opportunities for educating party members. It is to be 
hoped that all party committees and departments in charge of 
party members' education will earnestly strengthen their 
leadership over party members' education, have a firm grip of 
the project, place it high on their agendas, and accomplish it 
firmly and meticulously so that a new situation in party 
members' education can be created with a new approach. 
  Zhao Zongnai, deputy head of the Central Organization 
Department, chaired today's meeting. Present at the meeting 
were Lu Feng, Zhang Quanjing, Fu Jie and other comrades in 
charge of relevant central departments; and persons in charge of 
organization and propaganda departments and discipline 
inspection commissions of party committees of provinces, 
autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central 
government's jurisdiction, and some cities.

"Migrant Worker Rush in Chinese Mainland Exposes Many Social 
Problems"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 23 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The 
Chinese New Year is drawing near. In various mainland 
provinces, rural laborers have began to move back to their home 
villages like an ebbing tide in order to hold family reunions. 
In this period, such means of transportation as trains and 
buses are getting extremely crowded, and this has become a 
special scene at the turn of the year. It is expected that 
before and after the Spring Festival, over 10 million migrant 
workers will travel. 
  Why is there such a special phenomenon? Individual income in 
the countryside is low, and young peasants always try to seek 
jobs and earn a bit more money as long as there are 
opportunities to enter the city. After the beginning of reform 
and opening up in the Chinese mainland, the southeast coastal 
provinces and areas got rich first, and the people's living 
standards became much higher. This stimulated the people in the 
interior provinces and regions. As the popular saying goes, 
"water flows downward and people hope to move upward." This is 
an inevitable phenomenon. In the final analysis, the movement 
of rural laborers arose because there was a labor surplus in the 
rural areas. At present, the rural working population in the 
Chinese mainland is about 450 million people, accounting for 74 
percent of the country's total labor resources. However, there 
is only some 1.4 billion mu of farmland, which requires only 200 
million laborers. Fortunately, the township and town 
enterprises arising in recent years have absorbed 110 million 
working people, thus substantially reducing the surplus labor 
force in the countryside. However, the surplus labor force in 
the countryside still stands at about 130 million. Peasants now 
spend three months on farming, one month on celebrating the new 
year holidays, and eight months on doing nothing. Such a 
description is quite true. Because there is too little land to 
support too many people, the peasants' income remains very low. 
Going out to seek jobs has become the main means of living for 
young peasants. 
  The emergence of the migrant laborer tides should be 
regarded 
as an inevitable phenomenon, but this also exposes the people's 
difficulties in seeking jobs and many problems in the field of 
labor management. Reportedly, a crowd of peasants recently 
gathered around Beijing's Chongwen Men, and there appeared a 
"labor market" where employers might select workers. However, 
many laborers from the countryside failed to find a job after 
waiting there for over two weeks or even one month. First, they 
were not well-informed, as they came from the countryside; 
second, they were not skilled workers and could not compete with 
other people in seeking jobs. As a result, they wasted time and 
money traveling back and forth, and also suffered psychological 
pain. Similar phenomena also exist in the "labor markets" of 
Shanghai and Guangzhou. So far, the authorities have not 
included migrant laborers in the scope of labor registration and 
distribution. This should not be regarded as an accidental 
oversight. 
  Migrant rural laborers also cause serious problems to 
transportation. Because of the large scale of population 
movement and the limited number of destinations, tremendous 
pressure is caused for the transport industry, which has long 
been the bottleneck of the economy. The movement of rural 
laborers also causes difficulties to urban management, public 
order and security, and public health. 
  In fact, migrant laborers are from the countryside, but they 
work all year round in cities and only return home for a number 
of days around the Chinese New Year. Some of them even bring 
their whole families to the city and do not return to the 
countryside for many consecutive years. Gradually, the migrant 
laborers have formed a unique community, and these people also 
have their special social status. Some sociologists point out 
that migrant laborers are not rural people in real terms, nor 
urban people in real terms. They are living in a "marginal" 
condition. They are living in cities, but they are not accepted 
by cities and do not achieve the social status of urban 
residents. When the economy cools down, they are the first to 
be forced to leave the cities and return to the countryside. 
However, they are no longer accustomed to rural work. According 
to statistics in some cities, over half of criminal cases in 
cities are related to migrant laborers from the countryside. 
Maybe this is because they are not accepted and admitted by 
cities, and their livelihood has no guarantee. Some cities tell 
all institutions not to hire new laborers from other provinces, 
and reject migrant laborers. The correctness of such a practice 
is open to question. 
  It seems that in order to reduce the negative effects of the 
movement of over 10 million rural laborers, the authorities must 
formulate corresponding control and guidance measures. For 
example, the urban household registration system should be 
reformed; institutions for providing consulting and guiding 
services to migrant laborers from the countryside should be set 
up; and people living in difficult conditions should be helped 
to return home; and opportunities should be given to educated 
and skilled laborers from the countryside. All these points are 
worth considering.

Siyi (0242 0934 5030): "China Completes Research on Current 
Crime"] 
  [Text] Beijing 28 Jan (XINHUA)--A key national project in 
science and technological research that lasted five years, 
research on the issue of present-day crime, was completed not 
long ago by China's public security system. 
  The research report is some 5 million characters long, and 
systematically analyses, studies and discusses the conditions of 
crimes, their causes, and development trends, as well as 
measures for prevention and control of crime in present-day 
China. 
  A committee for appraising and deliberating comprised of a 
dozen or so experts and scholars from political and law science 
circles and representatives from 20 provinces and municipalities 
started appraising the result of the key scientific research 
project of in the national seventh five-year plan for philosophy 
and social sciences. 
  A Ministry of Public Security spokesman said that the public 
security system had used over 1,000 researchers for this 
scientific research project, and gained voluminous first-hand 
materials in the investigation and study of some 10,000 cases 
and 300-some police substations for three consecutive years. 
  He said that all this was of important value to reinforcing 
the fight against criminal phenomena and pushing forward China's 
scientific and theoretical study in criminology. 
  The spokesman said that Chinese public security 
organizations 
had already established a microcomputerized system for 
collection, processing, storage of and inquiries about 
information regarding criminal data and initiated a number of 
specialized as well as academic organizations for criminological 
study. 
  At the appraisal meeting, Bai Jingfu, vice minister of 
public 
security stated that through investigation and study, the 
Chinese leadership tier gained some new understanding of laws 
governing criminal activities, made forecasts about the 
tendencies of crimes in China prior to the year 2000, and set 
out its ideas.

(4423 1660): "Peasant from Yantai Murders Someone With 
Explosives To Resist Tax Payment"] 
  [Text] Liu Shu [0491 2885], a peasant from Yantai's 
Jianggezhuang Town, refused to pay tax every year since 1980; by 
1992, the amount of tax in arrears had accumulated to 470 yuan. 
  Shortly after tax-collecting work began in 1993, Liu Shu 
publicly announced that he would refuse to pay, while 
instigating other villagers to do the same, thus directly 
affecting the unfolding of tax collection in the village. To 
insure the smooth operation of tax-collecting work, town Vice 
Governor Zhang Xiao [1728 2400] came to the Guanghe Village's 
village committee office, accompanied by comrades from the 
county public security bureau and town police substation. Then 
they sent for Liu Shu. Together with the village committee 
Director Xu Shiyou [1776 0013 0645], they did ideological work 
face-to-face with Liu Shu, hoping that he would promptly pay the 
arrears. Liu Shu rejected the criticism, while growing very 
angry; he flung abuse at the vice town governor as well as the 
cadre and policemen from the public security bureau and police 
substation. Quickly, Zhang Xiao and the public security bureau 
cadre and policemen made a decision: Zhang Shu must immediately 
go home to get the money to pay the tax, otherwise, he would be 
solemnly dealt with according to the relevant law. The 
ferocious Liu Shu became mad and pretended that he would go home 
and fetch the money. When he arrived home, he got some 
explosives (7 kg), which he had concealed in his house, wrapped 
them around his body with a fuse, and covered them with his 
overcoat. At around 1020, Liu Shu returned to the village 
office, and suddenly sprang up at the town Vice Governor Zhang 
Xiao, holding him tight, then he pulled the fuse.... 
  The explosives erupted, and Liu Shu had his body blown to 
pieces, with his crime and hatred for the times, and Vice 
Governor Zhang Xiao unfortunately died at his post. In 
addition, three other public security cadre and policemen along 
with a villager were badly wounded. The 20-square-meter village 
committee office was flattened, shreds of the TV set, bills, 
renminbi banknotes, clothes and caps of the deceased, and blood 
and bones from the corpses...were thrown more than 100 meters, a 
really tragic sight.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, 20 Jan (XINHUA) -- The State Planning 
Commission held "Discussion Meeting on Economic Planning for the 
Bo Hai Region" in Hebei's Tangshan City from 17 to 19 January. 
  At the meeting, State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua 
pointed 
out: To develop the regional economy, we should formulate an 
overall and comprehensive plan along the thought of linking up 
the local economy while opening up a channel to the outside 
world by capitalizing on geographical, resources, market, and 
industrial edges of different but economically related provinces 
and cities in the region. We should exploit the vitality that 
could be generated through different localities supplementing 
each other's advantages. Regional economy has become a new 
pattern in our country's economic development. 
  Leading comrades from provinces and cities including Hebei, 
Liaoning, Shandong, Shanxi, Beijing, and Tianjin, as well as 
from the ministries of railways, communications, power industry, 
coal industry, metallurgical industry, chemical industry, and 
agriculture, attended the discussion meeting. 
  It was the fourth regional economic planning meeting 
following those held in 1992 and 1993 for southwest China and 
part of south China, Chang Jiang Delta and Chang Jiang regions, 
and northwest China. 
  In his speech, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua summed up the 
principle of our country's regional economic planning as overall 
planning; mutual cooperation; supplementing each other's 
advantages; equality and mutual benefit; gearing toward markets; 
domestic and international cooperation; rational division of 
work; and joint development. 
  Zou Jiahua pointed out: The pan-Bo Hai region has superior 
location advantages. It is the center of the northeast Asian 
economic sphere and the most convenient access to the sea for 
our country's north, northeast, and part of northwest regions. 
The region leads the country in comprehensive scientific and 
technological advantages, with the number of institutes of 
higher learning and scientific and technological personnel in 
the region constituting about one-third of the nation's total. 
The region holds advantages in its energy and heavy and 
chemical industries, with coal, oil, and steel production making 
up 40 percent of the nation's total production. The region is 
also our country's aviation and communications center, and has 
the most concentrated network of railways, roads, large ports, 
and expressways. The Bo Hai region is situated in our country's 
political center, and is also our country's economic center. 
Quickening the region's economic development plays a decisive 
and strategic role in the overall national economic development. 
  Zou Jiahua said: These advantages are not of a specific 
locality but of the entire region. Therefore, when developing 
the region's economy, we should not go separate ways and 
duplicate development efforts. On the contrary, localities 
should supplement each other's advantages and support one 
another in their cooperation to create a new productive force. 
When formulating the regional economic development plan, it is 
necessary to break down restrictions of administrative 
divisions. Localities should make joint and long-term plans for 
development projects of common concern and benefits within the 
region. We should impose a certain binding force for this type 
of plan, and require various localities to carry out their 
duties in cooperation with one another. Meanwhile, we should 
integrate the plan with national plans and incorporate it into 
the country's long-term development program. 
  Zou Jiahua also stressed the following key points for the Bo 
Hai regional development plan: 
  -- Overall consideration should be given to the region's 
transportation and communications networks, particularly the 
construction of principal transportation and communications 
facilities. This is a most urgent matter, and yet unable to be 
undertaken individually by various localities. We should focus 
our tasks on building coal, foreign trade, and passenger 
transportation facilities. It is necessary to develop a 
comprehensive sea, land, and air transportation network based 
principally on energy and foreign trade transportation services 
in the region, as well as a communications network system 
centered in Beijing and linked to the entire nation. 
  -- Energy resources as well as raw and semifinished material 
industries within the region should be developed jointly. Based 
on the overall need of national economic development and 
regional division of work, it is necessary to continue to 
strengthen the development of Shanxi's energy resource base. We 
should actively develop Kengkou power plant and increase the 
capability of transporting power from west to east. 
  -- The socialist market economic framework should be 
established. We should replace the divided and closed economic 
patterns with a regional, comprehensive, and open large market. 
Resources should mainly be disposed through the market. We 
must establish product markets and bring into play the region's 
advantages to establish the scientific and technological market, 
information market, and financial market. The regional market 
should be geared toward the country and the international 
markets of the northeast Asian economic sphere and pan-Pacific 
regions. 
  -- The problem of water shortage that restricts the region's 
economic development should be tackled effectively. It is 
expected that the Bo Hai region will be short of 15 billion 
cubic meters of water supply by the end of this century. It is 
necessary to make early preparations and quicken the project of 
piping water from south to north, so that advance progress may 
be made in establishing the region's water supply network. 
Meanwhile, we should strengthen water resources management and 
promote water conservation. 
  -- The tasks of aiding the rural poor and turning losses of 
industrial enterprises into profits should be effectively 
undertaken to drive the region's economy onto the path of 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Jianxing (2621 1696 5281) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Fu Gang (0265 0474)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- At today's national 
meeting on auditing work, State Councillor Li Guixian said: The 
Constitution stipulates that under the State Council's 
leadership, auditing organizations independently carry out 
supervising power according to law without interference from any 
other administrative organization, social group, or individual. 
The faster the drive of reform and opening up to the outside 
world is conducted, the more effective auditing supervision 
should be. 
  Li Guixian continued: Auditing supervision is of great 
importance in the socialist modernization drive. Whether or not 
the central authorities' macroeconomic regulation and control 
measures are conscientiously implemented depends on the 
supervision of supervision departments, and particularly 
auditing departments, at all levels, although auditing 
departments themselves do not formulate such measures. Auditing 
departments should supervise economic administrations, local 
governments, and state-owned enterprises and institutions in 
their implementation of state policies by auditing their 
financial management and affairs. Auditing departments should 
also reflect in a timely manner problems existing during the 
course of implementation to facilitate the implementation of the 
macroeconomic regulation and control measures adopted by the 
central authorities. 
  Li Guixian said: The focus of auditing work this year should 
be shifted to providing services to macroeconomic regulation and 
control. Therefore, in carrying out auditing supervision, 
attention should be paid to the following three aspects: First, 
auditing supervision over the state's financial revenue and 
expenditure should be strengthened. At present, our country's 
financial situation is relatively difficult but there is great 
potential to increase revenue and cut down expenditures. 
Auditing departments should deal with such problems as seeking 
departmental and regional interests regardless of financial and 
economic laws and disciplines. They should help financial, 
taxation, and other departments do a good job in managing and 
utilizing the state's funds. Second, auditing supervision over 
the departments in charge of state-owned assets should be 
strengthened. Some state-owned enterprises have serious 
problems including poor economic performance, incorrect 
statement of losses and benefits, and losses of state-owned 
assets. By auditing state-owned enterprises and departments in 
charge of state-owned assets, auditing departments should help 
them strengthen management, enhance economic returns, and ensure 
the maintaining and increasing of the value of state-owned 
assets. Third, auditing supervision over governmental 
departments in their financial revenue and expenditures should 
be strengthened. It is necessary to treat this task as an 
important matter in the anticorruption campaign and in building 
a clean government. Particular efforts should be made to 
strengthen financial audits of governmental organizations and 
law enforcement, judicial, and economic administrations. If 
squandering, wasting, and seeking private gains through power as 
well as arbitrary requisition of donations, exaction of fees 
from enterprises, and other unhealthy trends of trade and 
profession are found, serious measures should be taken.

  [Text] Yichang, January 29 (XINHUA) -- China has for the 
first time introduced the engineering supervision system, a 
common international practice, in the construction of the "Three 
Gorges Project", according to the Three Gorges Project 
Construction Committee. 
  So far, nine bid winners have been authorized to supervise 
the whole preparatory construction of the Three Gorges Project, 
taking the lead in China's supervision practice in the major 
water conservancy project construction. 
  According to the supervision contract, the supervisors will 
take up the overall administration of the quality and progress 
of the preparatory construction and control its cost. 
  They will be empowered to endorse payment checks, start and 
terminate project programs or have constructors do the work over 
again if it is not done properly. 
  The construction of many preparatory projects, including the 
building of the Xiling Chang Jiang River Bridge, are proceeding 
smoothly under the supervision. 
  The supervision system will help guarantee the quality of 
the 
project with proper speed and controlled cost, said a member of 
the Three Gorges Project Construction Committee.

<F P=106> [From "China Economic News" column: "The Main Points of the </F>
`Chang Jiang Strategy' Plan"] 
  [Text] It is learned that the State Planning Commission 
has recently worked out the main points of a new "Chang Jiang 
strategy" plan. The methods of specific implementation and main 
points are as follows: 
  --Establish an economic ring along the Chang Jiang which 
takes Pudong of Shanghai as the dragon head and covers eight 
areas and 28 large and medium-sized cities between Chongqing and 
the Chang Jiang Estuary. 
  --Speed up the construction of infrastructure and key 
projects in the region, including over 100 backbone projects 
with an investment amount of over 200 billion yuan each, such as 
the Shanghai Jinshan 1-million-metric ton oil refinery project, 
the Pudong international airport, the Shanghai sedan project 
with an annual production capacity of 300,000 cars, the Shanghai 
acetic acid standard project, the second-phase Qinshan Power 
Plant project, the Panzhihua nonferrous metal project, the 
Beijing-Shanghai express railway project, the Hubei sedan 
project with an annual production capacity of 300,000 cars, and 
the Three Gorges project. 
  --Quicken the pace of using foreign funds in areas along the 
Chang Jiang and diversify the fields in which foreign capital is 
used. Except for the pornography and gambling industries, which 
should be banned, and state-level telecommunications facilities, 
which are not open to the outside world, other fields may in 
principle utilize foreign capital, which is estimated at around 
$10 billion. 
  --Open the domestic market to foreign businessmen. Use 
foreign capital according to international practice, i.e. the 
BOT [Board of Trade] method, with foreign businessmen being 
responsible for investment, construction, and operation for a 
period of 15 years and the Chinese side purchasing the products 
manufactured by foreign-invested enterprises. 
  --Remove the "restricted areas." Given that state interests 
are not infringed upon, foreign businessmen should be allowed to 
invest in those trades they deem appropriate. 
  It is disclosed that, to implement the plan, the state will, 
between now and the year 2000, build a number of key projects in 
areas along the Chang Jiang and the scope of investment is 1,000 
billion yuan.

  [Text] Beijing, January 29 (XINHUA) -- No new fixed asset 
investment projects will be approved this year, China's State 
Council declared today. 
  It issued a circular to keep a tight rein on the country's 
fixed asset investments in 1994. 
  While affirming the achievements made in economic 
construction last year, the circular warns against the tendency 
in investment over-expansion caused by extended building scales 
and sluggish restructuring. 
  It points out that construction should focus on top-priority 
projects, while approval of new projects should be brought under 
strict control. In principle, no new projects will be approved 
this year, it adds. 
  The People's Bank of China should keep a close watch on the 
overall loans for fixed asset investment and where they go, 
while no banks are allowed to offer loans for any new project 
that is not approved by the State Council and the State Planning 
Commission, it says. 
  It also bans any extending of issues of bonds and securities 
and expansion of experimental scope of stock companies without 
authorization. 
  While focusing on badly needed housing, a tight rein must 
also be kept on development of real estate and building of 
development zones, it says. 
  It says that close attention should be paid to strengthen 
the 
guidance and standardized management of direct foreign-funded 
projects in order to encourage foreign investment in the 
domestic infrastructure facilities and basic industry. 
  The circular concludes that the leadership of the 
macro-control over fixed asset investment should also be 
enhanced to ensure a sustained, fast and healthy economic 
development in 1994.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Preferential Treatment for Farmers"] </F>
  [Text] The government's newly promulgated consumption tax 
will not apply to the farm machinery industry, according to the 
State Taxation Administration. 
  This decision reflects the government's preferential 
treatment for farmers, who need a stable rural market with few 
price fluctuations in agricultural-related products. 
  "Chinese farmers cannot afford a further swelling of price 
surges on the agricultural production materials this year," said 
an official with the administration. 
  Last year, the country's 14.5 percent inflation rate 
seriously hurt the improvement of farmers' real income, which 
chalked up a rise of only 2 percent. 
  As a result, the taxation administration hopes it can 
contribute to the government's macro control over the rural 
market as well as to the development of the rural economy, which 
is crucial to social stability, the official added. 
  Some domestic speculators are now taking advantage of the 
farmers, he said. Since the farmers do not have the latest 
information about the consumption tax, speculators have been 
profiteering by raising prices of farm machinery and blaming the 
need for the increase on the new tax. 
  Fearing further price increases, some farmers have been 
staging a buying spree since the last month of 1993, snapping up 
tractors, harvesters and other big farm machinery. 
  Official figures show that in 1993, the gross value of 
agricultural machinery owned by the country's rural residents 
hit nearly 125.4 billion yuan ($14.6 billion), up 3.9 percent 
from the previous year. 
  However, the amount of farmland that was ploughed by machine 
remained essentially the same over the two-year period. In 
1993, 51.4 million hectares were ploughed by machine, down 0.01 
percent from 1992. 
  Analysts say some farmers now believe they can protect their 
renminbi from further devaluation by purchasing agricultural 
machines, although some of their machines are already lying idle 
in their backyards. 
  In fact, farmers have become reluctant to use farm machines 
to help round out their field work, due to the rocketing prices 
of diesel oil and the lack of a machine-repairing network in the 
countryside. 
  Last year, some 110 million hectares of farmland were sown 
with grain. Of that, only 26 million hectares were sown by 
machine.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "No Snags In Buying Back FECs"] </F>
  [Text] The Bank of China has been smoothly buying back 
Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs) after the government 
announced at the end of last year that it would gradually 
withdraw the currency from circulation. 
  Although the national figure is not available, the Bank of 
China's Beijing branch had recalled more than 127 million yuan 
in FECs as of January 27. 
  The central bank announced on December 29 that the dual-rate 
exchange system would be unified on January 1 and that it will 
stop issuing FECs. 
  Although the Central Bank said existing FECs can still be 
used temporarily, some people misunderstood and thought FECs 
would be devalued or even become worthless 
  So they rushed to banks to exchange FECs for U.S. dollars, 
creating long queues in the two days following the central 
bank's decision. 
  The Beijing branch's daily withdrawal peaked at 15 million 
yuan in FECs, said an official with the branch. 
  The rush eased later when the central bank reiterated that 
FECs can be exchanged at the previous official rate of 5.8 yuan 
per dollar. 
  In order to withdraw the FECs as quickly as possible, the 
bank has simplified the exchange procedures. 
  Foreigners, overseas Chinese, and people from Hong Kong, 
Macao and Taiwan can exchange FECs for dollars by showing their 
passports and identification certificates. 
  In the past, they were allowed to return only 50 percent of 
the amount specified on the exchange memos they were given when 
converting foreign currency into FECs. 
  China introduced FECs in 1980 as a convertible version of 
the 
renminbi. The Bank of China issued nearly 2 billion yuan ($230 
million) worth of FECs. 
  Although FECs are supposedly equal in value to the renminbi 
yuan, they actually are worth about 30 percent more in the 
market. 
  The price of FECs has also fluctuated dramatically in the 
black market. 
  In the first three days after the central bank's 
announcement, the price of 1 yuan FEC equaled only 1.05 renminbi 
yuan. But now speculators must pay 130 or even 140 yuan ($15 or 
$16) for 100 FECs. 
  Despite the rising price, black market dealers are still 
enthusiastic about buying FECs since they can make money from 
the margin between the previous official rate and the current 
rate. 
  They can use ruses to exchange FECs for dollars at the 
previous official rate of 5.8 yuan. Then they can sell the 
dollars at the current rate of 8.7 yuan. 
  For example, if a speculator uses 14,000 renminbi yuan to 
buy 
10,000 yuan of FECs, he can get more than $1,724. 
  Selling the dollars at the rate of 8.7 yuan, he can get 
14,998 yuan. This leaves him with a profit of nearly 1,000 yuan.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yu Donghui (0151 2639 2547) and Xiao Rui (5618 </F>
3843): "An Official From the State Commission for Restructuring 
the Economic System Talks About the Structural Reform of 
State-Owned Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--How many 
workers of state-owned enterprises in China are unemployed? How 
to implement the system in which state-owned enterprises go 
bankrupt? How to make arrangements for the placement of 
unemployed workers following enterprise bankruptcy? How to 
control the current situation of heavy losses of state-owned 
assets? 
  At the news conference held by the State Council Press 
Office 
today, domestic and foreign reporters repeatedly asked officials 
of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System of 
China questions on the structural reform of state-owned 
enterprises, which is the key to China's economic reform this 
year. 
  As introduced by Hong Hu, vice minister of the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, the objective 
and orientation of state-owned enterprise reform in China is to 
set up a modern enterprise system. This year, the State Council 
will select 100 large and medium state-owned enterprises in 
China as experimental units to implement the new system and 
gradually transform the mechanism of state-owned enterprises in 
various forms according to different categories. At present the 
name list has not been fixed and is being discussed by the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economic System and the State 
Economic and Trade Commission. 
  Small state-owned enterprises will be transformed in such 
forms as leasing, contracting, selling, and leasing as well as 
renting out. Enterprises which are always in the red, which are 
unable to pay their debts, and which can never be reinvigorated 
will declare bankruptcy according to law. 
  According to statistics, from the end of 1988 to the first 
half of 1993, law courts at all levels in China accepted and 
heard 948 cases of all kinds of enterprise bankruptcy, of which 
480 have been wound up. 
  Hong Hu pointed out: To set up a modern enterprise system, 
touching on the reorganization of property rights is inevitable. 
The act of declaring enterprise bankruptcy according to law is 
an effective way to readjust the industrial structure and 
achieve the reorganization of property rights, but it is not the 
only way. He said: Since we cannot issue planned targets of 
bankruptcy to organs at lower levels, we cannot estimate how 
many enterprises will go bankrupt in the reform of state-owned 
enterprises. 
  Speaking on the placement of unemployed workers from 
state-owned enterprises in China, Hong Hu said: At present, the 
proportion of redundant personnel in the total number of 
employees in China's state-owned enterprises is from 15 to 20 
percent, and this proportion is subject to constant change due 
to changes in the situation of operation and production in these 
enterprises. Last year, the State Council worked out the method 
of making arrangements for the placement of redundant personnel 
in state-owned enterprises, and now the work has been started. 
  As stipulated in the method of unemployment insurance of 
state-owned enterprise staff and workers, which was formulated 
by the State Council last year, enterprises must withdraw 0.6 to 
1 percent of total wages earned by their staff and workers to 
set up unemployment insurance funds; and staff and workers 
employed by enterprises which go bankrupt, which are on the 
verge of bankruptcy, or which have stopped production for 
reorganization are covered by the unemployment insurance scheme 
so that the living of unemployed workers can be basically 
guaranteed. 
  The current situation of heavy loss of state-owned assets in 
China has also aroused much concern. Hong Hu said: The 
"Regulations on the Supervision of China's State-Owned 
Enterprise Assets" will be introduced soon, and we are now 
tackling such technical problems as how to make the regulations 
converge with the Company Law. 
  Hong Hu said: The introduction of the regulations has an 
important bearing on stopping the loss of state-owned assets 
during the current process of setting up a modern enterprise 
system, transferring property rights, and reorganizing 
enterprises.

  [Text] The Agricultural Bank of China will split into two 
banks before the summer harvest this year to separate the 
functions of policy implementation and commercial lending, a top 
bank official said. 
  The two banks will be the Agricultural Development Bank and 
the Agricultural Bank of China, said Ma Yongwei, president of 
the Agricultural Bank of China. 
  Ma said the move is in line with the government's decision 
to 
forbid State policy banks from providing commercial loans. 
  The Agricultural Development Bank will implement the 
government's policy of supplying subsidized loans to farmers, 
starting this summer. 
  Although the 15 years of economic reform have raised 
farmers' 
living standard impressively, granting them long-term, 
low-interest loans will continue to be a fundamental function of 
the government bank officials said. 
  Many agricultural projects involving crop production 
irrigation and technological development will continue to 
receive government- subsidized soft loans. 
  These kinds of projects usually need huge outlays but have 
slow returns and such loans are often considered highly risky by 
commercial banks. 
  Bank analysts say the creation of the Agricultural 
Development Bank is part of the government's efforts to maintain 
its strong backing of agriculture while encouraging banks to do 
their business according to more commercial practices. 
  They add that many villages remain undeveloped, even aside 
from problems such as slow growth of farmers' income, high 
inflation in general and skyrocketing prices of farming 
materials in particular, and the huge number of surplus rural 
labourers. But officials with the Ministry of Agriculture note 
that agriculture in China has its own character and in many ways 
is unlike agriculture in other countries. 
  After the summer harvest this year, the Agricultural Bank of 
China can still find its clients in the countryside for its 
commercial loans, they added. 
  The burgeoning rural industries, which grew by about 40 
percent last year, have already become the backbone of the rural 
economy. 
  Meanwhile, rural households' limited access to the markets 
requires the government to extend huge loans to its grass-roots 
commercial units each year to buy farmers' products. 
  Since rural industries and grassroots commercial units can 
soon see profits from their investment, they should no longer 
receive government-subsidized soft loans. 
  Starting this year, the Agricultural Bank of China will have 
to balance assets and liabilities and manage business risks. 
  Both the Agricultural Development Bank and the Agricultural 
Bank of China will be under the leadership of the People's Bank 
of China, the country's central bank. 
  Both will have to be guided by the Central Bank's credit 
quotas to help the government ensure its control over total bank 
lending, according to bank officials. 
  In response to the government's call for strong backing of 
agriculture, the Agricultural Bank of China raised its 
outstanding loans to 968 billion yuan ($111.26 billion) by the 
end of last year, up 176 billion yuan ($20.5 billion) from the 
previous year.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "40 New Aircraft for 1994"] </F>
  [Text] China's aircraft imports will remain buoyant this 
year on the wings of sustained economic growth, a top corporate 
manager says. 
  "We'll receive more than 40 planes for civil use this year 
from the United States and Europe," Ye Yigan, President of the 
China Aviation Supplies Corp (CASC), said in an interview with 
BUSINESS WEEKLY. 
  Most of the planes are made by the Boeing Co of the United 
States and Airbus Industrie, the France-based European 
consortium, Ye said. 
  The world's civil aviation generally grows twice as fast as 
the global economy. 
  "But China's civil aviation has grown by a larger margin," 
Ye 
explained. 
  "That means we will buy at least several dozen aircraft per 
year." 
  China has lowered its 1994 target for economic growth to 
between 8 percent and 9 percent from last year's 13 percent. 
  However, the demand for civil aircraft remains brisk, 
especially with the mushrooming of local airlines. 
  Ye has said that China's imports of aircraft have averaged 
nearly $2 billion annually over the past several years. 
  China Aviation Supplies Corp, the country's leading trader 
in 
aircraft and ground equipment, has imported more than $10 
billion worth of aircraft since 1980. 
  The company is the designated main importer of civil 
aircraft, engines and other equipment, although a number of 
airlines can buy certain products from overseas by themselves. 
  For example, Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China 
Southern Airlines can import some spare parts through their own 
trading arms. 
  Economists said China should retain unified management of 
aircraft imports, although the industry is being decentralized 
some. 
  Ye said the construction of local spur lines was in full 
swing, generating a great demand for short- and medium-range 
aircraft. 
  Many international aircraft makers are vying for sales and 
local manufacture of their planes. 
  Ye said China would give priority to buying locally-made 
planes if prices are reasonable. 
  He added that China is choosing appropriate partners for 
local production of aircraft, but he declined to give details. 
  Ye said competition among foreign companies for a share of 
China's local airline manufacture is tough. 
  China is one of the world's fastest growing markets for 
civil 
aviation, while many developed countries and regions remain 
bogged down by stagnant economies. 
  Imports of ground equipment will also continue growing, Ye 
said. 
  Last year China Aviation Supplies Corp signed $3.2 billion 
worth of contracts for imports of aircraft and related 
facilities. About $2.5 billion of the goods have been delivered. 
  Ye said the recent normalization of Sino-French relations 
will help improve China's business with Airbus Industrie. 
  "We will further develop and improve relations with the 
company in the future," he said. 
  Ye pointed out that if Airbus Industrie completes scheduled 
deliveries this year, it will have provided China with 17 planes 
altogether.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zou Qingli (6760 3237 7787)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Civil Aviation 
General Administration of China [CAGAC] today issued a 
certificate of quality to the Yun-8 civil cargo plane developed 
and manufactured by the Shaanxi Aircraft Manufacturing Factory 
under the Aviation Industries of China. This indicates that for 
the first time, an aircraft model developed and manufactured by 
China has qualified for civil aviation. 
  Obtaining a certificate of quality according to the rules of 
airworthiness is indispensable for any aircraft model to gain 
permission for civil aviation. China has been batch producing 
the Yun-8 since 1980 and added them to its military equipment. 
In 1989, the former Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics 
Industry and relevant departments decided to provide Yun-8 
planes to airline companies as cargo planes and demanded that 
the original model be improved and rebuilt so that it would meet 
various civil plane requirements. By the end of 1989, the 
Shaanxi Aircraft Manufacturing Factory officially applied to the 
CAGAC for a certificate of quality for the improved model of 
Yun-8 plane. 
  Over the past four years, the CAGAC airworthiness department 
has conducted serious examinations of the Yun-8 civil cargo 
plane and its Chinese-built engine and propeller, according to 
the relevant Chinese civil aviation regulations. China's 
aviation industries have invested considerable capital in the 
organization of the Shaanxi Aircraft Manufacturing Factory and 
relevant enterprises and have conducted a lot of analyses, 
experiments, and test flights to check the aircraft's 
airworthiness. The Yun-8 civil cargo plane's certificate of 
quality has opened up a bright future for itself in the civil 
air cargo service market. This medium-range cargo plane, built 
into a medium-sized model, has a maximum loading capacity of 16 
metric tons of consolidated cargo or 20 metric tons of bulk 
freight. The plane has excellent taking-off and landing 
functions, which allow it to take off or land on airstrips, 
grasslands, gravel, or sandy roads. Two Jiefang brand trucks 
can directly drive into the plane's spacious cargo bay from its 
back door.

  [Text] Beijing, January 31 (XINHUA) -- The Ministries of 
Public Security, Construction and Agriculture as well as the 
State Commission for Restructuring the Economy have started 
surveys as a preliminary step to reforming the system of 
household registration in small towns and cities. 
  The reform is aimed at gradually abolishing the distinction 
between the agricultural and non-agricultural populations, which 
is now rigidly drawn under the current system of household 
registration. 
  In order to control the expansion of big cities, China 
divided its population into agricultural and non-agricultural in 
the 1950s. Under this system, those people registered as members 
of the agricultural population could not get grain and 
non-staple food rations and could not be given housing and jobs 
in urban areas. 
  But since the country started to adopt the policy of reform 
and opening to the outside world many rural people have become 
workers in industrial or service enterprises in nearby towns. 
By the end of 1993 there were 116 million farmer-turned 
workers. Because of the old system of household registration, 
however, these people were still regarded as members of the 
agricultural population, in spite of the fact that they no 
longer engaged in agricultural production. 
  Statistics show that China's gross non-agricultural product 
accounted for 75 percent of the gross national product in 1992. 
But 80 percent of the country's population was still registered 
as agricultural. Currently, the country's 20.79 million rural 
industrial enterprises are scattered among over 19 million 
villages. As a result, these enterprises find it difficult to 
engage in large- scale and high-tech production. Besides, the 
situation is not ideal as far as utilization of the land and 
transportation is concerned. Moreover, it is difficult to bring 
pollution under control in these circumstances. 
  Experts point out that it is now necessary to reform the 
system of household registration to encourage farmers to enter 
small towns to engage in various kinds of business, thus 
promoting the development of small towns throughout the country.

  [Text] Hohhot, January 30 (XINHUA) -- Baotou, once known as 
the "grassland steel town", is emerging as a multi-industry 
manufacturing center in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region, after a decade-long reshuffling of its industrial 
structure. 
  In 1993, the city's industrial production increased 20.92 
percent over 1992 to reach a record 11.89 billion yuan, making 
it the second Chinese city in the ethnic minority area that 
boasts an annual industrial production of over ten billion yuan, 
city officials in charge of industry said. 
  Equally encouraging, said the officials, was that industrial 
enterprises of the city are running with better economic 
efficiency. By the end of last November, they produced a total 
2.145 billion yuan in profits and taxes, almost 136 percent 
higher than in the same period of 1992. The comprehensive 
economic index of the city also climbed by 42.9 percent in the 
same period. 
  However, a subtle but more significant change was that the 
domination of the economy by centrally owned enterprises has 
lessened, and local industrial ventures, as well as the private 
and rural industrial sectors, are playing a more and more 
important role, the officials pointed out. 
  In 1993, industrial enterprises owned by the city produced a 
turnover of 5.565 billion yuan, exceeding for the first time the 
turnover of enterprises owned by the central and the regional 
governments. 
  Though heavy investment by the central government in iron 
and 
steel and other heavy industries boosted the former marketing 
place of furs in the grassland region into a major industrial 
town in the 1950s, it inevitably caused an inborn weakness of 
local industry and the service sector, the officials said. 
  From 1990 to 1993, the city had pumped 310 million yuan into 
the local industry sector. In pursuing a policy of allowing 
more bankruptcy and takeover of enterprises, it has also turned 
806 small and medium-sized enterprises to collective or private 
operation through renting and auctions. 
  It also encouraged the forming of 847 shareholding companies 
and 30 enterprise groups, which are believed to have a better 
economic performance. 
  Thanks to the policy weight on rural and urban community 
industry by the government, the two sectors have become a major 
force in coal, metallurgy, construction materials, farm products 
processing, construction and transport, employing more than 
100,000 people. 
  In 1993, rural and urban community enterprises had a 
turnover 
of 3.2 billion yuan, up by 139 percent over 1992. Eleven towns 
administered by the city reported an agricultural and industrial 
production value of more than 100 million yuan a piece last year. 
  Meanwhile, the officials said, the city's foreign-funded 
enterprises have increased to 157, involving an investment of 
120 million U.S. dollars by overseas businesses. 
  Household business and private enterprise have also been 
developing rapidly in the city. The former sector netted a 
turnover of 430 million yuan in 1993, and the latter 160 million 
yuan. 
  Large and medium-sized enterprises owned by the central 
government, including defense industry plants, did not lose 
their edge in the market-oriented economy. With their 
advantages in equipment and technology, many of them have been 
successful at developing new products and expanding their market 
share, the officials said. The city produced three million tons 
of steel last year.

<F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "Industries Bring Big Rewards to Rural </F>
Towns"] 
  [Text] About 10 per cent of China's rural towns have become 
relatively well-off thanks to the development of rural 
industries, say the latest statistics. 
  Reports from the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) say 4,989 of 
China's 50,000 towns achieved an agricultural and industrial 
output value of more than 100 million yuan (about $11.5 million) 
each in 1992. 
  Four hundred and thirty scored 500 million yuan (some $57.5 
million). 
  And 72 of them managed more than 1 billion yuan (some $115 
million). 
  Most of these well-off towns are in the coastal areas of the 
Southeast, where rapid economic growth has been achieved over 
the past decade. 
  According to the list worked out by the statistics bureau, 
944 rich towns are in East China's Jiangsu Province, 892 in 
Shandong also in East China, more than 500 in Zhejiang and 
another 425 in South China's Guangdong. 
  Experts said the survey showed up the disparity between the 
economic growth in different areas of China. 
  However, they stressed it was encouraging that 
100-million-yuan towns have sprung up in relatively poor areas, 
especially in Western parts of China, such as Guizhou Province 
and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which has two towns in the 
top-500. 
  This improvement was a result of the State's efforts in 
recent years to narrow the gap between China's east and west. 
  The State handed out 5,000 million yuan ($575 million) in 
loans last year to support the development of rural enterprises 
in inland areas, while local governments produced a number of 
preferential policies, said China Business Times. 
  As a result, the total annual output value of township 
enterprises in 20 inland provinces and regions was 400 billion 
yuan about $46 billion) last year, about 60 per cent more than 
1992. 
  China's top 10 towns are: Caigongzhuang in Tianjin; 
Qianzhou, Shengze, Luoshe and Zhouzhuang in Jiangsu; Beivao and 
Guizhou in Guangdong; Ninghai in Shandong; Xinzhaize in 
Liaoning; and Maqiao in Shanghai. 
  Experts say the growth of these wealthy towns is an 
indication of improvement in China's rural economy since the 
country began its reforms in 1979. 
  Statistics show more than 20 per cent of the rural 
population 
live in "100-million-yuan towns." 
  They also showed these towns produced half the country's 
agricultural output value and two thirds of its output value 
from rural industries. 
  Booming rural industries have been the biggest contributors 
to the development of the wealthy towns, the statistics show. 
  Non-agricultural production accounted for 88 per cent of the 
towns' total output value, about 24 percent higher than the 
country's average. 
  Meanwhile, a small number of them are close to becoming 
industrial centres, with 96 per cent of their wealth coming from 
non-agricultural production. 
  The output value of township enterprises in these prosperous 
communities made up 52 per cent of the country's total.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- In a circular it issued 
recently, the State Council General Office urges all local 
authorities to guide the flow of workers from rural areas during 
the Spring Festival. 
  The circular says: In recent years, owing to the flow of 
surplus labor in rural areas into nonagricultural sectors, the 
number of rural workers moving from region to region has grown 
constantly. While the sizable flow has promoted economic 
development in various regions and improved the people's 
livelihood, it has also given rise to problems which have upset 
production, living order, and social stability. The problems 
are particularly noticeable during the Spring Festival. 
According to departments concerned, the total flow of rural 
workers from region to region will soar dramatically this year. 
This being the case, all localities and departments concerned 
must work together to intensify preparations, tighten 
management, and take timely steps to guide the flow. 
  The circular urges all regions and departments concerned to 
provide the needed services and guide the flow by tightening 
macroscopic management and developing the labor market so that 
labor resources in rural areas can be developed, used, and 
rationally deployed; and so that, on the premise of ensuring 
agricultural development, surplus labor in rural areas can be 
guided to relocate rationally and flow in an orderly manner, and 
economic order in society can be maintained. 
  The circular says: All regions and departments concerned 
must attach importance to guiding the flow of rural workers 
during the Spring Festival. Leading comrades should be assigned 
to take charge of specific projects, and responsibilities should 
be fixed at various levels. Moreover, measures to guide the 
flow should be drawn up on the basis of past experience. 
Certain organizational, managerial, and publicity projects must 
be accomplished beforehand. Labor departments in all localities 
must have more efficient control over employment as well as the 
flowing labor force. They must always keep abreast of the 
situation and promptly notify government leaders and relevant 
departments. They must work with railway and communications 
departments in organizing round trips home for contract workers 
over the Spring Festival. In accordance with the volume of the 
flow and the destinations of rural workers, railways and 
communications departments must draw up transportation plans 
ahead of time and accomplish all the necessary preparations, 
including transportation arrangements. All regions and 
departments concerned must actively support the work of railways 
and communications departments. To assist departments concerned 
in guiding the flow of rural workers, public security 
departments must maintain security and order at railway stations 
and ports where rural workers gather, and firmly crack down on 
train and highway robberies and all other lawless conduct. 
  The circular stresses: During the Spring Festival, all 
regions and departments concerned must, as required by the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, intensify 
their work in studying and drawing up policies and measures to 
develop the labor force and labor market in rural areas while 
studying ways and means to promote agricultural development. 
Through intensive agricultural development, more township and 
town enterprises and tertiary industries should be established, 
the construction of small towns should be expedited, and surplus 
labor in rural areas should be encouraged to relocate locally. 
Meanwhile, we should continue to sum up and popularize the 
experiences of various regions in helping each others with labor 
services. In accordance with the needs of the labor market, we 
should, through the organized import and export of labor, guide 
surplus labor in rural areas to move rationally and in an 
orderly manner.

  [Text] Shenyang, January 30 (XINHUA) -- A nongovernmental 
charity organization to help poverty-stricken people -- the 
first of its kind in modern China -- was set up recently in 
northeast China's Liaoning Province. 
  On the opening day, the organization received some 1.25 
million yuan in donations from local private firms. 
  Yang Qingtian, head of the organization, said that this 
charity was sponsored by individuals and social groups who are 
keen to promote public welfare. 
  He noted that they will collect funds through various 
channels, set up some service organizations and help those who 
live in poverty and helplessness. 
  Xiao Zuofu, vice-governor of the province, said that 
charities are noble endeavours which mark the civilization of 
society, and the establishment of such an organization will 
undoubtedly promote the development of the social secrurity 
system. 
  In China, almost all social welfare organizations have been 
sponsored by governments over the past decades.

of fake cigarettes in public here today, as part of its 
nationwide crusade against production and marketing of 
contraband cigarettes. 
  Jiang Ming, head of CATM, said that cigarettes were a 
special 
kind of product, harmful to people's health. China has always 
practised strict control over the production and marketing of 
cigarettes, he said. 
  China has imposed a state monopoly and a high-tax policy on 
the tobacco industry to restrict its production scale. 
  However, according to the senior official, the illegal 
production and marketing of counterfeit cigarettes had become 
rampant in some localities in recent years, which prompted CATM 
to organize a joint crackdown on fake and smuggled cigarettes, 
with relevant departments of public security, customs and 
taxation. 
  Marked results had been achieved in the crackdown, said the 
administrator. Official statistics show that since 1993, CATM 
has tracked down 514,000 boxes (a box contains 50 cartons of 
cigarettes) of smuggled cigarettes, seized 64,000 boxes of 
counterfeit cigarettes and burnt in public 51,000 boxes of them. 
  The CATM has also smashed 50 production centers of fake 
cigarettes and banned over 100 wholesale markets which sold fake 
and smuggled cigarettes. 
  The administrator said that China practised the system of 
state monopoly on the tobacco industry as early as in the 1980s. 
A large number of locally run tobacco enterprises have been 
closed down since then, particularly in 1993. The year saw a 
sharp reduction of the nation's tobacco enterprises from 300 to 
100. 
  The CATM renewed permits for nearly 1,000 enterprises which 
are considered qualified for the production and marketing of 
cigarettes. 
  The official stressed that the system of tobacco monopoly is 
of great significance in checking illegal tobacco activities and 
it will further safeguard the interests of the nation and of the 
vast number of smokers.

<F P=106> [By reporter Tao Jie (7118 2638): "Gu Jinchi Goes to </F>
Universities and Scientific Research Units To Conduct 
Investigation and Study"] 
  [Excerpts] Soon after visiting 14 cities of the province, 
Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, who had 
assumed his post for merely three months, went to Liaoning 
University, Dongbei University, the Shenyang Institute of Metals 
Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Shenyang's 
Nanhu Scientific and Technological Development Zone to conduct 
investigation and study on 10 and 11 January. [passage omitted] 
  During the forums held at the two universities, Gu Jinchi 
analyzed why most schools still experienced strained supplies of 
funds even though Liaoning's growth of education funds was 
greater than the growth of revenues every year. He said: The 
major reason was that, under the old systems, establishment of 
schools has been duplicated in all localities, which leads to 
disperse of funds. In addition, the contingent of teachers is 
so large that it is disproportionate with the number of 
students. He held that only by deepening reform, can the 
difficulties in running schools be resolved. He called for 
concentrating efforts on making a few key universities 
successful. He expressed the hope that the universities reform 
will be conducted in better coordination with the economic 
development plan, and personnel with both scientific and 
technical ability and economic knowledge will be trained; that 
old professors will make more contributions to training 
outstanding young teachers; that teachers will attach importance 
to the political and ideological training of students and 
educate them to have enterprising spirit and strong sense of 
responsibility in addition to training them with specialized 
knowledge; and that greater steps will be made in the 
coordination between the scientific research of universities and 
enterprises. He said that the provincial party committee and 
government would make utmost efforts to support these two 
universities to enter the state's "211 project." 
  At the institute of metals research and the Nanhu Scientific 
and Technological Development Zone, Gu Jinchi said: The work 
that people throughout the province are most concerned about is 
how to accelerate Liaoning's economic development. They are 
worried about Liaoning's decline in the country's rating. He 
realistically analyzed the reason for this and said firmly: 
Liaoning used to rank second in the country thanks to its 
strength and was able to accomplish what other provinces and 
municipalities could not. For this reason, people called 
Liaoning the equipment department of the country. Things 
changed later, and some provinces and municipalities surpassed 
Liaoning. What should Liaoning do? The most important thing is 
to clearly understand science and technology as the primary 
productive forces, transform traditional industries with high 
and new technology, and continue to be able to accomplish what 
other localities are unable to. Only in this way, can it regain 
its magnificence. 
  Gu Jinchi repeatedly talked about transformation of 
scientific and technological achievements, urging efforts to 
give wider publicity to science and technology and scientific 
units to integrate science and technology with industrial 
production and trade. He hoped that a road to rapid 
development, rapid transformation, and good efficiency of high 
and new technology would be blazed. He urged for efforts to 
learn from the achievements and experiences of scientific and 
technological development zones to promote Liaoning's economic 
work. 
  Accompanying Gu Jinchi during the investigation and study 
activities were Wang Huaiyuan and Zhang Guoguang, deputy 
secretaries; and Xu Wencai, standing committee member and 
secretary general of the provincial party committee.

  [Text] "Firmly seize the opportunity, boost working 
enthusiasm, deepen reform, and accelerate development." This is 
what was particularly talked about by Gu Jinchi, secretary of 
the provincial party committee, when he conducted investigation 
and studies at Shenyang Railway Bureau and Shenyang Economic and 
Technological Development Zone on 12 January. 
  That morning, after listening to briefings given by Liu 
Zhijun, director of Shenyang Railway Bureau, and Ma Zengqing, 
secretary of the party committee of Shenyang Railway Bureau, Gu 
Jinchi extended congratulations and thanks, on behalf of the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government, to 
Shenyang Railway Bureau for its success in overcoming many 
difficulties and overfulfilling various state-assigned 
transportation targets last year. He said: The Shenyang Railway 
Bureau has done a good job in coordinating with the localities 
in carrying out their work, and has been involved in what the 
people are concerned with and worried about, cooperated with the 
local authorities in economic development, and made prominent 
contributions. He said: The development of the socialist market 
economy will bring new problems to the railway departments. For 
example, enterprises will set their production quota according 
to the market, and will make the transportation of cargoes more 
irregular. This will disrupt the planned arrangements of the 
railway departments, and urge railway departments to understand 
and accurately find out the pulses of enterprises and markets on 
their own initiative in order to meet the new changes in cargo 
transport. He called on the local authorities to cooperate with 
railway departments in public security, the improvement of work 
style of railway departments, and safe transportation work on 
their own initiative, and solve problems at any time. 
  During a forum with comrades of the Shenyang Development 
Zone 
in the afternoon, Gu Jinchi fully affirmed the work of the 
development zone, and expressed the hope that Shenyang city will 
study the kinds of technological transformation projects that 
should be introduced by a number of large and medium-sized 
enterprises with difficulties in Shenyang at present, the kinds 
of achievements that can be made by colleges, universities and 
scientific research institutes in the city, and which research 
projects are suitable for building in the development zone in 
line with its advantages of being a mother city near the 
development zone with a strong supporting capacity and numerous 
scientific and technical personnel. He suggested: After full 
preparations, the development zone may use the three existing 
types of foreign-funded enterprises as "match-makers," or ask 
the commercial counselors of embassies of some countries to 
serve as bridges, specially invite a number of foreign large 
commercial corporations and big financial groups to Shenyang to 
hold economic and technological talks, and make use of the 
favorable opportunity that all countries are trying to develop 
markets to bring in some big and high level items. He also 
said: At present, Shenyang will no longer be under direct 
provincial control in making economic and investment planning. 
All departments in the province should actively support the 
work of Shenyang city. The development zone should report on 
its own initiative its excellent situation of speedy development 
and the difficulties it has come across to the relevant 
provincial departments and bureaus, and may invite leading 
comrades of some departments and bureaus to participate in the 
leadership work of the development zone. 
  Gu Jinchi also inspected the main control room and the main 
communications station of Shenyang Railway Bureau, and Lifu 
Garment company, Zhongguang electronics company, and Tianxing 
computer equipment company, and three other types of 
foreign-funded enterprises in the Shenyang Development Zone. 
  Wang Huaiyuan and Zhang Guoguang, deputy secretaries of the 
provincial party committee; and Xu Wencai, member of the 
standing committee of the provincial party committee and 
secretary general, also accompanied Gu Jinchi during the 
investigation and studies.

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Desheng (1327 1795 3932): "The Work of </F>
Party Schools Should Suit the Needs of a Socialist Market 
Economy"] 
  [Text] "Efforts should be made to enhance the 
self-improvement of the leading party school bodies, to 
strengthen the construction of teachers' contingents in party 
schools, to foster the spirit of boldly scaling heights, and to 
apply the best research results of social sciences to suit the 
needs of establishing the systems of a socialist market 
economy." This is the substance of the speech given by Gu 
Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, at the 
forum sponsored by the provincial party committee on the morning 
of 13 January during his investigation and study tour to a party 
school. His speech aroused a sympathetic response among the 
trainees. 
  The forum was held in the meeting room on the third floor of 
the newly-built party school's building. The atmosphere was as 
warm as spring though the weather outside was extremely chilly. 
Cao Mingyuan, president of the provincial party committee party 
school, first delivered a report on the school's teaching 
reforms and on the construction of the school teachers' 
contingent. Gu Jinchi fully acknowledged the achievements scored 
by the school in this regard. He said: Party schools are in an 
important position to enhance party building. In order to 
enable various circles to pay attention to the work of party 
schools, we must have party committees at all levels to place 
the work of party schools on their important daily schedule, to 
conduct regular research, and to help party schools deal with 
their difficulties on the one hand and have party schools do a 
good job in self-improvement to win over the attention from 
various circles, on the other. Meanwhile, various localities 
and departments should also do their best to help party schools 
improve their school conditions and particularly and actively 
dispatch their trainees to the party schools in line with the 
demands. Gu Jinchi particularly stressed: The more heavy tasks 
the leading cadres have assumed, the more attention they should 
pay to participating the training of party schools. 
  In citing the teaching reforms of party schools, Gu Jinchi 
said: Party schools should further deepen their teaching reforms 
and collect all questions raised by the trainees during the 
course of their studies in a certain period. They should also 
have their teachers analyze and study these questions by 
applying dialectical and historical materialism, as well as have 
them successfully do their papers in line with these questions. 
Only by so doing can the party school reinforce their teaching 
targets. Party schools should make efforts to have their 
teaching systems suit the tremendous changes cropping up in the 
transition between the planned economy and the socialist market 
one. After the forum with the leading personnel and a number 
of teachers of the party school, Gu Jinchi cordially called on 
the third class attended by cadres from the units at the 
department (city) level, who were engaging in the study of 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Ai 
Tingjuan, representative of the trainees and vice mayor of the 
Shenyang City People's Government, briefed Secretary Gu Jinchi 
on their study situation. Then, he delivered a short speech and 
said: In studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, leading cadres must concentrate their efforts on 
carefully reading the original writings. Efforts should be made 
to foster a correct idea of development and to correctly 
understand that it will not do without the theoretical guidance 
of socialist market economy. He urged the trainees to firmly 
bear the reality in their minds while studying Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; to further 
emancipate their minds; and to emphatically study the issue of 
how to have the province's economy achieves sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development. He also urged them to work out ways of 
how to have their ideological and working methods truly suit the 
demands of establishing the socialist market economy, to 
heighten their spirit, to seize the opportunity, and to make 
contributions to restoring the province's imposing prestige. 
  Gu Jinchi also visited the trainees' dormitory and the 
reading room of the newly built library. 
  Yu Junbo, member of the provincial party standing committee 
and director of the organizational department under the 
provincial party committee, accompanied Gu Jinchi during the 
investigation and study tour.

  [Text] Shenyang, January 30 (XINHUA) -- About 14,000 
unemployed workers and staff members in Shenyang city, the 
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, are now 
receiving relief payments from the Unemployed Insurance Service. 
  Dong Lianzhi, an official of the Shenyang City Labor Bureau, 
said that the relief funds for the unemployed last year amounted 
to about 3 million yuan, the highest sum in history. 
  The official said that most of the unemployed were from 
enterprises. According to their different working years, they 
could get relief payments for from three to 24 months, adding 
that the monthly payment to each of them would be about 75 
percent of their past salary. 
  As one of China's leading heavy-industry cities and the 
largest industrial base in northeast China, Shenyang has more 
than 5,500 enterprises, with 2.3 million employees. 
  With the deepening of the reforms in the economic sector and 
labor system in China, the number of unemployed people is 
expected to increase. 
  To provide living guarantees for the unemployed in the city, 
the relevant Shenyang labor department set up the insurance fund 
service for the unemployed in 1986. 
  So far, at least 18,000 unemployed people have benefited 
from 
the system.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ding Chuanguang (0002 0278 0342): "Three </F>
Reforms Commence in Our Province -- Provincial Party Committee 
and Government Hold Meeting To Plan Organizational Reform and 
Promote Implementation of Civil Service, Payroll System Reform] 
  [Text] The provincial party committee and government held 
a work conference on organizational reform and reform of the 
civil service and payroll systems in Hefei 14-17 January. The 
conference mapped out specific plans for implementing the three 
reforms in our province in accordance with the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council's demands. 
  Provincial party and government leaders Lu Rongjing, Fu 
Xishou, Yang Yongliang, and Liu Guangcai attended the 
conference, which was chaired by Yang Duoliang. 
  Provincial party Secretary Lu Rongjing spoke at the 
conference. He urged principal party and government leaders at 
all levels to assume personal responsibility for actively 
organizing and spearheading reform of the three systems. We 
should unify thinking, improve understanding, and truly convert 
the central authorities' decision and arrangements into the 
common understanding of party committees and governments at all 
levels, as well as the conscientious actions of the masses. Lu 
Rongjing emphatically said: We should devise overall plans and 
make sound arrangements for economic work while planning for the 
three reforms. At no time should we slacken economic work. We 
should solve problems and find solutions during the course of 
reform in a reform spirit. We should strictly implement 
policies and enforce rigorous organizational discipline to 
ensure smooth progress in the three reforms in our province; 
promote changes in organizational functions; smooth work 
relationships; promote social stability; inspire the enthusiasm 
of the vast numbers of functionaries, effectively advance all 
areas of work; and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development in our province. 
  Fu Xishou, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee 
and governor, delivered a work report. He noted: Carrying out 
the three supplementary reforms is of great significance because 
it is urgently needed to deepen reform of the economic system, 
an important aspect of reform of the political system, and the 
inevitable choice for establishing a socialist market economic 
system. Therefore, the entire province should actively but 
steadily carry out organizational reform and promote reform of 
the civil service and payroll systems in a planned and 
step-by-step fashion in accordance with the unified plans of the 
party Central Committee, the State Council, the provincial party 
committee, and the provincial government. 
  At the conference's closing, provincial party Deputy 
Secretary Yang Yongliang arranged for implementing the 
conference's guidelines. Vice Governor Yang Duoliang gave a 
summing-up report. 
  Over 300 people attended, including members of the 
provincial 
leading group for organizational reform; leading party and 
government responsible comrades from various prefectural, city, 
and provincial and central-level units in Anhui; and directors 
of personnel bureaus and divisions, organizational offices, and 
payroll sections.

  [Text] Hefei, January 29 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
landlocked Anhui Province has benefited greatly from introducing 
foreign help to develop the local economy. 
  Anhui has employed more than 420 foreign experts whose 
assistance has generated 120 million yuan in extra economic 
returns over the past eight years. 
  The grain-basket province has also imported advanced 
cultivation technology, quality breeding stocks and other 
applied farming technologies to promote high-yielding 
agriculture with quality produce. 
  Last year Anhui spread the use of a rice cultivation and 
growing technique from Japan to one third of the province, 
achieving a ten percent output increase per mu (one mu is 0.1647 
ha [hectare]). 
  The Fuyang region benefited from the skills of a Japanese 
expert in growing apples. More than 700 kg of apples are now 
harvested per mu, a one-third increase. The region has devoted 
40,000 mu to growing the fruit. 
  Emphasis has meanwhile been placed on updating and retooling 
major state-owned enterprises. 
  A leather factory in Anqing employed 15 foreign experts to 
improve its technology and management skills, enabling its 
products to enter the world market and increase its annual 
output value by one million yuan. 
  "The key to success is using the talents of foreign experts 
to develop the local economy," said Zhang Mingxiang, deputy 
director of the province's Foreign Experts Office. 
  To date, Anhui has fostered close co-operative ties with 
countries like Japan, Germany, France, the United States and 
Canada. 
  Zhang said his office is planning to recruit more experts, 
including overseas Chinese, from more countries and regions to 
help modernize Anhui's major enterprises and agriculture.

  [Text] Fuzhou, January 30 (XINHUA) -- Lin Kaiqin, 
vice-governor of east China's Fujian Province, said that the 
provincial government will take effective measures to step up 
the development and reform of the power industry this year. 
  According to Lin, the province will increase its total 
installed capacity of electric power by one to 1.2 million kw 
annually in the succeeding six years before the year 2000, in a 
bid to meet the needs of its booming economy. 
  Reform of the investment structure of the power industry 
will 
be furthered enhanced. Those who invest in the power sector 
will be granted priority in using power. 
  Lin also noted that foreign business people are welcome to 
invest in the power sector. 
  According to local sources, the province is expected to step 
up preparatory work for the construction of a nuclear power 
station. 
  Official statistics show that last year the provincial total 
electric energy production hit some 19.6 billion kwh, 10.7 
percent more than in 1992. 
  However, at least 20 percent more is still required for the 
development of the economy.

plenary meeting yesterday, Governor Chen Huanyou drew up a plan 
for the government's tasks this year. The plan's general 
requirements are: earnestly implement the guidelines of the 14th 
CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, and enlarged meeting of the provincial party 
committee; continue to emancipate minds; insist on doing 
practical work; firmly seize opportunities to accelerate the 
pace of reform and opening up to the outside world; quicken

promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; and 
promote comprehensive social progress. Vice Governor Ji Yunshi 
presided over the meeting. Vice Governors Yu Xingde, Yang

  Chen Huanyou said: In the past year, all localities and 
departments in Jiangsu had seized opportunities, deepened 
reform, widened opening up, and strengthened and improved 
macroeconomic regulation and control, as well as upheld economic 
development and socialist spiritual modernization. As a result, 
the national economy thrived with new progress in various tasks. 
The comprehensive economic strength was lifted up to a new 
stage, and the second two-fold economic growth was realized 
seven years early. The per capita GNP was higher than the 
national average. 
  Chen Huanyou pointed out: This is an important year for 
maintaining a good development momentum for economic 
construction as well as a crucial year for promoting overall 
advancement and a vital breakthrough in reform. The government 
and its departments must do a good job in 10 aspects: 1) 
Centering on accelerating the establishment of the socialist 
market economic system, it is necessary to comprehensively 
deepen reform and accelerate the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system; a unified, open, competitive, and orderly 
market system; and a rational income distribution and social 
security system. 2) It is necessary to comprehensively 
implement a strategy of openness to quicken the process of 
internalization for Jiangsu's economy. 3) It is necessary to 
strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the 
national economy and to comprehensively develop rural economy. 
4) It is necessary to optimize industrial structure, increase 
the role of science and technology, and enhance economic 
efficiency. 5) It is necessary to plan meticulously and 
rationally to vigorously develop tertiary industry. 6) It is 
necessary to strengthen efforts in readjusting the investment 
structure by strengthening the construction of infrastructures 
and basic industries. 7) It is necessary to apply scientific 
and technological means for Jiangsu's development. We should 
further develop science and technology and education. 8) It is 
necessary to attach great importance to strictly control 
population growth as well as strengthen environmental protection 
and land-use management. 9) It is necessary to strengthen 
spiritual civilization and further promote cultural activities. 
10) It is necessary to correctly handle the relationship 
between reform and development and stability as well as 
strengthen socialist democracy and legal system construction to 
ensure social and political stability. 
  Chen Huanyou concluded: From now until the Spring Festival, 
leaders of all levels and departments must make appropriate 
arrangements for various work. It is necessary to ensure 
coordinated economic operation and stable production. We must 
stress safety and stop major accidents. We must work to ensure 
adequate market supply and stable market prices so that the 
people can have a joyous festival.

  [Text] Nanjing, January 30 (XINHUA) -- Jiangsu Province, 
one of the most economically developed provinces in China plans 
to attract some 10 billion U.S. dollars of direct overseas 
investment this year, according to local officials. 
  Offical figures show that last year the province approved 
more than 10,000 overseas-funded firms, involving a total 
investment of more than nine billion U.S. dollars, doubling the 
figures for the previous year. 
  Located in the Chang Jiang River Delta, a priority area of 
development in China, Jiangsu has been ranking first in total 
industrial and agricultural output value among all provinces in 
the country. A total of more than 18,000 overseas-funded firms 
have been established here by businesses from 85 countries and 
regions in the world. 
  Statistics show that the scale of overseas investment has 
been on the rise. More than 700 foreign-invested projects have 
been capitalized with more than 10 million U.S. dollars each. 
Some 60 leading international companies from the United States, 
Japan and the Netherlands have made investment in Jiangsu. 
  Meanwhile, in major cities like Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou 
60 
percent of the big state-owned enterprises have now introduced 
foreign investment. 
  The areas where foreign investment went to have also been 
expanded. Officials from the provincial department in charge of 
investment affairs said that most of the overseas investment has 
been concentrated in the ten national development zones in the 
province. But all counties and almost every township have 
introduced overseas investment. 
  Investment has poured into such fields as basic industries, 
infrastructures, the service sector and high technology. Since 
the beginning of the 1990s, foreign investors have shown great 
interest in the province's construction of highways, ports, 
bridges, airports and energy projects. 
  The officials also noted that in recent years more and more 
Taiwanese businesses have invested in the province. Official 
statistics show that to date, the province has approved more 
than 3,800 firms with Taiwan investment, involving a total 
contractual funds of over four billion U.S. dollars. Big 
projects with at least 10 million U.S. dollars have exceeded 100.

  [Text] On 27 January, at the provincial conference on 
discipline inspection and supervisory work, Jiang Chunyun, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, stressed the need 
to further strengthen leadership and do a solid job to firmly 
grasp and achieve even greater results in anticorruption 
campaign closely around the demand for the whole party's work 
known as seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability. 
  Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of the province, presided over the 
conference. Leading Comrades Li Zhen, Lu Maozeng, and Tan Fude 
attended the conference. Jiang Chunyun made an important speech. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: Struggling against corruption is one of 
the three major events emphatically grasped by the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council last year. Over the past five 
months, party and government organizations at all levels in the 
province have conscientiously implemented the important speeches 
of Comrade Jiang 
  Zemin and the guidelines of the second plenary session of 
the 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission, have exerted great 
efforts in doing a lot of work for struggling against 
corruption. In general terms, the central authorities' target 
of achieving marked results in anticorruption campaign at the 
present stage has already been fulfilled basically. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: This year, the general demand on 
the provincial discipline inspection and supervisory work is to 
continuously carry out the CPC Central Committee's decision on 
waging the struggle against corruption, closely around the 
central task of economic construction, by implementing the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building the socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, in order to 
carry on the anticorruption campaign in a penetrating manner 
with even greater results on the basis of consolidating the 
already achieved results. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed that attention should be paid to the 
issues in the following four aspects: First, we should pay 
attention to the focus and continue to make leading cadres 
clean, honest, and strict with themselves. This year, the focus 
of the anticorruption campaign should be still placed on the 
leading cadres at or above the county and city levels. Leading 
party and government organizations at all levels in the province 
should further maintain administrative honesty in combination 
with their respective realities in line with the five 
stipulations and new demands set by the central authorities. 
Leading comrades of all localities must take a lead and set an 
example for their subordinates. Lower levels should also 
positively help leading organs in struggling against corruption 
rather than interfering with it. 
  Second, we should grasp [words indistinct] to safeguard the 
seriousness of party and administrative discipline. In 
investigating and handling cases, we should place emphasis on 
leading party and government organs, judicial departments, law 
enforcing administrative departments, and economic management 
departments. Party and government organizations at all levels 
should further strengthen leadership and support discipline and 
law enforcing departments to handle cases. Those who obstruct 
and interfere with the handling of cases, who conceal and refuse 
to report cases, who pigeonholed cases and refuse to investigate 
them, and who investigate cases but refuse to pose punishment 
should be [words indistinct] immediately. We should persist in 
the system of making party and government leaders assume the 
responsibility for handling cases, and the cases that are 
difficult to be handled should be taken on by first and second 
top leaders of party committees. Discipline and law enforcing 
organizations should persist in principles and [words 
indistinct] Once major clues for solving cases are discovered, 
they should be seized firmly. No matter who is involved, all 
cases should be investigated thoroughly and dealt with 
resolutely without any tolerance. Severe punishment should be 
given to those who indulge in the practice of higher authorities 
having policies and the localities having their countermeasures 
and to those who infringe upon the overall interests for the 
sake of the immediate, partial, and small groups' interests. 
  Third, we should pay attention to checking the unhealthy 
trends strongly commented by the masses. In correcting the 
unhealthy trends of various trades, we should proceed from the 
heads of trades and from the sources. By adopting the method of 
clearing up higher levels first and lower levels then and 
combining higher levels with lower ones, leading organs should 
take the lead in clearing up unhealthy trends and solving 
problems. Organizational departments, in particular, must set 
an example for the whole province. 
  Fourth, we should grasp systems and gradually bring the work 
of opposing corruption and advocating administrative honesty to 
the orbit of institutionalization and standardization. The most 
important thing to solve the corruption problem is to depend on 
laws and systems. We should study the laws and characteristics 
of market economy, unite them with reform and development, and 
gradually set up a supervisory and restriction mechanism that is 
suitable for the socialist market economic system. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: We should actually strengthen 
leadership over the anticorruption campaign. The campaign has 
now entered the stage of tackling the most difficult problems. 
Success or failure in achieving substantive progress in this 
campaign has a bearing on the prestige of the party among the 
masses and on reform, development, and stability. Party and 
government organizations at all levels must actually strengthen 
leadership, be meticulous in organization, and firmly grasp the 
anticorruption campaign. We should strictly grasp policies and 
principles to promote the sound and effective progress of the 
anticorruption campaign.

<F P=106> [JIEFANG RIBAO commentator: "Leaders Should Take Up the </F>
Responsibility of Ensuring Security in Their Districts"] 
  [Text] Public security is a hot issue of public concern, 
and an issue to which the people have responded strongly. It is 
also one project to which the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee 
and the municipal government have attached great importance. As 
a result of the various measures party and government leaders 
have taken to tighten comprehensive management of public 
security in recent years, Shanghai's public security and order 
have improved noticeably, and a environment favorable for 
Shanghai's reform, opening up, and economic development has been 
created. Nevertheless, we should also realize that certain 
districts are still plagued by serious public security problems, 
and the people are eager to see this situation change. Leading 
cadres in these districts must fully understand their 
responsibilities and take effective measures to deal with the 
problems until actual results have been achieved. 
  Shanghai has a system under which leading cadres are charged 
with the responsibility for managing public security in a 
comprehensive manner. This system has institutionalized the 
principle that "whoever is in charge should also take up his or 
her responsibilities." Under this system, principal party and 
government leaders must be the first persons responsible for the 
security of the districts and departments under their charge. 
Experience proves the key to achieving comprehensive management 
of public security lies in the leadership exercised by the top 
leaders of one level over the top leaders of the next level. 
Comprehensive management of public security is a broadly 
involved and formidable social systems engineering project; and 
only when principal leaders attach importance to it, care for 
it, support it, and involve themselves in it can they mobilize 
and guide other responsible cadres to do their job with real 
efforts. In accordance with their assignments for comprehensive 
management of public security, party and government cadres at 
all levels must find their respective positions, discharge their 
respective responsibilities, properly supervise their own staff, 
and take proper care of their own affairs so that peace can be 
ensured in districts under their charge. 
  To succeed in comprehensive management of public security, 
the system governing leaders' responsibilities in ensuring peace 
in districts under their charge should become one criterion 
having a close bearing on leading cadres' term of office, 
performance evaluation, promotion, and award or disciplinary 
action. Leading party and government cadres of various 
districts and departments whose serious negligence of duty has 
given rise to protracted public disorder or to major incidents 
upsetting the local stability must be disciplined in accordance 
with relevant party and administrative rules. 
  To show that they care about comprehensive management of 
public security, leading cadres at all levels must conduct 
investigation and study at grass-roots units and attend to their 
major problems. More importantly, they must pay attention to 
giving full scope to the roles played by organs in charge of 
comprehensive management of public security as well as 
departments in charge of public security, judicial, and 
educational affairs. Moreover, they must attach importance to 
the work of these departments, care for their work, support 
their work, and earnestly help them deal with the outstanding 
problems they encounter in their work. We should also have 
effective measures for mobilizing the people, especially party 
member-cadres, to take part in the management of public security 
in certain districts or trades so that the work of ensuring 
peace there will become an obligation of each and every one. 
  Development needs stability, and there will be no 
development 
without stability. On the other hand, development promotes 
stability, and stability ensures development. Leading cadres at 
all levels must fully understand and have a firm grip of the 
dialectical relationship between development and stability. 
Under the new situation where Shanghai continues to deepen 
reform, open wider to the outside world, and take the lead in 
building a socialist market economic system, we hope all our 
cadres will take advantage of the system of delegating leading 
cadres responsibility for comprehensive management of public 
security, and mobilize and organize people in our society to 
intensify the project so that a social environment favorable for 
achieving a sustained, fast, and healthy economic development 
can be created in Shanghai.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 29 (XINHUA) -- Huang Ju, mayor of 
Shanghai, said today that the financial industry has become a 
crucial force of the metropolis's social and economic 
development. 
  The mayor was addressing a financial conference here. He 
said that Shanghai's steady economic development in 1992 was 
closely related with the rapid growth of the finance sector in 
the city's economy. It would act as a strong backup to the 
city's further reforms and development. 
  The mayor pointed out that a big modern market, with finance 
as its core, is being framed in the city. Its stock market had 
a total transaction of 520 billion yuan last year.

administration on bank loans, develop financial markets, promote 
reforms in state-run commercial banks as well as in foreign 
exchange administration systems, according to Mao Yingliang, 
director of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 31 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai's 92 joint 
stock companies which have issued stocks to the public are 
displaying strong vitality in market economic conditions. 
  By the end of last year these enterprises, involved in the 
fields of industry, commerce, public utilities and real estate, 
had combined capital totalling 22.3 billion yuan. Twenty-nine 
of them have been approved to issue B-shares and H-shares. 
  A survey shows that they have raised a sum of more than 30 
billion yuan by issuing stocks. 
  Last year, 31 of them each generated 40 percent more profits 
than in the previous year. The economic index of the rate of 
output value, and profits and taxes, and the net increase of 
fixed assets was higher than the average level for Shanghai's 
industries. 
  At present, these enterprises have separated their property 
ownership from management, and shifted their operational 
mechanisms toward the market economy. 
  One example is the Shanghai Petrochemical Company Ltd, which 
has 6.2 billion yuan in capital. 
  Aiming at establishing the modern enterprise system, the 
company has cut its organizations from 55 to 19 and reduced its 
employees from 1,270 to 420. 
  Meanwhile, it has employed an international standard 
financial auditing system to reduce its production costs. 
  A municipal government official in charge of industry 
disclosed that shanghai's enterprise reform this year will 
concentrate on the establishment of a modern enterprise system, 
including the formation of joint stock companies which will 
float their shares. 
  At the same time, partnership companies have gained a rapid 
development. By the end of last year, the number of such 
enterprises had to 2,992, with capital totalling 1.46 billion 
yuan.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Shanghai Strives To Improve Environment"] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, January 30 (XINHUA) -- Anyone who revisits 
Shanghai will be happy to see the daily improved environment 
here. 
  Factories discharging heavy pollution in urban areas have 
been removed or switched to produce pollution-free goods, and 
the first construction phase of the waste water treatment 
project on Suzhou Creek across the city has been completed. 
  Projects completed last year included the expansion of the 
Zhabei Water Works, construction of the Yangpu Bridge and 
plantation of lawns and street gardens. 
  According to Gu Yongkang, an official of the municipal 
bureau 
of environmental protection, the rapid economic development will 
inevitably bring with it pollution problem. 
  To develop Shanghai -- China's biggest economic center -- 
into a world first-class metropolis, with clean, beautiful and 
comfortable surroundings, the municipal government is spending 
23.9 billion yuan, including foreign loans, on environmental 
protection and urban construction in the 1991-95 period. 
  Included in this sum is a record 10 billion yuan used in 
1993. 
  "The days are numbered when people smell because of the 
Suzhou Creek a mile off," said Zhou Yucheng, senior engineer of 
the Shanghai construction company for treating waste water. 
  A 33.39-kilometer-long pipe has been laid to carry water 
from 
the creek in the urban area directly to the East China Sea after 
treatment. 
  "When the whole project is completed," Zhou noted, "it will 
be able to treat and clean the waste water in the creek for 
industrial use and irrigating crops." 
  A survey shows that about 300 industrial enterprises 
discharging pollution in urban areas had been removed or 
switched to produce pollution-free goods by the end of 1993 and 
300 more are ready for treatment. 
  "From now on, no factory which does not accord with the 
demands of environmental protection is allowed to be built in 
the urban area," said Gu Bochuan, an official of the Shanghai 
Municipal Economic Commission in Charge of Planning. 
  "Shanghai will follow the new industrial pattern with focus 
on the development of pollution-free, high-tech industries 
including electronics, computer and bio-engineering," he added. 
  While rearranging the industrial structure, China's most 
populous city has also vowed to expand green coverage in its 
limited urban area. 
  According to a plan of the municipal greening department, 
Shanghai will build three new parks this year, bringing the 
total number in the city up to 61, and expand tree belts, lawns 
and gardens by 93 hectares during this period. 
  By the end of the year 2000, Shanghai residents will have an 
average of four square meters of public green areas per capita, 
up from 1.1 square meters per capita at present. 
  According to the municipal environmental protection bureau, 
Shanghai will adopt measures to clean the Huangpu River. 
  Included are construction of animal droppings treatment 
projects on the upper reaches of the river, and taking specific 
measures to prevent and clean industrial pollution. 
  At present, Shanghai is building a second drinking water 
source. 
  Projects whose construction has been completed include the 
expansion of the Zhabei Water Works, Lingqiao Water works in New 
Pudong Area, a newly-established economic zone, Yuepu Water 
Works and the Qingchaosha Reservoir. 
  Upon completion, a bureau official said, these projects will 
greatly help improve the drinking water quality of Shanghai 
residents. 
  In addition, the city will build a wild animal farm and a 
tree belt this year. 
  Huang Ju, mayor of the city, said: "Our purpose is to 
develop 
Shanghai into a city with the world's first-grade ecology and 
modern infrastructure facilities." 
  More and more people in Shanghai are full of confidence in 
this aim.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 30 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, the 
largest port in China, remained at the top of the list in 1993 
in terms of handling capacity. 
  Last year, the port reported a handling capacity of 175.96 
million tons, a net increase of more than 13 million tons over 
that of 1992, according to the Ministry of Communications. 
  The figure puts Shanghai some 100 million tons ahead of 
Qinhuangdao port, the second in terms of handling capacity, 
located in north China's Hebei Province. The increase amount 
almost equals the annual handling capacity of Rizhao in East 
China's Shandong Province. 
  The handling capacity of the port rose by 5.2 percent in 
1991 
and 11 percent in 1992. Its growth rate last year was 7.4 
percent. 
  In addition, major seaports of China reported a handling 
capacity of 635.56 million tons in 1993, up 12.6 percent 
compared with the previous year. 
  Of the ports which have a handling capacity of more than 50 
million tons each, Shanghai's growth rate is lower than those of 
Ningbo in Zhejiang and Guangzhou in Guangdong and much higher 
than those of Dalian and Qinhuangdao.

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Jieren (1327 0512 0086): "Provincial </F>
Economic Work Conference Closes Yesterday -- Li Zemin Speaks; 
Chai Songyue Makes Summing-up; Wan Xueyuan, Liu Feng, Lu 
Zhangong Present"] 
  [Text] The four-day provincial economic work conference 
closed yesterday. Li Zemin, Wan Xueyuan, Liu Feng, Chai 
Songyue, Lu Zhangong, Xu Yongqing, Liu Xirong, Liang Pingbo, Si 
Daxiao, Xu Xingguan, Long Anding, Zhang Qimei, Xu Zhichun, Sun 
Jiaxian, and other provincial leaders attended yesterday's 
meeting. Li Zemin spoke and Chai Songyue gave a summing-up of 
the conference, expressing his opinions on the reform of the 
fiscal and taxation system as well as enterprise and 
agricultural problems, which were matters of great interest. 
  In the reform of five major systems, reform of the fiscal 
and 
taxation system is the one with great difficulties and 
encompassing a wide range of issues. Practicing the financial 
system of separated taxes and gradually bringing the "contract 
system" to an end is not only a significant reform in fiscal and 
taxation work, but will also lead to crucial changes in the 
behavior of the government and enterprises. The current reform 
of the taxation system, which has introduced the value-added tax 
and unified income tax rates, is extremely indispensable to 
bringing about a system of fair taxation and thus creating a 
market environment for fair competition among enterprises. 
Although the reform of the fiscal and taxation system has 
caused some problems that cannot be ignored in the economic work 
in the near term, what is more important is that it has offered 
a rare opportunity to step up Zhejiang's economic growth and 
improve its economic quality. We should all the more be aware 
of its beneficial effect on long-term development, and stand on 
a higher point and take a longer view. We should often approach 
the issue of reforming the fiscal and taxation system with a 
positive view and thus grasp its significance, use our brains 
frequently, and think of a way to practice it; whoever grasps 
this issue and takes the earlier initiative will benefit sooner. 
  The fundamental way out for running enterprises well under 
the new situation still lies in deepening reform. From a 
long-term point of view, we should strive to attain the goal and 
fulfill the requirement of establishing a modern enterprise 
system. At the moment, we should run existing enterprises well 
as the preparatory and fundamental work for the establishment of 
a modern enterprise system in the future. In light of the fact 
that Zhejiang's enterprises increased their losses last year and 
some of them have failed to reverse their loss-making situation 
for a long time, in proceeding with reform this year we should 
firmly follow the principle of the circulation of equities in a 
market economy to promote reform bravely and strive for a new 
breakthrough this year. Enterprise reform is the microeconomic 
basis of economic reform as well as the key to the success or 
failure of this year's reform. In approaching the issue of 
enterprise reform, we should further emancipate our minds and 
feel freer in taking action. 
  To put agriculture on the course of a market economy, we 
still have to keep exploring in the course of practice. 
Developing high-yield, high-efficiency, and fine-quality 
agriculture as well as developing "large-scale agriculture" 
which incorporates the distribution system is the direction we 
should adhere to. Since Zhejiang deregulated prices of farm 
produce, the problem of ignoring the government's guidance and 
administration has existed in the past few years. This year, we 
must redress abnormal phenomenon in agriculture, such as large 
area of uncultivated land and unattended fertile farmland. We 
should reverse some cadres' view that the government is of no 
help to agricultural production, particularly grain production, 
and thus let it drift. We should also study and improve ways to 
guide peasants' work and must not further increase their burden. 
We should strengthen management over the supplies of the means 
of agricultural production to cut the cost and increase the 
returns of growing grain. 
  The tasks in this year's economic work and reform are 
arduous. We should look to the following: The organization and 
establishment of local financial institutions is of important 
significance to local economic development in the future, all 
localities and departments in charge of financing should do more 
preparatory work for the organization and establishment of 
cooperative banks in urban and rural areas -- making plans first 
and strive to take a significant step towards this goal this 
year. We should make good arrangements to ensure supplies on 
the market, strive to control commodity prices, and forestall 
manmade abrupt price hikes. Meanwhile, we should ensure 
industrial production, transport services, traffic safety, 
public security, and others around the spring festival in a 
down-to-earth manner. 
  The special meetings on financing, taxation, economic 
restructuring, planning, and foreign trade, which were held 
simultaneously with the provincial economic work conference, 
have also successfully completed their respective major agendas. 
Some 1,500 comrades in charge of prefectural, city, and county 
governments and departments around the province attended this 
conference.

  [Text] Hangzhou -- Hangzhou, the provincial capital of 
East China's Zhejiang Province, is still booming from 
co-operations with foreign investors, a municipal spokesman said 
over the weekend. 
  And city officials pledge to invest more funds and expand 
foreign trade. 
  The city, renowned for its scenic spot of West Lake, has 
continued foreign expansion by improving the investment 
environment, said the spokesman Shen Zheshou. 
  In 1993, 1,078 foreign-funded enterprises were approved in 
the city, with investments of 357 million yuan ($41.03 million). 
  The total number of foreign-funded enterprises in the city 
is 
1,959, with an actual foreign input at $540 million, he said. 
  Meanwhile, the commodities special for foreign trade went up 
to 11.18 billion yuan ($1.28 billion) last year, a 65.7 percent 
increase over 1992. 
  More than $468 million worth of exports were done directly 
by 
the enterprises, which previously used foreign trade companies 
as agents. 
  Shen added that five enterprises were set up abroad. 
  And city businessmen also signed more contracts to build 
engineering projects in foreign countries. 
  The city's industrial achievements in other sectors during 
the past year were also remarkable, said Shen. 
  The city has sped up its infrastructure construction and 
renovated buildings to provide a sound investment climate in 
1993. 
  The efforts have paid off. 
  Four State-level development zones have received 377 
projects 
worth $941.8 million. Construction of three provincial-level 
economic and development zones is also underway, he added. 
  Total investment in fixed assets was up 45.6 percent over 
1992 to 9.6 billion yuan ($1.1 billion). 
  And 17 major transportation projects, with an expected 
investment of 2.3 billion yuan ($254 million), started 
construction last year.

  [Text] Beijing, January 30 (XINHUA) -- From this month, 
parents of drop-outs at primary and secondary schools in Beijing 
are to be fined between 200-5,000 yuan, according to a new 
regulation issued recently by the municipal government. 
  The regulation, which is aimed to stress implementation of 
the compulsory education law, noted that at the beginning of 
each semester, parents and guardians of school-age children must 
ensure that the children enter school to receive compulsory 
education. 
  The compulsory education period in China lasts nine years 
including six years for primary school and three years for 
junior secondary school. 
  Beijing adopted an educational inspection system in 1986. 
Now 14 counties and districts in the city have set up 
educational inspectors' offices. 
  Recently, the Beijing municipal government appointed a group 
of new educational inspectors to supervise the implementation of 
the compulsory education law in the city. 
  Song Baozhang, one of the inspectors of the Beijing 
Municipal 
Education Bureau, said that there are now 1.46 million 
youngsters who are studying at primary schools and junior 
secondary schools in Beijing. 
  The schooling rate at primary schools in Beijing reached 
99.9 
percent and the rate at junior secondary schools was 99.92 
percent, Song said.

  [Text] After hearing the reports by the provincial-level 
departments concerned, provincial leaders, including Cheng 
Weigao, urged again that we should realistically solve problems 
and ensure that the masses should spend the Spring Festival in a 
good way. 
  According to the requirements of the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government, our province should 
completely pay back the wages in arrears to teachers, office 
cadres, and retired cadres by 5 February. 
  After hearing the reports, Cheng Weigao said: In the 
previous stage, according to the guidelines of the central 
authorities and the requirements of the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government, the departments 
concerned in the province did a lot of work and adopted some 
very good methods and measures. Although a few problems have not 
completely been solved, most problems have been alleviated. To 
further improve the work and thoroughly solve the problems, we 
should mainly attend to two tasks. First, we should set time to 
pay back the wages in arrears to teachers, cadres, and retired 
cadres; and to solve the problems that the staff members and 
workers of the enterprises with difficulties, the disaster-hit 
rural areas, and the extremely difficult areas lack money and 
grain to spend the Spring Festival. Second, we should ensure 
the stability of goods prices and particularly ensure to 
stabilize the prices of grain, oil, meat, eggs, and vegetables. 
We should realistically conduct price inspections and market 
management. 
  Cheng Weigao pointed out: Solving practical problems for the 
masses and ensuring we spend the Spring Festival in a good way 
is not a specific problem but a matter relating to the overall 
situation. As for the areas that cannot pay back the wages in 
arrears, the leaders there should first sell their sedan cars 
and then pay wages to the staff and workers. 
  Cheng Weigao stressed: Our country is not rich enough. So, 
we should vigorously advocate the policy of being diligent to 
build the country and do all undertakings and the policy of 
waging an arduous struggle and arduously doing pioneering work, 
resolutely oppose waste and extravagance, and create the 
greatest economic results with the least input. The leading 
organs and the leading cadres should set an example in this 
regard.

  [Text] Tianjin, January 30 (XINHUA) -- Construction of a 
building to house more students from overseas at the 
International College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in north 
China's Tianjin city started this week. 
  The buildings, providing 17,000 square meters of space, are 
designed for the study and residence of the 163 overseas 
students at the college. 
  The college is the chief educational center of traditional 
Chinese medicine in China. The overseas students who have 
enrolled since September 1992 come from 18 countries and regions 
in the world, including the United States, Germany, Denmark, the 
Republic of Korea, Japan and Singapore. 
  Yu Tiecheng, assistant to the president of the college, said 
that with more and more people becoming interested in 
traditional Chinese medicine, the college will expand its 
enrollment of overseas students. 
  He said that the students to be enlisted into the college 
next year will reach 500. Last year there were more than 400 
overseas applicants for study at the college. But the shortage 
of buildings limited the capacity of the college, which took on 
only 70. 
  The construction project includes 12,000-square-meter 
residential buildings and a 5,000-square-meter classroom 
building. 
  Sponsored by the Tianjin Traditional Medical College, the 
International College of Traditional Chinese Medicine offers 
undergraduate and post-graduate courses of traditional Chinese 
medicine, acupuncture and traditional Chinese pharmacy.

  [Text] Guiyang, January 30 (XINHUA) -- The burgeoning 
broadcasting and television education has eased a serious 
shortage of well-trained personnel in Guizhou, an interior 
province in southwest China. 
  According to Shi Hongzhi, president of the Guizhou 
Broadcasting and Television University, the school has had 
50,000 graduates in the past 14 years, about half as many as 
graduated from all the 23 Guizhou-based institutions of higher 
learning during the same period. 
  She also said that more than 200,000 people have received 
short-term and in-service training. 
  This kind of education, highly cost-effective, has found 
special preference in Guizhou, whose overall development has 
long been restrained by shortage of funds and a lack of 
well-trained professionals. 
  In one case, the poverty-ridden Miao-Bouyei Autonomous 
County 
of Ziyun presented little attraction for university graduates, 
and those who did go there soon left because of hardships. 
  The local authorities could do nothing but turn to 
broadcasting and television education for help and, moreover, 
they regard it as a short-cut. 
  To date the county has more than 200 graduates who 
specialised in a wide range of subjects. 
  In a large steel company of the province, 580 workers in 
various key positions have been given access to the province's 
broadcasting and television education program and now have 
become the backbone of the company. 
  According to President Shi, her university now has 22 branch 
schools scattered across the province, and teaching posts have 
covered half of the province's counties. 
  Shi Hongzhi added that the teaching programs have yielded 
initial success, citing for example that 66 graduates working in 
a field workplace of the ministry of aerospace industry have 
been awarded national prizes. 
  She also said that her university aims targets directly to 
the service of the local economic buildup, so it adjusts its 
syllabuses quite often in order to train and provide 
professionals that are most urgently in demand, such as people 
skilled in science, technology, economics and law. 
  The major subjects offered at the broadcasting and 
television 
university have soared from three to 90, including such 
important ones as the manufacturing of plane engines, railway 
electrification and tourism management.

<F P=106> [From John Kohut in Chengdu] </F>
  [Text] The number one political job in China's most 
populous province is a lot less glamorous than it may sound: 
the pay is terrible, the work is full of headaches, and even 
the pettiest of details sometimes have to be handled by the man 
at the top. "Actually, China is the most democratic country in 
the world," jokes Sichuan's Governor Xiao Yang, an ebullient, 
grand-fatherly figure of 62 who took office last February and 
has made a name for himself as one of China's most reform-minded 
leaders. 
  When the expressway between Chongqing and Chengdu opened, 
for 
example, Mr Xiao had fences put up to prevent pigs and dogs from 
trying to skip through the traffic. Two days after the fences 
went up, peasants dismantled them. "They thought it was 
inconvenient." When stock prices drop or people have a gripe 
about a corrupt local official, they write to the Governor, who 
personally responds to the most important of the 300 written 
petitions he receives from ordinary folk each month. 
  Such are the everyday problems Mr Xiao faces. Far more 
pressing, for his own political as well as his people's future, 
is the threat of peasant riots; controlling the birth rate of a 
province which, at 110 million people, is the most populous in 
China; preventing inflation from going out of control; and above 
all, transforming Sichuan from relative poverty to something 
approaching the prosperity of the coastal areas. 
  After more than a decade of the central government pampering 
the coastal areas with economic reform prerogatives, it finally 
looks as if hinterland provinces such as Sichuan will be getting 
a bigger share of the pie. Last year, the central government 
invested 30 billion yuan (about HK$27 billion [Hong Kong 
dollars]) in Sichuan. This year, the figure will probably reach 
40 billion. A big portion of the money will go into 
infrastructure. 
  Foreign investment in Sichuan last year soared to U.S.$2.6 
billion (HK$20.2 billion), double the amount of the previous 
year. The bulk of this investment has been small-scale, 
low-technology ventures, but the province is now trying to 
attract big infrastructure projects. Mr Xiao said Sichuan hoped 
to sign an agreement with AT&amp;T this year to set up a 
telephone 
switching joint venture which would produce about one million 
telephone lines per year. And the province has started up an 
electricity generating equipment plant with General Electric of 
Canada. 
  In urban areas, a big problem this year will be controlling 
inflation, which was eight or nine percent last year, well below 
the national average, but gaining momentum. The provincial 
government wants to contain inflation to about 10 percent this 
year, "but I can't be certain we can accomplish this," Mr Xiao 
said. When prices soared last year, the government stepped in 
and sold grain from its reserves to calm the market. Guangdong 
recently set price controls, but Mr Xiao said there were dangers 
in tampering with the free market. "If you want to build a 
socialist market economy, then it isn't appropriate that prices 
not move," he said. 
  By the Governor's account, inflation hits hard at a lot of 
people, in particular the province's 400,000 retired Communist 
Party cadres, three to four million retired workers, and 
tottering state- run enterprises employing four or five million 
people. Including dependents, that runs to 20 or 30 million 
people, roughly a quarter of the provincial population. To 
buffer them against these price spirals--and thus ensure against 
worker demonstrations--Mr Xiao hopes to introduce a policy which 
will adjust workers' wages to increases in the cost of living. 
He is now waiting for the central government to approve the 
proposal. 
  Mr Xiao says one of his biggest problems is population 
control. A campaign is currently in progress to improve 
contraception and get people to obey China's 
one-child-per-family law. The Governor estimates his province 
probably has several million more people than reported in the 
national census. "Some areas report that they haven't produced 
(children), but in fact they produced a lot," Mr Xiao said.

<F P=106> [By Douglas Wade, "recently" in Lhasa] </F>
  [Text] As the numbers of Chinese settling in the "Tibet 
Autonomous Region" increase, reports are filtering through of 
growing unrest in rural areas. For the first time, there is 
clear evidence the Chinese Government is actively encouraging 
agricultural workers from China to settle in rural sites 
specially prepared in Tibet. 
  Chinese peasants are being attracted by loan guarantees, 
less 
stringent application of the one child policy and promises of 
land. At the same time, Chinese mining operations in remote 
regions of Tibet are being stepped up, helped by investments in 
infrastructure, principally road building, costing some 800 
million yuan (about HK$710 million [Hong Kong dollars]), 
according to XINHUA (the New China News Agency). 
  This has sparked numerous protests by Tibetan farming 
communities, expressing their resentment at what they see as 
Chinese appropriation of Tibetan timber minerals and land. 
However, it now appears that the scale of the Chinese 
population transfers -- which entail preparations for tens of 
thousands of settlers -- is resulting in ever bolder and more 
widespread opposition. 
  The largest rural settlement programme documented is that 
now 
underway in the Lhasa valley, where a United Nations scheme 
intended to enhance the fertility of the valley will reportedly 
result in some 130,000 Chinese peasants taking up residence. 
Tibetan villagers in the Lhasa valley have reported receiving 
official notification that they will be required to vacate their 
houses to accommodate Chinese settlers. The farmers claimed 
that at a village meeting they were also informed they would 
have to "give up surplus land", in response to which, although 
they did not dare openly criticise the principle of Chinese 
settlement, several villagers complained field quotas were 
already too low. 
  Reports of similar events elsewhere in Tibet indicate that 
local farmers are often heavily in debt to the authorities as a 
result of various taxes, and sometimes due to contracts for 
chemical fertilisers which they have been encouraged to sign. 
  One farmer from Dampa expressed his sense of grievance over 
the loss of his land in a written statement that was smuggled 
out of Tibet: "I have been ordered to pay 1,000 yuan per mu (a 
unit of land) as tax. I have two mu and I was forced to pay 
2,000 yuan per year. The sky belongs to the communists and the 
earth belongs to the communists. If we fail to pay the tax, the 
leaders seize the land from the masses and give it to the 
Chinese in order to please them. Lots of people tried their 
utmost to hold on to their farm lands but ultimately it was 
taken from them against their will." 
  The transfer programme has in other cases led to more 
forthright expressions of anger. Over recent months there have 
been numerous accounts of village meetings being disrupted, with 
pro-independence poster and leaflet campaigns in areas thought 
to have been politically cowed since the suppression of the 1959 
uprising, and even of the organised sabotage of infrastructure, 
such as road construction and telecommunications. 
  Rural demonstrations, unlike the urban protest marches, have 
apparently shown little fear of authority. In one case last 
September, farmers from Sungling in the southern province of 
Lokha operated road blocks on the main road in their area for 
two days and distributed leaflets and posters calling for 
Tibetan independence. When the local administration sent two 
cadres to investigate, they spent the day beside the road 
without food, while the demonstrators spat on them and called 
them names. The demonstration was broken up only when armed 
police arrived. 
  In Kyimshi, also in the Lokha region, it appears Tibetan 
farmers protesting at the purging of Tibetan officials known to 
oppose the population transfer programme took control of their 
region for a full month before 1,700 troops quelled the 
rebellion. In an appeal to the UN smuggled over the border to 
India, the Kyimshi villagers asserted that during the protest 
more than 700 demonstrators united to expel Chinese cadres from 
their region, liberate Tibetan prisoners and shout slogans 
calling for independence and an end to the population transfer 
programme. 
  Concluding their appeal, the villagers expressed concern 
over 
the fate of 35 named men and women currently detained in Gutsa 
Prison in Lhasa. The appeal concluded: "The village has been 
surrounded, with each home guarded by three soldiers. On the 
hill to the south of the village they have set up machine-gun 
posts. At present, people in this village are in a state of 
turmoil, living under tension and terror. All the people of the 
village participated in this demonstration, and as a result our 
brothers and sisters are now undergoing severe treatment, 
imprisonment and torture. We Tibetans have no human rights and 
are facing great risk of extermination. We ask for urgent 
action to be taken by the United Nations." 
  Similar, but smaller, events have resulted in numerous 
arrests elsewhere. Sentences of up to 15 years imprisonment 
have been handed down to demonstrators on charges of "spreading 
propaganda regarding counter-revolution". Asia Watch and 
Amnesty International have documentation of 75 named men and 
women imprisoned as a result of non-violent demonstrations in 
rural regions of Tibet over the last year, although the actual 
figure is undoubtedly much higher. There is also well-documented 
evidence of the routine torture and beatings of these prisoners. 
  Ultimately, the causes of this wave of rural unrest are the 
same as those that sparked off the major demonstrations in Lhasa 
last year. As the population in Tibet swells due to the influx 
of Chinese settlers, prices of food and essential goods rise. 
Tibetans who are losing out in the increased competition for 
education, jobs and land rights are thus faced with destitution. 
However, the Chinese Government continues to encourage 
migration in the apparent hope it will settle their problems 
there once and for all. 
  On July 21, 1993, Jiang Zemin was quoted by Xinhua as 
praising "individuals who have left their homes in coastal and 
other regions to contribute to Tibet's economic and social 
development". In August, the new deputy secretary of the 
Tibetan Communist Party, Chen Kuiyuan, said: "We should open 
our job market to all our fellow countrymen to participate in 
the economic opening." 
  Meanwhile, the Tibetan government in exile, headed by the 
Dalai Lama, fears it will soon be faced with a situation in 
which even if there is a plebiscite over Tibetan independence, 
the on-going influx of Chinese settlers may put the outcome in 
doubt. 
  As one of the ministers of the exiled Tibetan government, 
Kalon Tashi Wangdi, said: "China hopes to drown Tibetans in a 
sea of Chinese."

  [Text] Lhasa, January 29 (XINHUA) -- A number of key 
energy, transportation and agricultural projects are taking 
economic center stage in the Tibet Autonomous Region, southwest 
China. 
  The projects, involving a total investment of more than six 
billion yuan (about 690 million U.S. dollars), are helping 
improve Tibet's investment conditions and exploiting the 
abundant local resources. 
  So far, some of the key projects managed by the state and 
local authorities have been put into use. 
  The Gongkar Airport in southern Tibet, upgraded by the state 
to the tune of 273 million yuan, is now the only airport linking 
Tibet with the outside world with its advanced runway, 
communication facilities and passenger lounge. 
  A comprehensive agricultural development project is 
providing 
water to another 22,000 ha [hectare] of farmland, pasture and 
woodland in Tibet with the completion of reservoirs and 
diversion works last year. As a result, Tibet will increase its 
production of grain by 5,000 tons and of vegetables by 500 tons 
a year. 
  China's largest chromite base is also taking shape in Tibet, 
capable of turning out 110,200 tons of ore a year. 
  In addition, some other key projects, including telephone 
services, a hydropower station and a highway, are all making 
progress.

Renhui (6392 0088 6311): "The Great Progress of This Region's 
Foreign Trade"] 
  [Text] The Tibet Autonomous Region Foreign Trade 
Department grasped the opportune time to adjust its trade 
strategy last year and made considerable progress in developing 
imports and exports. The region's imports and exports in 1993 
reached US$52.06 million, of which imports were $51.2 million 
and exports were $868,000. The total increased 32 percent over 
the previous year. The net amount of import tax delivered to 
the state was 64.06 million yuan. Reporters learned this from 
the regional foreign trade import-export company's 11 January 
work conference. 
  Under the situation in which an import market has not been 
formed and the consumer market is still relatively narrow in 
this region, the regional foreign trade company actively 
cooperated with enterprises in other localities of the country 
to expand trade and other business operations. In 1993, the 
regional foreign trade department strived to expand trade with 
neighboring countries. The foreign trade company and a Nepalese 
business concern jointly set up a carpet plant in Lhasa. The 
Nepalese company's investment was $100,000 and the foreign trade 
company's was 2.2 million renminbi [yuan]. The plant was 
formally put into operation in July, and the plant produced over 
600 square meters of handmade Tibetan carpets as of the end of 
last year. In 1993, the plant exported items with a total value 
of $388,000 and imported items with a total of $160,000 through 
border trade. 
  Various departments and branch offices of the regional 
foreign trade company have been bold in exploring new business 
opportunities. Two new enterprises were set up with good 
results as of the end of last year, and five other ventures are 
being studied. In 1993, the autonomous region's foreign trade 
center used more than 600,000 yuan of long-stocked funds and 
realized a total profit of 10 million yuan. It changed the 
situation of suffering losses in previous years. The foreign 
trade company also acts as an agent to handle import business 
for units in various areas of the region. It has signed 
contracts with foreign companies totalling $3.696 million, of 
which the Yanghu Power Station accounted for $2.07 million, and 
$2.087 million have been utilized.

published in the 28 China Daily Report on page nine with the 
following report] 
  [Text] Jerusalem, 27 Jan (XINHUA) -- 'Oded Ben-'Ami, 
spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister Rabin, 
announced here this evening that Rabin had accepted the 
recommendation of the Israeli military and gave the Israeli Air 
Force his concurrence to purchase 20 F-15I jet fighters 
manufactured by the U.S. McDonnell Douglas company. 
  The F-15I jet fighter is another model of the F-15E, which 
McDonnell Douglas builds especially for Israel. Many consider 
the F-15E the most advanced fighter in the world today. 
  Ben-'Ami said purchasing the F-15I fighters will improve the 
"qualitative superiority" of the Israeli Air Force. 
  Rabin's decision has put an end to the fierce two-year 
competition between McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed, with 
McDonnell Douglas Company eventually winning the $2 billion 
contract. According to the contract, the jet fighters will be 
delivered to Israel by the end of 1997.

<F P=106> [From David Healy in London] </F>
  [Text] Political relations between Beijing and London have 
sunk to a new low over Hong Kong, with an angry exchange of 
letters between senior figures in the two capitals, a British 
source has revealed. Beijing has launched a "coded" attack on 
the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) 
investigation into Sino-British relations and their effect on 
Hong Kong. The committee is preparing a report expected to 
firmly back Governor Chris Patten's reforms. The influential 
British parliamentary committee has responded by rejecting the 
Chinese attack. 
  An angry letter from the Foreign Affairs Committee of 
China's 
National People's Congress--a copy of which has been obtained by 
the SUNDAY MORNING POST--claims its British counterparts have 
"grossly interfered in the internal affairs of China and 
severely trampled upon the norms governing international 
relations" by investigating Beijing's human rights record in 
Tibet. It warns of the consequences for "bilateral relations" 
of the British parliamentarians' investigation, and threatens 
that it will "undermine the normal exchanges between the two 
parliaments". 
  "The Chinese side has done nothing to harm Britain and its 
Parliament. However, in disregard of the sound relations 
between the two parliaments, a small number of British MPs have 
grossly interfered in China's internal affairs. This has not 
only seriously hurt the national feelings of the Chinese people 
but also contravened the position of the British Government," 
the letter alleged. 
  Although ostensibly concerning the committee's investigation 
of human rights in Tibet, one senior member said they were 
taking the letter as a coded attack on their inquiry into Hong 
Kong, which recently heard evidence from Mr Patten and will this 
week question Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd on the issue. 
"Make no mistake about it. This letter is not just about 
Tibet. It's a message of how bitter the Chinese side feels 
about Hong Kong," the committee member said. 
  "They know we're going to come out in support of Chris 
Patten 
and insist in our report that there must be human rights 
safeguards in Hong Kong...this is a coded message to us about 
how they feel over our stand on Hong Kong. 
  "Our view is that the Chinese record on human rights in 
Tibet 
is one way of judging what they might do in Hong Kong," he 
added. A source said the British parliamentary committee had 
drafted a response rejecting the accusations. 
  Beijing's letter was provoked by a December 8 hearing which 
called as a witness Tashi Wangdi, foreign minister for the 
Tibetan government in exile, headed by the Dalai Lama. China 
does not recognise the Dalai Lama's government, and frequently 
protests against the activities of its members in foreign 
countries. 
  "The Foreign Affairs Committee allowed its hearing to be 
used 
by the so-called `witness' to shamelessly deny China's 
sovereignty over Tibet and flagrantly advocate the independence 
of Tibet. The political motive of the committee in doing so was 
all too clear," the letter said. "Such an act of the committee 
constituted open support of and connivance with the political 
activities of the Dalai clique aimed at opposing the Chinese 
Government and splitting the motherland."

be able to explain to them how the British Government sees the 
way forward. I think that I won't go into any detail about 
that, but, as you know, the British Government is firmly 
attached to the Joint Declaration; we want to work with China to 
bring about a smooth transition in 1997; and we are ready to 
resume talks about the matters still remaining to be dealt with 
on the Legco [Legislative Council] elections if the Chinese side 
is prepared to do so. [end recording]

  [Text] The ROC [Republic of China] may build an airport, a 
port, and a lighthouse on the disputed Spratly Islands to 
underscore its claim of sovereignty over them. A ranking 
official with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications 
said Monday [24 January] from a political standpoint, it is 
feasible to go ahead with such project even though there may be 
no economic benefit. ROC Marines maintain a base on Taiping, an 
islet in the Spratlys. The South China islands are claimed 
wholly or in part by Brunei, Mainland China, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. 
  An ROC study group of officials and experts toured Taiping 
for about three weeks last November, and it has started to make 
a formal proposal on airport (?to be published in the media) 
later this year. Officials said the government plans to develop 
tourism on the Spratlys and has yet to resolve problems with 
accommodations and water supply.
