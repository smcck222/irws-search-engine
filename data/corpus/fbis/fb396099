  [Excerpts] At the Stanford Hotel on the afternoon of 27 
January, the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce 
sponsored a meeting on Henan Province's foreign economic 
cooperation and investment environment. Henan provincial party 
Secretary Li Changchun briefed the participants on the 
province's investment environment and expressed a warm welcome 
to Singapore industrialists and businessmen's cooperating with 
Henan. [passage omitted] 
  Li Changchun's written speech was distributed to the 
participants. Li Changchun also explained to them Henan's five 
favorable conditions for the introduction of foreign investment. 
  First, Henan is located in the central plains and has 
convenient railway and highway transportation facilities and 
three civilian airports: Zhengzhou Airport, Luoyang Airport, 
and Nanyang Airport. Zhengzhou International Airport is still 
under construction and will be completed in 1996. 
  Second, it has a variety of mineral resources. Its outputs 
of farm products, industrial crops, and animal husbandry rank in 
the forefront of the country. It has adequate electric power 
supply. 
  Third, it has a long history and beautiful mountains and 
rivers and is rich in cultural relic resources. 
  Fourth, it is rich in labor resources and has low labor 
costs 
and hard-working and honest people. 
  Fifth, the two high-tech development zones in Zhengzhou and 
Luoyang, which have been approved by the State Council, provide 
good environments for foreign investors in Henan. The State 
Council has also provided Zhengzhou City with the preferential 
policies offered to Chinese open coastal areas. In addition, we 
have the same language for communication with each other, 
similar cultures, and the same habits and customs. This is also 
a favorable condition. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nanning, 23 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Lei Yu, 
vice chairman of the Guangxi Autonomous Region Government, said: 
The volume of border trade between Guangxi and Vietnam exceeded 
2.3 billion yuan last year. Standing at over 1 billion yuan, 
export volume was slightly more than the import volume. As the 
Vietnamese side continuously raised import tariff rates for 
Chinese goods at the second half of last year, it is now more 
difficult to carry out border trade than it was before. Guangxi 
plans to turn the focus of economic cooperation with Vietnam to 
upgrading Vietnam's outdated enterprises. 
  In reply to reporters' questions a few days ago, Lei Yu 
said: 
Now that Vietnam is engaging in post-war reconstruction and 
conducting reform and opening up, Guangxi has become the most 
favorable place in China to do business with Vietnam. In his 
view, trade contacts between the two countries are beneficial to 
both parties and some of the outstanding issues in border trade 
can be resolved through consultation. 
  Lei pointed out: In the past, when China and Vietnam had 
intimate relations, China helped Vietnam build a large number of 
industrial projects. The equipment of these enterprises is now 
very old and needs to be renovated, while China's manufacturing 
technology, managerial expertise, and equipment technology are 
most suitable to the existing level in Vietnam. Guangxi is 
currently holding talks with Vietnam on helping them renovate 
those projects. 
  Lei disclosed: Guangxi has successfully helped Vietnam 
upgrade a chemical fertilizer plant, expanding the plant's 
annual production capacity from 20,000 metric tons to 100,000 
metric tons. It has also helped them build a fairly large 
modern market in Haiphong, Vietnam. Moreover, Guangxi plans to 
hold a commodity fair in Ho Chi Minh City very soon to further 
promote Chinese products in Vietnam.

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- While meeting with 
Secretary General Enrique Correa Rios of the Chilean Government 
this afternoon at Diaoyutai State Guest House, Qian Qichen, 
State Council vice premier and foreign minister, expressed the 
belief that the traditional friendly relationship between China 
and Chile will continue to develop constantly. He also hoped 
that the two countries would carry out more extensive 
cooperation in the area of international affairs. 
  Qian Qichen appreciated the Chilean Government's resolute 
pursuit of the "one China" and nonintervention in other 
countries' internal affairs policies. He recalled President 
Yang Shangkun's successful visit to Chile in 1990 and Chilean 
President Aylwin's successful visit to China in 1992. He said 
the two countries have made big strides in economic development. 
He said these have provided excellent prospects for both sides 
to further carry out mutually beneficial cooperation in diverse 
forms and through various channels. 
  On behalf of the Chilean Government, Correa congratulated 
China for its diplomatic achievements in recent years. He said 
China has played an important role in promoting peace and 
development in Asia and in the world. China has consistently 
stood for adopting peaceful means to settle international 
disputes. Internationally, reform and opening up have won honor 
and prestige for China. 
  Correa added that the Chilean Government would strive to 
further strengthen ties with China in various fields. 
  Qian Qichen and Correa also exchanged views on the 
international situation. 
  Correa arrived in Beijing for a goodwill visit on the 
evening 
of 31 January at the Chinese Government's invitation. 
  Tomorrow, Correa and his party will leave Beijing and visit 
Shanghai and Shenzhen.

  [Text] The British side of the Joint Liaison Group's 
airport committee yesterday presented China with the Hong Kong 
Government's latest Chek Lap Kok funding proposal. British 
officials are hoping a meeting can be held and an agreement 
reached before the end of the month. They also hope the issue 
will not be complicated by the Government's tabling of the 
remaining part of the 1994/95 electoral bill in the Legislative 
Council. 
  The Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office was also given an outline of the proposal by the British 
Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren. "The new offer is a 
very good one and ought to be acceptable to the Chinese side," 
Mr McLaren said. 
  Zhang Junsheng, a vice director of the Hong Kong branch of 
Xinhua (the New China News Agency), said the Chinese side needed 
to study the new offer before making any comment. But Mr Zhang 
criticised Governor Chris Patten for saying the new financing 
package was an excellent Lunar New Year present. "This is not a 
present he gives us. It belongs to Hong Kong. All (we) hope is 
just that he will not misspend the money," Mr Zhang said. Mr 
Patten yesterday pledged that the Government would not reduce 
spending on public projects in order to pay for the airport. 
  Meanwhile, the Liberals' airport spokesman, Steven Poon 
Kwok-lim, said yesterday the party would support the latest 
airport financing proposal. Mr Poon said, under the proposal, 
the debt-equity ratio would be even lower than their suggested 
1:1, much lower than other projects. It is understood that the 
Executive Council on Tuesday endorsed the fourth financing 
proposal, which will see the Government's injection to the 
airport project increase by $15 billion to $60 billion.

<F P=106> [Reports by Louis Ng, Connie Law, Josephine Ma, So Lai-Fun, </F>
Fanny Wong, and Agatha Ngai] 
  [Text] Only China could clear all the worries surrounding 
the controversial issue of right of abode in Hong Kong after 
1997, Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey said yesterday. 
Speaking at the end of a two-hour Legco [Legislative Council] 
debate last night, Mr Asprey said it remained necessary for 
China to clarify the definition of "Chinese national", which was 
a key concept in determining who would be entitled to right of 
abode in the territory after the handover. 
  Mr Asprey said the Government had presented comprehensive 
proposals to Beijing to amend the Immigration Ordinance to make 
sure it fell in line with the Basic Law. He also revealed that 
the Hong Kong Government had had informal talks on the subject 
with China and further talks would be held in the territory this 
month. "We have put comprehensive proposals to the Chinese 
through the Joint Liaison Group," he said. 
  But it remained China's responsibility to clarify its law in 
order to spell out who would be entitled to such a right. 
"Apart from anything else, right of abode on the first of July, 
1997, can be determined only by reference to a person's 
nationality," he said. "And only the Chinese Government can 
clarify Chinese Nationality Law." "We have already held 
informal talks on this subject and further talks will be held in 
Hong Kong later this month," he said. 
  The problem of right of abode of those Hong Kong Chinese 
residents who held second passports had attracted great public 
concern after it was revealed that such people would be 
considered "non-Chinese" under Chinese law. The group, 
estimated to amount to 400,000, would need to re-acquire the 
right of abode under the Basic Law. So far, Britain and China 
had failed to agree on a set of concrete arrangements under 
which people with second passports could be entitled to regain 
the right of abode. 
  Mr Asprey reiterated that the Government supported an 
arrangement which was "simple and straightforward". Speaking on 
the issuing of the future Special Administrative Region (SAR) 
passports, Mr Asprey said there were "clear advantages" for the 
Immigration Department to be allowed to do so. "There are clear 
advantages for a smooth transition in Hong Kong travel documents 
continuing to be issued by the Immigration Department. They 
have the experience, the expertise and the records necessary for 
this task," he said. 
  Director of Immigration Lawrence Leung Ming-yin said last 
month that it would take at least three years to devise a system 
to issue the SAR passports before the change of sovereignty. 
  Liberal Party legislator Howard Young, whose motion to urge 
the Government to take positive steps to ensure freedom of 
travel after 1997 was unanimously passed, suggested setting up a 
separate "passport agency". He said the agency would act as a 
processing centre for SAR passport applications on behalf of the 
future SAR government. 
  "Whilst China may view passport issue as a matter involving 
sovereignty and feel reluctant to be seen to be asking a foreign 
government to act on its behalf, a 'passport agency' could be a 
neutral medium to whom certain tasks could be delegated." Mr 
Young, who represents the tourism industry, urged China 
immediately to tackle the task of issuing SAR passports in a 
"timely and pragmatic way". 
  At the moment, British Dependent Territory Citizen and 
British National Overseas passport holders enjoy visa free entry 
to more than 70 countries. "To process hundreds of thousands of 
passport applications requires resources, The Immigration 
Department processes 49,000 passports and (Certificates of 
Identity) a month. This means it would take 11 months to issue 
even if only one-tenth of Hong Kong's population wanted an SAR 
passport." 
  United Democrat legislators, on the other hand, echoed Mr 
Asprey's comments and urged China to clarify the criteria under 
which Hong Kong Chinese with a second passport could be regarded 
as permanent resident after 1997. United Democrats James To 
Kun-sun said the future arrangement should be "open, fair and 
simple". 
  Another United Democrat, Dr Huang Chen-ya, who holds an 
Australian passport, said the two governments should immediately 
clarify the grey area in the Basic Law. "These grey areas might 
be manipulated by radical racialists to discriminate against 
those who hold a foreign passport," he said. 
  Maverick independent Chim Pui-chung asked whether Governor 
Chris Patten would fight for the right for the 1.2 million 
Certificate of Identity holders to obtain visa-free entry to 
Britain.

  [Text] Secretary for Economic Services Gordon Siu 
Kwing-chue, who went "missing" for three days in Beijing, told 
yesterday how he spent his own money on a private trip to China 
to witness the signing of an air traffic controllers' training 
accord. When his secretive manner was challenged, he said: "I 
didn't go to Beijing on taxpayers' money. I paid for the ticket 
with my own money, thanks." 
  Mr Siu avoided all outside contacts while in the Chinese 
capital and even changed hotels to evade journalists. Even Sir 
Robin McLaren, British Ambassador to China, was not informed of 
his trip. 
  Contrary to government statements which said the secretary 
was on an official visit to Beijing, Mr Siu said that he went to 
Beijing in his personal capacity because he was advised by China 
to do so just before he left. Mr Siu said he only drew money 
from his own pocket after the last-minute notice from the 
Chinese side. "At first I wanted to go in my capacity as 
Secretary for Economic Services but on the day I left I was 
asked to go in a private capacity, so I bought my own ticket." 
  He said he had paid for his hotel fees, food and drinks. 
"But I haven't counted how much I have spent yet, I don't 
know," he said. But Director of Civil Aviation, Peter Lok 
Kung-nam, who was there to sign the accord with his counterpart 
in the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), he had 
gone in his official capacity and all the expenses were paid 
from public coffers. 
  Mr Siu said he also deliberately kept a low profile during 
the visit because he respected the request to do so by his host, 
the CAAC. "In Beijing, we were asked to treat it as a technical 
issue and to keep as low a profile as possible. And so we 
respected our host's wishes." He said the Chinese side did not 
give any reason for that but that he accepted it. "I thought of 
briefing the press in the Beijing hotel but as the authority 
there had requested me to keep a low profile, I decided to tell 
the public only when I returned." 
  Mr Siu denied he had been in touch with any Chinese 
officials 
about the airport proposal. "I only had one working day which I 
spent with my friends at CAAC." He said the airport financial 
package should be discussed through diplomatic channels. Asked 
if he was aware of public worries that there would be secret 
deals with China, Mr Siu said: "I have no secrets. I went 
because I promised CAAC that I would go."

<F P=106> [By Chen Wei-ming (7115 1792 0682): "Will China Change the </F>
Method of Recovering Hong Kong?"] 
  [Text] Sources in Beijing said that after the Fifth 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress Standing 
Committee late last year, a high-ranking Chinese official denied 
that China's approach to the Hong Kong issue was "too right" 
when he met with the committee members from the military. He 
said that the Chinese Government had long prepared against the 
possible disruptive and undermining actions by the British Hong 
Kong authorities and had adopted corresponding countermeasures. 
  The official said: Britain unilaterally violated the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration and flagrantly denied the 
existence of agreements between the two governments. This fully 
showed that Britain was not willing to return Hong Kong to China 
and was still attempting to continue its colonial rule by 
playing the political card, the economic card, and the 
international card during the remaining three years. The 
British Hong Kong authorities are fostering a batch of 
pro-British people who oppose everything China advocates and 
does, trying to make them Britain's future proxies in Hong Kong, 
through whom Britain may continue to influence the future 
special administrative region [SAR] government to resist 
implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy and to 
create political disputes. This is the crucial point of the 
issue. 
  He added: When doing this, the British Hong Kong Government 
made a totally wrong assessment of the situation. China's 
determination to recover Hong Kong is firm. China will never 
barter away its principles. We will rely on the vast number of 
Hong Kong compatriots who love the motherland and love Hong Kong 
and unite all forces that can be united, including foreigners 
who want to seek development in Hong Kong, to jointly maintain 
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. The Chinese Government 
will continue to adopt policies to maintain Hong Kong's 
stability. 
  The sources also said that an authoritative person in 
Beijing 
law circles recently said that China may consider changing the 
time and method of recovering Hong Kong if the following 
situations occur: 
  First, Britain plans to change Hong Kong into an 
international political city and a center of international 
political disputes. 
  Second, Britain introduces other foreign forces to meddle in 
Hong Kong's affairs, thus turning Hong Kong's affairs into 
international affairs. 
  Third, Britain fosters a pro-Britain and anti-China 
political 
force to create trouble in Hong Kong and helps it enter the 
local power structure. 
  Fourth, Britain encourages the pro-Britain and anti-China 
political forces to disrupt order and create political incidents 
in Hong Kong. 
  Fifth, Britain supports collaboration between the 
pro-Britain 
and anti-China force in Hong Kong and the international 
anticommunist forces in creating political incidents in Hong 
Kong. 
  Sixth, Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities stir up 
political turmoil in the late transitional period to oppose the 
Chinese Government, oppose the Basic Law, and oppose the end of 
colonial rule. 
  Seventh, Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities 
deliberately create financial and monetary disorder in Hong Kong 
  Eighth, in the late transitional period, if the Hong Kong 
Government is paralyzed, while riots occur and the situation 
goes out of control. 
  Ninth, if Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities 
collude with Taiwan in turning Hong Kong into a self-governing 
political entity or a semi-independent entity.

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- Tang Shubei, executive 
vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait [ARATS], and Zou Zhekai, vice chairman and secretary 
general of the ARATS, held the second round of working 
discussions this afternoon with Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho], vice 
chairman and secretary general of Taiwan's Strait Exchange 
Foundation [SEF] on implementing the agreements of the "Wang-Gu 
[Ku] talks." The discussions made some progress. In addition, 
the two sides exchanged opinions on how to place the relevant 
economic topics on the agenda. 
  Giving a briefing to reporters at the end of the discussions 
today, Tang Shubei said: The two sides pragmatically and 
earnestly discussed relevant issues concerning the 
implementation of the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks," 
and made progress in two aspects. The two sides confirmed the 
"Agreement on Establishing a System of Making Contacts and 
Holding Talks Between the Two Organizations," and reached 
unanimity on the procedure on facilitating mutual visits by 
personnel of the two organizations in accordance with the 
agreement. The two sides would strive to make the agreement 
effective on 4 February after the wordings are checked. The two 
sides agreed that ARATS Deputy Secretary General Sun Yafu and 
relevant personnel would hold further discussions with SEF 
Deputy Secretary General Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu] and relevant 
personnel, on the common understanding on three routine issues 
reached during the ARATS-SEF talks in Taibei [Taipei] and on 
issues concerning the Tang Shubei-Jiao Renhe talks. In 
addition, the two sides exchanged opinions in general on how to 
place on the agenda the relevant economic topics specified in 
the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks." ARATS Deputy 
Secretaries Zhao Zhengyu and Li Yafei, as well as SEF Deputy 
Secretary General Shi Qiping [Shi Chi-ping], were separately 
appointed to form a working group to exchange opinions tomorrow. 
  As Jiao Renhe and his entourage visited Beijing 
Municipality's Zhongguan Village New Technological and 
Industrial Development Experimental Zone this morning, this 
afternoon's discussions opened with Jiao Renhe's impressions of 
Zhongguan Village. Jiao Renhe said he was deeply impressed by 
the village and felt that there was very great potential for the 
village's development. He said: During the visit, I saw Mr. 
Jiang Zemin's inscriptions for the experimental zone: "Bring 
into play the intelligence and wisdom of Chinese intellectuals 
to develop high technology industries and advance toward the 
21st century." Jiao Renhe felt that the statement was well 
made. If the intelligence and wisdom of the Chinese people were 
brought into play, China would definitely develop more 
vigorously. Jiao Renhe said: The process of Taiwan's economic 
development is also the experience of the Chinese people in 
bringing into play their intelligence and wisdom. While the 
mainland may draw on some of these experiences for reference, 
Taiwan too needs to learn from the mainland in some aspects. 
Tang Shubei said: The development of the people-run Zhongguan 
Village's scientific and technological undertakings is an 
achievement of the mainland's reform and opening up. Each of 
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait possesses its own advantages 
in science and technology. The mainland has numerous 
achievements in scientific and technological researches but has 
not done enough in transforming them into commercial products. 
Taiwan has done a very good job in transforming scientific and 
technological achievements into commodities. If the two sides 
could learn from each other and strengthen their cooperation, it 
would definitely be conducive to the joint promotion of 
cross-strait scientific and technological undertakings. 
  During the discussions, Tang Shubei gave a fairly detailed 
briefing on the mainland's advocation on developing cross-strait 
economy, and forwarded suggestions on ways to strengthen 
cross-strait economic cooperation. Tang Shubei said: We feel 
that all the various agenda items specified by the "Joint 
Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks" should be implemented. 
Currently, cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation is 
an important content in cross-strait relations. Last year's 
cross-strait economic and trade exchanges showed that increased 
Taiwanese investments in the mainland is helpful to the 
mainland's economic development. On the other hand, Taiwan's 
ability to maintain a foreign trade surplus is also directly due 
to the development of indirect cross-strait trade. It has been 
proven in practice that the principle determined by the "Wang-Gu 
talks"; that is, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should 
strengthen cross-strait economic exchanges as well as supplement 
and benefit each other, is correct. The two organizations 
should be responsible to the people on both sides of the strait 
and should hold consultations on relevant issues at an early 
date. 
  During the discussions, both sides felt that cross-strait 
cultural exchanges should be further broadened. The ARATS 
thanked the SEF for warmly receiving responsible persons of 
seven central press units during their visit at the beginning of 
this year. The ARATS will continue to send responsible persons 
and senior journalist delegations from the mainland's press 
units to Taiwan for visit, and is ready to warmly receive visits 
to the mainland by responsible persons of Taiwan's mass media. 
The ARATS will also promote cross-strait exchanges and mutual 
visits between young people and students. 
  Replying to a reporter's question, Tang Shubei said: The 
experiences in cross-strait cooperation among the mass 
organizations in the past three years have shown that it is 
feasible to avoid [hui bi 0932 6699] sensitive political issues 
at this stage. In accordance with this principle, the two sides 
signed the "Jinmen [Quemoy] Agreement" and "Agreement on the Use 
and Verification of Notary Certificates Between the Two Sides of 
the Strait." It has been proven that if the two organizations 
were sincere to solve problems and insisted on the principle of 
holding discussions on people-to-people basis, ways of solving 
routine problems acceptable to the two sides could be found. 
  While giving a briefing to reporters on the discussions, 
Jiao 
Renhe said: At today's discussions, the two organizations 
exchanged opinions on the three agenda items in their Taibei 
talks. The discussions of the two sides were quite specific and 
their exchange of views was very thorough. The two sides 
expressed their wishes to find ways for solving problems. He 
expressed the hope that more progress would be achieved during 
the next two days' discussions.

  [Text] Beijing, February 2 (XINHUA) -- A document will be 
formulated to include the understanding reached between the 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on 
the mainland and the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation 
(SEF) after their meetings in Beijing. 
  Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of ARATS, and Chiao 
Jen-ho, vice chairman and secretary general of SEF, made the 
remarks at a press conference right after their meeting here 
this afternoon. It was the second meeting between the two side 
since Chiao Jen-ho arrived here Monday. Zou Zhekai, vice 
president and secretary general of ARATS, was also in attendance. 
  The name of the document, or the declaration, has not been 
decided yet, the said. 
  The document will consist of two major aspects: first, 
important understanding reached between the two organs during 
this talk, including "to continue to insist on the 
non-governmental nature of the discussions and that neither side 
should force upon the other its political viewpoints in 
discussions of such issues as the repatriation of plane 
hijackers"; secondly, visible progress in discussion of the 
issues of the repatriation of hijackers, the treatment of 
maritime fishing disputes, and repatriation of other personnel 
who have crossed the straits in violation of relevant 
regulations. 
  Both sides regarded their meeting as being harmonious and 
frank and sad that the gap between them is shortening after 
exchange of views. 
  Deputy secretary generals of the two organizations will team 
up two working groups and start to discuss concerned details 
tomorrow. 
  Tang reiterated that the possibility of signing a 
non-governmental agreement in the future to guarantee the 
investment on both sides is not excluded. 
  The premise for realizing such an agreement is that Taiwan 
must open its market for manufactured or partially manufactured 
goods of the mainland, cancel restrictions on Taiwan 
businessmen's investment on the mainland and open its labor 
market, Tang pointed out. 
  He suggested that the two organs should discuss, as soon as 
possible, such issues as the rights and interests of Taiwan 
investors on the mainland and related issues, scientific and 
technological exchanges and the sponsoring of non-governmental 
economic fairs. 
  Economic exchange and cooperation has become an important 
content of the relations between the two sides across the Taiwan 
Straits, Tang noted. 
  The investment of Taiwan entrepreneurs on the mainland 
played 
a positive role in contributing to the economic prosperity of 
the mainland and the trade between the two sides reached a new 
level last year, he said. 
  In 1993, Taiwan's surplus with the United States declined, 
and its trade deficit with Japan continued to rise. However, 
its trade retained a rather large surplus last year. Tang 
pointed out that this had much to do with the soaring trade 
between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits. 
  Other sides agree that cultural and educational exchanges 
between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits should be 
broadened in principle. 
  ARATS will organize visits to the island by the mainlands 
news media officials, senior journalists and students this year, 
Tang aid. 
  At the same time, ARATS is ready to receive mass media 
officials and senior journalists and students from Taiwan, he 
said.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Li Peng is touring Guangdong to 
personally ensure that recentralisation policies announced by 
Beijing in the past fortnight will be enforced in the 
localities. However, Mr Li, who suffered a heart attack last 
year and has lost the bulk of his economic decision-making 
powers to Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, is also anxious to 
secure regional support to consolidate his power base. Sources 
in Guangdong said the premier, who flew into Guangzhou last 
week, had pledged his support for the radical reforms being 
carried out in the future-oriented province. 
  The Chinese-run Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO, reported 
yesterday that Mr Li, who usually comes to Guangdong at least 
once a year, had already visited the Pearl River estuary boom 
towns of Zhongshan and Foshan. The paper said the premier was 
anxious to get a personal understanding of supplies in the 
market and the people's living conditions before the Lunar New 
Year. 
  Sources in Guangdong said, however, that Mr Li's principal 
objective was to ensure the application of decisions to boost 
Beijing's macro-level control over the economy, which were made 
at a Politburo meeting last month. A large part of the 
recentralisation measures is aimed at reducing the authority of 
localities in making investments in capital construction and in 
fixing their own tax rates. Chinese papers yesterday quoted the 
Finance Minister, Liu Zhongli, as saying that local governments 
had no right to set their own value-added tax rates on property. 
  It is understood that Guangdong, which has among all 
provinces marketed the largest number of commercial and 
residential buildings in Hong Kong and overseas, is anxious to 
grant tax remissions to favoured customers. "Li Peng has hit 
home the point that in spite of its ability to secure 
development funds from non-governmental sources, Guangdong must 
heed central edicts on the scale of investment so as not to 
exacerbate inflation," a source said. "Moreover, the premier is 
worried about a new spate of speculation in real estate and 
stocks, as well as the opening up of development zones for which 
investments have not been secured." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Weiwei (7115 4850 0251) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 2639)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Jan (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, member of 
the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], met and had 
a discussion with leaders of religious organizations from 
various parts of the country at Zhongnanhai this afternoon. 
  Entrusted by Comrade Jiang Zemin and on behalf of the CPC 
Central Committee, Li Ruihuan first extended Spring Festival 
greetings to leaders of religious organization across the 
country and to the broad religious masses. 
  At the discussion, Li Dezhu, deputy director of the United 
Front Work Department, briefed those present on a national 
seminar of leaders of religious organizations recently held in 
Hainan. The main topic of the seminar was discussing how to 
adapt religion to a socialist society. From the standpoint of 
integrating theory with practice, participants in the seminar 
profoundly discussed the historical inevitability and 
feasibility of adapting religion to a socialist society and put 
forward some constructive opinions and suggestions in this 
regard. 
  At today's discussion, those who spoke on how to perform 
religious work more effectively and how to adapt religion to a 
socialist society included Zhao Puchu, vice chairman of the 
CPPCC National Committee and president of the Buddhist 
Association of China; Ding Guangxun, vice chairman of the CPPCC 
National Committee, chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic 
Movement Committee of Protestant Churches of China, and 
president of the Christian Council of China; Zong Huaide, 
chairman of the Chinese Catholic Bishops College and chairman of 
the China Patriotic Catholic Association; An Shiwei, president 
of the China Islamic Association; and Xie Zhongxin, vice 
chairman of the China Taoist Association. 
  In his speech at the discussion, Li Ruihuan said: The 
present situation is good in our country's religious work. In 
the past year, party and government organizations and religious 
administration departments at various levels have 
conscientiously implemented the party's religious policy, 
scoring remarkable achievements. Cooperating closely with the 
party and government, religious circles have done a lot of work 
in uniting the broad religious masses, promoting the building of 
material and spiritual civilization, maintaining social 
stability, advancing the reunification of the motherland, and 
increasing exchanges with foreign countries. 
  Li Ruihuan said: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, people across 
the country are establishing a new socialist market economic 
structure. So our religious work is now facing a new situation. 
Party and government departments at all levels should 
profoundly study, accurately understand, and conscientiously 
implement the party's religious policy, assist patriotic 
religious organizations and personages in solving practical 
difficulties and problems, and manage religious affairs 
according to law. Religious circles should actively assist the 
party and government in implementing the religious policy; unite 
and guide the religious masses to participate in reform, opening 
up, and the modernization drive; improve themselves by raising 
their quality; and learn to find their appropriate positions and 
bring their specific role into full play so as to adapt 
themselves to the new, rigorously developing situation. Li 
Ruihuan expressed the hope that religious work departments and 
religious circles would make concerted efforts to strengthen 
their ties, enhance their mutual understanding, and shape an 
ever more harmonious relationship between them in order to do 
religious work more efficiently. 
  Other leaders of religious organizations attending the 
discussion included Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Jamyang Losang Jigme 
Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, Ming yang, Dao shuren, Fu Yuantian, Li 
Yuhang, Min Zhiting, Shen Xiaxi, Abudula Damaola, Wan Yaobin, A 
Yiming, Jin luxian, Fu Tieshan, Luo Guanzong, and Shen Yifan. 
  Ismail Amat, Wang Zhaoguo, and responsible comrades of 
relevant departments also attended the discussion.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Li Tao </F>
(2621 3447) and Jiang Qianfeng (3068 6929 1496)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan (XINHUA) -- Yesterday and today, Li 
Lanqing, vice premier of the State Council, inspected education 
programs for adults and teachers in Beijing. He also held 
discussion meetings with some teachers' representatives on 
reforming and developing education programs for adults and 
teachers. 
  Li Lanqing inspected the new premises of the Beijing 
Municipal Adult Education College, teachers' families, the 
Beijing Radio and Television University, and the Beijing 
Teachers' University. He visited administrative and teaching 
personnel and examinees writing admission examinations for 
graduate programs. Li Lanqing extended his hope that the broad 
masses of administrative and teaching personnel will achieve 
better results and maintain good health in the new year, and 
wished them, in advance, a happy spring festival. 
  After ending discussion meetings with teachers' 
representatives, Li Lanqing said: Adult education is a very 
important component of China's educational undertakings. At 
present, only a small number of people are able to receive 
higher education. Yet China's current national situation 
dictates that our society needs professionals of various skills. 
Therefore, we should strive to develop vocational and adult 
education programs, including radio and television education 
programs. The road to become a professional should not be 
limited to the "difficult path" of passing through an 
institution of higher education. We should, however, construct 
more "open roads" that will enable people to become 
professionals through various channels. We should gradually 
strive to realize the objective whereby willing students will be 
able to attend school. Consequently, after completing compulsory 
education, as many people as possible may have the chance for 
further studies by attending various education programs 
including vocational, adult, and radio and television education 
programs. Only if we provide many avenues to train 
professionals can we avoid the situation whereby once children 
enter primary schools, they begin to prepare for college 
matriculation examinations and thousands of applicants try to 
squeeze through a "single-plank bridge." Only then can we avoid 
cultivating and developing so many "narrow-minded and 
nearsighted" students so that secondary and primary school 
students will truly develop morally, intellectually, and 
physically. Therefore, the issue currently facing China's adult 
education programs, including radio and television education 
programs, is not that we should weaken these programs; on the 
contrary, we should continually strive to develop them. 
  Li Lanqing said: When reforming and developing higher 
education in China, we should learn from and apply certain 
experiences in the operation of adult education programs 
including the latter's operating system, format, and methods. A 
program of higher education is not the ultimate objective. Even 
if we have a university degree, we should not regard it as the 
end of our educational progress in life. Higher education only 
provides the student with a relatively solid foundation of basic 
knowledge. Adult education programs will be mainly responsible 
for imparting special technical knowledge and for renewing an 
old knowledge base once a person joins the work force. We 
should pay attention to avoiding adult education program models 
that are "small but complete" and narrow-minded. 
  He said: Adult education programs have played an important 
role in history by supplying educational opportunities to a 
generation of people who missed their studies because they had 
been transferred to remote mountains or rural areas. China is 
establishing a socialist market economy which involves economic 
and industrial restructuring which, in turn, leads to 
corresponding restructuring in China's old macroscopic education 
formats and content. Consequently, adult education programs 
will play increasingly important roles because more people need 
to renew and supplement their existing knowledge base. When 
evaluating whether a certain education system is doing a good 
job, we should use the most basic criteria to determine whether 
the education system can cultivate and produce various 
professionals for society who are needed both now and in the 
long run. 
  Li Lanqing said: How to properly conduct socialist 
educational undertakings with Chinese characteristics is a new 
topic. As China has its own national conditions, we may refer 
to foreign countries' experiences in operating various 
educational programs, but we cannot copy them without 
reservations. We should strive to explore specific ways to 
reform and develop our educational programs in accordance with 
the requirements of "China's Program for Reforming and 
Developing its Educational Undertakings." He stressed: Leading 
cadres at various levels must change their concepts, must pay 
attention to education and truly grant it strategic importance 
so that it will receive top priority for development, and must 
respect teachers and attach importance to education. He 
reiterated: Any city or county that fails to properly operate 
its basic education programs or settle wages owed to teachers 
shall not be allowed to buy sedan cars or construct buildings of 
two or more storeys. Furthermore, leading cadres there shall be 
barred from going overseas. 
  When discussing higher education, Li Lanqing said: At 
present, in addition to gradually solving the problem of 
investment in education, institutions of higher education should 
devote their primary efforts to further raising teaching quality 
and to increasing the benefits that they bring to society; they 
should also promote educational development through working out 
reform measures. He pointed out: As the "211 Project" is a 
project in process, it is necessary to gradually bring it to 
fruition in line with stipulated standards. In addition, those 
colleges and universities which stubbornly refuse to work out 
reform measures should be barred from joining the "211 Project." 
Institutions of higher education are encouraged to help 
promote the "211 Project" through cooperating with one another, 
compensating for each other's deficiencies, and bringing their 
respective advantages into play. Colleges and universities 
should not be allowed to join the "211 Project" if the regions 
where they are situated are found to have poorly managed basic 
education. To help increase academic exchanges, further bring 
into play teachers' potential, and increase the benefits that 
schools bring to society, institutions of higher education 
should allow teachers to give lectures outside of their own 
schools on the premise that they fulfil their own teaching 
duties. 
  Li Lanqing spoke of the need to improve moral education 
[deyu 
jiaoju 1795 5148 2403 5148]. Regarding conducting education on 
national conditions, he suggested relying on and using more 
"current events" to carry out such education and called on 
leaders at all levels to enhance education on the current 
situation among faculty and students. As comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is the Marxism that integrates with the reality 
of contemporary China [shi jiehe dangdai zhongguo shiji di 
makesi zhuyi 2508 4814 0678 3981 0108 0022 0948 1395 7139 4104 
7456 0344 1835 0031 5030], we should earnestly study it. When 
conducting moral education, it is necessary to adopt different 
content and methods for different age groups. We should guard 
against "insipid" and stereotyped presentation when conducting 
moral education. Efforts shoud be made to enhance art education 
and attention paid to nurturing youngsters' noble spirit. We 
should extract the cream of 5,000 years of tradition and 
incorporate it into the spirit of the times. It is necessary to 
adopt various ways to extensively spread, popularize, and 
develop the excellent traditions of the Chinese nation. 
Accompanying Li Lanqing during the inspection were Zhang Xiaowen 
and Zhang Tianbao, vice ministers of the State Education 
Commission; Li Qiyan and Hu Zhaoguang, mayor and vice mayor of 
Beijing Municipality; and Chen Dabai, vice chairman of the 
Beijing Municipal CPPCC [Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference].

<F P=106> [By staff reporters Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li Tzu-ching </F>
(7812 5261 0079): "Deng and Chen Have a Secret Talk in 
Hangzhou"] 
  [Text] Have you ever heard of any person with three eyes, 
except for the one in the "Tales of Chinese Gods and Deities"? 
  "Yes, I have," said a writer in Beijing in a satiric tone. 
Nowadays, some people have three eyes, with one eye looking at 
money, another looking at Deng, and the other looking at Chen. 
  The reason Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun have become the focus 
of attention is that the contradictions between them always have 
a great influence on the general situation. Another reason is 
that if one of them dies, the general situation will be more 
greatly affected. People believe both will greatly affect the 
money they have earned and the way they are earning their money. 
  Thee two heads, who rarely meet, recently met in Hangzhou, 
but the meeting has been kept secret; only a small circle of top 
leaders have been informed. 
<H3>  Wan Li, Bo Yibo, and Yang Dezhong Were Present at the 
Deng-Chen Meeting </H3>
  Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun had their meeting on 8 January. 
They usually meet once or twice every year. This was proposed 
by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee 
in early November 1989 after Deng resigned his post as chairman 
of the Central Military Commission. They usually have their 
meetings in Shanghai or Hangzhou. After arriving in Hangzhou by 
special train on 8 January and having talks with Chen Yun, Deng 
Xiaoping returned to Shanghai on 10 January. Wan Li, Bo Yibo, 
and Yang Dezhong were present at the Deng-Chen meeting. 
  On 13 January, Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shanghai 
Municipal CPC Committee, conveyed the spirit of the Deng-Chen 
meeting at a meeting of the standing committee of the municipal 
CPC committee, in accordance with a document issued by the 
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee entitled "The Common 
Views and Proposals of Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun on 
the Current Internal and External Situations." 
<H3>  "The People's Bearing Capacity Should Not Be Neglected When 
Working Out Measures for Economic Reform" </H3>
  Wu Bangguo said: During their recent meeting, Comrades Deng 
Xiaoping and Chen Yun discussed the current internal and 
external situations, especially the internal situation, each 
giving his views. They held basically identical views on a 
series of issues. Both held that it is necessary to make a full 
appraisal of the people's bearing capacity so that it is not 
neglected when working out measures for economic reform; that it 
is necessary to regard strengthening party building as a very 
important task at present and to attach great importance to 
political and ideological work (to which less attention has been 
paid); that it is necessary to continue carrying out the work of 
opposing corruption, encouraging the honest performance of 
official duties, and removing obstacles; that, in light of the 
fact that such poisonous influences as money worship and the 
mentality of putting money first, are seriously affecting the 
people's thinking and socialist morality, the leading cadres 
must set a good example for the people and learn what the 
grass-roots cadres and common people are thinking, what they 
want to resolve, and what they have the greatest complaints 
about; that social and political stability will continue to be 
crucial matters for the next five to 10 years; and that the 
sovereignty and security of the state should be put first at all 
times. 
  Both the document of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat 
and the relayed report by Wu Bangguo said Deng and Chen had 
"basically identical views" on some issues, but not "entirely 
identical views." On what issues did they hold "basically 
nonidentical views" then? They said nothing about this, but Bo 
Yibo disclosed it. 
  At a forum of retired veteran cadres on 13 January, Bo Yibo 
disclosed the differences between Deng and Chen during their 
meeting. 
<H5>  Bo Yibo Discloses Differences Between Deng and Chen </H5>
  Bo Yibo said: Comrade Xiaoping and Revered Comrade Chen 
[xiao ping tong zhi he chen lao 1420 1627 0681 1807 0735 7115 
5071] had a meeting. They talked for about two hours and had 
lunch together. Their talks at the luncheon were also about the 
current situation. Deng Xiaoping stressed that reform and 
development should not stop and that people should have no 
doubts about the correctness of the policy simply because some 
problems had emerged. The problem is that the central and 
provincial leading bodies must remain clear-headed. The pace of 
development should not slow down, or China will lag behind. At 
present, the leaders should further emancipate their minds. 
They must rid their brains of the word "fear," and shake off 
the trammels of book worship within the party. Xiaoping said 
that some problems do exist among some local leading cadres, 
such as local departmentalism and local sectarianism. The main 
reason is that they do not fully understand and comprehend the 
spirit of the central authorities' line, policies, and 
principles. 
<H5>  Chen Yun's Five Criticisms Against Deng </H5>
  Bo Yibo continued: Our revered Comrade Chen stressed the 
necessity of absolute steadiness, saying that it would be a 
miracle if a healthy economic growth rate of seven percent could 
be preserved. At present, it is necessary to sum up some major 
and common problems in reform and opening up, and to study and 
resolve them one by one. He pointed out that in the current 
stage, conviction, morality, and style within the party are the 
crucial problems of the whole party and nation. Local 
departmentalism and local sectarianism, which exist to a serious 
extent throughout the country, have weakened the leadership and 
authority of the central authorities. Our revered Comrade Chen 
also pointed out that emancipation of the mind does not mean 
advocating and publicizing the spirit of "forcing a way forward" 
in disregard of our national conditions, the scientific spirit 
of seeking truth from facts. or laws, systems, and discipline. 
He pointed out that China should try to put an end to the 
passive state in Sino-U.S. trade and overcome right-opportunism 
in its U.S. policy. It should draw lessons from the fact that 
Britain has flatly violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration 
and the agreements reached between the two governments; China 
should adopt more resolute measures, including new decisions. 
  In fact, Chen Yun was criticizing Deng Xiaoping in the 
following five fields: First, unsteadiness in reform; second, 
excessive economic growth; third, no summary of work; fourth, 
"three violations" in the practice of emancipating the mind 
advocated by Deng, that is, disregarding national conditions, 
scientific spirit, and laws and systems; and fifth, right 
deviation toward the United States. 
<H5>  Chen Yun: "Once Leftism Is Criticized, Rightism Appears" </H5>
  Moreover, on another occasion, Chen Yun pointed out that 
rightism had appeared after "criticizing leftism," and 
sometimes, the criticism of leftism was wrong. 
  During a meeting with Li Lanqing at the beginning of 
January, 
Chen Yun said: In our work today, it is particularly necessary 
to pay attention to social stability and remaining cool-headed. 
I still want to pour some cold water on hotheadedness. There 
will be trouble if turbulence is aroused because of our improper 
policies and measures and because of continuous infiltration, 
subversion, and propaganda by the United States. He also 
pointed out: It is necessary to exercise control over commodity 
prices and inflation, and to continue to do a good job in 
opposing corruption and building a clean government. It is 
necessary to carry out necessary political study and moral 
education. "What I am really worrying about is the practice of 
stressing one tendency to the neglect of another, such as 
stressing criticism of leftism to the neglect of the emergence 
of rightism. Sometimes certain correct practices are criticized 
and abandoned as expressions of the leftist tendency; this is a 
dangerous trend. I often remind some comrades among the central 
authorities that the phenomenon of one tendency concealing 
another has often appeared in the party's policies and practical 
work, but we have failed to draw lessons from it." 
  During his meeting with Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping stressed the 
necessity of "shaking off the trammels of book worship within 
the party." Did he refer to the trend of book worship in Chen 
Yun? One point is clear, that is, Chen Yun believed that Deng 
Xiaoping was not entirely correct in "criticizing leftism" (in 
fact, Deng only proposed to "prevent leftism"), because by 
"criticizing leftism," "rightism" had been encouraged. We can 
be sure of this. Another point we are sure of is that the 
differences between Deng and Chen are differences in principle. 
It seems that their contradictions are unsolvable.

<F P=106> [By staff reporters Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li Tzu-ching </F>
(7812 5261 0079): "Chen Yun Favors Massive Party Rectification"] 
  [Text]The CPC Central Committee Secretariat 
circulated a letter which Chen Yun wrote to the Political Bureau 
after the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee. In the letter Chen Yun touched on 15 points, three 
of which are essential-- specifically, first, corruption of the 
party; second, the causes of corruption; and third, a suggestion 
for party rectification. 
  Chen Yun is a typical CPC member who always bears the 
party's 
fate in mind although being confined to bed all year round. 
  He has racked his brains to find a way to save the party. He 
has written to the central authorities again and again, and made 
one suggestion after another. 
  In order to save the party, he has defended 
Marxism-Leninism, 
criticized the Deng line, and lodged objections, going against 
the trend. 
  With the same motive, he recently did two things. First, he 
wrote a letter to the Political Bureau; and second, he met and 
talked with Deng Xiaoping in Hangzhou, where he was recuperating. 
  It is believed that he was trying to exert pressure by 
writing the letter and through his talks with Deng. And one 
cannot completely rule out the influence of these moves. In the 
letter to the Political Bureau he did make some sensational 
remarks too. After all Chen Yun still indulges in the illusion 
of putting the clock back to 40 years ago. 
<H5>  Chen Yun Is Afraid That the Party Will Lose Its Leadership </H5>
  On 3 January 1994 the CPC Central Committee's secretariat 
circulated a letter Chen Yun wrote to the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau after the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee. A brief note was added by the CPC Central 
Committee Secretariat upon the circulation of the letter: This 
letter Comrade Chen Yun wrote to the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau fully displays the absolute devotion of a 
revolutionary of the older generation to the cause of the party 
and the people and his utmost concern for the development of the 
party. We suggest that you conscientiously review your 
departments' conditions against this letter. Doing so will be 
beneficial to the party's work. The secretariat has circulated 
Chen Yun's letter, in the form of a special document, among the 
party committees of all the ministries, departments, 
commissions, and committees of the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council, as well as the party committees of all the 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under 
the central authorities. 
  As disclosed by the document, Chen Yun pointed out in his 
letter that the party's high priority task under the present 
complicated and drastically changing international circumstances 
is to build the party well and to pay greater attention to party 
building. If the party does not take care of the party ranks, 
they will become disunited, the party will lose its coherence 
and combative force, hence the people's support and its 
leadership. 
<H5>  "Localism and Factionalism Are Prevalent" </H5>
  Chen Yun touched on 15 issues: 
  1. As far as party building is concerned, people lack a firm 
political orientation, and they think that politics is nothing 
but empty talk. 
  2. People have basically overlooked the value of Marxist 
theory in the new period and its importance as a guide for the 
party in its work. 
  3. Not only non-Marxist ideologies exist within the party, 
but also an anti-Marxist tendency and ideological trend is 
prevailing. 
  4. In the past few years, the party basically gave up its 
efforts regarding ideological work as well as education and 
propaganda on Marxism. 
  5. As far as propaganda on reform and opening up is 
concerned, the party's propaganda department has overlooked 
propaganda and education on socialist morality and style. 
  6. Now the political quality of the ranks of party and 
government cadres and the spirit supporting them to work for the 
cause of the people and the party have seriously deteriorated. 
  7. The party spirit and sense of organization and discipline 
on the part of party members, including old party members, have 
become unprecedentedly blunted. 
  8. Localism, individualism, and factionalism have been 
prevailing and spreading unchecked among local party 
organizations and departments, which has weakened the party's 
centralized leadership and the comprehensive implementation of 
the party's principles and policies. 
<H3>  "It Is Suggested That a Comprehensive and Thorough 
Consolidation of Party Organizations Be Carried Out" </H3>
  9. Anarchism and liberalism have become common and serious 
tendencies among leading party cadres. 
  10. Money worship of the capitalist world has corroded the 
party's ranks, and the will power of CPC members has been 
weakened amid peaceful evolution. 
  11. The role of party cadres and members in influencing and 
educating their family members and relatives has become a very 
prominent issue within the party. 
  12. Some party and government departments have become so 
corrupt that not only the party's leadership has been weakened, 
but also their corrupt practices have aroused grievances and 
protests among the public. 
  13. It is suggested that both the central and local 
authorities carry out a comprehensive and thorough consolidation 
of party organizations to get rid of corrupt and degenerate 
bureaucrats and to cultivate a fine atmosphere that will help to 
promote the party and the people's interests. 
  14. It is necessary to select, from the central level and 
localities, some upright and capable comrades of strong party 
spirit and great resolution, including non-CPC members and 
comrades of advanced age but still in good health, to replenish 
discipline inspection commissions and supervisory commissions at 
all levels. 
  15. It is suggested that the interim organization--"the 
central leading anti-corruption office" be placed under the 
direct leadership of the Political Bureau Standing Committee; 
and that a thorough investigation be carried out for a period of 
time, since this operation is a task of general significance and 
top priority. 
  There are three keynotes in the 15 points raised by Chen 
Yun--namely, first, corruption within the party; second, the 
causes for corruption; and third, the suggestion for a party 
rectification. 
<H5>  Party Rectification Is Useless to Improvement of Party Style </H5>
  The so-called party rectification means "to carry out a 
relatively comprehensive and thorough consolidation with a view 
to weeding out corrupt and degenerate bureaucrats." Chen Yun 
has an extremely deep love for the party and is extremely eager 
to save the party. However, cadres in Beijing who are well 
informed of the situation do not appreciate Chen Yun's proposal. 
Instead they make a mockery of Chen Yun's hidebound thinking, 
saying that he is but "an old, stubborn conservative." 
  The CPC launched a few rounds of party rectification in the 
past. Before its rise to power, there were two major party 
rectifications, one took place from 1941 to 1945, and the other 
in 1947-48. After its rise to power, party rectifications were 
carried out during three periods, from 1950 to 1954, in 1957, 
and from 1969 to 1971. After Mao Zedong's death, another party 
rectification was conducted during 1983-87. During these major 
party rectifications, hundreds of thousands of party members 
were expelled from the party (238,000 party members were 
expelled in June 1953 alone). But has party style ever been 
improved and has party discipline ever been strengthened after 
party rectifications? To be honest, the further the party 
rectification goes, the more corrupt the party will be. Not to 
mention the previous rounds of party rectification, but let us 
take the 1983-87 party rectification as an example. This latest 
party rectification urged "fighting against all kinds of abuse 
of official power to seek personal interests." But after this 
party rectification, abuse of official power for personal 
interests has become more common among party members and cadres. 
This in turn gave rise to the mass movement against official 
profiteering, corruption, and privileges in 1989. Chen Yun now 
picks a futile remedy and expects it to work as a miraculous 
cure. This implies nothing but that the CPC has become so 
corrupt as to be incurable.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Shutang (1728 0647 1016]) </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (XINHUA) -- The State Council's 
Committee for Women and Children's Work held the second plenary 
session of its Second Committee here this afternoon to review 
women and children's work in 1993 and make work plans and 
arrangements for 1994. 
  Peng Peiyun, state councillor and chairman of the State 
Council's Committee for Women and Children's Work, asked the 
committee to carry out two major tasks and concentrate on 
several major issues to produce greater results in women and 
children's work. She said: The first major task is to 
comprehensively implement the "Outline of Development Plans for 
Chinese Children in the Nineties." This outline constitutes a 
commitment to China's vast numbers of children and to the 
international community made by Premier Li Peng on behalf of the 
Chinese Government. All units should enhance their sense of 
mission and urgency, spell out the yearly targets on the basis 
of established overall goals, and institute a system of target 
management to ensure fulfillment of each goal set forth in the 
outline. 
  She said: The second major task is to complete the draft of 
the "Outline of Development Plans for Chinese Women in the 
Nineties." The outline is intended to regulate, guide, and 
promote the development of Chinese women, safeguard their rights 
and interests, raise their standards, and enable them to 
participate more successfully in promoting equality, 
development, and peace and play a role worthy of the "other 
half" in China's modernization. The outline is also designed to 
help achieve the goals set for in the "Nairobi Strategy" and to 
greet the opening of the Fourth World Women's Congress in 1995. 
  Peng Peiyun also called for continuous efforts to publicize 
and implement laws and regulations on children and women, 
safeguard women's rights and interests in child-bearing and 
labor, launch targeted struggles against kidnapping and 
prostitution, and conduct experiments in the "three quality 
projects" [quality birth, upbringing, and education]. 
  Liu Hairong, director of the general office of the State 
Council's Committee for Women and Children's Work and vice 
president of the All-China Women's Federation, gave a report on 
the committee's work in 1993 and its plan for 1994. Committee 
members and representatives from various units discussed ways to 
further promote women and children's work. 
  It was learned that the State Council's Committee for Women 
and Children's Work made progress in safeguarding women and 
children's rights and interests and promoting women and 
children's causes last year. The committee coordinated and 
organized activities to publicize and implement the law on 
safeguarding women's rights and interests. After an 
investigation into implementation of the law in seven provinces, 
it presented its views and suggestions on existing problems and 
future work and urged departments concerned to adopt measures 
for resolving the problems. Today, two-thirds of the 
governments at the provincial level in China have established 
agencies for protecting women and children. 
  Last year, together with the Central Committee for 
Comprehensive Management of Public Security, and based on the 
experience of the last two years in the struggle against 
kidnapping and prostitution, the State Council's Committee for 
Women and Children's Work put forward requirements for carrying 
out the struggle in the next stage. This has helped deepened 
the struggle. In addition, the committee also worked actively 
to implement the "Outline of Development Plans for Chinese 
Children in the Nineties," made good preparations for enacting 
the "Outline of Development Plans for Chinese Women in the 
Nineties," and presented specific proposals on making overall 
arrangements for society to bear the burden of child-bearing 
expenses for women workers.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter: "Yang Shangkun's and </F>
Tian Jiyun's Remarks on Reform Are Worth Pondering"] 
  [Text] Recently, senior statesman Yang Shangkun and Tian 
Jiyun, vice chairman of the National People's Congress, 
separately visited Guangdong. Their statements, which differ 
from normal ones, are worth pondering. 
  A Guangdong official disclosed that Yang Shangkun met with 
provincial officials while in Guangdong. He listened to an 
account given by these officials. Yang, who has kept a 
relatively low profile since the 14th CPC Congress, talked 
volubly. He expressed support for Guangdong's reform, saying 
that the province had a correct guiding ideology, which was 
worth recommending. He particularly asked the special economic 
regions to consolidate their achievements. 
  It is said that Yang Shangkun spoke highly of Guangdong's 
proposal in the new round of reform of reestablishing the 
province's superiority, particularly the superiority of Shenzhen 
and Zhuhai, which included the tentative ideas of establishing 
the Nanhua financial center and setting up a free trade zone. 
When the question of Shanghai's Pudong was mentioned, however, 
Yang Shangkun remained silent. 
  During his visit to Shenzhen the other day, Tian Jiyun 
stressed "reform, opening up, delegation of powers, and 
flexibility," saying that herein lies the crux of mainland's 
economic development. 
  Tian Jiyun spoke highly of the recent reforms. He said that 
a market economic mechanism will be gradually introduced to 
replace the forsaken planned economic model, which was 
disadvantageous to development of productive forces. 
  Guangdong officials say that the remarks of Yang Shangkun 
and 
Tian Jiyun meant more than what they say and are worth 
pondering. It shows that there are differences within the CPC on 
a number of issues. 
  Reportedly, there are also serious differences within the 
State Council. Besides external affairs and the Three Gorges 
project, Premier Li Peng will not bother about other businesses. 
Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua argued contentiously as they shared 
different views on the capital for key construction projects. 
Qian Qichen and Li Lanqing also attended to their own business.

reporter Jia Fenyong (6328 1164 0516)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (XINHUA) -- A national work 
conference of nationalities affairs commissions was held in 
Beijing today. The conference will relay and study the 
guidelines of relevant central directives on improving 
nationalities work in the new period, review the achievements 
and experiences gained in recent years in this work, and study 
and arrange this year's nationalities work. 
  Wang Guangying, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe, and Wang Zhaoguo 
attended 
today's plenary session. Ismail Amat, state councillor and 
concurrently minister in charge of the State Nationalities 
Affairs Commission, delivered a report. He said: In recent 
years, China has made continuous progress and scored great 
success in nationalities work during the course of reform and 
opening up. After the central nationalities work conference in 
1992, various minority areas greatly expedited economic 
construction, reform, and opening up, thereby making speedy 
progress in economic construction. Township and town enterprises 
in minority areas developed greatly with the assistance of 
nationalities affairs departments at all levels. Poverty relief 
efforts in those areas yielded notable results, releasing 
approximately 250,000 people from poverty in two years. 
Minority areas made tremendous headway in various social 
services on the basis of economic development. The new type of 
socialist relationship among various nationalities was further 
consolidated and developed. People of all nationalities showed 
an even deeper love of their united and multinational 
motherland, and they worked even more conscientiously toward 
rejuvenating the Chinese nation. Meanwhile, enormous progress 
was made in instituting a legal system governing nationalities, 
resulting in the enactment and implementation of many laws and 
regulations in this regard. Relations among various 
nationalities and work regarding nationalities are being 
gradually written into laws. 
  Ismail Amat said emphatically: People engaged in 
nationalities work should seriously study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm themselves with 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
seriously study new circumstances and problems encountered by 
minority nationalities and minority areas in the course of 
establishing a socialist market economic system, energetically 
promote economic development, reform, and opening up in minority 
areas, and constantly make new contributions to the unity and 
progress of various nationalities. 
  Conferees included chairpersons of nationalities affairs 
commissions of various provinces, autonomous regions, 
municipalities directly under the central government, and cities 
with independent decision-making power; leading comrades in 
charge of work regarding nationalities from some provinces and 
autonomous regions; and responsible comrades from relevant 
departments under central state organs.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan] </F>
  [Text] Three Catholic clerics have been set free by 
Chinese authorities after they were detained by mainland police 
who wanted to stop them from meeting foreign dignitaries. 
Informed sources said yesterday Bishop Su Zhimin of Baoding, 
Hebei Province, had returned home last Saturday [30 January]. 
The sources said Trappist Father Placidus Pei Ronggui of 
Shijiazhuang and the clandestinely ordained Bishop Jia Zhiguo of 
Hebei had also "gone back home safely". 
  Sources said Bishop Su, 62, was taken away by public 
security 
officers early last month after he had had a meeting with US 
Congressmen Christopher Smith. It is not clear why Chinese 
authorities detained Bishop Jia and Father Pei at about the same 
time, but sources believed their detention was related to 
contact with foreigners. 
  The trio are well-known figures in the underground Catholic 
Church and their "disappearance" was an embarrassment to Beijing 
because it coincided with the visit by US Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bensten to Beijing last month. 
  Meanwhile, Chinese authorities confirmed yesterday to 
foreign 
diplomats they were keeping Catholic priest Zhang Li in a labour 
re-education centre in Hebei Province. Released in March last 
year, Father Zhang was rearrested in June. Catholic sources 
said he was serving a three-year sentence in a 
reform-through-education centre in Zhangjiakou in Hebei. The 
confirmation by Beijing is considered unusual because Father 
Zhang is apparently not on any foreign government's lists of 
political prisoners.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Analysis" page by Willy Wo-Lap Lam: </F>
"Party Plans To Keep All News Good News] 
  [Text] Rulers with foresight scrap outdated institutions 
in good time. Some dinosaurs collapse under their own weight 
or, as the Chinese say, because the "overall climate" has 
changed to the extent that oxygen and nutrients are hard to come 
by. Others suffer the painful fate of incremental atrophy by 
sheer force of irrelevance. 
  Last week, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) [CPC] put up a 
valiant effort to prevent its Propaganda Department and related 
yamens from going the way of absolute monarchy and primogeniture. 
  In the largest gathering of specialists in propaganda, 
ideology, culture and the media since 1957, top cadres including 
President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Propaganda Chief Ding 
Guangen spoke about ushering in a new era of propaganda through 
"the further liberation of thought" and "upholding the 
construction of spiritual civilisation". 
  As the custodians of Marxism, however, CCP chieftains should 
know that construction makes up only half of social engineering. 
The other equally crucial half consists of destruction the 
planned obsolescence of institutions that seem, to use Hong Kong 
slang, to be obstructing the movement of the Earth. 
  The problem with an administration as intent on guarding its 
turf as the CCP is that its accent has always been on 
"construction", preservation, and aggrandisement. 
  On the economic side, this has resulted in up to two-thirds 
of state enterprises and conglomerates dripping in red Ink. 
  Even before the June 4 crackdown in 1989, patriarch Deng 
Xiaoping had emphasised the double-pronged strategy of economic 
construction on the one hand, and the erection of the 
police-state apparatus and "socialist spiritual civilisation" on 
the other. 
  This "both fists be tough" credo, especially since mid-1989, 
has resulted in a mushrooming of propaganda-related units, what 
cynics call ideological or thought police whose task is to keep 
out Western spiritual opium such as democratic ideals. 
  Aside from the Propaganda Department itself, other units 
such 
as the Culture Ministry, the Ministry of Radio, Film and 
Television, state news agencies and publishing houses, as well 
as departments responsible for overseas propaganda, held 
strategy sessions last week to map plans for the 90s. 
  The agenda of these closed-door conclaves was how to 
maintain 
discipline in the ideological, media and cultural arenas after 
Mr Deng's demise. For example, precautions are being taken to 
suppress calls for political liberalisation that might appear in 
the more racy provincial papers. 
  While addressing the conclaves, President Jiang indicated 
"propaganda and ideological work" should consist of "using 
scientific theories to arm people; correct press opinion to 
guide people; lofty spirit to mould people; and superior 
artistic creations to energise people". 
  In his remarks, Mr Deng pledged the party would give up such 
Cultural Revolution-vintage measures as "mass movements" and 
"large-scale criticism campaigns" to enforce orthodoxy. "We 
will implement principles of democracy and the goal of guidance 
through respecting and understanding people, showing them 
concern and arousing their enthusiasm," he said. 
  Most of the time, however, the ideologues did not bother to 
hide behind this veil of heavy-handed patronage and noblesse 
oblige. In his talk to the propagandists, Premier Li demanded 
that editors "guard against one-sidedness" and "provide a 
correct guide to public opinion" . Presumably, a Chinese 
journalist would be guilty of "one-sidedness" if his reports 
fail to show the party in the best light. 
  Mr Deng came directly to the point in an unpublicised series 
of "dos and don'ts" he issued last weekend. "Give help (to the 
party), do not add confusion; sing the leitmotif (of socialism, 
patriotism, collectivism) and avoid cacophony; pay attention to 
social benefits and not the profit motive; observe propaganda 
discipline and do not go your own way;sharpen your focus and do 
not dissipate your energy, work hard at materialising your goals 
and do not just go for show." 
  Mr Deng did not elaborate on what constituted "cacophony" or 
"confusion". Yet Chinese media watchers said that his edicts 
were in essence no different from those endorsed by a similarly 
large-scale propaganda conclave in 1957, whose purpose was to 
launch the infamous Anti-Rightist Campaign by ridding the media 
and cultural scene of "poisonous weeds". 
  As the commissars were holding forth on the need to cleave 
to 
a reform and open-door policy in the media, authorities in 
Shanghai last week closed down four financial tabloids suspected 
of fanning speculation on the local bourse. 
  Restrictions on co-operative ventures with Hong Kong and 
foreign media and cultural companies were tightened even as the 
ban on the reception of international satellite TV programmes 
continued. In spite of Mr Deng's commitment to "using well the 
modern mass media", his department has killed uncountable 
proposals by enterprising cadres and businessmen to start 
quasi-private newspapers, magazines and TV stations. 
  It never crossed the mind of the ideological inspectors 
that, 
six years shy of the 21st century, it would no longer do for a 
propaganda machine which reports to only one faction of a 
political party with a declining number of practising members to 
tell a nation of 1.15 billion what to read and what to watch on 
television. 
  Or perhaps the incongruity has become apparent even to 
cadres 
inured to the mores of the Yanan caves. In a conversation in 
English between the politburo's leading linguist, Mr Jiang, and 
Political Consultative Conference member Israel Epstein a year 
ago, the President expressed dissatisfaction that the Chinese 
word xuanchuan ("to publicise, propagate, and conduct 
propaganda") had invariably been translated as propaganda. "Can 
we look for a more neutral, less stilted (English) term?" Mr 
Jiang reportedly asked. 
  The fault, however, is with the party. Since the 30s, CCP's 
translators have identified their Xuanchuan Bu as the Propaganda 
Department, and its work as making propaganda. Some 
bourgeois-liberal wags within the party have suggested 
converting the Xuanchuan Bu into a Public Relations Department. 
But then PR professionals do not usually take such draconian 
steps as banning books or kicking avant-garde writers out of 
political parties.

<F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has amended its radical development 
strategy for 1994 by putting emphasis on social stability. The 
change, recently decided by the Chinese Communist Party's 
leadership, is to avert social unrest in the face of increasing 
inflationary and unemployment pressures following sweeping 
reforms. The ruling party's Politburo made the decision last 
month in an emergency meeting after price hikes for grain and 
staple food in major cities and an expected "largest-ever" flow 
of migrants this month. 
  The strategic amendment in socio-economic development and 
reform policies received blessing from paramount leader Deng 
Xiaoping, Chinese sources said yesterday. The change was made 
to include "guaranteeing social stability" as development 
priority and play down the emphasis on pace of economic growth 
and reform. 
  The decision has sharply contrasted the policy and remarks 
made by senior leaders last year when they were working on an 
overall development, economic sources told THE HONGKONG 
STANDARD. At that time, the Politburo had formulated a 
three-point directive outlining the development strategy for 
1994, which says "to seize opportunities, deepen reforms and 
speed up development". But now, the Politburo has changed it to 
"seize opportunities, deepen reforms, boost development and 
guarantee stability" a well-informed source said. 
  The inclusion of guaranteeing social stability indicates 
that 
the authorities are to postpone many of its radical reforms and 
take a more cautious step in the endeavour. The substitution of 
"speeding up development" by "boosting development" also 
underlines a change of mind by the leadership. 
  Only last year senior leaders frequently quoted an 
instruction of the reclusive Mr Deng to justify a fast pace 
development. The patriarch was reported to have said then that 
"development is hard truth" and "slow development is not 
socialism." The remark was interpreted as advocacy for a higher 
development speed. 
  The decision will allow China to cut its growth rate to rein 
in spiralling inflation. The government will suspend some 
reform packages that may have fuelled price soaring for basic 
products and staples and lead to large-scale unemployment. It 
will re-impose price capping over the floor and grip in economic 
activities, including renewing austerity program, sources said.

  [Text] Regional officials are mapping out strategies to 
force Beijing to roll back its recentralisation measures at the 
second plenary session of the Eighth National People's Congress, 
which opens in Beijing on March 10. Chinese sources said local 
cadres were waiting for instructions that patriarch Deng 
Xiaoping might give in the run-up to Lunar New Year next week, 
which he is expected to celebrate in Shanghai . 
  Since 1991, Mr Deng has used his public appearance on Lunar 
New Year Day to speak out in favour of regional administrations 
"going as fast as they can". The sources said leaders from 
coastal provinces had been nonplussed by retrenchment policies 
announced by the central leadership over the past fortnight. 
For example, Beijing has urged regional cadres to observe the 
national target of nine percent growth rate for 1994. 
  The semi-official China News Service last night quoted 
Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji as scolding unnamed local 
officials for going after disruptively ambitious goals. "The 
major risk (for the national economy) is the excessively large 
scale of fixed-assets investments," Mr Zhu said. "Some people 
are very eager to overtake (others), to mount projects and to 
spread themselves out. This tendency must be changed." 
  Central authorities have since last month taken back the 
authority to grant permission for most types of fixed-assets 
investments. The Chinese press yesterday quoted the 
vice-governor of Guangdong, Lu Ruihua, as saying his province 
would observe Beijing's new structures. Projects would only be 
approved if the partners involved have sufficient funding, 
including recurrent expenses. 
  Privately, however, individual cadres and heads of state 
companies along the coast have expressed a desire to beat 
central directives. Officials in Hainan, Guangzhou, Hebei and 
Pudong have announced growth targets for this year of 18 
percent, 16 percent, 14 percent and 30 percent respectively. 
Local cadres and businessmen have indicated they would ignore 
Beijing's fiats if they could secure financing from overseas or 
if they could raise funds "directly from society". 
  Chinese sources said at the congress, deputies representing 
the provinces would also try to force Beijing to moderate the 
so-called dual-tax system introduced on January 1. For example, 
the legislators would lobby the central Government to return a 
larger portion of its increased tax revenues to the regions in 
the form of transfer payments. 
  The pro-Chinese Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO, yesterday 
quoted 
senior Guangdong officials as indicating they had boosted their 
contributions to national funds. The province's contributions 
to Beijing jumped by 7.4 times from 1980 to 1992, while total 
tax revenues had increased by just 6.1 times in the same period. 
Guangdong cadres also stated throughout the 1980s more than 20 
billion yuan (HK$17.76 billion)--or 40 percent of local fiscal 
income in the period--had been used to serve the cause of reform.

<F P=106> [XINHUA "Mailbox" feature: "What Are Civil Rights"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- Civil rights are rights 
enjoyed by civil subjects in a concrete relationship with civil 
laws. Civil rights are rights protected by the coercive power 
of the state. 
  In accordance with laws and regulations, citizens and legal 
persons are entitled to many kinds of civil rights. According 
to different standards, civil rights can be classified into 
various categories: 
  1. Personal rights and property rights (classified according 
to whether or not civil rights are directly composed of 
property). 
  Personal rights are civil rights which are inalienable from 
the subject of the rights and do not consist of property. 
Personal rights are also called non-property personal rights. 
Personal rights can also be classified into personality rights 
and right of status. The former is a civil right that is 
inalienable from the civil subject and is in force throughout 
the period of his existence. The latter is a civil right whose 
existence is based on a definite relationship of status. 
  Property rights are civil rights that have material content 
and directly embody economic benefit. Property rights mainly 
include ownership, creditor's rights, and inheritance rights. 
  Under some circumstances, personal rights and property 
rights 
are combined. For example, intellectual property rights include 
both property rights and personal rights. 
  2. Absolute right and relative right (classified according 
to 
the scope of obligatory subjects involved in civil rights). 
  Absolute right, also called right in rem, refers to 
obligations which all persons other than the subject of the 
right shall not interfere with or violate. Therefore, as a 
general rule, the exercise of absolute right does not depend on 
the action of an obligatory subject. Personal rights and 
property rights are both absolute rights. Their exercise does 
not depend on actions initiated by other persons. 
  Relative right, also called right in personam, refers to the 
right enjoyed by the subject of a particular right to the 
subject of a particular obligation. As a general rule, the 
exercise of relative right depends on actions intitiated by the 
subject of a particular obligation. Creditor's right is a 
relative right, which finds its expression in the fact that only 
the creditor has a right to claim payment from the debtor, and 
his right as a creditor can only be realized by the debtor's 
fulfillment of his obligation. 
  It should be noted that all civil rights, being not above 
the 
law, are limited and restricted. Absolute and relative rights 
do not mean such rights are absolute or relative. They are 
classified in accordance with the scope of obligatory subjects 
who are under the restriction of the rights, that is, whether 
they refer to a particular person or not. 
  3. Right of petition and right of initiative (classified 
according to function). 
  Right of petition refers to a right by which the subject of 
the right makes other persons undertake or not undertake a 
certain action. Creditor's right is a right of petition. 
  Right of initiative refers to the right by which the subject 
of the right brings about changes in the effect of a civil law 
through his own actions. The right of referendum and right of 
recall are rights of initiative. 
  4. Primary right and secondary right (classified according 
to 
the degree of interrelatedness and interdependence of civil 
rights). 
  Among two or more interrelated and interdependent civil 
rights, the one whose independent existence does not depend on 
any other civil rights is called a primary right; the one whose 
existence is based on the premise of other civil rights or 
depends on other civil rights is called a secondary right. For 
example, mortgage right is a secondary right, while creditor's 
right, which is guaranteed by mortgage right, is a primary 
right. Mortgage right has been established to guarantee the 
primary claim. The existence of mortgage right depends on the 
primary creditor's right; when the latter ceases to exist, 
mortgage right also ceases to exist. 
  China's "General Code of Civil Law" stipulates that a legal 
person's legitimate civil rights and interests are protected by 
law from violation by any organization or individual. While 
confirming and protecting the legitimate rights of civil 
subjects, the "General Code of Civil Law" demands that the civil 
subject exercise his civil rights in accordance with law. 
  Civil rights consist of certain interests. When the owner of 
such rights realizes these interests, he exercises his rights. 
When the owner of such rights realizes the content of the 
rights, through certain action performed by himself or someone 
else, he exercises civil rights. Civil rights can only be 
enjoyed by their owner; but civil rights can be exercised by 
someone else. This is the main difference between exercising 
civil rights and enjoying civil rights. 
  The legitimate civil rights and interests of citizens and 
legal persons are protected by law. No one is allowed to 
violate such rights and interests. Persons who violate the 
legitimate civil rights and interests of citizens and legal 
persons shall bear legal responsibility according to law. When 
his civil rights are violated, the owner of such rights is 
entitled to ask his violators to stop such violation and 
compensate for the losses. He can also request, through 
administrative procedure, relevant government departments to 
protect his rights or directly initiate legal action with the 
people's court and ask for protection. Lawsuit protection is 
the most effective legal protection for civil rights.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Stunned by Western criticism of its proposed law on 
eugenics, the Chinese Government is revising the draft 
legislation in an attempt to make it less contentious, according 
to Beijing sources. The original draft, submitted to the 
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee for 
deliberation last December appeared to advocate the forced 
sterilisation of mentally and physically disabled people and led 
to an outcry of protest from many Western countries. 
  The criticism came as something of a surprise to the 
Ministry 
of Public Health, which drafted the legislation, since China had 
practised eugenics for the past five years and the new law was 
designed simply to codify existing practices. However, the 
State Family Planning Commission, which had borne mainly 
American criticism of China's one child policy and was more 
aware of how the legislation would be received abroad, quickly 
voiced its concern over the proposed law, particularly its use 
of language such as "inferior births". 
  A source at the commission said the draft law was seen by 
many within the Government as "very contentious" and possibly 
damaging to China's international reputation. There was also 
concern that it would place additional burdens on the work of 
the commission without providing any extra resources, the source 
said. All government agencies concerned with the proposed law 
are now refusing to discuss the legislation publicly for fear of 
creating more controversy, but it is understood the draft is 
being reworked into a less contentious form. 
  Sources said that while the basic aim of the law, to slow 
the 
rapid increase in the number of children born with disabilities, 
remained the same, the language used would be altered and the 
proposed regulations watered down so as to appear less 
Draconian. The word "eugenics" would not appear anywhere in the 
new draft, a source said. 
  The new draft would make it clear that no one would be 
forced 
to have an abortion or be sterilised and that the emphasis would 
he placed on improving medical and social welfare care. "The 
new draft will focus on the positive aspects of the programme 
rather than those negative, prohibitive aspects," the source 
added. 
  The law is now unlikely to go before the full session of the 
NPC which meets in Beijing on March 10. The legislation is 
still considered too controversial to be discussed at the NPC 
which attracts national and international media attention. He 
pointed out that the last time a controversial law was discussed 
at the NPC namely the three Gorges Dam project, the voting 
session ended in chaos with a deputy from Taiwan storming out. 
It was more likely that the Government would wait for a smaller 
standing committee meeting of the NPC before putting the 
legislation to the vote, he said.

<F P=106> [By Chao Ming (6392 2494): "Secret `106 Work Office'"] </F>
  [Text] What does the figure "106" represent? 
  Regarding the CPC top echelon, this popular figure 
represents 
a "state secret" unknown to the man in the street. 
  For a long time, the CPC has been fond of using number codes 
to name some sensitive departments. The full name of this "106" 
is the "106 Work Office," which was founded on 6 October to 
specialize in collecting, studying and analyzing the conditions 
of personages from political, military economic and monetary 
circles of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, report to the State 
Council and the Central Military Commission, and set out 
specific strategies, principles, and policies toward Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, and Macao. 
<H5>  Branches Will Be Set Up in 16 Cities </H5>
  At a time when Hong Kong and Macao are to be returned to 
China soon, and Taiwan's political situation is in turbulence, 
it is unusual for the CPC to have founded the "106 Work Office." 
The "106 Work Office" is ready to expand in a big way in the 
near future. When it was first founded, the office was set 
inside the People's Liberation Army Headquarters of the General 
Staff Political Department in west suburban Beijing, and moved 
to the Jingxi Guest House in early December; however, the actual 
place for its work were at some barracks under Guangdong 
Military Region in Conghua and the Shanghai Garrison Command in 
west suburban Shanghai. Besides, branches or teams were set up 
in late November last year in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Haikou, 
Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shantou, Zhuhai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Wuhan, 
Lianyungang, Qingdao, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Dalian, and Shenzhen; 
these offices were all set up at local military or garrison 
commands. 
  But nobody should believe that the "106 Work Office" was 
conducting mysterious "underground activities," for it has 
already conducted open and above board activities. It was 
learned that the "106 Work Office" was operating under the names 
of the Office for Taiwan Affairs, the ARATS Office, the office 
of research, the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, or the 
State Council General Office in work concerning external affairs. 
<H5>  "106 Work Office" Is To Focus Its Efforts on Taiwan </H5>
  Because of the considerably important role of the "106 Work 
Office," the CPC top-echelon paid great attention to it as soon 
as it was established, equiped with the most efficient 
personnel. On 7 December last year, the State Council, the 
Central Committee,and the Central Military Commission called a 
meeting at Beijing's Jingxi Guest House, and ceremoniously 
announced that the "106 Work Office" had began work in a 
comprehensive way; Li Peng and Liu Huaqing attended the meeting 
and delivered speeches. 
  Liu Huaqing's speech was noteworthy, in that he acknowledged 
that the "106 Work Office" would devote its energy and efforts 
to Taiwan affairs, and was a work department which would offer 
suggestions to the top echelon of the central authorities in 
resolving the Taiwan issue; thus it must consist of the cream 
from the party, government, and military departments. 
  Liu Huaqing indicated that the core and most arduous job 
today is Taiwan; that being the case, the "106" must focus most 
of its energy on doing work concerning Taiwan. 
  Liu Huaqing stressed that the "106 Work Office" was not a 
provisional work organization, but would probably exist for 10 
or 15 years and even longer; but perhaps it would not last 10 
years, or 5 years; in a nutshell, it would all depend on the 
development of the situation and changes in Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
<H3>  Personnel Are the "Cream of Party, Government and Military 
Departments" </H3>
  Viewing the personnel of the "106 Work Office," they are 
really up to Liu Huaqing's requirement in his speech, namely the 
"cream from the party, government, and military departments": 
  Its director is Zou Jiahua, and deputy directors are Ding 
Wenchang, Tao Siju, and Jia Chunwang. 
  The office is comprised of five groups: liaison, research, 
intelligence, coordination, and economic groups. 
  The major personnel were all selected from the General Staff 
Headquarters, the Ministry of Defense, the University of Science 
and Technology for National Defense, the Office for Affairs of 
Taiwan Affairs, the Office for Affairs of Hong Kong and Macao, 
the Department of United Front Work, the Ministry of State 
Security, the Central Committee policy research center, the 
Guangzhou Military Region, the Nanjing Military Region, and the 
Air Force, with 70-some basic members, who were all cadres at 
and above department level. 
  Besides, the CPC gave the green light to the financial needs 
of "106 Work Office." A source from the State Council said that 
Li Peng and Zhu Rongji approved a first allotment of 280 million 
yuan to the "106 work office" for its preparations.

Cheng-jung (6753 2052 2837): Fujian Checks Tendency of 
Smuggling Out Illegal Emigrants"] 
  [Text] Fuzhou, 18 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--In the latter half of 
last year, due to the infiltration of international human 
smuggling rings, activities of smuggling out illegal emigrants 
were rampant along the coastal areas of Fuzhou. In order to reap 
huge profits, "snakeheads" [leaders of the smuggling gangs] were 
careless of the lives of the illegal emigrants and 
consequently, eight illegal migrants died in a "strange land" 
when the freighter Golden Venture ran aground on the U.S. East 
Coast. The central authorities and the provincial and city 
governments were shocked by this incident and it was not until 
then that the special anti-illegal emigration operation, which 
had been secretly launched for a long time, was made public. A 
few days ago, this reporter visited Fuzhou City, one of the 
areas where smuggling activities of illegal emigrants are most 
severe and learned that the operation had achieved remarkable 
results in the past six months. 
  According to statistics, the authorities cracked 53 cases of 
smuggling out illegal emigrants, seized 932 people, and ferreted 
out 205 "snakeheads" who organized and plotted activities of 
smuggling out illegal emigrants inside and outside the 
territory. Of these, 127 "snakeheads" were arrested and brought 
to justice. Meanwhile, 163 criminals organizing smuggling 
activities and conveying illegal emigrants were seized and 14 
smuggling ships were confiscated. Officials of Fuzhou City said 
that activities of smuggling out illegal emigrants have 
basically stopped. 
<H5>  All-Out Interception and Key Spots on Guard </H5>
  It was learned that measures taken by Fuzhou City in its 
special operation of fighting against illegal emigration were 
mainly as follows: "Spreading propaganda among the masses, 
educating them, and fighting against major cases," "calling on 
the masses to inform against smuggling cases and assigning 
public security personnel to investigate and punish those 
cases," "pursuing smugglers at sea and intercepting them on 
land," and "guarding key spots and imposing full control." 
Apart from integrating these measures into a single whole, 
decisions concerning the number of personnel, time, tasks, and 
responsibilities were all fixed and implemented at every level. 
Likewise, precautionary measures were taken at every level. 
  Border defense and public security personnel being on guard 
at ports strengthened shipping administration at ports, bays, 
and ferries; supervised fixed spots, ships, posts, and locations 
at 396 ports and bays; and ordered various types of 17,672 ships 
to register with the authorities again and receive new codes and 
permits. Meanwhile, since it had become a characteristic that 
most illegal emigrants did not board smuggling ships at 
localities in which their permanent residences were registered, 
the authorities imposed greater control over inns and hotels in 
various localities. Stations were set up in public places and 
localities with a large number of floating population for 
nonnative people to report to and the authorities attached 
importance to the work of ferreting out suspects involved in 
activities of smuggling out illegal emigrants. 
  Contingent forces were specially organized to deal with 
emergent cases of smuggling illegal emigrants. 
<H5>  Line of Defense Against Illegal Emigration Set on the Sea </H5>
  Departments of border defense and public security redeployed 
forces for patrol and inspection at sea and transferred 12 ships 
and boats to strengthen patrols at sea. A line of defense 
against illegal emigration was established on the maritime space 
from Luoyuan Wan in the north to Pingyun in the south. 
  In key villages along the coast, concerned departments 
strengthened education and imposed stricter control on three 
kinds of people, that is: People within the key age groups for 
illegal emigration, people with past records of illegal 
emigration, and people suspected of taking part in activities of 
smuggling out illegal emigrants. Moreover, rules and 
regulations were set up in every native village which was 
considered a unit, to implement the village-cadre contract 
responsibility system, to intensify the registration of foreign 
population, and to vigorously plug the loopholes which key 
target groups of people were beyond control. 
<H5>  Severe Punishment of a Number of "Snakeheads" </H5>
  Moreover, people organizing illegal emigration and conveying 
illegal emigrants were severely punished by judicial departments 
in Fuzhou City in accordance with the law. On 15 July 1993, the 
first rally to pronounce judgments on criminals since the start 
of the anti-illegal emigration struggle was held by Fuzhou City 
Intermediate Court in Fuzhou City Workers' Cultural Palace. On 
the basis of the law, the court sentenced 32 criminals smuggling 
illegal emigrants to one to five years' imprisonment, announced 
the arrests of 15 other criminals for smuggling illegal 
emigrants, and sent 44 illegal emigrants to 
reeducation-through-labor camps. Among them, Chen Xingnuan and 
Wu Baohua--two criminals from Changle County--introduced a total 
of 17 persons to a "snakehead" called Zhang to join him in 
smuggling activities organized by him. On 5 January 1993, 17 
illegal emigrants organized by Chen and Wu boarded a ship in 
Taishan, Guangdong, to emigrate to the United States, but they 
were later repatriated to China. The two criminals--Chen and 
Wu--violated state laws and regulations on immigration and 
emigration constituting the crime of organizing others to slip 
out of the country. Consequently, Chen Xingnuan was sentenced 
to five years' imprisonment and fined 30,000 yuan; whereas Wu 
Baohua was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined 
10,000 yuan. It is learned that over the past six months, 
political and legal organs at all levels throughout the city 
have punished a total of 208 criminals organizing and plotting 
activities of illegal emigration and conveying illegal 
emigrants. Of these, 15 were imprisoned, 18 were sent to 
reeducation-through-labor camps, 100 were detained and tried, 33 
were fined, and seven were under house arrest. In addition, 
permission was sought from public security organs at higher 
levels to ask Interpol to help pursue six plotters in large 
foreign smuggling rings who were at large. Meanwhile, strict 
precautions were taken to deal with the new situation of illegal 
emigration from other places which started to emerge not long 
ago. Over the past four months, 10 such cases of illegal 
emigration to the United States and Japan have been cracked and 
a total of 422 people arrested. Moreover, 11 cases of illegal 
emigration in which Taiwanese freighters were directly involved 
have been cracked. 
<H5>  U.S. Police Agree To Cooperate With Fuzhou City Government </H5>
  Apart from taking stronger action to fight and guard against 
smuggling activities, the government of Fuzhou City also 
succeeded in enlisting the cooperation of U.S. police. On 26 
October 1993, during their visit to the United States, Fang 
Qingyun, vice president of Fuzhou City's Association for 
Friendship with Foreign Countries, and Wang Yingquan, vice 
chairman of Fuzhou City People's Congress Standing Committee, 
made a special trip to call on Holliday, deputy chief of New 
York City Police Headquarters. They briefed Holliday on the 
situation and causes of illegal immigration into the United 
States by a small number of people from coastal areas in Fuzhou 
as well as on measures taken by Fuzhou City People's Government 
to stop illegal emigration. They also asked the U.S. side for 
future cooperation to stop illegal migration. The New York City 
Police expressed their understanding and appreciation in this 
respect and agreed to cooperate with the Chinese side by taking 
joint measures to stop illegal migration. 
<H5>  Two Township and Town Officials Dismissed </H5>
  Another work meeting on fighting against illegal emigration 
was held in Fuzhou City at the beginning of the new year. At 
the meeting, Xi Jinping, member of the Fujian Provincial CPC 
Committee Standing Committee and secretary of the Fuzhou City 
CPC Committee, again urged governments at all levels not to 
lower their guard on the issue of illegal emigration. He 
stressed that for those officials who were so slack in the work 
of fighting against illegal emigration that grave consequences 
followed, it was necessary to resolutely investigate and affix 
their responsibilities, including transferring them to other 
posts or dismissing them. It was learned that two township and 
town officials had been dismissed because they did not exert 
themselves in fighting against illegal emigration and that 
Fuzhou City would pass sentences on and punish a number of 
people organizing smuggling activities and conveying illegal 
emigrants.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lai Chin-hung (6351 6930 1347) from Taipei] </F>
  [Text] The mainland State Council transmitted some days 
ago a document worked out by the State Planning Commission. 
According to the document, no construction of new horse racing 
and golf courses is allowed in the future. All provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions are expected to strictly 
follow the "four no's principles": No horse racing and golf 
courses established as listed projects; no permission granted to 
such projects; no land provided; and no loans given. 
  An informed source in Beijing said: The State Council 
transmitted the document to various provinces, municipalities, 
and autonomous regions across the country in mid-January, 
requiring them not to grant permission to construction of new 
horse racing and golf courses as of the day the document was 
received. In the meantime, the Construction Ministry, the State 
Land Administration Bureau, the PRC State Administration for 
Industry and Commerce, and the State General Administration of 
Taxation jointly issued a circular stressing that no licenses, 
land, and loans shall be given to projects involving a high rate 
of consumption, including horse racing and golf courses. This 
is another specific administrative measure against the building 
of new golf courses since the national conference for land 
bureau directors held last October. 
  It is reported that central authorities had earlier made it 
a 
rule that apart form a few major cities like Beijing and 
Shanghai, where golf courses have been built, only one golf 
course shall be built in each province and municipality. 
However, many provinces ignored the order and pressed ahead 
with the construction of golf courses under the pretext that a 
good recreational environment is necessary for attracting 
foreign funds. Take Hainan for example, the provincial 
government gave formal approval to 15 golf courses last year and 
more golf courses are in preparation pending permission. 
  The same source said: Many people on the mainland are 
presently interested in "speculating in certificates," believing 
"speculating in real estate is more profitable than speculating 
in stocks; speculating in futures is more profitable than 
speculating in real estate; and speculating in membership cards 
is more profitable than speculating in futures." "Speculating 
in" golf club membership cards serves as a shortcut to getting 
rich. Possessing a golf club membership card is regarded as 
enjoying a higher social status.

  [Text] Boston, Feb. 2 (CNA) -- The people of the Republic 
of China [ROC] on Taiwan believe that they should and must 
assume a more active role in the international community to help 
enhance regional stability and security, ROC Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Chien Fu said Wednesday [2 February]. 
  Chien made the remarks during a one-hour speech to students 
and faculty of the Harvard Business School. He spoke on 
Taiwan's role in Asia-Pacific economic growth. 
  He noted that the Asia-Pacific, which boasts the highest 
economic growth rate in the world, would benefit from the ROC's 
participation in regional development and security programs. 
  He also said that closer regional economic, commercial and 
technological cooperation is key to avoiding political and 
military confrontation. 
  He stressed that as a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum, Taiwan registers firmly its right to 
participate in APEC meetings and activities on an equal basis 
with other members. 
  "We intend to share our valuable developmental experience 
with others by hosting more APEC activities in the future," 
Chien explained. 
  But Chien also said that Taiwan cannot tolerate the 
introduction of political or sovereignty issues in the informal 
consultative forum. 
  Chien said that the ROC is now devoting new emphasis to 
establishing Taiwan as an Asia-Pacific regional operations 
center, where people, capital, goods, and information can move 
in and out freely. 
  In a question and answer session after the speech, Chien 
reaffirmed that the ROC is a sovereign nation. He predicted 
that when per-capita income in Mainland China reaches between 
US$1,000 and US$2,000 by the year 2000, their people will yearn 
for freedom, democracy and human rights. 
  After the speech, Chien and his wife called on the Governor 
of Massachusetts William Weld. They exchanged gifts during a 
cordial half-hour chat. 
  Chien also had lunch with professors of the Harvard Business 
School at noon. 
  Chien will return to Taipei Friday after winding up his 
weeklong visit in the U.S. during which he also made a speech at 
Boston University.

  [Text] Boston, Feb. 2 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
will send agricultural experts to Burkina Faso to help the west 
African country develop its agriculture and economy, Foreign 
Affairs Minister Chien Fu said Wednesday [2 February]. 
  Chien, who is currently on a speaking tour here, made the 
statement shortly after the ROC and Burkina Faso issued a joint 
communique in Taipei on the resumption of full diplomatic 
relations. 
  The ROC first established diplomatic ties with Burkina Faso, 
then known as Upper Volta, in 1961, but suspended such ties in 
1973 after the African nation recognized Beijing. 
  Chien said the ROC stationed an agricultural mission in 
Burkina Faso in the 1960. "Many Burkina Faso people still 
remembered the achievements of our agricultural mission in 
helping raise their rice production," he noted. 
  The ROC and Burkina Faso began discussion of resuming 
diplomatic ties two years ago. The Burkina Faso cabinet 
formally agreed to resume ties with the ROC in January, Chien 
said. 
  With an area of 274,000 square kilometers and a population 
of 
9.5 million, Burkina Faso became an independent nation in 1960 
after decades of French colonial rule. It is rich in mineral 
resources and produces large quantities of cotton and livestock. 
Its political situation is stable, Chien said. 
  Moreover, Chien added, Burkina Faso has great influence on 
other west African nations. "The resumption of diplomatic ties 
with Burkina Faso will facilitate our effort to promote 
exchanges with that part of the world," he noted. 
  The ROC now maintains full diplomatic ties with eight 
African 
nations -- South Africa, Swaziland, Malawi, Liberia, Niger, 
Guinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic and Burkina Faso. 
  It has opened a consulate general in Calabar, Nigeria and 
set 
up representative offices in Madagascar, Zaire and Angola 
bearing the ROC's full national title.

  [Text] Brisbane, Feb. 1 (CNA) -- The President of the 
Republic of China [ROC] parliament Tuesday [1 February] asked 
his Australian counterparts to support Taiwan's bid for 
membership in the United Nations, the Taipei Economic and 
Cultural Office (TECO) in Canberra said. 
  Liu Sung-fan, president of the ROC Legislative Yuan, 
accompanied by Yuan Vice President Wang Ching-ping and 
legislator Pan Wei-kang, is the most senior parliamentary leader 
from Taiwan to visit Australia since Canberra switched its 
recognition to Beijing in 1972, TECO representative Francias Li 
said. 
  Li said Liu met Steven Martin, speaker of the Australian 
House of Representatives, in Canberra. Liu told Martin that 
Taiwan wanted to rejoin the UN because it is the world's 14th 
largest trading nation and its foreign exchange reserves are 
among the world's largest. 
  "Our country wants to play a role in the world community and 
it's unfair that we are barred from the UN," Liu said. 
  Martin said he fully understood Taiwan's stance. 
  Liu and his party also met Senator Steven Loosley, chairman 
of the joint committee of foreign affairs, defense and trade. 
Liu asked Loosley to support Taiwan membership in the 
Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum (APPF), he said in an interview. 
  Loosley and 10 members of parliament of the Australian 
Labour 
Party and the opposition told Liu they support Taiwan's APPF 
membership bid and understand its aspirations to enter the UN, 
Li said. 
  "The visit by President Liu will certainly help cement our 
substantive ties with Australia," Li noted. 
  The delegation will leave for New Zealand on Thursday to 
meet 
their New Zealand counterparts before returning to Taipei on 
February 6.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA) -- Preparations are under way 
for Taiwan to attend a ministerial-level meeting of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Morocco April 15, an 
economics official reported Thursday [3 February]. 
  Tsai Lien-sheng, a section chief of the Board of Foreign 
Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that Taiwan 
has been invited to attend the meeting, in which the 112 GATT 
contracting parties will sign the agreement reached during the 
Uruguay Round talks in mid-December. 
  The GATT meeting will also make a final decision on the 
exact 
time for the establishment of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO), Tsai pointed out. 
  Under the Uruguay Round accord, all GATT signatories are set 
to become members of the WTO, which will be given tougher 
enforcement powers to supersede GATT. 
  GATT members have attached great importance to the Morocco 
meeting, Tsai said, noting the European Union and the United 
States will reportedly send 200-member delegations. 
  Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang is expected to lead 
the 
Taiwan delegation to the meeting, Tsai said. 
  Taiwan, accepted as an observer of the Geneva-based world 
trade regulating body in September 1992, hopes to become a full 
member by the end of this year.

  [Text] Secretary General of the Straits Exchange 
Foundation [SEF] Chiao Jen-ho Wednesday called on Chinese in 
both Taiwan and Mainland China to break away from ideological 
restraints so that intellectuals can bring out their talents and 
wisdom to the foremost. He made the statement in a visit to a

for three rounds of talks with his Mainland Chinese counterpart, 
Secretary General of the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait, Tang Shubei. The two nominally private but 
government-funded organizations are entrusted by Taipei and 
Peking [as heard] to handle bilateral affairs in absence of 
official channels. During the first round on Tuesday afternoon, 
both sides expressed their [words indistinct] respective stances 
which differed vastly. Taipei reiterated that Beijing should 
recognize and respect its judicial jurisdiction and legal 
system. Conversely, Beijing argued that now that the two sides 
are presently in a state of separation, it should not be 
permitted to continue permanently.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 3 (AFP)--Beijing Communist Party 
Secretary Chen Xitong has demanded tighter security measures for 
the Chinese capital, warning of the threat of unrest, the 
Beijing Daily reported Thursday. "The most important duty of 
all Beijing authorities this year is to protect political and 
social stability," said Chen, an arch-conservative who was one 
of the chiefs behind the bloody crackdown on the 1989 
pro-democracy movement at Tiananmen Square. 
  Chen, who is also a member of the politburo, made the 
comments Wednesday after a municipal meeting, flanked by Mayor 
Li Qiyan, the report said. "Our task will be harder this year," 
he said. "We must work hard to create a stable environment to 
enable the success of the economic reforms." 
  Chen said that public order in Beijing was "generally good" 
but there were still "weak points." It was necessary to 
"strengthen security networks based on the masses," he said, in 
an oblique reference to neighbourhood committees, which play a 
major role in surveillance. 
  Chen's remarks add to a a series of statements by Chinese 
leaders pointing to fears at the highest level of an outbreak of 
social unrest this year. Major economic reforms are set to be 
implemented in the coming months, probably adding to 
unemployment and inflation, analysts say. Officials have also 
expressed concern at the huge number of migrant workers arriving 
in Beijing and other major cities. 
  In an apparent reflection of official unease, Beijing police 
recently stepped up their presence, launching round-the-clock 
patrols.

  [Text] At the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Guizhou 
Provincial People's Congress, provincial Governor Chen Shineng 
delivered a government work report in which he expounded on the 
provincial government work in 1994, stating: The year 1994 is 
at once an important year in which we will strive to maintain a 
sustained and rapid economic growth and a crucial year in which 
we will strive to rapidly build a socialist market economy. 
  Governor Chen Shineng maintained: In 1994, we will 
concentrate on fulfilling the following five major tasks: 
  1. To profoundly implement the spirit of the 14th CPC 
National Congress as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; 
  2. To comprehensively accomplish tasks set out at the 
Seventh Guizhou Provincial CPC Congress; 
  3. To rapidly build a socialist market economy by vigorously 
deepening reform, expanding opening up to the outside world, 
furthering structural readjustment, improving management, and 
increasing efficiency, and building a diligent and clean 
government; 
  4. To raise the province's total gross national product by 
8-9 percent, primary industrial output value by 2.2-3.2 percent, 
total agricultural output value by 3-4 percent, secondary 
industrial output value by 9.5-10.8 percent, total industrial 
output value by 12.5-13.5 percent, tertiary industrial output 
value by 14-15 percent, and local revenue through existing 
channels by 9.1 percent over last year; 
  5. To energetically develop all types of social 
undertakings. 
  Governor Chen Shineng noted: We are bound to confront 
numerous favorable conditions but a host of difficulties as well 
in accomplishing the above mentioned tasks. First and foremost, 
reform aimed at instituting a diversified revenue system will 
place a significant strain on the province's revenue growth. 
After instituting a unified income tax system, enterprises are 
bound to come across more challenges in respect to market 
competition and find it more difficult to control price hikes 
and raise funds due to a series of restrictions caused by 
"bottlenecks" and more painstaking to effect structural 
readjustment. In view of this situation, Chen Shineng stressed 
that enterprises should take the initiative to improve all sorts 
of work and adapt themselves to a new economic environment. 
Besides, governments at all levels in Guizhou should also make 
intensive efforts to emancipate minds, seek truth from facts, 
deepen reform, expand opening up to the outside world, boost 
morale, carry out practical work in a down-to-earth manner, 
secure sustained economic growth, tackle contradictions, and 
safeguard political and social stability. 
  Governor Chen Shineng held: In 1994, in accordance with "The 
CPC Central Committee Decision on Several Questions on Building 
a Socialist Market Economic Structure," we must make redoubled 
efforts to expedite the pace of reform by making clear-cut 
emphases and proceeding in a planned way. We should make 
vigorous efforts to intensify reform in the following six areas: 
  1. To conscientiously organize and effect financial, 
revenue, banking, investment, planning, and foreign trade 
systems reforms; 
  2. To speed up property rights system reform with an eye to 
gradually establishing a modern enterprise system; 
  3. To foster and develop a market system and continually 
push ahead with circulation structural reform; 
  4. To further deepen rural reform and establish and perfect 
a socialized rural service system; 
  5. To deepen distribution system reform and rapidly build a 
social security system; 
  6. To make a success of personnel system reform and 
practically transform government functions.

  [Text] According to a FUJIAN RIBAO report, as the Spring 
Festival approached, Jia Qinglin, provincial party secretary and 
governor; Huang Wenlin, secretary general of the provincial 
party committee standing committee; and Zheng Yizheng, chief 
procurator of the provincial procuratorate, together with 
leaders of the relevant departments directly under the 
provincial authorities, went to Ningde Prefecture to visit 
cadres and masses from 26 to 28 January. 
  Yesterday morning, Jiang Qinglin expressed important views 
on 
the current work. He said: Ningde Prefecture has scaled new 
heights in economic development this year and made breakthrough 
progress in all aspects of work. This is the result of the 
efforts of the prefecture's people under the leadership of the 
prefectural party committee. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, 
he expressed his thanks, regards, and Lunar New Year greetings 
to the cadres and masses in the entire prefecture. 
  Jia Qinglin stressed the need to do more in this year's 
reform, development, and stability. On development, he pointed 
out: First, efforts for agricultural and rural work should not 
be relaxed and rural work should be focused on increasing the 
peasants' income. It is necessary to develop a high-yield, 
high-quality, and highly efficient agriculture, to optimize the 
agricultural structure, and to develop township and town 
enterprises. Second, there is a need to resolve the problems of 
funding and employment, to raise funds through various channels, 
and to encourage the private and individual economic sectors to 
develop further. Third, we should pay attention to economic 
results. The manifestation of better economic results is an 
increase in revenue. Fourth, we should bring the energy 
industry and transportation into prominence, firmly carry out 
the policy of five wheels rolling forward together in developing 
the energy industry, and wage a large-scale people's war in 
communications construction. Fifth, we should abide by the 
principle of seeking truth from facts and arrange economic 
development in light of our specific conditions. 
  On reform, Jia Qinglin requested all levels of party 
committees and governments to carefully organize the 
implementation of all reform measures, to subordinate local 
interests to overall interests, to create a relaxed environment 
for reform, and to promote development by means of reform, so as 
to gain the people's understanding and support. 
  On stability, Jia Qinglin pointed out the need to strengthen 
the unity of cadres and departments, to form great unity and a 
great alliance, to remove factors causing instability and 
disunity, to maintain the stability of the cadre contingent, and 
to preserve social stability. 
  Subsequently Jia Qinglin stressed the need to carry out two 
types of work simultaneously and lay equal stress on them, and 
to resolutely carry out party building, ideological and 
political work, and anticorruption work. 
  In conclusion, Jia Qinglin demanded that a good job be done 
for Spring Festival activities. Help should be offered to the 
masses so that they can resolve their actual problems. 
Localities should do something practical for Armed Forces 
units. In the meantime, leading cadres at all levels should 
subject themselves to an anticorruption test during the Spring 
Festival.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhou Jingyu (0719 2529 3157): "Xi </F>
Jinping Talks on Plans for Infrastructural Construction"] 
  [Text] Fuzhou, 30 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- On the eve 
of the lunar new year, Xi Jinping, member of the standing 
committee of the Fujian Provincial CPC Committee and secretary 
of the Fuzhou City CPC Committee, told this reporter about plans 
for Fuzhou's infrastructural construction. 
  Fuzhou will work mostly at the construction of Changle 
International Airport, the enlargement of the Min Jiang Bridge, 
the construction of the second beltway, sewage and garbage 
disposal, the expansion of the capacity of program-controlled 
telephones, and so forth. In developing this projects, the 
proportion of foreign capital utilized will increase 
considerably. Fuzhou's investment in infrastructural 
construction last year totaled 5.8 billion yuan, the largest in 
history, and this year's infrastructural investment will exceed 
that of last year. 
  Xi Jinping said: The construction of Changle International 
Airport, a Sino-foreign joint project, is the biggest project 
for the year. It will entail a total investment of 2.3 billion 
yuan. American and Spanish banks, as well as British, Singapore, 
and Malaysian consortia, are showing very great interest in it 
and are negotiating with us. The removal of the 1,800 mu of 
land all has been finished and the airport runway project will 
begin in April. Its passenger terminal now is being designed by 
famous Singapore experts, and our requirements are that the 
airport should have ethnic and local characteristics, and that 
it must attain top international standards. 
  To match the airport project, a special 18-km expressway 
will 
be built from Fuzhou to Changle International Airport, and the 
Qingzhou Bridge straddling the Min Jiang will be constructed. 
Their total investment comes to 1.7 billion yuan. The projects 
are being prepared vigorously and foreign capital will be 
utilized. 
  Last year, Fuzhou built the 4,400-meter third Min Jiang 
Bridge and the 2,600-meter Wuliting Overpass, which have greatly 
alleviated traffic moving into and out of Fuzhou. This year, 
the Min Jiang Bridge (the second Min Jiang bridge) project will 
be carried out through the expansion of the bridge surface by 
seven meters. The bridge will be closed for the project and 
will be finished this year. Xi Jinping said: We are building 
the bridge with bank loans and will repay the debt with the 
bridge tolls and income from its neighboring sections. We will 
continue to build the fourth bridge over the Min Jiang in the 
future. 
  Fuzhou will complete the main part of the second beltway, 
which stretches a dozen kilometers or more. Moreover, it will 
repair and construct several main passages in the city, 
including Guloujintai, Cangshanguanhai, Yangqiao West, and 
Guohuo Roads. These projects will entail an investment of 200 
million yuan. 
  Furthermore, Fuzhou will step up electricity development 
this 
year. Xi Jinping said they are "very determined" about this 
because power shortages are detrimental to Fuzhou's development 
and to attracting capital. This year, Fuzhou first will 
complete 100,000-kw of the large, 180,000-kilowatt power plant 
in Fuqing. Moreover, the Changle power plant will generate an 
additional 50,000 kw by the end of this year. In this way, 
power shortages in Fuzhou can be alleviated. 
  Fuzhou's program-controlled telephones will have seven 
digits 
from March onward. This year, the city will have another 50,000 
citywide phone call sets and 20,000 international telephone call 
sets, and will complete the main post and telecommunications 
building so as to ensure that Fuzhou leads in telecommunications. 
  Xi Jinping also specifically stressed environmental 
protection. He said that Fuzhou will actively seek loans from 
foreign governments, the Asian Development Bank, and the World 
Bank to strengthen environmental protection and development, and 
that the city will spend 100 million yuan building a 
50,000-tonne sewage disposal plant and will construct a huge 
garbage site in Hongmiaoling. Xi said that is a "100-year plan." 
  This series of important infrastructural projects will 
enable 
Fuzhou to eliminate traffic problems and power shortages, and to 
prepare for a new takeoff. Xi Jinping said, with a very 
resolute tone and full of confidence: "We have many 
difficulties regarding capital and the projects, but we will 
forge ahead in the face of the difficulties and do our work in 
earnest, and we absolutely will not sit and theorize, and thus 
lose the opportunity!"

  [Text] On the morning of 1 February when the Spring 
Festival will soon arrive at the provincial veteran cadres club 
in Jinan, the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government held a tea party attended by provincial-level veteran 
cadres to welcome the arrival of the Spring Festival. 
  Provincial leaders and more than 200 veteran comrades and 
liaison men in charge of the work toward veteran cadres happily 
gathered together to jointly celebrate the Spring Festival. 
  Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of the provincial government, chaired the 
tea party. On behalf of the provincial party committee and the 
provincial government, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, first offered, at an earlier date, 
the Spring Festival greetings to the veteran comrades and the 
liaison men in charge of the work toward veteran cadres who were 
present at the tea party, the veteran comrades retired from 
various fronts in the province, and their families and 
relatives; and also extended cordial greetings and sincere 
respects to them. 
  He said: In the past year, the province ensured the 
political and social stability, the economy of the province was 
developed, and all provincial undertakings were flourishing. A 
good situation characterized by vitality and progress has 
emerged. New headway has been made in improving party style, 
administrative honesty, spiritual civilization, democracy, and 
legal system and developing various social undertakings. Such a 
good political and economic situation results from the diligent 
and arduous labor made in a unified manner by the broad masses 
of party members, cadres, and people across the province. This 
cannot be separated from the warm concern and enthusiastic 
support of all veteran comrades and all seniors. The practice 
has fully proved that the vast number of retired cadres are the 
precious wealth of the party as well as a key force to promote 
reform and construction and stabilize the society. The party 
committees and governments at various levels should be concerned 
with, respect, and cherish the veteran comrades and enable them 
to bring their key roles in the building of the two 
civilizations. 
  He urged: On the premise of taking care of their health, the 
veteran comrades will continue to be concerned with and support 
the work of the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government, do some work according to their ability, and make 
new contributions to consolidating and developing the province's 
gratifying situation. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The year 1994 is a key year to 
promote the package reform and build the socialist market 
economic operation mechanism as well as the first year to 
realize the second-step strategic target. At the time of 
deepening reform, expanding the scale of opening up, and 
ensuring a sustained, fast, and healthy progress of the economy, 
we should continue to attend to party building, the improvement 
of party style and administrative honesty, the setup of 
democracy and legal system, and the improvement of spiritual 
civilization. The tasks are glorious and arduous. Now, we are 
confronted with not only favorable opportunities for development 
but also many difficulties and problems. Both favorable 
opportunities and challenges coexist. Under the new situation, 
we should be prudent and modest and guard against arrogance and 
rashness; persistently use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm our 
brains; grasp favorable opportunities to deepen reform, promote 
development, and maintain stability; and creatively carry out 
our work with new ideas, new pose, and new work style. Under 
the leadership of the party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin 
as its nucleus, we should deeply implement the guidelines of the 
14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th 
party Central Committee, persist in the principle of taking a 
two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough, 
emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, be united to keep 
forging ahead, do solid work, and further capture a bigger 
success in building socialist spiritual and material 
civilizations. 
  Present at the tea party were some other leading comrades of 
the province, including Li Chunting, Li Wenquan, Han Xikai, Li 
Zhen, and Lu Maozeng; some veteran comrades, including Pan 
Qilong, Su Yiran, Liang Buting, Zhao Ding, Gao Keting, Qin 
Hezhen, and Li Zichao; some retired cadres at the deputy 
provincial chief level; and families of the late cadres at the 
provincial chief and deputy provincial chief levels.

  [Text] Shanghai, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Several stores in 
Shanghai, China's largest metropolis, have adopted installment 
payment plans, a breakthrough in the city's commercial industry. 
  So far, some 100 citizens have made purchases under the new 
credit system, buying color televisions, air conditioners and 
refrigerators. After paying one-sixth of a product's purchase 
price, customers should pay off the balance owed within a year. 
  The service is staged by Shanghai Yintong Trust Ltd., 
jointly 
funded by the Shanghai Investment and Trust Corporation and 
other local and Hong Kong partners. 
  It is stipulated that customers with monthly incomes above 
600 yuan can apply for the installment plan. They may begin to 
buy goods on credit after passing a Yintong Ltd. capital and 
credit assessment. 
  Shanghai First department store, which experimented with 
installment sales last November, has offered consultancy to more 
than 2,000 interested customers. 
  Many consumers think that the plan can help them make 
reasonable family economic arrangements and relieve their 
worries over price hikes. 
  This month, three other shops in the city have also adopted 
the measure.

  [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has become 
China's largest gold ornament market, according to "CHINA 
BUSINESS NEWS". 
  A survey shows that sales of such ornaments in the city last 
year were 20 tons, an increase of five tons over the previous 
year and double the 1991 figure. 
  Shanghai people's average possession of gold ornaments rose 
from 0.77 grams per capita in 1991 to 1.54 grams last year. 
  Trading in gold ornaments resumed in China in 1982. 
  The newspaper attributed the fast growth to the rise of 
Shanghai residents' income, the custom of purchasing gold 
ornaments, and the change of habits from keeping gold for its 
value to acquiring it both for its value and its decoration. 
  With approval of the People's Bank, Shanghai set up 300 gold 
retail shops toward the end of last year and some 150 shops are 
waiting for official approval. 
  There were only 40 such shops in the city a decade ago.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The methodology 
invented by the late American professor George Gallup to 
discover what's on the minds of the public is now helping local 
government officials to govern better. 
  Public attitudes ranging from commodity prices and the image 
of public servants to environmental pollution and housing reform 
are what a small research agency in south China's boomtown of 
Guangzhou has been finding out since 1990. 
  Once or twice every month, local media devote time and space 
to publish the findings on matters of social focus. 
  The feedback prompts the municipal government to adopt 
measures to solve the problems that affect the life of local 
residents. 
  Last year a survey found that 70 percent of Guangzhou people 
are dissatisfied with the jammed traffic conditions. The 
relevant departments took immediate action to ban bicycle 
traffic on 11 major roads. 
  A follow-up telephone survey, however, revealed that 55 
percent of the people were against the new policy. Then the 
city solicited ideas from the public and came up with a plan 
that worked. 
  Xu Yucong, an employee at the Guangzhou public opinion 
research center, which conducted these surveys, said that the 
center aims to reflect the concerns of people and serves to jog 
the minds of policy makers. "In this way, we can draw more 
attention from the leaders whose policies can help harmonize the 
multi-faceted relationships in society." 
  To date, the center has conducted over 60 surveys, involving 
more than 1.4 million residents. 
  Xu said some of the findings touched on sensitive issues. 
But the municipal government backed their endeavors and 
considered the practice a main channel of communication of the 
Communist Party and government organizations with the general 
public. 
  Xu said the center is able to keep itself objective and 
unbiased by maintaining total financial independence. 
  Although the Gallup methods have not spread to other parts 
of 
the country in finding out public opinion, major cities such as 
Shanghai, Tianjin and the capital Beijing do have "mayor's hot 
lines" that citizens can dial at any time to voice their 
grievances and proposals.

  [Text] Shenzhen, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Shenzhen, one of 
the earliest special economic zones in south China's Guangdong 
Province, will take measures to speed up the 
internationalization of its banking industry, according to a 
municipal banking working conference held here today. 
  The measures include: 
  -- More overseas financial organizations will be allowed to 
set up branches in Shenzhen and foreign investment in such 
sectors as banks, trust, foundations, securities and insurance 
companies will be encouraged. 
  -- The business scope of foreign-funded financial 
organizations will be admitted into such areas as savings, loans 
and accounting in RMB [renminbi], the Chinese currency. 
  -- Locally-funded financial organizations are encouraged to 
set up branches overseas and transnational banks. 
  At present, there are 41 foreign-funded financial 
organizations in Shenzhen, including banks, securities companies 
and insurance companies. Over the past decade or so, they have 
introduced more than one billion U.S. dollars of foreign funds 
into Shenzhen. 
  Shenzhen plans to increase its savings by 18 billion yuan 
this year, an increase of 36 percent over last year, according 
to today's conference. 
  In 1993, the banking industry of Shenzhen maintained healthy 
momentum. At the end of last year, it reported a savings 
balance of 65.7 billion yuan, an increase of 10.2 billion yuan 
over the beginning of 1993, up 18.4 percent; a loan balance of 
50.2 billion yuan, an increase of 12.6 billion yuan and up 33.6 
percent; and a foreign currency loan balance of 3.66 billion 
U.S. dollars, an increase of 800 million U.S. dollars and up 
16.1 percent.

  [Text] Departments of foreign economic relations and trade 
throughout the province have done their best to maximize foreign 
exchange earnings from exports, and they have made marked 
achievements in foreign trade. Last year these departments 
achieved a total import-export volume of $2.34 billion, an 
increase of 16 percent over the previous year; of this amount, 
$1.61 billion was obtained from exports. 
  At a provincial foreign economic relations and trade work 
meeting on 27 January, provincial party and government leaders 
Chen Bangzhu, Liu Fusheng, Wang Keying, Tang Zhixiang, and He 
Shaoqing fully confirmed their achievements. 
  Earlier this year, the province was facing unprecedented 
difficulties in foreign economic relations and trade. The 
provincial foreign economic relations and trade commission 
pointed out the need to maximize export earnings. As a result, 
the province freed itself from this predicament. By the end of 
last year, 37 of the 41 foreign trade enterprises and companies 
directly under the provincial authorities had carried out the 
provincial task, and 36 of the 55 enterprises and scientific 
research institutions with export operational rights increased 
their foreign exchange earnings. 
  On foreign economic relations, last year the province 
approved the establishment of 1,360 new three-capital 
enterprises. The foreign capital actually used by three-capital 
enterprises totaled $1.03 billion and their foreign exchange 
earnings topped $100 million. 
  After listening to this feedback report, Governor Chen 
Bangzhu made an important speech on this year's foreign economic 
relations and trade. He pointed out: The key to expanding 
foreign exchange earnings and improving economic results is to 
adjust and optimize the mix of export commodities and to improve 
their quality. We should strengthen our investment guidance, 
pay close attention to the management of three-capital 
enterprises, and further improve our investment environment.

<F P=106> [Speech by Sun Weiben, secretary of provincial party </F>
committee, at a provincial rally to mark Mao Zedong's centenary: 
"Advance Courageously Along the Socialist Road With Chinese 
Characteristics"] 
  [Text] Comrades: 
  Tomorrow we will mark the centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong. 
We 
hold this ceremonious rally here with a feeling of respect to 
cherish the memory of Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong was 
a great Marxist and the principal founder and leader of the 
Chinese People's Liberation Army and the PRC. In remembering 
Comrade Mao Zedong, we should not only express our feeling of 
observance of and respect for Comrade Mao Zedong, but more 
importantly, we should uphold and develop Mao Zedong's thought 
under the new historical conditions, guide our various fields of 
work with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, and realize the unfulfilled wish 
of Comrade Mao Zedong on building a socialist, modernized, and 
strong country. 
  Over half a century before and after Comrade Mao Zedong's 
birth were the years during which the Chinese people conducted 
repeated trials of strength and acute struggle with strong 
imperialist elements of foreign countries and feudalist elements 
at home. A great era will inevitably create outstanding figures 
and outstanding figures will, in turn, promote the advance of 
history. Comrade Mao Zedong was a great and outstanding figure 
who emerged in our country during the great changes of history 
of over a century. During the most difficult time of the Chinese 
revolution, he was the first one to find a correct road for the 
revolution. Many times he saved the party and the country from 
crises, and enabled China's revolution to succeed after facing 
many difficulties. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, 
the Chinese Communist people finally overturned the "three big 
mountains" after conducting heroic, indomitable, and successive 
struggles; ended the Chinese nation's history of humiliation of 
allowing themselves to be trampled upon for over a century; and 
stood up firmly in the eastern part of the world. After the 
victory of the new democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong 
also led the Chinese people of various nationalities to win a 
great victory in socialist transformation through great efforts 
and struggles, and turned a new page of the socialist revolution 
and construction. Just as it was pointed out in the decision of 
the sixth plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee: 
Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian 
revolutionary, strategist, and theoretician. Reviewing his 
entire life, although he committed serious mistakes during the 
"Great Cultural Revolution," his contributions ranked first 
among all. He made indelible contributions to our party and the 
Chinese People's Liberation Army, to the victory of the 
liberation cause of the Chinese people of various nationalities, 
to the founding of the PRC and to the development of our 
country's socialist cause. He made great contributions to 
liberating the world's oppressed nation and to the cause of 
human progress. History and the people will always remember the 
great historical contributions of Mao Zedong. 
  At the time when we commemorate the centenary of Comrade Mao 
Zedong, the people of Heilongjiang will never forget the time 
when Comrade Mao Zedong inspected our province after he visited 
the Soviet Union. During his inspection tour, Comrade Mao 
Zedong went to plants and workshops to hold cordial talks with 
the broad masses of cadres and the people, proposed the 
historical task of transforming the consumption city of Harbin 
into a production city, and wrote brilliant inscriptions 
"study," "struggle," study Marxism and Leninism," "develop 
production," and "never be tainted with the bureaucratic work 
style" for them. These directives and inscriptions have always 
stimulated and inspired the broad masses of cadres and the 
people across the province. During the past 40 years and more, 
the previous provincial party committees and governments led the 
people across the province to follow the directives of Comrade 
Mao Zedong, strived to study Marxism and Leninism, promoted the 
work style of arduous struggle, made all-out efforts to develop 
production, to build the barren northern border areas into the 
major commodity grain base, major industrial base and open 
forward front of the whole country, and achieved great progress 
and development in all undertakings in the whole province. 
  The greatest contributions of Comrade Mao Zedong were his 
unceasing efforts to pool the wisdom of the entire party during 
the protracted practice of the revolution, to successfully 
combine the universal principle of Marxism with the specific 
practice of China's revolution, to realize the first historical 
leap forward by combining Marxism with our country's practice, 
and to form a scientific guiding ideology that suits China's 
situation--the Mao Zedong thought. Mao Zedong thought is not 
only a brilliant banner guiding China's revolution to turn 
defeat into victory and to move from victory to victory, but 
also a powerful spiritual weapon for recognizing and 
transforming the world. Being proved by practice as the correct 
theoretical principle and a summary of experiences, and the 
application and development of Marxism in China, the Mao Zedong 
thought was, is, and will be our guiding ideology in the future. 
  Following Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Deng Xiaoping led the 
Chinese Communist people to act in accordance with the basic 
principle of the Mao Zedong thought, summed up the positive and 
negative experiences, recognized the objective law of building 
socialism, and proposed the theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. This theory has quite systematically 
answered a series of questions, such as how to build socialism 
and how to consolidate and develop socialism in a country such 
as China where the economy and culture are fairly backward; 
inherited, enriched, and developed the Mao Zedong thought with 
new ideologies and viewpoints. It is China's Marxism of the 
present age. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Marxism is like a 
banner." During its early period of establishment, the Communist 
Party of China earnestly wrote Marxism and Leninism on its own 
banner. After the Yanan rectification of incorrect work style 
and the seventh party congress, it also earnestly wrote the 
ideology which combined Marxism and Leninism with the practice 
of the Chinese revolution--the Mao Zedong thought--on its own 
banner. Beginning with the convocation of the third plenary 
session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and through the 12th, 
13th, and 14th party congresses, our party also solemnly wrote 
the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics on its own banner. This is a great 
banner for developing the socialist cause and a powerful 
spiritual pillar for national regeneration and development. 
During the past 15 years, thanks to our efforts to hold aloft 
this banner, our party and our country succeeded in overcoming 
all sorts of difficulties, and making economic construction, the 
comprehensive national strength, and the level of living of the 
people jump to a higher and big stage. Under the situation of 
drastic changes in world situation, the socialist system of 
China has experienced all sorts of severe tests, showed great 
vitality, and made great achievements of worldwide attention. 
History and practical experience have repeatedly showed that 
upholding the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics means upholding and 
developing Marxism, Leninism, and the Mao Zedong thought. Our 
party has used the Mao Zedong thought to educate the people of a 
generation, and enabled us to win the victory in China's first 
revolution of establishing the people's political power. 
Likewise, if we use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole party 
and educate the people, we will surely win a victory in China's 
second revolution of promoting reform and opening up, and 
realizing socialist modernization. 
  Lenin once said: The best way to celebrate this 
commemorative date of great revolution is to concentrate our 
attention on the unfulfilled revolutionary task. At present and 
for a considerable long period of time to come, the central task 
of our whole party and the whole country is to further 
emancipate and develop the productive forces, carry out 
modernization construction with one heart and one mind, and 
build China from an underdeveloped socialist country into a rich 
and strong democratic and civilized socialist country. For this 
reason, we must accelerate the establishment of the socialist 
market economic system, and push economic construction to a new 
stage better and more quickly. We should fully recognize that 
difficulties and opportunities will coexist in realizing this 
task. The "decision of the CPC on some issues concerning the 
establishment of the socialist market economic system" adopted 
at the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
is a grand blueprint for realizing the transition from old 
economic systems into new ones and the program of action for 
guiding the whole party and the people across the country to 
spare no efforts to accelerate reform and development. The 
issuance of the "decision" has created a favorable environment 
and conditions and provided historical opportunity for 
fundamentally solving the in-depth contradictions that restrict 
our province's economic development. At the same time, it will 
also make our province meet some new problems and difficulties. 
Through deeply studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, we should unify thinking, seize the 
opportunity, accelerate the establishment of a new system and 
new order of the socialist market economy, promptly solve all 
sorts of contradictions emerged in the course of reform, and 
enable our province to enter the path of sustained, speedy, and 
sound development. 
  Comrades: Under the new situation of reform, opening up and 
socialist modernization, let us continue to uphold and develop 
the Mao Zedong thought, rally closely around the Party Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus under the 
great banner of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, uphold the party's basic 
line, work with one heart and one mind, be keen on reform, work 
in a down-to-earth manner, engage in arduous struggle, and 
advance courageously.

  [Text] On 1 February, the Harbin Railway Transportation 
Intermediate Court sentenced to death two exceptionally serious 
murderers who stole a gun and killed persons. 
  On the evening of 31 May last year, (Ma Zhanxiang), (Sha 
Zhufu), and (Zheng Erli) sneaked into the office of the No. 2 
plant of the Harbin city vehicle company in order to attempt 
robbery. 
  (Gao Jinzou), a civil policeman of the railway goods yard 
police substation of the Harbin Railway Station, discovered 
these three suspicious-looking persons and prepared to take them 
back to the police substation for questionning. These three 
criminals robbed (Gao Jinzou) of his 54-caliber gun, and he died 
after being stabbed in 16 places. The three criminals took the 
gun and ran away. 
  In the first ruling on the case, the Harbin Railway 
Transportation Intermediate Court sentenced (Ma Zhanxiang) and 
(Zha Zhufu) to death. Being under-aged when he committed the 
crime, (Zheng Erli) was given a lighter sentence of life 
imprisonment. 
  Although the three criminals lodged appeals after the first 
ruling, the provincial higher court overruled the appeal in the 
second ruling so that the original judgment stands.

  [Text] Recently, most localities in the province have 
adopted effective measures to keep commodity prices and markets 
stable. Prices of grain, edible oil, and such major foodstuffs 
as meat and vegetable have already declined from the upward 
trend. Prices of household electric appliances and other 
manufactured goods for daily use have been basically stabilized. 
Supply of goods on markets before Spring Festival have been 
ample, and both purchases and sales have been brisk. 
  In November and December 1993, large-scale price hikes 
emerged on the province's markets, drawing the concern of the 
provincial and local governments. Since then, various 
localities have given full play to the role of the price 
regulation fund to help lower commodity prices. Dandong and 12 
other cities have allocated 17.27 million yuan to subsidize 
price differences. Shenyang city that has not yet set up the 
price regulation fund has also released 6 million yuan from the 
city revenues to subsidize price differences. Many cities have 
also adopted such administrative measures as restricting prices 
and reducing the rate of profits to ensure the stability of 
commodity prices on markets. 
  To this report, this station has added a commentary 
entitled: 
"Decontrol Does Not Mean Washing One's Hands." In the preceding 
period, prices of some major daily necessities in the province 
hiked to some extent. In addition to such objective reasons as 
the commencement of new tax system in the near future, the price 
hikes emerged first in southern China, and weather changes, 
people's vague understanding of the price reform was the 
essential reason for this situation. Some people maintained: 
Price reform means decontrolling prices; and decontrolling 
prices means having enterprises and managers decide prices 
freely and having markets themselves decide prices without any 
degree of state interference. The managers with such an 
understanding frequently raised prices accordingly whenever 
there was a sign of price hikes. Some others drove up prices in 
defiance of laws and discipline and spoke plausibly: When you 
increase wages, I increase prices; and when you collect tax, I 
shift it to price hikes. This is called "when the river rises 
the boat goes up." If we act like that, a considerably great 
portion of the material benefits brought by China's economic 
reform to the people will go to the pockets of such persons, and 
it is difficult for us to achieve success in price reform. In 
fact, decontrolling prices does not mean that the government 
should no longer manage prices; and making markets themselves 
decide prices does not mean no longer requiring state 
interference. Keeping the general level of prices stable and 
preventing galloping inflation is a goal pursued by almost all 
countries in the world, as well as an important means of our 
country to carry out macroeconomic control and ensure social 
stability. How to successfully stabilize prices and make prices 
flexible, but not chaotic, is a new task facing all levels of 
governments at present. Were not the price hikes at the 
preceding period rapidly checked and turned down through the 
positive and effective interferences of governments at all 
levels? This shows that the government's interference on prices 
is necessary. This also proves that the government is able to 
use legal, economic, and administrative means to manage prices 
well in the course of carrying out price reform and to make 
price reform satisfy all fields.

  [Excerpt] A provincial banking work conference was 
convened in Xining yesterday. At yesterday's conference, 
provincial Vice Governor Liu Guanghe delivered a speech in which 
he stated: This year, the province's banking work should focus 
on raising construction funds through all channels. Last year, 
the province's bank deposits registered an 18.86 percent 
increase and loans an 28.27 percent increase, totaling more than 
3 billion yuan, while the province's insurance premiums income 
exceeded 110 million yuan. 
  Vice Governor Liu Guanghe noted: This year, the province's 
banking departments should make continued efforts to raise funds 
through all channels and should whole-heartedly support 
provincial wide economic construction. To this end, he said, 
first, the province's banking departments should carry out basic 
work in a down-to-earth manner, exert their utmost to increase 
bank deposits, and take basic work as an important criterion for 
appraising overall work performance. Second, they should make 
flexible use of funds, speed up free flow of funds, and achieve 
higher funds utilization efficiency. The principal leaders of 
various localities and professional departments should take 
personal charge of loan recovery work in the same way they do 
loan provision work. Third, the province's banking departments 
should work hard to explore and discover new capital 
coordination channels to absorb as much idle capital in the 
society as possible. Moreover, banking departments should make 
every possible endeavor to ensure smooth issuance of local 
construction and enterprise bonds, safeguard and rectify the 
banking order, and ban irrational capital outflow. Fourth, the 
province's banking departments should make active efforts to 
raise all sorts of funds, develop insurance undertakings, 
increase insurance premiums income, and increase credit and loan 
sources. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Yesterday, the autonomous regional party committee 
and people's government held a discussion meeting, attended by 
principal leaders of prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and 
cities. At the meeting, principal leaders of prefectures, 
autonomous prefectures, and cities exchanged their views on the 
progress of last year's work, the experience they gained and 
what they learned therefrom, as well as their plans for the new 
year and their hopes and proposals for the autonomous region's 
policy on macroeconomic regulations and control. 
  After hearing reports by leaders of various prefectures, 
autonomous prefectures, and cities, regional party Secretary 
Song Hanliang pointed out: Whether or not the reform, opening 
up, and economic development carried out by Xinjiang can be 
accelerated depends on the actual progress made by various 
prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities; and also 
depends on how the frontline leaders command and organize their 
men to implement the policies. 
  He said: Our regional and border trade reflects that a 
market mechanism is gradually taking shape in Xinjiang. Guided 
by the principle of emancipating the minds, the government 
formulated a series of essential policies, which played an 
important role in providing services and improving 
infrastructural facilities in various ports. If the same thing 
is done in our industrial and agricultural sectors as well as to 
our infrastructure, we can achieve development with great speed 
and high-efficiency. 
  Leading comrades of Xinjiang Autonomous Region, including 
Abulaidi Amudurexiti, Zhang Fusen, Wang Lequan, Keyum Bawudun, 
Zhou Shengtao, and Hailiqiemu Silamu, also attended the meeting.

  [Text] An autonomous regional conference on economic work 
and trade was held in Urumqi yesterday. Autonomous regional 
leaders Abulaiti Amudurexiti, Wang Lequan, and Keyum Bawundun 
attended the conference. 
  In 1993, our region reaped bumper harvests in agriculture, 
registered industrial growth, enjoyed booming market activity, 
conducted brisk border trade, increased financial revenue, 
improved living standards, and achieved initial success in 
implementing central macroeconomic regulatory and control 
measures. By and large, Xinjiang enjoyed good financial order 
and economic operations. Nevertheless, secondary and tertiary 
industries, which are primarily based on village and town 
enterprises, still constituted a small proportion of the 
economy. Although industrial production developed well, the 
general level of economic efficiency in enterprises remained 
low. 
  The general guiding thought for our region's economic work 
and trade in 1994 is: Earnestly implementing the guidelines of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and 
the Sixth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Xinjiang 
Autonomous Regional Party Committee, turning reform into a 
driving force, focusing on development, exploiting resources, 
optimizing the economic structure, opening wider to the outside 
world, improving economic efficiency, and promoting rapid 
development of Xinjiang's economy based on high efficiency. This 
year, we should expedite the pace of deepening reform in 
state-run enterprises, further improve large and medium 
enterprises, vigorously advance tehnological progress in 
enterprises, and further improve quality control. We should 
also accelerate the development of village and town enterprises, 
nurture new economic growth sectors, accelerate economic and 
market development, increase commercial and trade flows, tighten 
and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, and coordinate 
work in all aspects of economic operations.

  [Text] An autonomous regional conference on planning and 
prices was held in Urumqi recently. Autonomous regional leaders 
Abulaiti Amudurexiti, Wang Lequan, and Keyum Bawundun attended 
the conference. 
  In carrying out planning and pricing work in 1993, Xinjiang 
unremittingly carried out the central task of economic 
construction and endeavored to solve salient problems that had 
surfaced during the course of economic operations, in accordance 
with the arrangements made by the autonomous regional party 
committee's work conference. This helped promote economic 
development. The gross regional product in 1993 is expected to 
total 37.7 billion yuan, an increase of approximately 10 percent 
over the preceding year. 
  In carrying out planning and pricing work in 1994, Xinjiang 
should strengthen the status of agriculture as the foundation of 
the national economy, and stabilize the household contract 
responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, as 
well as the dual management system that combines household with 
collective operations. It should make efforts to restructure 
the rural economy and crop farming, and steadfastly engage in 
the construction of infrastructure, basic industries, and 
industries producing major raw and semifinished materials, in 
order to ease "bottlenecks" and create fine conditions for 
developing the economy and opening up to the outside world. In 
1994, we should place greater emphasis on assessing and making 
flexible use of our reserves and assets, and intensify 
technological transformation, while maintaining moderate growth 
in capital construction investment. To meet the demands of 
exploration and development at the three major oil fields in 
Xinjiang, we should closely integrate technical transformation 
with capital construction, develop a number of related 
industries that serve the needs of oil fields, and promote oil 
field development. We should ensure that oil fields and the 
local economy spur each other on for the sake of common 
development. 
  While continuing to accelerate economic development in the 
comprehensive economic development belt north of Tian Shan, we 
should also place great emphasis on economic development in 
southern Xinjiang. We should increase capital construction 
investment, expedite poverty relief work, and gradually narrow 
the gap between southern and northern Xinjiang.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xu Jingyue (1776 0079 6460)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (XINHUA) -- Zhang Wannian, chief of 
general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army [PLA], 
said today that as a military command office of the entire army, 
the General Staff Department must study well Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, regarding it the 
paramount task and fundamental project essential to carrying out 
this year's military work and strategy and to strengthening the 
department's construction. 
  Zhang Wannian today exchanged views on what has been gained 
from studying the book with members of the core group of the 
General Staff Department Party Committee and students attending 
the first study class for Volume 3 of the Selected Works 
of Deng Xiaoping. The study class was held for the General 
Staff Department's leading cadres at the army and divisional 
level; most of the students attending the study class are from 
the department's bureaus and academies. The students scored 
initial success by studying the original work in a down-to-earth 
manner, by profoundly grasping its basic viewpoints, and by 
linking the study with practical problems. Zhang Wannian 
stressed: Party committees of the General Staff Department and 
leading cadres at all levels must study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping with a strong sense 
of political responsibility to the party and to the cause of 
army building, lay a strong ideological and theoretical 
foundation for upholding the party's absolute leadership over 
the army, ensure adherence to the correct orientation in very 
complex situations, and consciously maintain a high degree of 
unity with the party Central Committee and the Central Military 
Commission. 
  Zhang Wannian pointed out: We must study the original work 
in a down-to-earth manner, grasp its spirit, and concentrate on 
grasping its standpoint, viewpoints, and methodology. At the 
same time, we must closely link the study with practical 
military work, use the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping as guide, and improve our ability to analyze and 
resolve problems. First, we must integrate study with the 
reality of the ideological field, further emancipate our minds, 
acquire new ideas, and enhance our unshakable faith in 
implementing the party's basic line. Second, we must integrate 
it with the reality of reform, opening up, and the development 
of a socialist market economy, profoundly understand and firmly 
implement party and state policies in promoting reform, and keep 
our troops highly stable, centralized, and unified. Third, we 
must integrate it with the reality of the department's work and 
work hard to enhance our political consciousness in upholding 
the principle of the party commanding the gun, our strategic 
sense in developing plans from a macroscopic perspective, our 
strong sense of responsibility toward national security and army 
building, and our sense of leadership in placing stricter 
demands on ourselves in everything we do. Fourth, we must 
integrate it with the reality in party building and work hard to 
create a good image of our party committees and leading cadres 
at all levels. Fifth, we must integrate it with the reality of 
our workstyle, firmly overcome formalism, carry out our tasks in 
a down-to-earth manner, pay attention to work at the grassroots 
level, and continue to improve efficiency in guidance work.

  [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Wannian, a 
senior leader of China's armed forces, has pledged to promote 
the construction and reforms of the People's Liberation Army 
(PLA) in the new year. 
  Speaking at a meeting here yesterday, Zhang, chief of the 
general staff of the PLA, said that 1994 is a year crucial to 
the success of China's reforms, opening up and economic 
construction. 
  "Present developments make it imperative for us to promote 
the PLA construction and reforms and comprehensively enhance PLA 
fighting capabilities in order to provide a powerful guarantee 
of safety for China's reforms, opening up and modernization 
drive," he told senior officers. 
  According to General Zhang, in the new year all PLA officers 
and soldiers must follow Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas on army 
construction during the current period. 
  Zhang, who is also a member of the Central Military 
Commission, said that it is imperative for PLA army officers and 
soldiers to take the study of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping" and the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as a primary task. 
  The general also stressed the importance of improving 
political consciousness and military skills of officers and 
troops, and of stepping up the reinforcement of leading bodies 
at all levels.

<F P=106> [By Cheng Te-lin (6774 1795 2651): "CPC is Going to Improve </F>
Equipment of Its Navy and Air Force"] 
  [Text] According to well-informed sources, on 5 January, 
accompanied by Navy Commander Zhang Lianzhong; Defense Minister 
Chi Haotian; Wu Bangguo, secretary of the party committee of the 
Nanjing Military Region; the veteran general Li Desheng; and Li 
Jiejun, director of the General Office of the Central Military 
Commission, a certain CPC elder paid a call at the Command Base 
of the Donghai Fleet at the mouth of the Wusong River, Shanghai 
to inspect a nuclear-powered missile submarine which was 
officially put into service that day. According to informed 
sources, it is China's 11th nuclear-powered missile submarine 
with 8,000 tonnes displacement and is an improved model 
Xia-class nuclear-powered missile-launching submarine. The 
submarine was originally scheduled to be launched on 1 January, 
but in order for the CPC elder to inspect it, it was not 
officially put into service for the Donghai Fleet until 5 
January. 
<H5>  China is Capable of Returning a Nuclear Attack </H5>
  The informed sources added: After meeting with 
representatives of the navy's nuclear submarine, missile 
destroyers, and airborne troops, the elder gave a speech: "I am 
very glad today. As a citizen, an old party member, and a 
veteran, I express gratitude to our people's Army and to our 
defense and scientific and technological experts! During the 
hard times in the 1960's, we exploded the atomic bomb, breaking 
through the nuclear monopoly and nuclear threat of the major 
powers. In the turbulent years of the 1970's, we upgraded 
nuclear weapons. This demonstrated that China was capable of 
developing and improving nuclear weapons and defending itself. 
In the years of reform and opening up which centered on 
economic development during the 1980's, we developed 
intercontinental missiles, nuclear-powered submarines, and 
others things, by which we declared to the world that China is 
capable of returning a fatal blow to any aggressor that launches 
a nuclear attack. In the years between 1990's and the year 
2000, depending mainly on our own capability, we must change the 
equipment of the navy and the air force quite considerably. 
This is the policy of the central authorities. 
<H5>  Hegemony Fears China's Development </H5>
  This elder continued: Hegemony and power politics and their 
followers themselves do not want to reduce their armaments or 
totally ban and destroy their nuclear weapons, and yet they are 
against and fear China's developing a modernized military 
capability. Isn't this overbearing! Now that they see that 
China is developing a little quicker and that its national 
strength is a little bigger, they criticize, fan feelings, and 
create the theory that China is going to threaten its neighbors. 
This has always been a means used by power politics and 
anti-Chinese and anti-communist political forces. The Chinese 
Government solemnly declares that it will not be militarily 
aligned and will not interfere and intervene in the internal 
affairs of another country and that it insists on resolving 
differences, disputes, and problems left over from history 
between nations by peaceful and fair ways of negotiation which 
is to seek common ground while reserving differences. China 
will never pursue hegemony in the international arena nor will 
it pursue special privileges in a region as a "small 
hegemonist." China maintains that all countries are equal 
despite their size and strength. Therefore, China did not, does 
not, and will never accept interference in China's sovereignty 
and internal affairs of hegemony and power politics or their 
ordering about; nor will it be daunted by their political 
challenges such as economic sanctions, unilaterally dishonoring 
communiques or joint declarations between nations, or rejecting 
agreements between the governments of nations. Rather, what they 
are doing will help the entire Army and people across the 
country to be united more closely, to take their own way more 
determinedly, and to have a more better understanding that only 
when the country is unified and strong and has the initiative in 
its hands can it really enjoy equality, freedom, and democracy. 
  The elder's speech, which lasted nearly 20 minutes, won 
eight 
rounds of warm and long applause.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Make Great Efforts To Carry </F>
Forward the Hard-Boned Spirit"] 
  [Text] Following in the footsteps of the People's 
Liberation Army's [PLA] triumphant advance, the "Hard-Boned 6th 
Company" has been through the glorious course of combat. On the 
30th anniversary of the naming of this collective of heroes by 
the Ministry of Defense, we send warm congratulations to all the 
officers and men of the 6th Company and pay high respect to 
leaders at all levels and the broad masses who have spent a 
great deal of effort for the growth and progress of the 6th 
Company! 
  Great times have produced a great Army and the revolutionary 
spirit has nurtured a collective of heroes. As an all-round 
tough heroic company and a flag for the basic-level army 
building of the entire PLA, the "Hard-Boned Company" is the 
inevitable result of implementing the PLA's goal in earnest and 
carrying forward the fine tradition of the people's army as well 
as the model that resolutely implements Mao Zedong's military 
thinking, Deng Xiaoping's thinking about army building during 
the new period, and Chairman Jiang Zemin's "five-sentence" 
general demand. Their fundamental experience is carrying 
forward the hard-boned spirit of the proletariat. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "The work style of 
the Hard-Boned 6th Company is not only the work style of a 
company. All companies as well as cadres at all levels should 
learn diligently and train laboriously like they do and should 
have political thinking like theirs." Military Commission 
Chairman Jiang also pointed out: "The hard-boned spirit is the 
PLA's fine tradition and precious spiritual wealth. This spirit 
is embodied in the fact that no matter what difficulty one is 
faced with, one does not yield, dares to struggle with it, and 
courageously makes sacrifices until one triumphs over it. This 
hard-boned spirit is needed both in wartime and in peacetime." 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's and Chairman Jiang Zemin's important 
instructions have made a high, summing-up appraisal of the basic 
experience of the "Hard-Boned 6th Company," revealed the rich 
contents of the hard-boned spirit, and given a direction for the 
entire PLA to learn from the Hard-Boned 6th Company and for 
strengthening the all-round buildup of the troops. 
  The PLA has large numbers of heroes. The hard-boned spirit, 
which was produced in the battlefield of blood and fire, is not 
only the spirit of a company, but also the common spiritual 
wealth of the PLA. This spirit fully embodies the "five types 
of revolutionary spirit" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, 
vividly reflects the firm political position and lofty 
ideological virtues of the officers and men of the entire Army 
and their fighting will of making sacrifices courageously, and 
fully demonstrates the PLA's strict army discipline and the 
spiritual mood of being an army that captures every stronghold 
it fights against and wins every battle it fights. In the new 
historical period, energetically carrying forward this spirit is 
of very great significance to consolidating our political 
beliefs, withstanding all sorts of tests, strengthening the 
all-round buildup of the troops, and improving their combat 
effectiveness. 
  The PLA is a strong pillar for the people's democratic 
dictatorship. It shoulders the sacred mission of protecting the 
security of the motherland and offering a safe environment for 
reform and opening up and the modernization drive. Properly 
carrying out the glorious functions of the people's army 
presents a heavy task and numerous difficulties and tests. We 
must arouse morale and encourage the fighting will with the 
hard-boned spirit, be unyielding before the enemy, not fear 
difficulties, step forward bravely in times of danger, and 
always maintain the powerful strength of overcoming the enemy, 
unyielding tenacity, and stamina of persevering to the end. 
  Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit demands that we study 
basic Marxist theories in earnest, arm the brains of officers 
and men with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas on army 
building during the new period, lay a solid ideological 
foundation, and enhance the initiative and determination to 
implement the party's basic line. 
  Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit demands that we 
standardize army building at the basic level, attach importance 
to basic-level units every year, lay a foundation every year, 
carry the nurturing of the hard-boned spirit through in all the 
jobs of every company, and bring up large numbers of companies 
that are as tough overall and as "politically qualified, 
militarily tough, possessing a fine work style and strict 
discipline, and providing effective safeguards." 
  Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit demands that we 
educate officers and men to steel themselves in the course of 
struggle so that they can defend the country and guard the 
border courageously and tenaciously, take part in rescue and 
disaster relief operations in a self-sacrificing manner, and 
undertake demanding and strict military training, acquire 
knowledge in earnest and painstakingly, overcome new, key 
technological research problems, and be devoted to production 
and work. 
  Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit also demands that we 
uphold the integration of the revolutionary spirit and a 
scientific attitude and the integration of inheriting ideas and 
bringing forth innovations so that it retains the traditional 
content full of vitality while continuously injecting the spirit 
of the new times, continuously building up a modernized, 
regularized, and revolutionary Army.

(6855 0645 4099): "Firm Steps Taken To Manage the Armed Forces 
According to Law--Review and Prospects of the Building of the 
Military Legal System"] 
  [Text] Guided by Deng Xiaoping's thinking on the army 
building in the new period and the Central Military Commission's 
principle of administering the armed forces according to law, 
the building of legal system in the military has made great 
progress in China over the past year, during which defense and 
military legislation was accelerated, military laws and 
regulations were put into practice, theoretical studies of 
military law were earnestly conducted, education on legal system 
was penetratingly carried out, and legal services were widely 
proffered, thus providing a powerful legal guarantee for the 
building of national defense and the Army's drive for 
modernization. 
  Suiting the needs of establishing a socialist market 
economic structure and quickening the pace of national defense 
and military legislation. According to the Central 
Military Commission's legislation plan during the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan period, which is signed by Chairman Jiang Zemin, 
and accepted by Vice Chairmen Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen after 
the conclusion of the First Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC], Qin Jiwei, vice chairman of the NPC 
Standing Committee, and Chi Haotian, minister of national 
defense, convened and presided over a symposium on national 
defense legislation, which was participated in by the newly 
elected members of the NPC Standing Committee and its special 
committees from the armed forces, as well as leading cadres from 
relevant units of the three general departments of the Central 
Military Commission. The symposium analyzed and studied the 
situation in military legislation and proposed to accelerate the 
work of national defense and military legislation. Having been 
approved by the State Council and the Central Military 
Commission, a national defense law drafting committee was set 
up, and the curtain was finally raised on drafting the "Law on 
National Defense"--a basic law which will play a leading role in 
the building of national defense and the armed forces. As 
required by the abovesaid plan, nine military and military 
administrative laws and regulations including "Regulations on 
Soldiers in Active Service," "Regulations on Management of 
Wireless Facilities," "Regulations on Garrisons on Duty," 
"Regulations on Management of Logistic Grass-roots Units," and 
"Stipulations on Filing of Military and Military Administrative 
Rules and Regulations" have been formulated, revised, or 
promulgated in recent years. The general departments, armed 
services and branches, major military regions, and the 
Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National 
Defense have also promulgated more than 600 military and 
military administrative rules and regulations, which have 
provided the legal basis for the Army's drive for modernization, 
and have exercised a positive role in defending the state's 
military interests, safeguarding the legitimate rights and 
interests of the Army and military personnel, maintaining a high 
degree of stability, centralization, and unity in the Army, and 
enhancing the fighting capacity of the troops. 
  Vigorously intensifying the enforcement, supervision, 
and examination of the military law and facilitating the 
implementation of the principle of administering the Army 
according to laws. Leading cadres and organs at all levels 
have repeatedly enhanced the consciousness of administering the 
Army in accordance with laws, standardized army building in a 
comprehensive way strictly according to relevant regulations, 
repeatedly elevated the level of making policy decisions, 
exercising management, conducting training, and leading the 
troops in accordance with laws, and established a good training, 
working, and living order and a sound order of combat readiness. 
Following the examination of enforcing the "Law on Protecting 
Military Facilities" and the "Regulations on the Management of 
Army's Real Estate," an overhaul of enforcing the "Regulations 
on Military Training" has been organized within the entire Army, 
by which the conditions of enforcing training regulations have 
been examined in the military regions of Shenyang, Beijing, 
Lanzhou, Nanjing, and Chengdu, and the districts subordinate to 
them. As a result, the Army's awareness in studying, applying, 
and strictly enforcing laws has been noticeably heightened, 
training according to laws and plans has become a conscious 
action of organizations at all levels which are responsible for 
the Army's military training, the central position of military 
training has been solidified and enhanced, training order has 
been incrementally regularized, training time and content have 
been ensured, and training quality has been elevated year after 
year, thus profoundly changing the moral features of the Army. 
  Closely combining theory with the practice in the 
military legal system to boost the development of the science of 
military law. The Research Institute of Military Law under 
the China Law Society took on the key research subject during 
the Eighth Five-Year Plan--research on the building of military 
legal system. It has completed the overall design and entered 
the substantive stage of tackling the problem. With the 
approval of the State Press and Publication Administration, 
"China Military Law"--the country's only comprehensive 
periodical on the military legal system at the central 
level--has started publication and been openly put on sale 
throughout the country. Afterward, scores of special works on 
the military law and voluminous reference books including 
Chinese Science of Military Law, Chinese 
Military Encyclopedia, Separate Book on Military Law, and 
World Famous Statute Book, Volume on Military Law 
came off press one after another, and several hundred theses on 
military law with guiding theoretical and practical value were 
also published, which have filled the gap of China's theoretical 
research on military law. Centering around the pressing issue 
of national defense and military legislation, the Research 
Institute of Military Law enlisted a large number of 
specialists, academics, and practical workers to take part in 
the academic research activities. 
  Penetratingly carrying out the principle of 
administering the Army according to laws as guided by Deng 
Xiaoping's thinking on military legal system. The building 
of the military legal system is a major element of the troops 
becoming revolutionized, modernized, and regularized, and is 
also a legal guarantee for achieving the general objective of 
army building. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on military 
legal system boasts extremely rich content which covers the 
structure of army formation, military training, higher military 
education, cadres' work, logistic building, defense science and 
technology, and so on. Conscientiously studying Deng Xiaoping's 
thinking on the military legal system is of tremendous practical 
and guiding significance to implementing the Central Military 
Commission's principle of administering the Army according to 
law and doing a good job of the building of military legal 
system. 
  Expediting the process of national defense and military 
legislation. In the new year, the defense and military 
legislation, with the "Law on National Defense" as a dragon 
head, will make a giant stride. Important laws are urgently 
needed in adapting military to socialist market economic 
development through stepping up the formulation of the law on 
defense mobilization, the law on defense education, the law on 
defense science, technology, and production, the regulations on 
officers of reserve service, the law of treatment of military 
personnel, and so on; and in suiting the requirements of the 
army building to become revolutionized, modernized, and 
regularized through stepping up the formulation and revision of 
a number of important military laws and regulations, including 
those on headquarters, political work, logistic work, formation 
and management, managing soldiers, production and operation 
management, and so on, with a view to deliberately instituting 
and perfecting the military legal system and safeguarding the 
country's military interests as well as the legitimate rights 
and interests of the Army and servicemen. 
  Intensifying the implementation of the military law and 
the supervision of law enforcement. It is necessary to 
intensify the administrative awareness of leading cadres and 
organs at all levels, enhance their level of law enforcement, 
promote the implementation of military laws and regulations, and 
really form a situation in which the entire Army, from top to 
bottom, act according to laws, enforce laws strictly, and 
investigate into cases in violation of laws resolutely. It is 
also necessary to carry out supervision and examination of 
enforcing military laws and regulations in a planned way on the 
key points in light of the tasks, fully exploit the role of 
functional departments, and incrementally establish a benign 
cycle of law enforcement and supervisory mechanisms.

<F P=106> [Reporter Li Xiuqing (2621 4423 3237)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- Half of China's 
ordnance industry's enterprises are now exporting civil 
products; their total export amount reached 1.7 billion yuan in 
1993. 
  The ordnance industry, due to such factors as its poor 
compatibility with civil production in the areas of equipment 
and technical conditions, has much difficulty "switching 
production of military products to civil products." Several 
hundred thousands of staff members and workers in the ordnance 
industry, however, were not afraid of the difficulties. They 
worked hard to develop export products and helped the industry 
bring about a more than 30 percent surge in the growth of civil 
product exports in recent years. China North Industries Group, 
which is a major exporting company, doubled its export of civil 
products three years in a row. Last year, its exports of civil 
products accounted for more than half of the entire industry 
total. At present the ordnance industry exports some 500 lines 
of civil products including sporting guns, construction 
machinery, automobiles, and motorcycles to over 100 countries. 
  In promoting civil product exports, the ordnance industry 
pursues a longterm policy and gives priority to building up an 
export base. Since the 1980's, it has aggressively attracted 
foreign capital and managed some 100 types of enterprises with 
exports as the main goal. Enterprises which switched from 
military to civil production, and enterprises which lately 
turned to civil product lines persist in starting out from the 
high ground, setting their sights on occupying domestic and 
international markets, and striving to produce name-brand and 
excellent quality products.

<F P=106> [By reporter Kuo Hung-chih (0948 1347 3112): "Trend Report </F>
by Academy of Social Sciences Believes China's Economic and 
Political Reforms Will Continue To Face Difficulties This Year"] 
  [Text] A 1994 trend report by the Chinese Academy of 
Social Sciences [CASS], which will be published soon, points out 
that there will still be difficulties this year in implementing 
the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee on establishment of a market structure. There 
will be no significant breakthroughs in the effort to change 
government functions and the pace of political structural reform 
will probably not be accelerated. Moreover, if the CPC cannot 
effectively resolve the problem of corruption, social unrest may 
appear in some parts of the country because of possible 
resentfulness among the masses. 
  The report points out: A reason for the economic disorder on 
the Chinese mainland last year was that the CPC was not 
sufficiently prepared mentally for the appearance of an economic 
boom after Deng's south China tour in 1992. As a result, the 
ability of government involvement and control was unable to 
catch up with social development. Moreover, as a result of the 
reshuffle in the central and local government organizations last 
year, the morale of some officials had been sapped and they have 
taken an attitude of wait and see instead, and their ability to 
handle affairs has thus decreased. 
  The report believes that to suit rapid changes in economic 
and social fields and demand, it is necessary to split up 
government functions. But at the same time, the administrative 
power of the government should be relatively centralized, 
because without this power the government will be unable to 
exercise its functions. However, the splitting of government 
functions is often confused with dispersed administrative power 
and various government departments often make use of their power 
to restrain each other, which has resulted in low work 
efficiency. 
  The report is not optimistic about reform of government 
organizations and change of government functions this year. It 
points out: The CPC will still mainly rely on administrative 
means to exercise social control this year, and its policies 
will continue to play some superficial and temporary roles. It 
also says that all three organizational reforms on the Chinese 
mainland over the last 10 years or so were supposedly carried 
out simultaneously with the change of leadership in state 
organizations, but the first two were only touted in a big way 
before leadership changes and then petered out after the changes 
were made. 
  At the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, held last November, a "Decision on Certain Questions 
Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic 
Structure" was adopted, which will serve as a general program 
for changing the economic structure in the future. The report 
of the Academy of Social Sciences points out: Although this 
decision is operable in concrete practice, judging from the 
current management ability and authority of the mainland 
government, its implementation remains an arduous task. It 
warns that when implementing this "decision" in various economic 
reforms, its possible impact on political and social affairs 
should not be overlooked. 
  On the relationship between central and local authorities, 
the report says that it is necessary to resolve the 
contradictions between central and local authorities arising 
from the implementation of the revenue-sharing system. It 
particularly points out that with the expansion of the scale of 
opening to the outside world, there will be increasing space for 
various localities to participate in international activities. 
However, local governments should not regard participation in 
international activities as their central work. If they go 
against major diplomatic policies of the central authorities, 
the latter should deal with them seriously so that they do not 
lose their authority. 
  Many people are expecting that the change in the mainland's 
economic structure will bring forth a reform of its political 
structure. But the report believes that at present, conditions 
are still not ripe for carrying out political structural reform. 
This year, the pace of legislative work and the legalization 
drive will be faster than last year, but that of political 
structural reform will remain basically the same. 
  On the problem of corruption, the report predicts that if 
substantive results are not achieved in the "struggle against 
corruption," the masses of people will be disappointed and 
resentful, which will affect social stability to a certain 
extent. But it believes that if the CPC handles the matter 
properly, resentfulness in some parts of the country will not 
result in overall disorder. 
  In conclusion, the report of the Academy of Social Sciences 
points out: The most important work for 1994 is to maintain 
political stability and continue to strengthen economic reform 
and construction.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Qian 
Guanlin, director of China's General Administration of Customs, 
said today that the reform and development of China's customs 
must keep pace with economic restructuring as a whole, that 
customs systems must conform with internationally practiced 
regulations as soon as possible, and that as reform -- which is 
oriented to a market economic structure -- is proceeding 
multilaterally under the new situation, China's customs will 
adopt five reforms: 
  -- Reform the supervisory and management pattern and put the 
customs checking system into practice in an all-round way. This 
will change the traditional pattern whereby the customs 
over-concentrate manpower, material resources, and supervisory 
means in ports that are crowded and so have little time for 
inspection; establish the customs supervision of imports and 
exports on the basis of enterprise management and accounts 
checking; expand the time and space for supervision and 
management so as to speed up passage through customs and make 
supervision more scientific and effective, which suits an 
increased degree of openness to the outside world and the 
development of an open economy. 
  -- Deepen reform for passage through customs and establish a 
new order for passage through customs. This will, first, reform 
the customs declaration structure and foster a service market 
for customs declaration. Second, it will study and gradually 
establish a categorized management system for the passage 
through customs of the consignor and consignee or its agent of 
import and export goods, and will study and formulate 
categorized management standards -- based on risk analyses -- 
for passage through customs. 
  -- Reform the bonded system and promote the development of 
an 
open economy. As a nationwide unified and open large market 
gradually is being formed, the customs bonded system will become 
an important means whereby the customs supports the development 
of an open economy and promotes the mutual supplementation of 
the international and home markets and the two types of 
resources. Therefore, it is necessary to reform and improve the 
bonded management method and increase the legal responsibility 
of bonded managers and come closer to international standards. 
  -- Establish and perfect a customs inspection and estimation 
system, and improve professional expertise in the collection and 
management of customs and excise. It is necessary to reform the 
procedures and methods for goods inspection, price estimation, 
goods categorization, and tax calculation and collection; 
establish a keen and accurate price information system; increase 
the number of laboratories and establish their legal status; 
train a vast number of high-caliber and high-level experts on 
customs inspection and estimation. 
  -- Accelerate the integration of customs with science and 
technology. This year, the customs should use the opportunity 
afforded by the linking of the computer networks of customhouses 
all over the country to consolidate, improve, accelerate, 
promote, and apply the automatic customs declaration system; 
step up the establishment of comprehensive data banks for 
customs operations management and a variety of special data 
banks; and link the computer networks of relevant departments 
such as banks, foreign enterprises, and taxation departments.

<F P=106> ["Interview" with economist Zhong Pengrong by staff reporter </F>
Dong Ruisheng (5516 3843 3932): "Dialogue on Development of 
Capital Market." First two paragraphs is LIAOWANG editor's 
note.] 
  [Text] For many people, establishing and developing a 
capital market may be a strange concept, but it must be known 
and mastered under the conditions of the modern market economy. 
  In order to enable our readers to understand the operation 
and development of this new thing. We invited Zhong Pengrong, 
who is reputed by overseas scholars as one of the "four dragons" 
among the contemporary mainland economists, to explain the 
general information about the capital market, and explain its 
functions, developmental conditions, and rules of operation. 
  [Dong Ruisheng] Recently, the term "capital market" 
frequently appeared in the press, and many readers wrote letters 
to ask: What is a capital market? What differences are there 
between a capital market and a currency market? Could you 
please give us some information on this? 
  [Zhong Pengrong] In simple words, a capital market is a 
market for long-term loans or securities. For example, there is 
the long-term loan market and the long-term bond market or stock 
market as well. The latter two are called securities markets, 
which constitute the main body of the capital market. The 
currency market is one for short-term working funds, such as the 
short-term loan market, the market for discounting commercial 
bills, and the inner-trade credit market [tong ye chai jie shi 
chang 0681 2814 2135 0234 1579 1034]. Normally, a short-term 
financial arrangement is one of less than a year; and a 
long-term arrangement lasts a year or more. The two types of 
markets are first of all different in the mobility and 
credibility of the tools of credit being issued and circulated. 
In the currency market, there are various types of short-term 
tools of credit, such as commerical bills and short-term 
government bonds. At the same time, because of the short terms 
of various types of financial arrangements, including short-term 
loans, they do not undertake almost any interest-rate risks. 
However, financial arrangments in the capital market will have 
to undertake much greater interest-rate risks. In particular, 
corporate shares will undergo more frequent price fluctuations. 
  Another major difference between the two markets lies in 
their economic functions. The capital market mainly provides a 
mechanism for enterprises to raise their own funds and prepare 
long-term capital, and the funds raised through this market are 
mainly invested in fixed assets, thus forming enterprise 
capital. The currency market mainly helps enterprises adjust 
working funds, and the funds raised through this market are 
mainly used to make up for the short-term shortage of means of 
payment. 
  [Dong] Being one of the markets for production factors, the 
capital market has been gradually developed in practice, 
although it was not explicitly mentioned in the past. As far as 
You know, at present, at what stage of development is the 
capital market in our country now? 
  [Zhong] The main body of the capital market is the 
securities market. In my view, it should also include the 
market for property rights transfers, because property rights in 
a certain enterprise held in the form of shares and property 
rights bought directly from that enterprise are not different in 
essence. At present, the securities market in our country has 
basically taken shape. According to statistics, since the 
beginning of the pilot schemes for the adoption of the 
joint-stock system, nearly 4,000 enterprises have issued shares 
to raise funds in the process of reorganizing themselves 
according to the joint-stock system. At present, more than 150 
enterprises have their A shares listed on the stock exchanges in 
Shenzhen and Shanghai, and their total market value has exceeded 
350 billion yuan. There are more than 30 types of B shares 
worth totally more than 10 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total 
value of other securities also exceeds 100 billion yuan. 
Transactions on enterprise property rights have spread from 
Shenzhen to other parts of the country. Recently, China's first 
property rights exchange was set up in Shenyang. Generally 
speaking, however, development of the capital market still 
cannot satisfy the needs of the economic structural reforms, and 
still needs to be quickened. 
  [Dong] In our country, where the market economy is still not 
developed enough, people have acquired more knowledge about the 
functions of the commodity market through reforms over the past 
15 years, and commodity markets of all types have spread 
everywhere from cities to the countryside. This has given more 
convenience to the people in their daily lives, and has promoted 
economic development. However, in what way will the capital 
market play a positive and significant role in our country's 
economic structural reform and economic development? Would you 
please tell us your own opinion on this question? 
  [Zhong] Generally, the development and improvement of the 
capital market will be conducive to the highly efficient 
utilization and reasonable movement of funds. In any specific 
capital market, investors (referring to legal persons and 
natural persons who possess idle funds) may decide the use of 
their money according to their own wishes. The nature of 
capital lies in proliferation, so the trade and enterprises 
which yield higher returns will naturally become the targets 
pursued by investors. In an economic society with fair 
competition, trades yielding high returns are normally trades 
whose development is urgently needed in socioeconomic life, and 
whose products or services are in short supply; enterprises 
yielding high returns are normally enteprises being properly 
managed and achieving good economic efficiency. If funds flow 
to such trades and enterprises, this signifies the reasonable 
distribution and utilization of social funds, and signifies that 
the limited funds are flowing through the market mechanism and 
the auction mechanism to enterprises of high efficiency and not 
the sort of enterprises which remain inefficient. 
  [Dong] The shortage of funds is a main factor that hinders 
the development of developing countries. In our country, the 
existing scarce financial resources could not be properly used 
and distributed because of the drawbacks of the structure and 
were even wasted seriously. In view of this situation, the 
establishment and development of the capital market is of 
especially great significance for the current economic 
structural reform. 
  [Zhong] The significance mainly finds expression in the 
following points: 
  --The establishment of the capital market is the negation of 
the current funds distribution mechanism. At present, the 
distribution of investment funds in our country is mainly 
conducted in an egalitarian pattern of "cutting a cake." When 
the "cake" is being cut, consideration is given not only to the 
economic efficiency of various enterprises, but must also to 
various social, political, and personnel factors. As a result, 
enterprises achieving good economic results cannot obtain any 
funds or sufficient funds. With the establishment of the 
capital market, the distribution of funds will be regulated by 
the market mechanism, and the method of auction will be used. 
Thus, the distribution of funds will gradually be rationalized. 
  --The establishment of the capital market represents the 
reform of the current investment system and is a fundamental 
measure for preventing ill-planned [mang mu 4159 4158] 
investment and reducing waste of investment funds. At present, 
funds for capital investment and new projects mainly come from 
bank loans, and banks are all run and owned by the state. This 
means that investment risks are all undertaken by the state. At 
the same time, as state banks bear investment risks, loan users 
do not need to exercise self-control when making investments, 
and they blindly start new projects in order to contend for a 
greater amount of loans from banks. This eventually causes 
serious losses. The basic purpose of establishing a capital 
market is to create a situation in which enterprises will not 
mainly rely on bank loans to achieve funds for their long-term 
investment projects, but will raise such funds from the capital 
market in the forms of bonds and stocks. When an investor buys 
the bonds or stocks of an enterprise or a project, he or she 
casts an affirmative vote for the project. The project can be 
started only if it achieves sufficient affirmative votes. This 
means the project will not be started until it passes the 
feasibility tests of thousands of would-be investors. Thus, the 
problem of blindly starting projects and causing losses to 
investment funds, which has existed for several decades, will be 
thoroughly resolved. 
  --The establishment of the capital market will bring about 
profound changes to the enterprise system in our country. At 
present, idle social funds are mainly concentrated in the hands 
of state banks, and new enterprises are set up with loans 
offered by them. This may just lead to the establishment of 
state-owned enterprises. Enterprises founded with funds raised 
through the capital market will no longer be state-owned 
enterprises but joint- stock companies. Thus, such enterprises 
will have more flexible operation mechanisms as soon as they are 
founded. 
  --Establishment of a capital market will promote reform of 
the banking system. Under the current banking system, banks are 
"eating from the same big pot." With the establishment of 
capital banks, the function of raising and distributing 
long-term investment funds will be shifted from state banks to 
the capital market. This will directly reduce the size of funds 
in the "big pot" and will also promote commercialization of 
funds. This is itself a major purpose of reform of the banking 
system. 
  Another point should be made here. At present, in our 
country, the basic system of raising and distributing funds is: 
Individual residents (with idle funds)--state-owned 
banks--investment-makers. If there is anything wrong with an 
investment, the loan may not be retrieved. However, individual 
residents' deposits must be guaranteed and retrievable. So the 
state has to bear all the losses. In a perfect capital market, 
construction funds are raised by people launching a construction 
project directly from people who possess funds, and the 
investment risks are undertaken jointly by all parties who offer 
the funds. It should be stressed here that with the increasing 
financial capacity of banks and the increasing size of 
investments, if the current investment system is not thoroughly 
changed, the state will have to a bear heavier and heavier 
burden of investment risk. 
  [Dong] I believe what you say will enable our readers to 
more deeply understand the role of the capital market. However, 
in the current circumstances of our country, what should we do 
in order to turn a theoretical concept into a reality and to 
more quickly establish and perfect the capital market? 
  [Zhong] At the very least, we should make the following 
efforts: 
  First, price controls should be lifted in order to really 
establish the market-determined price mechanism. A major 
characteristic of the capital market is that funds are no longer 
distributed according to government plan; instead, funds flow 
according to the profit principle toward economic sectors that 
may yield better returns. If price controls are not lifted, 
some economic sectors or trades (such as railways) will not be 
able to absorb funds, although their products or services remain 
in short supply; on the other hand, some economic sectors will 
continue to be attractive to investment funds because of 
attractive prices and the handsome profits they can make, 
although their products or services are not in short supply. If 
such situation continues for a long time, this will be extremely 
unfavorable to the rationalization of the property rights 
structure. In addition, the currently existing and still 
widening gaps between localities are extremely unfavorable to 
the reasonable distribution of funds. A major factor causing 
such gaps is the serious distortion of prices of elementary 
products and of manufactured and processed products. Under the 
present situation, in a richer area with a better investment 
environment, investment funds naturally yield better returns and 
such an area is naturally more attractive to funds. On the 
contrary, it is very difficult for a poor area to keep local 
funds, and it is even more difficult to absorb external funds. 
The widening gap between rich and poor areas is not the aim of 
our reform and opening. Therefore, when establishing and 
developing a capital market, we must adopt proper measures to 
reduce the misleading effects of the differences between 
localities on the movement of funds. While the local 
governments should make efforts to increase their local economic 
strength, the central government must also formulate 
corresponding policies and measures to help localities improve 
their investment environments and raise their capacity to 
attracting funds. 
  Second, it is necessary to gradually perfect corresponding 
laws and regulations and strengthen management. At present, 
investors in our country do not have a keen sense of investment 
risks, and their investment knowledge remains limited. So their 
ability to make correct judgments is weak, and they are apt to 
be cheated. Over a long time in the past, when enterprises 
launched new projects, they had to submit plans to higher 
authorities for examination and approval. In recent years, when 
enterprises planned to adopt the joint-stock system and issue 
shares, they still had to submit their plans to the government 
departments in charge of examination and approval. So many 
investors feel that an investment in an enterprises is in 
essence an investment in the government. Therefore, laws and 
regulations must be perfected in order to prevent that some 
people practice fraud by taking advantage of investor ignorance. 
On the other hand, through more effective propaganda, investors 
should be helped to understand that the government is only 
responsible for managing enterprises and does not bear 
responsibility for financial losses incurred by investors so 
that they will increase the sense of risk and become more alert 
in making judgments. 
  Third, interest rate controls should be lifted so that the 
movement of funds can be adjusted through market mechanisms. 
This is an important condition for the formation of a capital 
market, and is also a major characteristic of it. Only after 
interest rate controls are lifted will trades and enterprises of 
good economic efficiency be able to attract funds by offering 
higher prices. In a developing nation, in a certain sense, 
funds are scarcer than other resources. So more efficient and 
more economical use of funds is of great significance for the 
nation's economic development. The establishment and 
improvement of the capital market has proven a successful way to 
achieve this purpose.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- The State Economic and 
Trade Commission will provide training for the nation's cadres 
working at enterprises and cadres involved in economic work on 
the basic knowledge of socialist market economy. The training 
will focus mainly on reform of the fiscal and taxation, finance, 
foreign trade, and investment systems and on establishing a 
modern enterprise system. Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the 
State Economic and Trade Commission, announced this in Beijing 
at the ongoing National Work Conference on Training Cadres at 
Enterprises. 
  Chen Qingtai said, as this year is a critical year for 
promoting the establishment of a socialist market economic 
system and as the reform is approaching the homestretch, there 
is a need to train a contingent of entrepreneurs who are adapted 
to the socialist market economy and to greatly raise their 
political and professional quality to enable them to contribute 
to the reform and development of the economy and enterprises. 
Main points of the current training program include: stepping 
up training of plant directors and managerial personnel to lay a 
good foundation for forming a contingent of socialist 
entrepreneurs and for raising industrial and economic levels; 
helping cadres involved in economic management to gain a better 
understanding of the socialist market economy and to bring about 
transformation of functions at government departments and to 
effect changes in enterprises' operation mechanisms; 
strengthening study of existing reform measures so that the 
broad mass of cadres involved in economic work and cadres 
working at enterprises will understand and support reform and 
promote the smooth progress of reform. 
  Chen Qingtai said the commission plans to basically complete 
training of major leading cadres at state-owned large and 
mid-sized enterprises: 20,000 by the end of February and 100,000 
by the end of May; the commission will strive to basically 
complete training of major leading cadres at the nation's 
enterprises by end October. 
  Chen Qingtai pointed out: It is necessary to step up 
enacting laws for training of cadres involved in economic work 
and cadres working at enterprises; with macroguidance, to 
gradually establish mechanisms for training whereby enterprises 
will voluntarily offer their own training programs; to conduct 
bold experiments; and to constantly promote the development of 
training work for cadres working at enterprises amid reform.

<F P=106> [By Carol Pui-yee Lai and Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] A tax revolt has broken out in China, with regional 
governments pledging to defy Beijing's orders to implement a new 
capital gains tax on property. Provincial leaders fear the new 
tax may drive away foreign investment, which has been the key to 
the fast growth of many coastal areas. 
  Officials in Guangdong, Fujian and Shanghai will delay 
implementing the tax, and instead try to bargain with Beijing. 
They have told foreign businessmen that they would be able to 
flexibly set their own capital gains tax rates on property. In 
the Special Economic Zone of Shenzhen, officials have told 
investors that property deals signed last year would not be 
subject to the new tax. 
  But the Minister of Finance, Liu Zhongli, said on Monday [31 
January] that local governments had no choice but to obey the 
new regulations laid down by the central authorities, the pro 
Beijing Wen Wei Po reported. But Liu said that any 
modifications or adjustments in the tax set by local authorities 
will be considered "invalid without any exceptions". The 
minister added that the views and suggestions of some foreign 
businessmen would be solicited before detailed regulations for 
implementing the new tax are released. 
  Shanghai's mayor, Huang Ju, is scheduled to visit Beijing 
next week to demand a reduction in the tax rate, an official at 
the city's Foreign Investment Commission said. Huang's trip 
follows an unsuccessful attempt last week by State Planning 
Commission officials to persuade the city to accept the tax. A 
delegation from Beijing which visited Shanghai last week was 
subjected to biting criticism from Huang Ju and other Shanghai 
officials. "This is a very big problem. We want to follow 
other provinces in fighting the tax," the Shanghai official said. 
  Meanwhile, Guangzhou's Vice-Mayor Dai Zhiguo told visiting 
foreign businessmen on Friday the city would send a delegation 
to Beijing before the Spring Festival to fight the tax. "Our 
strategy is to delay for as long as possible while we bargain 
with Beijing," Dai reportedly said. 
  Fujian is also now considering ways to get around the tax, 
following a special meeting of province-wide foreign investment 
officials in mid-January, a Fuzhou official said. One approach 
being discussed in Fujian is to delegate collection of the tax 
to municipal and county governments, which would be left to 
decide whether to levy the tax themselves, the official said. 
  Local officials seeking to attract outside investment are 
not 
likely to be over-zealous in administering a tax whose revenues 
flow to Beijing. But it will be extremely difficult for the 
central government to monitor compliance if implementation is 
delegated to the county and municipal level. Fujian's response 
had been prompted by news of Guangdong's intent to resist the 
new tax, she added. "Guangdong's actions are being used as a 
reference by all of us." 
  The anti-tax sentiment is strongest in coastal provinces and 
cities, where officials see it as a threat to foreign 
investment. The controversial new tax requires all capital gains 
on property to be taxed on a sliding ranging up to 65 per cent 
for gains over 200 per cent. 
  But the deductions allowable under the new law are vague and 
unclear, according to Michael Taylor, an economist at Morgan 
Stanley in Hong Kong. "This makes it impossible for investors 
to calculate their actual liability." There seems to be no 
provision for this to be offset against the profits tax of 33 
per cent to which property developers and investors are already 
liable. The Finance Minister defended the new tax as a means of 
suppressing pre-sales of property developments. 
  A People's Daily commentary on January 16 called for strict 
enforcement of the new property capital gains tax, asserting 
that the "property fad" is rearing its head again, creating a 
negative impact on national economic development and efforts to 
curb inflation." [no opening quotation marks as published] "If 
large amounts of social capital flow into property and real 
estate and it is allowed to develop blindly, infrastructure and 
the revitalisation of key manufacturing industries will be 
seriously affected," the commentary said. 
  There was little sign of resistance from provinces and 
municipalities in northern China, however, which have 
traditionally been less bold than the south in defying orders 
from the centre.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Xu Yongfu [6079 3057 4569], senior </F>
researcher in the economic research department of the Bank of 
China's Hong Kong and Macao Management Office, by reporter Sheng 
Meilan (4141 5019 5695); place and date not given: "China's 
Taxation Reform Will Not Have a Great Impact on Foreign-Funded 
Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 26 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--China 
recently promulgated a series of taxation regulations which have 
aroused a lot of response abroad. What are the advantages of 
implementing the new taxation system? How great an impact will 
it have on foreign-funded enterprises? With all these questions 
in mind, I interviewed Xu Yongfu, senior researcher in the 
economic research department of the Bank of China's Hong Kong 
and Macao Management Office. 
<H5>  The Two Old Taxation Systems Have Their Own Shortcomings </H5>
  Xu Yongfu said that in the past, China implemented "one 
country, two taxation systems." That is, speaking in terms of 
circulation tax, for foreign-funded enterprises a unified 
industrial and commercial tax was levied; and for enterprises 
set up with domestic funds, since 1984, a number of taxes such 
as value added tax [VAT], product tax, and business tax have 
been levied, leading to different tax burdens on foreign-funded 
and domestic-funded enterprises. The abovementioned two 
taxation systems have their own shortcomings. For example, the 
unified industrial and commercial tax was implemented as early 
as 1958. At that time, the enterprises' productive ability and 
technological levels were relatively low and, although the tax 
included 108 tax items and 141 tax rates, it still failed to 
include many commodities. In particular, since China began to 
import foreign funds in large amounts, many new commodities 
could not be found among the tax items, to the extent that some 
special rules had to be established for them but this lacked 
adequate legal basis. As for the VAT which is levied on 
domestic-funded enterprises, it is levied only in the production 
domain and not in others; this is not in accordance with the 
prevailing international practice and is not conducive to the 
mass and professional style of social production. Nor is it 
adapted to the adjustment of investment structure and the needs 
of economic development. 
<H3>  The New Taxation System Will Not Have a Great Impact on 
Foreign- Funded Enterprises </H3>
  "Implementation of the new circulation tax seems to have 
some 
effect on foreign-funded enterprises but actually the effect 
will not be great," Xu Yongfu explained. The old unified 
industrial and commercial tax had a tax rate ranging from 1.5 to 
69 percent, generally it was 5 to 10 percent, whereas within the 
new circulation tax, the tax rate for a majority of tax items 
falling into VAT is 17 percent; the tax rate of consumption tax 
ranges from 3 to 45 percent; and the tax rate of business tax 
ranges from 3 to 5 percent. Judged superficially, the new 
taxation system will cause some foreign-funded enterprises to 
pay additional taxes. However, in reality, after the 
implementation of the new taxation system in China, the overall 
revenue will not increase but, in concrete terms, different 
enterprises will experience different conditions. 
  Xu Yongfu thought that within the new taxation system, the 
business tax will not have a great impact on foreign-funded 
enterprises and that the consumption tax is mainly targeted on 
expensive consumer goods, which in the past were also subject to 
a higher tax rate under the unified industrial and commercial 
tax. Therefore the impact will not be great. What will be 
affected most perhaps will be VAT. 
<H3>  VAT Has a Direct Bearing on the Tax Burdens on 
Foreign-Funded Enterprises </H3>
  Xu Yongfu said that the ratio of effect on the tax burdens 
on 
foreign-funded enterprises caused by VAT which is within the new 
circulation tax, is 40:30:30, that is, 40 percent of these 
enterprises will see their tax burdens remain unchanged, 30 
percent of them will experience an increase, and 30 percent will 
have a decrease. 
  He said that the unified industrial and commercial tax which 
was collected from foreign-funded enterprises in the past, was 
levied on various links such as imports, production, and sales 
and the tax collection method was to take the tax-included price 
as the tax base and this increased the tax burden. Although VAT 
under the new taxation system is also levied on various links, 
the tax levied on a former link can be calculated with relation 
to VAT on a latter link for a reduction. Therefore, under the 
unified industrial and commercial tax, even if a certain 
enterprise enjoys a tax rate which is lower than 17 percent, due 
to taxes levied on various links, the tax burden on the 
enterprise might be higher than the 17 percent relating to VAT. 
<H5>  It Can Help China To Rejoin GATT </H5>
  Xu Yongfu said that the purpose of standardizing the 
circulation tax for foreign-funded and domestic-funded 
enterprises in China is to conform to the prevailing 
international practice. 
  He said that GATT demands its signatories give 
foreign-funded 
enterprises the treatment enjoyed by their citizens and this 
includes duties and rights. In the area of duties, 
foreign-funded enterprises must shoulder tax burdens identical 
to the ones shouldered by domestic-funded enterprises; in the 
area of rights, restrictions on the business of foreign-funded 
enterprises must be lifted, step by step, and more opportunities 
must be provided for them. For example, we restricted 
foreign-funded banks from operating renminbi business in the 
past and one of the reasons was that the tax burdens on 
foreign-funded and domestic-funded banks were different. 
  Xu Yongfu pointed out that, in general, implementation of 
the 
new system of circulation tax in China will not cause a heavier 
tax burden on foreign-funded enterprises. On the contrary, VAT 
stipulates that all the exports are free from tax and this will 
lighten the tax load of the foreign firms which have set up 
factories on the mainland. He also stressed that China will 
implement the new company tax regulations this year but this is 
mainly to standardize the income tax rates for enterprises of 
different nature in the country and will not affect the 
preferential tax policy enjoyed by foreign-funded enterprises. 
Inside the special economic zones and the development zones, 
foreign firms will still be able to enjoy the preferential 15 
percent income tax policy as well as the favorable "two waivers 
and three reductions" which they have enjoyed up to now.

villagers' committee shall review the cases of five-guarantee 
support recipients and report them to the people's governments 
of townships, minority townships, or towns. With their 
approval, their five-guarantee support shall be discontinued and

<F P=106> [By Zheng Jiaheng (6774 1367 0077): "Greater Role for </F>
Macroregulation and Control"] 
  [Text] In 1993, the State Council reviewed the situation 
and judged the times, conducted macroregulation and control, 
identified areas where breakthroughs will be made, and endowed 
regulatory and control measures with the right amount of force. 
As a result, this prevented the economy from overheating, 
maintained rapid economic growth, and basically achieved the 
planned targets. 
  In 1993, China came out on top of the rest of the world's 
economies with a 13 percent economic growth rate and gained some 
valuable initial experience in the pursuit of maroregulation and 
control under the conditions of a market economy. The world 
looked agape and praised China's success in economic 
macroregulation and control. 
  In retrospect, economic operations over the last year went 
through overheating and the attempts to get overheating under 
control. In early 1993, macromonitoring and forewarning 
indicators showed the national economy had entered the "red 
zone" and "peaked" in June, which meant it had entered the 
mid-level of the red zone. The macromonitoring and forewarning 
system gave the "overheating" warning. The central and local 
authorities took prompt and resolute measures to boost 
macroregulation and control. Through structural adjustment, 
they managed to reduce the overheating, maintained rapid 
economic growth, prevented drastic fluctuations, and stored away 
some strength for next year. Through rectification, the 
financial and circulation sectors were markedly improved in 
order and the good reformist momentum was preserved. Through 
screening, the bubble economy was curbed and effective economic 
growth was maintained. Overal economic operations in September 
fell from the mid-level "red zone" in the first half of the year 
to its lower levels and to the "yellow zone" (basically normal) 
in October. Great changes have happened in China's 
macroeconomy. Overall, it is developing in a healthy direction 
and basically has the objective of sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development. This shows that it is necessary, as well 
as possible, for the state to pursue further macroregulation and 
controls under market economic conditions and rapid economic 
development. A good start has gained some fresh experience for 
the better pursuit of macroregulation and control. 
  First, the macroregulation and control based on the review 
of 
the situation was able to exploit the timing. Last year, based 
on an objective and accurate analysis of the economic situation, 
the central authorities resolutely and promptly unveiled a 
series of macroregulatory and control measures. Decisions for 
this round of macroregulation and control were made during the 
peak of an economic cycle (in June). The measures themselves 
were unveiled in July, in contrast with the past practice of 
unveiling them when the economy hit the bottom. In this way, 
macroregulation and control was able to seize the initiative, 
cool down the economy in an orderly and steady manner, prevented 
impetuosity and, more importantly, avoided the heavy losses that 
come with a "hard landing" and drastic fluctuations. This shows 
the scientific predictability and resoluteness of central 
decisions. 
  Second, correct identification of targets for 
macroregulation 
and control and the areas for making breakthroughs. After 
analysis, the central authorities determined the overheating was 
local or confined to certain sectors and caused by confusion of 
the economic order in some sectors, not a heating up on all 
fronts. Therefore, they advised that boosting macroregulation 
and control did not mean retrenchment across the board but a 
structural adjustment. They stressed concentrating funds on the 
procurement of agriculture and sideline products, normal 
production in key state enterprises, key state projects, foreign 
trade procurements and operations, and so on, trying as much as 
possible to avoid "uniform and sweeping administrative 
measures." They succeeded in minimizing the negative impact of 
the macroregulatory and control measures. As a result of 
correctly identifying the cause of overheating and confusion, 
that is, overheated investment in fixed assets and the chaotic 
financial order, and the analysis of factors prompting the two 
to feed on each other, the central authorities chose rectifying 
the financial order and controlling excessive investment growth 
as the two main efforts, got hold of the key links, and enabled 
the entire economy to develop healthily. 
  Third, endowing macroregulation and controls with the right 
amount of force with an eye for flexibility. Unlike the "riding 
roughshod over" and hard-landing approach in previous regulation 
and control, this time a soft-landing and microscopic regulation 
line of thought was adopted, with the objectives of suitably 
cooling down the economy while not dampening motivation for 
proper and rapid development in various sectors and controlling 
economic growth, price rises, total investment in fixed assets, 
loan scale, and money supply volumes with quantified targets. 
In the construction sector, macroregulation and control was 
aimed at strictly curbing new projects and prioritizing existing 
projects according to industrial policies and construction 
conditions. With the enforcement of the maroregulatory and 
control measures, local project investment was brought under 
effective control and decreased monthly from July onward. The 
actual amount of work on construction projects for the whole 
year rose by 22 percent, still within the normal range of 
growth. The industrial production rate dropped steadily each 
month between July and October, signalling a strengthening in 
market regulation, as witnessed by normal production growth for 
products still in demand in the market. When there was a 
general shortage of funds among firms, regulation and control 
was promptly relaxed; funds were injected, and firms were in 
better shape by October. By November, the industrial production 
growth rate had stopped declining, especially that of 
state-owned industry where production grew 1.9 percentage points 
from October. Production and sales rates rose further. The 
November sales rate of all industrial products climbed further 
to 96.25 percent after ending the June to September low-level 
fluctuation. 
  Fourth, the adoption of integrated macroregulatory and 
control measures and making sure that the measures adopted are 
scientific. This time, emphasis was placed on combining 
regulation and control with reform and opening up and 
identifying rectification with reforms. Economic means were to 
be the chief method, supplemented by legal means and pursued in 
parallel with a strengthening of ideological and political work 
to foster clean government, fight corruption, and crack down on 
economic crimes. The regulation and control this time was 
supplemented with necessary administrative measures, conducted 
with equal attention to domestic and foreign markets, with 
emphasis on the banking and financial sectors. In particular, 
efforts were made to put the banking sector in order, taking 
advantage of an adjustment in interest rates. As a result, 
loopholes were plugged, formal channels established, and 
residents' savings increased significantly. This way, various 
banking and investment actions were standardized and capital 
markets were assured of healthy development. 
  Fifth, an emphasis on a correct orientation, ensuring that 
targets for regulation and control and media opinion were 
coordinated. Under the conditions of a market economy, there 
are many different interests, including the anticipations of 
local governments, firms, nonprofitmaking bodies, and 
individuals, which also play a direct role in changes in market 
demand and supply. Examples include bullishness and purchase 
decisions made in relation to inflation and value appreciation. 
Expectations decide whether one is piling or selling stock, or 
selling fast, or holding back. The vigor or laxity of 
macroregulation and control will determine the expectations of 
foreign businessmen and local governments. As a result of 
paying attention to changes in psychological expectations, 
timely efforts were made to come to grips with situations before 
they became threatening. Media propaganda was boosted, 
information provided for guidance, and policy transparency 
increased to dispel unwarranted psychological expectations. 
These were also effective macroregulatory and control measures. 
  In sum, in 1993, along with the strengthening and 
improvement 
of macroregulation and control, reform, opening up, and 
modernization moved into a new dimension, gained initial 
experience, and showed that strengthening and improving 
macroregulation and control was an essential component of 
economic work. However, to move the entire economy into a 
sustained benign cycle we need the guarantees of an economic 
structure, operating mechanism, and legal framework that are 
able to meet the requirements of a market economy. In a sense, 
macroregulation and controls can treat only the symptoms, not 
the cause of the diseases. Under the existence of two parallel 
structures, we have to further deepen reforms on all fronts if 
we want to eliminate factors that cause drastic fluctuations in 
the economy. Meanwhile, poor management remains a general 
problem, which is even more easily neglected under market 
economic conditions, as evidenced by the one-time mistaken 
concept that we could do away with all kinds of overseeing once 
prices were deregulated and the powers delegated to enterprises. 
Therefore, we have not solved the problems deeply embedded in 
economic operations and should watch out for them. 
  The main problems in current economic life are: The 
excessive investment scale of current projects, irrational 
structures, huge market price raises which have passed the 
warning line, a fragile agricultural foundation, and so on. 
Furthermore, problems such as irrational social distribution, 
generally low industrial efficiency, lethargic state-owned large 
and medium enterprises remain prominent. At present, 
macroregulation and control should focus on: Preventing serious 
inflation; maintaining suitable growth in fixed-asset investment 
and money supply; strengthening agriculture in a down-to-earth 
manner; enlivening state-owned large and medium enterprises with 
effective measures; vigorously adjusting the economic structure; 
and raising economic efficiency to ensure the achievement of the 
targets for 1994 reforms and development in a smooth manner.

<F P=106> [By Chen Liang: "Job Service Comes to Aid of `Drifters' of </F>
Sichuan"] 
  [Text] Having worked for seven weeks away from home, 120 
labourers from the villages in the backward Yilong County in 
Sichuan began to suspect that they might be into some kind of a 
swindle. 
  Locked up in the Tongge Heading Radiator Factory on the 
outskirts of Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, they worked hard more 
than 12 hours a day, but only three meals were provided for. 
  "The housing and wages stipulated on the contract were 
hollow 
words," Wang Li, head of the Yilong labour wrote to the Yilong 
Administration Bureau of Employment Service (YABES), which had 
signed the contract with the radiator factory and recruited them 
for the job. 
  "Help us, if you didn't tell us a lie," he continued. 
  Upon receiving Wang's letter, Zhang Youlun, the director of 
the employment service bureau immediately flew to Taiyuan to 
talk with the labour contractor at the privately run factory. 
  Zhang travelled back and forth between Yilong and Taiyuan 
five times. He negotiated hard and long before being able to 
get his village folks back home with their wages. 
  Compared with millions of other peasant labourers from 
China's most populous province, Wang Li and his fellow-townsmen 
were fortunate. 
  They were organized and were contract labourers with the 
local Employment Service Administrative Bureau, a new 
subdivision of the local county government, while many others 
are not. "They are blind drifters," Wang said. 
  While the "blind drifters" flock into cities in early spring 
with little idea where to locate jobs and how to secure wages 
and other benefits, the jobs and wages for Wang and his folks 
were secured. When they ran into problems, they had Zhang and 
his colleagues to help them settle the problems. 
  "Though the factory fooled both the employment service and 
us, we could still have the agency to represent us and to fight 
in our interest," Wang said. "This has made us feel safe." 
  That's the duty of the YABES, one of 50 branches of the 
Sichuan Administration Bureau of Employment Service (SABES) 
which is now spreading all over Sichuan. 
  With its branches in Sichuan and four administration offices 
in Beijing, Xiamen, Guangzhou and Haikou, SABES, as a government 
organization set up in 1987, has been providing services for a 
few hundred thousand country labourers in Sichuan who spend the 
better part of a year working away from home either in the 
province or in prosperous coastal areas and major cities. 
  More than five million Sichuan peasants working outside the 
province are sending money back to their homes, thus creating an 
important source of income to the province. In 1992, the 
labourers sent back more than 8 billion yuan ($1.38 billion). 
  But the job is not easy. 
  "No other thing is more difficult than `dealing with' 
people," Tan Renzhou, an official with SABES, said. 
  At first, the work was routine. Staff members at the 
branches of the bureau simply granted "work permits" to those 
labourers who wanted to find work in other provinces. 
  They examined tens of thousands of labourers' resumes a year 
and conducted interviews. People who applied for the work 
permit would have to prove that they were physically strong and 
had no criminal record, and pay 50 yuan ($5.7). 
  The resume plus the 50 yuan would soon land the applicants 
in 
jobs the bureau helped to locate. 
  But soon, Tan and his colleagues discovered that it was very 
difficult to locate jobs for the millions of people. To look 
for better and more openings, they had to maintain frequent 
contact with all kinds of enterprises. 
  Tan said they mainly worked with the State and 
collective-owned factories, rarely privately-run enterprises. 
  "As the go-between of the labourers and the employers, we 
are 
responsible not only to businesses, but also to our Sichuan 
labourers," Tan said. 
  To take up the responsibility, they often had to haggle with 
those enterprises to secure the best possible wages, housing, 
and working hours. 
  To make sure that the businesses followed the contract, Tan 
and his colleagues often visited those enterprises on the spot 
to check. 
  Over the years, SABES and its branches have worked out good 
relationships with Sichuan labourers and also with many 
companies across the country. 
  For instance, in 1990, the Guangda Toy Factory on the 
Dongguan County in Guangdong asked the service's main 
headquarters in Chengdu, the provincial capital, for 800 
workers. SABES handed the request to its branch in Xichong 
County, a relatively poor county with a large number of surplus 
countryside labourers. 
  Under the guidance of the county employment service, the 800 
peasants left home and began their work. They worked in teams, 
and leaders were appointed who could write to the branch 
frequently. 
  In the same year, Liu Minxian, head of the county employment 
service branch visited the factory twice. 
  As time went by those Xichong peasants gained a foothold in 
the city. 
  In comparison with colleagues in Sichuan, the employment 
service officials working in local offices are dealing with what 
they call more trifling issues. 
  Ju Haiyan, the 32-year-old woman official of the Beijing 
branch of the service, takes charge of about 10,000 Sichuan 
labourers who have obtained work permits to work in Beijing from 
the service. 
  The few weeks after the Spring Festival are the busiest 
period of the year, she said, when labourers from the 
countryside pour into Beijing and other major cities in China. 
  Besides cooperating with the Beijing Labour Bureau to grant 
the "Beijing Temporary Living Permit" to them, she said she has 
mainly handled conflicts between labourers and their employers 
in Beijing. 
  In May last year, Ju got calls from both the Sichuan 
labourers and their employer at the Beijing Plush Bird Factory 
in the suburbs of Beijing, which signed an employment contract 
with SABES. 
  The employer complained that some of the 30 workers from 
Sichuan had already left while others had stopped working. 
  But Chen Jun, the young team leader of the Sichuan workers 
reported that they had been leading a dull life, "even worse 
than that at home," and that they were earning about 200 yuan 
($35) a month, "too little to save any after eating in this 
expensive city." 
  Ju went to the factory to investigate. She found that the 
factory failed to provide the contract Sichuan workers the 
chance to see films or videos. There wasn't even a library. 
  Ju first consulted with the factory management and it 
promised to furnish a reading room and a few entertainment 
facilities, such as pingpong tables for the young migrants. 
  She also talked with the young Sichuan workers, persuading 
them that their experience working at the factory would be 
beneficial to their future development. In three days, the 
young migrants began to work again. 
  But it was still regrettable for her that the factory 
refused 
to give those labourers a pay raise. 
  "First, the average wage level of Beijing is lower than that 
in the coastal areas," Ju explained with some regret. 
  "Of course, all factories need just `cheap' labour." 
  Today, Tan, Ju and their colleagues are trying to expand the 
service's influence. 
  Tan admitted that he and his colleagues had not been able to 
strike accords with privately-run businesses and thus, they had 
not been able to secure protection and benefits for Sichuan 
workers working in those enterprises. 
  He said the service would try to amend their shortcomings. 
  "After all, if the labourers get good administration, they 
will become a huge source of wealth for Sichuan," he said.

<F P=106> ["Management Measures for Checking the Weight of Import and </F>
Export Commodities, Promulgated by the State Administration for 
the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities on 16 December 
1993"] 
  [Text] Article 1. In order to strengthen the work of 
checking the weight of import and export commodities and 
safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of parties 
concerned in foreign trade, these Measures are drawn up 
according to the stipulations of the "PRC Law on Inspection of 
Import and Export Commodities" (hereinafter referred to as the 
"Commodity Inspection Law") and the "Regulations on Implementing 
the PRC Law on Inspection of Import and Export Commodities" 
(hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations"). 
  Article 2. Parties in foreign trade must submit to commodity 
inspection organs their applications for handling the work of 
checking the weight of import and export commodities, which 
refers to import and export commodities quoted and packed 
according to weight requirements listed in the "List of Import 
and Export Commodity Categories Examined by Commodity Inspection 
Organs" (hereinafter referred to as the "Category List") or 
refers to import and export commodities to be issued with weight 
certificates by commodity inspection organs in line with the 
requirements of foreign trade contracts. 
  Article 3. For import and export commodities not in the 
"Category List" or those not issued with weight certificates by 
commodity inspection organs because they were not prescribed by 
foreign trade contracts, commodity inspection organs and the 
State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export 
Commodities, inspection organs appointed by commodity inspection 
organs, and other inspection organs authorized by the State 
Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export 
Commodities to handle the work of weight checking can accept 
applications submitted by parties in foreign trade or can be 
entrusted by organs concerned to handle the business of checking 
the weight of import and export commodities and to issue weight 
certificates in line with the provisions of these measures. 
  Article 4. The State Administration for the Inspection of 
Import and Export Commodities and commodity inspection organs 
supervise the work of weight checking carried out by inspection 
organs which are authorized or appointed by them. 
  Article 5. Commodity inspection organs handle the work of 
checking the weight of import and export commodities according 
to the means of measurement prescribed by foreign trade 
contracts. If no means of measurement are prescribed by foreign 
trade contracts, commodity inspection organs can adopt various 
means of weight measurement such as weighing apparatus, water 
gauges, vessels, and flow meters according to applicants' 
applications and specific conditions of commodities, including 
their characteristics, package categories, transportation 
conditions, and means of delivery. 
  Article 6. Personnel of commodity inspection organs who are 
responsible for weight checking must receive specialized 
training and pass examinations before they are qualified to take 
up their posts and check the weight of import and export 
commodities according to the provisions of the "Regulations for 
Checking the Weight of Import and Export Commodities." 
  Article 7. All sorts of weighing apparatus, vessels, flow 
meters and complete sets of weight-measuring implements as well 
as inspection installations can only be used after state 
departments responsible for measurement have issued certificates 
of qualified checking marked with validity dates and confirmed 
by commodity inspection organs. Units using weighing apparatus, 
vessels, and flow meters should have a concrete inspection 
system and be equipped with corresponding means of inspection 
for regular maintenance and inspection. 
  As far as large specialized weighing apparatus, vessels, and 
flow meters are concerned, commodity inspection organs must set 
up technology files for stronger supervision. 
  Article 8. Personnel responsible for measuring weight by 
weighing apparatus, vessels, and flow meters must receive 
specialized technological training and pass examinations and 
their qualifications must be confirmed by commodity inspection 
organs, while personnel of commodity inspection organs supervise 
the operation of weight measurement conducted by qualified 
personnel. 
  Article 9. Certificates of water gauge measurement can be 
treated as the basis for transactions and settlement between 
parties in foreign trade. If this is stated in weight 
provisions in foreign trade contracts, transporting ships should 
have the conditions for water gauging. If commodity inspection 
personnel examine and verify that particular transporting ships 
do not have the conditions, they will not handle the work of 
water gauging. 
  Article 10. When parties in foreign trade apply for weight 
checking, they must go through the procedure of reporting import 
and export commodities for checking according to the 
"Regulations on Reporting and Checking Import and Export 
Commodities." Moreover, they must make arrangements for 
checking the weight and provide essential working conditions 
according to dates of loading and transport, dates of 
consignment and settlement, or validity dates for claiming 
damages. 
  Article 11. For import and export commodities transported in 
bulk which have to be measured by weighing apparatus, commodity 
inspection organs should check the weight of all commodities at 
ports of loading and unloading as stated in foreign trade 
contracts or contracts of transportation. Meanwhile, consignees 
(consigners) must apply for supervision of the loading and 
unloading work. 
  Packaged or unpackaged commodities which are transported in 
clear batches without changes in weight can be checked by 
commodity inspection organs at consigners' (consignees') 
premises, by commodity inspection organs at ports, or by 
commodity inspection organs in other places. Regarding import 
and export commodities which must be checked at ports, parties 
in foreign trade should guarantee that commodities are 
transported in clear batches and that goods match what is 
described in certificates. 
  Article 12. Regarding commodities marked with their weight, 
including net weight and package weight, commodity inspection 
organs will implement spot checks on their weight according to 
the "Regulations for Checking the Weight of Import and Export 
Commodities--Checking Weight by Weighing Apparatus." 
  Article 13. Regarding commodities priced according to their 
conditioned weight or dry weight, persons who apply for weight 
checks by weighing apparatus and water gauges should ask 
commodity inspection organs to select representative samples for 
moisture content tests. 
  Article 14. Apart from applying for measurement of the 
capacity of holds carrying imported liquid commodities, 
applicants must also apply for checking of empty holds and holds 
for unloading. Dry hold certificates will be issued after 
commodity inspection organs have finished all these checks. 
  Article 15. Units involved in the work of checking the 
weight of import and export commodities must use our country's 
official units of measurement. In case of special requirements, 
measurements are still converted on the basis of our country's 
official units of measurement. 
  Article 16. Commodity inspection organs which handle the 
work of weight checking will collect fees according to relevant 
state regulations. 
  Article 17. Anyone violating the provisions of these 
Measures will be punished according to the relevant provisions 
of the "Commodity Inspection Law" and the "Regulations." 
  Article 18. These Measures are effective 1 March 1994, and 
the "Interim Measures for Checking the Weight of Import and 
Export Commodities by Weighing Apparatus" will be simultaneously 
abolished. 
  Article 19. The State Administration for the Inspection of 
Import and Export Commodities is responsible for the 
interpretation of these Measures.

<F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" column by staff reporter Xia Jun </F>
(1115 8823): "Output Value of Rural Enterprises: From 49.1 
Billion to 2,900 Billion"] 
  [Text] Township and town enterprises have become the first 
major pillar of the rural economy now, and their annual output 
value already accounts for over 60 percent of the gross rural 
output value. Thirty years ago, however, they did not even have 
their own independent "status" and were included as "rural 
sidelines" as the was the job of chicken raising by old women. 
  In 1958 following communization, in order to adjust to the 
specific environment at that time, villages in all localities 
began to run various types of small factories, called 
"production-brigade-run enterprises," which were characterized 
by groups of indigenous industries producing things like 
chemical fertilizer, pesticide, cement, steel, and processed 
food. That year, they achieved a output value of 6.25 billion 
yuan. In the 20 years that followed, the production-brigade-run 
enterprises had ups and downs in their course of development. 
By the end of 1978, the number of production-brigade-run 
enterprises rose to 1.52 million, which offered jobs for a 
surplus rural work force of 28 million people, and achieved an 
output value of 49.1 billion yuan that year. 
  Their real big development, however, began since reform and 
opening up. In the past 15 years, China's township and town 
enterprises suddenly have stood up and leapt onto the new stage 
one after another. Their total output value in 1983 exceeded 
100 billion yuan and in 1987 leapt to nearly 500 billion yuan. 
In 1991, their output value broke through 1 trillion yuan for 
the first time. In 1993 total output value reached 2.9 trillion 
yuan, net profits came to 160 billion yuan, the taxes they 
turned over to the state totaled 95 billion yuan, exports 
totaled 190 billion yuan, and they had 112 million staff and 
workers, exceeding the total number of the staff and workers of 
state-run enterprises. 
  In as short a time as 15 years, township and town 
enterprises 
have grown from a tiny and tender seedling to a big strong tree 
and have become an important pillar of the entire national 
economy. They already account for one third of China's total 
industrial output value, and they have become the main body of 
China's medium-sized and small enterprises. They are important 
income earners for the national economy, an important force that 
supports and strengthens agriculture, a major form of shifting 
the surplus rural work force, and a major force that promotes 
the development of cities and towns in rural areas. 
  True, in their course of development, township and town 
enterprises still have problems, such as, their layout is not 
rational enough, they are excessively scattered, their 
technology, equipment, personnel quality, and management 
expertise are still rather low, government and enterprise 
functions are not separated and ownership and management are not 
clearly defined, and their development in eastern, central, and 
western China is still unbalanced. These problems need to be 
resolved in the course of their future development. We have the 
reason to believe that as long as we unswervingly continue to 
walk on the right road, township and town enterprises will 
surely be able to have a brighter tomorrow which will draw 
worldwide attention.

"Rural Economy Grows in Strength, the Country is Studded With 
Townships and Towns Whose Output Value Exceeds 100 Million Yuan 
Each"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO)--Relevant 
departments of the State Statistical Bureau said today that 
townships and towns whose output value reaches 100 million yuan 
has increased from a few in the past to almost as many as the 
stars. This is a sign that the overall strength of China's 
rural economy has grown further. 
  At present, there are 4,989 townships and towns each of 
which 
has more than 100 million yuan of rural output value. Of them, 
72 exceed 1 billion yuan each and 434 exceed 500 million yuan 
each. The order of the first 10 townships and towns whose output 
value exceeds 100 million yuan each is: Caigongzhuang township 
of Jinghai county in Tianjin, Qianzhou town of Wuxi county and 
Shengze town of Wujiang city in Jiangsu, Beijiao town and 
Guizhou town of Shunde City in Guangdong, Ninghai town of 
Mouping county in Shandong, Xinzhaizi town in the Ganjingzi 
district of Dalian in Liaoning, Maqiao township of in the 
Minhang district of Shanghai, and Zhouzhuang town of Jiangyang 
city and the Luoshe town of Wuxi county in Jiangsu. 
  The assessment was made by the China Rural Society Economic 
Assessment Center under the State Statistical Bureau in the 
light of the 1992 figures. Judging from the statistics of these 
nearly 5,000 townships and towns, we find the following 
characteristics: 
  First, they have powerful economic strengths. Although the 
100- million-yuan townships and towns only account for 10 
percent of China's total townships and towns and only 20 percent 
of the rural population, yet they produce half of China's rural 
output value and 2/3 of the rural industrial output value. 
Second, they have a high degree of rural industrialization. 
The non-farming proportion of these townships and towns reaches 
as high as 88.2 percent, 24 percentage points higher than the 
national percentage. Third, their enterprises have an economy 
of scale. The output value of the enterprises of these 
townships and towns already accounts for 52.8 percent of the 
total output value of township and town enterprises in China, 
their enterprise scale is 73.8 percent higher than the national 
scale, their average labor [lao jun 0525 0971] output value is 
62.6 percent, and they produce four times as much profits and 
taxes as the national average. Fourth, 100-million-yuan 
townships and towns are found everywhere in economically 
developed coastal areas. Jiangsu has 944 such townships and 
towns, which is the highest number and which accounts for nearly 
half of the province's total townships and towns, whereas 
Shandong has 892, Zhejiang 538, and Guangdong 425.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Pan Gang (3382 1511) and XINHUA </F>
reporter He Jingsong (6320 0513 2646)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan (XINHUA) -- Minister of Internal 
Trade Zhang Haoruo pointed out at a national conference on the 
work of commerce, grain, and supply and marketing cooperatives 
today: Departments in charge of commodity circulation at all 
levels should give full play to their role as the main channel 
of circulation under the conditions of the socialist market 
economy; strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control in the 
circulation of commodities; make efforts to establish a system 
of stockpiling important commodities and risk-regulating funds; 
institute and improve a system of market monitoring and control; 
and maintain a balance between the demand and supply of 
important commodities, such as grain, cotton, oil, pork, sugar, 
and chemical fertilizers, so as to keep the markets stable. 
  Zhang Haoruo stressed: Maintaining a balance between the 
total demand and total supply of important commodities is a 
prerequisite for stabilizing commodity markets. Now the state 
has stockpiled certain quantities of grain, cotton, oil, pork, 
sugar, pesticides, steel products, copper, aluminum, oil 
products, and other commodities, but most commodity stockpiling 
systems are not sound enough. From now on, vigorous efforts 
should be made to establish the system of stockpiling and 
managing commodities and to promote the enactment of a law in 
this regard so as to manage stockpiled commodities according to 
law. At the same time, we should increase the quantities of 
stockpiled commodities; we should purchase commodities at the 
right moment to expand the commodities kept in stock and to 
enable these commodities to play a significant role in 
regulating markets. He emphasized: The right to use state- 
stockpiled commodities is in the hands of the central 
authorities; without the approval of the State Council, no 
locality or department can presumptuously use such stockpiled 
commodities. To stabilize markets across the country, it is 
necessary to give full play to the initiative of both the 
central and local authorities. Efforts should be made to 
establish a local commodity stockpiling system as soon as 
possible so as to stabilize regional markets. Commodity 
circulation departments in various localities should actively 
brief their local governments on the situation and be determined 
to allocate some funds for stockpiling commodities; they should 
determine the categories of commodities suitable for local 
stockpiling and the rational amount of each commodity to be 
stockpiled; local authorities should coordinate with the central 
authorities in commodity stockpiling to work together to 
stablize markets. To prevent excessive fluctuation in market 
prices, vigorous efforts should be made to set up market risk 
funds and to protect the interests of farmers and consumers. In 
some localities, funds have been established to regulate the 
prices of vegetables and pork which should be retained to 
stabilize market prices. Local and central risk funds should be 
put to use together to promote market stability. Meanwhile, 
various localities should establish a highly efficient market 
monitoring and control system, pay attention to market 
forecasting, and ensure the rapid collection and distribution of 
information. They should strengthen market analysis and 
forecasting and have a good grasp of market prices so that they 
can take timely measures to stabilize the markets. 
  Zhang Haoruo pointed out: State-owned and cooperative stores 
should play the role of a major channel for competition. They 
should take the initiative in entering and participating in the 
market. They must control the sources of commodities that are 
sufficient to stabilize markets. Grain departments should grasp 
the purchasing links and retain the initiative to arrange market 
supplies. It is necessary to make the production, supply, and 
marketing of pork, vegetables, and other commodities a 
coordinated process. Vigorous efforts should be made to set up 
various wholesale markets. Big and medium-sized cities should 
experiment on setting up wholesale markets which practice 
standardized management and in which trading is conducted with 
modern methods, in order to give full play to the advantages of 
state-owned and cooperative stores as a group and to conduct 
appropriate-scale trading. Departments in charge of state-owned 
and cooperative stores should resolutely implement macroeconomic 
regulation and control measures adopted by the state to 
stabilize markets and to ensure the supply of commodities 
closely related to people's livelihood.

<F P=106> ["Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Exercising </F>
Strict Control Over Excessive Investment Scale Is a Pressing 
Task"] 
  [Text] My brother: 
  The work in 1994 may be generalized into six Chinese 
characters: reform, development, stability. Reform means that 
we shall speed up reforms according to the decision adopted by 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in 
order to set up the framework of the socialist market economic 
structure; development means that we shall maintain the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 
4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the national economy; 
while maintaining social and political stability is the major 
foundation for reform and development. Correctly handling the 
relationships between reform, development, and stability will 
ensure the healthy development of the socialist cause with 
Chinese characteritics. 
  In the field of economic development in 1994, we still need 
to promptly adjust the intensity of macro-control, properly 
control the size of capital construction, the size of credit, 
and the momentum of inflation. In the action of macro-control 
in 1993, it was impossible to solve all the problems arising in 
the process of high-speed economic growth since 1992. The 
macro-control measures in 1993 curbed inflation and restrained 
the excessively growing size of capital construction and credit 
and the excessive monetary input in some sectors, but the 
problems were not thoroughly solved in the investment and 
banking systems. Now, the size of capital construction is still 
too large, and the belated effects of the excessive monetary 
input will continue to arise in 1994. It will take time to 
overcome such belated effects. That is to say, the 
macro-control tasks in 1993 have not been completed fulfilled, 
and the economy has not effected the "landing." Therefore, in 
1994, we shall continue to work for the "soft landing" in order 
to ensure the economy's healthy development and to prevent 
losses caused by violent ups and downs. 
  Now, the size of the ongoing construction projects 
throughout 
the country is much greater than that in 1991, and one third of 
such large-scale construction is supported by bank loans. If 
such a large amount of capital construction is to be completed, 
it will require excessive monetary input. How then can the 
economy endure all this? Therefore, it is necessary to actually 
cut down on the size of capital construction. In 1993, the 
party Central Committee and the State Council did not adopt 
administrative measures to order all localities to cut down on 
construction projects; instead, they mainly relied on measures 
for strengthening and improving macro- control measures. In 
1994, such practice will continue. All localities should make 
adjustments according to their own conditions, and should really 
cut down on the excessively expanded amount of capital 
construction. 
  Over more than 10 years, China's economic development has 
repeatedly proved that out-of-control capital construction is 
always the beginning of the out-of-control economic aggregate, 
in which aggregate demand substantially exceeds aggregate 
supply. Therefore, it is of great importance to reform the 
whole economic structure, including the investment structure, to 
form an investment mechanism that may properly exercise 
self-control. In 1994, the pace of reform will be speeded up, 
and this also reflects the necessity of such reform. In the 
process of forming the new investment structure, the steps for 
strengthening and improving macro-control, promptly adjusting 
the intensity of such control, and promoting the improvement of 
the economic structure and the enhancement of the economic 
efficiency are all extremely important points in the 1994 
economic work. 
  China is a large country. Any slight action of construction 
in villages or factories may bring about a tremendous demand on 
material and fund input for capital construction, and the 
swelling size of investment will inevitably strain the supply of 
raw materials and bid up their prices. Take steel products as 
an example. In early 1993, its price was 1,600-1,800 yuan per 
tonne; later, it increased to over 4,000 yuan; after the 
macro-control measures were adopted in July and August, it 
declined to a level below 3,000 yuan; but it is rising again. 
The upwward tendency of the steel and cement prices will bring 
about chain effects. This shows that it is a critical link to 
control the amount of capital construction in the efforts to 
curb the price increases. 
  Of course, this does not mean that no investment will be 
made 
in capital construction. Necessary capital construction remains 
a major means of maintaining the lasting momentum of economic 
development. What we should do is to keep construction at an 
appropriate size. Good things cannot be accomplished overnight 
or even in one single year. The structure must be rationalized 
in the orientation of strengthening the basic industries. 
Priority should still be given to such basic industries and 
infrastructural facilities as agriculture, transportation, 
communications, and energy production so the "bottleneck" 
effects of these industries which are relatively lagging behind 
may be removed. As for the development of real estate, 
especially the construction of high-class hotels, office 
buildings, luxurious villas, and holiday resorts, its scale must 
be resolutely cut down. 
  The speed of economic growth should be appropriate; the 
amount of capital construction should be appropriate. These are 
major conditions for the smooth process of reform and also major 
conditions for maintaining social stability. We must be very 
prudent on this point.

<F P=106> ["Liaowang Forum" interview with Lin Yifu by unnamed staff </F>
reporter; place and not given: "A Concrete Lecture on the 
Market Economy"] 
  [Text] The abnormal fluctuation in grain prices in certain 
localities during a previous period has aroused the close 
attention of society, and has given us much food for thought. 
In what way can we maintain better management over this special 
commodity of grain under the present market economic conditions? 
This staff reporter interviewed Lin Yifu, research fellow of 
the State Council Development Research Center, on this issue. 
  [Reporter] People usually foresee a drop in grain prices 
after grain harvests, so the recent rise was quite unexpected. 
Can you explain this phenomenon for us? 
  [Lin Yifu] Yes, in today's rural areas, control over the 
prices of grain and cooking oil have been lifted, the state 
monopoly for purchase and marketing abolished, and market 
regulations put into effect. In order to gain the initiative in 
management of the grain market, relevant government departments 
should learn to act according to the law of the market economy 
when they deal with relations between demand and supply in the 
market and with changes in such relations. For instance, 
increasing the income of peasants in grain-producing areas has 
long been a knotty problem, and also one of the major causes for 
the recent fluctuation in grain prices. It seems the best 
solution at the present stage would be for coastal provinces 
with a relatively low comparative advantage in grain production 
to reduce their grain-growing areas appropriately and give away 
a part of their grain market so they will have a greater demand 
for grain produced by grain-producing areas and can help 
increase the income of peasants in grain-producing areas through 
higher market prices. This may be an effective solution. The 
situation in the grain market last year exactly proved that the 
abolition of the policy of unified purchase and marketing of 
grain has helped us attain the goal of rationalizing the market 
setup in accordance with comparative superiority and the goal of 
enhancing the interests of grain-growers on the basis of market 
strength. This means that using the marketing concept to observe 
and analyze the rise in grain prices in grain-producing areas is 
a normal phenomenon that accompanies the structural readjustment 
of grain-producing areas. 
  Of course, we should not overlook the fact that the recent 
drastic fluctuation in grain prices is also attributable to a 
number of abnormal factors. As it is known to all, ever since 
the reform of the purchase and marketing system began in 1992, 
the basic state policy has been to "relax price controls and 
ensure grain quantity"; in other words, the purchasing price is 
to be set by the market while the state will guarantee the 
fulfillment of a fixed grain purchasing quota of 100 billion 
jin. This policy meets with no difficulties when prices in the 
grain market are relatively low. However, when grain prices go 
up, local governments always find it hard to raise the selling 
price in urban areas on the basis of the purchase price. This 
is because, on the one hand, the grain- producing areas are 
plagued by a relatively backward economic development and urban 
dwellers in those areas have relatively lower personal incomes; 
on the other hand, local financial departments find themselves 
in difficulties and are unable to give urban residents any 
further allowance on grain prices. Under such circumstances, 
with a view to fulfilling their purchase quotas at a relatively 
low price, grain-producing areas adopted the method of 
forbidding any outflow of grain from the local market before 
they can fulfill their purchase quotas during a time when grain 
prices are going up as a result of coastal provinces' increased 
demand for grain. It is true that this measure can help check 
the rise of grain prices in grain-producing areas, yet it also 
has added to the already tight situation in the grain market of 
coastal provinces, thus pushing grain prices up to such an 
irrationally high level that they are unsuited to the readjusted 
production setup. The market price will remain stable if people 
can change their way of thinking, act in accordance with the 
rule of the market, and eliminate those man-made factors that 
can cause fluctuations in grain prices. 
  [Reporter] Grain is a special commodity. How can we ensure 
stable growth in the country's grain production, prevent 
excessive fluctuations in market prices, and realize the goal of 
increasing grain production and the yield of grain-producing 
areas under socialist market economy conditions? 
  [Lin] In my opinion, the most fundamental way to do this is 
to establish a country-wide unified general market. With this 
country-wide unified market, areas with a low comparative 
advantage in grain production naturally will get out of grain 
production and will have a greater demand for grain produced by 
grain-producing areas having a high comparative advantage. The 
increase in the market demand will push up grain prices; as a 
result, the peasants in grain-producing areas can benefit from 
increased production and yield, and consequently will display 
greater enthusiasm in grain production, thus achieving the goal 
of increasing and stabilizing the grain output. This point has 
been proved correct by the grain production in 1993, and also by 
the practice of relaxing price controls on vegetables, fruits, 
and fresh aquatic products over previous years. Theories and 
both domestic and overseas practices all have proved that the 
larger the market coverage, the greater is the possibility for 
different localities to supplement each other and fewer are the 
fluctuations in the market price. The establishment of a 
country-wide unified general market does not mean on any account 
that the government will keep no control over the country's 
grain production and marketing. It is necessary for the 
government to retain the policy of "relaxing price controls and 
ensuring grain quantity," while abolishing the system of unified 
purchase and marketing. Relaxing price control is a natural 
demand of the market economy, and the key issue is how we are 
going to "ensure grain quantity" in order to suit the principle 
of the market economy while simultaneously maintaining the 
stability of the grain market. At present, China's annual 
demand for grain totals around 900 billion jin, of which 600 
billion jin is for peasants own use, while 300 billion jin is 
commodity grain. "Ensuring grain quantity" should mean ensuring 
a total supply quantity of 900 billion jin. In case the total 
grain output is lower than 900 billion jin, the state should 
draw on stocks or increase imports to make up the deficiency. 
Conversely, if the total output is higher than 900 billion jin, 
the state should reserve more grain or reduce imports so that 
there will not be excessive surplus grain. By so doing, the 
supply and demand will be in a well-balanced state, peasants' 
expectations on prices will not fluctuate following the increase 
or reduction of grain output, and the 300 billion jin of 
commodity grain will be guaranteed. Under the prerequisite of 
the socialist market economy, "ensuring grain quantity" should 
mean ensuring the total quantity supplied instead of the total 
quantity purchased. The task of ensuring grain quantity should 
be shouldered by grain departments at the central level, not by 
individual local governments. As a matter of fact, it is much 
easier to ensure a total supply of 900 billion jin than to 
fulfill a purchase quota of 100 billion jin. This is because 
over the past 40 years or more -- except for the years 1959 and 
1960 -- the country's total grain output has never dropped for 
two consecutive years, while the annual reduction rate never 
exceeded 5 percent except in a few years. Therefore, an annual 
turnover volume in state grain reserves of no more than 50 
billion jin can help maintain a stable grain price and a stable 
supply of commodity grain in the national grain market. 
  [Reporter] Can we say that the recent fluctuation in grain 
prices has showed once again that strengthening and improving 
macroeconomic control and regulation is an indispensable link in 
building up a market economy structure? 
  [Lin] Yes, and this is especially true with the management 
of 
grain as a special commodity, for macroeconomic control and 
regulation are essential with this commodity. Grain has a great 
bearing on the state planning and the livelihood of our people. 
Any abnormal fluctuations in the market price of grain which 
fail to be brought under effective control may possibly endanger 
social stability and tarnish the overall situation of reform. 
This time, because the government acted instantly and took 
resolute measures, the market price of grain returned to normal 
in less than 10 days. The measures taken by the government were 
highly prompt, necessary, and correct, which gives full 
expression to the great importance of the state's macroeconomic 
control and regulation, the position of state-owned grain 
enterprises as a major channel, and the role of state grain 
reserves in stabilizing supply and demand in the market. 
  To us, the recent fluctuation in grain prices served as a 
concrete lesson in market economics, and the measures aimed at 
stabilizing grain prices were a valuable experience for us to 
use in our future grain work.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Leclerc du Sablon in Beijing: "Intentions </F>
More Numerous Than Contracts -- Beijing-Paris: Improvements 
Will Be Gradual"] 
  [Text] After a two-year boycott by China, France cannot 
expect to secure a large number of contracts, says prime 
ministerial special envoy Alain Peyrefitte. 
  Edouard Balladur will visit Beijing on the first or last 
week 
of March, but this visit will be mostly symbolic: The 
diplomatic and commercial impact of normalized relations between 
France and China will be gradual. After a quasi-divorce, the 
reconciliation cannot bring as many benefits as did the 
"wedding" decided 30 years ago by General de Gaulle and Mao 
Zedong. 
  Although delighted with his hosts' "quite warm" attitude and 
"good will," Alain Peyrefitte ended his three-day preliminary 
mission on a note of caution: "We must be aware that 
improvements will be gradual." This comment relates to the 
trade expectations of French manufacturers, who suffered from 
Beijing's retaliatory policy following the sale of 60 Mirage 
fighter aircraft to Beijing's rival, nationalist Taiwan. 
However, improvements -- both commercial and political -- will 
clearly happen under close supervision from China's rulers only. 
  Of course, both parties seemed to enjoy repeating that 
"clouds have been dispelled." However, says Mr. Peyrefitte, 
"one cannot say that the 12 January communique -- which 
announced a return to normal relations -- settled everything." 
It is up to the prime minister to "capitalize on that." 
<H5>  A Little Help </H5>
  This comment from the former Gaullist minister has probably 
internal implications as well: Mr. Balladur's trip will be the 
first French state visit to China since Mr. Mitterrand's, 11 
years ago. Things should not happen in Beijing as they did in 
Riyadh. While it cannot yield as many contracts as Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl brought back from Beijing in November, Mr. 
Balladur's visit must not lack panache, as befits a statesman 
and potential president of the republic. 
  Admiral Philippe de Gaulle -- the General's son and a member 
of Alain Peyrefitte's team in Beijing -- did not forget to 
mention in front of Vice Prime Minister Qian Qichen that Mr. 
Balladur is a "loyal proponent of Gaullist policies." 
  Both invoking the historical credit of the Fifth Republic 
founder [Charles de Gaulle] -- the first leader of a large 
Western power to open an embassy in Communist China in 1964 -- 
and speaking of France's high-technology achievements, Alain 
Peyrefitte told Prime Minister Li Peng of potential cooperation 
in fields such as energy, transport, and telecommunications. He 
also pleaded for French cereal producers: Chinese resentment 
stemming from the sale of Dassault aircraft to Taiwan did not 
just lead to a freeze in large industrial contracts; it also 
resulted in China terminating its regular purchases of French 
wheat. In retaliation, after having uttered its indignation 
about the sale of 150 F-16 aircraft to Taiwan, Beijing had 
actually increased its imports of American wheat. 
  On the Chinese side, the message is twofold. While Alain 
Peyrefitte insisted that "a new spirit of friendship has been 
established," a Beijing-based observer of French interests said 
that "things will not go smoothly; we do not intend to fall prey 
to such delusions any more." 
  In the meantime, Li Peng said he was "very happy" with the 
Franco-Chinese detente. His own intervention was reportedly the 
decisive factor in the difficult negotiation secretly conducted 
during the Christmas season by UAP [insurance company] president 
Jacques Friedman on behalf of France's prime minister. 
  These talks made it possible for the "page to be turned." 
Chinese authorities gave up their demand that the Mirage 
contract be canceled, while Paris undertook to forbid French 
firms to "contribute to Taiwan's armament," although it did not 
forbid to "sell weapons" to the island, provided such weapons 
are of a defensive nature. The compromise was guaranteed by an 
exchange of secret letters between the two countries' Foreign 
Ministries. 
  The "little help" from China's head of government -- who was 
openly francophile until Western nations ostracized him 
following the 4 June 1989 massacre -- is not solely due to the 
fact that he would relish being invited to Paris -- and, five 
years after Tiananmen, saluting Francois Mitterrand, who had 
said at the time that a regime which guns down its own young 
people "does not have a future." 
  Chinese sources explain that Beijing agreed to a compromise 
with Paris and is likewise seeking an agreement with Washington 
in order to reestablish a political dialogue with the West. 
This has already been done with Germany, the whole strategy's 
alleged motive being to "isolate" Great Britain, guilty of 
trying to democratize Hong Kong's parliamentary system. 
  Thus Beijing admits it needs to maintain ties with Western 
countries. Even if that means painting the confession with 
jingoistic colors. Said the headline of a large Shangai 
newspaper -- the WEN HUI BAO -- last week: "Western Arrogance 
Toward China Turns Into Deference."

  [Text] Taiyuan, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin urged leading officials at all levels and all 
members of the Communist Party to work sincerely for the 
interest of the people. 
  In an inspection tour of Shanxi Province from January 29 
until today, Jiang, also general secretary of the Central 
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said that the party's 
fundamental aim and basic line is to be concerned for the 
people, to rely on the people and serve the people. 
  He urged leading officials at various levels and the party 
members to remember that people are the real heroes of history 
and work sincerely for their interest so as to promote 
development of socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. 
  Jiang Zemin, who is also chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, visited villages in mountain areas, some old 
revolutionary bases, schools, factories and military troops. 
  In Xingxian county, he said that New China was founded by 
the 
older revolutionary generation. The party and government should 
bear them in mind and uphold the revolutionary martyrs' spirit 
so as to revitalize the region of the old revolutionary bases. 
  He specially urged village leaders to take good care of the 
poor. 
  He said that as long as officials keep the poverty-stricken 
areas in mind and share the comforts and hardships of the 
masses, adhere to Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and to the party's basic line, the 
backward conditions in the poverty-stricken areas will be 
removed. 
  He said that China should make efforts to uproot poverty by 
the end of this century. Solution of the question of rights of 
subsistance of the Chinese people which account for one quarter 
of the world population is an important event not only in 
history of the Chinese nation but also in history of the whole 
human race. 
  He noted that the development of stability of the vast rural 
areas plays a vital role in the development and stability in the 
whole country and the whole of society. 
  He said that it is always an unswerving task to strengthen 
China's agricultural basis. He called for setting great store 
by grain, cotton and edible-oil production. 
  At Qiaoli village in Linfen city, Jiang talked with Wang 
Yunkang, secretary of a party branch of the village, and he 
spoke highly of his work in leading people to common wealth. 
  He said that the key question in the work of grass-root 
units 
in rural areas is to set up a competent party branch. 
  He said that the party committees and governments at all 
levels should enhance construction of leaderships and improve 
working style. 
  Accompanied by Hu Fuguo, secretary of Shanxi Provincial 
party 
committee, and Sun Wensheng, acting governor of Shanxi Province, 
Jiang inspected some capital projects for water and soil 
conservation, highways for transporting coal and an irrigation 
project on the Yellow River. 
  He said that in construction of some projects, volunteer 
labor programs should be advocated among officials and workers 
of all trades. 
  He said: "That is the concrete display of stressing 
socialist politics and the party's fine tradition." 
  On the question of state-owned enterprises, Jiang said that 
in the development of the socialist market economy, the strength 
of state-owned enterprises should be enhanced. 
  He called on the enterprises carefully to control the assets 
and properties of the state, and further to transform management 
systems, to regulate industrial set-ups and establish a modern 
enterprise system. 
  In his tour, Jiang Zemin paid special attention to rural 
education, especially the schooling conditions in mountain 
areas. Whenever he arrived at a village, he went to see 
kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, and he 
affirmed Shanxi's progress in carrying out the hope project to 
help the drop-outs return to school in poverty-stricken areas. 
  He reiterated that in the final analysis, economic and 
social 
development in China depend on the quality of Chinese people and 
the development level of science and culture. 
  He said that to ignore education is short-sighted and 
dangerous. 
  He urged the rural areas to develop education services so as 
to cultivate more talents at primary and secondary level for 
economic development in rural areas. 
  Jiang Zemin also invited some celebrated national model 
workers to attend a forum to listen to people's opinions and he 
went to visit some units of the People's Liberation Army.

(5012 0393): "When I Am No Longer Around, Will China Plunge

  [Text] Chinese people, as well as many foreigners, have 
for many years repeated to themselves a big question, which is 
now even more of a question as we enter the new year. 
<H3>  One of the Purposes of Deng's Trip to the South Is Therapy 
and Convalescence in the Winter Season </H3>
  Will Deng Xiaoping survive 1994? Once Deng is gone, will 
China plunge into great chaos? 
  Long ago, somebody predicted that Deng would not survive 
1993. Rumors that Deng Xiaoping had fallen ill began to 
circulate again at the end of 1993. I made a thorough 
investigation and provided CHENG MING's readers with the most 
up-to-date information: Deng took a special southbound train in 
Beijing on the evening of 9 December 1993. He arrived in Wuxi's 
Tai Hu on 11 December and went to stay in No. 2 Villa. The 
result of the follow-up investigation shows that Deng Xiaoping 
has survived 1993 safe and sound, mortifying some prophets. 
  The newsletter of the CPC Central Committee General Office 
dated 13 December 1993 reported part of Deng's itinerary: On 
the evening of 9 December, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, accompanied by 
the comrades in charge of the CPC Central Committee General 
Office, took a special train and went on a southward trip. On 
the way, he had cordial conversations with the persons in charge 
of local authorities in some provinces. Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
and some other old comrades will have a brief rest in Wuxi and 
later move on to Shanghai. Comrades Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, 
Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, and Zhang Wannian saw them off at the 
railway station. This "official report" agreed with the report 
in "Notes on a Northern Journey." As revealed by an informed 
source, one of the purposes of Deng Xiaoping's southern trip was 
to have a second round of therapy and convalescence after the 
Lao Shan holiday last April, this time in winter. The main 
objective was to improve his body functions and treat 
rheumatism. He arrived in Shanghai on 23 December and stayed at 
the lakeside of Dianshan Hu. 
<H3>  Deng Has Been Seeing Military VIPs the Most Since He Retired 
From the Political Foreground </H3>
  On 3 January, Deng Xiaoping met with and entertained 
military 
leaders at the lakeside of Dianshan Hu. The 5 January 
newsletter of the CPC Central Committee General Office said: In 
Shanghai, Comrade Deng Xiaoping met with persons in charge of 
the Central Military Commission and all services, arms, and 
military regions and gave a dinner for them. After the dinner, 
he had a cordial conversation with them. 
  In recent years, that is, since Deng retired from the 
political foreground, he has been seeing top military personnel 
the most. This is because Deng has a very firm concept that the 
military not only produces political power, but also protects 
political power; and that especially after he has passed away 
the military will have to be relied on to consolidate and 
preserve the leadership group with Jiang as the core and other 
undertakings he will leave behind. For fear that wavering, 
splitting, breakups, and rebellion may occur within the Army 
once the situation changes, besides setting up a group loyal to 
his cause and ideology to succeed him, he also considers 
reinforcing the Army's loyalty to the CPC Central Committee and 
the core of the party as the second most important matter. An 
inside story reveals that at the 3 January meeting, Deng 
Xiaoping made an emphatic speech on the question of whether or 
not China will suffer disturbances after the old generation of 
leaders is gone. What concerns people most is this question: 
"Once Deng dies, will China plunge into great chaos?" Now Deng 
Xiaoping is answering his own question. 
<H5>  "It Is Possible That Partial Disturbances May Happen" </H5>
  According to the minutes of the National Defense University 
party committee meeting at which Zhao Nanqi relayed Deng's 
remarks, the content of Deng's speech, disjointedly delivered, 
is as follows. 
  There is one question that other countries, including those 
friendly to our country, have been concerned with for nearly 10 
years. The question is whether or not China will plunge into 
chaos when our generation is gone, when I am also gone. Of 
course there are some countries hoping China will have great 
chaos, such as a civil war. Foreign hostile forces also hope 
that China will have great chaos. Also, the hostile elements 
within and outside China wish great chaos on China, the more 
chaotic the better. I would like to tell these countries to 
stop being idealistic and dreaming about it. 
  As long as the party's and the state's line and principles 
are correct; their policies conform to the interests of the 
broad masses; the party and government leadership groups have 
rallying power and enjoy public support; and the party and the 
people maintain close ties and the people rally around the party 
center, then China will not have drastic changes or big 
disturbances. 
  However, it is possible that some inappropriate policy may 
cause partial disturbances, but we can redress it in time. It 
is also possible that some people may try to make trouble in 
China with support from foreign countries and hostile forces. 
If that happens, it should be handled in good time without 
procrastination. 
  Foreign countries and hostile forces have never stopped 
trying to make trouble in China. We should not expect hostile 
political forces to restrain themselves and let us carry on with 
our four modernizations peacefully. 
  It is correct for the leadership group of our Army to have 
such an awareness. This is in keeping with the objective 
situation. 
  Why are hegemonists and the anti-China and anticommunist 
forces hostile to, and afraid of, the People's Liberation Army 
[PLA]? Why are foreign hostile forces and domestic hostile 
elements afraid of, and why do they attack, the PLA? Because 
the interests of our Army completely coincide with the interests 
of the party, the people, and the state. Our Army is the 
people's Army led by the party. 
<H5>  Deng Mentions Two Possible Causes of Turmoil </H5>
  Though many people in and outside China are certain that 
there must be great chaos or even a civil war after Deng 
Xiaoping dies, Deng himself has "prevailed over all dissenting 
views." As to whether or not he is logical or convincing enough 
to wipe out people's misgivings, people have to think it over 
and make their own judgments. However, while ruling out the 
possibility of great chaos, he did not rule out the possibility 
of minor turmoil. In the two possibilities mentioned above, the 
first obviously refers to the type of "turmoil" in the 1989 
pro-democracy movement. To tackle such "turmoil," Deng did not 
mention deploying the Army or tanks, but made this light remark: 
"But we can redress it in time." Does this mean he has drawn a 
lesson from the 4 June massacre, or does it mean he sees armed 
suppression as something that naturally has to be done? The 
first possibility and the second possibility are the two sides 
of one coin: Though turmoil is caused by inappropriate 
policies, there is also interference from outside. Deng 
believes this should be handled in good time. Does this remark 
smell of any gunpowder? Was the bloody suppression in the 4 
June incident a case of "timely handling?" If not, does "timely 
handling" mean solving "disturbances" or "trouble" before they 
happen through peaceful means? 
<H5>  Deng Is Laden With Anxieties About the Stability of the Army </H5>
  Deng Xiaoping often stresses that the pace of the economic 
reform, which is actually a semi-reform, should be quickened, 
but discourages fast reform of the Army structure. He told the 
military VIPs that though the pace of the military structural 
reform is a bit slow, it is quite stable and this is the right 
thing to do. Deng said: The Army is always a unique 
organization which cannot afford to have turmoil or ups and 
downs. The cadre contingent of the Army, mainly the leading 
bodies and leadership groups at or above the regiment level, 
should be streamlined. Some comrades have suggested that we 
wait until the issue is more thoroughly deliberated and the 
thinking at different levels is more aligned, so that problems 
are easier to solve. I agree with Huaqing and the General Staff 
Headquarters. The purpose of the reform is to greatly improve 
the quality of the Army, raise efficiency, improve the knowledge 
of science and technology and culture, and enhance fighting 
capabilities. The reform is now under way in the Air Force, 
some of the group armies, and the East China Sea Fleet. It is 
making smooth progress, but we should keep watch on the changing 
circumstances. 
  This remark by Deng Xiaoping indicates that contrary to his 
lightheartedness toward the "partial disturbances" outside the 
Army, he is laden with anxieties about whether or not the Army 
can maintain long-term stability. Therefore, while not 
demanding a quickened pace of Army reform, he is worried that 
problems may emerge in some units where the reform is going on 
and "making smooth progress." 
<H5>  "The Problems in the Army Are Rather Outstanding" </H5>
  Deng Xiaoping also said: It is correct for us to practice 
omnidimensional reform and socialist market economy, but we 
should be soberly aware that some decadent things from 
capitalism have infiltrated our Army. The problems in the Army 
are rather outstanding, though there has been a turn for the 
better lately. The crux of the issue is that the Army must 
strengthen party building, which will in turn contribute to the 
Army building. The Army should have its own characteristics and 
should consistently adhere to "four qualities (lofty ideals, 
moral integrity, education, and physical strength), three 
emphases (appearance and bearing, courtesy, and a sense of 
discipline), and two undauntednesses (undaunted by difficulties 
and hardships and undaunted by the need to sacrifice one's 
life)." It was correct of the Central Military Commission to 
criticize some Army cadres for being preoccupied with their 
personal benefits, sulking, and affecting morale. The problem 
is that we should get our thinking straightened out, truly 
straightened out. This will make the job easier and more 
effective. 
  Those two remarks by Deng Xiaoping indicate that the CPC's 
Army is not a great wall of steel. There are many old and new 
problems in the Army that must be solved through reform. But 
reform will aggravate instability. Furthermore, the Army's 
trust in the party, the party center, and the party leaders has 
been shaken and it is very unhappy about the party's corruption 
and all kinds of problems caused by corruption. In this way, 
the Army's rallying power and fighting capabilities are bound to 
decline. Even Army cadres are "preoccupied with their personal 
benefits, sulking, and affecting morale." Deng demanded 
"straightening out the thinking" in the Army. But how can it be 
done? 
<H3>  The 2d Artillery Corps, the Commission for Science, 
Technology, and Industry for National Defense [CSTIND], and the 
Military Regions Demand More Expenditure </H3>
  According to military sources, in the middle of December 
1993, the 2d Artillery Corps, the CSTIND, and the military 
regions demanded more military expenditure and operating funds. 
The 2d Artillery Corps asked for a 150 percent increase, the 
CSTIND asked for an increase of 800 million yuan for scientific 
research and production (the Central Military Commission having 
granted 420 million yuan), and institutions of higher military 
education demanded increases in operating funds of more than 100 
percent (the Central Military Commission having granted 30 to 60 
percent increases). 
  At the National Defense Ministry's committee meeting in 
January, Chi Haotian announced that the State Council and the 
Central Military Commission had, after examination and 
deliberation, granted a 12.5 percent increase (with the 
inflation rate deducted) in the military and national defense 
funds for 1994. The budget for 1995 is set at a 15.8 percent 
increase over 1993, while the military is asking for a 35 
percent increase. 
  Can Deng properly solve all these practical problems in the 
Army? 
<H3>  Deng Feels Anxious About the Destiny of the Country After 
His Death </H3>
  Deng Xiaoping has survived 1993. Many people hope he can 
survive 1994. But he can see that the end of his life is not 
far off. He keeps persuading the top-echelon military leaders, 
pacifying them, asking them not to be pessimistic about the 
situation after his death, and asking them to stabilize the 
general sentiment in the Army and raise the morale of the 
troops. All this shows that this old man is still very anxious 
about the destiny of the country after his death. This is what 
is tragic about this chief architect of the "quarter-reform."

<F P=106> [Article by Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524) and Xu </F>
Zhengzhong (6079 2973 0022): "A Year Crucial to China's 
Reform--Prospects for Economic Restructuring in 1994"] 
  [Text] The year 1994 will be crucial to achieving overall 
progress while making key breakthroughs in China's economic 
restructuring. At the beginning of this year, when we look 
ahead, we have every reason to believe that great successes in 
reform will definitely be achieved in the new year. 
  As everyone knows, the theme of reform in the 1980's was to 
smash the old system, which was a project of "demolishing the 
old house," whereas the major task of reform in the future is to 
set up a new system, which is a project of "constructing a 
building." In a sense, the latter is even more difficult than 
the former because reform today has begun to shift from a 
shallow level to a deep level and from achieving successes in 
single areas to making overall progress. 
  Reform at a deep level determines that we have to undertake 
arduous tasks. 
  So, in 1994, what kind of reform tasks are we going to face? 
According to officials of the State Commission for Restructuring 
Economy, following a long period of repeated deliberations, 
studies, and estimates, in the new year reform will be deepened 
and breakthroughs will be made in many fields, including 
taxation; finance; investment; the foreign trade system; social 
security; the housing system; the civil service system; the wage 
system of executive organs, institutions, and units; and price 
reform. 
  There are two foci in these numerous reforms: Efforts will 
be made to transform the state-owned enterprise operating 
mechanism and to make innovations in the enterprise system and, 
at the same time, to speed up reforms in the taxation, finance, 
planning, and investment systems and to make important strides 
forward in establishing a macroscopic regulation system in line 
with the requirements of the market economy. 
  To fulfill these arduous tasks in reform, we must ultimately 
achieve three goals: 1) We must establish a modern enterprise 
system which meets the requirements of the market economy and in 
which the property rights as well as the rights and 
responsibilities of enterprises are clearly defined, government 
administration and enterprise management are separated, and 
scientific management is established; 2) With emphasis on 
developing the market of factors of production, we must develop 
a unified, open, competitive, and orderly market system; 3) We 
must study and establish a positive and effective system of 
state macroscopic regulation and policies as well as a whole set 
of national economic statistical indexes and laws and 
regulations so as to maintain a basic equilibrium of total 
supply and demand, to help optimize the economic structure, and 
to lead to sustained and healthy development of the national 
economy. 
  Experts generally hold that to fulfill these tasks and 
achieve the set reform goals, we must uphold the reform strategy 
of making overall progress in a coordinated manner. We must not 
only carry out a comprehensive design of reform from a 
coordinated angle but also consider the arrangement of each and 
every reform measure from a comprehensive angle. 
  The reform in 1994, which touches a wide range of areas, is 
a 
complicated and formidable systematic project. Reform which is 
carried out in a wide scope at a deep level involves the 
readjustment of the pattern of power and interests on all sides. 
Hence, to fulfill these tasks, we must on the one hand be fully 
confident of victory, but on the other hand we must be 
psychologically prepared for difficulties which may arise, 
insist on scientific design, work prudently, sum up the 
situation promptly, and avoid making big mistakes. 
  The conditions are favorable. First, our party constantly 
clarifies the orientation and objectives of reform and perfects 
theories of reform, thus creating a favorable political 
environment; second, 15 years of reform and opening up have 
enabled millions of people to more consciously take part in this 
great practice, thus creating a more favorable social 
environment and public opinion. In addition, as the people's 
living standard is being improved day by day and they are in hot 
pursuit of new systems and things, all these factors also 
strengthen their perseverance in reform, thus creating a better 
environment of psychological acceptance. 
  We have nowhere to retreat. The establishment of a socialist 
market economic system is a pioneering undertaking unprecedented 
in human history, and we are required to accomplish this great 
cause with unprecedented courage. We are full of hope in the 
new year and toward the future.

  [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
has no right to make irresponsible remarks about the internal 
affairs of China, or of any other country, Chinese Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said here today. 
  Asked to comment, at the ministry's weekly news conference, 
on the human rights report issued by the U.S. State Department 
which criticized the human rights situation in China, Wu said: 
"It is utterly unreasonable and totally irresponsible for the 
so-called human rights report to distort, criticize and attack 
the domestic situation in China." 
  The U.S. State Department released the report on February 1. 
  "The issue of human rights falls in essence within the 
sovereignty of each country, which is embodied in its domestic 
legislations," Wu said. 
  "China's constitution and relevant laws have fully 
guaranteed 
the Chinese people of all nationalities of every democratic 
right," said the spokesman, adding that the report had turned a 
blind eye to this fact. 
  "We are resolutely opposed to interference in our internal 
affairs under the excuse of human rights," Wu said.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 3 (AFP)--China slammed Thursday a U.S. 
State Department report that criticised Beijing's human rights 
record, labelling it "utterly unreasonable" and a gross 
distortion of the facts. 
  China's constitution guarantees its citizens every 
democratic 
right and it is "utterly unreasonable and totally irresponsible 
for the so-called human rights report ... to turn a blind eye to 
that fact," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly 
press briefing. 
  The U.S. report, published February 1, said that while China 
had made limited progress on human rights last year, it had 
still engaged in extrajudicial killings, torture and other 
abuses. 
  The report aimed to "distort, criticise and attack the 
domestic situation in China," Wu said, adding that the United 
States has no right "to make irresponsible remarks" about the 
internal affairs of China or any other country. 
  The publication of the U.S. report came as China and the 
United States are continuing negtiations on renewal of China's 
most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status, which Washington has 
made conditional on significant progress in human rights.

  [Excerpts] Beijing, Feb 3 (AFP)--China slammed Thursday a 
US State Department report that criticised Beijing's human 
rights record, labelling it "utterly unreasonable" and a gross 
distortion of the facts. [passage omitted] 
  The publication of the report and China's aggressive 
response 
is sure to further hamper Sino-U.S. negotiations over 
Washington's renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) 
trading status, which President Bill Clinton has tied to 
significant progress in human rights. 
  [Foreign Ministry spokesman] Wu also accused Washington of 
using the human rights issue to undermine China's sovereign 
rights, reiterating that Beijing is "resolutely opposed to 
interference in our internal affairs under the excuse of human 
rights." In a clear reference to the detention of political 
prisoners, Wu stressed that the functioning of China's judiciary 
"is something that the Chinese government cannot interfere in, 
let alone any foreign forces." 
  "It is not appropriate to mix human rights issues and legal 
issues," he added. 
  The U.S. report said China had released some prominent 
political dissidents, but continued to hold hundreds and perhaps 
thousands more, and often engaged in torture in prisons, 
especially in sensitive regions such as Tibet. "Fundamental 
human rights provided for in the Chinese Constitution frequently 
are ignored in practice, and challenges to the Communist Party's 
political authority are often dealt with harshly and 
arbitrarily," the report said. [passage omitted] 
  Asked if China was willing to make gestures in the human 
rights area in order to make it easier for Clinton to recommend 
MFN renewal, Wu simply reiterated the government's position of 
holding dialogue with other countries "on the basis of equality 
and mutual respect."

  [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Maintaining 
Sino-British cooperation on the Hong Kong issue is in the 
interest of both China and Britain, a Chinese spokesman said 
here today. 
  Wu Jianmin, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said this at a 
routine news conference this afternoon, when asked to comment on 
former British Ambassador to China Sir Percy Cradock's criticism 
of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten in an article carried by the 
"SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST". 
  Wu said that China has noticed that there are different 
voices within Britain over the Hong Kong issue. 
  He noted that to maintain cooperation between China and 
Britain on the matter of Hong Kong is in accordance with the 
interests of the two sides. 
  He said that Patten's intransigence and uncooperative 
attitude would end up harming Britain's own interests. 
  Cradock was ambassador to China from June 1978 to December 
1983. 
  On China's reaction toward the recently tabled fourth 
funding 
plan for the construction of the new Hong Kong airport, Wu said 
that the Chinese Government had just received the new financial 
arrangement plan from the British side and was studying it 
earnestly. 
  He said that the new airport issue should be settled in 
accordance with the memorandum of understanding reached between 
China and Britain. 
  In the process of such settlement, the British side should 
demonstrate its sincerity, Wu said, adding that the Chinese side 
has already demonstrated a lot of sincerity over the Hong Kong 
matter.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 3 (AFP)--China is "earnestly studying" 
Britain's latest financing proposals for Hong Kong's new airport 
project, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said Thursday. 
  Britain formally submitted the proposals to China on 
Wednesday. Progress on the 20.3 billion dollar airport project 
is threatened by the lack of agreement--called for by a 1991 
Sino-British pact--on how to pay for what is one of the world's 
biggest public works' undertakings. "China just received the 
new financial plan for airport... and is earnestly studying 
it," Wu told a weekly press briefing. 
  Britain has been pressing for a prompt meeting of the 
group's 
airport committee, which last convened in April, to resolve the 
financing issue. 
  The latest British proposal--approved Tuesday by Governor 
Chris Patten's cabinet--reportedly increases to more than 60 
billion Hong Kong dollars (7.76 billion U.S.) the equity to be 
injected into the venture. 
  China wants Hong Kong to dig deeper into its growing 
reserves 
to pay for the airport, due to be finished in 1997 when the 
colony reverts to China, while Patten's administration favours a 
greater degree of debt financing. Wu also reiterated that 
Patten's "intransigence and uncooperative attitude" in the row 
over his proposals to extend democracy in Hong Kong prior to 
1997 "will end up harming Britain's interests." 
  China has repeatedly warned that Sino-British trade ties 
will 
be affected unless Patten withdraws the package of reforms he 
submitted to the territory's Legislative Council in December, 
amid angry protests from Beijing.

  [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government welcomes the decision of the United States to lift 
the trade embargo on Vietnam since the improvement of 
U.S.-Vietnamese ties will benefit the stability and prosperity 
of the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said this at a 
weekly press conference here this afternoon while commenting on 
recent reports that the United States will lift the embargo very 
soon. 
  The embargo was imposed about two decades ago. 
  Wu also said that Sino-Vietnamese relations in various 
fields 
are developing smoothly.

  [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government firmly opposes any form of official contact between 
Taiwan and countries that have diplomatic relations with China, 
said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman here today. 
  Wu Jianmin, the spokesman, reiterated the official stand of 
the Chinese Government at a weekly press conference here this 
afternoon. 
  When asked to comment on a report that the Taiwan 
authorities 
have sent officials on a secret visit to Hong Kong and Macao to 
hold consultations with the Hong Kong and Macao Governments on 
matters concerning air services, he said that air routes between 
Taiwan and Hong Kong and between Taiwan and Macao are those 
between three places with China's territory. 
  Prior to 1997 and 1999, Britain and Portugal are responsible 
for the administration of Hong Kong and Macao respectively, Wu 
said. 
  During the transitional period, he added, if an airliner of 
Hong Kong or Macao wishes to enter into a non-governmental 
arrangement straddling 1997 or 1999 with an airliner of Taiwan 
on air services between them, the British side or the Portuguese 
side should consult the Chinese Government in advance.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Feb 3 (AFP)--North Korean leader Kim 
Il-sung has responded to a secret message from U.S. President 
Bill Clinton on how to ease the crisis over the Korean 
peninsula, U.S. evangelist Billy Graham said Thursday. 
  "President Kim gave me a message to give to President 
Clinton. It will be in his hands tomorrow (Friday) morning," 
said Graham, talking for the first time about his trip last week 
to Pyongyang. 
  The message was being carried to Washington by one of 
Graham's aides. 
  The globe-travelling preacher, who arrived in Pyongyang last 
Thursday for his second visit in as many years, said he was "not 
free" to say what was in either message. 
  But he revealed that Kim was "very interested" in what 
Clinton had asked Graham to convey to him. 
  Graham, 75, said he discussed a wide range of subjects over 
lunch with Kim, 81, whose Stalinist state is suspected of 
developing nuclear weapons, upsetting East Asia's strategic 
balance. 
  "He appeared to be vigorous and in good health. My strong 
impression was that he continues to be the dominant figure in 
North Korean political and social life," he said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xu Changyin (1776 7022 6892)] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 3 Feb [XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Clinton today announced at the White House that the United 
States has decided to lift its 19-year-old trade embargo against 
Vietnam. 
  Clinton said: Over the past year, with Vietnam's 
cooperation, the United States has made "major and substantial 
progress" [zhong da de shi zhi xing jin zhan 6850 1129 4104 1395 
6347 1840 6651 1455] in finding American MIAs from the Vietnam 
war. Therefore, the best way to ensure Vietnam's continued 
cooperation is to "end the trade embargo" against Vietnam. He 
said the United States will continue to work to find out the 
whereabouts of those American servicemen who are still missing. 
  Before Clinton made the announcement, he discussed the 
matter 
with family members of some American MIAs. Some American 
Vietnam war veterans organizations and family members of MIAs 
had asked President Clinton not to lift the trade embargo before 
the whereabouts of all American MIAs are known. 
  Clinton also announced that he has decided to establish a 
liaison office in Vietnam to "provide services for Americans" in 
Vietnam and to "help us to pursue a human rights dialogue with 
the Vietnamese Government." But, he expressly pointed out that 
"these actions do not constitute a normalization of our 
relationships." Before our relations can be normalized, "we 
must have more progress, more cooperation, and more answers." 
To achieve this goal, Clinton said he will "send another 
high-level U.S. delegation to Vietnam" "this spring." 
  Clinton's announcement of lifting the trade embargo against 
Vietnam immediately met with welcome from U.S. enterprise 
circles. Some people from U.S. enterprise circles have held that 
Vietnam is a new hot market and said Clinton's decision will 
open up a new channel for U.S. exports and investment.

  [Text] Washington, February 3 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton announced today the lifting of the 19-year-old 
trade embargo against Vietnam. 
  "I am absolutely convinced it offers the best way to resolve 
the fate of those who remain missing and about whom we are not 
sure," Clinton said at the White House. 
  Clinton said Vietnam has made "significant tangible 
progress" 
in helping resolve the issue of POWs and MIAs in the Vietnam war. 
  Clinton made the announcement after meeting with 
representatives of the families of soldiers still missing. 
  Two U.S. veterans' groups had urged Clinton not to lift the 
embargo until all American servicemen missing since the war have 
been accounted for. 
  The President vowed that he remains personally "committed to 
continuing the search for the answers and the peace of mind that 
the families of the missing deserve." 
  "I have carefully considered the questions of how best to 
sustain that cooperation in securing the fullest possible 
accounting," Clinton said. 
  "I have consulted with my national security and veterans' 
affairs advisers," he added, "it was their view that the key to 
continued progress lies in expanding our contacts with Vietnam." 
  "I have made the judgment that the best way to ensure 
cooperation from Vietnam and to continue getting the information 
Americans want on POWs and MIAs is to end the trade embargo," 
Clinton said. 
  The President also announced that he has decided to 
establish 
a liaison office in Vietnam to "provide services for Americans 
there and help us to pursue a human rights dialogue with the 
Vietnamese Government." 
  But Clinton made clear that "these actions do not constitute 
a normalization of our relationships." 
  "Before that happens," the president stressed, "we must have 
more progress, more cooperation, and more answers."

  [Text] United Nations, February 3 (XINHUA) -- China 
attaches great importance to the work of social development and 
has all along adhered to the principle of combining economic 
construction and social development, the top Chinese UN envoy 
said today. 
  Speaking at the first meeting of the preparatory committee 
for the World Summit for Social Development, Li Zhaoxing, 
Chinese permanent representative to UN, said China will make 
full use of the good conditions created by the economic growth, 
pay attention to new problems and make the society more 
civilized, equatable, healthy and happy. 
  The convocation of the world summit, in 1955 in Copenhagen, 
reflects not only the importance attached to the issue of 
development by the United Nations and its member states, but 
also the common aspiration of jointly facing the future by 
entire mankind, Li said. 
  With the view of achieving more practical and desired 
results 
at the summit, he made five observations: 
  -- Economic development cannot automatically promote social 
progress. In an ideal and healthy society, there should be a 
coordinated development in economic and social fields, and the 
economic achievements should be applied to social development in 
a timely and appropriate manner. 
  -- The promotion and enhancement of social development is a 
fairly strong government action. The coordination between 
economic and social development, between departments within the 
field of social development, between regions and between 
government and non-governmental organizations all depend on the 
comprehensive coordination and management of the government. 
  -- The declaration and program of action to be adopted by 
the 
summit should give special attention to the grave problems faced 
by the developing countries, and international cooperation 
should be conducted in a comprehensive, effective and fair 
manner and on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. 
  -- The establishment and maintenance of a peaceful and 
stable 
international environment and the establishment of a new 
international economic order of justice, equality mutual benefit 
and cooperation, should be a precondition for the settlement of 
social problems in various countries. 
  -- Since countries have different development level, social 
system and cultural tradition, their emphasis on questions in 
social development vies, specific policies, approaches and 
programs of action should be formulated in line with different 
national conditions. 
  The Chinese ambassador also told the meeting that his 
government is planning to hold a national conference on social 
development, the first of its kind in China, in September to 
review the program for social development in China for the next 
few decades. 
  China is also planning to hold in Beijing an international 
symposium on social development in June to discuss such issues 
as social development and social progress and role of the 
government in social development. 
  China's preparatory committee for the summit, chaired by the 
head of the State Planning Commission and composes of 25 
officials at the ministerial level from central departments and 
leaders of non-governmental organizations, was established last 
December.

  [Text] Geneva, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Yishan, 
alternate representative of Chinese delegation, spoke here 
Thursday [3 February] on the right of peoples to 
self-determination at the 50th session of the Commission on 
Human Rights. The following is the excerpt of his statement: 
  "The right of peoples to self-determination has been 
universally recognized as the most fundamental prerequisite to 
the enjoyment of all human right and fundamental freedom. 
  "Respect for the right of peoples to self-determination 
means, first and foremost, opposing any foreign aggression, 
interference and domination, safeguarding independence, 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, and ensuring 
the people of each country to freely determine their political 
status, social system and economic development model. This is a 
basic guarantee to a country's survival and the precondition for 
the people of each country to fully enjoy their human rights and 
fundamental freedom. 
  "The right of peoples to self-determination is applicable to 
peoples who are under foreign or colonial domination and foreign 
occupation. It must not be used as a pretext for supporting 
aggression or infringing upon the territorial integrity, 
sovereignty and political independence of any state. 
  "The Vienna declaration and program of action adopted by the 
World Conference on Human Rights last year clearly points out 
that the realization of the peoples to self-determination shall 
not be construed as authorizing or encouraging any action which 
would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial 
integrity or political unity or sovereign and independent 
states. [sentence as received] 
  "The 48th session of the UN General Assembly, in its 
recently 
adopted resolutions, reaffirms the right of peoples to 
self-determination, and the legitimacy of the struggle of people 
for independence, territorial integrity and national unity. 
  "To strictly abide by these principles in today's 
international relations has an important and practical 
significance. Some events happened in certain parts of the 
world have shown that any distorted interpretation and 
application of the principle of self-determination, will only 
lead to or exacerbate ethnic conflict and social upheaval, or 
even result in a civil war or regional conflict, thereby posing 
a grave threat to world peace and security. 
  "How to deal with the right of peoples to self-determination 
has become a question of serious concern to the international 
community. The Chinese delegation has always maintained that the 
international community must uphold the original meaning of this 
right and should implement in earnest the principles set out in 
the UN Charter and a series of international instruments and UN 
resolutions in this regard."

"Old Problems, New Measures--Three Major Tasks Confronting the 
Clinton Administration"] 
  [Text] Washington, 1 Feb (RENMIN RIBAO)--U.S. President 
Bill Clinton delivered his State of the Union address to a joint 
session of the Senate and House of Representatives on 25 
January, and proposed that medical insurance reform, social 
welfare reform, and the anticrime campaign should continue to be 
the first duties for the government this year. Public opinion 
held that the three issues mentioned above have been unresolved 
problems for years in the United States, as well as old problems 
which Clinton had wished to solve but has not yet solved. 
  For a long period of time medical and health expense in the 
United States has been increasing year after year, so has the 
number of those not covered by medical insurance. In fiscal 
1993, the nation's expense in this area exceeded $900 billion, 
which accounted for 14.6 percent of the GDP, up from 9.6 percent 
in 1981. Last September, Clinton proposed a reform plan to 
Congress, suggesting insurance for the whole people with costs 
to be shared by the state, enterprises, and individuals. Since 
announcement of the plan, most people have expressed support for 
its general goal, but responded differently to the concrete 
measures. Some medical and health insurance companies and some 
pharmaceutical factories are not happy with the possible loss of 
income due to the reform; small enterprises which in the past 
seldom or never provided insurance for their employees, have 
expressed grievances against the government's demand that they 
provide their employees with a large portion of insurance 
premium. In Congress, the Republicans argued that the plan 
allows too much government intervention, involves too much 
money, and leads to a tax increase. Among the Democrats there 
are also those who are opposed to the plan, and they say the 
plan makes small enterprises pay a lot of expense to the extent 
of affecting employment. Clinton pointed out in his State of 
the Union address that no matter what kind of plan, it has to 
guarantee insurance for the whole people, otherwise, he will 
exercise a presidential veto on the adopted bill. 
  Clinton's intention in reforming the current social welfare 
system is: Lightening the load of government and changing the 
burden into a motive force. According to the current social 
welfare system in the United States, apart from providing 
low-income families with medical subsides and the aged and 
disabled with medical care, the government also has to provide 
$350-400 of relief money to the poor families which have 
juvenile children, as well as food coupons of $70 to each of the 
destitute every month. At present, some 5 million families in 
the country are claiming relief money, and about 27 million 
people are receiving food coupons. These two "contingents" are 
still growing in strength, the government's expense has 
increased year after year, and currently the annual expense on 
relief money and food coupons has reached $45 billion. Clinton 
thinks that this growing burden not only affects the effort to 
cut the deficit, but is also harmful to economic development. 
  Clinton announced in his State of the Union address that in 
the spring of this year, he will submit to Congress an overall 
plan of reform of the social welfare system. According to 
information, the plan mainly includes: Poor people who have 
ability to work will only be provided with relief money for two 
years; free training will be provided to those who have no job 
skills or have low educational attainment; baby sitting 
allowances will be provided to the women who have young 
children; the government will allocate funds to open service 
industries, to provide job opportunities to the above-mentioned 
people; and efforts will be made to encourage private 
enterprises to arrange jobs for the above-mentioned people. The 
plan will enable 1.5 million to 2 million adults (mostly single 
mothers who have juvenile children) to eventually part with 
government relief. Most people think that Clinton's move is in 
the right direction, but they are skeptical about a swift 
solution of this difficult problem which has existed for years. 
  Crime, especially violent crime, is an old problem causing 
the most terrible headache for those within and outside the 
government in the United States. From 1980 to 1992, the number 
of violent crimes in the United States increased 27 percent, and 
the number of those serving their terms in prisons increased 180 
percent. Last year, various kinds of violent incidents became 
more frequent, and murders and kidnappings became numerous. 
Clinton stressed repeatedly that the economic losses caused by 
crime in the United States reached $425 billion a year, in 
particular, crime increased medical expenses. Last year, the 
Clinton administration was able to urge Congress to pass the 
"Brady bill on control of firearms," and to allocate $50 million 
to boost police strength in some parts of the country. But in 
the face of violent crime, these two measures are obviously 
ineffective. Therefore, he once again stressed in his State of 
the Union address that it is necessary to pass more, tougher 
anticrime measures. He asked Congress to pass a bill which will 
make criminals have no guns in their hands, send those who 
commit serious crimes three times to life imprisonment, build 
more prisons, harshly punish drug-related crimes, and increase 
the police by 100,000 men. 
  Public opinion holds that for Clinton to achieve the 
above-mentioned goals, he will meet a great many difficulties. 
For example, regarding the problem of gun control, so long as 
selling and buying guns are not banned nationwide, it will be 
very difficult to ensure that criminals have no guns in their 
hands. In addition, "it takes more than one cold day for the 
river to freeze three feet deep," when the root cause of crime 
in the society is not removed, the measures to control crime are 
only tackling the symptoms but not the root cause. 
  President Clinton has proposed these new measures to deal 
with those old problems in the beginning of a new year. What 
will be the result? People are waiting to see.

  [Text] Washington, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Senate, 
acting with unusual speed, confirmed tonight William Perry as 
the new U.S. defense secretary, succeeding Les Aspin who 
announced his resignation last December 18. 
  The vote of 97-0 this evening came slightly more than a week 
after President Clinton named Perry, the No. 2 man at the 
Pentagon. Shortly after the Senate vote, Perry was sworn in at 
the Pentagon. 
  Perry was born in Vandergrift, Pa., on October 11, 1927. He 
interrupted his education to serve in the Army in 1946-1947, 
specializing in artillery. He graduated from Stanford with a 
degree in mathematics in 1949. 
  He went on to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics from Pennsylvania 
State University in 1957 and taught at the school during the 
1950s as a professor of engineering. 
  Perry returned to California in 1964 to head ESL Inc., a 
military electronics company, which he left in 1977 to become 
the Pentagon's under secretary for research and development 
under President Carter. 
  After Carter left office, Perry joined an investment banking 
firm in San Francisco and then served as chairman of Technology 
Strategies and Alliance, a consulting firm based in Menlo Park, 
California. 
  In 1989, Perry became a director of the Center for 
International Security and Arms Control at Stanford, where he 
first worked with Russians seeking to convert from military to 
civilian production. 
  He was a member of the President's Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board and a member of a Technology Review Panel under 
the Senate Committee on Intelligence. 
  Perry has kept a low profile on some of the social issues 
that have troubled the Pentagon in the past year, but when asked 
at his confirmation hearing about homosexuals in the military 
and women in combat roles, Perry said that "people ought to be 
allowed to do any military service they are capable of doing." 
  Crises are still emerging despite the end of the Cold War, 
he 
said. 
  Perry leaves Friday [4 February] for a conference in Munich 
on defense issues.

  [Text] Moscow, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin today applauded the Russian-Georgian treaty of 
friendship and cooperation, saying that it paved the way for the 
further development of bilateral ties. 
  However, the lower house of the Russian parliament expressed 
its worry that the treaty would destabilize the Caucasian region. 
  Yeltsin arrived in the Georgian capital Tbilisi on Thursday 
[3 February] for a one-day visit which resulted in the signing 
of a treaty of friendship, good-neighborly relations and 
cooperation. 
  Under the treaty, Russia would help Georgia's armed forces 
by 
supplying them with military technology and equipment. 
  Yeltsin told a news conference in Tbilisi that Russia and 
Georgia should establish not only "friendship" but also "a union 
which would favor the interests of both countries," adding that 
the treaty would legally support bilateral relations. 
  But the treaty did not win support from the Russian 
lawmakers. The lower house of the parliament released a 
statement today in a news conference, saying that the treaty, 
especially the military aid item, would endanger the stability 
of the Caucasian region. 
  Yeltsin explained that the military aid would be carried out 
"gradually" and depends on the developing situation in Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia. 
  Abkhazia and South Ossetia are two autonomous regions of 
Georgia. They have been involved in bloody conflicts with 
Georgia after they declared independence from Tbilisi 
respectively in July 1992 and November 1991. 
  Leaders of the two regions also expressed their opposition 
to 
the treaty, stressing that such an agreement should be signed 
only after the conflict between Georgia and the two regions are 
completely settled and the latter's political status determined. 
  Yeltsin and his Georgian counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze 
agreed in their meeting that the conflicts should, nevertheless, 
be settled peacefully. 
  However, the lower house said that such a precondition might 
undermine the mediator status of Russia on the issue, arguing 
that Russia should consider its own interests first and protect 
itself from the threat of a wave of Caucasian refugees. 
  Ties between Russia and Georgia were tense in recent years 
due to the Abkhazia and South Ossetia issue and improved only 
after the Russian armed forces were allowed to be stationed in 
Georgia last October.

  [Text] Moscow, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Georgian leader 
Eduard Shevardnadze said on Thursday that his country is eager 
to settle its conflicts with breakaway Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia, according to reports reaching here. 
  Speaking at a joint news conference in Tbilisi, the capital 
of Georgia, together with visiting Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, Shevardnadze said, "a favorable influence of Russia" 
will enable Georgians "to resolve these problems very soon." 
  He described Georgia's conflicts with Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia as "most acute and most complicated," noting the 
Caucasian nation is interested "in the settlement more than 
anyone else because the country is now on the verge of hunger 
and poverty." 
  At the news conference, Yeltsin said, "Russia is proceeding 
from the need to respect Georgia's territorial integrity while 
fully honoring the interests of Abkhazia and South Ossetia." 
  "Russia is for the full-scale settlement of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian and Georgian-Ossetian conflicts by peaceful 
political means, as well as for the mutually acceptable solution 
of the problems relating to their state and political systems," 
the Russian president added. 
  Abkhazia, an autonomous republic of Georgia, declared its 
independence in July 1992, while South Ossetia, an autonomous 
region of the former Soviet republic, did that in November 1991. 
  As concerns the Russian troops deployed in Georgia, 
Shevardnadze told reporters that the two sides signed a protocol 
on Thursday morning to set up a working group to study 
thoroughly all aspects of the stationing of Russian troops in 
the former Soviet republic. 
  According to Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who is 
accompanying Yeltsin during the Georgian trip, both sides have 
reached agreement to create three military bases for Russian 
servicemen in Georgia. 
  The news conference followed a signing ceremony, in which 
leaders of the two nations signed 25 documents including the 
treaty of friendship, good-neighborly relations and cooperation. 
  Praising the treaty, Yeltsin said it laid down a "firm 
framework" for relations between Russia and Georgia. 
  Shevardnadze stressed that the treaty will "facilitate the 
strengthening of cooperation not only between our countries but 
among all members of the commonwealth of the independent states 
as a whole." 
  Yeltsin, who held a face-to-face summit talks with 
Shevardnadze right after his arrival and a welcoming ceremony, 
is scheduled to return to Moscow late Thursday evening. 
  Their talks and their ministers' negotiations held at the 
same time resulted in the package of accords on bilateral 
cooperation in the political, economic and military spheres.

(0242 0681 6511): "China and India Opened Four-Day Disarmament 
Talks in Katmandu Yesterday"] 
  [Text] Katmandu, 4 Feb (WEN WEI PO)--The four-day talks on 
disarmament along the Sino-Indian border, which has drawn the 
attention in various countries in the subcontinent of South 
Asia, will begin in New Delhi today. According to information, 
Fu Xuezhang, deputy director of the Department of Asian Affairs 
under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the chief Chinese 
negotiator, is accompanied by a number of military 
representatives. The mass media here used the headlines such as 
"two giants in Asia to cut troops along border and further 
improve ties to ensure peace," when reporting on the talks. 
  Last September in Beijing, the Chinese and Indian premiers 
signed the "agreement on maintaining peace and tranquility in 
the areas actually controlled by China and India along the 
border," and both sides agreed to cut troops along the border. 
  A border dispute existed between China and India for 30 
years, and a brief but fierce large-scale war broke out in 1962. 
It is generally believed that India currently deploys 60,000 
troops on the front. 
  Cheng Ruisheng, Chinese ambassador to India, stressed 
recently that "the conflict between China and India and the 
tense situation caused by it are now history." Both sides "are 
working hard to regain lost time, and relations are improving 
step by step." He said that "we should continue to maintain 
this pace." 
  Cheng Ruisheng also disclosed that Indian Vice President 
Narayanan will visit China this May.

  [Text] Beijing, February 3 ( XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said here today that 
it is in the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Pakistani 
peoples to further enhance their exchanges and cooperation in 
all fields. 
  It is also conducive to the peace, stability and development 
of South Asia and Asia as a whole, he added during a meeting 
with Wasim Sajjad, chairman of the Pakistan senate, and his 
party here this evening. 
  During the meeting, Li expressed his gratitude to the 
Pakistan senate, the Pakistan Government and people for the warm 
reception he received during his tour of Pakistan last December. 
  The frequent exchanges of visits between leaders of the two 
countries have pushed forward the friendship and friendly ties 
of cooperation between the two countries, Li said. 
  He expressed the belief that Sajjad's current visit would 
add 
new momentum to the development of bilateral ties. 
  The Sino-Pakistani friendship has a solid foundation, Li 
said. It has been fostered by the leaders of the old generation 
of the two countries, stood the test of time and been implanted 
in the hearts of the two peoples, he said. 
  No matter what happens, the Sino-Pakistani ties of 
cooperation will remain intact, Li said. 
  He noted that China is willing to further its exchanges and 
cooperation with Pakistan in economical, trade, scientific and 
technological fields and cultural endeavors. 
  The CPPCC and the Pakistan senate enjoy good ties, he said, 
adding that the contacts between them have been on the rise and 
played an important role in enhancing understanding, deepening 
friendship, widening contacts and promoting cooperation. 
  The CPPCC is ready to do more in this regard, he said. 
  Sajjad noted that the ties between his country and China 
have 
stood the test of time and that it is the cornerstone of his 
country's foreign policy to further strengthen and deepen its 
ties with China. 
  During the meeting, Sajjad also expressed thanks from the 
Pakistan Government and people for the help of the Chinese 
Government and people in furthering Pakistan's economic 
development. 
  After the meeting, Li hosted a dinner for the Pakistani 
visitors. 
  Qian Zhengying, CPPCC vice-chairperson, was present.

<F P=106> [From the "News at One" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The Trade Development Council 
[TDC] Executive Director Francis Lo says business in the region 
will benefit from the lifting of the embargo, and the profile of 
Hong Kong will be raised. 
  [Begin Francis Lo recording] I think that, with the 
international business community now focusing more and more on 
Asia, I think the normalization of trade relationship between 
United States and Vietnam will give this focus even further 
emphasis, and I think that would certainly be very good for Asia 
as a whole and very good for Hong Kong in particular, because 
Hong Kong is the operational base for a lot of international 
companies. It is the ideal marketing headquarters for these 
companies, and it is also a sourcing [as heard] center for any 
company wishing to buy products from this part of the world. I 
think it will actually reinforce Hong Kong's position as Asia's 
trade capital. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  The refugee coordinator, Brian Bresnahan, said the move by 
President Clinton would help Hong Kong solve the problem of 
Vietnamese boat people more quickly. 
  [Begin recording] [Bresnahan] I think that the lifting of 
the American trade embargo on Vietnam is good news for this 
particular problem. It will dash hopes amongst those screened 
out in our camps--and that is most of the population--that they 
might end up one day in America, they will then see more clearly 
that their only future is in Vietnam, and it will encourage them 
to go home. Certainly it is good news; it certainly enhances 
our chances of meeting a late 95-early 96 target of emptying our 
camps in Hong Kong. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you also think that it will have 
the effect of encouraging people who are now in Vietnam and 
might be considering coming to Hong Kong to stay there? 
  [Bresnahan] Absolutely, because of course, I mean, we have 
already said that the root of the boat people problem has always 
been in Vietnam and of course, many of the people who came here 
came because Vietnam was so poor. The lifting of the embargo 
will enhance economic activity in Vietnam and thus encourage 
people to stay where they are. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong's latest airport financing package "has 
directly addressed" concerns raised by China between June and 
August last year, according to sources close to the Chinese 
State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. 
  "The fourth package has comprehensively responded to our 
proposal," the source said. 
  Beijing still needed time to fully assess the implications 
of 
the new offer and it was unlikely the Sino-British Joint Liaison 
Group Airport Committee would resume talks in the next week or 
two. 
  Confirming that China had already received the new offer, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said the Chinese side was 
"studying it earnestly". 
  He reiterated that the issue of a new airport for Hong Kong 
should be settled in accordance with the Memorandum of 
Understanding and the British side should also demonstrate 
sincerity. 
  The Executive Council on Tuesday endorsed the new financing 
package that would see more than $60 billion [Hong Kong dollars] 
pumped into the Provisional Airport Authority and Mass Transit 
Railway Corporation to fund the airport and railway projects. 
  The new funding level would reduce the debts borne by the 
two 
corporations to about $20 billion. 
  The offer is a major concession from Britain, in that it has 
substantially increased the equity injection by $15 billion from 
the $45 billion ceiling proposed in the third financing plan 
last June. 
  According to the source, China has made a package of 
counter-proposals on the level of debts, government equity, the 
sale of land and the cost control mechanism between June and 
August. 
  These proposals call for lower debt, higher government 
funding and independent cost monitoring. 
  The source said that it was very unlikely that China would 
reach any conclusion on the fourth package in the next week or 
two. 
  "The whole financial arrangement is and has to be a package. 
We need time." 
  Sources said China had already made clear to the British 
side 
in June that it would agree to granting the lease of the 62 
hectares of land before 1997. 
  He also denied suggestions that China was firmly opposed to 
separating the sale of 62 hectares of land from the 50-hectare 
ceiling for land sale, stipulated under the Joint Declaration. 
  "As a matter of fact, the total amount of land granted each 
year, since 1984, had exceeded the 50-hectare ceiling," the 
source said. 
  The source, however, remained cautious over whether China 
would agree to the latest British proposal. 
  "We can't say the problems have all been settled . . . but 
what I can only say is that the present proposal is a direct 
reply to our suggestions." 
  China demanded the formation of an independent committee to 
monitor the costing of the project. 
  But Britain disagreed and suggested that the function of the 
airport consultative committee be strengthened to keep a closer 
watch on the building cost. 
  The source refused to say whether Britain had acceded to the 
Chinese demand for an independent cost monitoring body as part 
of the latest offer. 
  He added: "At least, they should spell out specifically ways 
to strengthen the role of the consultative committee." 
  Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang said yesterday that 
she believed the new financing proposal addressed concerns 
raised by the Chinese side. 
  "We believe that this proposal fully meets the concerns that 
the Chinese have expressed to us so far," Mrs Chan said. 
  However, she refused to disclose details. 
  "I do not think that it would assist us in getting early 
agreement from the Chinese on financing arrangements if I chose 
to discuss the details now," she said. 
  "We would very much wish the Chinese respond with an early 
meeting of the Airport Committee at which we can sensibly 
discuss these proposals." 
  But she added that the 62 hectares of land along the airport 
railway should be counted on top of the annual 50-hectare quota. 
  "We very much hope China can confirm the land along the rail 
link will be separately counted on the top of the annual quota," 
she said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Commenting on Another `Gift' After </F>
`Cleopatra's Dowry'"] 
  [Text] British Hong Kong held an Executive Council meeting 
on 1 February and announced afterwards that a fourth financial 
package for the new airport had been drafted. But Hong Kong 
people were kept in the dark, not knowing what kind of a package 
it was. Meanwhile, Chris Patten was boasting that the package 
was an "excellent Lunar New Year present" to the Hong Kong 
people and China. 
  Chris Patten is totally devoid of self-knowledge. He has 
exceeded his role and subverted the truth and has only succeeded 
in helping Hong Kong people to see his colonial mind set 
clearly. The British are not sending money to Hong Kong to 
build the new airport; it is being built by Hong Kong people's 
money earned with sweat and blood. In throwing away Hong Kong 
people's money, British Hong Kong is at the same time expanding 
expenditure on airport construction, almost doubling quotations 
for all projects, thus greatly increasing the burden on the Hong 
Kong people and debts for the SAR [special administrative 
region]. Not long ago, Chris Patten bragged that Britain would 
give China the "largest dowry since Cleopatra" when it pulled 
out of Hong Kong. Now he is again bragging that he is giving an 
"excellent New Year gift" to the Hong Kong people and China. 
How generous he is! But should one open his "dowry" and 
"gift," one would find nothing but a heavy financial burden. If 
it has to be described a "dowry" or a "gift," the beneficiary 
will be the British. It is an expensive "tribute" forcefully 
wrung from the Hong Kong people by the British. The Tsing Yi-Ma 
Wan crossing is a case in point. On the surface, it was an open 
bid. But the British rejected a HK$4.7-billion [Hong Kong 
dollars] bid from the Korean Hyundai Corporation's and awarded 
the project to a British consortium quoting HK$7.2 billion. 
Some HK$2 billion was unjustifiably spent in this way. Was 
this not the Hong Kong people's gift to the British 
colonialists? When Richard Allen of the Provisional Airport 
Authority had his employment contract terminated for spending 
money like water, he was given a golden handshake of some HK$5 
million, which indeed looked like "Cleopatra's" dowry. Every 
person in Hong Kong was distressed at being ripped off by 
British Hong Kong. But Chris Patten has the nerve to describe 
the fourth financial package as a "spring festival gift" to the 
people of Hong Kong and China. Is this not utter nonsense? He 
is only appropriating a little more from the financial surplus 
for the construction of the airport. Hong Kong people are still 
footing the bill, and costs have not come down either. How can 
this be described as "Chris Patten giving a gift?" 
  In fact, in mid-July 1991, China and Britain signed the 
Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport [MOU]. If 
Britain had not deliberately discarded the MOU to draft 
financial packages which created a bottomless pit of "callable 
equity" (HK$45 billion by now), deviated from the provisions of 
Annex III of the Joint Declaration, which states that China and 
Britain share equally the proceeds from the annual sale of 50 
hectares of land approved by the Land Commission, and had not 
made the improper demand that all revenues from property 
developments above the 62-hectare [area of land for development] 
railroad line should go to Britain, agreement on a financial 
package would have been reached long ago and many projects 
launched already. It is British Hong Kong which has been 
stalling, turning the situation into a stalemate, and 
deliberately creating obstacles. British Hong Kong should be 
responsible for the consequences which have resulted from its 
opposition to the MOU and the first three financial packages in 
the Joint Declaration. Chris Patten is describing the fourth 
financial package as a "spring festival gift," but the Hong Kong 
people will not be deceived again. Who will accept confusing the 
agenda, stalling, and quoting unjustifiably high prices as the 
bestowal of a gift? 
  Conducting business according to the MOU and Annex III of 
the 
Joint Declaration are the obligations Britain must shoulder. No 
civilized country honestly complying with an international 
treaty would consider implementing a diplomatic agreement as the 
bestowal of a gift. 
  Whatever package is proposed by British Hong Kong, the Hong 
Kong people will strongly demand that its financial arrangements 
conform with the MOU and Annex III of the Joint Declaration. 
Only thus will the Hong Kong people's tax burden and "ticket 
fare" not be increased and can the new airport project avoid low 
efficiency or "degenerating into a mess."

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Says the Fourth New Airport </F>
Financial Arrangements Are Not a Lunar New Year Gift From the 
British Hong Kong Government"] 
  [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA News 
Agency Hong Kong Branch, pointed out yesterday that the latest 
airport financial arrangements are not a Lunar New Year gift 
from British Hong Kong to Hong Kong people and China because 
Britain ought to build the airport according to the Memorandum 
of Understanding [MOU] on the airport. As the agency has not 
received the package in question, Zhang Junsheng stated that he 
would decide on public comment only after he has learned the 
details of the package. 
  When asked by a reporter about his view on the airport 
financial arrangement package after attending the closing 
ceremony of A China Cultural Journey, Zhang said: The airport 
MOU was signed by the leaders of the two governments in 
September 1991. It has been two years since the document was 
signed. The British Hong Kong authorities ought to have 
conducted affairs conscientiously according to the provisions of 
the MOU and should not have stalled. Therefore, he believes that 
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's analogy of a Lunar New Year 
gift to Hong Kong people and China is wrong. 
  Zhang criticized Britain for coming up with so many 
packages, 
but they either did not comply with the MOU or threaten to leave 
the special administrative region [SAR] government with a huge 
burden. Naturally, China could not agree. Thus it is not a gift 
from British Hong Kong to the public; it is something that 
everybody is entitled to. 
  Zhang continued: The airport is in Hong Kong and the money 
spent is all Hong Kong taxpayers' money. It should benefit Hong 
Kong people and should not increase their burdens, and in 
particular, it should not leave a burden on the future SAR 
government. There are only three years and five months left 
before Hong Kong reverts to China. Therefore, it should not 
leave a burden on Hong Kong; the SAR is going to be in Hong Kong 
for a long, long time.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by Yu Hong (0060 3163): "A Rational Response </F>
-- Comment on Percy Craddock's Article Entitled: `Patten Has 
Got It Wrong Again'"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 2 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Chris 
Patten went back to Britain a few days ago. At a hearing of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons, in addition 
to continuing his attack on the Chinese side, he also distorted 
facts, used lame arguments, and wantonly attacked some British 
personalities who are relatively more rational in the 
Sino-British disputes over constitutional issues. 
  This move by Chris Patten naturally called forth responses 
from people with breadth of vision, including the abovementioned 
personalities. Akers-Jones refuted Chris Patten's distortion 
and slander against him as a "cheap jibe." Percy Craddock even 
published an article entitled "Patten `Has Got It Wrong' Again" 
in Hong Kong's SOUTH CHINA SUNDAY MORNING POST. In a cool and 
rational style, Craddock used facts to clarify Chris Patten's 
distortion and attacks. The rational response from Percy 
Craddock is in striking contrast to Chris Patten's character and 
morals as one who is rude and unreasonable and who fabricates 
lies. It has provided reference material, which is hard to come 
by, to help people understand the right and wrong of the 
Sino-British controversies over constitutional issues. 
<H3>  No Consultations With the Chinese Side Before Publishing 
Chris Patten's Proposals </H3>
  The Joint Declaration states: In order to ensure a smooth 
transfer of government in Hong Kong in 1997, China and Britain 
are to "continue their discussions in a friendly spirit and 
develop the cooperative relationship that already exists between 
the two Governments over Hong Kong with a view to the effective 
implementation of the Joint Declaration." In the second half of 
the transitional period, "there will be need for closer 
cooperation," and "joint consideration of measures to be adopted 
for a smooth transition in 1997." However, Chris Patten has 
gone in the opposite direction. A year and a half have passed 
since he took up the post as governor of Hong Kong. He has done 
nothing good to safeguard and maintain Hong Kong's economic 
prosperity and social stability, but instances of his 
conspicuous behavior in opposing Sino-British cooperation are 
numerous. Percy Craddock disclosed that Chris Patten's refusal 
to consult with the Chinese side on the constitutional reform 
proposals before making his policy address was his first major 
move of confrontation with Sino-British cooperation. 
  Facts have shown clearly that there was no consultation with 
the Chinese side prior to the formulation of the constitutional 
reform plan,and the plan was published unilaterally despite the 
admonition and warning of the Chinese side. Percy Craddock has 
always had reservations toward Chris Patten's refusal to consult 
with the Chinese in advance and his unilaterally dishing out and 
implementing a "three violations" constitutional reform package, 
ignoring the provisions of the Joint Declaration. Proceeding 
from the interests of Britain, he did not hesitate to criticise 
this openly. However, instead of making a self-examination, 
Chris Patten pretended to speak sternly at the Parliament, out 
of a sense of justice, blaming Percy Craddock, saying that this 
"is completely untrue, and that whether its was the result of 
misunderstanding or of other motivations is for Sir Percy to 
explain in due course." Since he distorted facts and made 
unfounded counter-charges, Percy Craddock had no alternative but 
to respond. 
  Quoting a passage from a book he had written, which would be 
published soon, Percy Craddock pointed out that the Chinese 
reaction to the "three violations" constitutional reform package 
dished out by Chris Patten was so violent "because of both the 
manner and the substance of the proposals. Although they were 
informed of the substance of the Governor's speech two weeks in 
advance, their request that they be consulted (which in their 
eyes probably meant negotiation) before the speech was delivered 
was rejected." What is especially interesting is that this 
passage had been "carefully checked" with the Foreign Office as 
part of the official clearance and had been "accepted." The 
statements in this passage, which has gone through official 
British clearance and is officially accepted, are exactly the 
same as what the Chinese side has said. Chris Patten, being an 
"intimate friend of the prime minister" and the person who 
concocted and dished out the "three violations" constitutional 
reform package, should know better than anyone else. However, he 
went so far as to deny them and falsely accused the person who 
spoke the truth as having other "motivations." This can show 
only that Chris Patten intentionally tried to withhold the truth 
and to continue deceiving Parliament and the British public in a 
bid to gain support for his erroneous stand. Recently, 
Sino-U.S. relations have been improving, China's domestic 
situation has become more and more favorable, and more and more 
Hong Kong people have come to understand China's policy toward 
Hong Kong and have identified themselves with it. On the other 
hand, Chris Patten's constitutional reform plan has been opposed 
by more and more Hong Kong people, and has been criticized by 
industrial and commercial circles and by people with breadth of 
vision of other circles in Britain. Under such circumstances, 
Chris Patten, after returning to Britain, indeed had no way to 
court support in Britain other than to disguise himself, resort 
to sophistry, and withhold the truth. 

<H5>    Chris Patten Deliberately Practices "Three Violations" </H5>
  At the hearing, Chris Patten also said that Percy Craddock 
had not told him in advance of "the existing political and 
constitutional settlement," implying that although Percy 
Craddock knew very well that his constitutional reform plan was 
one of "three violations," he had no objection. The fact is 
that everyone knows very well that Percy Craddock does not agree 
with Chris Patten's abandoning the relevant Sino-British 
diplomatic agreements and understanding, takes an attitude of 
reservation toward his constitutional reform plan, opposes open 
confrontation with Sino-British cooperation, and takes the stand 
of regarding such confrontation as "the tragedy of Hong Kong." 
Chris Patten has completely confounded black and white in his 
attempt to put Percy Craddock in the ranks of those who show 
support the "three violations" constitutional reform plan. 
  In his article, Percy Craddock said that at that time, he 
"had no inkling of plans to circumvent existing arrangements and 
substantially widen the electorate by bringing in a new kind of 
functional constituency." On the contrary, he explicitly 
advised Chris Patten: "Given the existing agreements," the 
British side "has very limited room for maneuver"; "it is 
dangerous to disregard Chinese objections to any increase in the 
number of directly elected seats in 1995; and therefore, it is 
necessary to work within the agreed framework." This is 
tantamount to clearly and correctly reminding Chris Patten that 
by no means should he go beyond the agreements and understanding 
reached with China to make the so-called constitutional reform 
plan. 
  The Joint Declaration officially came into effect as early 
as 
1985 and the Basic Law also was published long ago. Chris 
Patten also bragged that he "read the Basic Law more frequently 
than the Bible." Regarding the agreements and understanding 
concerned, which were reached by the foreign ministers of the 
two countries, even if Chris Patten did not know about them in 
advance, did he ever show any indication or take any action to 
return to the "three conformities" when the Chinese side 
explained to him, item by item, and explicitly pointed out his 
mistakes of "three violations?" Moreover, Chris Patten also has 
repeatedly undermined Sino-British talks on arrangements for the 
1994-95 elections in Hong Kong. Consequently, no positive 
results were attained and the talks finally broke down. 
Evidently, it is not that Percy Craddock did not tell Chris 
Patten the gains and losses in advance, but that Chris Patten 
turned a deaf ear to the advice, and deliberately and stubbornly 
took the road of confrontation with the Chinese side. He cannot 
shirk his responsibility for the deterioration in Sino-British 
relations. 
<H5>  Who Is Responsible for the British Interests? </H5>
  In view of Chris Patten's attack to the effect that Percy 
Craddock "advocates an indulgent policy" toward the Chinese 
side, Percy Craddock pointed out that if the British side 
insists on not cooperating with the Chinese side on the Hong 
Kong issue, "the Chinese do not have to negotiate at all; they 
could dictate, or simply wait until 1997, when, by the mere 
passage of time, Hong Kong will fall into their hands with no 
restraints on their freedom of action." In a certain sense, 
this has reflected the truth. It also shows that Percy Craddock 
has a far better understanding of China than does Chris Patten. 
The British side once insisted on continuing the governing of 
Hong Kong after 1997, and it was willing to hold talks on the 
issue of returning Hong Kong only after Deng Xiaoping sternly 
warned the British side that if it did not change its attitude, 
the Chinese side would be compelled to announce unilaterally the 
principles and policies for resolving the Hong Kong issue. The 
reason is quite simple: Since time immemorial, Hong Kong has 
been a part of China's territory, and the Chinese Government has 
an absolute right to recover Hong Kong at any time. The three 
unequal treaties which Britain imposed on the Chinese people 
through such illegal means as armed invasion cannot have the 
authority of international law. Still less will Britain be able 
to continue forcibly occupying Hong Kong in the 1980's [year as 
published]. Therefore, Britain's returning Hong Kong to China 
is a question of respecting facts and legal principles, and is 
not a so- called question of "indulgence" or "kow towing." 
Chris Patten's wishful thinking of implementing the "three 
violations" constitutional reform plan and of attempting 
effectively to extend the privileges and interests of the 
British colonial rule after 1997 is precisely a repetition of 
Britain's past mistake of demanding to continue its colonial 
rule in Hong Kong and underestimating the firm confidence and 
strength of the Chinese side in safeguarding the principle of 
sovereignty. His experience and knowledge is a far cry from 
that of the more practical Percy Craddock! 
  In his article, Percy Craddock also held that "the more we 
can work out by agreement, the greater the protection. That is 
what made the achievement of the Joint Declaration so 
important." Facts have precisely proved this. The signing of 
the Joint Declaration has given a definite date for Britain to 
hand over Hong Kong to China, has established the principles and 
mechanism for close Sino-British cooperation for a smooth 
transfer in 1997, and has provided sufficient protection for the 
rational interests of the British side in Hong Kong during the 
transitional period and after 1997. The principle of 
convergence with the Basic Law, the agreements and understanding 
between the two sides concerning arrangements for the elections 
in 1994-95, and the memorandum of understanding on the new 
airport are all beneficial to both sides. As long as the 
British side abides by all agreements on Hong Kong between the 
two sides, Hong Kong will benefit, and the existing and future 
interests of the British side also will be well protected. 
  The interests of the British side can exist only within 
Sino- 
British agreements, and not outside them. Percy Craddock has 
warned repeatedly that on the issue of Hong Kong, the 
Sino-British agreements and understanding cannot be ignored, and 
that the road of confrontation with the Chinese side should 
never be taken. This should be said to be a rational direction 
for protecting the interests of Britain. The purpose of Chris 
Patten's persistence in "three violations" confrontation is to 
turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political 
entity, and to preserve the absolute influence of the British 
side so as to grab illegal privileges and the interests of 
colonial rule outside the Sino-British agreements. In addition, 
Chris Patten's gambling with politics in Hong Kong also has a 
personal political objective, but it is evident that all this 
will fall through. In addition, the interests of Hong Kong, and 
even those of Britain, will be damaged by Chris Patten's 
confrontation activities. Is it not very clear, who -- Percy 
Craddock or Chris Patten -- as personalities of British 
political circles, really is responsible for the interests of 
his own country?

Region's Recover-Hong Kong Exercises"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  "Ulterior Motives" in the Campaign To Criticize 
Chris Patten </H3>
  Hong Kong is in the run-up to its return to the Chinese 
mainland, but this run-up is faced with many variables, for 
China and Britain have parted company, "each going its own way." 
Beijing's repeated references to recovering Hong Kong ahead of 
schedule make the "run-up" even more unpredictable.... 
  One sign drawing special attention is that the entire city 
of 
Beijing has been "mobilized spiritually," and public opinion has 
been prepared for "the elimination of the proxies of the British 
colonialists." 
  Friends in Beijing's political circles told this writer that 
they also have noticed the CPC's tune in the campaign to 
criticize Chris Patten -- exaggerating the matter and raising 
the Hong Kong issue to the higher plane of "safeguarding the 
motherland." According to their analysis, the CPC top 
leadership "has ulterior motives" in this move, for the British 
have never said that they will hold on to Hong Kong after 1 July 
1997; moreover, what worries the Beijing authorities most does 
not seem to be Hong Kong's economy (they believe that with the 
backing of the huge mainland market, Hong Kong's role as a 
"window" will not be weakened; on the contrary, Hong Kong will 
become more prosperous than before), but the ways to "rule over" 
the 6 million Hong Kong people. They believe that under Hong 
Kong's present situation -- wherein democrats, who Beijing 
considers "anti-China" elements who are attempting to turn Hong 
Kong into chaos, still enjoy the popular support of the public 
-- Hong Kong may "get out of control" after 1997. Friends in 
Beijing said jokingly: Everything would be OK if democrats in 
Hong Kong enjoyed as little credibility as the members of the 
Preliminary Working Committee [PWC]! 
<H3>  Jiang Zemin Stresses the Need To "Eliminate the Influence of 
British Colonialism" </H3>
  We can get an inkling of the matter from Jiang Zemin's 
recent 
speech on the Hong Kong issue. 
  In the speech he delivered at a Political Bureau meeting at 
the beginning of this month [January], Jiang Zemin stressed the 
following points: National sovereignty is above all else, and 
Hong Kong's sustained stability and development is the 
foundation. Alongside the changes in Hong Kong's political 
situation, the central authorities, based on the aforementioned 
line and policies, will draw up resolute decisions and measures 
to safeguard national sovereignty, eliminate the evil legacy of 
British colonialism and the pernicious influence of the proxies 
of British colonialists, and put into practice the PRC's policy 
of "one country, two systems." 
  Does the "elimination of the evil legacy of British 
colonialism and the pernicious influence of the proxies of 
British colonialists" mean that a campaign of political 
"disinfection" will be carried out in Hong Kong after 1997? 
  On 10 January, the key points of Jiang Zemin's speech were 
relayed to the ministries, commissions, and the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, as well as to the 
party committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities. 
<H5>  Qian Qichen Again Clarifies the Chinese Side's Bottom Line </H5>
  The speech by Qian Qichen, who is in charge of Hong Kong 
affairs, also was relayed to the ministries, commissions, and 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, as 
well as to the party committees of all provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities. In his speech, he made a 
thoroughgoing analysis of Hong Kong's present situation, and 
emphatically pointed out the British authorities "plot." His 
speech is divided into the following three parts: 
  1. Britain has changed its China policy; 
  2. Britain's purpose in deliberately sabotaging the Joint 
Declaration and the agreements already reached between the two 
countries; 
  3. The initiative is always in China's hands. 
  Qian Qichen stressed in his speech that Sino-British 
relations will turn for the worse as a result of Britain's 
plotted moves to sabotage the Joint Declaration and to openly 
deny any agreements already reached between the two countries. 
This is an inevitable result of Britain's China policy, which 
is formulated after the U.S. China policy, and Sino-British 
relations will be unlikely to return to normal in the coming 
three years or even for a considerable period to come. China 
will not take the initiative to improve its ties with Britain. 
It has never begged Britain for compromises, it does not 
currently beg, nor will it do so in the future. This is the 
policy of the Chinese Government toward Britain. 
<H3>  Scaring People by Predicting the Emergence of "Chaotic 
Phenomena" in Hong Kong </H3>
  Qian Qichen then switched to another subject: "The further 
Britain and the British Hong Kong Government slide down the 
wrong road of violating and sabotaging the Joint Declaration and 
the agreements already reached between the two countries, and of 
denouncing the Basic Law, which is purely China's internal 
affair, the easier it will be for us to find a fundamental 
solution to the matter. Both the initiative and the timing are 
in our hands. In order to prolong its rule in Hong Kong, the 
British authorities have brought up in a planned way a number of 
pro-British, pro-U.S., and anti-China ultra right forces to 
contend with the government of the future special administrative 
region [SAR], and to turn Hong Kong into a political city in 
which foreign countries will scramble for spheres of influence. 
In order to safeguard the national sovereignty and dignity of 
the Chinese people, in addition to making political, propaganda, 
and economic preparations, we also will follow the development 
of the situation with close interest and prepare to pay certain 
costs as long as we can deter Britain from succeeding with its 
plot." 
  All this serves to show clearly the Beijing authorities' 
state of mind, that is, the Beijing authorities wish for Hong 
Kong to run into chaos so they can adopt "antiriot" measures 
with perfect justice and eliminate all democratic figures who 
now enjoy public support. If this is the case, even though they 
are flying in the face of the people's will, they can cover the 
truth with the signboard of "safeguarding national sovereignty 
and dignity." 
  Qian Qichen also scared people by claiming that political 
turmoil will take place in Hong Kong during the transitional 
period and after China's recovery on 1 July 1994. British 
colonialism and U.S. hegemonism undoubtedly will support the 
anti-China ultra right forces in Hong Kong in stirring up 
trouble and fanning the flames of disorder under all kinds of 
pretenses with the aim of opposing the central government and 
terminating colonial rule, the Basic Law, the PLA garrison, and 
the PWC, which has been set up with the approval of the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress. The central 
government, however, is entirely capable of taking the situation 
into its own hands and of coping with the sabotage of 
pro-British, pro-U.S., and anti-China ultra right forces. 
Anti-China ultra rightists who throw in their lot with foreign 
forces with the intention of stirring up trouble are only a tiny 
minority in Hong Kong. 
<H5>  Deliberately Strangling Hong Kong's Democrats </H5>
  This writer once reported in the 1993 December Issue of 
CHENG 
MING that the CPC had already drawn up a blacklist of Hong Kong 
people, and without any legal trial have determined their nature 
as "anti-China ultra rightists with the intention of stirring up 
disorder in Hong Kong" by using the same standards as those used 
for "counter-revolutionaries" on the mainland. The fact that 
Qian Qichen foresaw a disordered and chaotic Hong Kong, and that 
he placed all the blame on Hong Kong's democrats, who China 
considers "thorns in its flesh," obviously shows that China 
intends to spare none of these democrats when the time comes. 
  People cannot help asking: Now that Beijing believes that 
"anti-China ultra rightists who intend to stir up disorder in 
Hong Kong" are only a tiny minority in Hong Kong, why take these 
people so seriously, make so many threats in a such a flustered 
and exasperated manner, and stress the issue over and over 
again? How can the PRC, as large and great as it is, be 
perplexed by "this tiny minority" of people? 
<H3>  The Ultimate Target of the CPC Is To Counter the Hong Kong 
People </H3>
  As a matter of fact, by acting against democrats in Hong 
Kong, the CPC ultimately aims at countering the overwhelming 
majority of Hong Kong people. Having lived in a free and 
well-informed society for such a long time, the Hong Kong people 
have developed their own political views and moral standards. 
The 4 June incident, which took place in Beijing in 1989, as 
well as the CPC's encirclement and suppression of democrats in 
Hong Kong will not shake their fixed beliefs easily. A recent 
public opinion poll has showed that the Hong Kong United 
Democrats, who are considered enemies by the CPC, still are the 
most popular political party in Hong Kong. By comparison, the 
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, a pro-China 
base camp, ranks last on the list. Another public opinion poll 
also has showed that most Hong Kong people share the Hong Kong 
governor's view that PWC members lack credibility and cannot 
represent the interests of any group. Under such circumstances, 
the greatest difficulty facing the CPC in its recovery of Hong 
Kong is how to bring about a U-turn in the ideology of the Hong 
Kong people and make them recognize the outlook of value 
practiced in their socialist motherland. 
<H5>  "We Have the Ability To Recover Hong Kong in a Single Night" </H5>
  There have been many conjectures concerning the CPC's 
recovery of Hong Kong ahead of schedule. People generally 
believe that Beijing will not take such a reckless action. Qian 
Qichen gave a clear-cut answer on this issue: "The Chinese 
Government has studied this issue carefully and has made a 
decision, that is, if the British side wishes to return Hong 
Kong to us tomorrow, we will tell them: Alright, on the same 
night. However, we are not going to give them a receipt." 
  It also was revealed in Qian Qichen's relayed report that 
the 
relevant sides have made sufficient preparations: Once drastic 
changes or turmoil take place in Hong Kong, the PLA basically is 
able to bring the situation under control within four hours. 
<H3>  A Military Maneuver Aiming at Quelling Turbulence in Hong 
Kong </H3>
  I do not believe the following is a fabricated story: 
According to a source from the Guangzhou Military Region, on 2 
January, crack troops from the 12th Regiment, the 25th Division 
of a group army garrisoning Guangdong's Conghua Prefecture and 
the special mobile forces of the 7th Regiment under the 
Guangdong Provincial District carried out a joint military 
maneuver code-named "Success 240," a contingency exercise aiming 
at stamping out any political turmoil or political incidents 
stirred up by Britain during Hong Kong's transitional period. 
With the airborne support of a helicopter regiment under an air 
unit of the ground force, the entire maneuver took only 200 
minutes to complete. It turns out that Qian Qichen's boast that 
"turbulence in Hong Kong can be put down" within four hours (240 
minutes) is based on this latest military exercise. What 
particularly should be mentioned is that the "240" in the 
codename of the maneuver refers to the maneuver's predetermined 
length of 240 minutes. Yet, the exercise went so smoothly that 
it came to a successful end in only 200 minutes. 
  Many senior-ranking officials showed up and watched the 
"Success 240" military maneuver, among whom were Lei Mingqiu, 
deputy political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region and 
commander of a group army, as well as officials from the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. The Guangzhou 
Military Region held a summarization meeting on the second day 
following the conclusion of the maneuver. At the meeting, Xie 
Fei, member of the CPC Political Bureau, read out a message of 
congratulations from the State Council on this "tremendously 
successful military exercise." 
  It affords food for thought that the congratulatory message 
was sent by the State Council, not by the CPC Central Military 
Commission. Does this mean that the CPC's arrangements for 
using military means to recover Hong Kong also are in the run-up?

  [Text] Beijing, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Three men jailed in 
1989 and 1990 for crimes in the June 1989 anti-government riot 
in China were recently given early releases -- in two cases many 
years before expiry of their sentences. 
  Xiao Bin, Liao Yiwu and Ding Junze were recently released by 
local intermediate people's courts, sources here said today. 
  Xiao Bin, 46, was released on parole. He was a worker at an 
aluminum window factory in Dalian city, Liaoning Province, 
before he was arrested. 
  In July 1989 he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment by 
the Dalian Intermediate People's Court for inciting disturbance 
in the June 1989 anti-government riot in Beijing. 
  On December 11, 1991, the Chaoyang City Intermediate 
People's 
Court reduced his prison term by six months because of his 
penitence. On February 2 this year, the Chaoyang City 
Intermediate People's Court decided to grant Xiao parole because 
of his good behavior in prison over the years. Xiao expressed 
gratitude for the kind treatment and regretted over his crimes. 
  Liao Yiwu, 34, was an employee at the People's Cultural 
Center in Fuling city, Sichuan Province. In January 1990, the 
Chongqing City Intermediate People's Court sentenced Liao to 
four years in jail from March 16, 1990 to March 15, 1994 for his 
crimes in anti-government activities. 
  On January 31 this year, the Dachuan City Intermediate 
People's Court decided to release him before expiry of his 
sentence because of his penitence and good behavior in jail. 
  Ding Junze, formerly a teacher at Shanxi University, was 
sentenced by the Taiyuan City Intermediate People's Court on 
June 25, 1990 to 12 years' imprisonment for inciting 
anti-government activities in June 1989. 
  Ding, 52, now suffers from heart disease and cervical 
vertebra disease, and on February 2 this year, the court decided 
to free him on bail for medical treatment.

<F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F>
"Human Rights Conditions in China Have Improved Significantly"] 
  [Text] In the early seventies, a U.S. reporter, who had 
experience of covering news in old China, revisited China when 
Sino-U.S. relations began to thaw. When meeting with Premier 
Zhou, he said with deep feelings that during his visit he had 
found that China had traversed a long journey and had made great 
progress. Premier Zhou answered: We still have a long way to go. 
  The Chinese are a modest people, and they normally do not 
brag about their own achievements to foreigners. Speaking 
realistically, China remains a developing country with a huge 
population, and still faces the extremely arduous task of 
modernization. Therefore, it has formulated a long-term 
development strategy with economic construction as its central 
task, and China is determined to improve its people's material 
and cultural lives through the unswerving efforts of several 
generations of people. Although time now has come to the 
nineties, as Premier Zhou said in the past, the Chinese people 
still have a long way to go. On the other hand, in retrospect, 
new China indeed has made substantial progress, which also 
should be appraised realistically and should not be denied. 
China has made great progress and has further efforts still to 
make. This is the actual condition of the country, and this is 
also the case in the field of human rights. 
  Old China was bullied and humiliated by foreign powers, and 
the people did not have any independent political or other 
rights while living under colonial and semicolonial conditions. 
Innumerable people were killed in continuing disastrous wars, 
and human rights were just empty talk in such circumstances. 
Fundamental changes were brought about by the success of the 
Chinese revolution and the establishment of the People's 
Republic, and only after that could the people's lives and 
safety really be guaranteed and the nation move onto to the path 
of development. The liberation of China turned human rights 
into reality in the country. By comparison, in today's world, 
"genocide" is still occurring in some European countries, and 
human life is treated there as if it were not worth a straw; 
"social purification" occurred in South America, and a large 
number of street urchins were mistreated and killed. If they 
were to see this, all justice-upholding people might not 
underestimate the progress China has made in the aspect of human 
rights. 
  China's reform and opening beginning in 1978 was another 
emancipation. In the last 15 years, with the high-speed 
economic growth, the people's living standards have been 
enhanced, the legal system gradually has been perfected, the 
market mechanism has been fostered, the scope of human and 
material movements has been broadened, and the people's freedom 
and rights have been improved in many aspects. No person who 
holds an objective and fair attitude will deny all these facts. 
  China is making continuing efforts to improve human rights 
conditions, but this is, first of all, China's own affair. The 
Chinese people deeply believe that advancing along this course 
of maintaining stability and developing the economy, greater 
progress certainly will be made in the aspect of human rights. 
Different nations view human rights in different ways, and all 
nations have yet to improve their own human rights conditions in 
various aspects. They may conduct dialogue and exchanges on this 
issue, thus promoting each other's improvement of human rights 
conditions. For example, in the United States, the social 
status and human rights conditions of national minorities still 
need to be improved; there are an increasing number of 
single-parent families, and the rights of their members should 
be looked after. The United States, however, pursues double 
standards and often tries to interfere in China's internal 
affairs under the pretext of human rights. This will do 
absolutely nothing good for the improvement of China's human 
rights. If the issue of human rights is linked with trade and 
if Sino-U.S. bilateral trade is harmed for this reason, the 
situation will not be in the economic interests of the United 
States itself, and also will do no good for the improvement of 
its domestic conditions.

  It is believed the party chief gave a generally positive 
assessment of the city in its role as a "national testing 
ground" for market reforms. 
  And premier Li Peng, who was in Zhuhai this week, will 
reportedly make an inspection tour of Shenzhen before 
officiating at the opening ceremony of the Daya Bay nuclear

  [Text] Macau, Feb 3 (AFP)--Former Chinese president Yang 
Shangkun is vacationing at a posh resort in Zhuhai, next door to 
Macao, Portugal's Lusa News Agency reported Thursday. It said 
it was able to confirm that Yang, 87, was staying at the 
Shijingshan (Rockview Mountain) resort, where reporters found "a 
strong Public Security Bureau presence." There were also 
unconfirmed reports that Premier Li Peng was also in Zhuhai, 
ahead of this weekend's inauguration of the Daya Bay nuclear 
power plant northeast of Hong Kong, Lusa said. 
  But Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda ducked questions from Macau 
reporters when asked to confirm if Li was in town. "As far as I 
know, Premier Li Peng has arrived in Guangdong, but it is 
unclear yet what actually his situation in Zhuhai is," Lusa 
quoted Liang as saying. 
  Li last visited Zhuhai one year ago for three days. 
  Earlier reports in Hong Kong newspapers, quoting Guangdong 
officials, have said paramount leader Deng Xiaoping will be in 
the economically thriving province for the Lunar New Year 
holidays, which begin February 10.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Li Peng Ends Inspection Tour in </F>
Zhuhai, Urges Zhuhai To Speed Up Development of Hengqin Dao"] 
  [Text] Zhuhai, 3 Feb (TA KUNG PAO)--State Council Premier 
Li Peng today concluded a five-day inspection of Zhuhai. While 
inspecting Zhuhai, Li Peng said that in the surging tide of 
reform and opening up, Zhuhai's construction had been 
successful, and Zhuhai's experience should be spread to the 
whole country and should be learned from by other parts of the 
country. It was learned that Li Peng also instructed Zhuhai to 
quicken the development of Hengqing Dao, and called the island a 
piece of treasured land. Li Peng also gave important 
instructions on the construction of primary and secondary 
borderlines and other important basic projects in Zhuhai. In 
addition, Yang Rudai, vice chairman of the National Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], 
and Hu Ping, director of the State Council's Special Economic 
Zone Affairs Office, also inspected Zhuhai recently. 
  Li Peng arrived in Zhuhai on 29 January. During his stay in 
Zhuhai, Li Peng listened to work reports by Zhuhai Mayor Liang 
Guangda, who is also secretary of the city party committee, and 
he also inspected Zhuhai's western district and some enterprises 
and projects in the city in the company of Liang and other 
Guangdong officials. 
  It was learned that when inspecting Zhuhai, Li Peng said 
that 
in the surging tide of reform and opening, Zhuhai's construction 
had been successful, and its experience should be introduced and 
disseminated to all parts of the country. Li Peng expressed 
satisfaction and appreciation for the achievements made by 
Zhuhai in its economic construction in the last few years. 
  Reportedly, Li Peng called for quickening the development of 
Hengqing Dao, saying that the island is a very special piece of 
treasured land and should be properly developed as soon as 
possible. 
  According to sources, Li Peng also affirmed the border 
management policy of "relaxing control on the primary line and 
tightening control on the secondary line," and instructed Zhuhai 
to continue to run the special economic zone well, thus playing 
an exemplary role for the people of the whole country. 
  In addition, Yang Rudai, vice chairman of the CPPCC National 
Committee, and Hu Ping, director of the State Council's Special 
Economic Zone Affairs Office, also inspected Zhuhai separately 
on Monday [31 January] and Tuesday [1 February] of this week. 
Yang Rudai said that Zhuhai had raised construction funds 
through its land, and wasted hills have been transformed into 
treasured land. More land is being prepared in the course of 
development. Thus, Zhuhai has turned itself into an 
economically prosperous and beautiful city without needing any 
money allocated by the state. It has gained some very 
successful experience and has painted a good picture. It is 
hoped that Zhuhai will become "China's Singapore." 
  After inspecting Zhuhai, Hu Ping also said that the special 
economic zones should still be special and should create a 
special microclimate to heat up their economies. In the course 
of reform and opening and in the process of developing the 
socialist market economy, the special economic zones should play 
a leading role. Hu Ping inspected Yazhou Fangzhen Company, a 
biochemical pharmaceutical factory, a shopping center, some 
duty-free shops, and some large construction projects in the 
western district of the city.

  [Text] Recently, while expressing solicitude for teachers 
of rural primary and middle schools in mountainous areas of 
Hebei Province, Li Lanqing, member of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council, 
pointed out that governments at all levels should further 
enhance their understanding of rudimentary education in the 
countryside, should adopt measures to strengthen and improve 
compulsory education in the countryside, should conscientiously 
tackle problems related to teachers' wages and residences, and 
should make continued efforts to improve the expertise of 
teachers and the quality of teaching so as to train a large 
number of useful professionals for the economic development of 
the countryside and lay a good foundation for ensuring the 
on-schedule fulfillment of the target of having the people 
become relatively well-off and for ensuring the prosperity of 
the rural economy. 
  On 30 and 31 January, accompanied by Cheng Weigao, secretary 
of the provincial party committee, Ye Liansong, governor of the 
province, Xu Zhijian, deputy secretary general of the State 
Council, and Liu Bin, vice minister of the State Education 
Commission, Vice Premier Li Lanqing visited, in spite of the 
severe cold, Shijiazhuang city, Baoding city, and Baoding 
Prefecture to investigate and study the educational work in the 
countryside and went deep to five primary and middle schools in 
mountainous areas of Pingshan and Shunping counties to express 
solicitude for teachers. Whenever he arrived in a school, 
Comrade Li Lanqing conscientiously inspected schoolrooms and 
teachers' dormitories, cordially inquired about teachers' 
situation in work, livelihood, wage payment, and teaching, and 
sent, on behalf of the State Council, cordial regards to the 
vast numbers of rural teachers, teachers in mountainous areas in 
particular, who have long worked silently with all their hearts 
under difficult conditions. 
  In recent years, leaders at all levels in the province have 
paid high attention to education, have energetically promoted 
reform and development in education, have constantly attached 
importance to rudimentary education, have adopted resolute 
measures to continuously improve teachers' remunerations, have 
solved in a timely manner the problem that once emerged 
concerning teachers' unpaid wages and have been studying ways to 
formulate a guarantee mechanism to ensure the fulfillment of the 
rudimentary education target and for eliminating the deferred 
wage payment to teachers. 
  After hearing this, Comrade Li Lanqing was very happy and 
fully affirmed it. During the inspection, Comrade Li Lanqing 
repeatedly stressed that rudimentary education is the foundation 
of all sorts of education which concerns the quality of 
education in the entire nation. Because 800 million of China's 
population lives in the countryside, the difficult and focal 
points of rudimentary education lie in the countryside. If 
peasants have no knowledge and no agricultural skills, it is 
impossible to develop the rural economy or to fulfill the 
nationwide objective of having the people become relatively 
well-off. Therefore, governments at all levels and all 
educational and administrative departments must exert great 
efforts in conscientiously developing rudimentary education in 
the countryside. The education in the countryside must be 
carried out in line with local conditions by giving full 
consideration to the actual demands and circumstances of the 
countryside. We should conscientiously study ways to reform the 
school administration in the countryside. Comrade Li Lanqing 
fully affirmed Shunping County's methods of adding the content 
of professional education to train a large number of new 
peasants, who have both knowledge and agricultural skills, at 
the present stage of developing rudimentary education in the 
countryside. He said: In the countryside, it is a good way to 
give overall consideration to agriculture, science, and 
education. It will not only be conducive to training more 
useful skilled persons for the countryside and accelerating the 
development of rural economy but will also effectively make the 
nine-year compulsory education universal in the countryside. 
  On the morning of 31 January, Comrade Li Lanqing also talked 
with leaders of the province, responsible persons of pertinent 
departments, and teacher representatives on the reform and 
development of higher education, vocational education, and adult 
education and listened to their opinions and suggestions.

  [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Bo Yibo, a retired 
veteran Chinese leader, said that China must combine development 
speed with high economic returns. 
  In an impromptu speech at a forum here yesterday, he said 
that a "comprehensive understanding" of Deng Xiaoping's 
exposition on the development speed and economic returns is 
essential to maintaining sustained, rapid and healthy growth of 
China's economy. 
  He said that the country's economy is now growing 
vigorously, 
while initial successes have been made in macro-economic control. 
  The whole Chinese nation is trying hard to push China's 
economy to a new height by following the principle of seizing 
the current opportunity for development, deepening the reform, 
opening wider to the outside world, promoting development and 
maintaining stability, he told the forum on Deng Xiaoping's 
ideas concerning the improvement of economic returns. 
  Bo Yibo also called attention to the fact that low economic 
returns nationwide remain largely unchanged. For example, the 
composite index for industrial economic returns fell at the end 
of 1993. 
  He warned against the bad tendency rising in some localities 
toward blindly undertaking construction projects, overextending 
the construction scale, blindly seeking development speed and 
neglecting economic returns. 
  "The scale of fixed assets investment is so large as to 
exceed what China's financial capabilities can withstand," he 
said. 
  He criticized some mass media organizations for failing to 
highlight the importance of improving economic returns. 
  Under these circumstances, it is necessary to spread Deng 
Xiaoping's ideas on combining the development speed with 
economic returns to make sure that high speed and high economic 
returns promote each other. 
  Over the past ten-plus years, Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly 
stressed that the development speed must be combined with high 
economic returns, he said. 
  "We must try our best to achieve a relatively high growth 
rate," he told the forum. 
  According to Bo, it is both "possible and necessary" for 
China to achieve an annual growth rate of eight to nine percent 
in line with its economic strength, financial capabilities and 
materials supply. 
  "We must combine development speed with economic returns, 
product quality and market demand," he noted. 
  He opposed what he called a low development speed and 
underproduction which he said will adversely affect the 
improvement in China's overall economic strength and living 
standards. 
  Meanwhile, he also warned against excessive stockpiles and 
redundant construction. Inventories of manufacturers covered in 
government budgets amounted to 170 billion yuan at the end of 
last year, he added. 
  He said that the combination of high speed with high 
economic 
returns serves as an "inevitable road" for China to achieve 
modernization in three phases. 
  "This is not only an economic issue, but also a political 
issue," he said in conclusion.

  [Text] The provincial people's congress standing committee 
held a tea party on the afternoon of 27 Janaury. Present at the 
party were Peng Chong, vice chairman of the Seventh National 
People's Congress Standing Committee; Yuan Qitong, Su Changpei, 
Liu Yongye, Zhang Mingjun, and Song Jun, vice chairmen of the 
Eighth Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee; leading 
comrades of the fifth, sixth, and seventh provincial people's 
congress standing committees; and retired cadres at and above 
the departmental level from subordinate organs of the provincial 
people's congress. They happily gathered together to usher in 
the Spring Festival. 
  You Dexin, chairman of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference provincial committee, attended the tea 
party. Yuan Qitong presided over the party and, on behalf of 
the provincial people's congress standing committee, extended 
New Year's greetings to old comrades present at the party. 
  Amid warm applause, Comrade Peng Chong aired his view on the 
issue of the development of democracy and the legal system. He 
said: Developing a high degree of socialist democracy and a 
sound socialist legal system is our long-termn strategic task. 
To be sure, democracy is important, but it must be regulated by 
law and be put on a systematic basis. Without a legal system 
there will be no democracy. In particular, without a legal 
system, we will not be able to achieve our goal of establishing 
a socialist market economy. 
  Peng Chong said: The Fujian Provincial People's Congress 
Standing Committee has done a great deal of work in local 
legislation, playing an important role in promoting and 
defending reform, opening up, and economic construction, as well 
as social stability. It is necessary to heighten the sense of 
the legal system, adhere to the principle of acting according to 
the law, strictly enforce laws, intensify supervision over 
implementation of laws, and take effective measures to eliminate 
corruption and other ugly phenomena in the community. 
  Old comrades, including Cheng Xu, Zan Fumin, Wen Xiushan, 
Wang Zhe, and Zhang Yumin, also addressed the tea party.

  [Text] From 25 to 29 January, Yang Rudai, vice chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], inspected coastal areas in the 
Qinzhou Bay. Together with Wu Xihai, member of the National 
CPPCC Standing Committee, and accompanied by Guangxi CPPCC 
Chairman Chen Huiguang and Vice Chairman Yao Kelu, Yang Rudai 
visited the Fangcheng port, Qinzhou City, and Beihai City. 
  Yang Rudai and everyone happily toured the Fangcheng port, 
the newly built Qinzhou port, the Beihai deep water port, 
Weizhou island, and the Tieshan port. They also went to the 
Banzhou group company and Nanzhu group company in Qinzhou City 
as well as the Shuxiu and Yuntan gardens in Beihai City, where 
they had cordial talks with cadres and workers. 
  As the main initiator for the great southwest to move toward 
Southeast Asia, Yang Rudai took a particular interest in the 
construction of the southwest thoroughfare to the sea. All the 
way, he was happy to see rows of new buildings, broad roads, and 
busy ports. During discussions with local party and government 
leaders, he spoke highly of the great efforts made by leaders, 
cadres, and masses in Qinzhou Bay for the construction of the 
southwest thoroughfare, adding that they had made great 
achievements. 
  On how to properly handle relations between development and 
stability, he stressed: Through many years of reform, we have 
accumulated rich experience. We should be good at summing up 
experience, studying new situations, and resolving new problems, 
so as to maintain the sustained, speedy, and healthy development 
of the economy. 
  He also stressed: CPPCC organizations on all levels should 
fully display their superior role, take an active part in the 
deliberation of state affairs, help party committees and 
governments with their policymaking, and resolve all social 
contradictions in the course of deepening reform.

  [Text] As far as Chinese democracy fighter Wang Xizhe is 
concerned, the struggle for democracy is not confined to 
chanting slogans on the streets or writing big character 
posters. It also means how a person lives his life. One year 
after his release from Huaiji Prison near Guangzhou, Mr Wang is 
still trying to pick up the pieces he left behind when he was 
locked away 13 years ago for urging greater political freedom. 
  But to the authorities, the 45-year-old Marxist philosopher 
is still a target of surveillance, a dangerous person who has to 
be watched. To them, Mr Wang is also a criminal. Repeated 
appeals to clear his name have proven futile and he is still 
required to report to his neighbourhood police station every 
Friday and cannot travel outside Guangzhou without special 
permission. Contacts with foreigners are still a taboo. Not 
only is he prohibited from speaking to foreign reporters, he has 
also been warned that he should not write articles for foreign 
magazines. 
  Because of his criminal record, he cannot take part in any 
elections or run his own business like everybody does. Although 
nominally the boss of a jewellery shop in Guangzhou, the company 
is registered in other person's name. Even meetings with 
friends can be a problem, as he can only write to them, and even 
clients who met with him are often questioned by the police. 
  The pressure from authorities notwithstanding, Mr Wang has 
shown no signs of repentance. "If the time does not permit me 
to be a political activist now, then I will do what everybody 
does. I go into business," Mr Wang said. "It doesn't mean I 
have given up. Instead, I want to prove that we--democracy 
activists--are not only good at politics but we can also run a 
successful business," he said. 
  The jewellery business, he said, is his bridge to a 
modernised China. "I have been locked away for so many years. 
I have lost touch with the people ... Since everyone is now in 
business, I feel it is only right that I follow the trend of the 
society and join the business world. 
  "I may spend one year in this business. If I am successful, 
then I may open a bookstore and I plan to write a book on the 
democracy movement in Guangzhou if the conditions permits," he 
added. 
  However, Mr Wang admitted that he might not share the same 
view with other political activists who believe that they should 
play a more active role in the democracy movement. "I may not 
agree with everything they say. But we can disagree," he said. 
"I don't think we (activists in the 70s) are up to anything 
now. But one thing for sure, we are not going to disappear 
though," he added. 
  But not everyone is as lucky and optimistic as he is. 
According to Mr Wang, many activists are having difficulties in 
finding jobs and the authorities have never stopped their 
harassment of these people.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Arming People With Scientific </F>
Theory"] 
  [Text] At the national propaganda and ideological work 
meeting, which has just concluded, Comrade Jiang Zemin set out 
that the propaganda and ideological front, centering closely 
around the fundamental guiding principle of the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, should "arm the 
people with scientific theory, guide the people with correct 
public opinion, mold the people with a noble spirit, and 
encourage the people with fine works." The propaganda and 
ideological front must regard these as four key tasks to be 
fulfilled properly. 
  The "one fundamental guiding principle and four key tasks" 
put forward here are the general layout and strategic ideology 
for doing a good job in propaganda and ideological work in the 
course of speeding up the establishment of the new socialist 
market economy structure. This guiding principle is the soul 
that sets the orientation for all work, and the four key tasks 
are the concrete manifestation and end-result of the fundamental 
guiding principle. With the fundamental guiding principle, the 
four key tasks have a general program; are linked with, 
coordinated with, and promoted by each other; and provide 
strength for propaganda and ideological work as whole. On the 
other hand, with the four key tasks, the implementation of the 
fundamental guiding principle is a prop and can form a spiritual 
support for solidifying and invigorating the aspirations of the 
party and people. All comrades of the party, and especially 
comrades on the propaganda and ideological front, must firmly 
grasp "one fundamental guiding principle," strive to fulfill 
properly the "four key tasks," live up to high expectations, set 
sails in the direction of the current, and raise propaganda and 
ideological work to a higher level. 
  To fulfill the four key tasks properly, it is necessary, 
first of all, to grasp well the work of arming the people with 
scientific theory. Without arming the people with scientific 
theory, there can be no correct guidance for public opinion nor 
a clear orientation for ideological education and for developing 
the main theme. In this sense, "arming the people" runs through 
"guiding the people," "molding the people," and "encouraging the 
people." This year, we should proceed from study, research, and 
propaganda, and should deepen the work of arming the whole party 
with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics in an even more extensive and firm manner. It 
is necessary to further seriously study the original works, 
familiarizing ourselves with them and mastering them through 
comprehensive study. It is necessary to further develop and 
deepen the study of this theory and to mobilize the theoretical 
workers in various branches of science and the practical workers 
in various departments in all localities to open up a new 
situation of extensive, lively, and vigorous study of the 
theory. It is necessary to use the people's experience and 
various methods to further publicize and popularize this theory 
in light of reality, and especially in light of the reality 
since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee and since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made his remarks in 
the south. As some propaganda cadres have put it, properly 
grasping the study of leading cadres at and above the county and 
regiment level is the "key project" in arming the people with 
theory, properly grasping the study of party members and cadres 
in urban and rural grass-roots units is the "basic project" in 
arming the people with theory, and properly grasping the study 
and education of young people is the "project of hope" in arming 
the people with theory. Only by properly grasping the "three 
major projects" can the task of "arming the people with 
scientific theory" truly be fulfilled. 
  Fundamentally speaking, persisting in educating the cadres 
and people with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics is to help people clarify the 
significance of grasping the overall situation and to increase 
their ability to grasp the overall situation. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping is especially good at grasping and controlling the 
overall situation, and he is our brilliant example in making 
clear the orientation, dispersing the fog, opening up a path for 
advancement, and fulfilling tasks with flying colors. His 
scientific works and all his theories have proceeded from the 
overall situation. The CPC Central Committee set out that the 
overall situation of the work of the whole party in 1994 is: 
Grasping opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability [zhuazhu jiyu, 
shenhua gaige, kuoda kaifeng, cujin fazhan, baochi wending 2119 
0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245 2368 1129 7030 2397 0191 6651 
4099 1455 0202 2170 4489 1353]. All work must be subordinated 
to this overall situation and must serve this overall situation. 
In our further study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, in the new year, we also must focus our 
attention on clarifying and serving this overall situation. We 
must firmly grasp and treasure the present rare historical 
opportunity, unify our understanding, act in unison, achieve 
unity from top to bottom, make concerted efforts, and resolutely 
push forward reform, which we deliberated on for many years, 
wished to carry out, but for which we did not have the 
conditions to carry it out. "Reform is a move that determines 
China's destiny" and China's development is determined by 
reform. Lacking enthusiasm about deepening reform, and being 
enthusiastic only about the construction of more new projects 
and the expansion of existing ones cannot make the national 
economy develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner 
[chixu, kuaisu, jiankang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660]. 
  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is the great spiritual support of the whole 
party and nation, and is a brilliant banner guiding the new 
revolution of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. 
In the new year, we must make greater accomplishments in arming 
the people with theory and in seeking unity of thinking. Under 
the guidance of this banner, we must persist in the emancipation 
of our minds, seeking truth from facts, promoting and deepening 
reform, opening wider, and making great efforts to maintain 
stability so that we can have a clearer orientation and more 
lively thinking in all aspects of propaganda and ideological 
work, and can open up a new situation in this respect.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Central Committee 
for Comprehensive Management of Social Security and the Justice 
Ministry have jointly issued a circular on intensifying public 
security and law propagation during the Spring Festival. 
  The circular says: China today enjoys political stability 
and economic growth, the people live in peace and work in 
contentment, and the reform of the economic and political 
administrative systems are continuing. Nevertheless, we must 
soberly realize that we cannot afford to be optimistic about the 
state of security in certain places and departments. This is 
particularly true during the Spring Festival period when people 
will visit their families and friends, schools will be closed 
for holidays, and there will be all kinds of celebration 
activities. Lawless elements will take advantage of these 
opportunities to steal, rob, practice hooliganism, and abduct 
women and children; and such residual phenomena as gambling, 
prostitution, patronage of prostitutes, feudal superstitious 
habits, and other social viles are likely to resurface. Thus, 
leading party and government authorities must exert great 
efforts to ensure social security and intensify law propagation 
during the Spring Festival and consider this project an 
important assignment for safeguarding social stability. Plans 
should be drawn up and performance should be accessed 
collectively so that the people will have a peaceful and happy 
Spring Festival. 
  The circular urges all committees for comprehensive 
management of social security and judicial departments to work 
in conjunction with party committee propaganda departments to 
launch a project to publicize the law during the Spring 
Festival. It says: We should fully take advantage of radio and 
TV broadcasts, newspapers, and other modern mass media as well 
as literary and art shows and other projects, such as holding a 
propaganda week (or day), to publicize the significance of 
intensifying social security; to publicize "PRC Criminal Law" 
articles about punishment for conduct that endangers public 
safety, violates citizens' personal freedom and democratic 
rights, and infringes upon others' property; and also publicize 
the "PRC Regulations for Controlling Public Offenses" so that 
the masses will be reminded to abide by Chinese laws and 
regulations and take an active part in comprehensive management 
of social security, so that we will all understand our 
responsibility and work with various departments and units to 
safeguard social security. 
  The circular says: We must count on the masses and give full 
scope to the roles played by grass-roots units -- such as 
neighborhood and village committees, and crime squads formed by 
the masses -- to discover lawless conduct in time and harshly 
and promptly crack down on crimes which seriously undermine 
social security and order. All committees for comprehensive 
management of social security must coordinate with various other 
units to work with public security authorities to ensure 
security during the Spring Festival. Judicial authorities at all 
levels must intensify their control of and assistance and 
education for personnel undergoing reform or education through 
labor and take the initiative to assist public security 
authorities and party and government departments in placing, 
assisting, and educating those who are on probation. 
Grass-roots mediation organizations must actively provide 
mediation services so that factors that may sharpen 
contradictions will be nipped in the bud.

<F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>
  [Text] The development of our country's television 
industry in the giant tide of reform and opening up has 
attracted the attention of the world. At present, some 230 
million TV sets are owned by China's households, and China ranks 
first in the world in the annual production of TV sets. 
However, in 1978 there were only 7.5 million TV sets in China, 
a country with the largest population in the world. During the 
early eighties, TV sets were still in short supply in China's 
big and medium cities, and were rationed. On the black market, 
however, they were best-selling items. [Video begins with a 
birds-eye view of modern buildings and then cuts to television 
production lines, TV stores, TV stations, TV relay stations, and 
satellite ground receiving stations] 
  China's TV industry has witnessed rapid development in the 
past 15 years since the introduction of reform and opening up to 
the outside world. By the end of 1993 there were 614 TV 
stations in the country, and their programming has increased 
from the original 9,000 hours per annum to more than 150,000 
hours per annum at present. With the continuous progress in the 
building of a material and spiritual civilization, television 
sets have made their way into tens of thousands of households, 
increasingly becoming an indispensable part of the people's 
daily life in China. Television relay stations, big and small, 
are everywhere from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau to the shores of 
the East China Sea, and from the north to the Xisha Qundao 
[Paracel Islands]. At present some 32,000 satellite ground 
stations have been built in China, and TV programs now can be 
viewed by more 81 percent of the population. Today, new TV 
programs are being constantly introduced in China, and literary 
and art programs are blossoming in radiant splendor. More than 
5,000 sets of TV plays or dramas are televised, and their 
quality has improved steadily. 
  China's television now reaches, via satellite, more than 61 
countries and regions in Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Clear 
Chinese TV programs can be viewed in countries in North America 
and along the Caribbean Sea. China has established business 
links with the TV agencies of more than 100 countries and 
regions in the world. Television has served as a window for 
China, which is engaged in reform and opening up to the outside 
world. From this window China has learned something about the 
world, and through this window the world has been able to 
witness a China full of vigor and vitality.

<F P=106> ["Article" by special XINHUA commentator: "Enforce the Law </F>
Strictly To Win the People's Confidence"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan (XINHUA) -- Under the close 
attention of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, two 
representative cases involving bribery and abuse of powers in 
railroad departments have finally been brought to justice the 
other day, thereby reaffirming, in the eyes of the people, the 
party's and government's resolve to fight corruption and 
boosting the good image of the state's judicial organs enforcing 
the law strictly and impartially. 
  The whole proceedings of the two uncomplicated cases 
involving petty payoffs -- from being indicted to being 
pronounced innocent, from a pronouncement of not guilty to 
conviction -- may be described as a process of rigorous law 
enforcement whereby the sanctity of the law was safeguarded. In 
addition to throwing a sidelight on the difficulty and 
complexity involved in law enforcement, the two cases also 
reflect a problem in regard to law enforcement that must never 
be overlooked; that is, laws are still being implemented 
sluggishly. 
  Both cases -- the first involving the court reversing its 
erroneous ruling following an appeal filed by the procuratorate; 
the second involving the procuratorate amending a mistake of its 
own -- reflect the spirit of strict law enforcement. Being 
faithful to the law, to the facts, and to the people is a 
principle to be adhered to by all judicial organs and personnel. 
This principle is manifested only through scrupulous 
enforcement of the law; only when this is done can they win the 
people's confidence and be worthy of the honorable title of the 
people's judicial organs. 
  Strict enforcement of law requires administering fitting 
punishment in strict accordance with the criminal law and the 
supplementary provisions adopted by the National People's 
Congress; it also requires that criminal proceedings be carried 
out correctly in strict accordance with the Criminal Procedure 
Law. Neither of the two is dispensable. Handling cases in 
strict accordance with provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law 
is a legal principle to be closely observed by judicial organs. 
If cases are not handled in accordance with the Criminal 
Procedure Law or punishment is not administered in accordance 
with the criminal law, then we will not be able to assert the 
sanctity of law enforcement and we are liable to render unjust 
verdicts. In both cases, the defendants were pronounced not 
guilty on the grounds that they both refused to admit guilt, in 
obvious violation of Article 35 of the Criminal Procedure Law, 
which stipulates that emphasis should be placed on reliable 
evidence of the facts of a crime. Such erroneous judgments must 
be reversed according to law. What is thought-provoking about 
the cases is that while the facts of the crimes remained 
unchanged, Wei Guofan (defendant in one of the cases) was 
pronounced not guilty in disregard of the procedures prescribed 
in the Criminal Procedure Law; in the second case, a decision 
that placed the interests of a locality or a department above 
state laws was made, whereby Yan Changchun -- the defendant -- 
was absolved of any guilt and the case was publicized in the 
press. It is indeed worrisome and puzzling. 
  As China's legal system is being amplified and refined day 
by 
day, law-breakers should not entertain the idea that they can 
get away with their crimes. The only way out for them is to 
admit guilt, submit themselves to the law, sincerely amend their 
ways, and turn over a new leaf. 
  To strictly enforce the law, we must correctly understand 
the scientific implications of "conducive to three causes." 
When looked upon from the partial interests of a locality or 
department, some of the cases are not harmful at all; they are 
rather beneficial. An offense, if it is not judged by state 
laws but rather judged from the viewpoint of local or 
departmental protectionism, would not be viewed as an offense 
but a merit. When looked upon from the viewpoint of national 
interests and from the efforts to improve party workstyle and 
build honest government, we can see that such conduct hurts the 
interests of other regions or sectors, corrupts the ranks of 
cadres, and severely tarnishes the image of the party and 
government. When viewed from the angle of facilitating the 
development of the national economy and consolidating the 
government of the people's democratic dictatorship in China, it 
would become clear that the true meaning of "conducive to three 
causes" lies in strict enforcement of state laws and scrupulous 
prosecution of such cases. 
  In the ongoing anticorruption struggle, judicial organs are 
dutybound to strictly enforce the law and relentlessly prosecute 
crimes. The people's procuratorates must give full rein to 
their role in supervising law enforcement, while the people's 
courts must pay more attention to supervising its administration 
of justice -- this is the only way to ensure correct law 
enforcement and safeguard the authority and sanctity of the law. 
In particular, we must uphold the principle that every wrong 
should be righted. Amendment should be made either when an 
innocent person is wrongly convicted or a guilty party is 
mistakenly acquitted. This would directly reflect the CPC 
Central Committee's resolve to crack down on corruption and have 
a direct impact in terms of the people's confidence in the 
anticorruption struggle. Whatever the cases, the judicial 
organs must take facts as the basis and law as the criterion, 
administer justice fairly and impartially, right every wrong 
that is made, and see to it that every case they have handled 
can stand the test of history. When this is done, they will be 
able to win the people's confidence, arouse the people's fervor 
for fighting corruption, and fully implement the CPC Central 
Committee's anticorruption plans.

<F P=106> ["Reference news" by Ming Tan (2494 2481): "Public Security </F>
Personnel in Guizhou Stage Strikes"] 
  [Text] The fact that the central authorities decreed that 
public security organs must not run economic entities has caused 
a strong response from public security organs. In mid-December 
1993, public security personnel in the cities of Guiyang, Zunyi, 
and Liupanshui of Guizhou province "staged work strikes" or 
"slowed down work." Over 200 public security policemen of 
Guiyang's public security bureau asked for leave collectively, 
and Zunyi's public security bureau had to stop work for one week 
due to a manpower shortage, while personnel of the Liupanshui's 
public security bureau went to present a petition to the 
provincial public security department, protesting against "fund 
shortages" and the "exclusion of bonuses." The fact that public 
security policemen take a passive attitude toward work has 
called for a series of countermeasures. Guizhou could not but 
send troops in the place of policemen for patrol purposes. The 
Ministry of Public Security sent an investigation group to 
Guizhou on 24 December.

<F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Police Death Toll Hits 275"] </F>
  [Text] Officials announced yesterday that 275 police 
officers were killed and more than 8,120 sustained injuries on 
duty last year. 
  This testified to the heroism of the public security forces 
which safeguard people's lives and economic progress, Public 
Security Minister Tao Siju said. 
  Currently, China's police force has about one million 
officers. 
  More than 1,400 on duty police officers were killed and 
nearly 40,000 others received injuries since 1988, the minister 
said. 
  Analysts say that Chinese police now face more risks because 
criminals have started to arm themselves with weapons to resist 
police arrests, giving rise to armed clashes and casualties. 
  Statistics from the Public Security Ministry show that 
during 
the first 11 months last year, cases of armed violence rose 52.6 
per cent over the same period in 1992. 
  Police handled more than 1.5 million criminal cases and 
arrested more than 1 million offenders for all 1993. 
  They also helped combat 146 major fires that burnt 
factories, 
commercial buildings, entertainment centres and oil storage 
tanks in Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai and other cities. 
  Tao spoke at the third-annual ceremony held by his ministry 
yesterday honouring the nation's 100 best public security 
bureaus and 1,000 outstanding police officers. 
  It hopes to encourage Chinese police to further safeguard 
lives and promote economic progress, reforms and opening-up. 
  While praising these branch bureaus and policemen for their 
achievements, Tao also outlined four major tasks facing police 
this year: protecting political and social stability, severely 
cracking down on criminal offenders, wiping out social evils and 
expanding police teams. 
  At the ceremony, the honoured branch bureaus and policemen 
received cash awards in addition to written citations. 
  Each of the 100 best bureaus was awarded 10,000 yuan 
($1,150). While 22 of them, those receiving the honour for the 
third time, received 20,000 yuan ($2,300) each.

  [Text] Beijing, February 2 (XINHUA) -- China's frontier 
police handled 827 smuggling cases in the coastal regions and 
border areas in the past year. 
  These included 201 cases involving more than 1 millon yuan 
in 
value each. 
  According to sources at the Ministry of Public Security, the 
total value of all the smuggled goods reached .5 [as received] 
billion yuan. The smuggled goods included automobiles, 
electronic appliances and cigarettes. The smuggling ativities 
were most widespread in the coastal regions. The public 
security department took effective measures to enhance control 
of vessels at sea. 
  Last year 706 vessels engaged in smuggling were seized by 
the 
public security organizations in coastal regions and 273 vessels 
which had no numbers, no names and no registration documents 
were caught along the coastlines of Guandong, Fujian and 
Zhejiang Provinces.

<F P=106> [Article by Hua Ding (5478 0002): "Far From Being Over..."] </F>
  [Text] The title of this article comes from the subhead of 
a report carried by GUANGDONG GONGAN BAO. This title implies a 
great price; it is a title formed by the blood of 84 young 
working boys and girls. A big fire at Zhili Craft Manufacturing 
Factory in Shenzhen's Kuiyong swallowed these young people. 
  The big fire, which broke out on 19 November 1993, caused 
the 
largest number of death by a fire in Guangdong in more than a 
decade. The red flames have already burned everything to debris, 
and the workers who were wronged and driven to death cannot live 
again, while a series of problem caused by the big fire are far 
from being over. 
  The big fire started at 1325 in a stack of cloth in a 
workshop on the first floor of the factory, and it burned for 
three hours. It was lunch time and some 300 workers were on 
duty. Why did it turn into a tragedy which shocked people at 
home and abroad? The investigation report by the relevant 
department shows that it was a incident of serious 
responsibility in which a Hong Kong investor ignored regulations 
and the workers' safety, and made them work in risky conditions. 
A newspaper in Hong Kong also commented: "The Hong Kong boss 
cares about only earning money, not about the lives and safety 
of workers," and "it was 10 percent a natural disaster, and 90 
percent a misfortune created by man." 
  First, the Hong Kong businessman violated laws and 
regulations in putting the production workshop and warehouse 
together under the same roof of a factory building. 
  Second, he did not report the fire prevention plan of the 
factory to Shenzhen's fire department. According to 
information, the cargo elevator shaft originally designed by the 
factory was an open style, which resembled a big chimney and 
failed to meet the requirement of fire prevention; the fire 
department rejected the plan after an examination and asked the 
factory to come up with a new plan. But the boss did not 
comply; he ignored the workers' safety, and built and used the 
elevator without authorization. At the east and west ends on 
the second and third floors of the factory were staircases, 
which could be used to evacuate the workers in case of 
emergency, but the boss blocked these exists with sliding doors 
which he locked in order to supervise workers and safeguard 
stockpiles. Only the staircase at the west end was left open 
for use; among the four exits on the first floor, three were 
locked, and only the one facing the west was left unlocked for 
use. Therefore, when the fire broke out on the first floor, in 
just a few minutes the poisonous gases caused by the burning of 
polyurethane foam, acrylic fiber, and cotton flannel, were 
sufficient to poison and suffocate the workers who tried to 
escape through a crowded long and narrow passage which was only 
0.8 meter wide. 
  Third, as early as 9 March last year, the city's fire 
department issued a notice to the factory reminding it of the 
serious potential fire hazards inside the factory, and 
suggesting 13 improvement measures, which the notice said should 
be implemented in one month's time. The Hong Kong businessman 
implemented only six of the measures, and used improper means to 
acquire a qualifying certificate which said the factory met the 
standards upon examination of possible fire hazards. He just 
stalled. The Chinese factory manager, who was responsible for 
supervisory duties including fire prevention, not only failed to 
stop the law-breaking behavior of the Hong Kong businessman, but 
helped him to acquire the qualifying certificate through 
trickery. The governor of the town also came out personally to 
"say some good words," exerting pressure on the fire department. 
  Just these three points are sufficient to cause many doubts 
which puzzle the people and provoke thought. Why did the Hong 
Kong businessman dare to turn a blind eye to the government's 
laws and regulations? What was the reason for the Hong Kong 
businessman to consistently ignore the safety of the workers? 
For what reasons did the Chinese manager of the factory help 
the Hong Kong businessman to practice fraud and the governor of 
Kuiyong to "say some good words" for him? Has criminal 
responsibility of the fire been looked into? Have problems 
relating to the relevant Chinese personnel been looked into? 
Should the local government department and trade union be held 
responsible? What is the lesson to be learned? How should we 
manage foreign-funded enterprises according to law? How can the 
rights and interests of workers in foreign-funded enterprises be 
protected? Questions such as these show that there are a lot of 
things we should do but have not done. The lesson is a long 
story. 
  What must be noted is that the big fire at this craft 
factory 
was not an isolated phenomenon. Before that, fires had broken 
out in foreign-funded enterprises in Shenzhen, Fuzhou, Dongguan, 
and other places, causing deaths and serious injuries. In 
addition, according to the investigation by a relevant 
department, within foreign-funded enterprises, there have often 
been serious infringements upon the legitimate rights and 
interests of workers, such as lack of the minimum safety and 
work protection equipment in workplaces, frequent industrial 
accidents, insulting and swearing at staff and workers, 
compulsory overtime work, and random deduction and embezzlement 
of workers' wages. All these incidents are calling: It is time 
to pay attention to strengthening management of foreign-funded 
enterprises. 
  The open-door policy is a long-term policy in our country. 
In more than a decade, our country has opened the door widely, 
and eagerly welcomed investors from outside the border to 
establish enterprises on the mainland; the country has also 
diligently improved the investment environment and provided 
convenient conditions, and treated investors with courtesy. 
However, foreign businessmen must abide by China's laws and 
regulations, including the laws and regulations on labor safety, 
and operate according to law, then they can be protected. If 
they turn a blind eye to China's laws and regulations, ignore 
workers' safety, and even do whatever they want to the extent of 
causing serious incidents, then the persons to be held 
responsible can hardly avoid being blamed. When Chinese staff 
and workers work in foreign-funded enterprises, their political 
and economic rights and interests are protected by our country's 
constitution and laws; showing respect to the legitimate rights 
and interests and social status of Chinese staff and workers 
according to law is the wise and correct choice to be made by 
investors from outside the border.

<F P=106> ["Earnestly Study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of </F>
Deng Xiaoping column by Cheng Weili (4453 0251 4409): 
"Three Major Issues Regarding the Building of Spiritual 
Civilization In the Context of Market Economy"] 
  [Text] The practice of reform aimed at establishing and 
perfecting the socialist market economic system has once again 
highlighted the issue of building socialist market economy as a 
major task facing us. The concept of "doing two types of work 
simultaneously with equal strength" requires us to think 
creatively about the ideological and cultural betterment in the 
spiritual civilization in the context of market economy and 
explore, through practice, a new mental approach to avoiding the 
mistake of giving unequal attention to the two types of work. 
In conjunction with studying Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, I would like to share my personal 
understanding on three issues regarding the building of 
spiritual civilization in the context of market economy. 
<H3>  I. Reorientation of the Building of Spiritual Civilization 
in the Context of Market Economy </H3>
  In the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
(1975-1982), Comrade Xiaoping, in analyzing the building of 
spiritual civilization, suggested dividing it into two levels, 
namely, the level of ideological betterment and that of cultural 
betterment; he proposed that the objective of the building of 
spiritual civilization is to bring up a new generation of people 
with "four qualities," i.e., lofty ideals, moral integrity, 
education, and a sense of discipline; and he emphasized that 
ideological betterment is more important than cultural 
betterment. Among the "four qualities" to be cultivated, he set 
greater store by the education in ideals and discipline. From 
the point of view of historical materialism, he paid close 
attention to the material basis for the building of spiritual 
civilization. He emphasized that spiritual civilization 
originates from material civilization in the final analysis, 
while calling for due attention to the building of spiritual 
civilization when the productive forces are being emancipated 
and developed. Thereupon, he put forward the principle of 
"doing two types of work simultaneously with equal strength." 
  Since the 12th and 13th CPC National Congresses, we have 
looked upon the building of spiritual civilization as one of the 
basic features of socialism. With the constant deepening of the 
reform and opening up, while continuously broadening his mental 
approach to the relationship between socialism and the market 
economy and making it more specific, Comrade Xiaoping has also 
continuously increased the ideological strength of his 
expositions on the building of spiritual civilization and, in 
time, attained a new ideological realm. We should pay due 
attention to this point and conduct longitudinal study on it. 
  In his speech delivered at the national party conference on 
23 September 1985, he once again emphasized that the whole party 
should pay close attention to the building of spiritual 
civilization and clearly pointed out: "If the building of 
spiritual civilization is not strengthened, the building of 
material civilization will suffer and make a detour." 
  At the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing 
Committee meeting on 17 January 1986, he pointed out in his 
speech that in conducting the building of spiritual civilization 
and striving to improve the party conduct and the general mood 
of society, it is imperative to make strenuous and consistent 
efforts on a daily basis and start from specific matters. He 
said emphatically: "If the general mood of society continues to 
deteriorate, what is the point of a successful economy? It will 
become degenerate in another way which will, in turn, cause the 
entire economy to go bad. If things are going this way, society 
will become a world of corruption, theft, and bribery." 
  In his talks made during his inspection tour in southern 
China in January 1992, Comrade Xiaoping elevated the building of 
spiritual civilization to an unprecedented theoretical level and 
tackled the issue in terms of a theoretical definition of the 
nature of socialism. In an earnest tone, he admonished us: 
"Whether or not the Chinese affairs can be handled well... in 
a sense, depends on men.... If anything goes wrong in China, it 
will be within the Communist Party." "It is necessary to combat 
corruption in the entire process of the reform and opening up... 
the building of a clean and honest administration should be 
taken care of as an important task." He specially emphasized 
the importance of doing two types of work simultaneously with 
equal strength. Not only should the economy be boosted, social 
order and the general mood of society should also be improved. 
The building of both civilizations should surpass that of 
capitalism. "Nothing but this is socialism with Chinese 
characteristics." 
  A different approach to this issue may lead us to the same 
conclusion. Comrade Xiaoping defined the nature of socialism as 
"emancipating the productive forces, developing the productive 
forces, eradicating exploitation, eliminating polarization, and 
eventually realizing common prosperity." In a conversation with 
a number of comrades in charge of the CPC Central Committee on 
24 December 1990, Comrade Xiaoping said: "We should not 
consider practicing a little bit of market economy as following 
the capitalist road. That is not true. We should have both 
planning and market." Then he immediately pointed out: "How 
the coastal regions may help the inland regions is a big issue. 
Reaching common prosperity will some day become the central 
topic." Obviously, common prosperity should be a "central 
topic" in the process of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics in the context of market economy. Without 
sustained efforts in the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization, there will be no desired objective of common 
prosperity to speak of and the nature of socialism will not be 
able to materialize either. Only by understanding the issue and 
reevaluating the theoretical positioning of the building of 
spiritual civilization in the theoretical structure of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics can we have an 
ideological premise and basis for understanding in our effort to 
overcome the stereotyped mentality of emphasizing one type of 
work at the expense of the other. Theoretically speaking, 
socialist spiritual civilization is not just one of the features 
of socialism. It is a fundamental manifestation and concrete 
requirement of the nature of socialism in the spirit of men. 
<H3>  II. Support Operations For the Spiritual Motive Force System 
in the Context of Market Economy </H3>
  Under the new situation whereby the reform and opening up 
are 
making overall advances and the pace of modernization is 
quickening, there has been a significant expansion in, and a 
major contribution to, Comrade Xiaoping's thinking on the 
building of spiritual civilization. That is, after summing up 
the past experience, he put forward the new concept of a 
"spiritual motive force for the development of China." 
  When meeting with Japanese friends on 30 June 1984, he made 
this synoptic remark: "If we were not Marxists, did not have 
full conviction in Marxism, or had not integrated Marxism with 
China's own reality and followed our own road, the Chinese 
Revolution would not have been successful and China would to 
this day still be rent by disunity. There would have been no 
independence or unity. Our conviction in Marxism is a spiritual 
motive force for the success of the Chinese Revolution." Here, 
he clearly put forward the concept of "spiritual motive force." 
  At the national party conference on 23 September 1985, he 
again said: "If we only had material conditions, our revolution 
and construction would not have succeeded. In the past, no 
matter how weak our party was and no matter what difficulties we 
came across, we always had a strong fighting capacity because we 
had conviction in Marxism and communism. The common aspiration 
resulted in iron discipline. This was, is, and will be our true 
superiority." He especially pointed out with emphasis: "Some 
comrades are no longer so clear about this truth, so it is hard 
for them to pay attention to the building of spiritual 
civilization." Here, Comrade Xiaoping was summing up 
history with reference to specific issues. He was trying to find 
the nucleus of the spiritual motive force from within the true 
superiority of our party, believing that the conviction in 
Marxism is a kind of spiritual motive force. 
  When meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone on 9 
November 1986, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "According to my 
long-term experience in political and military activity, I think 
the most important thing is the unity of people and unity 
entails common aspirations and firm conviction." Comrade 
Xiaoping set great store by the human factor but what he 
emphasized was not the awakening of those whose "innermost soul 
goes through an outbreak of revolution;" instead, he emphasized 
"those with firm conviction who recognize the people's own 
interests and fight for them." In his opinion, the only way is 
"to unite the people with a firm conviction and fight for the 
people's own interests. Without such a conviction, there would 
be no cohesiveness. Without such a conviction, there would be 
nothing." From Comrade Xiaoping's point of view, the firm 
conviction of fighting for the people's interests is a principle 
of the building of spiritual civilization in the new era and a 
cornerstone of the spiritual motive force system. "This is 
China's own characteristic" and also an example of his 
application of historical materialism. 
  It was for the purpose of creating a spiritual motive force 
system which conforms to the reform, opening up, and market 
economy that Comrade Xiaoping has been energetically advocating 
the patriotic spirit of invigorating the Chinese nation and 
increasing the cohesiveness of the nation. He said: "I am a 
Chinese and know the history of foreign aggression in China... 
...should know something about Chinese history. This is a 
spiritual motive force for the development of China." The 
reason Comrade Xiaoping included patriotism in spiritual 
civilization is because patriotism and socialism are 
intrinsically consistent with each other. When some people 
argued that not loving socialism does not mean not loving the 
country, Comrade Xiaoping sharply refuted such an argument and 
said: "Is the motherland an abstract concept? If you do not 
love the socialist New China led by the Communist Party, what do 
you love then?" In his opinion, promoting patriotic spirit is 
very necessary for the enhancement of national self-respect and 
national confidence under the circumstances of reform and 
opening up. "Or else we would not be able to build socialism 
and would be corroded and corrupted by all kinds of capitalist 
forces." Thus it can be seen that patriotism is another 
cornerstone for the establishment of a spiritual motive force 
system and is a brilliant example of Comrade Xiaoping's 
successful integration of socialist conviction with China's 
cultural tradition. 
  Besides, Comrade Xiaoping also pays close attention to the 
comprehensive development of the spiritual motive force system 
in the context of market economy. Market economy is by nature a 
legal economy. In view of the fact that people lack an adequate 
awareness of law in their actual everyday life, Comrade Xiaoping 
pointed out: "Legal awareness is connected to people's level of 
education. Today, so many young people commit crime... one of 
the reasons is that their level of education is too low." 
Therefore, he suggested "education in law should start from 
kids...." As to how spiritual civilization can materialize in 
material civilization, Comrade Xiaoping very much emphasized the 
building of civilization system as an intermediary link. On the 
one hand, he firmly believes that "only socialism can eliminate 
all phenomena of greed, corruption, and injustice which are 
natural products of capitalism and other systems of 
exploitation"; on the other hand, he sets great store by and 
emphasizes the need to "continue to make and improve various 
regimes and laws which conform with socialist principles." This 
way, Comrade Xiaoping linked up spiritual civilization with 
material civilization through a civilization system by 
discussing the awareness of law, level of education, and regimes 
and laws; he subsequently considered market economy, the 
building of legal system, and the building of spiritual 
civilization as a great social systems engineering project, 
presenting the strategic construct of integrating market economy 
with the building of spiritual civilization. 
<H3>  II. Results and Methods of Building Spiritual Civilization 
in the Context of Market Economy </H3>
  As early as the national party conference on 23 September 
1985, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "The formulation of 
building socialist spiritual civilization was set out a long 
time ago." "But in terms of the whole country, the results are 
less than ideal up to this day. The main problem is that the 
whole party has failed to pay earnest attention to it." 
  At the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing 
Committee meeting on 17 January 1986, Comrade Xiaoping again 
pointed out: "Take hold of typical cases and handle them so that 
the effect will be significant and will indicate that we are 
determined to overcome all obstacles to conduct the building of 
legal system and spiritual civilization." He suggested the 
secretariat "make strenuous efforts for two years and score good 
results." He said: "If we make a good job of this matter, we 
will be able to truly promote reform and construction. We 
should be determined to do this and struggle for at least 10 
years... 10 years is the time needed to bring up a person!" 
  Comrade Xiaoping's idea of attaching importance to results 
in 
building spiritual civilization deserves our attention. It is 
because of this idea of attaching importance to actual results 
that he relatively values the experience of Singapore in 
building spiritual civilization and this is consistent with his 
approach of "boldly absorbing and assimilating all the fruits of 
civilization created by human society." In the talks he made 
during his tour of southern China in 1992, he said: "The social 
order in Singapore is rather good. They keep a tight control. 
We should draw upon their experience and exercise even better 
control than them." At the moment, there are two 
interpretations of the orientation of Singapore's experience, 
one tending toward absorbing Confucianist ethics and the other 
tending toward absorbing the Western style of rule of law. In 
fact, Singapore's Confucianist ethics have been analyzed and 
processed by the modern neo-Confucianist theory in the West, not 
a simplistic interpretation of the original Confucianism; and 
their rule of law is integrated with the spirit of "rule of 
ethics" found in the tradition of the Chinese. We need to 
digest and screen their experience instead of copying it in a 
simplistic way. Attention must be given to the results in the 
process of such assimilation. We should "choose and follow what 
is good" and aim at "exercising even better control than them." 
At the same time, we should boldly experiment and reform in the 
process of practice. 
  On 23 October 1985, when answering a question raised by the 
editor-in-chief of America's Time Company on the means to solve 
a handful of embezzlement, corruption, and power abuse cases, 
Comrade Xiaoping clearly said that we mainly resort to two 
means: "One is education, the other is law." Education and law, 
as two important means for the building of spiritual 
civilization, are mutually complementary and neither is 
dispensable. There are some problems concerning the building of 
spiritual civilization which cannot be solved overnight and 
results cannot possibly be achieved simply with a few words from 
somebody. It takes determination, stamina, and constancy of 
purpose to gradually overcome, and eventually eliminate, these 
negative phenomena. 
  On the specific methodology for building spiritual 
civilization, Comrade Xiaoping also has a series of unequivocal 
statements. Some comrades asked what the immediate significance 
of studying Marxist theory is. Comrade Xiaoping's reply showed 
an analytical attitude. On the one hand, he pointed out that 
this question shows a misunderstanding. Marxist theory has 
never been a dogma but is a guide to action. The main task for 
us is to hold on more to principles and be more systematic, 
farsighted, and creative; learn to explore and solve the new 
basic problems in politics, economics, social affairs, and 
culture in a dynamic way; and avoid losing our bearings in the 
complex struggles. On the other hand, he pointed out that 
Marxism is not abstruse. Marxism is a very simple and unadorned 
theory. The things we learn from Marxism-Leninism should be 
essential and practical. 
  As to some specific methods and policy orientation in the 
process of building spiritual civilization in the context of 
market economy, Comrade Xiaoping also has a series of clearly 
defined principles. For instance, he pointed out that the 
tendency to "put money before everything" and commercializing 
spiritual products has found expression in other aspects of 
spiritual production. "Some of those who are unworthy to occupy 
a place among artists, publishers, and relics researchers have 
simply turned into moneygrubbing merchants." He also pointed 
out: "Ideological, cultural, educational, and public health 
departments should take social benefit as the sole criterion for 
all their activities. The enterprises subordinate to them 
should also take social benefit as the highest criterion. The 
ideological and cultural circles should produce a larger 
quantity of good spiritual products and firmly stop the 
production, import, and spreading of bad products." The thrust 
of all these remarks does indeed provide food for thought. We 
should earnestly consider if it still suits the building of 
today's cultural market. 
  We believe that as long as we can keep developing our 
productive forces, maintain a certain economic growth rate, and 
consistently do two types of work simultaneously with equal 
strength, boldly and skillfully, then we will be able to 
overcome and redress the phenomenon of making unbalanced efforts 
in the two types of work. Under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we 
are bound to be able to upgrade the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization.

Lebin (0702 2867 2430)] 
  [Excerpt] Beijing, 29 Dec (XINHUA) -- The 1994 Work 
Conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences closed today. Li 
Peng, premier of the State Council, sent a congratulatory letter. 
  The congratulatory letter states: Basically speaking, we 
need 
to rely on scientific and technological progress to realize our 
country's socialist modernization. The broad mass of scientists 
and technical workers shoulder a glorious yet arduous historical 
mission. It is my earnest hope that the broad mass of 
scientists and technical workers will, following the close of 
the conference, further implement the guidelines set forth at 
the 14th CPC National Congress and at the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee; deepen reform of the 
scientific and technical structure; constantly promote 
scientific and technical progress in line with the scientific 
and technological development trend in the world and in 
integrating with the reality in our country; and make even 
greater contributions to the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of our country's economy. 
  Li Peng also states the following in his letter: As the 
Spring Festival, the traditional festival of the Chinese people, 
is approaching, I would like to wish you in advance a happy new 
year. Through you, I would also like to wish a happy new year in 
advance to all comrades throughout the nation who work hard on 
the scientific and technological front. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, Feburary 3 ( XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, visited Qian Xuesen, China's 
greatest aerospace scientist, at his home in a Beijing suburb 
today. 
  Li, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee, gave 
Lunar New Year greetings to the 82-year-old scientist on behalf 
of top Chinese leaders. 
  Li praised the scientist for his outstanding contributions 
to 
the development of China's scientific research, especially to 
foundation of the country's space technology. Li also praised 
Qian's achievement in social science studies. 
  Qian enjoys international fame as a key figure in the 
development of rockets and missiles. 
  Li said that China's decision-making system is expected to 
be 
more scientific and democratic, because social progress can 
neither be separated from natural science development nor can it 
be independent of the scientific decision-making system. 
  He hoped that Qian will make more proposals to help improve 
the system. 
  The scientist felt happy to see a new generation of 
scientific workers growing up and surpassing their senior 
co-workers in research work.

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "State Plans for a Green China"] </F>
  [Text] The government will implement a five-year 
environmental clean-up plan in pursuit of a "Green China", the 
National Environmental Protection Work Conference was told 
yesterday. 
  Industrial waste treatment will be improved and biological 
diversity will be protected. 
  Legislation will be hurried through to oversee the 
production 
of materials which deplete the ozone layer and control the trade 
in poisonous chemicals. 
  And international environmental conventions will be 
respected 
by the plan. 
  The measures for cleaning up an ever more polluted China are 
part of a National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) 
programme which will run up to 1998. 
  The World Bank, the Asia Development Bank and global 
environmental foundations will be asked to help finance domestic 
waste control projects. 
  And legislation for the control of waste transfer across 
borders will be introduced. 
  Nature reserves will be expanded to cover 8 per cent of 
China's total land area under NEPA plans to protect biological 
diversity. 
  About 80 per cent of the country's industrial waste water 
will be treated by 1998. At the moment only about 68 per cent 
is being treated. 
  And five year targets have been set for the treatment of 
industrial waste gas and solid refuse. 
  Nearly 88 per cent of gas will be treated, compared to the 
current 79 per cent. And 45 per cent of solid waste will be 
processed by 1998, compared to 1993's figure of just under 40 
per cent. 
  A pilot project to develop environment-friendly agriculture 
in 50 counties will be run by NEPA in co-ordination with seven 
State departments. 
  Local governments will use a carrot and stick approach to 
tighten up on the treatment of industrial pollutants. 
  Waste discharge licences will be necessary, and 
"environmental symbols" will be awarded to pollution-free 
products. 
  The country's environment has become a lot worse over the 
last few years, especially in the mushrooming cities, according 
to the Nepa report. 
  It is hoped that implementation of the programme will 
prevent 
further environmental deterioration and lead to a clean, 
beautiful and pollution-free China. 
  Environmental pollution and ecological damage have impeded 
China's reforms and hindered its foreign relations. 
  Products and facilities that consume excessive energy or 
poison the environment will be banned. 
  Nepa will regularly update the public on the environment. 
And 10 model ecology projects will be built. 
  The central government also plans to launch a "Green China" 
programme to crack down on industrial and urban pollution. 
  China's environment has suffered from the economic boom. In 
some places, energy and raw material have been consumed with 
complete disregard for environmental damage. 
  And there is widespread ignorance of State laws and 
regulations on environmental protection. 
  Some local governments just don't have the clout to enforce 
the current safeguards, according to Nepa. 
  NEPA warned that the coming five ears are crucial for the 
country if it is to establish adequate environmental protection 
for the 21st century.

  [Text] Beijing, February 4 (XINHUA) -- China will 
consistently crack down on illegal pollution and destruction of 
the environment -- this year and in years to come, a senior 
Chinese leader said today. 
  Song Jian, state councillor and director of the Environment 
Protection Committee of the State Council, made the remarks here 
today at the closing ceremony of a national conference on 
environment protection work. 
  Song said his committee will focus on inspecting how well 
the 
environment laws and regulations are observed this year. 
  "Those who break the environmental laws and regulations, 
irrespective of their positions, will shoulder the legal 
responsibility," Song said. 
  Song said the government officials will not only be judged 
in 
terms of economic results but also their achievements in 
carrying out the environmental laws and improving the 
environment. 
  What he termed "major and important cases" of destruction of 
the environment will be fully investigated and handled according 
to law, Song said. 
  The state councillor said the environment pollution has been 
more and more severe in some areas, and disputes on environment 
pollution emerge from time to time. 
  Song said the National People's Congress and the State 
Council will jointly inspect the environment protection work in 
a dozen provinces this year. 
  Some of the polluters found will be obliged to improve 
substantially within a set time, others will be shut down, he 
said. 
  Especially rural enterprises will be further checked, he 
added, since some of them lack the money and expertise to 
control pollution, and thus bring more damage to the environment. 
  Song Jian said the role of mass organizations should also be 
brought into full play to protect the environment. 
  They should be encouraged to participate in this drive 
themselves, as well as to supervise the governmental work on 
protecting and improving the environment, he noted.

  [Text] Hangzhou, 31 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Another 
national-class fiber optic cable communication system--the 
Hangzhou (Fuzhou)-Guiyang-Chengdu trunk line--will be built in 
Zhejiang. Construction of the project will start in January and 
trial operation is scheduled in August next year. By that time, 
the province will have an additional 33,000 inter-and 
intra-provincial communication lines. 
  It has been reported that the project will run through three 
major regions--eastern, central south, and southwest China--and 
is an important component of the key fiber optic cable network 
to be built by the state during the Eighth Five-Year Plan 
period. The project starts from Hangzhou and Fuzhou in the 
east, passes through Jinhua, Quzhou, Shangrao, and Yingtan to 
reach Nanchang, and through Nanping and Fuzhou to reach 
Nanchang. The two lines merge into one in Nanchang and proceed 
to the destination of Chengdu via Changsha, Guiyang, and 
Chongqing. The overall length of the communication system is 
4,354 km with a total of 107 stations set up along the lines. 
The length within the boundary of Zhejiang Province will be 433 
km, and 10 stations will be set up in Hangzhou, Fuyang, Tonglu, 
Gantan, Jiande, Lanxi, Jinhua, Longyou, Quzhou, and Jiangshan.

<F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" column by staff reporter Ji Honggeng </F>
(6060 3126 6342): "Foreign Trade Volume Increases by Eight 
Times in the Past 15 Years"] 
  [Text] When you open "A Collection of Foreign Trade Data," 
you will see figures almost from the beginning to the end. 
Figures are boring, but also thought-provoking. 
  Do you know that we can trace back from 1949 to 1864, a year 
in which the British imperialists waged an Opium War and blew 
open China's door with big guns, and a year in which our 
country's total import and export volume was $286 million, of 
which the export volume was $147 million? 
  Eighty-five years later, it was 1949. Can you guess how much 
the total import and export volume had increased? It was only 
$52 million, less than 20 percent; whereas the diagram (below) 
[original item shows line graph with following information 
illustrated; unable to reproduce graph here] shows that from 
1949, when the country was liberated, to 1993, that is, in a 
period of 44 years, the volume rose from $340 million to $195.72 
billion, an increase of some 570 times. Judged from the 
absolute figures, the most rapid growth took place after the 
reform and opening up: In 1978, our country's total import and 
export volume was $20.64 billion; in 1993, the figure had 
increased by more than $175 billion over 15 years before. 
  The picture and diagram also show that the composition of 
our 
country's exports also changed markedly: In 1978, primary 
products accounted for more than half of the export volume [pie 
chart reflecting the "Composition of Exports" referred to as 
picture and diagram above indicates primary products accounted 
for 53.5 percent of the export volume while industrial products 
made up 46.5 percent of the total], whereas in 1993 they made up 
less than 20 percent of the export volume, that is to say, 
finished industrial products accounted for the great majority of 
our country's exports [second pie chart indicates industrial 
products accounted for 81.8 percent of 1993 exports while 
primary products made up 18.2 percent of the total.] 
  When we look at history we acquire new knowledge. Speaking 
in terms of foreign trade volume in the international community, 
in 1992, our country ranked 11th in the world (the statistics 
for 1993 are not yet available). Obviously, this result was 
hard-won, but for a big country with 1.1 billion people, we 
still have to catch up. Speaking in terms of composition of 
exports, we have just accomplished the first change from 
exporting large quantities of primary products to exporting 
mainly finished industrial products. The second change, that is, 
changing from exporting industrial products of low added value 
to exporting industrial products of high added value as much as 
possible, is still an arduous task. Someone has mentioned the 
following: Our country has exported 50 million pairs of shoes 
to a certain country, so everyone in that country has a pair of 
shoes, but the value of these 50 million pairs of shoes is less 
than that of two airbuses! 
  Here we can see that we still have to do a great deal of 
work.

<F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "Foreign Enterprises Set To Boom This Year"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign-funded enterprises, which reached a total 
of more than 140,000 last year, will continue to play a key role 
in boosting China's foreign trade this year, according to 
official sources. 
  But the growth of their imports led to a record trade 
deficit 
of $12.18 billion last year. 
  And this trend is expected to continue this year with a 
sharp 
increase in joint-venture imports, Chinese customs officials 
predicted yesterday. 
  The foreign-funded firms' trade volume is predicted to hit a 
record high of $94 billion this year, accounting for about 40 
per cent of the country's total expected trade. This compares 
with 34 per cent last year. 
  Equipment imported by the overseas ventures totalled a 
record 
$16.6 billion in 1993 and became the most important factor in 
China's trade deficit. 
  And equipment imports are likely to double this year to 
somewhere in excess of $34 billion, the Beijing-based General 
Administration of Customs (GAC) said yesterday. 
  The officials made it clear that the rate of overseas 
investment will increase now that China has unified its foreign 
exchange rate this year. 
  Investment will be cushioned against financial risk of the 
old market where hard currrency was sold at the low official 
rate sometimes and bought on the foreign exchange at the high 
swap market rate. 
  Meanwhile, overseas firms' exports are expected to grow more 
than 35 per cent this year to reach a total value of over $34 
billion. 
  But the increase of the overseas ventures' imports and 
exports will impose a major strain on China's efforts to improve 
its balance of payments this year. 
  And China's foreign exchange market, which is still weak 
because supply and demand are the same, is likely to be affected 
. 
  And the net import of funds over the last few years will 
swing round to a net export this year. The sharp increase in 
accumulated foreign business investment will mean an increase in 
the amount of hard currencies used by them to repay capital with 
interest. 
  Efforts to balance supply and demand in the foreign exchange 
market will be further impaired by the increasingly large 
remittances which will be sent abroad by overseas ventures this 
year.

  [Text] Beijing, February 4 (XINHUA) -- The foreign trade 
volume of China's foreign-funded enterprises is expected to 
reach 94 billion U.S. dollars this year, according to a recent 
official projection. 
  This means that the proportion of import and export trade of 
foreign-funded enterprises will rise to about 40 percent of the 
national total. 
  An official from the general office of the China customs 
said 
that exports of foreign-funded enterprises are expected to 
surpass 34 billion U.S. dollars, up 35 percent on last year, and 
imports may reach around 62 billion dollars, 50 percent more 
than in 1993. 
  China approved the establishment of 70,000 foreign-funded 
enterprises last year, about half the total set up by the end of 
1993. 
  These new enterprises will contribute to the projected 
growth 
of China's foreign trade, the official said. 
  Figures from the China customs showed that exports by 
China's 
foreign-funded companies reached 25.24 billion U.S. dollars last 
year, an increase of 45.4 percent or 7.88 billion U.S. dollars 
over 1992, accounting for 27.5 percent of the country's total as 
against only 20.5 percent in 1992. 
  Imports by these enterprises in 1993 were 41.83 billion U.S. 
dollars, 58.6 percent or 15.44 billion U.S. dollars more than in 
the previous year, accounting for 40.2 percent of China's total 
as against 32.8 percent in the year before.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 31 (XINHUA) -- The renminbi yuan 
closed at 8.6960 against the U.S. dollar today in the Shanghai 
Foreign Exchange Swap Center, the largest swap center in China. 
  Trading was heavy today, with 33.63 million U.S. dollars 
changing hands. 
  The amount of dollars traded in the center totaled 467 
million dollars in January, averaging 22.24 million dollars on 
each trading day -- up 39 percent over the same month in 1993. 
  Analysts agreed that the renminbi has been stable and 
trading 
has been brisk since exchange rates were unified at the 
beginning of this year. 
  Altogether, the Shanghai swap center had 21 trading days in 
January, with the yuan slipping gradually downward from the 
first trading day on January 3, they noted. 
  The yuan hit bottom at 8.6930 against the dollar, but stood 
there for just one day before picking up to 8.6970, which lasted 
for 14 trading days. 
  The yuan dipped again to 8.6960 in the last two trading days 
of January, they said. 
  Overall, the weighted average of renminbi fluctuated in a 
narrow range of 0.0059 yuan for the whole month. 
  According to analysts, the slight fluctuation indicates that 
the 8.7000 exchange rate of the yuan against the greenback is a 
price acceptable to both buyers and sellers. 
  Practice shows that the reform of China's foreign exchange 
system has been successful since the beginning of the year, to 
the welcome of both Chinese and foreign traders, one analyst 
noted. 
  In contrast, he recalled, the yuan stood at 7.7060 against 
the dollar on the first trading day of January 1993 and peaked 
at 8.3580. 
  Moreover, the weighted average of the Chinese currency 
fluctuated across a broad range of 0.5768 yuan in January 1993. 
  At that time, the yuan exchange rate registered steep ups 
and 
downs, while trading was moderate, with an average of 15.95 
million dollars changing hands on each trading day, analysts 
said. 
  In the new year, trading peaked at 34.95 million dollars on 
January 27, as against 25.62 million dollars in January 1993, 
they said. 
  However, they also warned against over-optimism, saying that 
it is still necessary to improve management and step up 
macro-economic controls in order to prevent the renminbi 
exchange rate from suffering sharp ups and downs. 
  Now, the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Swap Center has brokers 
representing 21 Chinese financial institutions and 22 foreign 
institutions. 
  In all, the center reported trading amounting to 5.29 
billion 
dollars for all of 1993, up 49 percent over the previous year.

  [Text] Shanghai, 31 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- 
Statistics recently published by relevant authorities here 
indicate that over 47,000 foreign exchange dealings were 
conducted at Shanghai Foreign Exchange Regulation Center in 
1993, the total volume of these transactions being $5.294 
billion, both figures representing over 30 percent increases 
when compared with the previous year. 
  Analysts in the monetary sector observed the following 
characteristics of the foreign exchange transactions in Shanghai 
last year: 
  1. There was a boom of member brokers at the foreign 
exchange 
regulation center, from 15 at the time of founding to more than 
40. Half of them are foreign financial institutions. A number 
of foreign banks carried out transactions at the center. 
  2. The volume of transactions in which Chinese and foreign 
member brokers represent clients to participate in foreign 
exchange trading exceeded the volume of transactions conducted 
between dealers themselves, thus playing a mainstay role in the 
exchange market. 
  3. Spot exchange dealings took up a large proportion in the 
total volume of transactions. 
  4. Though the exchange market price experienced big 
fluctuations, the rate stabilized at around one U.S. dollar to 
8.70 yuan starting last August. According to statistics, last 
year's weighted mean was one U.S. dollar to 8.7207 yuan. 
  5. Investing enterprises from abroad sold more exchange than 
they bought. 
  6. The foreign exchange regulation market supplied 85 
percent of the exchange used for import and export nationwide. 
Shanghai had a 20 percent share of this market. 
  Members of the monetary sector pointed out: In a short space 
of five years after the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Regulation 
Center was founded, its annual transaction volume rose from $730 
million to nearly 5.3 billion. This shows a strong growth 
momentum. They were convinced that with the opening of China 
Foreign Exchange Transaction Center in Shanghai in the near 
future, Shanghai's foreign exchange dealings will be more active 
and mature.

<F P=106> ["Special Dispatch": "Central Leader Urges Keeping </F>
Inflation Rate Below 10 Percent"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (TA KUNG PAO)--A central leader, 
while emphasizing recently the need to strengthen agriculture, 
which serves as the foundation of the national economy, said 
great efforts must be made to keep the 1994 inflation rate below 
10 percent. 
  The leader said: The year 1994 is a year of crucial 
importance, because in this year many reform measures will be 
introduced. We must handle well the relationship between reform 
and development on the one hand and stability on the other and 
maintain a stable political environment and a favorable economic 
environment. Price reform will be carried out at a faster pace, 
but the inflation rate should be kept below 10 percent. To 
achieve this, we must first of all stabilize agricultural 
production and ensure a plentiful supply of agricultural and 
sideline products. The tolerance of the general population must 
be taken into account when prices are adjusted. Therefore, it is 
necessary to strengthen agriculture, which serves as the 
foundation of the national economy, and improve our work in 
rural areas. We must never relax for one bit on agricultural 
production even under the conditions when the agricultural 
situation is good; as our tasks become tougher, there will be 
all the more need for us to put agriculture in the first place 
of our economic work. 
  The leader pointed out: In adjusting the economic structure, 
we must strike a balance between industry and agriculture, which 
are two major sectors of the national economy, and increase the 
proportion of agriculture in the economy. This concerns not 
only agriculture but also industry. Industry is not plagued by 
a lack of funds but by overstocking of products. The biggest 
market is in the countryside. If the rural market cannot be 
activated, the industrial foundation will become shaky and the 
market as a whole will shrink. Therefore, we must adjust the 
structure in terms of finance, capital construction, and other 
aspects.

<F P=106> [By Kent Chen] </F>
  [Text] The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will set up a 
multi-billion dollar payment system for interbank settlements 
linking all of its branches as part of efforts to boost the role 
of the mainland central bank. The giant network will be a big 
step in the modernisation of China's banking system, which will 
see sweeping changes this year, featuring the transformation of 
state-owned banks into commercial banks and the establishment of 
policy-oriented banks. 
  The first phase of the modernisation has received a loan 
from 
the World Bank and the bidding documents for the system are 
expected to be released in about three weeks. About 30 major 
international computer manufacturers are expected to take part 
in the bidding, which will open opportunities for more business 
in China's financial sector. The selection will be held in two 
stages, with the winning bid picked at the end of this year. 
The winner of the contract will be responsible for supplying 
the equipment, developing a software system and building a 
communications network. 
  Colin Shun, deputy general manager of Beijing Chibo 
Information Engineering, a joint venture between CL Computers 
China/Hong Kong, the People's Bank and five other Chinese banks, 
said a lot of inquiries had been received in the past six 
months. "We believe all major international computer 
manufacturers will bid for the contract," he said. 
  The joint venture was set up to develop a modern financial 
system for banks in China, and is charged with the 
responsibility of compiling the bidding documents of the first 
phase of the payment system. Mr Shun said the World Bank loan 
was sufficient for the pilot project, and the Government had 
committed to cover the additional expenses incurred. 
  The whole project involves the design, development and 
installation of a nationwide computer-cum-communications system 
to process the bulk of funds transfers in China. This will 
upgrade the country's payment system to the standard of the 
Fedwire and ACH systems in the United States and CHAPS in 
Britain. "Such a system is indispensable in the current drive 
for economic reforms in China. It would allow transfer of funds 
within the country to be done in the shortest possible time," Mr 
Shun said. 
  "Before an automatic payment system is introduced into the 
banking sector for the transfer of funds, the flow of money has 
to be made using telegraph, mail or telephone. This is not 
reliable nor efficient," he said. "The Chinese payment system, 
to be called the Chinese National Financial Network, is a huge 
undertaking in the eyes of both the Chinese and foreign 
financial sectors," he added. 
  China believes it will take 10 more years to link up all 
2,500 branches of the People's Bank in the country. Although 
the current organisation of the bank might be revamped as it 
transforms into a true central bank, the proposed network is 
based on the existing structure of the bank. "The objective is 
to put all the PBOC branches under the umbrella of the payment 
system as soon as possible," said Mr Shun. 
  Other mainland banks might link up with the PBOC network, 
but 
that is outside the scope of the current project. He said it 
was unlikely that China's payment system could simply copy the 
existing systems in the West and Japan. "China's banking system 
is different, so the Chinese network has to be established from 
scratch." he said. 
  It is still not known how China will finance the rest of the 
project after the first phase is completed in two to three 
years. CL Computers, as adviser in the project, is not allowed 
to bid for the contract to avoid conflict of interest. 
  Alphonso Fung, executive director of CL Computers, said the 
company took a long-term view of the China market. "By playing 
an important role in the computerisation of the banking sector 
in China, it will help sell our products in future. This is a 
long-term investment," he said.

  [Text] Chengdu, 31 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The 
national conference of price inspection office directors, 
concluded here the other day, reported that from January through 
November 1993, a total of 220,000 cases of price-related illegal 
practices and cases were handled nationwide. 
  According to the information, the illicit gain reaped 
through 
unlawful price increases discovered last year totaled 353 
million yuan, of which 87 million yuan was refunded. 
  The conference emphasized that the prices of people's daily 
necessities and charges for various kinds of services will 
become the main objects of inspection in the coming year. At 
present, inspection of the prices of grain, oil, meat, eggs, and 
vegetables should be well conducted and such irregularities as 
jacking up prices, seeking exorbitant profits, and disrupting 
market prices must be firmly handled. Unauthorized price 
increases and charges for railway, highway, and water 
transportation and forcing customers to buy insurance when 
selling or handling various kinds of tickets should also be 
dealt with according to law.

<F P=106> ["China's Agricultural Development Program for the </F>
Nineties-- Deliberated On and Adopted by the Seventh Executive 
Meeting of the State Council on 20 August 1993"] 
  [Text] Agriculture is the foundation for economic 
development, social stability, and national independence. 
Constantly giving top priority to agricultural development and 
invigorating the rural economy in all fields is a matter of 
major importance concerning the overall situation. In the 
eighties, remarkable achievements were made in our country's 
agriculture and the major breakthroughs made in the following 
six aspects created favorable conditions for the acceleration of 
reform and opening and the accelerated development of the 
national economy. 
  --Agricultural operations broke through the long-standing 
old 
pattern of unified management under a large public ownership 
system. The double-tiered management system, based mainly on the 
household output contract system adopted since the beginning of 
reform and opening, greatly aroused the peasants' initiative and 
enthusiasm for developing production and emancipated the 
productive forces in agriculture. 
  --Agricultural production broke through the long-standing 
situation of slow growth. Between 1980 and 1990, the gross 
national agricultural output value increased by an average 
annual rate of 6.4 percent; the outputs of grain, cotton, 
oil-bearing crops, sugar-bearing crops, vegetables, fruits, 
pork, beef, mutton, and aquatic products all increased by big 
margins; peasant incomes increased by 6.4 percent in comparable 
terms and peasants, on the whole, had sufficient food and 
clothing for themselves; and the food supply for urban residents 
was also greatly enriched. 
  --The rural economic structure broke through the 
long-standing single-cropping and single-farming pattern. The 
proportions of forestry, animal husbandry, and fishing 
increased. Rural industrial enterprises rose as a new force. 
This gradually changed the situation for more than 30 years 
past wherein agricultural production was limited to crop farming 
and crop farming was limited to grain production. 
  --The comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture broke 
through the long-standing situation of slow growth. Investments 
made by the central government, the local governments, 
collectives, and individual peasants totalled 151.9 billion 
yuan, which was mainly used to strengthen the construction of 
basic facilities for agricultural production. The flood 
prevention facilities along major rivers and around major lakes 
were improved; about 26.7 million hectares of low-yield fields 
were transformed and 2.5 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed; a 
large number of production bases for various farm products, 
improved seeds cultivation bases, and fine breed multiplication 
bases were set up; the forest coverage rate increased from 12 to 
12.9 percent; the ability to monitor and forecast disastrous 
weather for agriculture was enhanced; and various applicable 
crop farming, forest-caring, animal farming, and aquicultural 
techniques were adopted and spread extensively; and the 
comprehensive grain and cotton production capacities increased 
from 300 billion kg and 2.5 million tonnes in the early eighties 
to 425 billion kg and 4.5 million tonnes in the early nineties. 
The comprehensive meat production capacity was also markedly 
increased. 
  --The agricultural economy broke through the pattern of a 
natural economy and the level of commercialization and 
specialization was greatly enhanced. In the eighties, the 
central government and various local governments jointly 
invested nearly 5 billion yuan in building a number of 
production bases for supplying grain, cotton, meat, and 
vegetables. The commercialization rate of farm produce 
increased from 54 to 63 percent and the value of exported farm 
produce and processed products increased by 150 percent. 
  --Agricultural development broke through the model of 
single-item development [dang xiang kai fa 0830 7309 7030 4099] 
and created a new situation of comprehensive development. 
Beginning in 1988, the state allocated large amounts of money 
for comprehensive agricultural development projects, mainly 
aimed at increasing the production of such major products as 
grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, meat, and sugar. According to 
the principle of comprehensively arranging the building of 
forests, roads, fields, and water channels on plains and hilly 
land, thus comprehensively utilizing natural resources, 41 
comprehensive agricultural development zones were successively 
set up in the country. They increased the effective supplies of 
farm produce and played a major role in strengthening the 
lasting momentum of agricultural development. 
  In the nineties we must stabilize and sustain agricultural 
development to better satisfy the needs of the high-speed 
economic growth and the increasingly better-off people in their 
daily lives. At present, some difficulties still exist in the 
course of stabilizing and quickening agricultural development in 
our country. First, agriculture is a sensitive industry, facing 
both natural and market risks, and is also a basic industry 
which produces vital social effects but only yields modest 
economic returns. While the economic structure in our country 
is changing into a socialist market economy, because the 
economic control and regulatory mechanisms are imperfect, the 
economic activities are apt to be driven by immediate economic 
returns and funds and materials are apt to be placed in 
nonagricultural fields. This is unfavorable to agricultural 
development. Second, farmland and other agricultural resources 
are continuously decreasing but the population is steadily 
increasing. The load on agriculture is getting heavier and 
heavier. Third, the material foundation for agriculture remains 
rather weak, and the capacity to resist natural disasters 
remains inadequate. Fourth, the economic efficiency of 
agricultural production is rather low and this affects the 
peasants' production enthusiasm. Fifth, in trying to progress 
to a more advanced stage, agricultural production lacks low-cost 
improved seeds and low-cost new techniques for cultivating 
improved varieties and breeds with high efficiency; and the 
technological conditions are not suited to the needs of 
production development. Therefore, from the long-term and 
overall point of view, the task of agricultural development in 
the nineties will be extremely arduous. 
  There still exists great potential for agricultural 
development in our country. Of the existing over 95 million 
hectares of farmland, intermediate and low-yield land accounts 
for about 60 percent. If the soil of such land is properly 
treated, the per-mu grain output can be increased by several 
hundred jin. Of the existing grassland, second- and third-class 
grassland accounts for 80 percent. After being improved, such 
grassland can feed several times the current number of animals. 
The per-mu aquatic product output of the current water area is 
only 95 kg and the return rate of the feed in animal farming is 
still quite low. After feeding techniques are improved, the 
meat output can be increased substantially. In the whole 
country, there are over 33 million hectares of wasteland which 
could be reclaimed for agricultural purposes. In addition, over 
76.7 million hectares of waste hills and slopes, over 1.3 
billion hectares of beaches land, and some 12 million hectares 
of fresh water surface can all be developed and used for 
agriculture. With the adoption of effective measures and the 
increase in agricultural input, and with the accelerating 
comprehensive development of agricultural resources, we will be 
able to substantially enhance the comprehensive productive 
capacity of agriculture. 
<H3>  I. Objectives and Guidelines for Agricultural Development in 
the Nineties </H3>
  First, the main objectives of agricultural development in 
our 
country in the nineties are to: Comprehensively develop the 
rural economy, increase production of major agricultural 
products in a stable manner, and to ensure that their quantity, 
variety, and quality meet the needs of the comparatively 
well-off people in the whole country and the needs of the 
developing national economy. By the year 2000, grain output 
will reach 500 billion jin; cotton output will reach 5.25 
million metric tons; and the production of oil-bearing crops, 
sugar-bearing crops, and other cash crops, as well as the 
production of meat and aquatic products, should continuously 
increase. The rural economy should maintain an appropriate 
growth rate. In 2000, the gross national agricultural output 
value (calculated according to 1990 constant prices) will reach 
1,210 billion yuan, effecting an average annual increase of 
about 4 percent. The total output value produced by township 
and town enterprises throughout the country will reach 5,290 
billion yuan (1990 constant prices), increasing by an average 
annual rate of 18.5 percent. The peasants' living standards 
will reach the level of being comparatively well-off, with their 
per capita net income reaching 1,200 yuan and increasing by 5.8 
percent each year. The pace of economic development in poor 
areas will be quickened and the masses there will basically have 
sufficient food and clothing by the end of this century. 
  Second, the guidelines for agricultural development in the 
nineties are to: Continue to stabilize the production 
responsibility system mainly in the form of concluding the 
household output contracts; continue to improve the double-tier 
management system which combines individual household operations 
with unified collective arrangements; greatly develop the 
community service systems for agriculture; and to gradually 
build up the strength of the collective economies according to 
the actual conditions in the various localities. It is 
necessary to continuously strengthen the agricultural 
foundation, increase input to agriculture, improve the 
infrastructural facilities for agriculture, and ensure that 
agriculture moves up to a new stage and satisfies the needs of 
the national economy's sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu 
kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development. 
The rural reform should be deepened in the light of the 
requirements of establishing and improving the socialist market 
economy and the basic facilities and various community service 
systems in the fields of rural markets, transportation, storage, 
information, and consultation should be built up more 
intensively. Agricultural scientific research should be 
advanced and technological results should be promoted and spread 
extensively, thus guiding agriculture to develop in the 
orientation of "high yield, good quality, and high efficiency." 
Efforts should be made continuously to organize comprehensive 
agricultural development and the comprehensive agricultural 
production capacity should be enhanced through the development 
of such reserve agricultural resources as waste hills, waste 
slopes, waste water areas, waste beaches, and waste sandy land. 
The rural production structure and economic structure should be 
optimized; great efforts should be made to develop agriculture 
oriented toward export and agriculture should be gradually moved 
onto the path of "being oriented to the market, more effectively 
utilizing resources, optimizing the structure, and enhancing the 
efficiency." Crop farming, animal farming, and product 
processing should be properly integrated and agricultural 
production should be linked with commerce and industry. New 
trades and industries should be developed in the rural economy. 
The development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and 
fishing and the development of the secondary and tertiary 
industries should be properly coordinated. The scope of rural 
employment should be broadened. Peasants' income should be 
increased and peasants' living standards should be raised to the 
level of comparatively well-off. 
<H3>  II. General Arrangements for Agricultural Development in the 
Nineties </H3>
  Third, agricultural production must follow the principle of 
being arranged according to the local conditions and giving play 
to the local advantages in natural resources and the local 
economic and technological advantages. Crop farming, animal 
husbandry, forestry, and fishing should be developed as long as 
the local conditions are suited to such operations. Efforts 
should be make to promote the comprehensive development of 
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline industry, and 
fishery and also to promote regional coordination, 
specialization, and commercialization of agricultural production. 
  Fourth, the state encourages and supports the development of 
grain production. Grain production and marketing in the whole 
country should be arranged according to the principle of making 
all provinces and autonomous regions effect self-sufficiency 
first and then transfer surplus grain to nearby areas according 
to a reasonable distribution plan. By the end of this century, 
most provinces and autonomous regions should be able to 
basically effect grain self-sufficiency. A small number of 
provinces and autonomous regions that need to take grain from 
other areas should establish long-term and stable grain supply 
relations with nearby grain-supplying provinces and autonomous 
regions. Provinces and autonomous regions that transfer their 
grain products to other areas should give play to their 
advantage in grain production and properly organize grain 
production and marketing according to the actual needs of their 
own localities, the state, and other provinces and autonomous 
regions; they should do this by bearing the overall national 
interests in mind. Provinces and autonomous regions which can 
effect grain self-sufficiency should make efforts to develop 
grain production and strive to produce sufficient grain for 
themselves. All localities should build up their own commodity 
grain production bases according to their local conditions. The 
variety of grain crops should be adjusted according to the 
market demand. Good-quality varieties should be greatly 
developed. The production of grain used to feed animals should 
also be increased. The middle and lower valleys of the Chang 
Jiang and the southeast coastal areas should increase the 
production of good-quality rice; the valleys of the Huang He, 
Huai He, Hai He, and the northeast region should develop the 
production of wheat, corn, and soya bean. 
  Fifth, the production of cash crops and other crops should 
be 
concentrated appropriately and arranged according to the local 
conditions so that local advantages can be brought into better 
play and disadvantages avoided. The cropping arrangements 
should be further readjusted according to this principle. 
Cotton production should be developed mainly in the plains 
between the Huang He, Huai He, and the Hai He; in the plains of 
the middle and lower valleys of the Chang Jiang; and in 
Xinjiang. As for the production of oil-bearing crops, rapeseed 
should be planted mainly in areas south of the Chang Jiang and 
peanuts should be grown in areas north of the Chang Jiang. The 
production of other oil-bearing crops should also be properly 
arranged. As for the production of sugar-bearing crops, sugar 
cane growth should be stabilized and developed in the southeast 
coastal areas and sugar beet should be grown in the northeast 
and northwest regions. At the same time, sugar cane production 
in Yunnan and Guangxi should also be increased. 
  Sixth, forestry production should proceed from fostering 
forestry resources, increasing the forest coverage rate, and 
increasing the timber and forest product supply capacity. 
Production layout should be readjusted. A batch of windbreak 
forests, soil conservation forests, and field protection forests 
should be planted along the Chang Jiang and along the coastline, 
and in northwest China, the northern part of north China, and 
the west part of northeast China, the Taihangshan area, and the 
plains where strong winds and sandstorms produce harmful effects 
and soil erosion is serious. Timber production bases should be 
built to rapidly and intensively increase the production of 
timber mainly in east China, central and south China, and 
southwest China. Areas with favorable conditions, especially 
those to the south of the Chang Jiang, can build bases for 
oil-bearing trees, perfume, medical materials, and dried fruits. 
In hilly areas where there is a shortage of firewood and in the 
dry areas of north China, as well as in some coastal areas, fuel 
forests should be planted in order to mitigate the short supply 
of energy sources in the rural areas. Straw and crop stalks can 
be used as fertilizer and as raw materials for generating 
methane. 
  Seventh, animal farming should focus on pig raising and 
great 
efforts should also be made to increase the feeding of 
grain-saving herbivorous animals and poultry. The suburban 
areas of large and medium cities should mainly develop the 
production of animals, poultry, eggs, and milk in order to meet 
the consumption needs of urban residents. Agricultural areas 
should continue to promote the production of pork, strive to 
increase the supply rate of pigs [chu lan lu 0427 2936 3764], 
and increase the production of pigs with leaner meat. At the 
same time, it is necessary to spread the technique for making 
ammoniac stalks [jie gan an hua ji shu 4447 4427 8637 0553 2111 
2611], and greatly develop the feeding of cattle in crop farming 
areas. In half-crop-farming and half-animal- farming areas, 
attention should be paid to giving play to the favorable 
condition of having rich feed and forage grass and we should 
more rapidly develop the production of such herbivorous animals 
as cattle and sheep. Pastoral areas should attach importance to 
the building of grassland and should improve the quality of 
forage grass. They should prevent the grassland from 
retrograding and becoming eroded by sand and should enhance the 
meat production capacity. Efforts should be made to increase 
the production of wool in order to meet the needs of the 
developing textile industry. 
  Eighth, freshwater and seawater aquaculture should be 
greatly 
developed as should oceangoing fishing. Importance should be 
attached to the processing and comprehensive use of aquatic 
products. The 11 key projects of developing freshwater 
aquaculture in the Zhu Jiang Delta area and other areas should 
be properly handled. Reservoirs should also be used to produce 
aquatic products. Seawater aquaculture should be focused on the 
use of coastal beaches. The intensity of offshore fishing 
should be strictly controlled and efforts should mainly be made 
to catch fish in the middle and upper layers of the East China 
Sea and the outer scope of the Huang Hai as well as in the South 
China Sea. At the same time, oceangoing fishing should also be 
developed more rapidly. 
<H3>  III. Relying on Agricultural Scientific and Technological 
Progress, Enhancing the Unit Output Rate of Land and Other 
Agricultural Resources </H3>
  Ninth, to realize the objective of increasing agricultural 
production in the nineties, we must grasp the key link of 
enhancing the unit area yield of the land. It is necessary to 
rely on scientific and technological progress to improve the 
conditions for agricultural production and to continuously raise 
the unit area yield. In these 10 years, the per-mu output of 
grain and cotton should increase by 50 kg and 12 kg 
respectively, close to the increases in the eighties. 
  Tenth, effectively organize adoption of the new water-saving 
irrigation techniques and raise the utilization rate of 
irrigation water. The water-saving irrigation techniques should 
be actively spread in various localities according to their 
specific conditions and water-saving farming should be promoted. 
The techniques of carrying water through pipes, building water 
channels with liners [qu dao chen qi 3255 6670 6000 4265], 
preventing leakage, irrigating fields by means of spraying and 
dropping should be spread broadly. The maintenance and 
management of water conservancy and irrigation works should be 
strengthened and the use efficiency of the facilities should be 
raised. The utilization rate of irrigating water in our country 
should be raised from 40 to about 50 percent. 
  Eleventh, raising the level of using fertilizers and 
pesticides scientifically. It is necessary to adopt the 
techniques of using chemical fertilizer deep inside the soil, 
applying fertilizer according to the soil-testing formulae, and 
combining the use of organic and nonorganic fertilizers. The 
utilization rate of chemical fertilizer should be raised from 
about 30 to 40 percent. Training should be given to peasants so 
that they can use various types of pesticide in good time, 
reasonably, and scientifically, thus improving the condition of 
preventing and curing plant diseases and wiping out insect 
pests. Efforts should be made to spread the use of biological 
pesticides and the adoption of biological prevention techniques, 
thus reducing the losses caused by plant diseases and pests to 
agricultural production. 
  Twelfth, comprehensive measures should be adopted to improve 
the quality of the existing farmland. Sloping fields should be 
transformed into terraced fields; fields should be leveled; soil 
should be improved; the irrigation and drainage conditions 
should be made better; the fertility of the land should be 
increased; and scientific farming techniques should be adopted 
to transform the low-yield fields which now account for 
one-third of the existing farmland. Thus, the unit area output 
can be raised substantially. 
  Thirteenth, It is necessary to make full use of the light, 
heat, water, and soil resources; improve the farming techniques; 
increase the multiplecropping index; and increase the sown area. 
In southern areas, the rate of winter cropping in idle fields 
should be raised as should the area intercropping area. In the 
southern areas where the light and heat resources are 
insufficient for two seasons and more than enough for one 
season, the measure of planting ratooning rice should be 
adopted. By the end of this century, the multiplecropping index 
in the whole country should be raised from 150 percent in the 
late eighties to about 160 percent and the sown area should be 
increased by an average of some 730,000 hectares every year. 
  Fourteenth, cultivating, spreading, and popularizing the 
adoption of improved seeds and varieties. The agricultural 
basic research and applied research should be strengthened. A 
number of high-yield, good-quality, disease-resistant, and 
pest-resistant varieties and breeds of trees, crops, and animals 
should be reserved and cultivated. At the same time, it is 
necessary to introduce a number of improved varieties and fine 
breeds from abroad in a planned way. While great efforts are 
made to spread various types of improved varieties, special 
attention should be paid to the cultivation of good quality 
high-yield hybrid rice, hybrid corn, and hybrid rape. The breeds 
of lean-meat pigs and the fine hybrid breeds of cattle, sheep, 
and poultry should be spread more quickly. In the whole 
country, the seeds for grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops 
should be changed once or twice in the nineties. The rate of 
adopting fine breeds of animals, poultry, and aquatic animals 
should be further raised. 
  Fifteenth, making great efforts to spread applicable 
agricultural techniques. The use of improved seeds should be 
combined with the adoption of advanced techniques. A batch of 
markedly effective applicable techniques and technologies should 
be selected and spread as key measures. By the year 2000, the 
application rate of agricultural scientific research results 
should be raised from around 40 to about 50 percent. Efforts 
should be made to further advance the "Harvest Plan," the "Spark 
Project," the "Spreading Programs," and other activities of 
spreading scientific research results and advanced techniques 
and technologies. The techniques of model cultivation, dry land 
farming, plastic film covering, cultivation on protected land, 
optimized farming methods, forecasts of plant diseases and pests 
and comprehensive preventive measures; the advanced animal 
feeding techniques and the methods of making animal feed, 
including the technique of making ammoniac stalks; the 
techniques of high-efficiency production of freshwater and 
seawater aquatic products, including the methods of 
proliferating resources and preventing animal diseases; and the 
technologies of keeping farm produce fresh and processing, 
storing, and transporting farm produce should be spread broadly. 
It is necessary to give extensive technical training and 
education to peasants and to increase their scientific and 
general knowledge so that they can better master the scientific 
farming methods. 
<H3>  IV. Reinforcing the Construction of Agricultural Commodities 
Production Bases </H3>
  Sixteenth, reinforcing the construction of the commodity 
production bases for supplying grain, cotton, cooking oil, and 
sugar. On the basis of consolidating and improving the existing 
commodity grain production base counties, we will build 226 new 
bases so that the number of commodity grain base counties 
reaches 500. The comprehensive commodity grain production 
capacity should reach half of the total national output of 
commodity grain and should be built into high-yield, 
good-quality, and high-efficiency agricultural bases mainly 
producing commodity grain. At the same time, the state-owned 
farms in Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia should be 
turned into agricultural commodity bases mainly producing 
commodity grain. In addition, we will set up 150 high-quality 
cotton production base counties and a number of new sugar 
production bases. A number of state-owned farms producing 
cotton, sugar, and rubber will be turned into sample bases for 
the specialization and commercialization of agriculture. 
  Seventeenth, quicken the establishment of bases for 
fast-growing and high-yield, special, quality timber forests and 
cash-earning forests. 
  The state needs to establish a number of fast-growing, 
high-yield timber forest bases in the provinces and autonomous 
regions of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, 
Zhejiang, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan as well as in the 
northeast and Inner Mongolia, planting 5 million hectares of new 
trees to increase timber supplies in the early 2000's. 
Moreover, it will establish 500 special and quality 
cash-earning forest production bases all over China. 
  Eighteenth, consolidate the development of the "shopping 
basket project." 
  1. The establishment of meat, egg, milk, and vegetable 
production bases. We will build 200 new lean pig production 
bases and increase the number of butchered pigs by 50 million 
annually. We will vigorously promote the technique of raising 
cows with ammoniated straw, set up a number of lean cow 
production bases and increase the number of butchered cows to 
900,000 annually. We will set up milk cow and milk buffalo 
production bases in the northeast, Inner Mongolia, and the 
southeast, increase the number of milk cattle to 200,000 capable 
of supplying 600,000 metric tons [figures as published] of milk 
each year. We will set up sheep and goat bases in the northwest 
and Inner Mongolia. We will establish a number of intensive and 
modern egg and chicken farms as well as a number of vegetable 
production bases in some large and medium cities and industrial 
and mining areas. We will set up a number of poultry farming 
bases in some areas in the south where there are plenty of water 
and grass resources. 
  2. The establishment of bases for the breeding of aquatic 
products. For freshwater breeding, we should pay good attention 
to the transformation of medium- and low-yield ponds and to the 
construction of their supporting projects, improving their yield 
per unit of area. We should vigorously develop aquatic product 
breeding in large and medium rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and some 
low-lying land along the rivers and lakes, building a number of 
new bases producing aquatic products. While paying good 
attention to the establishment of seawater aquatic product 
breeding bases in the Liaodong and Shandong Peninsulas and Bohai 
Bay, we will quicken the exploitation and utilization of the 
shorelines of southern provinces, vigorously develop the 
breeding of valuable marine products, and gradually set up a 
number of new bases producing valuable marine products. We will 
continue to improve the construction of fishing bases in West 
Africa, North America, South America, and South Asia, and the 
construction of the deep-sea fishing bases in the South Pacific 
and other areas. 
  Nineteenth, strengthen the construction of export-led bases 
for agricultural and sideline products. We will develop 
foreign- currency earning agriculture, strengthen international 
cooperation and exchanges, push China's agriculture toward the 
international market, and quicken the pace of agricultural 
modernization. On the basis of consolidating and perfecting the 
existing export-led bases for agricultural and sideline 
products, we will continue to set up a number of new export-led 
bases for agricultural and sideline products. We will develop 
the export of good-brand, special, quality, and new products and 
finely processed and highly wrought goods by fully utilizing the 
abundance of China's rural work force and agricultural and 
sideline products, and actively open up the international market. 
<H5>  V. Strengthen Comprehensive Agricultural Development </H5>
  Twentieth, the main tasks of comprehensive agricultural 
development in the nineties are: 
  1. We will basically stabilize the area of China's total 
farmland and ensure that the new reclaimed area is no less than 
the area of occupied farmland. We will adopt strict management 
measures to control the occupation of farmland and stick to the 
principle of reclaiming one mu of land to recover one mu of 
occupied land and set the target of land reclamation at 2.1 
million hectares or above nationally. 
  2. We will transform 18 million hectares of medium- and 
low-yield fields, plant 6.6 million hectares of trees, create 20 
million hectares of artificial grassland and improved grassland, 
and improve 1.67 million hectares of medium- and low-yield paddy 
fields. 
  3. We will increase the comprehensive grain production 
capability by 38 billion kg and the comprehensive cotton 
production capability by 400,000 metric tons. 
  Twenty-first, the important points in comprehensive 
agricultural development are: 
  1. We will reclaim a total of 1.9 million hectares of land 
and transform 14.67 million hectares of medium- and low-yield 
fields in 10 state-level key development regions including the 
plains along the Huang He, Huai He, and the Hai He, and in the 
Sanjiang Plain [san jiang ping yuan 0005 3068 1627 0626], the 
Songliao Plain [song liao ping yuan 2646 6697 1627 0626], the 
Huanghe Delta, and the plains at the middle and lower reaches of 
the Chang Jiang. 
  2. We will reclaim 280,000 hectares of farmland and 
transform over 3.3 million hectares of medium- and low-yield 
fields in 12 provincial-level key development areas, including 
the plain at the foot of Yan Shan, the area bounded by the 
northern part of the Wei He and the eastern Long Shan, in the 
Nanyang Basin, and in the hilly areas of Hubei. 
  3. We will create 13.3 million hectares of artificial 
grassland and improved grassland, of which over 3.3 million 
hectares will be high-standard artificial grassland, in the six 
key pastoral and semi-pastoral areas including the grassland in 
northern Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Ili and Altay in 
Xinjiang, the grasslands in the northwest of Sichuan and 
southern Gansu, the grassland along the Qinghai Hu, and the 
agricultural and pastoral areas in northeast China. 
  4. We will strive to enable over two thirds of the poverty- 
stricken counties in the karst areas of the southwest, and in 
the hilly gullies on the loess plateau, to possess approximately 
one mu of basic farmland per capita. 
  5. We will reclaim 2.33 million hectares of desert along the 
western corridor to the west of the Huang He and in the oases of 
Xinjiang and exploit and utilize one million hectares of 
resources in the desert areas. 
  Twenty-second, for comprehensive agricultural development, 
we 
need to strengthen the concepts of the market, quality, and 
returns, attaching importance to improving the quality and 
production returns of farm products while making efforts to 
boost the output of farm products in keeping with market needs. 
We will really take economic returns as the center and optimize 
resource allocation and the structure and layout of production. 
Based on the comprehensive exploitation and utilization of all 
land resources, we will launch the comprehensive development of 
hills, water, fields, forests, and highways, developing them in 
width and in breadth at the same time. It is necessary to 
promote the circulation of farm products, improve storage 
facilities, and develop the infrastructural construction of 
rural markets. 
  Twenty-third, stabilize and perfect the comprehensive 
agricultural development policy. The policies pursued for 
comprehensive agricultural development areas during the Seventh 
Five-Year Plan will be continued and remain unchanged during the 
nineties. For example, for five years, we will not arrange for 
the state purchase of grain increases after the improvement and 
transformation of medium- and low-yield fields and the grain 
produced in newly-reclaimed farmlands and we will not levy 
agricultural tax on the newly-reclaimed farmlands; the state 
will arrange some discount-interest loans, set targets, and 
grant funds while the local authorities pay the discount 
interest; the state will continue to increase investment in 
large-scale water conservancy projects including the harnessing 
of rivers; and priority will be given to making arrangements for 
the distribution of such agricultural means of production as 
diesel oil, chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and agricultural 
plastic film. 
  Twenty-fourth, strengthen the management of the capital for 
comprehensive agricultural development and improve its use 
efficiency. The existing sources of capital used for 
comprehensive agricultural development must be ensured, while a 
certain proportion of the fees for the use and transfer of 
state-owned land, and a certain proportion of the income from 
the land in various types of economic development areas, will be 
used on comprehensive agricultural development. For 
comprehensive agricultural development we should use market 
mechanisms and employ such means of competition as inviting 
public tenders for projects, referring to and using the project 
management methods of international financial organizations, 
such as the World Bank, and improve the efficiency of capital 
use. Comprehensive agricultural development must be closely 
integrated with, and mutually matched by, the construction of 
farmland and irrigation and water conservancy works, assistance 
to and development of poverty-stricken areas, the comprehensive 
harnessing of the small valleys in hilly areas, afforestation, 
and work-relief programs, forming an overall large-scale 
integral development project. 
<H5>  VI. Energetically Develop Township and Town Enterprises </H5>
  Twenty-fifth, developing township and town enterprises is 
the 
only way to boost the rural economy, increase the incomes of 
peasants, shift the surplus rural work force elsewhere, and to 
promote agricultural modernization and the development of the 
national economy. In the nineties, on the basis of 
consolidating the agricultural foundation, it is necessary to 
place township and town enterprises in an important strategic 
position. It is necessary to continue to implement the 
principle of "actively rendering support to them, making 
rational plans for them, giving them correct guidance, and 
strengthening their management"; energetically develop new 
agriculture-related trades and industries; and unswervingly 
support the development of township and town enterprises. 
  Twenty-sixth, township and town enterprises must be 
organized, planned, and rationally laid out and must have their 
structures adjusted and their returns improved in keeping with 
the national economic development plan and the industrial 
policy. It is necessary to arrange for the processing of urban 
and rural farm products in keeping with the principle that 
processing is near raw materials production areas and is 
rational economically. As many newly-added farm product 
processing industries as possible should be run in rural areas. 
Cities with the conditions should gradually shift farm and 
sideline product processing industries to rural areas. Township 
and town enterprises must maintain a stable rate of development 
on the premise of continuously improving product quality and 
economic returns. We should treat and guide the township and 
town enterprises in different areas differently. For those in 
the west and in ethnic minority-inhabited areas, we should fully 
use their special resources and labor advantages, vigorously 
introduce professional people and technology, develop horizontal 
association, and set up a number of resources-processing 
enterprises to nurture omnidirectional development. Central 
China must make use of the grain and other farm product 
resources, carry out comprehensive economic development, enhance 
the processing expertise, and give comprehensive compensation 
for the production of grain and other farm products. Coastal 
areas must base themselves on their existing foundations, 
quicken technological transformation, and develop high-tech 
products and export-oriented products to earn foreign currency. 
It is necessary to strengthen enterprise management and spur 
township and town enterprises to improve both product standards 
and quality and to improve the quality of enterprises. 
  Twenty-seventh, formulate policies and measures and 
vigorously guide and support the healthy development of township 
and town enterprises. It is particularly necessary to 
energetically support the development of the township and town 
enterprises in central and western China. The special loans 
arranged by the People's Bank of China for central and western 
China and for ethnic-minority-inhabited areas should be 
appropriately increased each year to mainly help the major 
grain-producing areas in central and western China develop 
township and town enterprises. Loans offered by international 
financial institutions for township and town enterprises should 
mainly lean toward central and western China. We should 
encourage eastern, central, and western China, and 
ethnic-minority-inhabited areas to develop horizontal economic 
association and cooperation. Areas with a comparatively 
developed economy should help poverty-stricken areas to develop 
their economies so that they can supplement each other with 
their advantages and promote each other for common development. 
  Twenty-eighth, it is necessary to continuously implement the 
principle of "developing agriculture with industry" among 
township and town enterprises. We should enhance the 
construction of basic agricultural facilities by developing 
township and town enterprises and increasing investment in 
agriculture. We will strive to enable township and town 
enterprises to absorb another 50 million of the surplus rural 
work force by the year 2000, on the premise of meeting the needs 
of agricultural production. 
  Twenty-ninth, strengthen guidance for the development of 
small towns in rural areas. As for the development of small 
cities in rural areas, they should rely on their existing market 
towns, plan their development in a scientific way, work out a 
rational layout, and gradually implement plans to nurture the 
development of tertiary industry and the shift in the surplus 
work force. It is necessary to guide township and town 
enterprises for their relative concentration geographically and 
for them to integrate with the development of small cities. It 
is necessary to formulate preferential policies and attract 
peasants to small cities so that they will engage in industry, 
business, the construction industry, transportation, services, 
and others. 
<H3>  VII. Consolidate the Establishment of the Support System for 
Agricultural Development </H3>
  Thirtieth, irrigation and water conservancy works are an 
important guarantee for the sustained and steady development of 
agricultural production. Both the central and local authorities 
should concentrate their energies on constructing a number of 
major irrigation and water conservancy works. Major projects 
for the nineties are: 
  1. Flood-prevention projects. We will: Construct the Three 
Gorges Project for the Chang Jiang and the key water works at 
the bottleneck of the Li Shui; continue to increase the height 
of, and consolidate the flood dams on, the middle and lower 
Chang Jiang; harness Lake Dongting and Lake Poyang; and 
construct water conservancy projects like the Honghu Project. 
We will construct 10 projects in Lake Tai, including those at 
Taipuhe and Wangyuhe and the Hangjia Drainage Project. We will 
construct a small-tide, low-water key water work project for the 
Huang He and increase the height of and consolidate the flood 
dams in its lower reaches. We will widen the floodwater 
passages in the middle reaches of the Huai He and widen their 
outlets to other rivers and to the sea in the lower Huang He. 
We will construct the Xinhe Flood Prevention Project, the 
project diverting the floodwaters of the Yi He, the Shu He, and 
the Si He to the east and to the south; and the Shimantan 
Irrigation and Water Conservancy Project. For the Zhu Jiang, we 
will construct the Feilai Gorge Waterworks Project in its 
northern tributary and the Dateng Gorge Waterworks Project in 
its western tributary. We will continue to construct 
flood-prevention projects on the Hailuan He and the Songliao He 
to enhance their flood- resistant capabilities. 
  2. Water resources projects. We will emphasize the 
construction of the projects which divert water from southern 
provinces to Beijing, Tianjin, and northern China; the key 
waterworks at Wanjiazhai along the Huang He, and the water 
diversion project which diverts water from the Huang He to 
Shanxi, Hebei's Taolinkou Reservoir Project, and Xinjiang's 
Uruwati [wu lu wa ti 3527 7627 3907 2251] Waterworks. We will 
begin the Daliushu project along the Huang He. We will quicken 
water diversion from the northeast to the south and strive for 
the earliest possible construction of the preliminary stage work 
for water diversion from the Jiang He, the Ji He, and the Huai 
He to Anhui. 
  3. Irrigation and drainage works. We will construct and 
transform a number of large irrigation and drainage works, which 
mainly include Sichuan's Wudu and Shengzhong irrigation works 
and Dujiangyan transformation project; the irrigation and 
drainage works at the Great Bend of the Huang He in Ningxia and 
Inner Mongolia; Shaanxi's Donglei Waterworks; Henan and 
Shandong's large-scale water diversion and irrigation projects; 
the waterworks in the irrigated areas of Anhui's Pi He, Shiguan 
He, and Hangbu He; the waterworks at the Chaersen Reservoir and 
irrigated areas in Inner Mongolia and Jilin; Gansu's project 
which diverts water from the Datong He to the Qinwangchuan area 
to the north of Lanzhou, and the Qingtai irrigation project; and 
Hainan's Songtao irrigation project. We will strive to increase 
the effective irrigated area by 5.33 million hectares within 10 
years so that, by the year 2000, the total irrigated area across 
the country will reach 53.3 million hectares or more. 
  4. Hydropower projects. Increase China's hydroelectric 
systems by a total installed capacity of 15 million kw, of which 
2.8 million kw comprise the installed capacity of medium and 
large hydropower stations; 6.2 million kw are from medium 
hydropower stations; and 6 million kw are from small hydropower 
stations. We will enable 500 counties in rural areas to 
basically have access to electricity. 
  5. Water and soil conservation. We must put an end to soil 
and water losses over a total area of 400,000 square km in the 
nineties, with the emphasis on stopping soil and water losses in 
the middle reaches of the Huang He and in the upper reaches of 
the Chang Jiang. At the same time, we will pay good attention to 
conserving soil and water in other rivers including the Zhu 
Jiang, the Hai He, the Huai He, and the Liao He. We will 
harness small rivers in the northwest and improve the ecological 
environment by adopting engineering and biological measures at 
the same time. 
  Thirty-first, quickening the development of agriculture 
support industries is an important condition which guarantees 
the upgrading of agriculture. The major tasks in this respect 
are: 
  1. Strengthen the development of the chemical fertilizer 
industry. In the nineties, we will build Guizhou's Wengfu 
Chemical Fertilizer Factory whose annual output of double 
superphosphate will reach 800,000 metric tons; Hubei's Dayukou 
Project whose annual output of double superphosphate will reach 
560,000 metric tons; the second-phase project of Qinghai's 
Potash Fertilizer Factory whose annual output of potassium 
chloride will reach 800,000 metric tons; Yunnan's 
highly-concentrated phosphate fertilizer project; and a number 
of large and medium chemical fertilizer production plants and 
support chemical and mining projects in Hainan, Inner Mongolia, 
Shaanxi's Weihe, Jiangxi's Jiujiang, and Hunan's Dongting. We 
will quicken the transformation of small chemical fertilizer 
factories and promote the introduction of new generations of 
products. We will strive to produce 150 million metric tons of 
chemical fertilizer by the year 2000. 
  2. Quicken the development of agriculture-related industries 
such as those producing pesticide, agricultural plastic film, 
and farm machinery. As for pesticide, we need to quicken the 
readjustment of the product mix, develop and transform a number 
of large and medium enterprises, energetically develop 
high-efficiency and low-waste pesticide varieties, and set up 
China's pesticide research center. We will boost the pesticide 
output to 240,000 or 250,000 metric tons by the year 2000. It 
is necessary to set up and transform a number of enterprises 
producing agricultural plastic film materials and to produce 
more standardized varieties of agricultural plastic film. We 
will boost the output of agricultural plastic film to 800,000 
metric tons by the year 2000. It is necessary to quicken the 
development of the farm machinery industry so that by the year 
2000, we will be able to produce annually 200,000 large and 
medium tractors, 500,000 small tractors, 10,000 combined reaping 
machines, and internal combustion engines totalling 80 million 
hp. Diesel oil for agricultural use and electricity used in 
rural areas must be gradually increased and we will make great 
efforts to create conditions for agricultural modernization. 
  Thirty-second, forestry is the ecological defense of high 
and stable agricultural yield. In the nineties, we must pay 
attention to the following key construction projects of forestry: 
  1. The "three north" shelter-forest project: The task of 
afforesting a total area of 7.18 million hectares must be 
fulfilled by the end of this century. 
  2. The first phase project of building a shelter-forest 
system in nine provinces and 145 counties along the upper and 
middle reaches of the Chang Jiang. A total area of 6.67 million 
hectares will be forested. 
  3. The first phase project of building a shelter-forest 
system in 11 provinces, regions, and municipalities along the 
coast. A total area of 2.44 million hectares will be forested. 
  4. We must continue to accomplish the Taihang Shan 
afforestation project and the plains afforestation project in 
major grain-producing areas in our country, such as the Sanjiang 
Plain, the Songliao Plain, the Huabei Plain, and the plains 
along the middle and lower reaches of Chang Jiang. 
  Thirty-third, efforts must be made to strengthen the 
construction of a meteorological forecasting system. In the 
nineties, we must accelerate the pace of meteorological 
modernization, with the core being the construction of system 
projects related to the business of medium-term numerical 
real-time forecasting, the reception and processing of ground 
information from geostationary meteorological satellites, the 
business of the comprehensive application of meteorological 
satellites, the automation of atmospheric monitoring, a 
comprehensive meteorological information network, and the 
application of meteorological satellite monitoring. We must 
strengthen the monitoring of disastrous weather and short-term 
weather forecasting, improve the effectiveness and precision of 
forecasts, and reduce losses brought on agriculture by natural 
calamities. 
  Thirty-fourth, efforts must be made to strengthen 
construction of the feed industry. In the nineties, a number of 
new enterprises developing and utilizing rapeseed will be 
established in oil-producing areas. Two 5,000-tonne lysine 
enterprises, one or two 100,000-metric tons calcium phosphate 
producing bases, and a set of large feed-grade vitamin A and E 
installations will be built. By 2000, the national mixed feed 
processing capability must be over 70 million metric tons and 
the yield of mixed feed must exceed 55 million metric tons. 
  Thirty-fifth, efforts must be made to strengthen the 
construction of livestock vaccine and pharmaceutical factories. 
In the nineties, as far as prevention and treatment of epidemic 
diseases in livestock is concerned, we must continue to uphold 
the principle of "relying mainly on prevention" and devote our 
energies and financial resources to doing a good job of 
preventing epidemic diseases which are very harmful to livestock 
and mankind. We must focus on the construction and 
transformation of a number of biological pharmaceutical 
factories which will serve the whole country. During the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan, projects for making animal health care products 
will be arranged in Jinan, Shandong, and Shanghai and a new 
capability of producing vaccine for 6 billion poultry will be 
added. Technological transformation must be carried out in key 
bio-medical factories. 
  Thirty-sixth, efforts must be made to strengthen the 
construction of agricultural scientific research. We must 
enhance international scientific and technological exchanges and 
cooperation and organize the research work of major domestic 
agricultural scientific and technological projects properly. We 
must strengthen the construction of key state laboratories and 
professional research institutes and enrich and improve the 
conditions for scientific research into agriculture. We must 
strive to add more funds to tackle key problems, carry out 
experiments, and develop new technology in scientific research 
in agriculture. The state will focus on the construction of 
scientific research institutes in agriculture, forestry, and 
water conservancy which are serving the whole country, including 
the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Academy of Forestry 
Sciences, and the Academy of Water Conservancy Sciences. We 
must strengthen basic scientific research of biological projects 
(including gene projects, cell projects, enzyme projects, and 
fermentation projects) as well as research of application 
sciences, such as fine-breed reproduction, cultivation 
techniques, irrigation techniques, water and soil conservation 
techniques, prevention and cure of plant diseases and insect 
pests, and skills in processing, freshening, storing, and 
transporting farm produce. Governments at all levels must take 
effective measures to support and promote close integration 
between scientific research in agriculture and the work of 
popularizing agricultural technology. We must not only devote 
our energies to supporting basic scientific research in 
agriculture but also attach great importance to the application 
and popularization of scientific and technological achievements 
to speed up the transformation of scientific research 
achievements in agriculture. 
  Thirty-seventh, we must do a good job in rural elementary 
education and higher education in agriculture. We must 
vigorously promote rural elementary, vocational, and adult 
education to bring about close integration between education and 
economic construction. The authorities at the county and 
township levels must bring education into the local economic and 
social development programs; supervise elementary, vocational, 
technical, and adult education at different levels; and 
popularize education on agricultural technology in higher 
primary and junior secondary classes in rural areas. Efforts 
must be made to coordinate and plan economic, scientific and 
technological, and educational development and to basically 
popularize nine-year compulsory education. We must further 
accomplish the construction of a number of key universities, 
colleges, and courses in agriculture, forestry, and water 
conservancy; devote our energies to building a number of key 
secondary schools in agriculture, forestry, and water 
conservancy which have a higher standard. We must help colleges 
and secondary schools in agriculture, forestry, and water 
conservancy accelerate the process of building up teaching bases 
and set up teacher training centers for colleges in agriculture, 
forestry, and water conservancy. To fully promote the rural 
economy, we must rely on education because "education is the 
foundation of our plan for generations." Hence, governments at 
all levels must truly cultivate this ideology and take practical 
and effective measures to speed up educational reform and 
development. 
<H3>  VIII. Widely Opening Up Agricultural Investment Channels, 
Increasing Agricultural Construction Funds </H3>
  Thirty-eighth, huge investment is needed if we want to 
fulfill the task of agricultural construction for the nineties. 
We must try to broaden agricultural investment channels and 
drastically increase agricultural investment. Budgetary 
investment in agricultural capital construction, state financial 
aid-agriculture funds, agricultural credit funds provided by 
banks, and funds for providing relief in exchange for work are 
current channels of agricultural investment which must be 
stabilized for a long time and increased gradually. In order to 
ensure meeting the needs of agricultural investment, all 
departments in charge of planning, finance, and credit from the 
central to local levels must guarantee, in the first place, the 
supply of agricultural funds and must be determined to alter the 
situation of the small proportion of agricultural investment in 
overall investment. We must vigorously open up capital channels 
and more frequently absorb and utilize foreign investment in 
accordance with the orientation of reforming state taxation, 
monetary, investment, and foreign trade systems. We must 
capitalize on the support of departments in charge of foreign 
trade to vigorously widen the scope and increase the amount of 
utilizing foreign investment in agriculture, constantly upgrade 
the standards, and work out preferential policies. 
  Thirty-ninth, efforts must be made to urge rural collectives 
and individuals to make more investment in agriculture. We must 
work through such measures as developing township and town 
enterprises to enhance the economic strength of rural 
collectives. We must work out corresponding laws, regulations, 
and policies to ensure that rural collectives will use a certain 
proportion of accumulated capital in agriculture and guide 
peasants to make more investment in agricultural construction. 
Governments at all levels must, in accordance with local 
conditions, further perfect the labor accumulation system and 
fully utilize our country's superiority of having an abundant 
rural labor force to strengthen the construction of agricultural 
infrastructures. 
  Fortieth, forces from all social sectors must be mobilized 
to 
make more investment in agriculture. A certain proportion of 
social funds must be put together through various forms and used 
in the construction of large and medium agricultural 
infrastructures. We must vigorously integrate the development 
of agriculture with that of industry and commerce and create 
conditions to promote processing of farm produce and to enable 
enterprises engaging in transportation and marketing to invest 
in agriculture. 
  Forty-first, agricultural investment must be managed and 
used 
well and the efficiency of utilizing agricultural investment 
must be improved. Budgetary capital construction investment at 
the central and local levels must be managed in strict 
accordance with the state's administrative method of capital 
construction investment and used mainly in the construction of 
agricultural infrastructures, such as the work of harnessing 
large rivers and lakes, important state-level agricultural 
commodity production bases, large-scale key shelter-forest 
projects, the meteorological forest system, and the agricultural 
socialized service system. We must ensure that financial 
aid-agriculture funds, funds for providing relief in exchange 
for work, and bank loans for agricultural construction at the 
central and local levels must be used in strengthening 
agricultural production. Funds used by rural collectives in 
agricultural construction must be controlled by rural 
collectives and these funds should never be indiscriminately 
diverted to other uses. Efforts must be made to encourage 
peasants to use their funds in production-oriented construction. 
Nobody is allowed to violate state regulations and increase 
peasants' burdens by raising funds and apportioning expenses 
from them in any form. Nobody is allowed to seize and misuse 
peasants' funds invested in agricultural production. As far as 
the administration of funds utilized in agricultural 
construction is concerned, we must not only give play to the 
enthusiasm of departments at all levels in making more 
investment in agriculture but also establish an effective 
macroscopic regulation mechanism and lay down an overall plan 
and coordinate agricultural investment made through various 
channels, thus making joint efforts in agricultural 
construction. We must strengthen the early-stage proof of 
agricultural construction projects and take gradual steps to 
implement the project owner responsibility system and the tender 
system to improve the efficiency of utilizing agricultural 
investment. 
<H3>  IX. Strengthening Construction of the Agricultural 
Socialized Service System </H3>
  Forty-second, efforts must be made to strengthen 
construction 
of the agricultural socialized service system, which plays an 
important role in upholding the responsibility system with the 
household contract linking remuneration to output as the main 
form; perfecting the system of unified management combined with 
independent management; promoting the development of the rural 
socialist market economy; and advancing agriculture to a new 
stage. By the end of this century, a service system with 
multiple economic components, forms, and levels must be 
gradually established on the basis of rural collective and 
cooperative economic organizations and with the support of 
specialized economic and technical departments while being 
supplemented by services run by the peasants themselves. 
  Forty-third, the foci of agricultural socialized service 
work are: 1) to do a good job in the integrated services 
provided by collective economic organizations at the village 
level, which mainly include tractor-ploughing, irrigation and 
drainage, crop protection, harvesting, and transportation; 2) to 
perfect organizations at the township level, such as those 
related to farming techniques, agricultural machinery, water 
conservancy (water conservation), forestry, animal husbandry and 
veterinary science, aquatic products, management and 
administration, and meteorological services, and to do a good 
job in service work; 3) to run supply and marketing cooperatives 
and credit cooperatives well. Concerned state and collective 
technological and economic organizations must vigorously help 
peasants develop key services, such as buying and selling farm 
produce and agricultural means of production, storing, 
processing, transporting, and exporting farm produce, and 
raising funds, and insurance; 4) to do a good job in 
technological information, staff training, technological 
contracting, and other services provided by departments in 
charge of scientific research and education, information, and 
consultation; 5) to encourage the development of such 
organizations as specialized technological associations and 
research institutes and provide specialized mutual- aid 
services; 6) to set up "front-runner-type" service organizations 
for key industries in township and town enterprise and to 
provide services ranging from production to supply and marketing 
to domestic and foreign buyers. In this way, agriculture is 
provided with comprehensive services before, during, and after 
production through various service organizations. 
  Forty-fourth, all trades and departments must have the idea 
of serving peasants and agricultural production, constantly 
improve their work style, and upgrade service quality. It is 
necessary to integrate agriculture with science, education, 
industry, and commerce. Multisectoral services and functions 
must be coordinated to develop a series of comprehensive 
services which integrate agriculture with trade and industry, as 
well as with supply and marketing, and help agricultural 
socialized services develop into industries, specialties, and 
enterprises. 
  Forty-fifth, we must vigorously support peasants in 
individually and jointly running service organizations. 
Governments at all levels must support socialized service 
organizations individually and jointly run by peasants and 
protect their legitimate rights and interests. Departments in 
charge of finance, science and technology, and domestic and 
foreign trade must give their support in the forms of capital, 
technology, and material supply. 
  Forty-sixth, we must further lay down and implement polices 
which support agricultural socialized service work. We must 
support the construction of an agricultural socialized service 
system in the form of capital and bring into effect preferential 
policies in business administration and taxation enjoyed by 
concerned scientific and technological departments when setting 
up service entities. 
<H3>  X. Strengthening Leadership, Creating a Good Social 
Environment For Agricultural Development </H3>
  Forty-seventh, governments at all levels must strengthen 
their leadership over agriculture and rural work, firmly 
cultivate the ideology of stressing the foundation role of 
agriculture, and insist on treating agriculture as the top 
priority in economic work. We must frequently carry out 
investigations and studies to solve real problems related to 
agricultural development. We must take measures in light of 
local conditions, give specific guidance and, in particular, pay 
attention to supporting economic development in impoverished 
localities. We must strengthen macroscopic administration and 
regulation, ensure the supply of essential agricultural funds, 
make good arrangements for the work of producing, purchasing, 
and supplying farm produce and agricultural means of production, 
and strive to create a social environment which is favorable to 
agricultural development. 
  Forty-eighth, we must safeguard agricultural production and 
protect peasants' interests. The state implements practical 
protective policies towards agricultural production, 
particularly grain, cotton, and other farm produce with a 
bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood. 
Various trades and professions must wholeheartedly serve 
agricultural production and the peasants, protect the peasants' 
interests, and vigorously support agricultural development. 
  Forty-ninth, we must strengthen construction of the legal 
system and gradually realize the goal of using the law to rule 
and promote agriculture. We must set the propaganda and 
popularization of a number of relevant laws as the focus for 
strengthening the people's legal concept. The laws are: The 
"PRC Law on Land Administration," the "PRC Law on Forest," the 
"PRC Law on Water," the "PRC Law on Grassland," the "PRC Law on 
Fisheries," the "PRC Law on Water Conservation," the "PRC Law on 
Agriculture," and the "PRC Law on Popularization of Farming 
Techniques." We must perfect rural legal organs, do a good job 
of implementing laws in rural areas and vigorously provide legal 
consultation services in rural areas. We must speed up the work 
of formulating a complete set of laws and regulations to protect 
agricultural resources, promote agricultural production and 
circulation of farm produce, and lighten peasants' burdens. We 
must employ legal means to sternly fight against various 
practices which disrupt agricultural production, such as 
manufacturing and selling fake and inferior chemical 
fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and other agricultural means of 
production, thus bringing about stability in agricultural 
production and in the market. 
  Fiftieth, leaders and executive and administrative 
departments at all levels must, under the guidance of the 
National Program for Agricultural Development, formulate 
programs for agricultural development in light of local 
conditions and conscientiously organize forces to implement them.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 3 (CNA) -- Vice Chairman and 
Secretary-General Chiao Jen-ho of the Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) Thursday [3 February] likened relations between 
Taiwan and Mainland China to a piece of clothing that has been 
cut and needs to be re-sewn. 
  Chiao made the remarks while meeting with Wang Zhaoguo, 
director of Beijing State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, at 
the Great Hall of the People. 
  "We have to sew the cloth together slowly and patiently so 
as 
to make it flawless," Chiao said. 
  He said that mutual trust between the two sides could not be 
established overnight. 
  He said that people in Taiwan are paying great attention to 
his talks with Tang Shubei, his counterpart from the Association 
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) because they see 
the meeting as a "touchstone" in the development of the 
cross-strait relations. 
  Wang said that Chiao's trip to Beijing is conducive to the 
further acceleration of Taiwan-Mainland ties. 
  He expressed the hope that a second round of talks between 
SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS President Wang Daohan would 
take place soon. The first, historic meeting was in Singapore 
in April. 
  Chiao's negotiations with Tang continue tomorrow after 
ending 
in a stalemate again Thursday.

<F P=106> [By Yang Chin-hui; from the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] In the talks between Chiao Jen-ho and Tang Shubei 
yesterday [2 February], they failed to reach a consensuses not 
only on the ideas of judicial jurisdiction but also on the 
agreement concerning protecting Taiwan investors' rights and 
interests on the mainland. Economic issues will also be 
formally put into today's agenda, the first time for both sides 
to talk about economic issues. The following is a report by Yang 
Chin-hui. 
  [Begin recording] [Yang Chin-hui] Just as they failed to 
reach a consensus on the ideas of judicial jurisdiction, the 
Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] still stick to their 
own ideas about issues concerning protecting Taiwan investors' 
rights and interests on the mainland, another focal point of the 
Chiao-Tang talks. At the second round of the Chiao-Tang talks, 
ARATS Executive Vice Chairman Tang Shubei brought up economic 
issues for discussion. Commenting on the SEF's demand to sign 
an agreement on protecting Taiwan investors' rights and 
interests on the mainland, Tang said in a strong tone: If 
Taiwan hopes that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will sign a 
nongovernmental agreement on protecting Taiwan investors' rights 
and interests on the mainland, Taiwan should open a two-way 
channel for cross-strait economic and trade exchanges on a 
mutually beneficial and reciprocal basis. Otherwise, I would 
like to ask the SEF what Taiwan has done for Taiwan businessmen 
while the mainland has drawn up a law to protect Taiwan 
compatriots' investments on the mainland. 
  [Tang Shubei] As for Taiwan compatriots' rights and 
interests on the mainland, just as I mentioned earlier, today, 
when we see such flourishing development in the cross-strait 
economic exchanges, if two organizations [words indistinct; 
responsible for?] issues of cross-strait economic exchanges, we 
should be ashamed of ourselves for failing to live up to the 
expectations of people from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
  [Yang] SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho pointed out 
disapprovingly: The title and motives of the mainland's law on 
protecting Taiwan compatriots' investments on the mainland are 
ambiguous, its contents are impractical, and the wording is 
unacceptable. The government feels uncomfortable letting Taiwan 
businessmen invest in the mainland under conditions prescribed 
by this law. 
  [Chiao Jen-ho] Do you think our government is able to tell 
our businessmen to feel free to invest in the mainland under the 
law on protecting Taiwan compatriots' mainland investments 
passed by the so-and-so republic? I do not think their motives 
for giving this law such a title are clear and its contents are 
not practical. I do not think such wording as "other provinces" 
is acceptable to us, either. 
  [Yang] Chiao Jen-ho said how the mainland legislates laws is 
their own internal business. Our government still holds that we 
should protect Taiwan businessmen by signing agreements with the 
mainland. 
  This is special correspondent Yang Chin-hui reporting from 
Peking. [end recording]

returned to Taiwan on Tuesday from his second overseas trip in a 
month, President Li Teng-hui's private (?visit) to Indonesia was 
still in limbo and Foreign Minister Frederick Chien was reported 
of planning to resign. Chien, currently in Boston, was reported 
as wanting to resign due to frustration of the impasse to 
broaden diplomatic relations and internal opposition to 
diplomatic policies from the Legislature, local papers reported. 
Presidential aide said Li has made no concrete plans to go 
abroad, denying a local newspaper report that the president will 
leave for Bali on February 9 and will meet with Indonesian 
President Suharto. 
  Esther Kuo, a presidential spokeswoman, said that once the 
president's overseas travel plan matures, the office will 
announce that at the proper time. Kuo urged the media not to 
play up Li's possible trip, saying the (?extension) of the 
itinerary will create unnecessary trouble. She said that the 
pressure from Peking was the apparent obstacle, saying Li's 
travel plan over the past two years were aborted due to the 
similar obstacle.

  [Text] The Ministry of Economic Affairs completed the plan 
on reduction of tariffs on U.S. products yesterday [2 February]. 
It decided to flexibly reduce tariffs on 73 industrial products 
and the average reduction rate is 30 percent. In addition, it 
revised the Rules on Import Duties, reducing tariffs on 402 
agricultural and industrial products including 252 industrial 
items and 150 agricultural items. The tariffs are lowered by 
17.5 percent and 12.5 percent respectively. 
  Chiang Ping-kun, minister of Economic Affairs, said the rate 
of reduction and the number of items covered in this tariff 
reduction plan should meet U.S. demands. The Republic of China 
[ROC] and the United States should be able to hold bilateral 
talks on our entry into the General Agreement on Tariff and 
Trade [GATT] by the end of this month. 
  Both Chiang Ping-kun and Hsu Ke-sheng, vice minister of 
Economic Affairs, said that they would inform the United States 
of our tariff reduction plan as soon as possible. The Board of 
Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs will fax 
this plan to the Economic Division of the Coordination Council 
for North American Affairs today, to inform the United States of 
our tariff reduction plan and ask it to hold bilateral talks on 
our country's accession to GATT at the end of this month. The 
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative will send officials to 
Taiwan at the end of this month to hold talks on protecting 
intellectual property rights and rhinoceros horns. Therefore, 
it is possible for the ROC and United States to hold bilateral 
talks in Taipei on the ROC's accession to the GATT at the end of 
this month.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb 4 (CNA) -- Economics Minister P.K. 
Chiang Friday welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to 
lift a U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam, saying it will help 
accelerate economic reforms which will eventually benefit Taiwan 
investors. 
  The Clinton decision, announced Thursday night at the White 
House, will end an embargo imposed on Hanoi in 1964 and extended 
to the whole country at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. 
  Chiang said U.S. businesses led the rally to end the 
embargo. 
U.S. businessmen said the embargo locked them out of the 
potentially lucrative Vietnamee market while European and Asian 
nations invested hundreds of millions of dollars and secured 
development contracts there. 
  Chiang said with the lifting of the trade embargo, more 
foreign capital will flow into the burgeoning Vietnamese market, 
which will help boost incomes and buying power. 
  The country's need for machinery and consumer products from 
Taiwan will also increase, Chiang remarked. 
  Up to Jan. 19, the Vietnamese Government had approved 113 
applications by Taiwan investors for investments worth over 
US$1.53 billion, making Taiwan the No. 1 foreign investor in 
that country. 
  Chiang added that the government will continue to promote 
Taiwan investments in Vietnam, fully implementing the Republic 
of China [ROC]'s "southern strategy." 
  Two-way trade between Taiwan and Vietnam, inaugurated in 
September, 1989, jumped by a factor of five in under four years. 
  In 1993, bilateral trade totaled US$655 million with Taiwan 
enjoying a US$360 million trade surplus, according to ministry 
statistics. 
  Trade and investment ties between Vietnam and Taiwan became 
closer after the two countries signed an investment guarantee 
agreement on April 21, 1993, according to the Vietnamese 
Economic and cultural office in Taipei. 
  With the signing of the investment agreement, more and 
steady 
Taiwan investments weno to vietnam, contributing to the 
country's economic growth, said Lin Shui-chi, ROC representative 
in Vietnam. 
  "It won't take long for Vietnam to turn itself into the 
fifth 
little dragon in Asia," Lin said. 
  Taiwan previously lent Vietnam US$30 million to expand a 
highway and another US$15 million to fund the development of 
small- and medium-sized Vietnamese companies. 
  Taipei decided to lend an additional US$10 million to 
Vietnam 
last month to help the country build an industrial park in Hanoi 
to house Taiwan-invested factories.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Zhou Guangzhao, president of the </F>
Chinese Academy of Sciences, at Beijing Airport on 23 January; 
from the "Report on Current Events" program; passages within 
quotations are recorded] 
  [Text] Led by Zhou Guangzhao, president of the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences [CAS], the delegation of scientific and 
technological experts from Mainland China returned to Beijing on 
23 January from Taipei via Hong Kong. Interviewed at Beijing 
Airport, Zhou Guangzhao said that the scientific and 
technological circles on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should 
further learn from each other's strong points to supplement 
their shortcomings in order to develop both sides' science, 
technology, and economies. 
  [Zhou Guangzhau] "The delegation that visited Taiwan this 
time consisted of 25 members, including eight CAS academicians." 
  Zhou Guangzhao said: The 25 members of the delegation, 
including experts from CAS, relevant universities, the General 
Iron and Steel Research Institute of the Ministry of 
Metallurgical Industry, and the China National Nonferrous Metals 
Industry Corporation, as well as experts from a few domestic 
iron and steel corporations who are in charge of technology, 
took part in the conference on science, technology, and industry 
of both sides for 1994. At the conference, experts from both 
sides delivered many reports on iron and steel and materials and 
exchanged information in this area, touching especially on the 
prospects for cooperation in the field of rare earths. 
  Zhou Guangzhao said: Scientific and technological experts 
from mainland China attended the conference at the invitation of 
Taiwan's Institute of Industrial Technology and iron and steel 
companies; they were warmly welcomed as compatriots by their 
counterparts in Taiwan; while in Taiwan, they visited the Taiwan 
Central Research Institute, the Taiwan Institute of Industrial 
Technology, the Iron and Steel Corporation in Gaoxiong, Taiwan's 
Qinghua University, Jiaotong University, the Xinzhu 
Science-Based Industrial Park, and the Palace Museum of Taiwan. 
  Zhou Guangzhao noted: Mainland China's iron and steel output 
has topped 80 million metric tons, and further efforts will be 
made to expand production. In addition to expanding the output 
quantitatively, efforts will also be made to promote development 
qualitatively. 
  He said: There has been notable development in Taiwan's iron 
and steel industry in recent years. Although the island's steel 
output is much lower than ours, their technology is more 
advanced. To bring about a massive development of the iron and 
steel industry in Mainland China in the future, we can invite 
Taiwan counterparts to participate in certain forms of 
cooperation, including cooperation in learning from the 
automated management system for the iron and steel industry 
developed by Taiwan. 
  [Zhou]: "I think scientific and technological personnel from 
both sides are very enthusiastic about strengthening 
cross-strait scientific and technological cooperation." 
  Zhou Guangzhou, president of CAS, said: Scientific and 
technological personnel from both sides of the strait are every 
enthusiastic about strengthening cross-strait scientific and 
technological cooperation. The Taiwan counterparts we have met 
have demonstrated great interest in expanding cross-strait 
cooperation. There are many problems in scientific and 
technological cooperation, however, that require further 
improvement. For example, we are all Chinese, and we all hope 
for the peaceful reunification of China. However, at present 
there is no direct air service. Actually, the flight time from 
Beijing to Taipei is less than two hours, but to go to Taipei, 
one must go through Hong Kong. Wang Fosong, vice president of 
CAS, had planned to go to Taiwan, but he was unable to go 
because of his status. Many people in Taiwan have expressed 
their dissatisfaction with this. I believe many obstacles will 
be overcome in the days to come. 
  Zhou Guangzhao: First, we hope science and technology 
circles on both sides will strengthen cooperation and exchange 
in the area of personnel and information. In the future, both 
sides should cooperate in earnest. On the one hand they should 
cooperate in transforming scientific and technological 
achievements into productive forces and expanding the production 
of rare earths in China, which occupies an advantageous position 
in the world's rare earth resources. This is because Taiwan 
needs rare earth materials in developing its high technology. 
Taiwan can join us in making further studies on investing in 
the establishment of a rare earth joint venture enterprise. At 
present, science and technology circles of Mainland China and 
Taiwan are conducting further consultations on relevant projects 
for this year. Responsible persons from the Taiwan Institute of 
Industrial Technology will soon visit the mainland. It is 
expected that some agreements on cooperation projects may be 
concluded by the mainland and Taiwan. 
  [Zhou]: "I had always wanted to visit Taiwan. I had also 
heard many stories from people who have visited Taiwan, but to 
go there in person is different from hearing from other people. 
I really felt as if we were one family. I felt the cordiality 
and the warmth. They gave us a warm reception." 
  In conclusion, Zhou Guangzhao stressed: Through this visit 
to Taiwan we have gained some personal experience. Taiwan's 
science and technology circles have overcome difficulties, 
welcomed their counterparts from the mainland without a hitch, 
and successfully convened this beneficial conference. With 
actual deeds, they have expressed their strong desire to push 
for closer scientific and technological cooperation between both 
sides. Taiwan has made great progress in developing high 
technology, especially in the area of computers and 
microelectronic chips. Their methods of introducing new 
technologies, making use of them, and assimilating them are 
worth emulating by the mainland. Both the mainland and Taiwan 
have their strong points in developing science and technology. 
We should strengthen cooperation in this area.

<F P=106> ["Special Article" by reporter Wen Chang (3306 2512): "War </F>
Front Jinmen Is Undergoing Drastic Changes"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong 27 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--As soon as 
the "state of war" was ended in Jinmen in November 1992, a 
"craze for Jinmen" promptly surfaced, with eager tourists coming 
to the island in an endless stream, hoping to have a look at the 
famous "war front", and the "strait frontier paradise" that had 
been closed for 40-some years, but is full of opportunities for 
business. People would like to see for themselves what the 
atmosphere was like on the island. Statistics showed that in 
1993 alone, around 240,000 people in Taiwan sent in applications 
to visit Jinmen. Jinmen, the "war front" of yesterday, which 
had been shrouded in mysterious veils, has turned into a hot 
spot, which tourists are vying to visit. 
  Jinmen is located in the Xiamen Bay, only 2,310 meters away 
from mainland China at the nearest point. That being the case, 
it had long been the outpost in the confrontation between Taiwan 
and the mainland; in addition to the 40-some-year enforcement of 
martial law on the island, Jinmen had become an "out-of-bounds 
area" in the hearts of the people in Taiwan. Jinmen comprises 
15 isles of various sizes, with a total area around 17,800 
hectares, of which the two largest isles, Dajinmen and 
Xiaojinmen, account for 85 percent of the total area. According 
to 1988 statistics, its population was approximately 45,718 
(excluding troops stationed on the island); the number of people 
of Jinmen origin scattered all over the world was estimated to 
be 140,000. 
  Most inhabitants in Jinmen engage in farming. The root and 
tradition of their habits in life could be traced back to 
Fujian's Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and the residential houses on 
the island were mostly built after the traditional architectural 
style of southern Fujian. There are 40-some historic sites on 
the island, along with many places of scenic beauty. The famous 
lion-shape god [feng shi ye 7685 3740 3639,] a unique 
traditional sign of Taiwanese of Fujian origin is a peculiar 
object for human study, and was said to be a patron saint that 
had power to control storms and dispel evils and monsters, a 
popular belief; its duplicates can be found almost everywhere on 
the island. 
  Aside from historic sites, the military installation and 
sites leftover from the CPC-KMT [Kuomintang] confrontation are 
full of attraction to tourists. For example, the Guning Museum 
of War History, and the Qionglin Underground Village. 
  Since martial law was lifted and the island was opened to 
tourists, Jinmen has undergone drastic changes. The opening up 
has brought the island swarms of people as well as opportunities 
for business. Taiwan-Jinmen airline tickets are sold out most 
of the time, despite several flights back and forth every day. 
The greatest opportunity for doing business is the tourist 
industry. According to the press, hotel rooms are in short 
supply in Jinmen, and all financial groups were vying for 
stationing on the island to initiate building projects in a big 
way. Thus, many overseas Chinese or Chinese residing overseas 
of Jinmen origin, including those from Brunei, the Philippines, 
and Singapore, as well as foreign businessmen, have come to 
invest in the island one after another; that has simultaneously 
brought along development of the catering business, the movie 
and television industry, as well as the motor-driven toy 
industry. Some businessman said that whatever there were in 
Taipei, there would be in Jinmen, too; thus, gambling, drug 
addiction, and pornographic businesses were on the rise. 
Consequently, Jinmen, which used to have a simple social 
amosphere, was under violent attack. 
  Because of foreign investment swarming in, prices of 
Jinmen's 
real estates rocketed almost overnight. The indexes published 
by Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior showed that price hikes of 
Jinmen real estates topped Taiwan; last year, land prices went 
up by 60 percent over the same period of the previous year. 
Today, Jinmen's land price is approximately NT $300,000 [New 
Taiwan dollars] per ping [0988, approximately 36 square feet, a 
Japanese unit], and its land has become the most sought after in 
Taiwan. 
  To meet long-range demands, building of various 
infrastructure projects and tourist installations has 
accelerated. The Jinmen civil aviation station that costs NT$ 
820 million will be completed and delivered to use by the end of 
1995; by then there will be 25 airliners coming in or going out 
everyday; it is hoped that will bring Jinmen more tourists. 
Besides, the government has decided to build a "national party" 
in Jinmen, which will add some attraction to Jinmen's scenery. 
The people's greater concern is whether or not the 
establishment of transport, trade, and postal relations will 
first be implemented in Fujian's Xiamen, which is very close to 
Jinmen; should that be the case, Jinmen's prospects will be 
brighter still. Just like Taiwan's media put it: The golden 
gate is open when Jinmen is opening up. How can anyone remain 
indifferent facing such temptation!

<F P=106> ["Special Dispatch": "Central Leaders Lead a Delegation to </F>
Xiamen to Discuss Haicang's Development"] 
  [Text] Xiamen, 2 Feb (TA KUNG PAO) -- It has been reported 
that some 40 ministerial level officials, including officials 
responsible for making central policy decisions, will fly to 
Xiamen tomorrow evening to inspect the 20 square km of land 
originally reserved for Taiwan businessman Wang Yongqing, and 
how to develop the piece of land after it has been taken over. 
  An official of the Xiamen Haicang Management Committee 
disclosed that the visit by senior level officials from Beijing 
is the largest and highest level of its kind to Xiamen. On the 
second day after their arrival in Xiamen (4 February), they will 
conduct on-the-spot inspection for a day and then discuss what 
should be done on the 20 square km of land. 
  Reportedly, one of the topics to be discussed is what kind 
of 
industry will be developed in Haichang, whether it will continue 
to be petrochemical industry or other industries such as 
automobiles, electronics, or machine-building. 
  As for investors, it does not constitute a problem. A number 
tycoons of Chinese origin in Southeast Asia have expressed on 
numerous occasions their interest in investing in Haicang. When 
an official announcement is made by China on Wang Yongqing's 
withdrawal from the zone, they are willing to invest in Haicang 
and develop whatever industries China propose. They may even 
fly to Beijing or Xiamen on the second day to hold talks on 
investment. 
  The move of senior Beijing officials is apparently unusual. 
It indicates that Haicang is a development zone of Xiamen and 
also a state-level development zone directly under control of 
the central authorities. The move also declares an end to "Wang 
Yongqing's investment in Haicang," which had created a furor, 
and a new period for Haicang's development. 
  Su Zengtian, deputy secretary of Xiamen CPC Committee and 
executive deputy director of the Haicang Management Committee, 
said today: It is estimated that the decision of the central 
government on the 20 square km of land will be made public 
sometime in March or April. Whatever the result, it will 
definitely be a big project, which will bring along other 
trades. By then, Haicang will become a very popular place 
attracting investment from all sides.

  [Text] Nanjing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- In rural Jiangsu 
Province in east China, one can find that most of the finer 
buildings are schools and people with higher incomes are those 
with expertise. 
  The province, with farm families accounting for 78 percent 
of 
its total population, has witnessed good results in pushing 
provincial development forward through a campaign aimed at 
educating and training those in the countryside to make them 
more adaptable to the market economy. 
  The campaign has swept through Jiangsu's 27 cities and 
counties and some 440 towns, stressing vocational training and 
adult education, in addition to ordinary schooling. 
  For example, largely due to the movement, 14,000 out of 
15,000 poor households have been lifted out of poverty in 
Huaiyin county, a remote backwater area of the province. 
  Statistics show that the province holds 3,000 training 
classes annually, enrolling 110,000 people, several thousands of 
whom are then given technical titles. 
  A survey shows that in Jiangyin city, whose output value 
from 
township enterprises reached 20 billion yuan, more than 85 
percent of the managers and 90 percent of the skilled workers 
are from those training classes. 
  Nantong city, where 300 construction teams formed by 
peasants 
bring in an annual output value of five billion yuan, has 
launched two specialized schools for builders, with about 10,000 
persons having passed examinations. 
  And Changshu city has injected some 10 million yuan into 
technological schools for adults in 32 towns in recent years. 
Nearly 1,000 graduates have been employed as engineers, 
certified accountants and managers. 
  Moreover, institutions of higher education have emerged in 
the province's rural areas. 
  China's first village-launched college was set up recently 
in 
Yanshan village, which grossed 600 million yuan last year. 
  And Huaxi village, a reform pioneer, has established a 
training center focusing on foreign language and foreign trade. 
  Experts hold that the campaign has also contributed much to 
the local agricultural research force. 
  Wuxi county, whose industrial output value is second to none 
in the country, boasts rural China's largest scientific base, 
involving some 100 research institutions in the fields of 
metallurgy, electronics, biology and machinery. The county's 
rural network has trained thousands of peasant-turned scientists. 
  In 1993, over 110,000 township enterprises in the province 
recorded 400 billion yuan in industrial output value, up 58.9 
percent over the previous year. 
  Also in the past year, the peasants in the province launched 
4,670 new enterprises involving 3.6 billion U.S. dollars of 
overseas investment. They have also set up 200 businesses in 36 
countries and regions.

  [Text] Nanjing, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Expansion of the 
Lusi Port on the Chang Jiang River estuary has aroused great 
interest among foreign business people. 
  Located in east China's Jiangsu Province, which faces the 
newly-rising Pudong area zone in Shanghai, Lusi received 50 
groups of foreign investors last year. 
  After feasibility studies, Chinese and foreign experts 
agreed 
that the port is a natural link on the marine lines from Dalian 
in the northeast to Ningbo in the east and to Hong Kong in the 
south. 
  It is suitable for building at least 100 berths to 
accommodate ships of 10,000-dwt and 20 deepwater berths for 
100,000-dwt ships. 
  The port is listed in the national port planning and 
construction program, and will be developed into an 
international port soon.

  [Text] In 1993, the province made good achievements in 
carrying out industrial adjustment. Fifty-two enterprises 
fulfilled a total industrial output value of 11.23 billion yuan, 
an increase of 16.4 percent over the previous year; 18.5 percent 
of the gross industrial output value of industrial enterprises 
was at the township level and above. They realized 2.13 billion 
yuan in profits and taxes, an increase of 30.9 percent, 
accounting for 81.5 percent of the total taxes and profits of 
industrial enterprises throughout the province. Thirty-six 
industrial enterprises realized more than 10 million yuan in 
annual profits and taxes. The Jiangxi Xiyi Steel and Iron 
Factory, the Jiangxi Automobile Factory, the Nanchang Cigarette 
Factory, the Gannan Cigarette Factory, and the Nanchang Steel 
and Iron Factory topped 100 million yuan in annual profits and 
taxes. 
  Industrial enterprises which have paid high taxes and 
delivered much profit have three characteristics. 
  First, they made continuous progress and increased 
production 
and incomes by taking advantage of the good situation. The 
Jiangxi Xiyi Steel and Iron Factory fulfilled the target of 1 
million metric tons of multi-type steel, ranking first in the 
province in tax payment and profit delivery. The Jiangxi Cement 
Factory produced 95 metric tons of cement, a record high. 
  Second, they increased their investments and fulfilled 
production quotas. The Jiangxi Automobile Factory doubled the 
production of Jiangling brand automobiles and realized taxes and 
profits of 353 million yuan, ranking second in the province. 
The Jiujiang Chemical Fiber Factory achieved good results in 
carrying out technical transformation, which helped double its 
economic returns. 
  Third, they introduced structural adjustment to cope with 
market demands. The Nanchang Cigarette Factory paid attention 
to improving product quality and upgrading products. In 1992 it 
suffered a loss of 28.52 million yuan, but last year it made up 
this deficit and began to gain profits.

2638 2429): "Great Vistas Are One Step Ahead--Shanghai Mayor 
Huang Ju on Speeding Up Reform and Opening Up"] 
  [Text] Shanghai 16 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--A popular saying 
goes: "Great vistas are one step back," so that one may show 
tolerance toward others while getting ahead in life. Today, 
referring to one of Shanghai's experiences in accelerating 
reform and opening up, Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju said: "Great 
vistas are one step ahead." 
  Huang Ju had just arrived in Beijing to report on the work 
of 
Shanghai and had long talks with Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu 
Rongji. He left Beijing for Shanghai by train only yesterday 
(15 Jan) morning, and immediately convened a meeting for the 
Shanghai Municipal Government's senior officials. The meeting 
lasted an entire day and concluded only at dusk. At noon today, 
he met with this paper's responsible person and discussed 
Shanghai's accomplishments of recent years and future 
development with full confidence. "Vast vistas are one step 
ahead" was a summation of the province's experiences as well as 
the direction for future development. 
<H3>  Support From the Central Authorities, Shanghai's Efforts To 
Bring Credit to China </H3>
  Huang Ju said that Shanghai had found good opportunities 
while undergoing great changes over the past two years and 
pointed out that that was an impetus to all of China as well as 
the consequence of the entire country's support in urging 
Shanghai on. Briefly, he generalized the situation into three 
phrases: The Central Authorities' concern, support from the 
entire country, and Shanghai's efforts to bring credit to China. 
  Huang Ju revealed that, when Deng Xiaoping came to Shanghai 
early last year, he offered encouragement with the following 
remarks: It is hoped that Shanghai will brave the wind and 
waves in the new year, advance with steady steps, and overcome 
difficulties to scale new heights. Huang Ju said that Shanghai 
had exerted efforts to bring credit to China by making some 
changes every year and effecting great changes within three 
years. In 1993, Shanghai actually made some accomplishments. 
  Huang Ju said that he told the Central leading members that 
Shanghai's economic changes were not unitary, but were entirely 
directional. The primary change was that the economic growth 
rate was sustained, healthy, and rapid [as published] and the 
quality of economic operations scaled a new height. 
  He indicated that Shanghai's growth rate in 1992 and 1993 
(with an increase of 14.8 and 14.9 percent respectively) had 
doubled the growth rate of the 1980's. Particularly rapid 
development was seen in tertiary industry, which accounted for 
38 percent of the GNP; it was originally planned that this 
industry would account for 40 or 45 percent of GNP by the year 
2000, and now it seems that this could be achieved in 1994. 
Tertiary industry had already made great strides. 
  Huang Ju stressed that, in development, Shanghai needed a 
market, quality, and economic returns. He said: "A good growth 
rate without a market will be ineffective; similarly, a good 
rate that is not backed up by certain progress in development 
does not reflect Shanghai's due status; and a satisfactory rate 
that does not produce economic returns is useless." He cited 
industry as an example. Last year, the output-marketing ratio 
was 98.8 percent, and the national average output-marketing 
ratio was between 92 and 94 percent. An output-marketing ratio 
of 97 percent is universally acknowledged as a healthy ratio 
throughout the world. 
  He indicated that Shanghai's GNP growth rate was 2 
percentage 
points higher than the nation's average, which was beyond one's 
imagination in the past; furthermore, the growth in financial 
revenues was higher than that of GNP. Last year, financial 
revenues increased by 30 percent -- 15 percentage points higher 
than GNP growth -- an unprecedented event in the history of 
Shanghai's development. Of course, that figure should not be 
too high, for it would not be normal. 
  Recalling the three occasions of marcoeconomic regulation 
and 
control in the 1980s, Huang Ju said that, during the ups and 
downs at that time, the downswing was faster, had a wider scope, 
and was slower to turn around. We hoped that, in the 1990's, 
the downswing would be slower, would have a narrower scope, and 
would be quick in turning around, so that the negative effects 
of fluctuation on Shanghai would be minimized. Shanghai 
achieved this in 1993 as it benefited from national 
macroeconomic regulation and control. 
  He said that the marked increase in Shanghai's financial 
revenues had its own peculiarity, which was related to the fact 
that Shanghai had built several large markets over the past 
three years, including the monetary, securities, and production 
materials markets. If we look at the securities market for 
example, we notice that the transaction volume in 1993 was 520 
billion yuan. All this showed that the changes in Shanghai were 
not easily achieved. It would have been impossible had it not 
been for the principle of reform, the results of restructuring 
in the previous five years, and the support of the state's large 
markets. Such changes fall in line with the market trend. 
  Regarding the people's living standards, the per capita 
income of Shanghai workers and staffers was 5,520 yuan in 1993, 
up by 30 percent from the previous year; taking inflation into 
account, the net increase was 8.2 percent. Between 1991 and 
1990, prices rose 50 percent overall in Shanghai, and the wages 
of workers and staffers doubled. 
<H5>  Per Capita Income Exceeded 5,000 Yuan Last Year </H5>
  Great changes have taken place in Shanghai's urban 
construction in recent years. Huang Ju said that the man in the 
street could observe this directly; some foreign businessmen 
have said that things had changed after being away from the city 
for three months, and some people have even exaggerated, saying 
that Shanghai is changing everyday. Huang Ju said that, last 
year, Shanghai pursued 46 urban construction projects, with an 
investment of 14.6 million yuan, accounting for two-thirds of 
the total investment in urban construction in the 1980's. 
Shanghai had lagged far behind in construction in the past, 
because it had not undertaken any building projects for 40 
years. Central leaders visited Shanghai and said that the city 
had changed. The current Shanghai Government accelerated 
construction on the basis of its predecessor; it was making up 
for the past and trying to avoid lagging behind once again in 
order to meet the needs of the new situation. 
  According to Huang Ju, one of the characteristics of urban 
construction is to pay attention to housing construction; 5 
million square meters of floor space was completed in 1992, and 
this figure reached 6 million in 1993. Hopefully, 7 million 
square meters of floor space will be created this year. Should 
the situation develop in this direction, by 1997 or 1998, 
Shanghai will have done away with all old houses that are not 
equipped with toilets and gas stoves. 
  Huang Ju believed that Shanghai's urban construction 
embodied 
many aspects of the spirit of China's socialist construction; 
for example, urban construction should fall in line with the 
direction of market economic restructuring. Shanghai has 
primarily been pursuing installations that are urgently required 
for market economic construction; for example, the Yangpu Bridge 
was completed within two years, and Yanggao Road (Pudong's trunk 
line) was completed in 1992, the very same year that it broke 
ground. In capital construction, a strategy of focusing efforts 
on completing a project was adopted to embody the advantages of 
socialism, while observing international construction standards 
to ensure Shanghai's level, quality, rate, and economic returns. 
  Huang Ju revealed that a U.S. expert had told him after a 
visit to Shanghai that it was impossible to do such things in 
such a short period. 
  He called on the building industry to focus on building 
houses whenever funds were available to reduce effects on 
residents and to complete the project as quickly as possible 
once it broke ground. He said that, to reassure the public, 
there must be a notice which includes when the project would 
break ground, when it would be completed, and whom should be 
contacted if problems appear. Ordinary people were to be the 
ones who finally checked and accepted the houses, and prominent 
individuals involved in the construction would cut the ribbon at 
the opening ceremony. 
<H3>  Calling on the People To Be Well-Informed and Support 
Construction </H3>
  Regarding key projects in urban construction, it was 
required 
that ordinary people "should be well-informed and show 
understanding through support and participation." There were 
times, however, when some departments might fail to understand 
and give their support; under such circumstances, Municipal 
Party Committee Secretary Wu Bangguo would speak on behalf of 
the municipal party committee in support of the government's 
decision. 
  There was a flood in 1991. It was a year of price reform, 
the year that restrictions were first lifted from vegetable 
prices, and it involved great difficulties. Some people 
believed that the mayor was too bold in conducting price reform. 
Through study, the municipal government believed it to be 
feasible; however, some people at the grass-roots level were not 
convinced. Again, Wu Bangguo expressed where he stood on behalf 
of the municipal party committee and supported the government's 
move to lift restrictions from vegetable prices. Consequently, 
by the end of the year, Shanghai had smoothly tided over the 
difficulties, and the market was reinvigorated. 
  Huang Ju had been to Japan studying modern administration. 
He generalized some important experiences regarding the 
administration of China advancing toward a modern metropolitan 
environment. He said that Shanghai should go by the sequence of 
reform, development, and stability; namely, should put reform 
above all else and promote development with reform, for only 
development under the mechanism of reform was effective reform. 
Only stability at a new level achieved through reform and 
development was genuine stability. However, regarding specific 
reform measures, the sequence should be the other way round; 
namely, the growth rate and the scope of reform should be 
determined by the bearing capacity of stability. Otherwise, it 
would amount to twice the work with half the results. 
<H3>  Launching Second Round of Reform by Taking Initiative in 
Shanghai's Own Hands </H3>
  Huang Ju stressed that, in leading economic work, it was 
necessary to seek truth from facts, adapt to local conditions, 
give categorized guidance, and comply with Chinese 
characteristics as well as the characteristics of the times and 
Shanghai. Huang Ju once said that "to be one step ahead, it is 
imperative to move one step sideways." When this statement 
became known, it changed into "Huang Ju does not want 
leadership." Huang Ju explained that this statement meant that, 
to be one step ahead in reform, it was imperative to take one 
step away from other fraternal provinces and municipalities, to 
the effect that Shanghai did not have to follow the nation's 
unified pattern in pursuing construction. He cited an example, 
saying that the Shanghai municipal government set out the need 
to do a good job of internal and external balance in accordance 
with Shanghai's actual conditions. Shanghai's practice, 
however, should not be presented to the entire nation, just like 
Shanghai could not copy Hong Kong's way of doing things. He 
said that China was too large a country, and conditions in 
various places are different; China opposed rushing headlong 
into mass action, breaking up in pandemonium, or requiring 
unanimity in everything. 
  Huang Ju said that Shanghai had told the Central Committee 
where it stood; specifically, under the prerequisites of 
socialism, central unified leadership, and central unified 
macroeconomic regulation and control, Shanghai would not hand 
over a penny less than the central government required. Huang 
Ju said he might as describe it as "financing reform with 
self-raised funds, conducting reform by personally taking the 
initiative, and taking the lead in reform." 
  He added that, during his most recent trip to Beijing, he 
expressed the hope that, under the prerequisites of central 
unified leadership, unified macroeconomic regulation and 
control, and the unified market of the whole country, Shanghai 
could be ensured of a market, quality, and economic returns, 
while conducting the second round of reform by taking the 
initiative in the city's own hand. 
  Happily, Huang Ju said, the Central Authorities supported 
this idea, and he indicated that Shanghai presently enjoys the 
best opportunities, most favorable geographical position, and 
greatest support of the people since the PRC's founding. 
Shanghai citizens saw this point, too. Even though they might 
have some complaints about the municipal administration and 
aired their grievances, they do not really harbor anger in their 
hearts.

  According to statistics, Shanghai approved 300 projects 
funded by business people from 20 countries and regions in 
January. These projects involved a combined investment of more 
than 550 million U.S. dollars. 
  An official of the municipal Commission for Foreign 
Relations 
and Trade said that Hong Kong business people still take the 
lead in investing in Shanghai -- followed by Taiwan, Japan and 
the United States. 
  Of these projects, 229 are industrial ones and the rest are 
involved in the service trades. 
  By the end of last month, the official noted, Shanghai had a 
total of 7,239 projects funded by business people from 54

<F P=106> [By Shen Zhenzhong (3088 2182 0022): "Deepening Reform, </F>
Improving Infrastructure, Developing Markets, Upgrading Quality, 
and Bringing About a Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy Economic 
Growth in Zhejiang"] 
  [Text] A provincial economic work conference was held in 
Hangzhou yesterday. At the conference, Governor Wan Xueyuan 
delivered a speech on implementing guidelines of the national 
economic work conference and the ninth provincial CPC congress, 
and on doing a good job in this year's economic work. 
  Vice Governor Chai Songyue presided over yesterday's 
conference. Among the other provincial government leaders 
present at the conference were Liu Xirong, Long Anding, Zhang 
Qimei, and Xu Zhichun. 
  In his speech, Wan Xueyuan first analyzed the current 
economic situation and said: Under the leadership of the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council, governments at various 
levels in the province have firmly grasped the central task of 
economic construction, and have made new achievements in 
deepening reform and stepping up development in 1993. First, 
having achieved a higher economic growth rate in the previous 
year, Zhejiang still maintained the trend of rapid growth. 
Second, following the guidelines of the central authorities, 
Zhejiang paid attention to making due efforts in straightening 
out financial and taxation order and has accomplished positive 
achievements in macroeconomic regulation and control. Third, 
centered around the establishment of a socialist market economic 
system, Zhejiang has taken new action in reform and opening up. 
One of the important features in last year's economic work was: 
While strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, 
Zhejiang continued to maintain a higher economic growth rate and 
take a still greater step in reform and opening up, and 
accumulating preliminary experience for doing a good job in 
macroeconomic regulation and control under new economic 
conditions in the future. 
  Wan Xueyuan said: The year 1994 is an important year for 
comprehensively promoting reform and continuing to step up 
economic development. It is also a year of crucial importance 
to the implementation of the 8th Five-Year Plan. The 
international and domestic environments will provide favorable 
conditions for a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth 
this year. The reform in the systems of taxation, banking, 
investment, foreign trade, and management of state assets will 
offer more opportunities for accelerating economic development, 
and Zhejiang will continue to expect a favorable trend in 
economic development this year. Naturally, some contradictions 
inherent in the economic life remain to be solved, and after the 
release of the central authorities' significant reform measures, 
the impact of the friction aroused from the transfer of the old 
system to the new one on Zhejiang's economic development at a 
certain stage brooks no underestimation. Despite many 
difficulties, opportunity is still the priority. We should 
fully recognize the favorable conditions for reform and 
development, and seize the opportune moment to promote reform 
and step up development. 
  Wan Xueyuan expounded the guiding ideology and tasks for 
provincial economic work this year. The guiding ideology for 
this year's economic work is: Comprehensively carry out 
the guidelines of the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and the 9th provincial CPC congress; further 
emancipate the minds; seize the opportunity; deepen reform; 
improve infrastructure; develop markets; upgrade quality; bring 
about a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth; promote 
social and political stability; and strive for basically 
fulfilling various targets of the Eighth Five-Year Plan one year 
ahead of schedule. 
  Speaking on further emancipating minds and intensifying 
reform, Wang Xueyuan said: In reforming the macro system, we 
should follow the national plan and take the initiative in 
adapting to this plan on the basis of Zhejiang's actual 
situation. After we have adopted the new financial and tax 
systems, we should make genuine efforts to shift the focus of 
our financial and tax work to readjusting the industrial 
structure and product mix, achieving higher economic returns, 
tapping new tax resources that will increase our revenues, and 
striving to make a bigger "cake." According to the demands of 
the CPC Central Committee, we should conscientiously reform the 
systems governing banking and investment affairs, the management 
of fixed state-owned assets, and the management of external 
economic relations. 
  The reform of the property rights system will be the center 
of this year's reform. In accordance with the requirements set 
for modern enterprises, we should categorize various projects 
and achieve breakthroughs in key areas. Collective enterprises 
in urban and rural areas should carry out the corporate system, 
and some fair-sized private enterprises should also be guided to 
adopt the corporate system. Large and medium state-owned 
enterprises should be restructured to become corporations, most 
enterprises should be restructured to become limited-liability 
companies, and some enterprises should be turned into 
incorporated companies. As for those small enterprises and 
those operationally hopeless medium enterprises, they should be 
handled with even more flexible measures. Some may be leased or 
auctioned off, some may become collectively or independently 
operated units, and some may go bankrupt. Under the premise of 
ensuring the dominant role of public ownership, positive efforts 
should be made to develop private economies. 
  To supplement the modern enterprise system, we should 
quicken 
the pace of cultivating the market system, and give priority to 
cultivating markets of important production ingredients such as 
banking, property rights transfer, labor, technology, real 
estate, and capital goods. The reform of the social security 
system is a very important supplementary reform vital to whether 
enterprise reform can go deeper. It is also important for 
maintaining social stability. The general orientation of the 
reform is to break the bounds among workers of various 
enterprises; consolidate the management, separate enterprises 
from the government, and adopt different measures in urban and 
rural areas. The cost should be rationally borne by three sides 
-- the state, units, and individuals. We must speed up 
restructuring of the urban housing system. While focusing on 
selling public-owned quarters, we should "sell, rent, and build" 
living quarters at the same time to quicken the construction of 
urban housing projects -- especially those housing projects for 
easing housing congestion and affordable housing projects for 
low-income people -- and promote the construction of living 
quarters sold as a commodity. 
  Speaking on heightening the awareness of opening up and 
developing an open economy, Wan Xueyuan said: The key for 
Zhejiang to develop an open economy and open up wider to the 
outside world still lies in further heightening the awareness of 
opening up. We should perfect Zhejiang's development strategy 
by putting ourselves in the great international environment, and 
adjust Zhejiang's economic structure according to the 
requirements set for an open economy. This year we should 
launch a provincial campaign to remobilize and reeducate the 
people on the need to heighten the awareness of opening up and 
opening wider to the outside world and seize current 
opportunities at home and abroad to promote Zhejiang's external 
economic relations to a new level. 
  To develop an open economy, we should open wider to the 
outside world by following the plan drawn up by the provincial 
party committee and the provincial government. In foreign 
trade, we should do a good job in linking up the old and new 
systems to guarantee a smooth transition. We should 
systematically rewrite the rules governing property rights of 
foreign trade enterprises, and their organization and 
management. We must have a stronger concept for developing 
"sizable economy and trade" and encourage all quarters to earn 
more foreign exchange through expanding export. We should 
continue to steadily develop businesses of contracting foreign 
projects, exporting labor services, and providing consultative 
services for designs so that we can promote export of equipment 
and ordinary commodities through economic ties, trade, and 
technological services. We should actively and steadily develop 
enterprises abroad and encourage overseas enterprises with the 
necessary resources to gradually develop into overseas 
enterprise groups with multiple functions such as production, 
trade, export of labor services, bringing in foreign capital, 
and training qualified personnel. 
  Speaking on intensifying the construction of agriculture and 
the infrastructure to lay a firm foundation for stepping up 
economic development, Wan Xueyuan said: The role of agriculture 
has become even more important as the foundation of Zhejiang's 
economy. Governments at various levels and all departments 
concerned must implement the measures set by the rural work 
conference to the letter. It is necessary to use various 
economic and administrative means to keep the sown area for 
grain at a certain level. First, the fields for growing grain 
must not be left uncultivated; we must take necessary 
administrative measures, intensify supervision, and speed up the 
cultivation of such fields. Second, it is necessary to control 
the farmland that switches to new crops after growing certain 
crops for years. Third, we should increase economic returns by 
improving and popularizing strains of grain, promoting economies 
of scale, and running well the sophisticated processing of grain 
and cooking oil. We should continue to readjust and optimize 
the structure of Zhejiang's agricultural production and take the 
advantage of the province's supremacy in diversified 
agricultural production to actually push the agricultural 
production to the market. The development of village and town 
enterprises, and high-yield, high-efficiency, and fine-quality 
agriculture are the two wheels carrying our rural areas toward 
market and overall development; we should continue to promote 
the process of turning rural areas into markets through 
deepening reform in accordance with the principle of making 
progress in the course of development and developing in the 
course of reform. We should stabilize the right of contracting 
land and make good use of land use rights. The economies of 
scale in agriculture should be vigorously promoted in areas 
where rural economy develops at a faster pace to raise the level 
of socialized division of labor and coordination in agriculture. 
The partnership system in the form of stock sharing should be 
popularized and promoted in village and town enterprises, and 
energetic support should be given to sizable village and town 
enterprises in re-organization and transformation so they will 
be upgraded to a new level. In the meantime, the partnership 
system in the form of stock sharing should also be promoted in 
various sectors such as rural plantations, aquatic product 
breeding, and circulation as soon as possible. Regarding this 
year's work on rural areas, agriculture, and peasants, we should 
strive to increase peasants' income: On the one hand, we should 
vigorously expand production and strive for a good harvest of 
agricultural production, particularly grain, cotton, cooking 
oil, and vegetables. We should increase peasants' income 
through developing high-yield, high-efficiency, and fine-quality 
agriculture as well as developing village and town enterprises 
and private enterprises. On the other hand, we should continue 
to look to the work of reducing peasants' burden, step up the 
formulation of laws and regulations, standardize the collection 
of fees from peasants, and protect peasants' interests. We 
should continue to make greater efforts to eliminate poverty, 
step up the pace of relocating people in order to improve their 
living standards, and attach importance to anti-poverty policies. 
  Speaking on strengthening the construction of the 
infrastructure, Wan Xueyuan said: We must keep the idea of 
advancing ahead of others in mind, and pool the strength of the 
entire society to steadfastly construct Zhejiang's key 
infrastructure including transportation, power supply, 
telecommunications, and water conservancy. We should come up 
with more ideas for raising funds and, along with the reform in 
the investment system, constantly deepen the reform in the 
system of investing in infrastructure such as transportation, 
power supply, telecommunications, and water conservancy. We 
should gradually introduce the corporate system and improve and 
perfect the responsibility system of investment by legal 
entities. 
  Speaking on using the market as a guide, and scientific and 
technological progress as a motive force to raise the quality of 
economic growth, Wan Xueyuan said: As market forces play an 
increasingly bigger role and as reform deepens, market 
competition will become increasingly fierce and economic growth 
achieved through the increase of output will be more difficult 
to sustain. We will lose many markets if we do not step up 
readjustment of our industrial structure, pay more attention to 
product quality, and increase economic returns. We must ensure 
tangible progress in this year's economic work. First, we must 
pay attention to the economy of scale and raise the standards of 
our industry-based economy. While continuing to maintain the 
vitality of our "light and small" enterprises by raising the 
level of cooperation in their specialized fields, we must select 
large and high-standard projects when we establish new 
enterprises. Particularly in developed coastal areas, we must 
raise the threshold of new projects and approach the question 
from the viewpoint of restructuring the province's industry. On 
no account should we launch low-standard, duplicate processing 
industrial projects. Second, we must adjust product mixes and 
raise product qualities. We must guide enterprises in 
vigorously developing readily salable new products and new 
varieties in different categories to satisfy consumers in 
different sectors and at different levels; and at the same time, 
we must earnestly protect the reputation of Zhejiang's products 
by mercilessly cracking down on the manufacture and sale of 
substandard and fake products. To raise the quality of 
Zhejiang's products, we must rely on science and technology and 
education, intensify technological transformation, and encourage 
technology research and new product development. We must select 
a number of industries to carry out industry-wide technological 
transformation. In accordance with the demand to industrialize 
scientific and technological undertakings, transform research 
institutions into enterprises, and commercialize scientific and 
technological achievements to sell them in the market, we must 
actively reform our science and technology management structure, 
and establish and develop a mechanism that encourages 
enterprises to take the initiative to obtain scientific and 
technological research results. We should put more emphasis on 
training practical personnel in schools. We should deepen 
education reform and step up training talented personnel, using 
the resources of our entire society. Third, we must step up our 
efforts to develop backbone industries. We must further work 
out sound plans to develop electric, machinery, textile, silk, 
chemical, food, and building materials industries, and draw up 
specific plans for implementing development of such industries 
as power and telecommunications equipment, transportation 
equipment, pharmaceuticals, construction machinery, new-type 
high-grade synthetic materials, and new-type building materials. 
  Speaking of ways to show earnest concern for and arrange 
well 
the people's daily life, and to do tangible things for them, Wan 
Xueyuan said: This year's reform will enter a period during 
which difficult problems will be tackled. We must not take the 
price situation lightly. Governments at all levels must show 
concern for and arrange well the people's daily life and 
earnestly do some good things for the people from the viewpoint 
of stabilizing the general situation and society, and ensuring 
the smooth progress of reform. First, we must make adequate 
arrangements for the people's food and vegetables. To resolve 
the problem of "vegetable basket," we must first stabilize and 
develop vegetable bases; second, actively create conditions to 
gradually set up funds to regulate the prices of vegetables, 
pigs, and other products; and third, implement sound reform of 
the vegetable circulation structure, and cultivate and establish 
a market system. The price issue involves the question of the 
capacity of our budget, enterprises, and masses to tolerate the 
changes, and the question of social stability. We must do 
everything possible to successfully manage the market and 
increase the residents' income and effective supply. We must 
continue to strengthen our supervision and control of commodity 
prices and strictly forbid speculation and hoarding to jack up 
commodity prices and manipulate the market so as to reap 
exorbitant profits. We must bring into full play the role of 
public opinion and the masses in monitoring commodity prices. 
We must establish a mechanism promoting normal income growth 
and do our utmost to ensure that the increase in workers' wages 
exceeds the level of price increases. 
  Wan Xueyuan stressed: Our tasks related to reform, 
development, and stability are extremely heavy this year. New 
situations and problems will continue to emerge. To achieve our 
economic goals, governments at all levels must pay particular 
attention to and strengthen leadership over economic work. 
First, we must change the government's leadership functions in 
economic work. Second, we must intensify study, investigation, 
and research. Third, we must strengthen leadership and pay 
close attention to implementation. While conducting economic 
work, governments at all levels should also firmly uphold the 
policy of fostering both material and cultural and ideological 
progress, and attach equal importance to both. We must pay 
close attention to building spiritual civilization, 
comprehensively tackling problems of public order, building a 
clean government, and carrying out other undertakings of social 
development. Wan Xueyuan concluded by urging everyone to use 
their brains, spend more time on the question of development, 
and pay more attention to stability. He asked them to think 
ahead, boldly practice, have the courage to lead and make 
breakthroughs, seek development in the course of reform, and 
deepen reform in the process of development. At the same time, 
he urged them to pay particular attention to social and economic 
stability, and set people's minds at ease. 
  Responsible comrades from various city (prefectural) and 
county governments as well as provincial departments attended 
the meeting. Meetings on planning, economic work, financial 
work, economic restructuring, and foreign relations and trade 
were simultaneously held.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 17 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- 
According to statistics issued by the Guangzhou City industrial 
and commercial administration, more than 2,300 cases of fake and 
imitation goods -- involving a total value of 8.78 million yuan 
or more -- were reported, investigated, and handled in the city 
last year. The confiscated fake and imitation goods fall into 
more than 40 categories. 
  These fake and imitation goods seized in Guangzhou range 
from 
capital goods to daily necessities and from general commodities 
to high-class consumer goods. Large quantities of commodities 
were confiscated last year, including color television sets, 
video recorders, lubricant, toiletry soaps, cement, agricultural 
chemicals, human leukocyte interferon [ren bai xi bao gan rao su 
0086 4101 4798 5165 1626 2371 4790], garments, cigarettes, 
alcoholic drinks, low-voltage electric appliances, and cosmetics. 
  Reports have indicated that fake and imitation goods 
manufacturers in Guangzhou are now expanding from small 
partnerships into collectively owned enterprises. In some 
areas, they have even been operating on a fairly large scale. 
They mostly fabricate goods to imitate quality foreign and 
local brand-name products, and their skill in copying is so 
perfect that the imitation goods can hardly be distinguished 
from the genuine ones. 
  Last year, Guangzhou City's industrial and commercial 
administration focused its attention on fighting the illegal 
manufacture and sale of fake and imitation goods. With clues 
reported by local residents, the industrial and commercial 
administrative bureau of Baiyun district discovered and searched 
an illegal processing workshop producing fake high-grade 
lubricant bearing the "Mobil" brand name and confiscated more 
than 1,900 cans of the lubricant as well as some empty cartons 
and cans.

  [Text] An enlarged meeting of the party committee of the 
Henan armed police force headquarters closed yesterday, having 
lasted for four days. 
  During the meeting, Henan Governor Ma Zhongchen delivered an 
important speech on the province's reform and development, as 
well as the armed police force's role in the new period. In his 
speech Ma Zhongchen expressed his appreciation for the efforts 
and contributions made by the members of the armed police force 
in the past year to the province's economic construction. 
Having briefed the participants on the province's overall plan 
for economic development for the current year, Ma said: This 
year will see Henan Province undergoing the most intensive 
reform. In the wake of the introduction of some reformatory 
measures and the adjustment of interest relations, it is certain 
that some new circumstances and new problems will be emerging, 
and some unstable factors will be coming to the surface as well. 
When performing its duties, the armed police force is to do 
away with these unstable factors before they gain ground. In 
doing so the armed police force is supporting reform and 
development. Amid the great tide of reform, the armed police 
force will be playing still more important a role. Therefore 
you are expected to conscientiously sum up experience, work 
harder, strive for greater progress, and make greater 
contributions.

  [Excerpts] A provincial judicial work meeting ended today. 
During discussions with leaders of prefectural and city party 
committees on the evening of 28 January, Liu Rongli, secretary 
of the provincial commission for political science and law, 
stressed: We should firmly carry out the instructions of the 
party Central Committee and the provincial party committee on 
legal work, make comprehensive arrangements in light of local 
conditions, bring focal points into prominence, and be strict in 
work to ensure political stability and social tranquility 
throughout the province and to promote the smooth carrying out 
of reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  Liu Rongli continued: A task of primary importance at 
present is to preserve social stability in a down-to-earth 
manner, to put into effect all policies and measures, and to 
strike severe blows at serious criminal offenses. [passage 
omitted] Leaders should pay close attention to wherever public 
security is chaotic, including highways and railways, should 
concentrate their efforts on rectifying social order in these 
places, and should not stop this rectification until social 
order changes for the better. 
  Liu Rongli stressed the need to strengthen party leadership 
over judicial work and to speed up improvement of the judicial 
contingent. The key to fulfilling the heavy tasks in judicial 
work is to build a good judicial contingent, to improve the 
political and professional quality of judicial cadres, and to 
raise their law enforcement ability. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Wuhan, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei 
Province invested over five billion yuan to cover the 
construction of basic facilities involving transport, posts and 
telecommunications, and the power industry last year. 
  Local officials said the investment made up 30 percent of 
the 
province's entire investment in fixed assets. 
  Hubei overfulfilled its targets of opening and installing 
190,000 new telephone lines, increasing generating capacity by 
1.46 million kw, and completing 2,600 km of new high-grade 
highways in the past year. 
  In addition, the province has also opened 50 domestic and 
overseas air routes. 
  The Tianhe international airport in this provincial capital 
has finished its extension work and will go back into operation 
next month. Two other airports capable of handling Boeing jets 
in Enshi, the prefectural seat of Enshi, and in Shashi, a new 
light industrial city, have also been completed and have gone 
into use. 
  The improved investment environment has greatly enhanced 
Hubei's appeal to overseas investors. Foreign investment keeps 
pouring into the province's major cities of Wuhan, Huangshi and 
Yichang. 
  Meanwhile, statistics show that Hubei approved the 
establishment of 2,188 new foreign-funded enterprises last year, 
943 more than in the previous year.

  [Text] Wuhan, February 4 (XINHUA) -- More and more foreign 
investors are putting their money into the central China 
province of Hubei. 
  In 1993 the province approved the establishment of 2,188 new 
foreign-funded enterprises, involving an agreed use of 1.9 
billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds. The figures represent 
75.74 percent and 98.53 percent increases, respectively, 
compared with 1992. 
  According to local officials, Hubei has so far approved the 
establishment of 3,433 foreign-funded enterprises, which are 
expected to bring in a total of 3.2 billion U.S. dollars in 
foreign investment. 
  Local officials attributed the foreign investment boom in 
the 
province to the implementation of the national strategy for 
opening and speeding up the development of areas along the Chang 
Jiang river, overseas investment promotion events, the 
increasingly improved investment environment and effective 
measures made to simplify approval procedures. 
  Operational foreign-funded enterprises in the province are 
reporting good production and operation achievements, and a 
rapid growth of exports of their products. 
  The 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises in operation realized 
3.23 billion yuan from sales of their products last year, 
generating 197 million yuan in local revenue. 
  These enterprises have earned 188 million U.S. dollars from 
exports in the past year, accounting for 11.2 percent of the 
province's total export earnings, the officials said.

  [Text] The vast number of cadres and staff of the banking 
sector in our province have conscientiously implemented the 
various measures requested by the central authorities to 
straighten out financial order and have intensified macroscopic 
control of banking, thus effectively alleviating the shortage of 
funds and ensuring a sustained and wholesome economic 
development in the province. In this connection, Wang Maolin, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, wrote a few days 
ago to Cai Lulun, president of the Hunan provincial branch of 
the People's Bank of China, to express his full appreciation of 
the performance of the banking sector. 
  The banking sector of Hunan province was faced with an 
unprecedentedly difficult situation early last year, as the 
amount of deposits was decreasing drastically, loans were being 
reduced, and a lot of problems persisted, such as arbitrary 
fund-raising, interbank loan lending in violation of 
regulations, and unreasonable interest rates. The provincial 
branch of the People's Bank adopted a series of resolute and 
effective measures to further intensify macroeconomic regulation 
and control, and comprehensively straighten out financial order, 
thus promptly alleviating the shortage of credit funds. By the 
end of last year, banking institutions in the province 
registered a net increase of 12.5 billion yuan in the amount of 
deposits of general categories, a record increase in the 
province. While the amount of deposits was increasing, the 
amount of loans extended also increased, with the combination of 
loan categories optimized. By the end of last year, the balance 
of loans of all categories lent by banking institutions in the 
province totaled 95.5 billion yuan. The newly granted loans 
basically went to key financing projects. As far as the 
procurement of agricultural and sideline products is concerned, 
not only those IOU's left over from the previous year were paid 
off, but no more IOU's were issued last year. Meanwhile, the 
issue of delay in payment of postal orders which had caused much 
trouble for a while was basically solved. Last year, the 
proportion of actually granted loans to the total loan amount 
applied for to finance key projects was the highest, as compared 
with the figures in previous years. Ninety percent of the loans 
granted to the industrial sector were used to support large- and 
medium-sized enterprises. 
  While banking services were improved, financial order was 
also gradually improved in the province. In the latter half of 
last year, more than 2.6 billion yuan was recovered as return of 
loans that had been granted in violation of regulations; 
branches of the People's Bank at all levels in the province 
investigated and handled 52 cases of violation of the interest 
rate policy, and 632 cases of violation of financial discipline 
regarding account settlement. Meanwhile, branches of the 
People's Bank, other specialized banks, and insurance companies 
carried out a consolidation operation to conscientiously rectify 
companies that they had established and operated on their own.

  [Text] Lhasa, February 4 (XINHUA) -- A highway has been 
built to reach Medog, the last county in accessible by road in 
the Nyingchi region of the Tibet Autonomous Region. 
  The 141-km highway took about ten years and ten million yuan 
(1.15 U.S. dollars) [figure as received] to build because of the 
difficult terrain and conditions. It starts from Zhamu and ends 
at Medog. 
  A spokesman for the provincial communications department 
said 
that frequent collapses of snow and mountains as well as 
landslides caused the road-builders "unimaginable difficulties 
and sacrifices."

  [Excerpts] Yesterday afternoon, the provincial government 
held a meeting for people in charge of commissions, offices, 
departments, and bureaus. Governor He Zhiqiang relayed the 
instructions of the provincial government's seventh executive 
meeting and arranged work for the first quarter of this year. 
  He Zhiqiang said: On the morning of 31 January, the 
provincial government held the seventh executive meeting to 
discuss work for the first quarter of this year. The basic 
principle for the work in 1994, under the guidance of Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, is to 
comprehensively implement the instructions of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, speed up the establishment of the socialist 
market economic structure, maintain sustained, speedy, and 
healthy development of the national economy, preserve political 
stability, and promote overall social progress. According to 
this basic principle, in the first quarter of this year, we 
should focus on eight tasks. 
  First, we should seriously sum up our work in 1993, fully 
confirm our achievements, find out shortcomings, and proceed 
with our work in 1994 enthusiastically with a scientific 
attitude. 
  Second, we should continue to combat corruption in 
government 
institutions. Yunnan has made certain achievements in combating 
corruption. [passage omitted] 
  Third, we should serious resolve new situations and new 
problems since the introduction of reform measures. The 
provincial government has formed 14 special groups on housing 
and price system reform, the salary of retired personnel, and 
other issues, to discuss the relevant problems and resolve them 
as soon as possible. 
  Fourth, we should do a good job in the construction of 
irrigation projects and in late autumn crop management to reap a 
good harvest. 
  Fifth, we should ensure market supplies and maintain price 
stability. 
  Sixth, we should pay close attention to arranging the lives 
and production of the people in disaster-stricken areas. 
  Seventh, we should make a success of industrial production 
and communications development, bring about a comprehensive 
balance in funding, power supply, and transportation, and ensure 
power supplies for the people during the Spring Festival. 
  Eighth, to usher in the upcoming second session of the 
eighth 
provincial people's congress and the second session of the 
seventh provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, we should make all necessary 
arrangements. 
  Zhang Baoshan, member of the provincial party committee's 
Standing Committee, as well as Vice Governors Niu Shaoyao and 
Wang Bingsheng attended the meeting.

  [Text] Tianjin, February 4 (XINHUA) -- North China's 
industrial city of Tianjin plans to complete the technical 
upgrading of all its state-owned industrial enterprises in eight 
years by using overseas funds. 
  Last year the city's industrial enterprises signed 197 
contracts on setting up foreign-funded firms, with a total 
investment of 596 million U.S. dollars -- 83 percent and 88 
percent increases, respectively, over the previous year. Of the 
total investment, 200 million U.S. dollars came from foreign 
investors. 
  Some 66 foreign-funded firms went into operation last year. 
  By the end of 1993 Tianjin had registered a total of 674 
foreign-funded industrial firms with a total investment of 2.36 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  Their registered capital came to 1.74 billion U.S. dollars, 
of which some 873 million U.S. dollars came from foreign 
investors. 
  The city now has 187 foreign-funded firms in operation. They 
have 43,000 employees. 
  In 1993 Tianjin's foreign-funded enterprises recorded an 
industrial production value of 7.33 billion yuan (about 900 
million U.S. dollars) and profits of 750 million yuan, and 
handed over taxes of one billion yuan. 
  By the end of last year 227 enterprises had started 
technical 
upgrading programs by using a total of 590 million U.S. dollars 
in overseas funds. 
  The technical upgrading programs have helped enterprises 
improve product quality, technology and management. 
  At the same time, the city has paid special attention to 
strengthening cooperation with international big-name 
corporations. 
  In the past two years Tianjin has encouraged a number of its 
major electronics, motorcycle, refrigerator, washing machine and 
detergent firms to seek cooperation with big foreign companies, 
such as Hankel of Germany, Samsung of the Republic of Korea, 
Honda of Japan and ZEC of Italy. 
  So far, the city has set up joint ventures with more than 
100 
such companies, 18 of which have an annual production value of 
over 100 million yuan each and annual profits exceeding 10 
million yuan each.

  [Excerpts] On 3-4 February, leaders of the provincial party 
committee, including Sun Weiben, Mao Guoling, Tian Fengshan, and 
Shan Rongfan, respectively traveled to colleges, universities, 
and scientific research institutes to visit some specialists in 
Harbin, and through them, extended spring festive greetings to 
intellectuals throughout the province. 
  Yesterday afternoon, Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial 
party committee, traveled to Harbin Engineering College to hold 
talks with several class masters with a doctor degree who have 
enjoyed great prestige internationally. First of all, Sun 
Weiben introduced to specialists the whole province's economic 
and social development situation of last year and the whole 
province's work arrangements of this year. 
  The specialists expressed congratulations on the province's 
achievements in increasing the economy by five percent and 
ranking the province ninth in the national economic and social 
comprehensive index last year. They said: The great 
achievements which the province had made under a situation of 
heavy burdens showed that last year's work arrangements made by 
the provincial party committee and the provincial government 
were correct and that they had done their work with utmost 
efforts. They believed that as long as they continue to act in 
line with the established principles of the provincial party 
committee and the provinical government, persist in reform and 
opening up, uphold the plan of relying on science and technology 
to develop the economy, it will not take a long time to enable 
our province to become an economically strong province. They 
also offered their own views on the economy and science. 
  Professor (Liu Yuntan), member of the China Academy of 
Sciences, said: The slogan of relying on science and technology 
to develop the economy has been chanted for many years. 
However, this issue has remained unresolved. This is caused not 
only by the unenthusiastic work style of scientific and 
technical workers and enterprises but also the structure. (Yang 
Shiqun), president of Harbin Engineering College, believed that 
this is mainly caused by concepts. Enterprises are more 
enthusiastic in making money than in using science and 
technology. Professor (Wang Menhu) said: Large and 
medium-sized enterprises are the burdens of Heilongjiang, but 
they are also the endowed advantages. It is very difficult to 
solve these burdens, however, if we realisticlly rely on science 
and technology to transform the traditional industries into high 
technology industries, Heilongjiang will surely become an 
economic giant. [passage omitted] 
  The specialists also suggested that the provincial 
authorities should issue some preferential policies as quickly 
as possible, build a trans-city and trans-regional contingent of 
trained personnel, and enable top-notch personnel of about 35 
years old to settle down at ease in Heilongjiang. 
  Secretary Sun Weiben thanked the specialists for offering 
suggestions. He said: These suggestions will be very helpful 
to our province's future work. We should properly analyze the 
reasons behind the issues on transforming achievements and on 
trained personnel, and solve them one by one in an effort to 
enable the economy of Heilongjiang to realistically leap forward 
under the stimulation of our strong science and technology.

  [Text] Shenyang, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Liaoning Province, 
a major heavy industry centre where state-owned firms 
predominated, has witnessed a rapid development in its private 
economy. 
  By the end of last year the province had over 740,000 
privately owned firms, with a total of 1.303 million employees 
-- respectively 17.9 percent and 22.4 percent up over the 
previous year. 
  The figure means that on average there were over 8,000 
self-employed people and over 400 private firms emerging each 
month in the province last year. 
  For a long time in the past the private economy had made 
slow 
progress in Liaoning. 
  But with rapid social development in recent years, this 
northeast China province has given priority to boosting the 
private economy. 
  The average registered capital of each self-employed person 
was over 6,300 yuan last year, 30 percent more than in the 
previous year. 
  Increasing numbers of technological and export-oriented 
private firms have been founded in the province. 
  In 1993 Liaoning had more than 2,600 self-employed and 
private technological firms, and over 160 foreign-funded firms. 
  The private businesses have started to carry out joint-stock 
and leasing systems. Some have set up co-operation ties with 
collective or state enterprises not only locally but also in 
other areas of the country. 
  Last year private businesses recorded a total production 
value of 11.8 billion yuan, 83.8 percent up over 1992, and 
handed over 1.5 billion yuan in taxes, six percent of the total 
tax revenue of the province. 
  The development of the private economy has boosted local 
markets. 
  It has also helped employ large numbers of surplus rural 
labor. 
  The province has a nearly 20 million rural population, with 
average per capita cultivated land of about 0.08 ha, lower than 
the average level of the country. 
  Now household businesses of farm product processing, 
fisheries, garment and shoe making, and knitwear have mushroomed 
in rural areas of Liaoning.

  [Text] Shenyang, February 4 (XINHUA) -- During the past two 
years, 100 small enterprises included in a "small giants" 
project launched by northeast China's Liaoning Province have 
seen an increase of over 45 percent in their annual output value. 
  These businesses were selected from the province's state-run 
companies, township enterprises and joint ventures at the 
beginning of 1992, each with an output value of above 50 million 
yuan and profits and tax turnover of more 5 million yuan. 
  Cao Guixing, director of the provincial economic committee, 
attributed the rapid growth to their good operation, high 
efficiency and market-oriented products. 
  Their average output value is expected to be more than 100 
million yuan within several years. 
  For example, the output value of Shenyang Feilong Health 
Goods Ltd has jumped from some 100 million yuan in 1992 to 870 
million yuan last year. 
  Cao said some businesses, which lagged behind in tough 
competition, will be removed from the "small giants" list. 
  He also said that if there are more and more businesses 
which 
qualify, the number can surpass 100. 
  Liaoning is one of China's important heavy industrial bases, 
which embraces 1,261 medium and large-sized enterprises, 
accounting for one-tenth of China's total.

  [Excerpts] During an inspection of Yongchang County, 
Acting Governor Zhang Wule said: Peasants in western Gansu 
should speed up their move toward moderate prosperity to set a 
good example for the rest of the province to follow. We should 
encourage peasants to boldly enter the market economy, to 
simultaneously develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, 
sideline production, and fisheries, and to comprehensively 
develop primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. We should 
put increasing peasant income in the first place. 
  Two days ago, Acting Governor Zhang Wule visited some 
peasant 
households in Shuiyuan Township, Yongchang County, and asked 
them about their lives in the period leading to the Spring 
Festival. On behalf of the provincial party committee and 
government, he expressed his Lunar New Year greetings to the 
peasants. In home of a peasant named Wang Jiaoying, Zhang Wule 
asked him about his income from grain sales last year, his 
purchase of agricultural production materials, and the 
township's service for agricultural production, supply, and 
marketing. [passage omitted] 
  When a village party branch secretary told Zhang Wule that 
the village people ensured grain acreage in the course of 
planting fruit, Zhang Wule expressed agreement with this and 
stressed: Gansu is a grain-deficient province, where 6 million 
people are short of grain, so developing grain production is 
Gansu's basic principle. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] A provincial meeting of public security 
departmental and bureau chiefs closed in Xian a few days ago. 
Ai Pishan, chief of the provincial public security department 
attended and addressed the meeting. He stressed: As the Spring 
Festival is approaching, public security institutions at all 
levels should devote much attention to cracking criminal 
offenses and improving social order to ensure that the people 
will spend the Spring Festival peacefully and harmoniously. 
  He pointed out: Last year Shaanxi made gratifying 
achievements in cracking down on crime. But serious crimes will 
still remain prominent for a period of time to come. Public 
security institutions at all levels in the province should 
continue to persist in the policy of severely cracking down and 
striking relentless blows at all criminal offenses. Particular 
attention should be paid to cities and towns where major crimes 
frequently occur, and to factories, mines, and economic 
development zones along railways and highways where the 
situation in social order is complicated. Great importance 
should be attached to severe crackdowns on crime in Xian and 
Baoji. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hong Kong, Feb. 4 KYODO -- China on Friday [4 
February] gave a cautious welcome to Hong Kong's latest funding 
proposal for the new multibillion dollar airport at Chek Lap Kok. 
  The Hong Kong Government has sent China a new airport 
financing package, offering to pump about 7.76 billion U.S. 
dollars into the project and reduce the overall debt burden. 
  A Hong Kong-based spokesman for the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG) told KYODO news service by telephone that 
the latest offer is "a distinct improvement" on three previous 
ones which all sought a greater level of debt. 
  "We still need time to study the proposals fully but it's 
fair to say that we are more optimistic than before that an 
agreement can be reached," the spokesman said. 
  "I can't tell you exactly when we will respond to the 
proposals, especially with the Chinese New Year holiday coming 
up, but it should not be too long." The holiday is February 9 
and 10. 
  The spokesman declined to speculate when China might be 
prepared to attend a JLG airport committee meeting to hammer out 
a final funding agreement, but said the new proposals have 
"improved the prospects" for such a meeting. 
  Under the latest plan, the Hong Kong Government would dip 
into its huge fiscal reserves to help pay for airport projects 
and reduce the amount of debt payable after China resumes 
sovereignty over the territory in July 1997.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, Feb 4 (AFP)--China has released three 
dissidents who were jailed after the 1989 pro-democracy 
movement, a U.S. human rights activist said Friday. 
  John Kamm, a U.S. businessman and human-rights campaigner, 
said he was told by the Chinese government that the three had 
been released. The three are Xiao Bin, a worker from Liaoning, 
Liao Yiwu, a leading poet from Sichuan province, and Ding Junze 
(eds correct), former assistant professor of philosophy at 
Shanxi University, Kamm said in a statement received here. 
  The justice ministry, questioned Friday, said it had "no 
news" about any such release. 
  Xiao was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on June 10, 
1989 
on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement. 
He was arrested after giving numerous interviews to foreign 
correspondents, including an interview broadcast by ABC News in 
which he reported having witnessed many students killed in the 
military crackdown on June 4. Xiao, whose 10-year sentence was 
reduced by six months in December 1991, was paroled for good 
behaviour on Wednesday. 
  Liao had been sentenced to four years in jail in March 1990 
for counter-revolutionary incitement. He was released on Monday 
[31 January], two months ahead of scheduled, for good behaviour, 
by a court in Sichuan. Ding, jailed for 10 years in June 1989, 
was also released on January 31 on medical grounds. Aged 52, he 
has been suffering from spine problems and a heart condition, 
Kamm said. 
  Kamm, who is based in Hong Kong, had predicted on January 22 
that three dissidents would be released before the Lunar New 
Year, on Febuary 10. Kamm said he had made enquiries about 
other dissidents arrested after the bloody crackdown in 
Tiananmen Square, including Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao, who are 
serving 13-year terms, but he did not get a definite reply.

  [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing said today that customs offices must meet the needs of a 
socialist market economy and help maintain "sustained, rapid and 
healthy" growth of China's economy. 
  Addressing a national conference on customs work which 
closed 
here today, Li said that the customs restructuring must be 
carried out simultaneously with the overall reform of China's 
economic structure. 
  It is necessary to institute a modern customs system with 
Chinese characteristics that will meet the needs of a socialist 
market economic structure and opening up, and will be compatible 
with internationally accepted practices, the leader told 
directors of customs offices from all over the country. 
  To this end, "We must introduce an inspection system, reform 
the declaration system and the customs managerial system..., 
while combining our professional restructuring with the use of 
modern technical means in an effort to establish modern, 
efficient customs offices," he said. 
  Li Lanqing urged the directors of customs offices to tighten 
supervision of import and export goods and crack down on all 
kinds of duty evasion and fraud so as to maintain a normal 
economic order. 
  "We have scored initial successes in the current 
anti-smuggling campaign, but by no means can we relax our 
efforts," he said. 
  The leader pledged to investigate and handle major smuggling 
cases promptly, noting that it is imperative to combine the 
anti-smuggling campaign with the anti-corruption campaign in 
order to ensure the healthy development of the country's 
economic construction.

  [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Wu Yi, China's 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said here 
today that the country's foreign trade companies should be more 
aware of competition, so as to push forward the development of 
China's foreign trade. 
  She was speaking at a meeting of the China National 
Technical 
Import and Export Corporation. 
  She noted that China's foreign trade companies face 
increasingly severe competition with the establishment of the 
market system and China's foreign trade reforms. 
  China already has over 7,000 enterprises enjoying foreign 
trade rights, including nearly 2,000 industrial enterprises, 
over 280 barter trade corporations, and over 120 scientific 
institutions. 
  She said that this year's foreign trade target is set to 
reach 200 billion U.S. dollars, which will be a painstaking 
task. But, she noted, reforms of China's foreign exchange and 
foreign trade systems will provide new opportunities. 
  She hoped that all foreign trade companies will strive for a 
new breakthrough by keeping their eyes both on the domestic and 
overseas market, paying due attention to quality control and 
diversifying foreign trade markets. 
  She said that China will expand its technical imports and 
exports this year, with the focus on technical imports for key 
national and long-term projects such as power stations and 
telephone systems. 
  At the same time, China will enhance its export of 
equipment, 
high-tech products and high value-added products of machinery 
and electronics. 
  She also said that foreign trade companies should try to 
strengthen their overseas business management, which is a key 
point for this year's foreign trade.

SEF for keeping a channel open for contact and discussions with 
ARATS. Wang Zhaoguo said: Since its inception, ARATS has had 
many contacts and discussions with SEF, and helped advance 
contacts and discussions on routine affairs across the strait. 
Wang Daohan and Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] had a successful meeting 
in Singapore last April, which General Secretary Jiang Zemin 
termed a successful and fruitful meeting that marked an 
important, historic step in the development of relations across 
the strait. After the Wang-Ku talks, the two organizations had 
several working discussions. This visit by Vice Chairman Jiao 
to Beijing for high-level talks is of great significance. He 
said: Regular contacts and discussions will help the two sides 
enhance mutual understanding and reach a consensus. 
  Jiao Renhe said: The SEF and ARATS have already had many 
discussions. This is my first visit to Beijing; in the past 
three days I have had two meetings with Tang Shubei and Zou 
Zhekai. The two sides have made considerable progress toward 
reaching a consensus; one thing still lacking is "convergence" 
and more efforts are needed. Jiao Renhe also said: Promoting 
cross-strait exchanges involves a host of miscellaneous 
problems. A key point is to build "mutual confidence." It is 
hoped that things will develop in ways conducive to cross-strait 
exchange and cooperation. 
  Wang Zhaoguo said: The current visit by Jiao has helped 
advance the development of cross-strait relations. After 
discussions, the two organizations have reached an understanding 
on the following four points: First, high-level officials of 
the two organizations reaffirmed the understanding on 
repatriation, in principle, of all hijackers; second, the two 
organization agreed that they should follow the principle of 
stressing the nongovernmental and routine nature of their 
discussions, eschew politically sensitive issues, and refrain 
from imposing their political demands on each other; third, it 
is essential and important to keep open a clear channel of 
contact and discussions between the two organizations; fourth, 
both sides wish to see that a second Wang-Gu meeting be held at 
an early date. 
  After the meeting, Tang Shubei briefed reporters on the 
meeting. He said: The meeting proceeded in a sincere, cordial, 
and harmonious [cheng zhi qin qie rong qia 6134 2304 6024 0434 
5816 3174] atmosphere. Wang Zhaoguo also briefed the guests the 
on progress the mainland has made in implementing the policy of 
reform and opening up over the past 15 years, and its ongoing 
efforts to develop a socialist market economy. Jiao Renhe 
briefed the hosts on the political situation in Taiwan. 
  After the meeting, Wang Zhaoguo entertained Jiao Renhe and 
SEF Deputy Secretaries General Shi Qiping [Shi Chi-ping] and Xu 
Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu]. 
  Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of the ARATS, and Zou 
Zhekai, vice-president and secretary general of ARATS, were also 
in attendance.

  [Excerpt] A Spring Festival gathering was held in 
Shijiazhuang on the afternoon of 3 February for party, 
government, and army leaders to discuss the fish-and-water 
relations between the army and the people and to celebrate the 
new year for reform and opening up. On behalf of the provincial 
party committee, people's congress standing committee, 
government, and Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference committee, and the people throughout the province, 
Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
extended cordial festive greetings to all the commanders and 
soldiers of the army units stationed in our province and the 
people's armed police force who had made great contributions to 
maintaining social stability, developing the economy, and 
consolidating national defense. 
  After introducing Hebei's economic and political situation, 
Cheng Weigao said: In the past year, the province saw 
continuously deepened reform, expanded opening up, developed 
economy, political stability and unity, and social development 
and progress. This was a result of the concerted efforts of the 
people across the province, but it could not be separated from 
the active participation and great support of the vast number of 
officers and men stationed in the province. 
  Cheng Weigao pointed out: The endeavor of seizing the 
opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, 
promote development, and maintain stability, requires the strong 
unity and cooperation between the army and the government and 
between the army and the people as well as the continued warm 
concern and great support of the people's army. From the 
perspective of defending social and political stability and 
promoting comprehensive social progress, party committee and 
governments at all levels and the people across the province 
should put the efforts to support army building and maintain 
close army- government and army-civilian relations in an 
important position to meet the general demand of sharing the 
common fate and linking the hearts of the people to each other. 
They should defend our great wall of steel and enhance the 
army's prestige as they cherish their eyes and achieve still 
better results in the double-support work in the new situation.

  [Text] Hanoi, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Hanoi today welcomed 
Washington's decision to lift the U.S. trade embargo against 
Vietnam, saying it was "a positive and significant decision, 
which contributes to opening a new page in U.S.-Vietnamese 
relations in the interest of the two peoples." 
  At a press conference held here this afternoon, Vietnamese 
Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai issued [a] statement by his 
ministry saying the decision meets the approval of the American 
and Vietnamese people, and that of many other countries as well. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday [3 February] 
declared 
the embargo on Vietnam at an end, and proposed the mutual 
establishment of liaison offices in the two countries. 
  Le Mai said that improvement in U.S.-Vietnamese relations 
would make a significant contribution to peace, friendship, and 
cooperation among nations. 
  The Vietnamese Government reaffirms its policy of attaching 
importance to relations with the United States and expresses the 
wish for normal relations between the two countries, he 
continued. 
  Officials of the two countries will meet immediately to 
discuss the details of setting up liaison offices. Vietnam sees 
this development as a transitional step towards full diplomatic 
relations between the two countries, he added. 
  Le Mai also reiterated Vietnam's policy of regarding the 
question of Americans missing in action in the war as a 
humanitarian concern, and not linked to political issues. 
  In consonance with their humane tradition and policy, the 
Government and people of Vietnam have been, and will be 
cooperating in a constructive spirit with the American 
Government and people to solve this issue to the fullest 
possible extent, he stressed. 
  The vice minister said that Vietnam is willing to become a 
friend of the international community and will work for the sake 
of peace, stability and development in Southeast Asia and the 
world. 
  Le Mai said it will be a long and difficult process between 
lifting the embargo and normalizing relations, and it is up to 
the extent of sincerity shown by both sides to decide whether 
there will be obstacles in this process. 
  He expressed the wish that the United States will look upon 
Vietnam as a friend, just as Vietnam looks at the United States 
as its friend. 
  John Cray, head of the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi, today also 
told reporters that the lifting of embargo will help strengthen 
cooperation between the two countries in solving the MIA issue.

<F P=106> ["Backgrounder": "U.S.-Vietnam Trade: How it Starts and </F>
Where It'll Go" by Wang Nan] 
  [Text] Washington, February 4 (XINHUA) -- For Washington, 
which lifted its 1975 trade embargo against Vietnam on Thursday 
[3 February], the South East Asian nation is an emerging market 
worth billions of dollars in business. 
  In a few weeks, U.S. federal agencies including the Commerce 
Department will complete the drafting of U.S. trade and 
investment regulations in Vietnam. Related tax codes are 
expected to come out too. 
  Among the existing U.S. laws banning U.S. trade with Vietnam 
are the 1993 Foreign Aid Appropriations Bill and amendment laws 
to the U.S. Export-Import Bank. 
  Officials from Treasury and State Departments will head for 
Vietnam for talks on U.S. Government and private property claims 
stemming from the war, estimated at between 140 and 200 million 
U.S. dollars. 
  Washington said its share of Vietnamese market will worth 
six 
billion U.S. dollars a year. Before 1996, trade in aviation, 
telecommunications, heavy equipment and construction will be 
four billion dollars. 
  According to the 110-member U.S.-ASEAN council, the lifting 
of embargo will generate more than eight billion dollars in new 
export opportunities for U.S. firms in five years. 
  Since 1975, the embargo has costed U.S. firms 1.5 billion 
dollars in annual sales, according to the papers released by the 
council on competitiveness. 
  Observers here said U.S. investment chances in Vietnam are 
mainly in power generation, medical equipment, transportation 
equipment, construction, engineering, telephones and commercial 
aircraft. 
  Vietnam also represents a vast market for U.S. information 
technology, banking services, oil and gas exploration 
technologies, accounting and legal services. 
  On the other hand, the lifting of trade embargo will boost 
Vietnam's exports of garments, textiles, shoes, toys and others 
to the U.S.. 
  The JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, a major trade newspaper, reported 
today that as many as 300 U.S. companies stand ready to trade 
with Vietnam, like Boeing, Digital Equipment and Motorola. 
  Already, three dozen U.S. firms have set up representative 
offices in Hanoi since U.S. dropped its opposition to loans to 
Vietnam by international financial institutions last July. 
  Among the U.S. companies catching up quickly in trade with 
Vietnam are Pepsi-Cola International, Coca Cola, Eastman Kodak 
Co., General Electric Co., Mobil Corp. and Citibank. 
  American Express will sign an agreement with Vietnam's Bank 
of Foreign Trade that permits the use of its credit cards in 
Vietnam. United Airlines is seeking permission to start flights 
between Los Angeles and Ho Chi Minh City.

  [Text] Moscow, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin may soon appoint three scholars, who are known for 
their "independent outlook" as his aides, presidential sources 
said on Friday [4 February]. 
  The three "stars," Georgiy Satarov, Emil Paine and Leonid 
Smirnyagin, are all members of the Presidential Council at 
present. But they have always expressed their "independent 
opinions" that cause "discontent" of the president, the sources 
said. 
  Satarov is expected to be named presidential aide for 
working 
with the Parliament. Paine is an expert on nationalities 
problems, and Smirnyagin on regional policy. 
  Satarov reportedly aims to create "the necessary political 
atmosphere in which the relations of the president and the 
Parliament are based on a two-way flow of information." 
  Paine and Smirnyagin will enrich the presidential 
administration with their scientific and research potential. 
  The three, if appointed, would join another "independent" 
expert, Yuriy Baturin, who recently became the presidential 
national security adviser. 
  Baturin came to work for the president from the foundation 
created by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and was 
the only member of the presidential support group to express 
disagreement with Yeltsin's decree dissolving the former 
Parliament last October. 
  According to the sources, Yeltsin is planning to consult 
Baturin, Satarov, Paine and Smirnyagin during preparations of 
his state of the nation address which he is to make to the 
two-chamber Parliament.

  [Text] Moscow, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin today suspended a government decision to construct 
a new parliamentary building which was to cost 500 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  The former parliament "White House" was allocated for 
government use following the bloody October event last year. 
  Yeltsin's order was announced by the presidential press 
service department in the wake of much criticism of the 
construction plan which was also one of the reasons why Yegor 
Gaydar, one of the government's senior officials, resigned on 
January 16.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 6 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today rejected the charge that 
it was causing the tense situation on the Korean peninsula with 
its missiles. 
  In a commentary today, the official newspaper NODONG SINMUN 
said that "there exists absolutely no DPRK missile threat." 
  The commentary added that the defense capacity of the DPRK, 
a 
peace-loving country, was set for self-defense only. 
  It said the U.S. allegation of a DPRK missile threat was a 
"plot" designed to justify its plans to deploy "Patriot" 
missiles in South Korea and set up a "theater missile defense 
system" with Japan. 
  The commentary said the United States, which had increased 
its military presence in South Korea and other areas, had 
created obstacles to the effort to solve the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  It pointed out that the "DPRK missile threat" resulted from 
the U.S. desire to maintain and expand its military status in 
Northeast Asia. 
  It stressed that if the United States continued to put 
pressure on the DPRK by using its military might, the situation 
on the Korean peninsula would be intensified and the possibility 
of war heightened.

  His ministry is preparing to organize a Malaysian culture 
and 
food festival in Beijing next month as a promotion program, he 
added.

  [Text] Dhaka, February 7 (XINHUA) -- China and Bangladesh 
signed a contract on the Barapukuria Coal-Mine Development 
Project on Monday [7 February], which will be the first such 
project ever built in this South Asian country. 
  Mei Haolin, deputy general manager of the China National 
Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC), and M. A. Jalil 
Khan, secretary of the Petrobangla signed the contract on behalf 
of their respective sides. 
  Present at the occasion were Chinese Ambassador to 
Bangladesh 
Zhang Xujiang and Bangladesh Minister of Power, Energy and 
Mineral Resources Khondaker Mosharraf Hossain [title as 
received]. 
  According to a Chinese official, the project is jointly 
contracted by CMC and other two Chinese companies, with an 
investment of more than 200 million U.S. dollars. The Chinese 
Government will provide a buyer's credit of almost 200 million 
U.S. dollars to the project. 
  It will be the largest overseas turn-key project ever 
contracted by the Chinese companies, the official noted. 
  The project, with an annual capacity of 1 million tons of 
coal, is scheduled to be completed in five years and aims to 
ease the bottle-necked energy supply in Bangladesh.

  [Text] Tehran, February 6 (XINHUA) -- Iranian leader 
Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i today blamed the "satanic powers" for 
Tuesday's [1 February] aborted assassination of President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  He warned against plots of "satanic powers" to physically 
eliminate those Iranian people who are efficient and helpful for 
the country, Islam and Moslems. 
  It is understood that the "satanic powers" refer to the 
United States and Israel. 
  Iranian authorities said that President Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
was the target of the unsuccessful assassination attempt on 
February 1. 
  Shots were fired into the air at the shrine of Ayatollah 
Khomeini as Rafsanjani was delivering a speech at a ceremony 
there to mark the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic 
revolution. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i termed the Islamic revolution as a great 
storm which thwarted treacherous conspiracies and ambitious 
plans of the United States and its lackeys in Iran when he was 
addressing a large group of people today. 
  At the same time, the local daily "TEHRAN TIMES," which 
usually expresses the views of the Foreign Ministry, today and 
Saturday also blamed the United States and Israel for the 
assassination attempt. 
  The daily said in its editorial that the United States and 
Israel are the two countries which consider Iran and its Islamic 
revolution detrimental to their interests. 
  The editorial added that both Israel and its master, the 
United States, have a long history of assassinating world 
leaders.

Senate add a new page to the history of China-Pakistan 
friendship, Jiang said. 
  Sajjad said that Sino-Pakistan friendship is sincere and has 
stood the test of time. "We cherish our friendship with China," 
he said.

  [Text] Beijing, February 5 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said here today that the setback in 
Sino-Burkina Faso relations is not what the Chinese side wishes 
to see, and the responsibility for it rests entirely with the 
Government of Burkina Faso. 
  On February 2, the Government of Burkina Faso, in disregard 
of the long-standing friendly relations and cooperation between 
China and Burkina Faso, announced the so-called "restoration" of 
"diplomatic relations" with Taiwan, the spokesman said, adding 
that the Chinese Government has lodged a strong protest with the 
Government of Burkina Faso and announced the suspension of 
diplomatic relations with Burkina Faso and cessation of 
implementation of all agreements between the two governments. 
  In recent years, the spokesman pointed out, the Taiwan 
authorities, taking advantage of the temporary economic 
difficulties of some countries, have gone out of their way to 
pursue "money diplomacy" in an attempt to create "two Chinas" or 
"one China, one Taiwan". 
  This indecent trick, he noted, goes entirely against the 
fundamental interest of the Chinese nation and is bound to meet 
the opposition of the people on both sides of the Taiwan straits. 
  "The scheme of the Taiwan authorities is doomed to failure," 
he said.

<F P=106> ["What the Chinese People Say" column by Fu Xu (0265 2485): </F>
"Looking Into the Future With Full Confidence"] 
  [Text] In 1993 important progress was made in cross-strait 
relations, and Macao entered its later period of transition. On 
the Hong Kong issue, however, Sino-British talks were terminated 
unilaterally by the British side, which deliberately raised 
obstacles, although both sides had carried out 17 rounds of 
talks for more than seven months. This is an unfavorable factor 
to Hong Kong's steady transition, but not a decisive factor. 
Hong Kong's economic situation is good. Some 12 percent of 
Hong Kong people who have settled down abroad over the past 10 
years or so have returned. Many Hong Kong citizens say that they 
have full confidence in Hong Kong's future. 
  The breakdown of talks is something we do not wish to see. 
This has been proved by the unremitting efforts the Chinese 
side has made from the beginning to the end of the talks. 
However, what has now happened is also not unexpected. As 
early as 1982 when meeting with former British Prime Minister 
Mrs. Thatcher, Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave the following 
prediction: "What I am concerned about is how to ensure a 
smooth transition in the next 15 years. I am afraid that great 
disorders may appear during this period. But they will all be 
manmade disorders, disorders made not only by foreigners, but 
also Chinese, but mainly the British." The old-line British 
colonialists have occupied the territory of Hong Kong, their 
last colony, for more than 100 years. They will certainly be 
unhappy about quiting immediately, although they also often 
spout high-sounding words of democracy. The current problem is 
how we should look at the situation we are facing. 
  Some Hong Kong citizens with foresight said: "We must rely 
on our own efforts to ensure a smooth transition in Hong Kong." 
  In the past, because of the weak and corrupted royal court 
of 
the Qing Dynasty and the force of the British imperialists, 
three unequal treaties were signed. As a result, Britain has 
occupied this Chinese territory for more than 100 years. 
  On 19 December 1984, the heads of the Chinese and British 
Governments signed in Beijing a joint declaration on the Hong 
Kong issue after two years of talks. On 27 May 1985, the two 
governments put the Sino-British Joint Declaration into effect 
by exchanging instruments of ratification in Beijing. The 
long-cherished wishes of the Chinese people finally came true. 
This could never have been done either by the Qing Court or in 
old China. The dream of the Chinese people can be turned into 
reality only today, when China has become powerful. In his 
speech delivered at the Third Plenary Meeting of the Central 
Advisory Commission, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Why could 
talks on the Hong Kong issue be held successfully? It was not 
because the participants on our side had special skills. The 
main reason was that our country had developed in the past few 
years and become a prosperous country, a powerful country, and a 
trustworthy country. We keep our word and mean what we say." 
Hong Kong's prosperity and return and Macao's return have all 
benefited from this, and so will the reunification of the 
motherland in the future. This is where our confidence lies. 
  Under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line and with the intensification of reform and expansion of the 
opening up drive, our country will become more powerful. The 
party and state are fully confident on this point. By adhering 
to the policy of "one country, two systems," further 
intensifying reform, and opening wider to the outside world, the 
Basic Law will go deeper into the hearts of the people....Our 
future is certainly bright. 
  The new year is approaching. Let us look at the brighter 
future with full confidence!

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Boat People and Embargoes"] </F>
  [Text] Better late than never. President Clinton's 
lifting of the three-decade-old American trade embargo against 
Vietnam was long overdue, but nonetheless welcome. 
  While the embargo may have served its original purpose of 
encouraging the Vietnamese to account for the more than 2,000 
American servicemen still listed as Missing in Action, it has 
ceased to have any real function other than to block US 
companies from competing in one of Asia's fastest growing 
markets. Indeed the move may have come too late for some 
American businesses. As former Vietnamese Foreign Minister 
Nguyen Co Thach said at an end of embargo party in Hanoi: "In 
Vietnam, we have a saying. The latecomer buffalo will drink 
polluted water". 
  It was nonetheless a brave political act for a President 
still plagued by accusations of draft-dodging during the Vietnam 
war, and whose Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, has only just been 
cleared of accepting bribes for working to have the embargo 
ended. 
  The criticism levelled at Mr Clinton by Vietnam war veterans 
suggests he may still pay a political price for his decision. 
It would be a price worth paying. 
  For the lifting of the embargo is good news, not only for 
Vietnam and the US, but also for Hong Kong and the rest of Asia. 
In the short-term, local companies will have to work harder in 
a market where they have built up a dominant position. The 
territory has already pumped HK$1.2 billion [Hong Kong dollars] 
into projects there, an amount second only to Taiwan. 
  But, in the longer term, the lifting of the embargo will 
strengthen Hong Kong's chances of remaining a regional hub 
beyond 1997, with the territory -- already well-served by direct 
flights to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City -- well-positioned to 
serve as a staging post for American businesses as they flood 
back into Vietnam. 
  More important still, the decision should finally close the 
chapter on the Vietnam war and its legacy of boat people who are 
still attempting the journey to the territory. As the thousands 
of boat people who are languishing in detention centres know, it 
is a journey to nowhere. 
  Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey and Refugee 
Coordinator Brian Bresnihan leave this week for an international 
conference in Geneva to look at ways of speeding up the return 
of boat people, the majority of whom have been screened out as 
economic migrants by Hong Kong. 
  It has always been recognised that the long-term solution to 
the boat people problem lies in Vietnam itself. Mandatory 
repatriation may have halted the influx over the past couple of 
years. But the only real guarantee for the Vietnamese lies in 
bringing the country back into the international fold. Vietnam 
needs to rebuild its economy and give its people every reason to 
stay and become a vital part of the process. 
  The lifting of the embargo can give an important boost to 
that process. It is not the end of the road, for that will only 
come when the US resumes diplomatic relations with Hanoi, 
something which is still some way away. But it is certainly a 
significant step in the right direction.

<F P=106> [By Ruth Mathewson] </F>
  [Text] A Contingency plan to protect Hong Kong people in 
the event of an accident at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station 
is still incomplete -- despite today's official opening of the 
plant by Chinese premier Li Peng. The 1,800-megawatt facility, 
which will sell 70 per cent of its power to Hong Kong, is just 
20 kilometres from the Sai Kung peninsula and 50 km from 
Central. But senior police officers admitted last week that 
problems still had to be ironed out and agreements reached with 
mainland officials. They would keep their "fingers crossed" 
until plans were finalised, they said. 
  Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey, whose department is 
co-ordinating the contingency plans, is expected at the opening 
of China's second and largest nuclear plant. However, a 
Security Branch spokesman said negotiators were still trying to 
secure a pledge from China to notify the territory of any 
on-site accidents. The two sides would talk again in Guangdong 
later this month. 
  Meanwhile, Marine North Division commander Herbert Au 
Hok-lam, a key adviser on the police contingency plan, said 
evacuation and safety proposals for Hong Kong were "never meant 
to be an all-embracing plan". "Let's face it, it's still in the 
planning stage. Not every problem has been ironed out. We're 
still trying to work out what the problems are. We're not 
professing that the plan is perfect, (but) attacking it for lack 
of coverage or adequacy, or inadequacy, is not constructive," he 
said. 
  The Royal Hong Kong Police's Chief Staff Officer 
(Administration), Peter Cummings, said there was a basic plan of 
action in case of emergency, but it contained "a lot of 
alternative possibilities" and some details had yet to be 
determined. "By and large we do have everything planned -- we 
just have to keep our fingers crossed that nothing happens," Mr 
Cummings said. 
  Police planners, led by Marine North Division, were 
concentrating on Mirs Bay and Ping Chau island, 12 km from Daya 
Bay, he explained. The small island in Hong Kong's remote 
northeast attracts thousands of teenage campers and picnickers 
at summer weekends. "If there was a disaster at Daya Bay, it 
would be the Mirs Bay and Ping Chau areas that would be 
affected," Mr Cummings said. "If it's a weekday, there's hardly 
anybody on Ping Chau. If it's a weekend, then we've got bigger 
problems because there could be a couple of thousand people 
there. 
  "There is a provisional plan. We've got enough in hand now 
to do something if we had to, but there are always going to be 
differences of opinion: do you evacuate people, do you shelter 
people, do you need (iodine) pills or not need pills? Nothing's 
ever going to be 100 per cent satisfactory." 
  Mr Au said he had travelled to Ping Chau after the SUNDAY 
MORNING POST revealed the island's marine police had been issued 
iodine pills. Ping Chau police said they had received bottles 
of potassium iodine pills to distribute in case of a Daya Bay 
accident. Unsure of what to do with the pills, the policemen 
had padlocked them in the station's gun cupboard under 
instructions from the Police Public Relations Bureau to shield 
them from view. "They were never meant to be kept in a 
secretive manner," Mr Au said. "They have to be administered as 
soon as possible ... they are meant to be kept in first aid 
boxes. I double checked that the iodine tablets were in the 
first aid box, not in the arms cupboard." The tablets fight the 
absorption of radioactive iodine after a nuclear accident and 
have been distributed to police at Tap Mun, Kat O, Ping Chau and 
Marine North Division. 
  Ping Chau police, faced with the prospect of rounding up 
thousands of teenage picnickers with loud hailers, said they had 
expected a test run. But Mr Au said Ping Chau visitors would 
not be forewarned by government notices or police, and no test 
run had been planned. "You have to look at it from a pragmatic 
point of view -- you're looking at something that may not 
happen," Mr Au said. "I'm not in the process of arranging any 
test runs of administering the pills. (In an emergency) we would 
have to round up (picnickers) and warn them that something's 
happened. 
  "We would face the problem of evacuating them, arranging for 
transport, ensure they are kept in an orderly manner and ensure 
they can be taken to a place where they can be examined and, if 
they have been subjected to radiation, treated accordingly." 
  Daya Bay campaigner, the Reverend Fung Chi-wood yesterday 
called for the reactor to be shut down, saying the contingency 
plans failed to provide adequate protection. The United 
Democrats member and spokesman for the Joint Conference for the 
Sheltering of the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant said the group was now 
urgently pressing for the closure. "The nuclear plant poses so 
much of a threat to Hong Kong that it should cease operating," 
he said. The Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company has 
invited hundreds of government, business and media figures to 
watch Mr Li open the $31 million Daya Bay plant this morning.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Feb 7 (AFP)--China has decided to build 
another nuclear power station a few kilometers (miles) from the 
one it inaugurated Sunday in Daya Bay, near Hong Kong, the head 
of France's national power company said Monday [7 February]. 
"What we have determined from this trip (to China) is that the 
site for the plant is known. The Chinese government has clearly 
made its choice known," Electricite de France (EDF) chairman 
Gilles Menage said in Hong Kong. 
  "It will be situated practically in the same place -- three 
or four kilometers from the existing site," he said. But he 
added that the Chinese authorities have yet to spell out under 
what terms the plant would be built. EDF played a major role in 
building the 1,800-megawatt, twin-reactor Daya Bay complex, 50 
kilometers (30 miles) from Hong Kong, and it is keen to play a 
role in the new venture. 
  Publicly, China has yet to declare whether it will put the 
long-mooted second Guangdong nuclear plant at Lingao, five 
kilometers northeast of Daya Bay, or at Yangjiang, on the 
western side of the province. "Each site has its own advantages 
and disadvantages," the deputy head of public relations at Daya 
Bay, Chen Zhenyu, said at Sunday's formal launch of Daya Bay's 
first reactor, which Menage attended. 
  The central government in Beijing is said to prefer Lingao, 
which independent-minded provincial leaders favor Yangjiang. 
EDF, a French state company that is world's biggest generator 
of electricity, was overall technical consultant at Daya Bay. 
Its staff is staying on to oversee the training of its Chinese 
personnel. Daya Bay's proximity to Hong Kong has aroused safety 
concerns in the territory, but EDF executives say that since its 
conception, Chinese officials have strived to match Western 
safety standards. 
  Menage also said EDF was pursuing talks with Hong Kong's 
biggest utility, China Light and Power Co. Ltd. -- which owns 25 
percent of Daya Bay -- on a possible joint venture of their own 
in China. "I believe that we may be able to say more in the 
coming weeks," he said. Hong Kong press reports last October 
said EDF and China Light were discussing a 2.5 billion US dollar 
joint venture to erect three 1,200-megawatt electric power 
stations in eastern Shandong province.

<F P=106> [By Martin Lee, chairman of the United Democrats of Hong </F>
Kong] 
  [Text] Governor Chris Patten recently said that as 1997 
drew closer, he planned to spend more time "in the back of the 
car" -- presumably so Hong Kong people could take a brief turn 
at the wheel. 
  Since he has revealed his desire to do this, it is worth 
assessing how far along the road to autonomy Hong Kong has 
travelled during his tenure. 
  Ten years after the Joint Declaration was signed, the power 
to control Hong Kong's destiny was supposed to be firmly in the 
hands of Hong Kong people. Instead, it increasingly looks as if 
the territory will merely change from having one 
undemocratically chosen and unaccountable British chief 
executive to an equally unaccountable one under China. 
  Patten arrived after successive British colonial governments 
relegated Hong Kong people to the position of powerless and 
almost irrelevant bystanders in decisions about our own future. 
  He pledged to do otherwise. But in many critical ways his 
tenure has further entrenched the colonial establishment and 
concentrated all governing power in the hands of the executive. 
The losers are the people of Hong Kong. 
  While the Governor has volunteered to respond to legislative 
councillors' queries in scheduled "question times", this is only 
a cosmetic change -- the first chief executive of the Special 
Administrative Region can simply refuse to turn up to do this. 
  Much more relevant are the steps Patten has not taken in the 
Legislative Council [Legco]. For instance, of the 34 motion 
debates held by Legco last year, he either openly refused to, or 
has failed to take action on more than 40 percent of them. So 
while the Governor professes to want to let the people of Hong 
Kong drive, it is evident he will not let go of the wheel. 
  Patten's most damaging mistake has been the decision to 
exclude all of Hong Kong's democratically elected 
representatives from the policy-making Executive Council [Exco]. 
Instead of using Exco as a genuine cabinet to govern in 
co-ordination with the local leaders who will have to manage the 
territory after 1997, he has taken greater personal and direct 
control over the body. 
  Under Patten, not a single Exco member has been elected by, 
or is accountable to, anyone but Patten himself. So instead of 
a cabinet that can feel the pulse of Hong Kong our chief 
policy-making body is little more than an annex to Patten's 
personal fiction. The result is that all major decisions are 
made by a man who will leave in three years. 
  Patten has also resisted calls to establish an independent 
human rights commission and opposes the Access to Information 
Bill which would promote a truly open and accountable government. 
  He has announced plans to set up a Court of Final Appeal 
based on the secret Sino-British deal condemned by Legco, and 
his government has long dragged its heels in striking down 
colonial laws that clearly contravene the Bill of Rights. 
  Patten enjoys a wide reputation as the champion of 
democracy, 
but there is no real evidence as yet that his government is any 
more democratic or any more accountable than under his colonial 
predecessors. 
  Nor has there been a change in the longstanding policy of 
the 
British government of negotiating with Beijing over the heads of 
the people of Hong Kong. The Governor has repeatedly refused to 
allow a referendum on the electoral arrangements for the 1994-95 
elections, in spite of his oft-stated objective of letting the 
people of Hong Kong have a say in their future. 
  For Hong Kong people to rule Hong Kong with a meaningful 
degree of autonomy after 1997, we must be allowed to take 
control of our own destiny now. 
  Patten must appoint democratically-elected local leaders to 
Exco and turn the Government into one that is at last managed by 
the people of the territory. 
  He must allow such a locally-constituted government to stand 
up for itself and deal with Beijing. And Hong Kong's affairs 
must be decided openly by the people of the territory, not in 
secret by British and Chinese diplomats. 
  If we are not ruling ourselves with autonomy under a British 
administration accountable to a democratic parliament, it is 
naive to think Beijing will allow us to rule ourselves after 
1997. 
  Patten must not only take the back seat, he must take 
responsibility for realizing the "one country, two systems" 
objective by establishing the institutions that will allow Hong 
Kong its promised post-1997 self-government. 
  And on June 30, 1997, when the last Governor leaves, he must 
be able to say the institutions he has left behind will preserve 
our individual freedoms through the rule of law and provide a 
system of local, accountable government. 
  He can only do this by respecting the wishes of the people 
of 
Hong Kong and those who have been democratically elected to 
represent them.

<F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung] </F>
  [Text] Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang said 
yesterday the Government had to keep the latest financial 
proposal for the Chek Lap Kok airport secret to ensure an early 
agreement with China. Despite being pressed by legislators to 
reveal the fourth financial package at yesterday's Legislative 
Council Finance Committee meeting, Mrs. Chan said it was not in 
the public interest to disclose the package yet. She said a new 
package had been handed to the Chinese side and the Government 
had pressed for a meeting with China to conclude an early deal. 
  Pro-China legislator Tam Yiu-chung said recent press reports 
contained details of the financing plan and queried whether it 
was the Government or Executive Councillors who had failed to 
heed the confidentiality rule. Pointing out he did not support 
the Government' move to pump more funds into airport projects at 
this stage, Mr. Tam asked whether such a move would dampen the 
chances of striking a deal with China. But Mrs. Chan said it 
was needed to avoid any delay, and none of the items needed 
consultation with China. 
  Apart from Mr. Tam and Philip Wong Yu-hong, the Finance 
Committee voted for four funding proposals totaling $4.7 billion 
at 1997 prices relating to the airport core programme projects 
including: 
--$1.3 billion for the remaining works of the Lantau Fixed 
Crossing --$145 million for certain airport railway advance 
works --$1.9 billion to provide infrastructure for the Tung 
Chung phase I 
  New town and the new airport--$1.4 billion for government 
facilities at the Chek Lap Kok Airport. 
  Members pressed the Government to promise completing the 
Kowloon to Chek Lap Kok Airport rail link by mid-1997 but the 
Government was unable to assure them. Principal Assistant 
Secretary for Transport, Arthur Ng, would only say the 
Government hoped the section could be finished by June 1997 to 
coincide with the airport's opening. 
  He also failed to give a date beyond which the airport 
railway could not be completed as scheduled. Meanwhile, 
legislators approved a funding proposal to allocate $6.8 billion 
as an initial capital injection to a sewage services trading 
fund to finance the construction of the high priority programme.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No Time To Trivialise Human Rights"] </F>
  [Text] The news that Chinese authorities have released 
three political prisoners is indeed welcome. But we are 
profoundly uneasy about how China's Western critics have been 
drawn into what one human rights group described as "a cynical 
trade in political prisoners". 
  Both sides -- not just China -- are treating prisoners of 
conscience as mere tokens, commodities suitable to be bartered 
for tariff reductions, export quotas, satellites, or arms 
proliferation deals. 
  Xiao Bin's only crime was to tell a U.S. television reporter 
what he had heard about the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in Beijing. 
His mistake was to speak in front of a camera. For this he was 
sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
  The other two freed dissidents had also been convicted of 
"counter-revolutionary crime". Ding Junze, a philosophy 
instructor in Shanxi had been sentenced to 12 years for the 
crime of "inciting anti-government activities." 
  Liao Yiwu, a Sichuan poet, was sentenced to four years for 
"antigovernment activities." This, apparently, was the making 
of an art video which expressed sympathy for the victims of the 
1989 massacre. 
  Under China's legal code counter-revolution is defined as 
"all acts...committed with the goal of overthrowing the 
political power of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the 
socialist system." It embraces "acts" of speech deemed to be 
"counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement." 
  The existence of this so-called "law" is the sole basis for 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin's fraudulent claim that 
China has no political prisoners. 
  Wu's preposterous statement last Thursday that the 
functioning of China's judiciary "is something that the Chinese 
government cannot interfere in" was a bald application of the 
"Big Lie" techniques first perfected by Stalin and his 
apologists. 
  We are expected to believe that the trials of political 
dissidents in China remotely resemble due process, and that they 
are not carried out strictly according to the instructions of 
party leaders. 
  Wu's smug defence of China's suppression of dissent as 
"legal" and therefore unrelated to human rights is bad enough. 
  Equally cynical, however, are the circumstances surrounding 
the release of Xiao, Ding and Liao, just one day after the 
release of the U.S. State Department report on human rights. 
  We are poised for another round of cynical manipulation as 
the annual charade of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status 
negotiations meander to a conclusion on June 4, exactly five 
years after the Tiananmen uprising. 
  What began as a sincere impulse to help the victims of 
political oppression in China has been degraded to the lowest 
form of political theater. 
  Yesterday's reported release is only the first act in this 
year's MFN circus. China will play its part by releasing a few 
more political prisoners, agreeing to prison visits by the 
International Red Cross, and making reassuring noises about arms 
proliferation and helping to curb North Korea's nuclear 
ambitions. 
  The Clinton administration will deliberate meaningfully 
before finally pronouncing these concessions "significant, 
overall", and therefore sufficient to justify extending China's 
MFN status one more time. 
  Congress, after a series of gestures to demonstrate the 
purity of its commitment to human rights, will agree -- with 
reservations -- that China does deserve to keep MFN after all. 
  What are rational people to make of this? The starting point 
should be to state unambiguously that it is inexcusable for 
there to be political prisoners in China and everywhere else. 
It is even less acceptable for them to be treated inhumanely. 
  There are certain universal standards of acceptable behavior 
which the international community has a responsibility to try to 
uphold. 
  China, as a member of this community, cannot expect to be 
immune from pressure on this front. 
  The question is how can pressure be best applied? Most 
useful of all may be simply to communicate to Beijing, as 
clearly and as often as possible, what are seen as minimum 
standards of decency for a civilized society, and to identify 
where we believe China does not measure up. 
  Trade policy and sanctions have so far proved a blunt and 
not 
very effective tool for protecting or developing these freedoms 
in China, or anywhere else. 
  However satisfying the rhetoric sounds, the use of real 
sanctions, like revoking MFN, may strengthen the reactionary and 
repressive elements in the Chinese leadership. 
  But what we dislike most of all is the trivialization of 
human rights in China into an excuse for empty rhetoric and 
political posturing by U.S. politicians, none of whom will ever 
have to live with the consequences of their actions.

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong's 
property stocks are set to hit new highs despite the 80 percent 
rise in property stock prices since last August, according to 
Salomon Brothers, one of the world's leading investment banks. 
  In its latest Hong Kong property equity research paper, the 
firm said strong earning growth from the swift land price rises 
and the steep rent hikes from 1993 onwards should combine with 
the expansion in the sector's price/earning ratios to take stock 
prices to new highs. 
  The paper, entitled "Major Re-Rating Awaits Property Stocks 
in 1994", said the key drivers of the re-rating will be the 
dissipation of the fear that Hong Kong will suffer from a mass 
exodus of residents and capital ahead of 1997 and the 
realization that the property market is well supported by strong 
incomes that China has helped generate and is not an asset 
bubble. 
  China is a major source of long-term opportunities for Hong 
Kong property companies and not a source of political risk, 
which pressures immovable assets like property, the paper said. 
  Another factor pushing the re-rating is that the market is 
starting to accept a valuation paradigm that values certain 
quality property stocks on an earning multiple basis, which 
recognizes these companies as generators of long-term earnings. 
  Salomon Brothers, in the Asia Pacific region outside Japan, 
has branches or representative offices in Bangkok, Seoul, 
Singapore and Taipei, with the regional headquarters in Hong 
Kong.

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Yeung] </F>
  [Text] China is to name up to 400 community leaders to 
serve as District Affairs Advisers with the first batch of about 
100 to be appointed this month, sources say. Days after their 
appointment premier Li Peng is to renew the appointment of the 
first batch of 43 Hong Kong Affairs Advisers in Shenzhen on 
March 2. The 43 received notification at the weekend from the 
local branch of XINHUA (the New China News Agency) for the 
Shenzhen trip. 
  Now on a swing in the southern cities including Zhuhai and 
Shenzhen, the premier is scheduled to make his second tour to 
the border city early next month to attend a celebration of the 
completion of a mammoth water supply facility from the East 
River to Hong Kong. 
  The strengthening of united front work comes as the first 
piece of legislation on the 1994/95 elections is about to be 
passed by the Legislative Council and the remaining 
controversial parts are due to be tabled in the legislature. 
  According to sources close to XINHUA, the de facto embassy's 
three district offices have begun finalizing the list of the 
first batch of District Affairs Advisers. Formal invitation is 
scheduled to be extended by heads of the three district offices 
in Kowloon, Hong Kong Island and Sha Tin in the next fortnight. 
The official appointment is expected to be made by the local 
director of XINHUA, Zhou Nan. Unlike the Hong Kong Affairs 
Advisers who were jointly appointed by XINHUA and the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Offce, the newly-created District Affairs 
Advisers will only come under XINHUA. 
  The first batch of District Affairs Advisers would include 
members of the district boards, area committees and mutual aid 
committees which form the skeleton of the lower-tier political 
structure under the British administration. A number of 
District Affairs Advisers will be chosen from the hundreds of 
traditional kaifong associations, residents groups and 
neighborhood bodies in the territory. The source said it was 
almost certain that core leaders from the United Democrats, seen 
as subversive, would be excluded. But members of other liberal 
political groups such as the Association for Democracy and 
People's Livelihood might be enlisted. 
  The source maintained that, like the Hong Kong Affairs 
Advisers, the District Affairs Advisers would not be working as 
a group. "They will have regular meetings with XINHUA officials 
and be consulted on territory matters," the source said. 
  The appointment of District Affairs Advisers means China 
will 
have its own three-tier consultative network in Hong Kong. Top 
of the structure is the 30 Hong Kong members in the 57 strong 
Preliminary Working Committee, which was formed under the 
National People's Congress Standing Committee last summer to 
pave the way for the setting up of the post 1997 region. 
Further down will be the Hong Kong Affairs Advisers of which 91 
local leaders in two batches have been named since 1992. The 
third batch is expected to be appointed next month. The next 
structure will be District Affairs Advisers, the idea for which 
apparently came from Hong Kong people. 
  Beijing decided to seriously consider the idea about "one to 
two months" ago in the face of the breakdown of Sino-British 
talks, the source said.

  [Text] Macao, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Macao Governor General 
Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira met here today with the visiting 
Chinese Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong. 
  The two sides mainly exchanged views on the construction of 
the Macao International Airport. 
  Huang said after the meeting that he was convinced the 
airport would be completed very soon under the friendly 
cooperation of the two sides, which would make the dream of 
Macao residents of generations to have their own airport come 
true. 
  He added, the completion of the airport would bring great 
benefits to Macao residents and is expected to play an active 
role in improving Macao's investment environment and promoting 
local economic development. 
  Huang and his entourage arrived here Thursday [3 February] 
evening at the invitation of Macao governor.

  [Text] Macao, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Communications Minister Huang Zhendong said today that the 
construction of the Macao International Airport is of great 
significance and it will play an important role in promoting the 
economic development and political stability in the area.

he left here this morning. 
  He said the airport is the largest communications project in 
Macao's history. The completion of the airport will greatly 
improve Macao's investment environment and enhance local

<F P=106> [Report by Liu I-mei; from the "Hookup" program -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Senate adopted 92-8 the $12 billion State 
Department Authorization Act, which includes a bill submitted by 
Republican Senator Murkowski, chairman of the Senate 
Asia-Pacific Group, proposing the arms sale provision in the 
Taiwan Relations Act -- which is related to the part on arms 
sales in the 17 August Communique signed between the United 
States and the Chinese Communists in 1982 -- be changed to 
permit an increase in defensive weapon sales to China [Taiwan], 
instead of gradually reducing them. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomed the move after the 
news was learned in Taipei. An official of the ministry said: 
Although the bill has not been adopted, it shows that the 
Senate has begun to highly assess the efforts made by our side 
following the break in Sino-U.S. diplomatic relations 15 years 
ago. The State Department [words indistinct]. The amendment 
bill concerning our country submitted by Murkowski also included 
the following issues: President Clinton should send 
cabinet-level officials to visit China [Taiwan]; discussion of 
the annual report on Sino-U.S. economic cooperation submitted by 
the State Department; and that Americans of Chinese origin 
should be allowed to stamp Taiwan as their place of birth in 
their American passports. 
  The official said: After the Senate adopted the 
authorization Act by an overwhelming majority, the Senate and 
House will hold separate meetings in the near future to 
deliberate the articles of the Authorization Act and the 
amendment bill. After a consensus is reached, the package will 
be sent to the White House to be signed by President Clinton. 
Once it is signed by the President, it must be carried out by 
administrative departments. [words indistinct]

<F P=106> [By Dennis Engbarth in Taipei] </F>
  [Text] Taiwan's premier called on Chinese leader Deng 
Xiaoping to "make a historic decision" to promote unification 
and not annex Taiwan. 
  Speaking yesterday, premier Lien Chan stated that Taipei's 
mainland policy was based on the situation that "there is one 
China, but that it is divided" and that the "Republic of China" 
holds the power of rule over the "Taiwan, Penghu, Matsu and 
Kinmen area". He said: "There is no deep seated hatred between 
the peoples on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Today's task 
is to create for the next generation a free, stable and 
prosperous future," the premier said. 
  Relations between Taipei and Beijing "should not be based on 
ideas of life or death (you die, I live) or on the big consuming 
the small or suffocating the other side," he added. "This would 
be not unification but annexation," Mr. Lien declared. 
  Mr. Lien said he doubted whether simply elevating the level 
of current talks between Beijing and Taipei would lead to 
realization of the five-point accord signed in Singapore last 
April between unofficial representatives from Beijing and Taipei. 
  While denying that Taipei was engaging in "money diplomacy," 
Mr. Lien acknowledged that "our biggest bargaining chip in 
foreign relations is our economic strength". 
  A key focus of Taipei's international thrust would be the 
so- 
called "Southern Policy" which aims to encourage Taiwan 
businessmen to invest in Southeast Asia. He said the policy 
came about because we "did not want to place all of its economic 
development on one place", referring to the growing trade and 
investment with mainland China. 
  The premier's trip to Malaysia and Singapore to promote the 
policy would be followed by a similar "vacation visit" by 
President Lee Teng-hui to Bali, Indonesia and Thailand next 
week, Taiwan diplomatic sources said.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
will actively prepare to bid for the sponsorship of the Asian 
Games and the East Asian Games, Premier Lien Chan said Friday [4 
February]. 
  In his year-end news conference, Lien said upgrading sports 
facilities islandwide is one of the 12 major tasks the 
government will promote in the new year. 
  Better sports facilities, including hardware and software, 
will help Taiwan win its bid to host international sports 
activities, such as the Asian Games and the East Asian Games, 
Lien said. 
  An interministerial task force to help win sponsorship of 
the 
2000 Asian Games and the 1999 East Asian Games was formally 
established Friday by the Executive Yuan. 
  The task force, in its first meeting Friday chaired by Vice 
Premier Hsu Li-teh, agreed to decide which city will host the 
games by March 31 and file the application to the Asian Olympics 
Committee by June 20. 
  The meeting also decided that athletes and sports staff from 
Mainland China, whether they are Chinese Communist Party members 
or not, need not report their exit and entry during the games. 
  And issues concerning national anthems and team flags will 
be 
handled according to Asian Olympics and international Olympics 
regulations, the task force said. 
  So far, both the capital city Taipei in the north and 
seaport 
city Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan have expressed strong desires 
to host the games.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan toured 
Taipei vegetable and fish wholesale markets early Saturday [5 
February] morning to make sure a sufficient supply of the 
products exists for holiday demand. 
  After hearing a brief report by the government-funded Taipei 
Agricultural Products Company, which assured Lien that supplies 
of all products are sufficient, Lien expressed his satisfaction 
over the bounty and wished a happy New Year to all market 
workers. 
  In addition to raising questions about product prices and 
market administration, Lien told Taipei City Mayor Huang 
Ta-chou, who accompanied Lien during the inspection tour, that 
the city government should continue its efforts to promote 
automation of and direct sales from production sites to offer 
better service to consumers. 
  The supply of vegetables, fruit, fish and meat has increased 
by as much as 60 percent with the coming of the holidays, and 
the supply of flowers and potted plants -- used for holiday 
ornamentation -- has increased by 20 percent. 
  Calyx canthus, gladioli, chrysanthemums, lilies and 
anthuriums are especially popular this time of year, and their 
prices are an average of 10 percent higher than they were for 
last year's lunar new year. 
  This is the first time that Lien has toured the two 
wholesale 
markets since he assumed the premiership a year ago. The 
markets will close on Feb. 10, New Year's Day, and reopen on 
Feb. 15. 
  Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry under 
the Taiwan provincial government also instructed all county and 
city authorities to increase supplies of all kinds of 
necessities to satisfy the growing holiday demand.

<F P=106> [By reporters Fan Liqing (5400 7787 7230) and Fang Jin (2455 </F>
3866)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- The meeting on issues of 
routine affairs between Tang Shubei, executive vice president of 
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS], 
and Zou Zhekai, vice president and secretary general of ARATS, 
on the one hand; and Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho], vice chairman 
and secretary general of the SEF [Straits Exchange Foundation], 
on the other, which began on 1 February, ended today after 
reaching a consensus. Both sides will hold the fourth round of 
talks in late March this year in order to reach a consensus on 
the text of the agreement on the three issues of routine affairs. 
  Following conclusion of the talks, Tang Shubei said that 
after four days of earnest discussions and common efforts, both 
sides had reached understandings on the following issues: 
  1. Both sides feel that they have reached a wide range of 
understanding on three issues of routine affairs, including the 
"repatriation of hijackers," the "repatriation of personnel who 
enter the other side's territory in violation of relevant 
regulations and other related questions," and the "handling of 
maritime disputes in the Taiwan Straits." Both sides agreed 
that this has laid a good foundation for the holding of the 
fourth round of talks and the signing of a written agreement. 
Both sides have agreed to hold a meeting at the vice secretary 
general level in Beijing in late March in order to reach a 
consensus on the draft agreement on the three issues. Jiao 
Renhe hoped that Tang Shubei and his ARATS counterparts will 
proceed to sign a formal agreement in Taipei on the basis of the 
draft agreement. 
  2. Both sides have also agreed that during the fourth 
working meeting to be held in late March between the two 
organizations, both sides will hold formal discussions on other 
topics included in the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu [Ku] 
Talks." The topics of discussions will include the protection 
of intellectual property rights; joint operations against 
maritime smuggling, robbery, and other criminal activities in 
the Taiwan Straits; and economic, scientific, and technological 
exchanges and cooperation. 
  3. Entrusted by ARATS President Wang Daohan, Tang Shubei 
handed Wang's letter to Jiao Renhe on 1 February, inviting SEF 
Chairman Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] to visit the mainland this year. 
Jiao Renhe said he would actively create conditions for the 
second meeting between Wang and Gu. The time and venue of the 
Wang-Gu meeting will be discussed at the March meeting. 
  4. The two sides also agreed to assist each other in the 
handling of the inherited property of some of the personnel who 
left the mainland for Taiwan [before 1949]. 
  On the basis of reaching the above understandings, both 
sides 
will publish a news release tomorrow. 
  Tang Shubei said after holding discussions, both sides have 
enhanced mutual understanding and promoted the formation of 
consensus. This fact shows once again that high-level 
face-to-face meetings are very important because it is conducive 
to increasing mutual trust and reaching mutual understanding. 
The current visit to Beijing by Jiao Renhe for discussions in 
this meeting was absolutely necessary. He said it is in this 
scene that President Wang Daohan has invited Chairman Gu Zhenfu 
to visit the mainland. 
  After the conclusion of the talks, Jiao Renhe also said: The 
method and attitude adopted by both sides for discussing issues 
were conducive to their solution. After long hours of 
discussions, both sides have reached an understanding. They 
will proceed quickly to make arrangements for the next round of 
consultations on issues of routine affairs.

routine affairs, and relevant issues. Both sides reached a 
consensus on the following issues:

political issues in a practical attitude when holding talks on 
routine affairs. Both sides have discussed three topics on 
routine affairs, including the "Repatriation of Personnel Who 
Have Entered Into the Area of the Other Side in Violation of 
Relevant Regulations, and Related Issues," and have reached a 
high degree of consensus, but they still should make efforts to 
iron out certain differences so as to reach an agreement in

consultation to hold the fourth round of talks on routine 
affairs in Beijing in late March and have decided that, after an 
agreement is reached in the talks, it will be signed by ARATS

Assistance Between Related Law Courts (Mutual Assistance Between 
Judicial Organs on Both Sides of the Taiwan Strait)," and 
certain economic, scientific, and technological topics included 
in the "Joint Agreement Reached by Wang-Gu [Ku] Talks." 
  2. Both sides have decided through consultation on the 
"Measures Facilitating the Entry and Exit by ARATS and SEF 
Affairs Working Personnel," and have decided to implement them 
by treating the exchange of correspondences through mail as 
taking effect. 
  3. Both sides have agreed in principle to increase the 
categories of copies of notarization documents according to the 
second article of the "Cross-Strait Agreement on the 
Verification of Notarization Documents." Specific items will be 
decided upon through another consultation. 
  4. Both sides are willing to assist each other on issues 
relating to the Cross-Strait inheritance of property. 
  5. Both sides have agreed they will continue to promote the 
activities of mutual visits by responsible persons of the media, 
reporters, and scientific and technological personnel as well as 
the exchange of teenager. 
  Both sides will continue to implement all the agreements 
reached by the "Wang-Gu talks," maintain a smooth channel for 
ARATS-SEF contacts and talks, and create favorable conditions 
for the second "Wang-Gu talks."

<F P=106> [By reporter Lu Junjun (7120 8823 8823): "The Association </F>
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and the Straits Exchange 
Foundation Issue a Joint News Release on Talks Between Mr. Tang 
Shubei and Mr. Chiao Jen-ho"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Tang Shubei, 
executive vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across 
the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], and Chiao Jen-ho, vice president and 
secretary general of the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], 
signed a "Joint News Bulletin on the Talks Between Mr. Tang 
Shubei and Mr. Chiao Jen-ho" this morning. 
  The content of the joint news bulletin is as follows: 
  Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of the ARATS, and Zou 
Zhekai, vice chairman and secretary general of the ARATS, held 
talks with Chiao Jen-ho, resident vice president and secretary 
general of the corporate SEF, in Beijing from 1 to 5 February, 
discussing topics concerning the operation of the two 
organizations, other operational matters, and other issues. The 
two sides have reached a common understanding as stated below: 
  1. Both sides maintain that they should adopt a pragmatic 
attitude and avoid political issues in the talks between them on 
operational matters. The two sides have just discussed three 
topics concerning operational matters, including the "issue of 
repatriation of personnel entering the other side's domain in 
violation of the relevant regulations and other concerned 
matters." They have reached a very close, common understanding 
in this regard, but efforts have yet to be made to iron out some 
differences between them so that a written agreement can be 
concluded as soon as possible. The two sides have agreed to 
hold the fourth round of talks on operational matters in Beijing 
in the latter half of March, and an agreement, if concluded, 
will be signed by the persons in charge of the two parties in 
Taipei. During the fourth round of talks on operational 
matters, the two sides will also exchange views on or discuss 
the following areas: The issue "of joint operation against 
smuggling and robbery at sea and other criminal activities," the 
issue of "mutual protection of intellectual property rights," 
"contact and mutual assistance between courts on the two shores 
of the strait (mutual assistance between judicial organs on the 
two shores of the strait)," and certain topics concerning the 
fields of economy and science and technology that are listed in 
the "Joint Agreement of the Wang Daohan-Ku Chengfu talks." 
  2. The two sides have agreed on the "procedures to 
accommodate exchange of visits by staff of the ARATS and the SEF 
between the two shores," which have come into effect by an 
exchange of documents. 
  3. The two sides have agreed in principle to expand the 
range 
of variety of copies of notarial documents to be exchanged 
between the two shores, in accordance with Article 2 of the 
"Agreement on the Use and Verification of Notarial Documents 
Between the Two Shores." Further discussion will be held to set 
out detailed procedures. 
  4. The two sides will extend assistance to each other on 
inheritance matters. 
  5. The two sides have agreed to make continued efforts this 
year to promote exchanges of visits between mass media leading 
staff members, young people, and scientific and technological 
personnel on the two shores of the strait. 
  The two sides will continue to comprehensively implement all 
the agreements concluded through the Wang Daohan-Ku Chengfu 
talks, keep the contact and negotiating channels operating 
smoothly between them, and thus pave the way for the second Wang 
Daohan-Ku Chengfu talks.

  [Text] Beijing, February 5 (XINHUA) -- ARATS and SEF today 
published a joint news release listing five understandings on 
Taiwan Straits matters, reached in their five days of talks here. 
  Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of the Association of 
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on the mainland, and 
Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and secretary general of the 
Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), signed the 
release today after five days of discussions. 
  The five understandings listed by the news release were: 
  First, both sides agreed that sensitive political issues 
should be avoided in a pragmatic manner in discussing routine 
matters. 
  They discussed three routine issues, including the 
repatriation of personnel who cross the Taiwan Straits in 
violation of relevant regulations and related issues, and have 
reached deep common understanding on them, the news release said. 
  However, they will step up efforts to solve some remaining 
differences so as to reach a written agreement as soon as 
possible, the release said. 
  They have agreed to hold their fourth talks on routine 
matters in late March in Beijing and sign an agreement in 
Taipei, if an agreement is reached. During the fourth talks, 
they will discuss jointly fighting against maritime smuggling, 
piracy and other criminal activities, the protection of 
intellectual property rights on the two sides of the Taiwan 
Straits, contacts and mutual aid between courts on both sides of 
the straits, and some economic, scientific and technological 
issues included in an agreement between ARATS President Wang 
Daohan and SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu last year. 
  Second, the two organisations agreed on methods to 
facilitate 
entrance and exit of personnel across the Taiwan Straits, which 
will be enforced in the form of an exchange of letters. 
  Third, both sides agreed to increase the variety of 
duplicates of legal deeds to be sent to the other side of the 
Taiwan Straits. Details will be discussed later. 
  Fourth, both sides agreed to provide mutual help to resolve 
issues concerning inheritance. 
  Fifth, the two organisations agreed to promote mutual visits 
between news media officials, journalists, youth, and scientific 
and technological personnel. 
  They also said that they would thoroughly carry out various 
agreements reached during the Wang-Koo talks last year, keep in 
contact with each other and keep a smooth channel of talks to 
create favorable conditions for the second Wang-Koo meeting. 
  The news release was drafted by two vice-secretary generals 
appointed by ARATS and SEF last night. Tang Shubei and Chiao 
Jen-ho signed it after a discussion this morning.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 5 (AFP)--Chinese and Taiwan 
negotiators signed a joint communique here Saturday, indicating 
progress on a series of bilateral disputes and the possible 
signing of a written accord in late March. 
  The communique came at the end of four days of talks here 
between Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) 
and its mainland counterpart, the Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS). 
  While a "high-level of understanding" had been reached on 
certain issues, further efforts are needed to overcome remaining 
differences "so as to reach a written agreement as soon as 
possible," said the communique, signed by SEF and ARATS 
vice-chairmen Chiao Jen-ho and Tang Shubei. 
  Both sides have agreed to hold further working-level 
negotiations in Beijing during the last 10 days of March. Any 
agreement arising from those talks will then be signed in Taipei 
by the two vice-chairmen. 
  In a clear reference to the thorny question of Taiwan 
handing 
over mainland hijackers, the communique said only that a degree 
of consensus had been reached on the need to repatriate those 
who crossed the Taiwan Strait illegally. 
  The word "hijackers" was noticeably absent from the text, 
indicating continuing disagreement over the key issues of 
jurisdiction and sovereignty that have dominated the divisive 
repatriation dispute. 
  While both sides agree in principle that mainland Chinese 
who 
divert planes to the Nationalist island should eventually be 
repatriated, Beijing is unwilling to recognise Taipei's rights 
of jurisdiction in dealing with the hijackers. 
  China views Taiwan as a renegade province and refuses to 
take 
any steps that may be construed as a recognition of the island 
as a political entity. 
  However, Tang had said Thursday that the latest negotiations 
had seen "differences shrinking" over repatriation, illegal 
immigrants and fishing disputes. 
  The communique stressed that future negotiations should 
focus 
on the practicalities of cross-Strait relations and avoid 
sensitive legal or political issues. 
  According to the communique, the March talks will focus on 
combatting piracy, strengthening intellectual property rights 
and enhancing judicial cooperation. 
  They will also discuss a second summit meeting between the 
SEF and ARATS chairmen, Ku Chen-fu and Wang Daohan, who last met 
in Singapore in April. 
  Both sides also agreed to promote scientific and 
technological exchanges and reciprocal visits by Chinese and 
Taiwan journalists. 
  Chinese nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a 
civil war to the communists on the mainland. Beijing and Taipei 
both claim to be the legitimate government of all China.

<F P=106> [By reporters Fan Liqing (5400 7787 7230) and Fang Jin (2455 </F>
3866)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Feb (XINHUA) -- Tang Shubei, executive 
vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Straits [ARATS], held a news conference this afternoon to field 
reporters' questions on his talks with Jiao Renhe [Chiao 
Jen-ho], vice chairman and concurrently secretary general of 
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], over the past five 
days. In assessing the talks, he said: The joint press release 
born of the talks summarizes the results of the talks between 
the two organizations in Xiamen and Taibei [Taipei] following 
the "Wang-Gu [Ku] talks." It has positive implications for 
strengthening cooperation between the two organizations and for 
developing cross-strait relations. 
  Tang Shubei said: Because the Taiwan authorities last year 
raised the question of "joining the United Nations," the Chinese 
Government released a white paper entitled "The Taiwan Question 
and Reunification of China," which led to a sharp political 
standoff between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Mr. Jiao 
Renhe's current visit to Beijing for talks was good for the two 
sides' eschewing political issues to settle routine matters. We 
have always called on the two organizations to hold talks in the 
spirit of respecting each other, holding consultations on an 
equal basis, seeking truth from facts, and seeking common ground 
while reserving differences. During five days of talks, the two 
sides constantly coordinated their actions and reshaped their 
opinions in light of the other side's views, thereby bringing 
about an outcome that is acceptable to both sides. This 
outcome, which was born of enhanced trust between the two sides, 
is, in turn, good for increasing mutual trust. 
  In response to questions on the significance of explicitly 
including in the joint press release plans for the two 
organizations to exchange views or hold talks on a number of 
economic, scientific, and technological issues during their 
fourth round of talks on routine matters, Tang Shubei said: 
ARATS has always called for incorporating the economic topics, 
outlined in the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks," in the 
agenda at the earliest possible date. Given the current 
political differences between the two sides of the Taiwan 
Strait, we believe that economic exchanges and cooperation can 
promote closer relations between the two sides and that shared 
economic benefits will widen our common political language. 
Talks between the two organizations currently stress the 
settlement of routine matters stemming from cross-strait 
exchanges. Although this is the duty of both organizations, we 
believe it is more important to promote the favorable 
development of cross-strait relations through contacts and 
cooperation between the two organizations. In this sense, 
economic topics represent a very important aspect and are 
forward-looking. The two organizations should actively promote 
the development of cross-strait economic exchanges and 
cooperation. 
  On the question of protecting Taiwan entrepreneurs' rights 
and interests regarding their investments on the mainland, Tang 
Shubei said: The mainland has drafted the "Law on Protecting 
the Investments of Taiwan Compatriots on the Mainland" after 
reviewing the 22-article regulations on encouraging Taiwan 
compatriots to invest on the mainland, after considering the 
views of the SEF and Taiwan entrepreneurs, and after repeatedly 
carrying out investigations and studies. Once it is approved by 
the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the law will 
serve as the single supreme law on the mainland that guarantees 
Taiwan entrepreneurs' investment rights and interests. We are 
not against holding discussions with the SEF on protecting 
Taiwan entrepreneurs' rights and interests. We also hope to 
include relevant economic topics during our fourth round of 
talks. In accordance with the principle of mutual benefit and 
reciprocity, we expressed our hope that Taiwan would open its 
markets to mainland products, loosen restrictions forbidding 
people from the mainland's industrial and business circles to 
visit Taiwan, and carry out cross-strait cooperation in labor 
services. On the basis of these moves, we do not exclude the 
possibility of signing a people-to-people agreement with the SEF 
on protecting Taiwan entrepreneurs' investment rights and 
interests. 
  Asked by a reporter about his impression of Jiao Renhe, the 
SEF vice chairman cum secretary general, Tang Shubei said: When 
I first met and talked with Mr. Jiao, I had the feeling that he, 
like his predecessors, was willing to actively promote the 
development of cross-strait relations. Despite our differing 
political stands, we share a desire to develop cross-strait 
relations. Consequently, the two sides were able to surmount 
difficulties and to reach several common understandings. 
  In response to the question of whether ARATS will set up an 
office in Hong Kong, Tang Shubei noted: ARATS has not 
considered this. The main targets of ARATS' contact are the SEF 
and various mass organizations and people from all walks of life 
in Taiwan. Now that the two organizations have established 
channels of communication and are in close contact, there is no 
need to set up a branch office in Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [Report by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Weiwei (7115 4850 </F>

(0491 2182 5391), and XINHUA reporter Zou Aoguo (6760 1947 0948)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- Today marked the 
beginning of spring. The CPC Central Committee held a Spring 
Festival discussion meeting with non-communist party figures at 
Zhongnanhai this afternoon. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of 
the CPC Central Committee, met happily with responsible figures 
from the various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of 
Industry and Commerce [ACFIC], and non-party affiliated figures 
to discuss state affairs, while ringing out the old and ushering 
in the new year. 
  In his speech, Jiang Zemin said: The basic principle of our 
party and state work in 1994 is: Under Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line, to comprehensively implement the 
guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress, as well as by 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to 
accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic 
system; to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 
6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy while 
safeguarding political stability, and promoting all-round social 
progress. Our overriding task for the current year is to seize 
the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside 
world, promote development, and maintain stability. Relevant 
work in various fields must be subordinate to and serve this 
overriding task. 
  The discussion meeting was presided over by Li Ruihuan, 
member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Political Bureau and 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. Hu Jintao, Li 
Lanqing, Wang Hanbin, We Xueqian, Wang Zhaoguo, and other 
leading comrades attended the meeting. 
  Fei Xiaotong, chairman of the Central Committee of the China 
Democratic League; Sun Qimeng, chairman of the Central Committee 
of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Lei 
Jieqiong, chairman of the Central Committee of the China 
Association for Promoting Democracy; and Wang Guangying, 
honorary chairman of the ACFIC successively spoke at the 
meeting. They spoke freely about the brilliant achievements 
made by China on various fronts under the CPC's leadership last 
year; they lauded the constant strengthening and development of 
multi-party cooperation under the CPC leadership. They said: 
The basic principle for 1994 put forward by the CPC Central 
Committee is of great importance. Members of various democratic 
parties and the ACFIC, as well as figures without party 
affiliation must strive to accomplish the grand objectives set 
out by the CPC Central Committee, and to perform new meritorious 
services. In the course of their speeches, they expressed their 
views and put forward proposals for developing the economy, 
reform and opening up, building an honest government, the 
construction of spiritual civilization, and educational work. 
  After the four non-party affiliated friends made their 
speeches, General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered an important 
speech. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State 
Council, he expressed sincere appreciation, and extended cordial 
greetings to all the friends present at the meeting, to comrades 
and friends from the various democratic parties and the ACFIC, 
and to figures without party affiliation. 
  Touching on last year's work, Jiang Zemin said: Under our 
party's leadership, 1993 witnessed people of all nationalities 
in our country comprehensively implement the guidelines laid 
down by the 14th CPC National Congress and advance triumphantly 
along the road of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The CPC Central Committee took the overall 
situation into consideration, paid special attention to a few 
major issues, maintained and developed a favorable situation for 
reform and opening up, and economic construction. To 
generalize, we mainly paid special attention to major issues in 
three aspects: First, through deepening reform we strengthened 
and improved macroeconomic regulation and control; adhered to 
the principle of promoting both material and spiritual 
civilization without relaxing efforts to attain either of them; 
promoted a rapid and sound development of the national economy; 
and gave an impetus to all-around progress in various social 
undertakings. The industrial sector maintained rapid growth, 
economic efficiency among enterprises was enhanced, the rural 
economy developed further, and construction of key projects was 
beefed up. We made new progress in propaganda and ideological 
work, in building spiritual civilization, and the anticorruption 
drive. Second, we convened the Third Plenary Session of the CPC 
Central Committee and adopted the "Decision on Some Issues 
Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic 
Structure"; and, formulated the overall plan and basic framework 
for establishing a socialist market economic system in our 
country, which is exerting and will continue to exert a far 
reaching impact on our efforts to push forward reform and open 
to the outside world, as well as on our modernization drive. 
Third, we earnestly organized the publicity and study drive of 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and 
launched activities to mark the birth centenary of Comrade Mao 
Zedong, thereby further uniting our people of all nationalities 
under the magnificent banner of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. At the same time, we also made new 
achievements in our party building, defense construction, and 
foreign affairs. All this has created favorable conditions for 
our continuous march forward in the new year. 
  After discussing the basic principles and general tasks of 
the party and government, Jiang Zemin said: The basic 
principles and general tasks set by the party Central Committee 
must be implemented in all sectors of society and all aspects of 
work, but first of all, in the vast countryside and state-owned 
enterprises. We must pay keen attention to the work in these two 
key areas in a bid to promote all-around reforms, development, 
and stability all over the country. 
  Jiang Zemin said: All in all, this year efforts must be 
focused on the following seven aspects: 1) Maintaining a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of the national economy and 
continuing to promote all-around social progress. We must rely 
on scientific and technological progress and improved quality of 
the work force to promote economic growth, paying particular 
attention to readjusting the structure and raising efficiency. 
We must also develop the rural economy in an all-around way, 
effectively build up the stamina of state-owned large and medium 
enterprises, strengthen and improve macroeconomic control and 
regulation, and go all out to advance educational, scientific, 
and technological undertakings. 2) Quickening the pace of 
reform in establishing a socialist market economic structure. 
We must make ample preparations for launching and implementing 
various major measures for establishing a sound macroeconomic 
control and regulation system, continue to change the operating 
mechanisms of state-owned enterprises, explore effective ways 
for establishing a modern enterprise system meeting the 
requirements of a socialist market economy, advance price reform 
in due course, and develop an integrated, open, competitive, and 
orderly market system. 3) Further improving propaganda and 
ideological work. We must pay close attention to and make the 
study and publicity of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping a fundamental task of ideological 
construction, and must earnestly implement the guidelines of the 
recent national propaganda and ideological work conference. 4) 
Actively promoting socialist democracy and the establishment of 
a legal system. We must persist in and perfect the system of 
people's congresses, and adhere to the system of multi-party 
cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist 
Party. We must continue to do a good job in the comprehensive 
management of public order to ensure social stability. 5) 
Stepping up the united front work during the current new period. 
We must, under the banner of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and patriotism, unite forces that can be united. 
We must bring into play the role of the CPPCC in exercising 
political consultation and democratic supervision. 6) Striving 
for an international environment favorable to reforms and 
construction in China. 7) Stepping up party building and the 
campaign to build a clean government. We must improve the 
quality of members of all leading bodies and the work force on 
all fronts, and enhance their ideological awareness and improve 
their work style. 
  Jiang Zemin emphasized: A correct understanding and proper 
handling of the relationships among reforms, development, and 
stability is vital to the fulfillment of various tasks this 
year. We have accumulated ample experiences in more than a 
decade of reform, which is designed to free and develop 
productive forces. The implementation of various reform measures 
is aimed at providing better institutional conditions for 
economic development. Therefore, we must imbue ourselves with an 
historical sense of urgency, while making solid, meticulous 
efforts to carry out each and every reform measure to ensure its 
success. Development is an essential criterion. We must firmly 
grasp the central task of economic construction at all times, 
never relaxing efforts nor wavering in the slightest degree. In 
terms of development, it is necessary to follow a new way of 
thinking. We must strive not only for an increase in the total 
volume of supply and demand in the economy but also, more 
importantly, attach importance to improving economic returns. 
Higher economic returns should be achieved by readjusting 
structure, upgrading technology, developing new products, and 
improving management, not by taking the old road of extensive 
management characterized by blindly seeking of output value and 
expansion of the investment scale. Stability is the 
prerequisite for reforms and development. To deepen reforms, 
open the country wider to the outside world, and promote 
all-around economic and social development, we must further 
maintain and consolidate the political situation marked by 
stability and unity. Meanwhile, only by persisting in reforms, 
opening up and developing the economy will it be possible to 
maintain stability in the long run. Therefore, we must 
understand correctly the dialectic unity between reform, 
development, and stability, which can promote one another. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Under the new situation in our efforts 
to push forward all-around reforms and accelerate the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure, it is 
extremely important to continuously carry forward the fine 
tradition of the party's mass line. No matter whether we make 
revolution or carry out reform and construction, we must show 
concern for the masses in every way, rely on the masses in all 
matters, and do everything for the sake of the masses. Herein 
lies the fundamental objective and line of work, as well as the 
distinct characteristics and superior political features of our 
party. As the times move ever forward and our undertakings 
develop further, we should all the more show our confidence in, 
concern for, and reliance on the masses [shi dai yue qian jin 
shi ye yue fa zhan wo men yue yao xin ren guan xin he yi kao qun 
zhong 2514 0108 6390 0467 6651 0057 2814 6390 4099 1455 2053 
0226 6390 6008 0207 0117 7070 1800 0735 0181 7237 5028 5883]; 
respect their wishes and pioneering spirit; and detect and solve 
in good time new problems cropping up on our road of advance so 
as to properly guide, safeguard, and harness the enthusiasm of 
the masses. In this way, we can constantly make new 
achievements in our reform and development, continuously 
safeguard social and political stability, and continuously push 
forward our cause of socialist modernization. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out: Over a long period in the past, 
comrades and friends of various democratic parties and the 
ACFIC, along with figures without party affiliation, have made 
use of their advantages to actively bring into play their role 
in participating in the administration and discussion of state 
affairs, and exercising democratic supervision. They have done 
a host of highly effective work in economic, scientific, and 
technological consultation, providing intellectual resources to 
support border and poor areas, establishing contacts abroad, and 
have served as links for importing foreign capital and 
technology; thus contributing significantly to propelling our 
country's reform and opening up policy and modernization drive. 
We believe in the new year, they will continue to stand 
alongside us and strive harder to uphold the principles of 
"long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, of showing utter 
devotion to each other, and sharing weal and woe together" while 
thinking over, discussing, and attending to major issues to make 
even greater contributions to the motherland's economic 
construction, reform, and opening up to the outside world. 
  Touching on the great cause of the motherland's 
reunification, Jiang Zemin said: It is a common desire of the 
entire people of China, as well as a development trend of the 
Chinese nation to accomplish the major undertaking of reunifying 
the motherland. We must continue to unswervingly push for 
reunification through a peaceful process in accordance with the 
principle of "one country, two systems." As far as the Taiwan 
issue is concerned, we are resolutely opposed to the concept of 
"two China's," "one Taiwan, one China" or "one country, two 
governments" in any form, and we will oppose any utterances and 
actions that are designed to create "Taiwan independence." With 
the date for the reversion of Hong Kong and Macao to the 
motherland drawing nearer and nearer, our task in this respect 
will definitely become increasingly more arduous. Whatever 
situation we may come across hereafter, we will accomplish this 
sacred mission entrusted to us by history according to schedule. 
We hope that friends outside our party will continue to carry 
out their work toward this end through various channels, at 
various levels, and in various fields and forms; and achieve new 
results in their efforts to realize the strategic concept of 
"one country, two systems," thereby accomplishing the great 
cause of the motherland's reunification. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: Currently, with the relatively 
favorable international environment, coupled with essential 
domestic conditions, and under the guidance of our party's basic 
line, the Chinese people are continuously advancing from victory 
to victory along the road of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. We have full confidence in the glorious future 
of our socialist motherland. Let us unite more closely, and 
strive to fulfill the various tasks for 1994. 
  Responsible officers of the various democratic parties and 
the ACFIC Central Committee, as well as nonparty figures who 
were also present at the meeting were: Li Peiyao, Peng 
Qingyuan, Qian Weichang, Ding Shisun, Wan Guoquan, Zhao Puchu, 
Chen Shunli, Lu Jiaxi, Fang Rongxin, Yang Jike, Xu Caidong, Cai 
Zimin, Sun Fuling, Jing Shuping, and Cheng Siyuan. 
  Responsible figures from relevant departments including Xu 
Ruixin, Jiang Minkuan, Wan Shaofen, Liu Yandong, Li Dezhu also 
attended the meeting.

<F P=106> [By Steve Ball in Shenzhen and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Excerpts] Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng has given 
Shenzhen a shot in the arm by endorsing its free-market reforms. 
The supportive statements of the senior cadre who will 
officiate at the opening of the Daya Bay nuclear plant tomorrow, 
were partly responsible for the 5.74 percent jump in the 
Shenzhen stock index yesterday. 
  Mr. Li arrived at the special economic zone early yesterday 
morning after a five-day inspection of neighboring Zhuhai. 
Security was extremely tight with police armed with sub-machine 
guns and assault rifles stationed on every road junction, while 
others patrolled in unmarked pick-up trucks. Mr. Li's motorcade 
had more than 30 motorcycle outriders and half a dozen station 
wagons with heavily armed escorts. 
  Sources in Shenzhen said Mr. Li, who has visited Shenzhen 
annually in the past few years, headed straight to the local 
bourse. "Li heaped praise on the stock exchange as a vehicle for 
raising capital and restructuring the state enterprise system," 
an informed source said. "The premier expressed confidence 
Shenzhen economy could cross a new threshold once every few 
years." 
  "However, the premier also told bourse staff that progress 
of 
the 'stocks system' must match the pace of development in the 
entire country." The source said his brief remarks were 
interpreted by brokers and investors as a pat on the back for 
Shenzhen and the Guangdong coast in general. 
  The Credit Lyonnais index for Shenzhen's A shares shot up 
98.09 points yesterday to close at the 1,807.18 mark. 
  During a previous visit to the Shenzhen bourse, the premier 
issued a stern warning against "speculationary activities" and 
insisted that the facility remained a "socialist stock exchange". 
  "Li listened to reports about Shenzhen's economic 
development 
the whole afternoon," a local journalist said last night. It is 
understood the premier gave instructions to a few cadres who 
would shortly take over leadership positions in the economic 
zone. 
  Local sources said Mr. Li would today tour major 
infrastructure projects in Shenzhen, including the new airport. 
Shenzhen officials said Mr. Li had shown "great personal 
concern" for the Daya Bay facility. [passage omitted] 
  Cadres in Shenzhen said yesterday at a time when hundreds of 
China's open cities had been granted "preferential policies" 
akin to those of the special economic zones, Mr. Li's remarks in 
the two zones were a great cause for reassurance. 
  As is the custom with the provincial tours of senior cadres, 
Mr. Li's presence in Shenzhen or Zhuhai was not recorded by 
local papers or TV stations. When told that it was Mr. Li who 
was in town, local residents expressed wishes he could use his 
authority for the benefit of the zone. One driver suggested 
that the premier take a good look at Shenzhen's roads. "The 
city Government never thought the place would develop this 
quickly," he said. "The cars and lorries are all over the 
place. It's a real mess."

<F P=106> [By reporters Jiang Zuozhong (3068 0146 0022) and He Ping </F>
(0149 1627)] 
  [Text] Shenzhen, 6 Feb (XINHUA) -- The No. 1 Generating 
Unit of Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant -- China's 
first large nuclear power plant built with foreign funds and 
advanced equipment and technology -- recently began commercial 
operation. Li Peng, premier of the State Council, attended and 
cut the ribbon at a celebration held at the Daya Bay Nuclear 
Power Plant this morning. In the evening of 5 February, Premier 
Li Peng held a reception in Shenzhen. He cordially met and 
addressed those attending the celebration, including those 
responsible for the joint venture that set up the Daya Bay 
Nuclear Power Plant; Chinese and foreign suppliers and 
contractors; representatives of Chinese and foreign experts; and 
French and British diplomats in China. He pointed out: The Daya 
Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a result of reform and opening up, 
and has been a beneficial experiment in establishing a modern 
enterprise system. 
  Jointly funded and constructed by the Guangdong Nuclear 
Power 
Investment Company Limited and the Hong Kong Nuclear Power 
Investment Company Limited, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is 
a large nuclear power plant with two pressurized water reactors 
capable of generating 900,000 kilowatts. The reactors were 
imported from France and Britain. Construction of the plant 
began in early 1984 and civil engineering and construction 
projects for various key buildings were essentially completed at 
the end of 1990. The No. 1 Generating Unit formally began 
commercial operations on 1 February. The No. 2 Generating Unit 
of the plant is expected to commence commercial operations this 
year. Once fully complete, the nuclear power plant will 
generate more than 10 billion kwh of electricity annually, and 
will play an active role in helping economic progress and 
prosperity in Guangdong and Hong Kong. 
  Li Peng said at the reception: The commercial operation of 
the No. 1 generating unit of the power plant marks a new step 
for China in the development of its nuclear power industry. The 
Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant is China's first medium-scale 
nuclear power plant which was researched, designed, 
manufactured, and built by China itself. The Daya Bay Nuclear 
Power Plant is China's first large nuclear power plant built 
with foreign funds and advanced equipment and technology. The 
construction of both nuclear plants has important significance 
for China as it starts to develop its nuclear power industry, 
cultivate its technological personnel, and master nuclear power 
technology. 
  Li Peng said: The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a result 
of reform and opening up. As early as 1979, when China had just 
begun to implement its policy of reform and opening up, the 
Power Industry Ministry Industry and Guangdong Province proposed 
the idea of taking advantage of Shenzhen's favorable 
geographical location to attract foreign capital, construct a 
plant with loans, and repay the loans by selling electricity, 
thereby blazing a new path for China in the use of foreign funds 
and the development of large infrastructural projects. The Daya 
Bay Nuclear Plant was China's largest Sino- foreign 
joint-venture enterprise set up in the early period of reform 
and opening up. In accordance with international normal 
practice, the plant has established a modern enterprise 
management system and enforces a responsibility system whereby 
the general manager is under the guidance of a board of 
directors. The plant has, therefore, separated government from 
enterprise functions, and has instituted specific 
responsibilities and a scientific management system. In the 
course of constructing the power plant, it has introduced 
competitive mechanisms, and has adopted a system of attracting 
and accepting public tenders whereby it chose outstanding 
Chinese and foreign suppliers and construction enterprises to 
join in various endeavors including design, construction, 
experimentation, and consultation. The commendable aspects of 
the construction of Daya Bay Nuclear Plant are not only that 
China has imported advanced foreign equipment and technology, 
but it has also gained from advanced foreign experience in 
organizing and managing construction projects, thereby 
considerably raising its standards of modern construction. 
  Li Peng said: The party central committee and the State 
Council have been paying attention to and supporting the Daya 
Bay Nuclear Power Plant project. The State Council has held 
many meetings to expound and demonstrate the necessity of the 
project. When the joint-venture agreement was signed by the 
Guangdong Nuclear Power Investment Company Limited in 1985, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping personally met Lord Kadoorie, founder of 
the Hong Kong Nuclear Power Investment Company Limited and 
former chairman of Hong Kong's China Light and Power Company, 
thereby fully endorsing his approval and support for the new 
project, which arose from reform and opening up. Comrade Jiang 
Zemin has been very concerned with the work at the nuclear power 
plant: He personally visited and gave instructions at the work 
site. During crucial moments when the project was under 
construction, many leading comrades of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council involved themselves personally 
and resolved problems as they occurred in an effort to help the 
project progress smoothly. Localities and departments -- 
including the Power Industry Ministry, the China National 
Nuclear Corporation, Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen city -- 
have done a lot of work to help construction of the nuclear 
power plant, have created various conditions, and have provided 
effective support in various aspects. The plant is also a 
product of the constructive efforts of both the central and 
local governments. 
  Li Peng expressed his hope: Chinese and foreign suppliers 
and contractors, as well as Chinese and foreign personnel at the 
work site, should continue to make efforts and contribute to 
finishing the whole nuclear power plant project comprehensively 
and efficiently. Not only should we properly construct the new 
nuclear power plant, but we should also manage it properly. In 
a sense, it is more difficult to manage a nuclear power plant 
properly than to build it properly. Therefore, when operating 
the power plant in the future, all personnel must persistently 
pursue the principle of "quality and safety first" to ensure 
that electricity is safely, efficiently, and continuously 
generated and supplied to Guangdong and Hong Kong and so 
promotes economic prosperity in the region. 
  Li Peng said: China needs a lot of electricity. While 
vigorously developing thermal and hydroelectric power stations, 
we should also appropriately develop nuclear power plants as 
local conditions demand. The construction of the Daya Bay 
Nuclear Power Plant has generated successful experience on which 
the development of China's nuclear power industry can be based, 
and has trained a large number of specialist nuclear power 
professionals. Meanwhile, it has also created favorable 
conditions for the development of the second-phase construction 
project at Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant. At present, China is 
comprehensively implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, it is deepening reform and opening wider to 
the outside world. Foreign investors have been very 
enthusiastic about investing in China. China has continually 
improved its investment environment and has further widened the 
scope for new investment. We welcome foreign investors to join 
us in developing China's basic industries and infrastructural 
facilities and warmly invite friends from various countries to 
carry out further economic and technological cooperation with 
China. 
  Leading comrades attending the celebration and the reception 
were Ding Guangen, Zou Jiahua, and Xie Fei; and also responsible 
persons from relevant departments of the State Council, from 
Guangdong Province, and from the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong 
branch. 
  Also invited to attend the celebration and reception were 
the 
French and British ambassadors to China; and responsible persons 
from enterprises including Hong Kong's China Light and Power 
Company, the Hong Kong Nuclear Power Investment Company Limited, 
the French Power Company, the French Framatome Corporation, the 
French and British General Electric Alsthom Corporation, and the 
British General Electric Company.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Su Hung-ju (5685 7703 0320): "Premier Li </F>
Peng Delivered Speech at Inauguration Ceremony of Daya Bay 
Nuclear Power Plant (Full Text)"] 
  [Text] Shenzhen, 6 Feb (WEN WEI PO)--At the inauguration 
ceremony of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, State Council 
Premier Li Peng delivered a speech entitled "Daya Bay Nuclear 
Power Plant is a Product of Reform and Opening, a Useful Trial 
of the Modern Enterprise System." The full text of the speech 
is as follows: 
  Ladies, gentlemen, friends, and comrades: 
  Thw Number 1 generator set of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Plant officially started its commercial operation on 1 February 
1994. Today, we gladly gather together to celebrate the 
completion of Number 1 generator set. First of all, on behalf 
of the State Council, I would like to express warm 
congratulations and sincere gratitude to the friends of China 
Light &amp; Power Co. in Hong Kong who have been sincerely 
cooperating for many years, to the domestic and overseas 
suppliers and contract undertakers participating in the 
construction of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, to the Chinese 
and foreign experts and workers working hard day and night on 
the construction site, and to all friends and comrades who 
supported and cared about this construction project! 
  The beginning of the commercial operation of Number 1 
generator set in the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant indicates that 
the nuclear power industry in our country had taken a new step. 
The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant is the first medium-sized 
nuclear power plant built in our country on the basis of our own 
researches and with our own designs and equipment made in China, 
while the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is the first large-sized 
nuclear power plant we built by introducing foreign funds and 
advanced equipment and technology. The construction of these two 
nuclear power plants play an important role in starting our 
country's nuclear power industry, training the technical 
contingent, and mastering nuclear power technology. 
  The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a product of reform and 
opening up. In 1979, shortly after our country adopted the 
reform and opening up policy, the Ministry of Power Industry and 
Guangdong Province worked out the plan for using foreign loans 
to build a power plant and then selling electricity to repay 
debts by making use of the favorable geographical conditions of 
Shenzhen, thus opening up a new road of using foreign funds to 
launch a large-scale infrastructural project in our country. 
The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is the largest Chinese-foreign 
joint venture to be set up in our country recently. A modern 
enterprise management system was set up according to 
international practice, with the adoption of the general manager 
responsibility system under the leadership of the board of 
directors. Thus, enterprise operation was separated from 
government functions; responsibilities were clearly defined and 
assigned; and management was effected scientifically. In the 
process of building the nuclear power plant, the competition 
mechanism was introduced, and the tender invitation system was 
adopted. Thus, the outstanding Chinese and foreign suppliers 
and construction enterprises were selected to participate in the 
power plant's design, construction, testing, and consulting 
services. The valuable point of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Plant is not only the introduction of advanced foreign equipment 
and technology but also the adoption of the advanced foreign 
experience in organizing and managing a construction project, 
thus substantially enhancing our own level of modern 
construction. 
  The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a project always cared 
about and supported by the party central leadership and the 
State Council. The State Council held many meetings to discuss 
and assess this project. In 1985, when the joint venture 
contract of Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation was signed, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping personally received Lord Kadoorie, the 
joint venture's Hong Kong-side founder and chairman of China 
Light &amp; Power Co., and expressed full affirmation and support 
for this new product of reform and opening up. Comrade Jiang 
Zemin was also deeply concerned about the nuclear power plant 
work and personally came to the site to give instructions. At 
crucial junctures, the central leading comrades personally 
attended to the project, which helped overcome difficulties in 
the process of construction and ensured the smooth development 
of the project. The Ministry of Power Industry, the Nuclear 
Industrial Corporation, Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen City 
also did a great deal of work to create conditions for the 
construction of the nuclear power plant, and gave effective 
support to the project. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is 
also a product of the policy for giving play to the initiative 
of both the central and local authorities. It should be pointed 
out that the French company, Famatong [3127 7456 6639], which 
supplied the nuclear- island equipment for the Daya Bay Nuclear 
Power Plant, the British company, General Power [tong yong dian 
qi 6639 3938 7193 3049], which supplied the conventional 
generator set, and the French Electric Power Company, which 
undertook the contracts of designing and testing the equipment, 
carried out effective cooperation with the Chinese design, 
construction, and testing institutions in the prolonged process 
of construction. We express heartfelt gratitude and respect for 
their cooperation. 
  At present, number one generator set of the Daya Bay 
Nuclear Power Plant has been put into commercial operation, and 
the testing of number two generator set is going on smoothly. 
The whole project is expected to be completed and put into 
operation within this year. It is hoped that the Chinese and 
foreign suppliers, contract undertakers, and all Chinese and 
foreign personnel on the construction side will, as usual, 
continue their efforts and continue to make contributions to the 
full completion of the nuclear power plant project in good 
quality and with high efficiency. We shall not only properly 
build such a modern nuclear power plant, but will also properly 
manage it. In a certain sense, it is even more difficult to 
manage it well than to build it well. Therefore, in the future 
operation of the nuclear power plant, the entire personnel must 
always carry out the principle of "quality first, safety first," 
and perfectly ensure that electric power is unceasingly 
generated and supplied in a safe way and in good quality to 
Guangdong Province and the Hong Kong region, thus serving the 
economic prosperity in these areas. 
  Our country has a great demand for electric power, so when 
making great effort to develop thermal power and hydropower 
generation, we also need to appropriately develop nuclear power 
generation in suitable locations. The construction of the Daya 
Bay Nuclear Power Plant has provided successful experience for 
the development of the nuclear power industry in our country, 
and has also trained a large number of nuclear power experts. 
At the same time, favorable conditions for the second-phase 
project in the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant have also been 
created. At present, our nation is further comprehensively 
carrying out the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and 
is deepening the reforms and expanding opening. Foreign 
investment in China also keeps an upward momentum, as the 
investment environment is being continuously improved and the 
scope of investment is being broadened further. We welcome 
foreign companies to participate in our construction projects in 
the basic industries and in the field of infrastructural 
facilities, and warmly welcome friends from various countries to 
further the economic and technical cooperation in the field of 
nuclear power generation. 
  Now, I propose a toast to the completion and commercial 
operation of Number 1 generator set of the Daya Bay Nuclear 
Power Plant, to the friendly cooperation of Chinese and foreign 
constructors, and to our friendship! 
  Thank you very much! 
  5 February 1994

  [Text] Zhuhai, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng has recently re-visited the Juren (Giant) Group in Zhuhai 
city in Guangdong Province on his way to cut the ribbon for the 
commercial operation of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant. 
  The group, set up two years ago, is engaged in computer 
science, and has developed a dozen new products, including a 
computer worked by writing instead of by a keyboard. 
  It invested 50 million yuan in the construction of a 
software 
development center, the largest in the country. 
  The number of subsidiaries has grown from eight in 1992 to 
38 
in 1993. 
  Last year, its sale value reached 360 million yuan and its 
profits and taxes totalled 46 million yuan, respectively up by 
125 percent and 31 percent over the previous year. 
  Premier Li Peng visited the group on January 6, 1993. He 
showed great interest in the research and development of the 
software for the computer worked by handwriting. 
  He asked Shi Yuzhu, general manager of the group, to send a 
telegram if they succeed in the research. 
  In August 1993, Shi sent a telegram to the premier telling 
him that their research program had passed the technological 
test sponsored by Guangdong Province. 
  When Li Peng was at the company on February 2, Shi told the 
premier that his group was now working on a new software program 
for translating Chinese into English and vice versa. 
  The premier expressed his best wishes for the success of the 
group. 
  During his visit, Li Peng also talked with employees of the 
group and had a group photo taken with them.

  [Text] Beijing, 6 Feb (WEN WEI PO)--When discussing the 
issue of public security recently, State Council Premier Li Peng 
stressed: We must wipe out triad society whenever we find it and 
we should never allow triad society to grow in socialist China. 
  Authoritative sources cited Li Peng's speech at the national 
work meeting on politics and law: The central authorities are 
urging the departments of politics and law to study the history 
and conditions of the formation of triad society inside and 
outside China and to move to fight against it. Triad society is 
a major force of disruption -- not only does it constitute an 
element hostile to social order on its own but it will also be 
able to collude with other hostile elements in the future. We 
must mobilize all social forces to nip every kind of triad 
society in the bud.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Man-no (3769 2581 1226): "It Is Said That </F>
Deng Xiaoping Will Pass Lunar New Year in Zhuhai"] 
  [Text] An informed source in Zhuhai told this reporter 
that mainland China's supreme leader Deng Xiaoping is planning a 
trip to Zhuhai on the eve of the Spring Festival and planning to 
pass the Lunar New Year there. State Council Premier Li Peng 
has just had a vacation in Zhuhai and took the opportunity to 
inspect some large capital construction projects there. 
  The informed source revealed that State Council Premier Li 
Peng's current southern tour is basically a winter vacation, and 
he is to carry out an inspection tour of the developing urban 
economy of the Zhu Jiang Delta in Guangdong in passing. Li Peng 
spent seven days in Zhuhai this time, the longest stay in a 
single place in his southern tour itinerary. While vacationing, 
he visited some large capital construction projects in Zhuhai. 
Endorsing Zhuhai's plan to build the Lingdingyang Bridge, which 
will link the city with Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Li Peng urged 
Zhuhai to speed up the construction of the project. 
  The informed source said several central leaders will take 
vacations in Zhuhai this year since it is quite cold in Beijing 
during winter. As the weather is fine in Zhuhai, the city is 
clean, and traffic and personnel control is easy here as a 
special economic zone, apart from Li Peng, who has just left 
Zhuhai after vacationing, Deng Xiaoping will also come to Zhuhai 
on the eve of the Spring Festival to pass the Lunar New Year 
here, and then return to Beijing after the Spring Festival.

and are ready to entertain Deng Xiaoping, even though Zhuhai 
Mayor Liang Guangda yesterday refused to confirm this 
newspaper's exclusive report that Deng Xiaoping was coming to 
Zhuhai to pass the lunar New Year. 
  During his southern tour in January of the year before last, 
Deng Xiaoping inspected Zhuhai and Shenzhen and made some 
important remarks, stressing that it was necessary for mainland 
China to continue with reform and opening up and develop its 
economy. Later, this brought about a nationwide tide of 
economic reform. 
  Although Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda refused to confirm to 
this reporter in Zhuhai yesterday the report on Deng Xiaoping's 
plan to visit south China during the lunar New Year, he said 
that it would certainly be a blessing to reform, opening up, and 
economic development as a whole if Deng Xiaoping really does 
come. 
  In the meantime, Liang noted that several central leaders 
endorsed Zhuhai's development experience during their recent 
inspection tours of Zhuhai.

  [Text] Fuzhou, February 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji said the Haicang Investment Zone in Xiamen, Fujian 
Province, is now ready for all-round development. 
  During an inspection of the provincial capital of Fuzhou and 
Xiamen city from February 3 to 5, Zhu said the zone has made 
great progress in infrastructure construction since 1992. 
  "This has laid a sound foundation for the zone's future 
development and construction, as well as for Xiamen's further 
development," he told local officials. 
  As a pioneer in opening to the outside world, Fujian 
Province 
has undergone great changes and scored tremendous achievements 
in reforms and economic growth, he said. 
  While visiting the Taijiang farmers' market in Fuzhou, he 
praised Fujian Province for paying heed to the farming sector 
and vegetable production. 
  Prices have slipped back as a result of plentiful supplies 
of 
non-staple food, especially vegetables, to the satisfaction of 
consumers, he said. 
  "I think this will help create a relaxed environment for 
reforms and economic expansion in Fujian this year," said Zhu, 
who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau 
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee. 
  As a result of the taxation reform begun this year, about 28 
percent of state-owned businesses have shouldered a slightly 
heavier tax burden, he told local government officials and 
business executives. 
  He also expressed the hope that these businesses will 
further 
improve management, cut back on expenses and lower production 
costs, rather than raise prices of their products. 
  While visiting the Haicang Investment Zone, the vice-premier 
extended Spring Festival greetings to all workers at 
construction sites. 
  Speaking of the zone's development in the next phase, he 
called for faster construction of a power plant, a coal terminal 
and other facilities and for efforts to further improve the 
investment environment.

<F P=106> [By special reporter Huang Jo-hung (7806 5387 4767): "Zhu </F>
Rongji Winds up Inspection Tour in Haicang, Xiamen"] 
  [Text] Xiamen, 5 Feb (WEN WEI PO) -- The senior officials 
of relevant departments of the State Council led by Zhu Rongji, 
member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Political Bureau and 
vice premier of the State Council, ended their two-day 
inspection activities in Xiamen and left the city this 
afternoon. The vice premier fully affirmed the achievements 
made in the Haicang Investment Zone's development and in the 
economic work of Xiamen. He stressed: It is necessary to handle 
the relationship between reform and stability well. The central 
authorities have urged grasping opportunity, deepening reform, 
opening wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability 
[zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, kuoda kaifang, cujin fazhan, 
baochi wending 2119 0145 2623 6657, 3234 0553 2395 7245, 2368 
1129 7030 2397, 0191 6651 4099 1455, 0202 2170 4489 1353]. This 
constitutes the overall situation, and leaders at all levels 
must take it into account and safeguard it. 
  Among those who accompanied Vice Premier Zu Rongji in 
inspecting Xiamen were He Chunlin, deputy secretary general of 
the State Council; Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning 
Commission; Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Commission for 
Restructuring Economy; Gu Xiulian, minister of chemical 
industry; Yu Zhen, chairman of the China Light Industry 
Federation; Dai Xianglong, vice president of the People's Bank 
of China; Li Yanling, vice minister of finance; and Li Yizhong, 
vice president of the China National Petrochemical Corporation. 
Leaders of Fujian Province and relevant departments -- such as 
Jia Qinglin, secretary of the provincial party committee and 
concurrently governor, and Wang Jianshuang, member of the 
standing committee of the provincial party committee and vice 
governor -- accompanied the vice premier on his inspection tour. 
  During his stay in Xiamen, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and his 
party went to Haicang to inspect the investment zone there in a 
selective way. The vice premier visited Haicang in March and 
July of 1992. During the current visit, he selectively inspected 
the projects under construction in the Haicang Investment Zone, 
such as the Gaoyu power station, the Xianglu polyester fiber 
textile project, the Xinyang industrial park, Haicang's new 
urban districts, the Haicang management committee, and the 
construction of infrastructure in Haicang. He listened to 
reports submitted by leaders of the management committee. Fully 
affirming the construction and development of the Haicang 
Investment Zone, the vice premier said: Compared with 1992, 
Haicang has undergone very great changes and has roughly met the 
need for infrastructure, including water and electricity 
supplies, roads, and telecommunications. Haicang already has 
had the conditions for large-scale construction and development. 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and his party also listened to the 
report submitted by Xiamen Mayor Hong Yongshi on his city's 
economic development last year, and had a discussion with 
leaders of relevant provincial and city departments on the 
question of tax reform. Fully affirming Xiamen's economic work, 
the vice premier said: I am very pleased that Xiamen's economy 
has developed rapidly and that the city has achieved very good 
results in its work. 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out: In 1994, we will 
continue to implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as the spirit of 
the 14th CPC Congress and the Third Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee. Located along the coast, Fujian Province and 
Xiamen have the conditions for somewhat more rapid development. 
However, the rapid development we are discussing here means 
rapid development with efficiency. We must seek rapid 
development in line with the spirit of General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin's speeches. The vice premier also stressed: In 
considering problems, we must emancipate our minds and seek 
truth from facts. With encouragement, he said: The Xiamen 
Special Economic Zone has enormous strong points and a 
foundation for construction. Moreover, it is "small, but 
effective, and so has boundless prospects." 
  According to an analysis, in the days to come, Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji will show more substantial concern for Haicang's 
further development and construction.

  [Text] Dear listeners: The Eighth Chinese National 
People's Congress [NPC] will hold its second full session in 
Beijing next March. To prepare for the session, some 120 
deputies from Beijing and Tianjin began a 10-day inspection tour 
of Beijing Municipality on 19 January. During their inspection 
tour, the deputies gave their views and made many suggestions on 
various aspects of Beijing's urban construction, economic 
development, and social life. 
  The Beijing municipal government held a forum on 28 January, 
where principal municipal leaders heard the deputies' views and 
suggestions. 
  Qu Geping, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee 
Environmental Protection Committee, spoke about Beijing's urban 
plans and environmental protection. He said: Beijing is 
China's capital; it is also suffering from a water shortage. In 
drawing up urban industrial development plans, anything that 
affects water resources and the air should be restricted, not 
only in the city proper but also in surburban districts and 
counties. After more than a decade of readjustment, enterprises 
with serious pollution problems have been moved out of the city. 
The municipal government has also adopted measures to reduce 
pollution, such as developing centralized heating and natural 
gas supply systems. However, there are still a few factories 
producing pollution in the city proper. 
  Qu Geping pointed out that the NPC is considering revising 
relevant laws and regulations to ban the use of raw coal, which 
produces heavy pollutants. He urged the municipality to take 
the lead in this regard. 
  Many deputies also spoke about commodity prices, an issue of 
great concern to ordinary Chinese citizens. Qin Zhongda, member 
of the NPC Standing Committee, said: Municipal leaders have 
been personally attending to work related to the supply of 
grain, edible oil, and other foodstuff. Departments responsible 
for commodity prices have also done a tremendous amount of work. 
With the approaching of the Spring Festival, a traditional 
Chinese holiday, the government has indicated that prices will 
be controlled during the holiday season. What will happen after 
the holiday season? He expressed confidence in the government 
to do a good job in this regard, but he also urged it to keep 
the size of price increases under control for a protracted 
period. 
  Other deputies also gave their views on issues of science 
and 
technology, education, and reduction of the peasants' burden. 
  At the forum, Chen Xitong, responsible person of the 
municipal government, thanked the deputies for giving their 
views and making suggestions. In response to the questions 
raised and criticism made by the deputies, he said: The 
municipal government will seriously study solutions and will see 
to it that everyone of the questions is answered. Taking the 
questions raised by the deputies seriously in order to resolve 
them is an important expression of socialist democracy.

  [Text] Beijing, 31 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- An article 
in the 87th edition of ZHONGHUA YINGCAI [CHINESE TALENT] 
bimonthly, due out tomorrow, reveals for the first time the life 
story and family background of Wu Jianmin, the ninth spokesman 
of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  Born in 1939 in Chongqing, Sichuan, Wu was the son of a 
driver. He moved to Nanjing with the family. His mother was a 
housewife all her life, raising all of her eight children with 
her own hands. 
  After graduating from Nanjing No. 2 secondary school in 
1955, 
Wu enrolled in the French Department of the Beijing Institute of 
Foreign Languages, and was sent to Budapest by the Communist 
Youth League Central Committee in 1961 as a French interpreter 
for China's resident delegates at the World Youth Federation of 
Democracy. He returned to the country in 1965. 
  Wu Jianmin spent one third of his more than 30-year 
diplomatic career at the UN Headquarters in New York. Twice he 
worked with China's permanent UN delegation, first in the early 
seventies as the official in charge of the Middle East and 
southern Africa affairs. During this period he was promoted from 
3d secretary to 2d secretary. When the UN Assembly was in 
session, Wu would represent China in various political panel 
discussions. The second time was in the mid eighties, when he 
worked as a political affairs attache. 
  In 1979, Wu Jianmin was transferred to the Chinese People's 
Institute of Foreign Affairs to take charge of its European 
affairs. His main duty, however, was in protocol work. Four 
years later he returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to 
work at its political studies section. 
  His first "exposure" to the world occurred on 21 March 1991 
at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs' routine weekly press 
conference at the Beijing International Club. In the ensuing 
two and a half years, until 21 October 1993, he presided over 
122 press conferences. 
  Wu said being a spokesman was a "most challenging job." 
"Each time he felt the enormous weight of responsibility," "for 
sitting there on the podium represents the interests of our 
country and countrymen." That is why each time he was "very 
careful and serious, as if walking on thin ice..." People close 
to Wu from the diplomatic circles described him as being able to 
conduct himself very well at live press conferences, quick in 
mind, and fast in reaction. Many foreign reporters give him a 
thumbs-up for his brilliant performance. But Wu said: "I have 
never been totally satisfied with any of my press conferences. 
I always feel there is something to improve on." 
  Shi Yanhua, Wu Jianmin's wife, is now head of the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry Translation Department. She graduated from the 
English Department of the Beijing Institute of Foreign Languages 
and was assigned to work at the Foreign Affairs Ministry 
Education Office. In her 15-year career as a translator, Shi 
participated in many party and state leaders' meetings with 
foreign guests, and attended many important international 
conferences as a member of the entourages of Deng Xiaoping, Li 
Xiannian, and others during their visits. From the late 
seventies and early eighties, Shi was the translator for Deng 
Xiaoping in all his meetings with U.S. officials and political 
leaders. 
  Wu Jianmin and Shi Yanhua have a daughter, who graduated 
from 
the Beijing Economics and Trade University and is working.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "Local Government Reforms Planned"] </F>
  [Text] A pilot project for local government reform in the 
countryside is planned by the government. 
  Some 13 counties will take part in the first stage, 
according 
to official sources. 
  And a restructured social security system will be set up for 
farmers. 
  The pilot scheme will make the selected county 
administrations responsible for reforming the ways the State 
property rights are used. 
  It is hoped the project will eventually extend to the more 
than 2,000 counties in China, said the official from the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economic System (SCRES). 
"Enterprises run by local authorities will be required to go 
further than large and medium-sized State firm so far have in 
the opening up of property rights," the official said. 
  A working committee will be established to guide the reform 
of the pilot project counties. It will consist of SCRES and 
provincial and prefecture government officials. 
  If the county reforms are successful, they will provide a 
working model for the larger and more intractable rural and 
urban administrations. 
  Restrictions on the transfer of ownership will have to be 
abolished by the pilot counties. And State, collective and 
private enterprises will be encouraged to work together to 
develop industry and commerce in the pilot areas. 
  The counties to be chosen all have economic reform 
experience. 
  The working committee overseeing the project will provide 
specialist advice and help solve problems emerging from the 
local reforms. 
  But local leaders will have to provide much of the impetus 
themselves, the commission said. 
  The project's success will depend upon sound administration 
and economic development across the pilot areas. And the 
different counties will have to map out their own reform plans 
in line with local conditions and not blindly imitate others. 
  About 350 counties have previously been chosen by provincial 
governments across the country to take part in pilot reforms. 
  There are about 2,100 counties in China and one third of 
them 
are seen as "poverty counties".

  [Text] A human rights group says China has sentenced 11 
Tibetan Buddhist nuns to between two and seven years in prison. 
Amnesty International says the nuns were arrested last June and 
jailed for allegedly taking part in an anti-Chinese 
demonstration. 
  Amnesty urged concerned people to write to the Tibetan 
Regional Government, asking for clarification of the case. Last 
month, another human rights group, the Tibet Information 
Network, said the Chinese authorities had stepped efforts to 
halt political activism among Buddhist nuns.
