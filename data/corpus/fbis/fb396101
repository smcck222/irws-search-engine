<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Local Areas Given More Taxing Power"] </F>
  [Text] China abolished five old tax items yesterday to 
smooth the way for its new and simplified tax system. 
  The State Council, China's cabinet also decided to delegate 
more power to local governments for taxing animal slaughter and 
banquets. 
  The five obsolete items had covered trade fairs, livestock 
trading, salary adjustments, bonuses and oil burning. 
  China introduced the bonus tax in the early 1980s to prevent 
inflation. 
  The country's economy at that time was just lifting from a 
decade-long low, and enterprises were paying more to their 
employees because of improved efficiencies. 
  In particular, managers of State run enterprises, who were 
able to control their ventures for a designated period of time 
on a contractual basis, tried to win the support of employees by 
lining their wallets. 
  Caught off guard by the freewheeling bonus-giving, the State 
Council created the bonus tax on enterprises in 1984. 
  The provision stipulated that a State-run industrial or 
commercial enterprise was subject to taxation if its annual 
bonuses to employees exceeded an amount equal to their standard 
salaries for two and a half months. 
  The bonus tax rate could be as high as 300 per cent. 
  The tax successfully curbed the practice of raising bonus 
levels, thereby easing the country's inflationary pressures. 
But that was only one side of the coin. The bonus tax also 
hampered a quick increase of individual incomes in China. 
  The new individual income tax law took effect at the 
beginning of this year, replacing the old bonus (and salary 
adjustment) tax. 
  Under the new system, enterprises find it easier to raise 
the 
employees' income levels. However now the individuals, not the 
units must pay the tax for their extra income, including bonuses. 
  The emphasis on individual rights and obligations comes 
closer to international practice and effectively relieves the 
enterprises' burden, while steering away from possible 
inflationary hikes. 
  Chinese individuals are now liable for taxation if their 
monthly income (including bonuses) surpasses 800 yuan ($92). 
  The ceiling will be higher for taxable foreigners, but the 
amount is still to be decided by the State Council. 
  Economists said the structural reform of China's tax system 
will not cause a heavier burden on tax payers. 
  China will tax only 18 items, compared with more than 30 in 
the past decades. 
  Yesterday's announcement reflects the State's consideration 
to strike a virtual balance between the revenues of central and 
local governments.

Central Policymaker Reiterates Strict Control Over Capital 
Construction Scale To Prevent Economy From Overheating"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Feb -- According to an authoritative 
source here, in a speech several days ago, a central policymaker 
again raised the issue of preventing the economy from 
overheating and of strictly controlling the scale of capital 
construction. Under the present conditions, formulations raised 
by the localities, such as "above the norm" and "in a big way" 
[da shou bi 1129 2087 4581], do not conform with Deng Xiaoping's 
idea of economic development. 
  The source said: The central policy maker explicitly pointed 
out: It is bow inadvisable to raise the slogan of "quickening 
the pace of reform and accelerating economic growth" because the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has put 
forward a series of major reform measures. The crucial issue 
now is to implement them rather than put forward new reform 
measures. On the issue of development speed, the Chinese 
economy has registered high-speed growth for several years in a 
row. On the basis of an annual growth of 13 percent, it is not 
geared to actual circumstances to raise again the idea of 
accelerating development. 
  In the central policymaker's view, the formulation of the 
central authorities on economic growth is sustained, high-speed, 
and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang 2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 
1660] development. We should not look only at the word 
"high-speed" in the middle without regard for the others at both 
ends. In studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea, we should not 
merely apply the words accelerating development without 
comprehensively and correctly understanding the idea as a whole. 
Therefore, the central authorities call on all localities not 
to deviate from the major principles and policies laid down by 
the central authorities and engage in their own "above the norm" 
projects or carry them out "in a big way." Nor should they 
blindly compete in speed. Provided that they conscientiously 
implement the reform measures put forward by the central 
authorities, the Chinese economy can follow a normal track.

<F P=106> [Article by Jiang Yaping: "Five Years of China's Bankruptcy </F>
Law: Problems and Prospects"] 
  [Text] "During the past five years the Bankruptcy Law has 
been playing an increasingly important role in pushing forward 
the market-oriented reforms in China, and it has not been a 
smooth process," Cao Siyuan, initiator of the law, said at a 
meeting on the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the People's 
Republic of China (for Trial Implementation) which was created 
in December 1986 and went into effect on November 1, 1988. 
Economists, entrepreneurs and professors participated in the 
meeting held here in Beijing. 
  Cao Siyuan, who was the first to call for the introduction 
of 
the Bankruptcy Law and participated throughout in the process of 
its drafting, said, "During the period, people's courts at 
various levels have tried nearly 1,000 bankruptcy cases with 
more than 400 bankruptcies officially declared. This law has 
particular significance in the market economy as it can help 
enterprises adapt to the market and accelerate the establishment 
of a market-oriented economy in China." 
  According to Cao, there were nearly 100 bankruptcy cases 
heard by the courts from late 1988 to early 1989, but the number 
dropped to 32 in the following 12 months. However, in the past 
few years, with the changes in the economy and business 
practices, many enterprises that incurred losses and fell into 
debt turned to the Bankruptcy Law to protect their legal rights 
and interests. 
  There were only 117 bankruptcy cases in 1991, but as many 
428 
in 1992. The past four years has witnessed a total of 675 
bankruptcy cases. In the first half of 1993, another 273 
bankruptcy cases were tried. 
  "This is not a large number compared with the Western 
countries, which see thousands of companies going bankrupt each 
month. But it is still a significant number for China, a 
socialist country which is just starting to run a 
market-oriented economy," Cao said. 
  Statistics show that around one-third of state-owned 
enterprises are losing money due to poor management or for other 
reasons. This is a heavy burden for the government as it has to 
subsidize these deficit-ridden enterprises with huge sums of 
money merely to keep them in operation, even though they may 
incur further losses. 
  Yang Kewen, Director of Beijing Industrial Adjustment 
Association, revealed that 40 percent of state-owned enterprises 
in Beijing operated at a loss in the last three quarters of 
1993, compared with 33.6 percent in the same period in 1992. 
"Many of these enterprises should be declared bankrupt to stop 
further losses. But only a few of them have done so," he said. 
  In China, the word "bankruptcy" carries such negative 
connotations that many people, including factory directors and 
government officials, have a preconceived negative attitude 
towards it. As a result, many businesses refuse to declare 
bankruptcy. 
  Bian Jingzhai, Law Department Director of the All China 
Federation of Trade Union, said that the law, good as it is, 
will be hard to implement if auxiliary measures are not taken to 
help enforce it. "When an enterprise is declared bankrupt, the 
workers are out of a job, but the directors and mangers, who are 
supposed to assume responsibility for the losses, are more often 
than not shifted to other leading posts. Is this fair?" he said. 
  Bian also mentioned that even some senior engineers are 
forced to take low pay and engaged in manual work after their 
enterprises are shut down. Who is going to hire laid-off 
workers in this tense and competitive market? It is 
understandable that most workers oppose declaring bankruptcy 
even though their enterprises are losing money and debt-ridden. 
He also called for the setting up of labor markets to find 
jobs for laid-off workers. 
  Experts have called for the creation of a Labor Law, 
Corporate Law, Enterprise Merger Law and law to insure the 
unemployed and retired, guarantee their basic living standards 
and protect their rights. 
  "I hope that in five years the Bankruptcy Law can be 
repromulgated with no restrictions or conditions and not on a 
trial basis," Cao said. The following are the amendments to 
the law proposed by the economists: 
  -- The law should cover all enterprises, not just the 
state-owned ones, as more and more collectively and 
privately-owned enterprises, and even Chinese foreign joint 
ventures, will be involved in bankruptcy cases. 
  -- The conditions of the Bankruptcy Law should be clear and 
specific, so the words in Article Three of Chapter One 
"enterprises which, owing to poor operations and management that 
result in serious losses, are unable to repay the debts that are 
due shall be declared bankrupt" are amended as follows: 
"Enterprises unable to pay debts that are due shall be declared 
bankrupt." 
  -- The amount of time needed for applications and the 
hearing 
of bankruptcy cases, which can extend to more than half a year 
in accordance with the provision of the law, should be shortened 
so as to enhance efficiency and reduce the losses of both 
debtors and creditors. 
  -- The formation of a liquidation team should be undertaken 
according to market principles, namely, the leader of the 
liquidation team should be chosen and appointed by the people's 
court from among the experts working in firms that do bankruptcy 
consultation, law firms and accountancy firms, and not from 
government officials. The members of the liquidation team 
should be hired by the team leader and approved by the court. 
  According to the decision made at the just concluded Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of CPC, the 
government will try to turn some state-owned enterprises into 
limited liability companies which must shoulder responsibility 
for their profits or losses, relieving the state of financial 
responsibility for the business. 
  "Under such circumstance, tens of thousands of debt-ridden, 
long-term loss-making enterprises in China are expected to apply 
for bankruptcy. That will make our business very prosperous in 
the coming years," Cao said. 
  He also explained that China's rejoining the GATT and its 
integration into the international market economy will 
inevitably eliminate any obstacle and unfair measures that 
protect failing enterprises. It makes no sense, in a market 
economy, to subsidize enterprises that are losing money.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhang Xia: "Rail Crisis Cries Out for </F>
Flexible Pricing System"] 
  [Text] Current freight rates fail to reflect transport 
costs and this has hurt the rail system's development, says a 
chief economist with the Ministry of Railways. 
  "The speed of development of China's railway system, to a 
great extent, depends on its price reform," said Zhang Youmin 
adding that the slow expansion of railways is hindering the 
nation's economic growth. 
  Rail transport has long been under strict central management 
with the State shipping key materials such as coal and 
disaster-relief supplies. 
  Soon, however, railway authorities will turn 20 percent of 
their freight cars over to commercial shipping. 
  "This is the first step in price reform," Zhang said of the 
plan which leaves the other 80 percent to be used by the State 
under preferential pricing policies. 
  In future, rail transportation of planned goods including 
coal and rice will be minimized, Zhang said. The current 
freight rate, set in 1990 is unable to cover the cost of 
transporting goods. 
  The rail network was in the red last year and this year's 
deficit is expected to reach a record high of 10 billion yuan 
($1.15 billion). 
  In recent years, the government has shifted its efforts to 
build in infrastructure. The railways, however, have received 
too little funding from the limited State coffers. 
  This year, rail authorities face a shortage of 15 billion 
yuan ($1.72 billion) for planned construction projects. 
  There are only 54,000 kilometres of railway in China, or a 
per capita length shorter than a cigarette, in country with a 
land mass of 9.6 million square kilometres. 
  In contrast, India has 60,000 kilometres of railway for a 
country of 2.9 million square kilometres. And the United States 
has more than 200,000 kilometres of railway spanning 9.3 million 
square kilometres China's rail system can cope with only 68 
percent of its total freight needs. And goods transport has 
become a bottleneck in the nation's economic development. 
  East and South China often run short of coal which is 
shipped 
from stockpiles in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces and Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region in the North. 
  Zhang estimates the loss to the economy caused by rail 
gridlock a 500 billion yuan ($57.4 billion) last year. 
  China needs at least 100,000 kilometres of railway to meet 
the requirements of its economic development, Zhang said. 
  Plans call for the railways to be 60,000 kilometres long by 
the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan in 1995 and during the 
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), they are to grow to 70,000 
kilometres. 
<H5>  Collect Funds </H5>
  Various channels should be tapped to collect funds to build 
railways. 
  In Zhejiang Province, for instance a railway connecting 
Jinhua and Wenzhou is being built with funds from Taiwan. 
  However, the fact that China's railways are losing money is 
a 
stumbling block for outside investors. 
  "Only when the rail sector is profitable, can more foreign 
investment be attracted," said Zhang. "Only then, will local 
governments be enthusiastic about building railways at their own 
expenses." 
  The rail network's artificially low price system has also 
resulted in waste, said Zhang. 
  The coastal areas, where chemical industries have 
concentrated for the rich salt resources, now ship salt from 
inland areas such as Qinghai Province because local governments 
use the beaches for fish farms. 
  The profits in the breeding industry far exceed the cost of 
shifting salt from distant provinces. 
  Although this benefits local interests, the burden on the 
railway is increased. Materials such as coal which are crucial 
to the nation's economy cannot be shipped promptly. 
  Freight trains are even used as stores due to low price of 
shipping freight, said Zhang. [sentence as published] 
  Shippers often find it cost-effective to use the railways 
even though other modes of transport might be more direct and 
serve them better. 
  The current rate per kilometre for each ton of freight 
hauled 
by truck is almost 15 times that on the railways. 
  So, while the rail network is overburdened, long-distance 
trucking and shipping is underused. This applies even on the 
Chang Jiang River which has long been regarded as China's 
"golden channel." 
  Tuozitou Port was built on the Chang Jiang in Chongqing, 
Sichuan Province, to ship coal from Guizhou Province and Guangxi 
Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  Shippers, however, make a detour by rail rather than use the 
river. 
  The port has long lain idle while the Chuanqian rail line, 
connecting Sichuan with Guizhou Province, and the Xiangyu rail 
line, connecting Sichuan Province with Hunan Province, are 
running at capacity. 
  "Rail units should have more flexible pricing systems," 
Zhang 
said. The State, for example, could set "ceiling" and "floor" 
prices for the rail sector. 
  Rail units could then transport freight under contracted 
prices within State limits. 
  Shippers wanting faster service might get priority by paying 
higher prices. 
  "This will also benefit shippers," Zhang said. It now takes 
nearly one month to apply for freight trains and, as a result, 
some shippers' products fail to reach markets in time. 
  "Once a more flexible price system is adopted, shippers will 
get prompt service," said Zhang.

  [Text] Beijing, February 5 (XINHUA) -- China is drawing up 
a "rural-urban coordination employment program" to find work for 
its 130 million surplus rural laborers, the Ministry of Labor 
said today. 
  A pilot scheme of this program will be implemented this year 
in eight provinces, said Vice-Minister of Labor Zhu Jiazhen. 
  The provinces for the try-out are either populous but less 
developed inland provinces such as Sichuan and Anhui, or coastal 
provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu, which are short of labor 
because of rapid economic development, Zhu said. 
  The scheme focuses on the development of small rural 
industrial districts and rural towns -- enlarging the existing 
ones and establishing new ones -- to take in extra laborers from 
their own regions, he added. 
  The move will also narrow the gap between rural and urban 
areas, said the vice-minister. 
  Other laborers could migrate to more developed coastal 
regions, he said, noting that an inter-provincial labor 
migration plan started last year has achieved initial successes. 
  China now has 130 million surplus rural laborers, and in 
eight years the rural areas will have 70 million new laborers, 
the vice-minister said. 
  The employment program was designed by the Labor Ministry, 
the Agriculture Ministry and the State Council Development and 
Research Center.

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- The "Regulations on 
Prohibiting Public Utility Enterprises From Restricting 
Competition," [hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations"] 
which were established by the State Administration for Industry 
and Commerce based on the "PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law," 
have been promulgated for implementation. 
  Public utility enterprises refer to enterprises dealing in 
public services such as water supply, heat supply, gas supply, 
postal service, telecommunications, and transportation. 
According to the "Regulations," public utility enterprises may 
not use their advantageous positions to obstruct fair 
competition from other businesses, nor are they allowed to 
infringe upon consumers legitimate rights and interests. 
Specifically, public utility enterprises are prohibited from 
taking the following competition-restricting measures: 
  -- Demanding that their clients and consumers can only 
purchase and use relevant commodities provided by them but not 
similar commodities provided by other dealers that meet 
established technical standards; 
  -- Demanding that their clients and consumers can only 
purchase and use relevant commodities produced or sold by 
dealers designated by them but not similar commodities provided 
by other dealers that meet established technical standards; 
  -- Compelling their clients and consumers to purchase 
unnecessary commodities and accessories provided by them and 
unnecessary commodities provided by dealers designated by them; 
  -- Using commodity quality and performance inspections as a 
pretext to obstruct clients and consumers from purchasing and 
using commodities provided by other dealers that meet the 
established technical standards. 
  If a public utility enterprise commits one or more of the 
aforementioned offenses, the concerned industry and commerce 
administration department must order it to stop the practice 
and, according to the seriousness of the case, may impose a fine 
ranging from 50,000 to 200,000 yuan. If a public utility 
enterprise refuses to accept the punishment decision and 
continues its illegal practice, this constitutes a new offense 
and the enterprise in question should be more severely punished.

11.64; Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, with 11.07; and 
Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei Province, with 11.01. 
  Last year, these cities witnessed a rapid development of 
telecommunications, with a record total installation of 
telephones. 
  For example, a total of 156,000 telephones were installed in 
Beijing last year, close to the total in the period 1990-1992. 
  Now the urban areas of Beijing have over 576,000 telephones.

  [Text] Beijing, February 8 (XINHUA) -- A contract for 
cooperation in petroleum prospecting, exploration and production 
in the first sector of the south-eastern area of the Tarim Basin 
was signed here this evening between the China National 
Petroleum Corporation and five foreign oil companies. 
  Before the signing ceremony, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing 
met with representatives of the five overseas firms: the Italian 
Agip, the French Elf, the Japanese Energy Corporation, the 
Japanese Petroleum Exploration Company and Texaco of the U.S.A. 
  The contract is the second one on petroleum prospecting and 
exploration in the Tarim Basin. It is also the second one in 
China's world-wide public tendering for cooperation in 
exploiting China's land oil. 
  Under the new contract, the foreign firms will for the next 
eight years shoulder all the expenses and risks in prospecting; 
when oil and gas fields are found, the two sides will jointly 
invest in exploration and production, and share the crude oil in 
proportions laid down by the contract. 
  It is learned that since March 1 last year, when the China 
National Petroleum Corporation opened the first round of public 
tendering for the project, 68 corporations from 17 countries had

representatives to Beijing to study relevant materials. 
  The south-eastern area of the Tarim Basin open for 
cooperation consists of five sectors covered mainly by sand.

(6316 0251 0251): "Developments in the Coal Industry Over the 
Past 30 Years: From Pneumatic Drills to Comprehensive Coal 
Mining"] 
  [Text] In July 1963, The Shiyijie coal mine under the 
jurisdiction of Shanxi's Luan Mining Administration was set up 
as one of the national industrial, communications and 
transportation systems' five red banner enterprises run with 
hard work and frugality. At that time, Shiyijie had just 
"dispensed with using primitive picks to excavate coal and 
wicker baskets for miners to carry coal by crawling along the 
tunnel on all fours." With the help of pneumatic drills and 
electric carts, they had managed to "create" an output of 1.688 
tonnes per worker per shift -- a record high across China. 
  The "mechanization" of the Shiyijie coal mine was worthy of 
representing the Chinese coal industry's level of modernization 
in the early 1960's. At that time, some developed countries 
already had begun to adopt comprehensive coal mining technology, 
which integrates coal drilling, the haulage system, and shaft 
support in a single, systematic operation. In China, however, 
only some individual mines were equipped with mechanized coal 
mining equipment imported from the USSR. To Chinese miners, 
comprehensive coal mining was, beyond a doubt, a dream that 
would come true only in the remote future. 
  Shiyijie today serves very well to demonstrate the level of 
modernization in China's coal mines with its entirely new 
feature: The degree of mechanization is 100 percent, with 
comprehensive mining having replaced pneumatic drills. Last 
year, the Shiyijie coal mine, which has entered the aging 
period, continued to turn out 4.141 tonnes per worker per shift. 
  Today, modern mines like Shiyijie have spread all over 
China. 
By the end of 1992, the degree of mechanization in China's key 
coal mines had reached 72 percent, of which comprehensive mining 
equipment accounted for 40 percent, and four mines enjoyed an 
annual output of more than 2 million tonnes. The highest level 
of output exceeded 8 tonnes per worker per shift. This showed 
that the modernization level of China's coal industry was next 
only to the United States and Australia, and had come to the 
fore. It is noteworthy that all such comprehensive mining 
equipment was made in China, and that it has been exported to 
the United States. 
  Of course, the task is still heavy and the road ahead 
remains 
a long one for the modernization of China's coal industry. The 
degree of modernization in local state-owned mines, which 
account for 17 percent of China's total coal output, remains at 
25 percent as of today, whereas the degree of mechanization of 
many town and township coal mines, the output of which is equal 
to that of key state-owned coal mines, has reached the degree of 
mechanization the Shiyijie coal mine achieved 30 years ago. In 
1993, China's coal output was 1.14 billion tonnes; the industry 
had 7 million workers and staffers; and the efficiency rate was 
1.4 tonnes per worker per shift, which was lower than that of 
Shiyijie 30 years before. Australia, in contrast, turned out 210 
million tonnes of crude coal in 1990, the whole industry had 
only 29,970 workers and staffers, and output was 24 tonnes per 
worker per shift. 
  The fundamental way to change this 1.4:24 ratio is to 
achieve 
mechanization, cut the number of workers, and improve 
efficiency. The Ministry for Coal Industry recently set out that 
from now on, the level of mine mechanization must maintain an 
annual 2-3 percent growth rate, while the work efficiency of all 
personnel must improve by 5 percent each year.

  [Text] Kunming, February 5 (XINHUA) -- China's first 
itaconic acid production line has been put into production in 
this capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province. 
  With an annual production capacity of 2,000 tons, it is said 
to be the third-biggest in the world. 
  Located in the Yunnan Tianli Bio-Fermentation Plant, the 
line's main equipment was designed, manufactured and installed 
by China, at a cost of over 60 million yuan (about seven million 
U.S. dollars). 
  A high-tech product, itaconic acid is a non-saturation 
binary 
organic acid, widely used in the chemicals, pharmaceuticals, 
building materials, ion-exchanging and light industries. 
  China started research into the acid in 1958, and the 
project 
was listed as a state key project of the Eighth Five-Year Plan 
period (1991-1995). 
  During two years of trial production the plant produced over 
300 tons of itaconic acid, which was exported to Japan, the 
United States, New Zealand and Australia. 
  Sugar is the main raw material in itaconic acid, and Yunnan 
is one of the biggest sugar producers in China, with a total 
output of one million tons last year. 
  Itaconic acid was first discovered in the United States in 
1936, but because of complicated production technology, 
large-scale production only started, in the United States and 
Japan, in the early 1980s.

  [Text] Beijing, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Construction of 
ports in the coastal areas of China is in full swing. 
  So far, China has 300 deepwater berths along its 32,000-km 
coastline, and the total deadweight tonnage of its ocean-going 
ships ranks eighth in the world. 
  According to a plan, more than 100 deep-water berths will be 
added to boost its port handling capacity in 1995. 
  Through years of construction, the country has formed three 
major port groups -- the area around Bohai bay with 40 ports, 
the Chang Jiang river estuary with 20 ports and the southeast 
coastal area with ten ports. 
  Another port group is being formed in Shandong and Jiangsu 
Provinces in the central part of the coastline. 
  A survey shows that the Chang Jiang river estuary has 60 
deep- water berths able to accommodate ships of 10,000 dwt in 
recent years, and the construction of large ports and wharves is 
well under way in the southern coastal areas. 
  By the end of this century China will have some ten ports 
with annual handling capacities exceeding 100 million tons each. 
  While building more ports, China is paying attention to port 
modernization in co-operation with overseas companies. 
  The coastal areas are home to five special economic zones, a 
dozen bonded zones and a number of open coastal cities. 
  The areas around bohai bay have established trade relations 
with 160 countries and regions. 
  As a result, their imports and exports account for more than 
one half of the country's total.

Rolling Stock Industry Develops Rapidly"] 
  [Text] China's rolling stock industry enjoyed rapid and 
healthy development in 1993. This found expression chiefly in 
China-made rolling stock meeting the demand of railway 
transportation at home, with an increasingly greater volume of 
exports overseas. 
  China Railway Rolling Stock Industrial General Company, 
which 
has a reputation of being China's "railway transportation 
equipment department," possessing 35 factories manufacturing 
railway rolling stock, four repair workshops, and four research 
institutes. In recent years, the company has pushed the 
operational strategy "proceeding from the railway, facing the 
whole country, advancing toward the world," and has scored 
eye-catching results. Last year, under the conditions of short 
supply in raw materials and grave shortage of funds, 220 
electric locomotives, 670 internal-combustion locomotives, and 
1,847 passenger cars were turned out, up from the previous year 
by 10, 19, and 11.8 percent, respectively; 28,968 new freight 
cars were built, an increase of 7,332 from the previous year, up 
by 33.9 percent; thus making great contributions to meeting the 
demand of railway transportation resulting from national 
economic growth. Last year, the whole company achieved an 
income of 13.7 billion yuan through marketing, up by 66.7 
percent; all- personnel labor productivity increased by 27.2 
percent; profit realized was 240 million yuan, up by 114.9 
percent; the enterprise retained a profit of 160 million yuan, 
up by 36.3 percent, and the enterprise's development capability 
was augmented markedly. 
  While meeting the needs of domestic railway transportation, 
the China Railway Rolling Sock Industrial General Company took 
an active part in developing the overseas market. Last year, 
both locomotives and passenger and freight cars, as well as 
parts, were exported to eight countries and regions, including 
Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong, with a transaction volume of 
$70.72 million, up by 70 percent from 1992.

1696 1627): "Why Did China Incur Trade Deficit Last Year?"; 
part 1 of 2] 
  [Text] Over several years in the past, China continued to 
maintain a surplus in its foreign trade, but it incurred a 
foreign trade deficit of $12.18 billion in 1993 as its imports 
increased faster than exports. This was the main characteristic 
of China's foreign trade in 1993. The State Council department 
concerned predicted, according to its comprehensive analysis of 
the macroeconomic environment at home and abroad, that China's 
foreign trade in 1994 would continue to incur a deficit, with 
exports increasing at a higher rate while imports will remain at 
the same level. 
  According to customs statistics, in 1993, the total volume 
of 
imports and exports was $195.72 billion, an increase of 8 
percent, which was lower than the 1992 growth rate of 18.3 
percent; the volume of imports was $103.95 billion, an increase 
of 29 percent, which exceeded the 1992 growth rate by 2.9 
percentage points. The relevant department of the State Council 
held that the situation in import and export trade was directly 
related to international and domestic economic circumstances. 
The slowdown of export increases was mainly attributed to four 
factors: First, the export of resource-intensive commodities 
decreased, the costs of exported manufactured goods became 
higher, and prices of some export commodities in the 
international market fell. For example, the prices of crude oil 
products, steel products, and cement declined by 13.1 percent to 
63.9 percent. In addition, the worldwide economic recession 
also brought the prices of such basic products as aquatic 
products, corn, sugar, silk, and plastic net exported by our 
country to lower and lower levels. Although export quantities 
of such products increased, less foreign exchange was earned. 
  Second, a large quantity of export commodities was sold in 
the domestic market. Some products could not be sold in the 
international market because of their poor quality, but they 
could be sold in the domestic market at rather high prices. So 
such products were not exported but sold domestically instead. 
This strained the supply of export commodities, and many foreign 
trade companies could not fulfill their annual business targets. 
  Third, enterprises engaged in export business were short of 
working funds. In the second half of 1992 and in the first half 
of 1993, as the economy was developing rapidly, banks shifted 
more funds to real estate and stocks, and this affected the 
supply of loans for increasing exports. State tax and foreign 
exchange refunds to encourage exports often could not be paid to 
export enterprises on time, and this dampened the enterprises' 
enthusiasm and aggravated the fund shortage for exports. 
  Fourth, exchange rates fluctuated violently in foreign 
exchange transfer centers, which damaged the foundation for 
export cost accounting and also enabled foreign importers to 
force down prices. This thus made it hard to increase exports. 
  The relevant department of the State Council held that in 
addition to the above-mentioned four factors, exporters in 
various localities also lowered prices in order to win in 
business competition or failed to deliver goods on time due to 
the strained transport conditions. The international 
protectionist trend and antidumping taxes were also factors 
slowing down increases in our country's exports. 
  As for the reasons for the rapid increase in imports, the 
department summarized them into three points: 
  First, rapid development of the national economy and 
adjustment of the economic structure sharply increased demand 
for industrial raw materials, machinery, equipment, 
transportation and communications facilities, and also drove up 
the prices of these goods by a big margin. Domestic funds were 
rapidly used to purchase such products, which resulted in an 
increasing amount of funds for imported goods. 
  Second, the number of enterprises with foreign investment 
substantially increased. The quantity of imported equipment and 
materials, as foreign investments, also increased sharply. By 
the end of 1993, there were nearly 140,000 foreign-funded 
enterprises in three categories, and such enterprises increased 
by more than 60,000 in one year. They imported products and 
materials worth $16.63 billion, an increase of 107.4 percent 
over the previous year. The net increase amounted to $8.61 
billion, which accounted for 70.7 percent of China's foreign 
trade deficit. 
  Third, lowered import tariffs also stimulated the increase 
in 
imports. In order to expand opening up and make the domestic 
market converge with the international market, the state lowered 
import tariffs several times, and also gave tax reductions and 
exemptions to a substantial quantity of imported goods. All 
this provided favorable conditions for increasing imports. 
  The relevant department of the State Council held that 
macro-control measures adopted in the second half of 1993 and 
major reform measures to be adopted this year are all conducive 
to settlement of deep-level problems in the foreign trade 
structure that were laid bare by the high-speed development of 
the national economy. Therefore, foreign trade conditions in 
1994 will develop in the orientation of being favorable to 
increasing exports.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 </F>
1696 1627): "China Will Increase Exports This Year"; part 2 of 
2] 
  [Text] Not long ago, State Council Premier Li Peng told 
American visitors that China's import and export trade in 1994 
would reach $200 billion. The relevant department of the State 
Council was optimistic about this, and held that China's imports 
and exports would both increase in 1994. They predicted that 
exports would increase by 14 to 15 percent, and amount to 
somewhere between $104 billion and $106 billion, imports would 
increase by 10 percent and amount to $115 billion, and the trade 
deficit would remain about $10 billion. 
  This department held that there are a number of factors 
promoting China's export increases in 1994. First, overall 
trading conditions would be better than in 1993. In particular, 
as the central authorities continue to strengthen macro-control 
over the economy, the advantageous effects in increasing exports 
will be more prominently shown. For example, the prices of some 
major industrial raw materials and capital goods have 
substantially declined, and this will make enterprises shift 
their attention back to the international market; the strained 
conditions of funds and export goods have been mitigated 
somewhat; the central authorities have completed the action of 
merging the two foreign exchange systems in one move by seizing 
this opportunity, and the de facto devaluation of the currency 
will certainly stimulate exports. In addition, international 
trading conditions are also better than those in 1993, as the 
world economy is recovering, the Uruguay Round trade talks have 
succeeded, and the protectionist trend in international trade 
has been restrained. 
  Second, with regard to the operational system, establishment 
of the modern enterprise system provides an effective way to 
resolve deep-level problems in foreign trade enterprises. For 
example, previous corporations set up in various trades have 
been reorganized into large, transregional, multi-trade, 
internationalized conglomerates engaged in both production and 
trade. Thus, export- oriented productive enterprises can 
directly face the international market. 
  Third, in the form of trade, processing-related trade [jia 
gong mao yi 0502 1562 6319 2496] is now the main trading form 
adopted by China, which has become China's obvious advantage in 
international trade. It is expected that exports through 
processing-related trade will amount to $52 billion, and 
increase by over 17 percent. 
  Fourth, exports made by enterprises with foreign investment 
will continue to increase at a high rate. In 1993, more than 
70,000 new foreign-funded enterprises were set up, and most of 
them are export-oriented enterprises. A larger proportion of 
them are capital- and technology-intensive enterprises, so they 
will increase exports of products with high added value. It is 
expected that their exports will increase at a high rate of over 
35 percent, and the volume of their exports will reach $34 
billion. 
  Fifth, changes are occurring in China's main export markets. 
Through four years' difficult struggle, the U.S. economy stepped 
into obvious growth in the last quarter of 1993. The U.S. 
economy has recovered earlier than those of the European 
Community and Japan, and this made the U.S. dollar firm and kept 
import costs low. Such firmness of the U.S. dollar will last 
throughout the year 1994. Being the major consumption market of 
the Chinese products, increased imports in the United States 
will benefit China. In 1994, China will substantially increase 
its exportation of farm produce to Japan, and overall exports to 
Japan will also increase at a moderate rate [zhong su zeng zhang 
0022 6643 1073 7022]. However, China's exports to the European 
Community in 1994 will increase rather slowly. 
  In 1994, China's imports will increase by about 10 percent. 
As far as policy is concerned, the state will further lower 
import tariffs for many products, and this will further 
stimulate imports. In addition, China will maintain a certain 
size of imported raw materials, equipment, and technology, and 
will continue to import a large quantity of raw materials for 
re-export-oriented processing. The number of foreign investment 
enterprises will continue to increase in 1994, and this will 
bring about a rapid increase in the importation of equipment and 
materials. It is expected that such imports will increase by 50 
percent over 1993. 
  The department concerned held that there will remain quite a 
few factors unfavorable to expansion of exports: Protectionist 
practices continue to prevail in international trade; it is hard 
to solve the contradiction of the distribution of raw materials 
which are needed in export business and are also needed in the 
development of the national economy; the economic growth rate, 
the inflation rate, the currency supply, and the actual process 
of economic structural reforms this year in China will all 
affect the growth rate of exports. On the whole, however, the 
prospects of China's exports and imports in 1994 are good.

  [Text] Beijing, February 5 (CNS)--China has become the 
second biggest country to absorb international capital with 
83,265 foreign investment items newly approved last year with 
contracted foreign capital amounting to US$110.852 billion and 
actual utilization of such capital put at US$25.759 billion, 
respective increase of 70.68 percent, 90.7 percent and 134 
percent over the previous year and all totalling as much as for 
the whole of the previous 14 years since reform and opening to 
the outside world started. 
  Last year's foreign investment in China had certain new 
features. More than 100 foreign countries and regions had 
investment in China and such investment had extended to the 
inland areas of the country from the coastal regions with the 
increase of foreign investment in the inland exceeding that in 
the coastal regions. Foreign investment expanded into such 
fields as capital, technologically-intensive industry and 
infrastructural construction, energy and raw materials. Many 
internationally-known corporations saw China as an important 
investment target. Of 500 big American companies, 52 invested 
in China with each investment item put at close to US$46 
million. The scale of production was also increased with each 
item having contracted foreign capital of US$1.33 million on 
average last year, 12.9 percent up compared with that of 
US$1.178 million the year before. 
  Up until now, most of the foreign-funded enterprises in 
China 
have been running well with the import and export value of such 
enterprises reaching US$67.07 billion, making up 34.3 percent of 
the total import and export value for the whole country and 
their exports have become the main source of foreign exchange in 
some regions in the country. 
  By the end of last year, China had approved 173,975 
foreign-funded items with contracted foreign capital of 
US$217.216 billion and actual utilization of foreign capital of 
US$56.912 billion.

  Companies engaging in small-volume border trade are subject 
to approval by the ministry regarding their setting up and 
trading sites set up by residents of border areas at border 
trade fairs will be organized in a unified way and managed by 
provincial governments. 
  Before the end of 1995, those companies approved by the 
ministry will have their import tariff and product tax reduced 
by 50 percent on some of their traded commodities (except for 
electro-mechanical products, cigarettes, wines and cosmetics). 
Products worth less than RMB 300 [renminbi] will have taxes 
imposed on them according to regulations while those products 
such as cigarettes, wines and cosmetics will all have taxes 
levied on them. 
  Border trade companies are allowed to export a small amount 
of commodities listed as Category Two and Category Three within 
the total quotas granted by the ministry. 
  Items for cooperation between the border areas and their 
corresponding areas in foreign countries are subject to approval 
by the department in charge of foreign trade and economy under 
the provincial government and commodities (except for 
electro-mechanical products, cigarettes, wines and cosmetics) 
imported through such cooperation and used for the payment to 
laborers on the Chinese side will not have any import tariff and 
product tax levied on them while those other than for this 
purpose will have their taxes reduced by 50 percent.

<F P=106> [By BAN YUE TAN reporter Wang Yuexin (3769 1878 2946): </F>
"State Councillor Chen Junsheng Discusses the Issue of Peasants' 
Income"; first paragraph is BAN YUE TAN introduction] 
  [Text] Editor's note: It appears that drastic increases in 
grain and edible-oil prices since last November have 
overshadowed the issue of peasants' income. As a matter of 
fact, because the state's economic control and regulatory 
measures yield the desired results, the excessively high grain 
and edible-oil prices are bound to drop, and increasing 
peasants' income will remain a pressing task. Therefore, 
Comrade Chen Junsheng's following interview with the staff 
reporter given at the beginning of the new year merits the keen 
attention of all. 
  [Wang Yuexin] In recent years, we have reaped an all-round 
bumper harvest in agriculture. Despite the increased output, 
the incomes of peasants in some rural areas have not increased. 
What do you think are the major causes of this? 
  [Chen Junsheng] Last year the situation in agriculture and 
rural areas across the country was pretty good. However, 
despite the relatively good situation in agriculture as a whole, 
there is a potential problem -- that is, the slow increase of 
peasants' income. The per capita net income of peasants in 1993 
is expected to reach 860 yuan, up 76 yuan from, or 15 percent 
more than, 1992. After subtracting for inflation, the increase 
is only about 2 percent, or 3.9 percent less than the margin of 
increase in the preceding year. This problem is more serious in 
major grain-producing regions. The more a region produces 
grain, the slower its peasants' incomes increase. In some 
regions, increased output even does not bring about an increase 
in their peasants' incomes. The main cause of the decreased 
incomes of peasants lies in the widening price disparity between 
manufactured and farm products. In recent years, the prices of 
agricultural means of production have increased at a much faster 
rate than those of farm products. At the end of 1993, price 
increases for agricultural means of production stood at 13.5 
percent, and for peasants' means of subsistence, at over 10 
percent. The relatively low efficiency of agricultural 
production and the decreased incomes of peasants have 
significantly dampened their enthusiasm for production, have 
impeded the growth of the rural economy, and have hindered the 
solution of other problems concerning agriculture, rural areas, 
and peasants. 
  [Wang] What are the major effects on the rural economy 
caused by the slow or negative growth of peasants' income? 
  [Chen] Due to their low income, peasants have invested less 
and less money in production. Between 1989 and 1992, peasants' 
spending on purchasing means of production increased, after 
subtracting for inflation, by a mere 1.5 percent annually. Last 
year's input for purchasing means of production, after 
subtracting for inflation, is expected to drop by 5 percent, and 
the input into production as a whole is expected to drop by 2.9 
percent. As a result, agriculture is devoid of the strength for 
long-term development. 
  Due to low incomes, it is difficult to promote public 
welfare 
projects in rural areas. At present, some local governments and 
departments are trying to carry out a number of public welfare 
projects through raising funds from peasants. This is a good 
idea. However, while an identical amount of funds that has been 
raised is not considered a burden in regions where peasants 
enjoy a higher level of income and are financially better off, 
it is considered a very heavy burden in regions where peasants 
have less income and are vulnerable to financial straits. 
Because the income of the majority of peasants remains rather 
low and cannot be increased, or has even decreased, it is very 
difficult to change the outlook for the countryside. 
  Due to their low income, peasants' purchasing power is weak. 
Between 1989 and 1992, the total volume of retail sales in rural 
areas increased only 1 percent annually, after subtracting for 
inflation. Peasants' consumption expenditure in 1993 is 
expected to decrease compared to the preceding year, thus 
widening the gap between urban and rural residents' incomes and 
between urban and rural markets. A comparison of statistics 
between 1988 and 1992 shows that the ratio between urban and 
rural residents' incomes has increased from 2.05:1 to 2.33:1, 
whereas the ratio of the total volume of retail sales between 
urban and rural areas has decreased from 1:1.39 to 1:1.096. 
Since the beginning of last year, the disparity between urban 
and rural markets has continued to widen. Market stagnation in 
rural areas has hampered the expansion of industrial goods 
markets and has directly affected the growth of state funds' 
accumulation and the development of the national economy. 
  [Wang] In your opinion, what approaches or measures should 
be taken to solve problems in regard to the peasants' income? 
  [Chen] To quickly raise the peasants' income, we must 
proceed from the overall situation of economic development, 
conscientiously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Central 
Conference on Rural Work, and effectively implement the 
following tasks: 
  1. We must increase the purchasing prices of agricultural 
products. The purchasing prices of agricultural products should 
be appropriately increased this year to make up for the 
additional expenses on the part of peasants caused by rising 
production costs, and to help appropriately increase their 
income. 
  2. We must increase the input in agriculture. This means 
increasing investments in agriculture, which has so far 
accounted for only a rather small proportion of investment in 
the entire economy. We should make increases in three 
proportions: in credit volume, in the total investment in 
capital construction, and in financial input. These are the 
essential requirements for stabilizing agriculture, the 
foundation of our economy. 
  3. Active efforts should be made to readjust agricultural 
production and the product structure. An impasse facing China's 
agriculture is that it is impossible to completely reverse the 
trend of dwindling arable lands; it is also impossible to 
reverse the trend of a growing population and market demands. 
These two irreversibles require that we steadily increase the 
total grain output while implementing a readjustment of 
agricultural production and the product structure. We must 
invigorate agriculture by applying scientific and technological 
advances and by promoting education. We should popularize and 
make full use of the latest scientific and technological 
advances and quickly turn them into productive forces. We 
should develop new varieties of grain and cotton crops, improve 
product quality, and improve economic efficiency in line with 
market demands. Vigorous efforts should be made to increase the 
peasants' income by developing processing, transportation, and 
marketing of agricultural products in rural areas; by promoting 
coordinated development of the primary, secondary, and tertiary 
sectors in the rural economy; and by bringing about multiple 
increases in the value of agricultural products. 
  4. We must invigorate circulation of agricultural products 
and enliven rural markets. 
  5. We must develop village and township enterprises. The 
general requirements in this regard are: In developing village 
and township enterprises, we should truly shift the emphasis 
onto relying on the development of science and technology and on 
the improvement of quality of the laborers; we should refrain 
from launching new projects or seeking unrealistic growth rates, 
devote major efforts to implementing technological upgrading and 
readjusting the products structure, implement strict scientific 
administration, and improve economic returns in real earnest. 
Village and township enterprises in eastern regions shall 
transform themselves to become more efficient and export 
oriented; shall readjust their industrial structure and product 
mix; and shall make improvements in terms of overall levels, 
quality, scale, and economic returns. Areas in central and 
western China should accelerate the development of village and 
township enterprises. Efforts should be made to organize the 
implementation of the "East-West Cooperation and Development 
Project" so that localities can supplement each other's 
advantages and promote common development. We should build 
small industrial zones to push forward the development of small 
towns and service trades in the countryside. 
  6. We must transfer surplus labor force in rural areas in a 
step by step manner. One reason for the slow growth in the 
peasants' income is underemployment. Presently there are 170 
million surplus laborers in rural areas. This surplus labor 
force poses a major challenge for rural areas. Realistically 
speaking, it is possible to transfer a portion of the surplus 
labor force to industry or other non-agricultural sectors every 
year. On average, 10 million laborers were transferred out of 
the agricultural sector yearly from 1985 to 1988. The figure in 
1992 was 11 million, and the 1993 figure is expected to be even 
higher. 
  7. We must continue the efforts to reduce the multitudinous 
fees imposed on peasants. To effectively reduce the peasants' 
burden, last year the CPC Central Committee and State Council 
formulated a policy and issued documents, which are fully 
supported by the people. Reducing the peasants' burden is a 
policy measure designed to protect the peasants' enthusiasm for 
production; it also serves as an effective way to raise the 
peasants' income. In conscientiously implementing the central 
authorities' policy on easing the peasants' burden, government 
and relevant departments at all levels have, since last year, 
done a great deal of painstaking and meticulous work, thereby 
effectively putting a stop to illegal collection of fees, fines, 
and other charges in the countryside and drastically reducing 
the reasonable burden imposed on the peasants. In view of the 
actual conditions, potential factors for increasing the 
peasants' burden have yet to be removed once and for all, and 
there is the possibility of a resurgence; therefore, we must not 
lower our guard. 
  8. It is necessary to ensure a good job in assisting the 
poor. Presently some 80 million people in rural areas still do 
not have enough to eat and wear. Without solving the problem of 
food and clothing for this segment of the population, it will be 
difficult to realize prosperity in the entire country. To solve 
the problem, the State Council has decided to draw up and 
implement a "seven-year cardinal program to help the 80 million 
poor." Under the program, in the seven years beginning in 1994 
until the end of this century, the state will concentrate 
primary resources on helping this segment of the population find 
enough to eat and wear, thus becoming better off. 
Aid-to-the-poor work in the next phase should be carried out in 
close conjunction with the formulation and implementation of the 
"seven-year program." First, it is necessary to earnestly 
review aid to the poor, and to study and work out new methods 
and measures for helping the poor under the new situation. 
Second, it is necessary to perfect various policy measures and 
increase the input in assisting the poor. Third, it is 
necessary to concentrate funds and materials for helping the 
poor by rationalizing the geographical distribution of 
aid-to-the-poor funds to gradually concentrate the central 
government's funds in the poorest central and western regions. 
  [Wang] You have just mentioned an increase in the purchase 
price of farm products as deemed necessary this year. What are 
the principles for deciding the increase margin? 
  [Chen] The increase in the purchase price of farm products 
will be based mainly on four principles: 1) The increase can 
offset the increased cost in grain and cotton production caused 
by price increases in agricultural production means and all 
other commodities. 2) It can somehow increase the peasants' 
incomes. 3) It can maintain a rational disparity between grain 
and cotton prices. 4) It is compatible with the general price 
index of retail sales. A grain risk fund shall be established 
at both central and local levels to facilitate the smooth 
implementation of price increase proposals. Through increasing 
the purchase price, we shall gradually reduce the price gap 
between manufactured and farm products, and shall help some 
grain- and cotton-producing provinces (regions) solve once and 
for all the problems of more output and more deficits. By 
giving subsidies, we shall also help remote and poor regions 
overcome hardships caused by long-distance transportation of 
increase-priced grain and cotton. 
  [Wang] Could you discuss more specifically the measures for 
invigorating the circulation of farm products and rural markets 
which provide the important means for increasing the peasants' 
incomes? 
  [Chen] First, we should link production markets with 
information and contracts. So far, prices have been 
decontrolled for the overwhelming majority of farm products 
except for cotton, silkworm cocoons, and a few others. 
Presently the main problem is the dislocation between the 
production of individual farm households and market demands. 
Many peasants are ill-informed about markets and cannot cope 
with market demands. They do not know what should be produced 
and can be sold at good prices. Therefore, it is essential to 
provide information service to peasants, to increase the effort 
to construct supply and demand information networks for farm 
products, to supply timely forecasts and announcements on supply 
and demand of farm products, to provide timely purchasing and 
marketing information, and to guide peasants to do a good job in 
production and operation. 
  Second, we should actively guide and organize peasants to 
orient their production to market demands by building a bridge 
linking producers with consumers. In recent years, we have seen 
the emergence of various forms of integrated management of 
trade, industry, and agriculture; of close combination of 
production and processing with marketing; of companies embracing 
farm households; and of trade associations. These 
organizations, which have effectively guided peasants to 
markets, should be supported actively. We should break the 
restrictions of the ownership system and administration division 
in integrating agriculture, industry, commerce, technology, and 
trade, gearing their production to domestic and international 
markets as well as enabling them to become unified entities 
sharing common risks and interests through socialized service 
and profit guidance. 
  Third, we should develop a market system of agricultural 
products and establish a regular order of market operations. To 
facilitate the development of a market system, the state has 
decontrolled the prices of most agricultural products and 
adopted a new policy which allows agricultural products to be 
traded through multiple channels, with their prices established 
by the market. However, some localities are still barring 
outside products with numerous barriers and blocks. This has 
hampered the free flow of goods and the formation of a large, 
unified nationwide market, making it hard to accelerate the 
development of production. A market is a system; we should 
develop a primary market for producers as well as a retail 
market in marketing areas. Most important of all is to build 
all sorts of wholesale markets and to cultivate and develop a 
market system for agricultural products under a unified plan, 
with an emphasis on the wholesale market. 
  [Wang] We have gained some experience in transferring 
surplus rural work forces. Is there more we can do in this 
regard? 
  [Chen] Transferring surplus rural work forces requires a 
multi-pronged approach: First, we should vigorously develop 
village and township enterprises. This is the principal way for 
placing the surplus work force. Nationwide, some 112 million 
people are employed at village and township enterprises, of 
which 9.72 million were employed in 1992. The figure for 1993 
is estimated at around 7 million. Our plan is that 50 million 
more people will be shifted out of the agricultural sector by 
the end of the century. Second, we should fully utilize and 
develop agricultural resources, expand the space for 
agricultural development, and create more agricultural jobs. 
Third, we should work hard to create conditions -- and work out 
well-coordinated plans -- for agricultural workers to work in 
cities and towns. Fourth, we should develop small towns in a 
well-planned manner, vigorously promote the secondary and 
tertiary sectors of the economy, increase training in useful 
skills among the peasants to increase their employability, and 
gradually shift the surplus rural work force to non-agricultural 
sectors.

  [Text] Beijing, February 7 (XINHUA) -- In 1993 China's 
total grain output hit a record 456.4 million tons, despite the 
fact that the total grain area had shrunk over the previous few 
years. 
  The figure means that the total grain production increased 
by 
50 percent in three leaps between 1979 and 1993. 
  The country's total grain output was 300 million tons in 
1979, 354.5 million tons in 1982, 407.3 million tons in 1984, 
and 456.4 million tons in 1993. 
  According to analyses done by foreign economists, out of 
every extra 50 kg of grain harvested worldwide between 1980 and 
1991 20 kg were increased in China.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Zhide (2612 3112 1795): "Prospects for </F>
Cross-Strait Cooperation in Science and Technology Are Bright -- 
Interview With the President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
CAS, Zhou Guangzhao"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Jan (XINHUA) -- Zhou Guangzhao, 
president of the CAS and a famous scientist who just returned 
from an exchange visit to Taiwan, said in a recent interview 
with this reporter: The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have 
their own strong points in scientific research and industrial 
technology development. Enhancing and quickening cross-strait 
exchanges and cooperation in science and technology will be 
conducive to the economies and scientific and technological 
development of both sides. This tendency is irresistible and 
its prospects are bright. 
  Leading a delegation to attend the "1994 Cross-Strait 
Conference on Technologies of the Steel and Material 
Industries," Zhou Guangzhao arrived in Taibei [Taipei] on 17 
January. Others who attended this conference included several 
well-known scientists from the CAS as well as experts from the 
Shougang Corporation, the Anshan Steel Corporation, the Wuhan 
Steel Corporation, the Panzhihua Steel Corporation, and the 
China Metals Import and Export Corporation. When asked about 
what he thought of his exchange visit to Taiwan, Zhou Guangzhao 
said: I certainly felt very happy that I was able to visit our 
country's prized island, conduct exchanges there, and do 
something for the development of cross-strait exchanges. In 
this exchange visit to Taiwan, Mainland scientists, technicians, 
and enterprise representatives were well received in Taiwan. 
This shows the willingness of people on Taiwan to enhance 
exchanges. 
  Zhou Guangzhao held: This conference further specified both 
sides' individual strong points in resources and technologies. 
If we can enhance our cooperation, it will be conducive to 
development on both sides. He explained: The Mainland is 
blessed with rich resources, affluent supplies of raw and 
semifinished materials, and abundant scientists and technicians, 
whereas Taiwan has a solid basis of technology and is very good 
at developing and commercializing research results. Take 
material technology for example; rare earth is very useful in 
many fields of high technology industries such as motor 
manufacturing, special semiconductors, new magnetic materials, 
and superconductors. According to statistics on proven 
reserves, more than a half of the world's rare earth resources 
are in the Mainland. However, the Mainland still has a lot of 
catching up to do in developing technologies for exploiting and 
applying rare earth elements, while Taiwan has strong production 
and applied mechanical and electrical technologies. He said: 
Taiwan has many electrical manufacturers. If they use rare 
earth to produce electrical products, the performance of their 
products will be even better. Suffering from the lack of raw 
and semifinished materials on Taiwan, these manufacturers are 
not able to give full play to their strong points. As for steel 
materials, Taiwan's steel output has increased by a large margin 
in recent years. The annual output of the "China Steel 
Corporation" on Taiwan currently exceeds 6 million tonnes, and 
it is marching toward the goal of 9 million tonnes. 
Nevertheless, the market on the island is quite small after all 
and its development potential is limited. On the other hand, 
the Mainland's broad market and abundant raw and semifinished 
materials represent an advantage for development. Therefore, 
the two sides need to further cooperate with each other. 
  Speaking on the present situation and prospects for 
cross-strait cooperation, Zhou Guangzhao pointed out: At 
present, some Taiwan industries depend heavily on foreign 
countries. A number of persons with insight on Taiwan hope to 
find cooperation partners on the Mainland to reduce dependence 
on foreign countries. He said: The two sides should work hand 
in hand to develope some technological industries. Again, he 
took rare earth as an example and said: The two sides are 
intensifying efforts to develop industries in this field. It 
will absolutely help accelerate development if they can make 
good use of their strong points, strengthen cooperation, and 
complement each other with their own advantages. 
  Zhou Guangzhao said: Some progress has now been made in 
scientific and technological exchanges between the two sides. 
Quite a few Taiwan researchers have visited the Mainland and 
conduct exchanges. This time Mainland scientists were invited 
to visit Taiwan. These visits and exchanges promote 
understanding. Moreover, many cross-strait science and 
technology [S&amp;T] cooperation projects are underway in 
communications, radiation synchrotrons, and marine science. The 
range for cooperation is very broad, including basic theory, 
applications of technology, industrial development, and even 
nuclear science and technology. In conclusion, he said: Under 
the premise of mutual benefit and reciprocity, we will make 
efforts to promote further cooperation between S&amp;T circles 
from 
both sides.

  [Text] This morning, the provincial government held a 
plenary meeting to discuss the government work report to be 
submitted to the Second Session of the Eighth Jiangxi Provincial 
People's Congress. Present at the meeting were Wu Guanzheng, Shu 
Shengyou, Huang Zhiquan, Zhou Zhiping, Zhang Yunchuan, Wang 
Maoheng, and Jiang Zhongping. Members of the provincial 
government and principal leaders of the relevant government 
departments also attended the meeting. Governor Wu Guanzheng 
chaired the meeting, which discussed and revised the government 
work, and reviewed last year's achievements. 
  The report points out: The past year has been one in which 
the province maintained speedy national economic growth, in 
which major progress was made in reform, in which the people's 
lives continued to improve, and in which new progress was made 
in building the material and spiritual civilizations. Last 
year, the province's GNP amounted to 68.6 billion yuan, an 
increase of 15.8 percent over the previous year. Gross 
industrial and agricultural output value amounted to 122.1 
billion yuan, an increase of 27.5 percent; of this amount, the 
gross agricultural output value was 38.8 billion yuan, an 
increase of 5.1 percent. This year is a crucial one for 
promoting the establishment of the socialist market economy 
structure, an important year for maintaining a good economic 
development trend, and a crucial year for accelerating the 
construction of basic facilities and industries and for 
promoting Jiangxi's economy to a new level. 
  The provincial government asks the people throughout the 
province to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, to widen the 
scope of opening up, to bring about further development, to 
maintain stability, to move forward boldly with an enterprising 
spirit, to work hard and in a down-to-earth manner, to base 
themselves on agriculture, and to devote major efforts to 
industrial development so as to lay a good foundation for future 
development. 
  In his speech at the meeting, Wu Guanzheng stressed: In 
economic work, we must bring economic returns into prominence. 
People in all trades and undertakings must pay close attention 
to improving economic returns and must work out detailed 
measures and objectives. There is a need for county-level 
economic development; for developing high-yield, high-quality, 
and highly efficient agriculture; and for accurately selecting 
projects and improving economic results in the development of 
town and township enterprises. In the meantime, it is necessary 
to continue developing the individual and private economic 
sectors, as well as the foreign-invested economic sectors. In 
the course of stimulating economic development, we should handle 
correctly the relationship among reform, development, and 
stability; accelerate the establishment of the social insurance 
system; strengthen control over government officials; improve 
the comprehensive management of social order; increase the 
masses' sense of safety; and ensure increases in the peasants' 
per capita net income and increases in revenue.

(7281 5391): "Yunnan Party Secretary Pu Chaozhu on Development 
of Relatively Comfortable Villages"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, at a forum on the development of 
relatively comfortable villages in Kunming, provincial party 
Secretary Pu Chaozhu stressed: "We must have a clear 
understanding of the situation, seize the opportunity, select 
the right path, rely on large state-owned enterprises, have wide 
connections with scientific research and technological units, 
orient towards the two large markets at home and abroad, and 
vigorously develop township and town enterprises." 
  On 24 January the forum on the development of relatively 
comfortable villages was jointly held by Kunming party committee 
and the city government in Guandu District. Every comrade 
attending the forum tried to get the floor and the atmosphere 
was lively. Representatives of 19 townships and towns, with a 
gross income exceeding 100 million yuan, and of six offices 
throughout the city attended the forum. Sun Gan, secretary of 
the city party committee, Vice Mayor Xu Zhixin, Ba Weiguo, 
director of the provincial administration of township and town 
enterprises, and Li Yuanshu, deputy director of the Provincial 
Administration of Township and Town Enterprises, and leading 
cadres of concerned counties and prefectures attended the forum. 
  Guandu District Party Secretary Zhao Jian briefed attendants 
on the experience of planning rural work as a whole and bringing 
about all-round development of the rural economy by moving 
towards a relatively comfortable life. Lianmeng is known as the 
"most outstanding township in Yunnan," and what Jin Wenming, 
secretary of Lianmeng party committee, said made the argument of 
"relying on old townships to march towards a relatively 
comfortable life" more convincing. In 1993, the gross income of 
township and town enterprises in Lianmeng reached 583 million 
yuan, which accounted for 99.8 percent of the gross income of 
the whole town. People earned more due to the development of 
township and town enterprises, and per capita net income 
increased over 1,500 yuan a year, thus leading to a relatively 
comfortable life. Representatives of the offices of townships 
and towns, such as Majie, separately briefed attendants on the 
experience of linking up with large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises and with scientific research units, introducing 
foreign capital to develop foreign-invested enterprises, and 
setting up joint-stock cooperative enterprises. 
  Pu Chaozhu attended the forum from beginning to end. He 
conscientiously listened to the speeches, frequently raised 
questions and exchanged views with others, and made systematic 
remarks on the question of developing township and town 
enterprises. 
  When talking about the points of fully affirming the results 
and conscientiously summing up the experience of developing 
township and town enterprises, Pu Chaozhu said that township and 
town enterprises in Kunming made a breakthrough and developed by 
leaps and bounds in 1993. The gross income of township and town 
enterprises throughout the whole city increased by 95 percent 
and reached 12 billion yuan. The pace of development of Guandu 
District, which had a large base, was startling since it 
achieved 129 percent of economic growth and, as a result, the 
gross income of township and town enterprise throughout the 
district reached 3.738 billion yuan. More gratifying is that 
township and town enterprises, whether in Kunming or in Guandu 
District, were able to achieve growth in output value as well as 
in revenues and tax, and the increase in revenues and tax last 
year was over 90 percent. There was huge growth of township and 
town enterprises which are joint ventures in nature. This 
development trend of township and town enterprises is not 
achieved by chance and many practices and experiences can be 
summed up because they are not general experiences which are 
universally applicable. Rather, we must proceed from local 
conditions to sum up unique, rational, and regularized 
experience so as to guide future work and practices. This helps 
some cadres and people overcome the thinking of "being content 
with small improvements" and "being satisfied with small 
wealth," so that they will be more willing and capable to run 
township and town enterprises. 
  Pu Chaozhu said: The situation is very good and the 
opportunity is hard to come by. We must take the opportunity to 
speed up the development of township and town enterprises. He 
said: As far as the large development opportunity is concerned, 
the old pattern of two superpowers' domination of the world was 
broken but a new multipolar pattern has not taken shape, peace 
and development is the main trend of the world, and we can have 
a relatively long period of international peace to develop 
ourselves. In our country, the economy is prosperous, 
nationalities are united, and our society is stable. This is an 
opportunity of joint development shared by the whole country and 
the whole province. As the provincial capital city, Kunming has 
its own unique opportunity and superiority: First, Kunming is 
the central city of Yunnan, with 40 percent of large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises and 70 percent of colleges 
and universities located there. In short, Kunming is the 
political, economic, scientific and technological, and cultural 
center of the whole province, thus creating extremely favorable 
conditions for combining urban areas with rural areas in 
accelerating the development of township and town enterprises. 
This is called the superiority of developing comprehensive 
industries in comprehensive cities. Second, there is marked 
superiority in the location of the city. Five railways destined 
for coastal areas, Beijing, and Vietnam are linked to Kunming, 
six main highways in the province start from Kunming, and 
Kunming Airport is being built into an international airport. 
In short, Kunming has become the hub of communications and the 
center of commodity distribution for those who want to enter 
Southeast Asia and South Asia from Southwest China. As long as 
we orient toward the 1 billion-strong large market in Southeast 
Asia and South Asia while relying on the 1 billion-strong large 
domestic market, we have very bright prospects of developing an 
export-oriented economy. To develop a commodity economy we must 
first have a market. Third, cheap labor and low land prices 
help attract domestic and foreign investors to run factories in 
Kunming. Such opportunities have emerged inside and outside 
China, that is, labor-intensive industries are moving to places 
with cheap labor and low land prices, which is very advantageous 
to the development of textile, clothing, and foodstuff 
industries and manufactured goods for daily use in Kunming. Pu 
Chaozhu said: What we have is a dynamic and fleeting 
opportunity. We must never miss such an opportunity of 
development but rather seize it to accelerate our development. 
  When talking about how to develop township and town 
enterprises, Pu Chaozhu said: We must sum up our experiences 
and have a clear understanding of the situation on the basis of 
accelerating the development of township and town enterprises. 
To accelerate our development, we must have a correct train of 
thought and guide the development of township and town 
enterprises with the thinking of deepening reform and opening up 
wider. The concrete practices are as follows: 
  1. By relying on large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises and having wide connections with scientific research 
and technological units, efforts must be made to develop the 
joint-stock cooperative system so as to transform township and 
town enterprises into joint-stock enterprises with multiple 
systems of ownership. Large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises have capital and qualified personnel, scientific 
research and technological units in colleges and universities 
have knowledge of science and technology and management as well 
as quick access to information, and land and surplus labor is 
available in township and town enterprises. If the mechanism of 
township and town enterprises is vigorous, the combinations of 
urban and rural areas, of science and technology with the 
economy, and of opening up and development must definitely be 
optimized combinations of factors of production. By so doing, 
strong productive forces will be formed to advance township and 
town enterprises to a new stage of development, which is the 
stage of a large scale of export-oriented development at a high 
starting point. As far as the joint-stock system is concerned, 
persons possessing science and technology can also become 
stockholders. We must develop multiple joint-stock enterprises, 
which can solve the problem of insufficient funds in developing 
township and town enterprises as well as invigorate them. Large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises should diversify their 
products and township and town enterprises should be willing to 
play a supporting role and implement socialized production on a 
large scale so as to benefit all parties. 
  2. We must develop an export-oriented economy by taking the 
market as the guide and orienting towards the two large markets 
at home and abroad. To develop township and town enterprises, 
we must have the market concept. Kunming has moved from the 
rear to the forefront in the process of opening up to the 
outside world and is now being built into a central city opening 
up to the outside world. Boundary lines throughout the province 
exceed 4,000 km and we can use a number of border trade ports. 
Since the economy of Yunnan strongly complements with that of 
neighboring countries, we have bright prospects of developing an 
export-oriented economy. As long as we aim at the two large 
markets at home and abroad, change our domestically oriented 
economy into an export-oriented one, and make future plans, it 
is absolutely possible to advance our economy to a new stage in 
one to two years' time. 
  3. We must closely integrate, with the spirit of reform, 
large processing enterprises in urban areas with the 
construction of raw material bases in rural areas. Only when we 
intensify our reform can we pour new vitality into the 
development of township and town enterprises. An important 
content of deepening reform is precisely to change the pattern 
of production and management, as well as the system of economic 
administration and take an integrative path of development, 
particularly integrating large processing enterprises in urban 
areas with the construction of raw material bases in rural 
areas. Without a stable source of raw materials, the processing 
industry in urban areas will certainly fluctuate and make bricks 
without straw. Hence, processing enterprises in urban areas 
must give priority to the work of establishing raw material 
bases, and so do township and town enterprises and state-owned 
enterprises.

devotion so as to create a fine social mood of respecting and 
loving the elderly, should show concern and care for them in 
politics and life, and should create conditions for their good 
health and longevity and for them to devote their remaining 
efforts, so that they will spend their remaining years happily. 
The letter sincerely wishes retired cadres and elderly people 
throughout the province a happy Lunar New Year and a harmonious 
family.

  [Text] The provincial government recently held an executive 
meeting to address the problem of IOU's issued during the 
purchases of such raw materials as beets, flax, and flue-cured 
tobacco and the problem of low comparative efficiency of these 
raw materials. It studied the specific ways to solve these 
problems and issued some preferential policies and measures. 
  These policies and measures include mainly the following: 
  1. Finance departments, banks, and the enterprises engaged 
in 
the processing of these materials will make concerted efforts to 
arrange special funds to pay off the arrears owed peasants 
during the purchases of beets, flax, and flue-cured tobacco 
before the end of February. Efforts will be made to ensure that 
no new IOU is issued during this year's purchases. 
  2. The purchasing prices of beets, flax, and flue-cured 
tobacco will be adjusted. In this year's purchases of beets, 
the county will be taken as the accounting unit. The purchasing 
price of the beets whose sugar content is 16.5 percent or more 
will be increased from 155 yuan per tonne to 180 yuan, the 
purchasing price of the beets whose sugar content is lower than 
16.5 percent will be increased from 140 yuan per tonne to 165 
yuan, and 165 yuan per tonne will be the lowest protection price 
for the purchases. The purchasing price of flax will be 
increased by 20 to 40 percent from the current price. Regarding 
the purchasing price of flue-cured tobacco, the state already 
increased the overall price from 130 yuan per dan to 165 yuan 
last August, and therefore the price will not be adjusted this 
time. 
  3. Various preferential policies will be continued. In beet 
production, seeds will be sold at half the price, mix pesticides 
will be provided free of charge, and mileage subsidies will be 
given for transportation. The subsidy for vertical cultivation 
of seedlings will be increased from 36 yuan per mu to 54 yuan. 
Regarding flue-cured tobacco production, the profits and taxes 
will be shared 50 to 50 percent or 30 to 70 percent by the state 
and counties, and the money will be used in subsidizing 
peasants' production and supplies of materials. 
  4. Construction of sugar, flax, flue-cured tobacco 
production 
bases will be intensified, and integrated management of trade, 
industry, and agriculture will be applied. Beginning this year, 
experiment will be conducted in the construction of the base 
areas. Every processing enterprises will select two to three 
major beet, flax, and flue-cured tobacco producing townships as 
the base areas. The focus is on the construction of the villages 
that applies the vertical cultivation of beet seedlings to 1,000 
mu each and the villages that produce high yields thanks to 
comprehensive technology dissemination. These villages will be 
supported with certain amount of investment, and the overall 
coordinated service focusing on farm mechanization will be 
enhanced. 
  To boost the enthusiasm of the governments at all levels, 
the 
provincial government decided that beginning this year, all 
specialized corporations should conduct the experiment first in 
two to three counties where conditions permit and define the 
base production figures of these raw materials. The economic 
benefits gained from the processing of the materials above the 
base figures will be shared 30 to 70 percent or 40 to 60 percent 
by the corporations and the counties so that the counties and 
the people can gain more benefits. 
  The provincial government also urged the governments at all 
levels to adopt measures to ensure implementation of this year's 
beet, flax, and flue-cured tobacco production targets by all 
parts concerned. Based on the guidance plan formulated by the 
province, governments at all levels should continue to assign 
plans to every level and, on the premise that peasants' opinions 
are fully respected, to peasant households in the form of 
economic contracts so that peasants will know their production 
tasks one year ahead of time. Counties and townships should 
send a number of full-time cadres to coordinate with beet and 
flax mills to publicize the policies and provide service to 
villages and households, to resolve their misgivings and 
difficulties, and to organize well the signing of the contracts. 
They should also write down the preferential policies provided 
by higher levels in the contracts so that the responsibility of 
all parts concerned will be clarified. To meet the needs of the 
enterprises engaged in the processing of beets, flax, and 
flue-cured tobacco, the provincial government decided that this 
year, 6 million mu of beets will be planted, and the output will 
be 6 million tonnes; and 1.1 million mu of flax will be planted, 
and the output will be 180,000 tonnes. In flue-cured tobacco 
production, due to the outstripping of production over marketing 
in the country, the tobacco planting areas are arranged at 
850,000 mu, and the output will be 85,000 tonnes.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "National News </F>
Hookup" program] 
  [Text] At a time when the Spring Festival, a traditional 
festival of Chinese people of all nationalities, is around the 
corner, Comrade Deng Xiaoping happily got together with leading 
party, government, and military comrades and some veteran cadres 
in Shanghai this afternoon. They exchanged Spring Festival 
greetings and best regards, and happily posed for a group 
picture with comrades in Shanghai. [video shows medium 
close-ups of Deng Xiaoping, escorted by his two daughters, Deng 
Nan and Deng Rong, stepping into a room and being introduced to 
Shanghai CPC Secretary Wu Bangguo, Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, and 
other Shanghai officials. Deng Xiaoping looks frail and 
motionless. There is very little head movement (either 
laterally or horizontally) or upper body movement. When people 
talk to him, Deng continues to look straight ahead, and people 
have to either lean in close to him or one of his daughters 
apparently repeats what is said while leaning close to his ear; 
sometimes a daughter speaks to the other person immediately 
after Deng speaks, apparently repeating Deng's response.] 
  This is the seventh consecutive year Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
joined the Shanghai people in marking the Spring Festival since 
1988. 
  The hall was decorated with flowers and imbued with the air 
of spring. In high spirit and in firm strides, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, with a smile, walked toward to the comrades in 
Shanghai and shook their hands cordially one by one. [video 
continues to show medium close-ups of Deng Xiaoping shaking 
hands with well-wishers] 
  Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, 
and Huang Ju, Shanghai mayor, stepped forward to express their 
sincere blessings to Comrade Xiaoping. 
  Comrade Wu Bangguo said: On behalf of the 13 million people 
in Shanghai, I wish you a happy Spring Festival. I wish you 
health and long life; and I wish your whole family happiness. 
[video shows Wu Bangguo talking to Deng, Deng speaking and his 
daughter, her head very close to Deng's left ear, apparently 
repeating Wu's words] 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: I wish leading comrades of the 
central authorities with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core a happy 
Spring Festival and good health. I wish people in the country a 
happy Spring Festival, happy family life, unity, and greater 
victories in the new year. [video shows scenes of Deng walking 
into a room and being greeted by Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju; Deng 
takes very small steps, his daughters have a hand on his back 
and at each elbow, and he looks straight ahead with little or no 
head or upper body movement] 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: I come to Shanghai once a year 
to wish people in Shanghai happy Spring Festival. 
  Comrade Wu Bangguo said: This is your encouragement for 
people in Shanghai. It shows your concern and support for the 
work in Shanghai. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping happily said: You people in Shanghai 
have done a really good job in accomplishing your work. [video 
shows Deng Xiaoping and his wife, Zhuo Lin, having a group 
picture with 18 officials in Shanghai; Deng looks ahead with 
little or no body movement] 
  In Shanghai, Comrade Deng Xiaoping showed great concern for 
Shanghai's material and spiritual construction. He fully 
endorsed the successes the people in Shanghai have accomplished 
over the past year. He said: Shanghai has accomplished its 
work very well. Shanghai has special qualities and characters. 
Shanghai is fully capable of proceeding faster. [video shows a 
car and several vans driving on a large bridge, cutting to show 
Deng, in the company of Wu Bangguo and other Shanghai officials, 
walking slowly on the bridge. Deng is framed by his two 
daughters, walking with very small steps, with little or no head 
and upper body movement] 
  On 13 December, Shanghai was engulfed by grade six chilly 
winds and drizzle. The mercury dropped to about zero degree 
Celcius. On the afternoon of that day, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, 
in the company of Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju, inspected Pudong. 
Despite the winds and the rain, he ascended Yangpu Bridge to 
take a view of the teeming construction projects in Pudong. 
After inspecting the two overpasses -- the Pudong Section and 
the Loshan Road Longyang Road sections of the inner-ring lines 
-- which were completed last year, Comrade Xiaoping [words 
indistinct] and said with a smile: Watching these overpasses 
today is better than reading books for 100 years. He told 
Comrades Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju: These words are from the 
bottom of my heart. [video shows Deng Xiaoping posing for a 
group picture with his daughters on either side of him and some 
Shanghai officials on a bridge, cutting to show Deng shaking 
hands with unidentified officials]. 
  Standing on the magnificent Yangpu Bridge, Comrade Xiaoping, 
holding the hands of Zhu Zhihao, chief commander of the Yangpu 
bridge construction, and praised him, saying: This is a victory 
of the working class in Shanghai. My salute to them. 
  On the eve of New Year's Day, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in the 
company of Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju, ascended to the top floor of 
the New Jinjiang Hotel to look at the brightly illuminated 
Shanghai. He said emotionally: Shanghai has changed. [video 
shows a large van driving in crowded and brightly illuminated 
streets, cutting to show close-ups of Deng shaking hands with 
hotel officials and waving momentarily with small hand motions 
to people in the foyer] 
  When the Chinese and foreign tourists marking the New Year 
Day saw Comrade Deng Xiaoping unexpectedly, they could not help 
giving him a long applause and expressing their respects and 
regards to him. With a smile, Comrade Xiaoping waved to the 
tourists in acknowledgement. Tonight, he also visited the 
congested Nanjing Road and the bund to enjoy the Spring Festival 
with them. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping was very happy when he realized that 
the Dayawan Nuclear Station No. 1 generating unit was 
successfully put into operation. This morning, he asked Comrade 
Li Peng to convey his congratulations and his thanks to the 
builders, scientists, and technicians of the nuclear station.

(2621 4423 3237)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- China successfully 
launched a space survey satellite, the "Practice IV," and a 
simulated satellite with a "Long March IIIA" carrier rocket from 
the Xichang Satellite Launching Center at 1634 [0834 GMT] today. 
According to reports from the Xian Satellite Monitoring and 
Control Center and the "Yuan Wang," a ship engaged in 
astronautics surveying on the Pacific Ocean, the two satellites 
have reached their synchronous orbits and the launch was a 
success. 
  The carrier rocket, "Long March IIIA," is a new type which 
the National Astronautics Industrial Company developed and built 
for launching China's new satellites for telecommunications and 
broadcasting services. The rocket, which is based on the "Long 
March III," has incorporated many advanced technologies and its 
carrying capacity has increased from its previous 1.4 tonnes to 
the present 2.5 tonnes. This was the first time the new rocket 
was used. Experts say that the "Long March IIIA's" successful 
launch shows that the family of Chinese carrier rockets now has 
a new member, and that China's capacity for astronautical 
launching has reached a new level. 
  The Chinese Academy of Sciences Space Center uses the 
"Practice IV" satellite to survey space. The satellite's six 
probes are primarily used to survey the space environment and 
test environmental effects.

<F P=106> [Report by Pan Hongxin (3382 4767 2502), Central People's </F>
Radio Network reporter, and XINHUA reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 
2429)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Feb (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese president and 
chairman of the CPC Central Military Committee, recently met 20 
model citizens from across the country who have staunchly 
supported the tradition of the Army cherishing the people and 
the people supporting the Army. The 20 included Xu Honggang, a 
heroic fighter who gallantly rose to defend a just cause. Jiang 
Zemin said: We must carry forward the fine traditions of our 
party and our armed forces, as well as the traditional virtues 
of the Chinese nation, and make efforts to create a good mood in 
society and promote socialist spiritual civilization. 
  Jiang Zemin, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao and other 
leading comrades met Xu Honggang and other advanced 
representatives before attending a jointly sponsored army-people 
party celebrating the Spring Festival. Zhang Zhen, Chi Haotian, 
Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo and Fu Quanyou were also present. 
  Jiang Zemin praised highly the heroic deeds of Xu Honggang, 
who defied brute force and took up the cudgels on behalf of a 
just cause, as well as the noble conduct of people such as Zhan 
Benfang, who helped rescue and protect soldiers. He said: The 
deeds of Xu Honggang and Zhan Benfang embody the tradition of 
the communist party, of the veteran Red Army, as well as the 
fine tradition of the Army cherishing the people and the people 
supporting the Army, and the traditional virtues of the Chinese 
nation. We must properly publicize the deeds of people like Xu 
Honggang in order to encourage good conduct, maintain social 
unity and stability, and create a favorable social environment 
for reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  Xu Honggang is the squad leader of a communications company 
under the Jinan Military Region. He was seriously injured after 
bravely struggling with gangsters on a bus on 17 August. He was 
rescued by Zhan Benfang, deputy director of a tax department in 
Sichuan's Yulian County. The deeds of Xu Honggang and Zhan 
Benfang and other heroes have been admiringly talked about among 
the people. Xu Honggang and other `double support' models who 
met the leaders said they would bear in mind the exhortations of 
the leaders of the CPC Central Committee in order to do an even 
better job of supporting the Army and giving preferential 
treatment to the families of soldiers and martyrs, and in 
supporting the government and cherishing the people.

  [Text] Brussels, February 9 (XINHUA) -- The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) today warned the Bosnian Serbs that 
they would face air strikes unless they lift their siege of 
Sarajevo within 10 days. 
  NATO said in a statement the strikes would take place 10 
days 
from 2400 GMT Thursday if the ultimatum was not met. 
  Earlier, the United Nations said that the three warring 
parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina had reached a ceasefire agreement 
in and around Sarajevo through the mediation of U.N. 
representatives. 
  The Serbs pledged to withdraw their artillery from around 
the 
city and put the guns under U.N. monitoring. 
  It is reported that NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner 
had immediately informed U.N. chief Butrus Butrus-Ghali of the 
decision made at a meeting of the NATO ambassadors today. 
  Butrus-Ghali had asked NATO to get prepared for air strikes 
following a mortar shelling against an open-market in Sarajevo 
last Saturday that killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200 
others. 
  The NATO statement said the ultimatum was given in close 
cooperation with the U.N. chief.

  [Text] New Delhi, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- Addressing the 
International Children's Health Conference sponsored by the 
World Health Organization here today, Chinese Public Health 
Minister Chen Minzhang said that China reached its target of 
immunizing 85 percent of the children in provinces and counties 
in 1988 and 1990 respectively; now China has placed on its 
agenda the project of immunizing 85 percent of the children in 
townships and annihilating polio by the year 1995. He said 
China is also creating conditions so that immunization against 
hepatitis B can gradually be brought into plan. 
  The three-day meeting will close on 4 February. The 
representatives attending the meeting have exchanged views on 
the progress the world has made in achieving the intermediate 
objectives set for children's development during the 1990's, and 
they will also study and discuss the strategies and measures for 
achieving those objectives faster. 
  Chen Minzhang noted: A populous developing country, China 
has one-fifth of the world's children, and more than 20 million 
babies are born in China each year. Because the level of 
China's economic development remains low and its economic 
foundation is weak, children's health services and actual needs 
in China are still quite far behind the intermediate objectives 
set for the 1990's. China will continue to contribute its share 
to the global objectives by accelerating the process of 
achieving the objectives set for the 1990's.

  [Text] Washington, February 9 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton announced here today that NATO has approved an 
ultimatum on the Bosnian Serbs to remove heavy weapons from 
around Sarajevo and stop shelling the Muslims within 10 days. 
  Speaking at a White House press conference, Clinton said 
NATO 
forces "stand ready" to carry out air strikes against "anyone, 
anyone" who further launch shells. 
  NATO made a similar announcement, with more details, in 
Brussels, Belgium, minutes later. 
  Just before the NATO announcement, the Bosnian Serbs and 
Muslims reached a new ceasefire, on top of the numerous ones 
that failed before. 
  Clinton welcomed the move, hoping the latest ceasefire would 
really hold this time. 
  He said Washington has important interest in seeing the end 
of the Bosnian carnage. 
  Although the situation does not justify U.S. unilateral 
actions, it deserves active U.S. efforts and leadership in 
seeking a diplomatic solution to the conflict and otherwise, 
Clinton said. 
  In response to a question on Russia's opposition to the NATO 
air strikes ultimatum, Clinton said attempts earlier today to 
call President Boris Yeltsin had failed and he would try to talk 
to him later. 
  Clinton said he hopes the Russians would at least 
understand, 
if not agree with, the NATO move. 
  Russia has traditional and historical links with the Serbs 
and Clinton stressed that the NATO threat "applies to anyone, 
not only the Serbs." 
  The President said he was grateful for the support of the 
countries with soldiers in Bosnia, such as France, Britain, 
Canada and Spain.

  [Text] Washington, February 9 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton assured the Americans today that U.S. contribution to 
resolving the Bosnian crisis will be "proportional to our 
interests, no more and no less." 
  Clinton made the remarks while announcing a NATO ultimatum 
that the Bosnian Serbs remove their heavy weapons from around 
Sarajevo and all sides stop shelling one another within 10 days 
or risk NATO air strikes. 
  "If any Bosnian Serb heavy weapons were found within 20 
kilometers of Sarajevo within 10 days, or after 10 days, or if 
there is any further shelling of Sarajevo, NATO commanders stand 
ready to conduct air strikes against Serb artillery positions," 
Clinton said. 
  Clinton's proportionality approach is apparently aimed at 
those who urge a greater U.S. involvement and those who fear the 
U.S. would get embroiled in the conflict. 
  The President said Washington's interests in seeing an end 
to 
the Bosnian crisis include prevention of "a broader conflict in 
Europe," NATO's credibility in post-Cold War Europe, the 
stemming of refugees flowing from Bosnia and humanitarian 
considerations. 
  "These interests don't justify unilateral American 
intervention in the crisis," Clinton said. "But they do justify 
the involvement of America and the exercise of our leadership." 
  He said the U.S. would play a more active role in the 
Bosnian 
negotiations in order to reinvigorate the process of peace and 
bring the sides to an agreement. 
  NATO's ultimatum came after last Saturday's shelling of a 
Sarajevo market which left 68 people dead and nearly 200 others 
wounded, the largest civilian toll since fighting broke out in 
the Balkan republic 22 months ago. 
  In announcing the NATO move, Clinton noted reports that the 
Bosnian Serbs had agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons. 
  "If these reports are true, I welcome them," Clinton said. 
  "We hope that Bosnian Serb action will make air strikes 
unnecessary." 
  As if to counter criticism that past NATO threats had 
evaporated, Clinton emphasized that "no one should doubt NATO's 
resolve. Nato is set to act." 
  In response to a question on Russia's opposition to the NATO 
air strikes ultimatum, Clinton said attempts earlier today to 
call President Boris Yeltsin had failed for technical 
difficulties and he would try to talk to him later. 
  Clinton said he hopes the Russians would at least 
understand, 
if not agree with, the NATO move. 
  Russia has traditional and historical links with the Serbs, 
and Clinton stressed that the NATO threat "applies to anyone, 
not only the Serbs." 
  Clinton stressed, "anyone, anyone shelling Sarajevo must 
recognize this fact (NATO's determination to act) and be 
prepared to deal with the consequences." 
  The president said he was grateful for the support of the 
countries with soldiers in Bosnia, such as France, Britain, 
Canada and Spain.

  [Text] Washington, February 9 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton today hailed an agreement by Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on implementing a 
declaration of principles for Palestinian self-rule on the West 
Bank and in Gaza. 
  "In Cairo, Foreign Minister Peres and Yasir 'Arafat 
announced 
an agreement on self-rule and on the terms of withdrawal from 
Gaza and Jericho," Clinton told the World Jewish Congress. 
  "I think another big milestone has been achieved today," he 
said. 
  The negotiations in Cairo were designed to implement the 
historic accord signed in Washington last September and setting 
December 13, 1993, for the military pullout of Israel, which 
balked at negotiations over details of the plan for weeks. 
  Clinton said that the U.S. approach is to ensure the 
successful implementation of the declaration of principles and 
will show the Israelis that the agreement can not only enhance 
their security but provide a self-government for their 
Palestinian neighbors. 
  Meanwhile, he described the U.S. commitment to maintaining 
and enhancing the security of Israel as "ironclad" and a 
precondition for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. 
  "To achieve our goal of a comprehensive settlement," Clinton 
stressed, "we insist that the Arab boycott of Israel end now."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "China, US Team Up in Drug Control"] </F>
  [Text] China and the United States have agreed to join 
efforts to fight drug trafficking and illegal immigration, 
according to officials of the Ministry of Public Security. 
  The agreement was signed by Bai Jingfu, vice-minister of 
Public Security and vice-director of the National Narcotics 
Control Committee and Robert Gelbard, the US Assistant Secretary 
of State for international narcotics affairs. 
  Through their talks on January 25 in Beijing, Bai and 
Gelbard 
exchanged views on how to solve the international narcotics 
problems, especially the sources in Asia, such as the notorious 
"Golden Triangle." The two sides agreed on the need to 
strengthen their cooperation in fighting drug crimes. The 
Chinese side expressed its hope that the United States would 
remove barriers impeding the two nations from working together 
to stop the international drug trade. Gelbard said the United 
States needs to work out new laws for curbing the increasing 
drug crimes. 
  During his stay in Beijing, Gelbard also held talks with 
Zhang Hongxi, director of the Consular Affairs Department of the 
Foreign Ministry, on illegal immigration. While briefing 
Gelbard on various factors that cause smuggling and illegal 
immigration and the steps China has taken to combat these kinds 
of illegal activities, Zhang reiterated China's opposition to 
such activities. He also asked the United States to clamp down 
on the "snakeheads," who have been found to be involved in 
smuggling Chinese people to the United States. He added that 
while the United States grants asylum to these smugglers who 
falsely claim that they are fleeing political persecution in 
China, it is encouraging such kind of smuggling. 
  Gelbard said his talks with the Chinese officials on both 
problems were satisfactory, and he and his Chinese counterparts' 
opinions on the matter were "very much along the same line." 
  Gelbard also visited China's Fujian, Guangdong and Yunnan 
provinces after leaving Beijing.

  [Text] Yamassoukro, 7 Feb (XINHUA) -- The funeral of the 
late former Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Biogny, who died 
of illness on 7 December last year, was ceremoniously held in 
the Ivorian political capital of Yamassoukro today. 
  The funeral rites were held in a combination of the 
traditional customs of the Baoule people and the ceremony of a 
modern state funeral. In the morning, the "Biogny Peace 
Foundation Building" was filled with solemn silence, with 
Biogny's bronze coffin well placed in the middle of the mourning 
hall where his portrait was hung. At 1100, the cortege left the 
"Peace Foundation Building" for the "Ave Maria Peace Cathedral" 
for a memorial mass. The remains were later buried at the 
Biogny Tomb within the compound of the Presidential Residence. 
  Leaders and special envoys from over 70 countries, and 
representatives of nearly 40 international and regional 
organizations, attended Biogny's funeral. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent a condolence cable. Liu 
Chengguo, vice agriculture minister and special envoy of the 
Chinese Government, was all the way here to attend Biogny's 
funeral. 
  Born to the family of a tribal chief in Yamassoukro on 18 
October 1905, Biogny practiced medicine in his early days and 
was president of the Ivory Coast since its independence on 7 
August 1960. He was a pioneer of the African nationality 
independence movements and an influential senior statesman.

  [Text] Lagos, February 6 (XINHUA) -- "China and Nigeria 
have made a good beginning in the bilateral technical 
cooperation" at the just-concluded consultation on technical 
cooperation among developing countries (TCDC), Chinese 
delegation sources said here today. 
  Huang Zhaohong, who headed the Chinese delegation to the 
meeting, told XINHUA that China has entered into 57 cooperation 
agreements with Nigeria at the five-day forum, which ended last 
Friday [4 February] in the Nigerian capital Abuja. 
  "This is the first time for China to have TCDC agreements 
with Nigeria," said Huang who is also economic and commercial 
counselor in the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria. 
  The Chinese delegation returned to Lagos on Saturday from 
the 
consultation meeting held in Abuja. 
  This is the first international conference held in Nigeria 
since General Sani Abacha came to power last November. 
  In addition, the Chinese delegation also signed seven other 
cooperation agreements with Benin, Cuba, Gambia and Thailand. 
  A total of 280 cooperation agreements were concluded by the 
end of the consultation meeting, which involved 26 developing 
countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America. 
  "The Chinese delegation ranks first in reaching agreements 
with other nations," Huang said. 
  In fact, "We are among the busiest people at the meeting. 
People came to our table for consultation and negotiation 
before they made up their mind" to sign a cooperation agreement 
with the Chinese delegation, said Li Wanming, a woman member of 
the Chinese delegation at the conference. 
  Initiated under the United Nations Development Program 
(UNDP), the TCDC is aimed at promoting cooperation among 
developing countries. 
  China began to take part in the UNDP activities in October 
1972. In September 1979, the UNDP set up a permanent 
representative office in China.

Zambia at a ceremony held in an airforce base near Lusaka. 
  The two China-made aircrafts were sold on credit by China

surely strengthen the capacity of the Air Force, he added. 
  In reply, Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Yang Zengye said in 
line with the principles of equality, mutual benefits, stress on 
practical results, diversity in forms and attainment of common 
progress, China will further promote the existing friendly 
relations of close cooperation with Zambia. 
  The two aircrafts flew here on January 25.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Bosnian Situation at Crucial Point as NATO </F>
Issues Ultimatum"] 
  [Text] Brussels, February 10 (XINHUA) -- As the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) issued an ultimatum on 
Wednesday, and Bosnian Serbs agreed to a truce in Sarajevo, the 
situation in the area was at a crucial point. 
  The NATO's ultimatum late Wednesday gave the Bosinan Serbs 
10 
days beginning 24:00 GMT Thursday to remove their heavy guns 
deployed around Sarajevo, saying if they fail to comply with the 
deadline, their heavy weapons will "be subjected to NATO air 
strikes." 
  In a statement, the NATO also called upon the Government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, within the same period, to place the heavy 
weapons in its possession within the Sarajevo exclusion zone 
under the control of U.N. protection forces, and to refrain from 
attacks launched from within the current confrontation lines in 
the city. 
  The statement said the Bosnian Serbs bear the main 
responsibility for the tragic loss of civilian life that results 
from their siege of Sarajevo. 
  The ultimatum was given after a mortar shelling on a market 
in Sarajevo killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200 others last 
Saturday. The carnage led to renewed calls for NATO air strikes 
against Bosinan Serb artillery positions around Sarajevo. 
  NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner immediately informed 
U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali of the decision made 
at a meeting of the NATO ambassadors. 
  Despite Serb denials of responsibility for the attack on the 
market, Woerner told reporters earlier: "It's time for action. 
We have had enough of words." 
  Following the NATO ultimatum, Woerner said there would be a 
swift allied response if the threat of air strikes against Serbs 
brought retaliation against U.N. forces and other personnel in 
Bosnia. 
  "If there would be an attack on U.N. personnel, then we 
would 
respond firmly, rapidly and ... decisively. We will do 
everything possible," Woerner told a news conference after the 
NATO meeting. 
  President Bill Clinton of the United States, which is an 
important NATO member, warned Bosinan Serbs on Wednesday that 
the ultimatum for the removal of Serb artillery within 21 
kilometers of Sarajevo was no idle threat. 
  "NATO is now set to act, " he said. 
  The United States would participate if NATO launched air 
strikes, he said at a White House news conference, but he 
assured the American public that the United States would not be 
drawn into any major combat role in ex-Yugoslavia. 
  Casting the Bosnian conflict mainly as a European issue, 
Clinton said American involvement would be "proportionate to our 
interests - no more, no less." 
  "We have made it quite clear that this will not involve 
American ground forces," he added. 
  Under the threat of Western air strikes, Bosinan Serbs on 
Wednesday agreed to a Sarajevo truce under the mediation of 
U.N.representatives and pledged to pull back their artillery 
from around Sarajevo and put the heavy guns under U.N. 
monitoring. 
  Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic warned 
against any air raids, saying, "We will shoot down every plane 
we can" if attacked. 
  "In case of an attack, we cannot guarantee safety to any 
foreigner who finds himself on our territory, " he said. 
  In its statement, the NATO also stressed its commitment to 
securing a negotiated settlement of the Bosnian crisis, saying 
the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo could be a step toward the 
placing of Sarajevo under U.N. administration.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 5 Feb (XINHUA) -- According to 
verifications by the Hong Kong Observatory: Since Guangdong's 
Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant started trial production last 
August, to date Hong Kong has found no increase in the quantity 
of radiation. The observatory also predicted that after the 
Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant is officially put into operation, 
the increase in the quantity of radiation in Hong Kong per year 
will be fairly low and will not affect human health. 
  Since the end of last August, the Dayawan Nuclear Power 
Plant 
has started supplying on a trial basis some electricity needed 
in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Observatory set up nuclear 
radiation monitoring posts in 10 areas of Hong Kong, but to date 
has found no signs of an increase in the quantity of radiation. 
Wang Mingsong, chief senior scientist at the observatory, said: 
It is predicted that after the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant is 
put into full operation, the increase in the quantity of 
radiation in Hong Kong will be merely under one-thousandth the 
amount of ordinary radiation exposure in urban areas; this will 
not affect human health. 
  Dai Qianjun, public affairs manager for the Hong Kong 
Nuclear 
Power Investment Corporation, noted: Hong Kong's power plants 
did not increase power generating equipment last year, but Hong 
Kong's demand for electricity is increasing. After it is put 
into operation, the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant can provide 70 
percent of its electricity to Hong Kong, accounting for 17 to 18 
percent of the amount consumed in Hong Kong; this will meet Hong 
Kong's power demands from 1994 to 1995. Moreover, the low 
operating cost will maintain a stable electric rate in Hong Kong 
over the next 20 years.

<F P=106> [By corrrespondent Dong Huifeng (5516 2585 1496) ] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--In a recent 
interview given to a ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE correspondent, Wang 
Qiren, the newly appointed president of the Bank of China, 
thanked people from different Hong Kong and Macao circles for 
their care for him, saying he missed all his Hong Kong and Macao 
friends and he had had a good time with them over the last two 
years. 
  Wang Qiren, who resigned earlier as deputy director of the 
State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said he was 
touched by the massive New Year's greeting cards and letters of 
congratulations he received from his Hong Kong and Macao 
friends. He asked the correspondent to express his regards and 
wish them all a happy new year for him. 
  He said: The important thing in dealing with Hong Kong and 
Macao compatriots is sincerity and serving them well according 
to relevant central policies in order to increase their sense of 
belonging and make them feel that we are all Chinese and Chinese 
government officials are their friends. He said many Hong Kong 
and Macao friends he came in contact with were patriotic and 
loved Hong Kong and Macao, which is the foundation for achieving 
one country, two systems, and maintaining long-term prosperity 
and stability in Hong Kong and Macao. 
  Wang Qiren pointed out that 1997 is only three years away 
and 
there are many specific tasks to do, such as actively 
propagating and popularizing the Basic Law to make it known to 
everybody, working hard to maintain the stability and prosperity 
of Hong Kong's economy, despite Britain's noncooperation, and 
various tasks for Hong Kong's transition toward 1997. This will 
turn the attention of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots to the 
motherland and make them work in concerted effort for the return 
of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland. Only thus can we face 
the 5,000-year civilized Chinese race, history, and our 
descendants with a clear conscience. 
  In the two-and-a-half hour interview, the former State 
Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office deputy director said 
more than once that the Bank of China has a close relationship 
with Hong Kong and Macao; that he will continue to serve Hong 
Kong and Macao compatriots in his work and in his participation 
in the Preliminary Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee 
for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

  [Text] Macao, February 9 (XINHUA) -- Macao Governor 
General Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira said today that he is 
confident in Macao's future. 
  He said in his Lunar New Year message that in a period of 
unrest caused by different religions, races and conflicts, Macao 
is still a place which bears understanding between different 
cultures and a model in dealing with difficulties with peaceful 
attitude. 
  The governor said he is convinced that the planned visit by 
Portuguese premier and the announced visit by Portuguese 
president to the People's Republic of China would be an 
important symbol of maintenance of the mutual understanding and 
friendly cooperation between the two countries. 
  Thus, he continued, "We have sufficient reasons to predict 
that we'll have all conditions that will enable us to work for 
our economic modernization, improving our infrastructural 
construction and implementing localization policies." 
  He hoped that all people would do a good job in the new 
year, 
saying that "Our success will be a powerful contribution to the 
strengthening of friendship between China and Portugal and a 
stable base for the progress of Macao."

  [Text] Macao, February 9 (XINHUA) -- The maintenance of 
Macao's stable development and smooth transition conforms to the 
interests of China, Portugal and local people, Guo Dongpo said 
in his Spring Festival message here today. 
  Guo, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Macao branch, said 
that "In the coming new year, we hope to continue friendly 
cooperation with Portugal Government in firmly implementing the 
Sino-Portuguese joint declaration in convergence with the basic 
law of Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), in a bid to 
properly deal with a series of important issues in the 
transitional period." 
  He pointed out, these issues include the three major 
questions, namely localization of public servants and law and 
officialization of the Chinese language. 
  In handling some key issues, Guo noted, "We hope to, 
together 
with Portugal side, seek proper ways to work out solutions on 
the basis of mutual respect and mutual understanding." 
  He added that this would also be done in line with the 
spirit 
of friendly relationship and cooperation between the governments 
of China and Portugal, and in the view of Macao's long-term 
interest. 
  Guo said, last year, China reported marked progress in a 
series of reforms and overall economic development and the 
living standards of the Chinese people has been improved 
greatly. China's position in the world political structure has 
become more and more important, he said. 
  Guo said, 1993 was also an important year for Macao. In 
March of the year the Eighth National People's Congress adopted 
the basic law of Macao SAR which afforded essential guarantee 
for the smooth transition and long-term stability in the area. 
  He commented that as a result of friendly cooperation 
between 
the governments of China and Portugal, all matters concerning 
the transition in Macao have been going on smoothly. Macao 
compatriots and people from all walks of life are confident 
about the policy of "one country, two systems" and the future of 
Macao, he said. 
  He expressed the hope that Macao compatriots and people from 
all walks of life continue to actively participate in various 
matters in the transitional period and contribute more to the 
prosperity of Macao.

  [Text] The reunification of China should be accomplished 
by peaceful means and on an equal basis, Premier Lien Chan said 
yesterday, urging Beijing's leaders to help achieve what he 
called a historical mission. 
  Premier Lien made the remarks during his year-end news 
conference at the Government Information Office. Lien took 
office in February last year. 
  "The life of a politician is short, but the life of the 
nation is forever," Lien said, asking the mainland leaders to be 
ever mindful of the future development for all of China. 
  If the Chinese Communists continue to take the zero-sum 
approach to debase Taiwan, treating Taiwan as a renegade 
province, then unification of this kind will be called 
"annexation," Lien declared. 
  "The One-China policy is the nation's fundamental policy, 
but 
this China is currently divided," Lien said. "The Republic of 
China is a sovereign nation founded in 1912, but currently the 
ROC rules only reach Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu." 
  Lien added, "Realistically speaking the discussion of the 
sovereignty issue should be put aside at the present stage when 
considering the issues relating to foreign affairs and mainland 
policy." 
  The so-called transitional Two-Chinas policy declared by 
Economics Minister Chiang Pin-kung during the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation summit conference in Seattle last fall was 
not a change of the government's mainland policy but was meant 
only to point out the reality existing between the two sides, 
Lien said. 
  The relationship between Taiwan and mainland are that of 
siblings, not enemies," Lien told some 100 local and foreign 
reporters. "There is no real animosity between Chinese people 
of the two sides, and together we can create a future of 
freedom, security and prosperity." 
  But until Beijing authorities abandon their hostility, 
Taipei 
would not consider opening the so-called "three communications" 
-- direct trade, mail and transportation across the Taiwan 
Strait, the premier indicated. 
  Last December, Economics Minister Chiang said the government 
should lift the ban to allow direct sea links between Taiwan and 
the mainland between certain designated cities and harbors to 
reduce transportation costs. 
  But Lien said yesterday the time is not ripe to deal with 
such a complex issue from a purely economic angle. 
  Beijing will first need to show its sincerity by recognizing 
Taipei as a separate political unit, Renouncing the use of 
military force against Taiwan and halting a campaign to isolate 
Taiwan in the international arena, Lien said. 
  The government will continue to regulate Taiwan investment 
on 
the mainland based on the National Unification Guidelines, 
according to Lien, who said he does not think the economic 
activities should be separated from politics.

<F P=106> [By Pao Chieh-sheng] </F>
  [Text] Washington's decision to lift a decades-old trade 
embargo against communist Vietnam is widely expected to spark a 
wave of direct exports to the United States from Taiwan-owned 
factories in the Southeast Asian country. 
  After the announcement from Washington, sources in the 
shipping industry, which is widely considered to be a barometer 
of international trade, said big orders from U.S. buyers may not 
start coming in before the U.S. government works out final 
clarification regarding tariffs on Vietnamese-made goods. 
  However, some local firms maintaining production lines in 
Vietnam which had been indirectly exporting Vietnamese-made 
goods to the United States by relabeling them in third countries 
will see their costs significantly reduced as a result of the 
U.S. policy shift. 
  International shipping lines are getting ready to handle an 
increasing amount of business from transfers of Vietnamese cargo 
to U.S.-bound ships. 
  "We expect a lot of exports (to the U.S.) now," said one 
official at Evergreen Marine Corp's Taipei office." "This is 
good news for the shipping industry." 
  The lifting of the embargo "will certainly pioneer a lot of 
good opportunities in the shipping industry for all merchants," 
he said. According to the Evergreen official, firms in Vietman 
wanting to ship to U.S. ports will be able to do so right away 
because Evergreen already operates feeder services from Haiphong 
to Kaohsiung and from Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) to Singapore, 
where cargos can now be easily transferred to U.S.-bound ships. 
  "The service was already there, so we can transfer to 
U.S.-bound ships immediately," he said. Most other international 
shippers also have similar Vietnam services, with the notable 
exception being U.S.-owned lines, which are expected to get new 
routes to Vietnamese ports going as soon as possible. 
  The potential for increased exports between Vietnam and the 
United States "is very big," the Evergreen official said. "Just 
like it has been in the mainland." 
  However, conditions at poorly maintained port facilities in 
Vietnam are far from ideal and it may take some time before 
necessary improvements can be made to them, he noted. 
  Another official working at a major foreign shipping 
carrier's Taipei office said he doesn't expect a sudden rush in 
U.S.-Vietnam shipping "because it will still take some time" for 
U.S. companies to work out deals with Vietnamese exporters and 
sign contracts. 
  Authorities in the United States still need to make some 
important decisions regarding tariffs on imported goods from 
Vietnam, he said, so American importers will probably wait to 
see if Vietnam gets the United States' most-favored-nation trade 
status or other special trade privileges before making any large 
orders. 
  It could take about nine months to one year before-direct 
U.S.-Vietnam trade really starts to develop, he said. 
  Meanwhile, "trade between Vietnam and its Asian neighbors is 
already flourishing" so the lifting of the embargo probably 
won't have much of an effect on outbound shipments there, at 
least for the short term, he said. 
  However, American shippers which now can book loads in 
Vietnam might experience an increase in inter-Asian business, he 
said. 
  According to ROC [Republic of China] government estimates, 
Taiwan is Vietnam's No. 1 source of foreign investment capital, 
with more than US$1.5 billion invested to date, mostly in 
low-end, labor-intensive production lines based in the southern 
part of the country. 
  Many of these investments were made by local entrepreneurs 
in 
the hopes that the U.S. would soon lift its embargo against its 
former war-time enemy.

<F P=106> ["Provincial Government Carries Out Practical Tasks, Sets 26 </F>
More New Tasks for This Year After Basically Completing 26 Tasks 
Last Year" -- XINHUA RIBAO headline] 
  [Excerpts] Thanks to concerted efforts and solid work 
throughout the province, 24 of the 26 key practical tasks 
designated for 1993 by the provincial people's government have 
been completed or basically completed; the remaining two tasks 
have been partially completed after appropriate adjustments were 
made in a realistic spirit. [passage omitted] 
  To strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the national 
economy, the provincial government, in carrying out the 
practical tasks, focused on speeding up the construction of 
water conservancy projects and developing agriculture in an 
all-around way. [passage omitted] 
  Smooth progress was made in forming joint stock enterprises 
and enterprise groups as a way to establish a socialist market 
economic system, and to speed up reform and opening up. Across 
the province, six limited liability stock companies which raised 
funds from society had their stocks listed; 104 limited 
liability stock companies which raised funds from specific 
sources, and 600 limited liability companies were established. 
The stock cooperative system was implemented in 9,500 
enterprises, including city and town collectively owned 
enterprises, as well as village and town enterprises, and 108 
provincial-level enterprise groups were formed. The pace of 
market construction quickened, resulting in the establishment of 
63 markets for production factors, 138 markets for the means of 
production, and 250 wholesale markets for agricultural, 
sideline, and industrial products across the province. Six of 
these markets registered a business volume of more than 1 
billion yuan. Ten provincial-level, wholesale commodity markets 
were established, overfulfilling the task by 100 percent. 
Progress was made in encouraging foreign-funded or 
joint-venture banks to set up branches in Jiangsu. Changzhou 
and Huiyin cities carried out experiments in balance sheet ratio 
management. The export-oriented economy maintained vigorous 
growth, taking in $5.97 billion in export-generated foreign 
exchange for the entire year. A total of 10,248 new wholly or 
partly foreign-owned enterprises were approved, $2.84 billion in 
foreign capital was actually put to use, $330 million worth of 
new labor service contracts were signed, and $260 million worth 
of business was conducted, all of which represent an 
overfulfillment of relevant tasks. A total of 210 overseas 
nontrading enterprises were organized, which means 130 percent 
of the plan was completed. 
  Significant progress was made in infrastructure 
construction, 
such as transportation, energy, and communications, to solve 
"bottlenecks" in the province's economic development. 
Preliminary work on the new Nanjing Airport was basically 
completed, and the annual tasks regarding land requisition, 
demolition, and relocation were completed. Remodeling and 
expansion projects at the Xuzhou and Yancheng Airports were 
completed satisfactorily. The Jiangsu Airlines opened new 
routes to Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. The work 
of land requisition, demolition, and relocation along the entire 
Shanghai-Nanjing expressway was completed, and the annual plan 
for roadbed earthwork and stonework, culverts, and bridges was 
fulfilled. Preparations for the initial stage of the Jiangyin 
Changjiang Bridge proceeded smoothly. [passage omitted] 
  Satisfactory results were achieved in key scientific and 
technological projects, new product development, and major 
technical transformation projects. Good progress was made in 20 
key scientific and technological projects, some of which yielded 
positive results. The tasks to implement 166 projects at or 
above the provincial-level under the Torch Program, as well as 
to verify 181 new and high-technology enterprises and 3,000 
provincial-level new scientific and technological products, were 
overfulfilled. Smooth progress was made in 10 key industrial 
experimental projects, and the plans for launching 100 major 
projects to develop new products and 100 key technical 
transformation projects were either fulfilled or overfulfilled. 
Four of the 10 engineering research centers and intermediate 
testing bases were inspected and accepted by the authorities. 
Second-stage construction tasks for 12 demonstration bases 
engaged in comprehensive agricultural experiments are proceeding 
smoothly according to contracts. Work commenced on all 107 
science and technology demonstration townships and towns, which 
are still under construction. 
  Along with faster progress in promoting socialist material 
civilization, the practical task of promoting socialist 
spiritual civilization also yielded positive results. Nine-year 
compulsory education was extensively implemented in 28 counties 
(cities and districts) and in 420 townships and towns. [passage 
omitted] 
  To implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Seventh (Enlarged) 
Plenary Session of the Eighth Jiangsu Provincial Party 
Committee, and further promote economic development and social 
stability, the provincial government has decided, after 
conducting relevant studies, to concentrate on carrying out the 
following 26 practical tasks in 1994: 
  1. To continue to speed up the construction of water 
conservancy projects. [passage omitted] 
  2. To support the construction of counties (cities) into 
commodity grain, fine-quality cotton production bases, and to 
establish demonstration zones for high-quality, high-yield, and 
high-efficiency agriculture. [passage omitted] 
  3. To raise the per capita income of peasants across the 
province by 150 yuan, increase the per capita income of peasants 
from diversified production in Huaibei and three other cities by 
80 yuan, and establish 30 leading enterprises for processing 
agricultural and sideline products through integrated trade, 
industry, agriculture, production, supply, and marketing. 
[passage omitted] 
  4. To establish provincial-level imported seed quarantine 
zones and specialized seed markets, and achieve a 60-percent 
rate in seed supply for the province's major farm crops. 
[passage omitted] 
  5. To basically complete work to designate primary farmland 
protection zones across the province. [passage omitted] 
  6. To increase the proportion of state-owned large and 
medium 
enterprises experimenting with the shareholding system in the 
province to 20 percent, select 100 large and medium enterprises 
and reorganize them into limited liability stock companies that 
raise funds from specific sources, and select a few experimental 
enterprises and allow them to issue stocks to the public and 
list stocks for trading on the market within the 
state-prescribed scope of stock issues. 
  7. To vigorously cultivate and develop markets. [passage 
omitted] 
  8. To actively encourage the development of individually and 
privately run enterprises. [passage omitted] 
  9. To encourage the establishment of a couple of 
foreign-funded banks, ask state commercial banks to set up two 
or three provincial-level branches in Jiangsu, and form the 
Jiangsu Life Insurance Company. [passage omitted] 
  10. To bring in more than $7 billion in export-generated 
foreign exchange for the province, set up 8,000 "wholly or

  [Text] Shanghai, 9 Feb (XINHUA) -- Wu Bangguo, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the 
Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju 
today extended Spring Festival greetings to Comrade Chen Yun in 
Shanghai, wishing him happiness, health, and longevity. 
  Comrade Chen Yun happily received the Shanghai comrades and 
had cordial conversations with them. 
  Wu Bangguo reported to Comrade Chen Yun on the work Shanghai 
did last year in launching reforms, opening up to the outside 
world, developing the economy, and maintaining social stability, 
as well as what Shanghai plans to do this year. Comrade Chen 
Yun was very satisfied with the report. He said: Shanghai has 
done a good job, not just good, but very good. 
  Comrade Chen Yun said: Since the Third Plenary Session of 
the 13th CPC Central Committee in 1978, the nation's economy has 
developed very quickly and the people's living standards have 
improved greatly. This is a fact everybody can see. Of course, 
there are still many difficulties and problems. To solve these 
difficulties and problems, it is necessary to first safeguard 
and strengthen the authority of the party Central Committee with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. Without the authority of the 
party Central Committee, there will be no major accomplishments, 
and social stability cannot be maintained. 
  Comrade Chen Yun said: The party Central Committee has 
decided to implement the revenue-sharing system this year so 
that central authorities can gradually pool together the 
necessary financial resources. Shanghai and other localities 
have agreed to this. This shows that you have taken the 
interests of all into consideration. I am very pleased about 
this. 
  Comrade Chen Yun said: The situation of the entire country 
shows that in current economic work, we should pay particular 
attention to one issue, namely the size of our construction 
projects must be compatible with the national strength. In 
addition, there should be some leeway to maneuver. Meanwhile, 
we should focus our attention on achieving higher economic 
efficiency. 
  Comrade Chen Yun stressed: The current central leading body 
is a strong and capable one, and has done a good job. People 
throughout the country must work with one heart and one mind, 
unite as one, and fully implement the series of policies and 
measures adopted by the party Central Committee and the State 
Council for carrying out macroeconomic regulation and control. 
There is great hope for China to boost its economic 
development, and a bright future for socialist China.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Shao Ling (6730 7227)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 6 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- After a 
lackluster 40 years, the Bund -- Shanghai's financial and 
commercial hub -- is again shining and garnering the world's 
attention. David Clinton, brother [as received] of U.S. 
President Clinton, said earlier after a visit to Shanghai: 
"Shanghai is a charming metropolis; no wonder so many American 
firms and enterprises are investing in Shanghai or seeking 
cooperation with it." German Chancellor Kohl, who visited 
Shanghai recently, predicted that Shanghai was going to one of 
the world's noted cities. 
  Foreigners' praises of Shanghai are not unfounded. In the 
last few years, the Shanghai Bund and Puxi District have 
established 10 great exchanges in securities, metals, coal, 
agricultural materials, petroleum, the chemical industry, grains 
and oil-bearing crops, automobiles, building materials, and 
technology -- rapidly turning Shanghai from a regional into a 
national market, which saw a total turnover of 1 trillion yuan 
in 1993. In the newly developed Pudong District, called by West 
Germans the "world's largest work site," hundreds of buildings 
have sprouted up over two or three years, turning Pudong into a 
new industrial district in Shanghai. 
  Shanghai authorities have decided to make six major moves in 
financial structural reforms this year: First, to vigorously 
foster and develop a financial market system, with emphasis on 
the foreign exchange, currency, gold, securities, and insurance 
markets. Second, to push ahead with efforts to commercialize 
banks so as to allow the separation of policy-dictated questions 
from commercial financial affairs in the four great specialized 
banks, and to steadily pursue an asset-liability ratio and risk 
management. Third, to continue expanding the opening up of 
financial institutions and the introduction of more foreign 
counterparts. There are now in Shanghai 26 foreign banks from 11 
countries or regions, most of them making profits. This year 
Shanghai will try to attract more investment from foreign 
financial institutions. Fourth, to continuously expand both the 
scope and the range of financial businesses. This year will see 
the starting of off-shore loan business, home mortgaging, and so 
on. Fifth, to accelerate progress toward electronic finance; 
build a Shanghai credit card network, so that one credit card 
will be good throughout the city; and meanwhile, to put the bill 
clearing and exchange system on an electronic footing. Sixth, 
the make the People's Bank function as a Central Bank, thus 
strengthening macroregulation and control. 
  These moves undoubtedly will turn Shanghai into a national 
financial center. Mao Yingliang, director of the Shanghai 
People's Bank, stated that apart from functioning as a national 
foreign exchange swap center, the Shanghai Securities Exchange 
now has been confirmed in its status as a national center; 
meanwhile it also is becoming a national capital and monetary 
discount center, rapidly moving marketization. 
  The most noteworthy thing is that the Shanghai municipal 
authorities are preparing a series of moves to rebuild the bund 
into a financial thoroughfare. In old times, the Shanghai Bund 
used to be a financial center. The 112 tall bank buildings are 
still there. Many of them used to be quite famous in the Far 
East and world, such as the cluster of buildings characterized 
by the American Bank and Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank buildings, 
which had been dubbed an "expo on modern architecture." Owing 
to political changes, starting from the 1950's, some of these 
bank buildings were turned into government offices or 
residential buildings, schools, or factories. To regain the 
Bund's erstwhile status as a financial center, the authorities 
have decided to restore those buildings still meeting the basic 
needs of financial institutions to their former roles. According 
to reports, the Shanghai Municipal Government building in the 
Bund, which used to house the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, 
recently has been put up for sale by open bidding, with a 
minimum price of $150 million, which has attracted the interest 
of many big domestic and foreign banks. The Hong Kong and 
Shanghai Bank has submitted its price offer. The highest bidder 
reportedly is a certain mainland bank. 
  It seems that Shanghai is on its way to becoming a New York 
Wall Street. As the Shanghai Municipality's leading role in 
China's economic development increases, the rebuilding of the 
Shanghai Bund into a financial center becomes increasingly 
urgent.

<F P=106> [By reporter Qin Hengji (4440 1854 7535): "Huang Ju Pointed </F>
Out at a Shanghai Municipal Financial Work Meeting That 
Financial Reform Will Spearhead Other Reform and Construction 
Programs This Year"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju said that 
financial reform will spearhead various reform measures to be 
carried out in China this year. Shanghai's economic and urban 
construction as well as social development will enter an 
important phase in 1994 with more emphasis being laid on the 
financial front. 
  Huang Ju passed on these remarks when he addressed the 
Shanghai municipal financial work meeting yesterday. In his 
speech, Huang Ju fully affirmed results achieved by the 
financial system. [passage omitted] 
  On work to be carried out in 1994, Huang Ju said: Various 
reform and construction programs to be carried out in Shanghai 
this year will be very arduous; their implementation will depend 
on the financial circles' support. He forwarded four demands to 
Shanghai's financial system: 
  First, it is necessary to conscientiously study Volume Three 
of "The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," thoroughly understand 
its spirit and substance, unify thinking and understanding, and 
make efforts to create a new socialist financial situation under 
which financial departments will be charged with the 
responsibility of exercising macroeconomic regulation and 
control. Second, it is necessary to firmly implement the 
state's monetary policy by placing total credit volumes under 
strict control. Shanghai must foster the concept of taking the 
whole nation as a chess game and resolutely carry out the 
central authorities' policies. On the premise of placing total 
credit volumes under strict control, various financial 
organizations should intensify fund-raising and financing, 
broaden sources of both credits and funds, strengthen funds 
deployment, speed up cash flow, and gradually enhance and 
improve the ability to flexibly exercise macroeconomic 
regulation and control. Besides, Shanghai's financial 
departments should contribute to economic restructuring by 
stepping up research on enterprise reform and the creation of a 
new enterprise system. Third, on the basis of correctly 
handling relations among reform, development, and stability, 
Shanghai's financial circles should grasp the opportunity to 
actively and steadily promote financial reform and opening up. 
Fourth, we should persist in maintaining the high quality of 
financial personnel. Leaders at various levels should attach 
greater importance to fighting corruption and building a 
management system, prevent and curb economic crimes, and uphold 
the principle of "fostering both material progress and cultural 
and ideological progress" by strengthening the building of 
spiritual civilization within the financial system. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [By unidentified staff commentator: "Further Emancipate the </F>
Mind"] 
  [Text] The year of 1994 is a year for tackling key aspects 
of China's reform, as well as a decisive year for Shanghai to 
"bring about great changes in three years." The Second Plenary 
Session of the Sixth Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee held 
before the New Year sounded a clarion call to quicken reform and 
development, and make efforts to create new prospects for 
Shanghai's work, under the guidance of the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. To create new 
prospects, all party members must further emancipate their 
minds. This is the prerequisite for opening up new prospects. 
  Emancipating the mind is the prerequisite for developing our 
undertakings. During the past 15 years, it was precisely 
because we followed the ideological line of "emancipating the 
mind and seeking truth from facts" that we were able to travel 
on the bumpy but successful road of exploration. Since the 
beginning of the 1990's, Shanghai has enjoyed sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic development, and its urban outlook has 
undergone changes with each passing day. This is basically 
because Comrade Xiaoping's talks in Shanghai and in the south 
have greatly emancipated our minds. There are no limits to 
emancipating the mind. From the viewpoint of epistemology, 
human beings continuously deepen their ideology and knowledge in 
the course of practice; therefore, the process of emancipating 
the mind should be a continuous one. Especially when faced with 
such profound social changes as brought about by reform, opening 
up, and modernization, we cannot emancipate our minds, renew our 
concepts, and achieve a leap in the cognitive process in only 
one move. Practice has made it clear to us that only when we 
reach a new level in emancipating our minds, can we create new 
prospects for reform and development. Without the continuous 
emancipation of the mind, the incessant development of 
undertakings is impossible. Remaining where we are and confining 
ourselves within the narrow bounds of our experience because of 
the thinking that "we have done almost everything to emancipate 
our minds" will only bring about backwardness. 
  To further emancipate the mind is a demand put forward to us 
by the situation. In the New Year, Shanghai should aim even 
higher in economic development, and the key to this lies in 
developing new ways of thinking on reform and opening up. 
Shanghai must make grand plans for scoring major achievements, 
and the key lies in showing foresight and operating from a 
strategically advantageous position. To this end, we need to 
further emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, persist in 
proceeding from reality, accommodate changes in the situation, 
seize the opportunities of the times, catch up with the world's 
development, and eliminate metaphysics arising from dogmatism 
and the narrow boundaries of experience. In this new year, in 
particular, the focus of tackling key aspects of reform is 
shifting from destruction to construction, from individual 
projects to package reform, from shallow microeconomic activity 
to profound macroeconomic activity, and from simply "delegating 
powers and allowing enterprises to retain profits" to 
readjusting interests. To Shanghai, a city that wants to be the 
first to establish socialist market economic operating 
mechanisms, this shift of focus provides both an impetus and a 
driving force. It also compels Shanghai, where the planned 
economy has historically been the most complete, to further 
transform its ways of thinking, to further change its norms of 
conduct, and to further adjust the structure of interests. It 
also requires us not only to liberate ourselves from the old 
system and outdated ideas, but also to get rid of our 
superficial understanding of the market economy and nostalgia 
for certain interest structures formed in the course of reform 
in the past. In a word, only when leading cadres at all levels 
further emancipate their minds can they take the initiative in 
seizing opportunities, taking on challenges, and standing in the 
forefront of reform and opening up. 
  To further emancipate our minds, we must oppose arrogance 
and 
shatter complacency. We should be modest and prudent, and 
continue to make progress. In recent years, Shanghai has scored 
certain achievements in its work. Achievements are both burdens 
and tests. Faced with these achievements, we must remain 
level-headed and should never forget how these achievements were 
attained and become complacent. To oppose arrogance, we must 
shatter complacency. Some comrades have become arrogant because 
they tend to be complacent. They do compare themselves with 
others, but they use the wrong yardstick. They always compare 
with others vertically, are content with comparing among 
themselves, and feel complacent after comparing present and past 
achievements. We should not be content with comparing our 
achievements vertically. We must compare our work with the 
demands of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and 
Comrade Xiaoping and other revolutionaries of the older 
generation. We should compare Shanghai with fraternal provinces 
and municipalities, and live up to the expectations of people 
across the municipality. As a leader of opening up to the 
outside world, Shanghai should compare itself with the advanced 
international standards and with the international status of 
other metropolises. After comparing with others in this way, we 
will be able to determine where we lag behind others and where 
we feel inadequate. We should do all we can to catch up and 
surpass others to create new prospects. 
  To further emancipate the minds, it is necessary to persist 
in promoting Shanghai's reform, opening up, and modernization 
drive to a high standard and high level. To attain such a high 
standard and high level, we cannot be satisfied with the 
existing scale and state; we must play the role as "a leader of 
the Chang Jiang valley" and "a financial, trade, and shipping 
center" to serve the whole country, face the world, and 
participate in international competition. The emphasis of 
enterprise reorganization in Shanghai must be laid on the 
organization and establishment of large groups in order to 
innovate enterprise system and join international competition. 
The goal of cultivating markets in Shanghai should be the 
construction of large markets, which should be standardized and 
systematized in line with international practice at a faster 
pace. Shanghai's markets should be constructed to meet the 
needs of the 21st century and break new paths in accordance with 
the criteria of international metropolises. As for the 
renovation of Shanghai's central area, efforts must be 
concentrated in primarily making plans and well constructing the 
central commercial district to meet the standards for an 
international economic, banking, and trading center, so that 
Shanghai will become a center where thousands of merchants 
gather in droves. In short, Shanghai must have a higher level 
in economic development and its municipal construction must have 
a higher standard. Shanghai must advance ahead of others one 
step further and one level higher in reform and opening up. The 
key to upholding a high standard and high level lies in 
maintaining a high ideological level -- this requires us to 
further emancipate our minds, foster lofty ideas, set high 
goals, overcome the influence of the "small workshop, kids 
stuff, and small abacus" thinking stemming from the practice of 
a unified planned economy and closing the country to 
international intercourses for a long time in history, so that 
we can open up a new page with high standard and high level. 
  To further emancipate the minds, it is necessary to overcome 
the word "fear" and work creatively. Presently, the initiative 
and creativity of cadres are more important than anything else 
if Shanghai is to open up a new page in its work, come up with 
new ideas in economic development, and take the lead in reform 
and opening up. The demonstration of initiative and creativity 
means, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping put it, "it requires courage to 
overcome the fear" as well as "further emancipating the minds, 
be bolder, and accelerating the pace." Some of our comrades 
have enough staidness and some to spare, but are lacking in 
initiative. Why? It is fear -- fear of taking risks, fear of 
being the "first one," fear of making mistakes in the course of 
groping, and fear of losing some vested interests in the course 
of reform. If we are afraid of this, afraid of that, how can we 
take the lead in establishing an operating mechanism of 
socialist market economy in Shanghai? We are now in the process 
of changing from a planned economy to a socialist market 
economy, and we should be brave in reforming and eradicating the 
things in the old system which have been proven by practice to 
be unsuitable or will hinder economic development. Because the 
new system of the socialist market economy is an unprecedented 
innovation and there is no existing experience to copy from, we 
need to be even braver in practicing and innovating, as well as 
bringing out the initiative and creativity of cadres. We 
should, in the final analysis, adhere to the criterion of 
"conducive to three causes" [conducive to developing the 
productive forces of our socialist society, increasing the 
overall strength of our socialist country, and improving the 
people's living standards] proposed by Comrade Xiaoping and 
judge the success and failure of all exploration, as well as the 
rights and wrongs of all experiments according to this 
criterion. We should be bold in blazing new trails and trying 
new things. If we are sure of something, we should be bold to 
do it; if we are not so sure, we should allow experiments, which 
should be continued if they are proven right or corrected if 
wrong. Cadres at all levels should have such a daring and 
courage and party organizations at all levels should 
unswervingly adhere to the criterion of "conducive to three 
causes" to protect and bring out the initiative and creativity 
of cadres. It is not easy to inspire cadres' initiative, but it 
is easy to dampen it. Therefore, we should support cadres in 
blazing new trails and trying new things, keeping in mind that 
there is no need to be afraid of making mistakes and that if 
they do make mistakes, it will be all right if they correct 
them. We should allow errors in groping for reform, but we do 
not permit inaction, no daring, and no exploration. To cadres 
who are courageous to try and innovate and have made some 
achievements in opening up a new prospect, we should still 
support and protect them with full enthusiasm even if they have 
made mistakes, provided that they mean to serve the interests of 
the people and seek no personal gains. Only by firmly taking 
the criterion of "conducive to three causes" as a yardstick for 
judging success and failure as well as rights and wrongs, and 
doubling our affection and support for cadres willing to take 
the responsibility and daring to break new paths can we make 
initiative and creativity common practice in the ranks of cadres. 
  China's reofrm will enter a new stage of development in 1994 
-- a year of crucial importance to Shanghai. Shanghainese are 
shouldering a glorious mission and Shanghai's leading cadres at 
various levels are undertaking heavy responsibilities. Let us 
lead all citizens to achieve the goal of "bringing about a great 
change in three years" with the brand-new spirit and appearance 
of emancipating the minds, having courage in forging ahead, 
taking the interests of the whole into account, changing work 
style, forming close ties with the masses, working diligently, 
and assuming a practical attitude!

<F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 </F>
1696 1627) in Beijing: "The Central Authorities' New 
`20-Character' Guiding Principle"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Feb (WEN WEI PO)--A few days ago, CPC 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin, on behalf of the CPC Central 
Committee, formally put forward the 20-character principle for 
the overall situation which clearly demonstrated the work focus 
for this year. The 20-character principle is to: "Seize the 
opportunity (zhua zhu ji yu 2119 0145 2623 6657), deepen the 
reform (shen hua gai ge 3234 0553 2395 7245), open up wider (kuo 
da kai fang 2368 1129 7030 2397), promote development (cu jin fa 
zhan 0191 6651 4099 1455), and maintain stability (bao chi wen 
ding 0202 2170 4489 1353)." This principle is aimed at solving 
the problem of the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability from the high plane of understanding and practice. 
<H3>  It Is Necessary To Properly Handle the Relationship Between 
the Three </H3>
  As far as this reporter knows, the senior leadership of the 
CPC Central Committee hold that the relationship between reform, 
development, and stability should be as follows: Reform is the 
motive force of development, development is the goal of reform, 
and stability is the prerequisite for, and guarantee of, reform 
and fulfillment of the goal. As long as we can properly handle 
the relationship between the three, the construction of the 
entire national economy can take on the normal path of 
"sustained, rapid, and healthy development (chi xu kuai su jian 
kang fa zhan 2170 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455)." 
  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee held last year, two kinds of completely different 
understanding on a large number of reform measures introduced 
all at once by the central authorities in 1994, which are 
vigorous and profound and have great impact, have existed in 
society: First, some people are doubtful of the full-scale 
reform implemented in 1994: Are the conditions ripe? Have we 
been really thoughtful? Have we made full preparations for it? 
Second, others consider it as the coming of another chance for 
high-speed development. This situation has attracted great 
attention from the senior leadership. 
  According to authoritative sources, when discussing the 
major 
reform measures introduced in 1994, all members of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau unanimously held that 1994 
was a rare and probably the best opportunity. Their reply to 
people who are doubtful of the measures was: There is a risk in 
reform but we do not fear it because we have made full 
preparations. Viewed from the angle of the senior leadership, 
what they describe as full preparations come from two sides: 
First, the whole macroscopic environment has created conditions 
for promoting reform. These conditions include the 
establishment of Deng Xiaoping's ideological theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the macroscopic economic 
environment, the experience drawn from reform and opening up 
over the past 15 years, the establishment of the new system of 
socialist market economy advocated by the CPC Central Committee, 
and the extensive support of the masses given to the overall 
framework of the socialist market economy. Second, the reform 
measures introduced have been repeatedly expounded and proved. 
<H5>  The Reform Package Is More Mature </H5>
  The authoritative sources said: From last May onwards, Jiang 
Zemin has been personally in command of the design of the reform 
package and the whole process was divided into two parts. The 
first part was mainly handled by intellectuals who studied the 
issue from the angle of theoretical knowledge; whereas the 
second part was mainly handled by leading cadres with experience 
in practice who approached the issue from practical work 
experience. In this way, personnel in charge of the two parts 
repeatedly studied the issue. During this period, hundreds of 
meetings, ranging from professional meetings, to CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau meetings, and even to Political 
Bureau Standing Committee meetings were held. At last, the 
package was submitted to the Third Plenary Session for approval. 
Hence, the reform package is more mature after long 
deliberation. As commented by a senior leader: We must be 
resolute when we have to, we should never hesitate, and we must 
strive to make a major breakthrough within two to three years. 
We can turn back and deal with minor problems after the major 
problems of the system have been solved. In this way, we can 
create conditions for development. 
<H5>  The Scale of Capital Construction Cannot Be Expanded </H5>
  To reform, it is necessary to take risks and to develop, it 
is necessary to care about conditions. Obviously, the central 
authorities are critical of the trend of blindly seeking rapid 
development. Hence, the central authorities call for "promoting 
development" instead of "accelerating development." As far as 
the senior leadership is concerned, the 13 percent growth for 
two consecutive years is a very high pace of development and 
there will be greater risks in reform if we further accelerate 
the pace of development, apart from strengthening reform, in 
1994. For example, the present high level of capital 
construction, which has reached 1.2 trillion yuan, is unlikely 
to scale down. If the central authorities further lay stress on 
accelerating development, it will heighten the scale of capital 
construction and will definitely trigger off high inflation, 
thus causing great problems in reform or even falling short of 
success for lack of a final effort. Hence, the senior 
leadership of the central authorities insist on a "soft landing" 
for economic development this year and keep reaffirming the 
necessity to guard against overheated economic development and 
to impose strict control on the scale of capital construction. 
The central authorities are calling for development, step by 
step, in a down-to-earth manner. 
<H3>  Li Peng Granted 100 Million Yuan in Allowances for 
Undergraduates </H3>
  Stability is the prerequisite of reform and development. 
Over the past few years, the senior leadership of the central 
authorities has always placed stability in an extremely 
important position and have strived to maintain political and 
social stability and stable popular support to create a less 
restricted environment for reform and to lay a good foundation 
for development. In order to maintain stability, the central 
authorities paid close attention to every issue, ranging from 
big issues such as interstate relations to small ones such as 
whether or not primary and secondary school students and 
undergraduates had enough to eat. It has been learned that due 
to commodity price rises caused by high-speed economic growth 
last year, undergraduates from the hinterland did not have 
enough to eat even though each of them was granted 100 yuan in 
food allowance. Unlike their schoolmates from coastal provinces, 
undergraduates from the hinterland do not have well-to-do 
families to support them. In order to solve these students' 
living problems and to stabilize their mood for learning, State 
Council Premier Li Peng personally granted 100 million yuan to 
the State Education Commission as special funds for subsidizing 
students who did not have enough to eat. 
  The authoritative sources said: Decisionmakers at the 
central level hold that although economic development problems 
arose in 1993, it was still a brilliant year. In 1994, the 
overall economy still maintains a very good development trend. 
In order to maintain this trend, decisionmakers at the central 
level urge everyone throughout the country, when doing all kinds 
of work, to be subordinated to the 20-character principle 
extracted from the experiences and lessons of 1993.

Market for Production Factors -- Ma Kai, Vice Minister of State 
Commission for Restructuring Economy, Answers RENMIN RIBAO 
Reporter's Questions"; place, date not given] 
  [Text] [Reporter] The "decision" of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th party congress has made it clear that in 
cultivating a market system, emphasis must be placed on 
developing the market for production factors. Will you please 
explain why? 
  [Ma Kai] Allowing production factors to circulate in the 
market is an essential requirement and a necessary condition for 
giving the market mechanism a fundamental role in the allocation 
of resources. When the commodity market system has developed to 
a certain extent, the accelerated development of the market for 
production factors becomes an urgent need for developing the 
socialist market economy. 
  [Reporter] What fields do you think we should pay special 
attention to at the present stage of developing the production 
factors market? 
  [Ma] Of the market system for production factors, the most 
important are the markets for funds, land, and labor. In 
addition, there are markets for technology, information, and 
property rights. Land is a kind of rare and nonrenewable natural 
resource, while labor is the most dynamic and active factor 
among the productive forces, and the two are the most basic 
production factors, as well. Under the market economy as a money 
economy, funds are the most important resource. The circulation 
of all important factors -- including banknotes, funds, land, 
and labor, as well as the supply of banknotes and funds -- is 
essential to operation of the market economy as a whole, while 
the financial market is the hub of the entire market system. 
Therefore, to develop the market for production factors, it is 
necessary to focus on developing the financial, land, and labor 
markets first and the markets for technology, information, and 
property rights later. 
  [Reporter] Would you mind giving an account of the present 
state of China's financial market, and plans for financial 
reforms for the next stage? 
  [Ma] Before the reform, China basically had only unitary 
bank 
credit [dan yi yin hang xin yong 0830 0001 6892 5887 0207 3938], 
and introduced the planned allocation of funds and planned 
deposits and loans. Under the planned economy, the bank was a 
subsidiary body to the treasury and could hardly play a role in 
financing. After the reform, however, China's financial system 
and its operating system underwent a change, and a financial 
market began to take shape, but all this has a long way to go to 
meet the demands of a socialist market economy, the main 
problems being the insufficient development of the financial 
market and a lack of effective supervision. 
  The basic goal of cultivating and perfecting the financial 
market is to form a unified, open, competitive, orderly, and 
strictly managed financial market system. To this end, we must 
fulfill the following specific tasks: 
  First, the money market should develop standard inter-bank 
lending so as to turn it into a real money market; it should 
promote the development of the bill market and vigorously 
develop the bill discount; and it should carry out energetic and 
prudent reform of the interest rate formation mechanism so as to 
gradually form a market interest rate system based on central 
bank interest rate, a system under which the interest rate will 
change in accordance with the supply and demand of the funds in 
the market. 
  Second, we must develop stock and bond markets 
enthusiastically and prudently. It is necessary to improve the 
market for government bonds and to enact laws to stop the 
treasury borrowing money from the Central Bank. Financial 
deficits must be covered by issuing government bonds. 
Policy-lending banks should be allowed to issue financial 
bonds. National commercial banks should be allowed to take out 
a mortgage on government or financial bonds from the central 
bank, and other financial institutions also should be allowed to 
take out a mortgage on government and financial bonds from the 
banks other than the central bank in order to create conditions 
for the Central Bank to set up an open market for funds. It is 
essential to improve the stock market and to create conditions 
for establishing unified markets for corporate, individual, A, 
and B shares. 
  [Reporter] What will the labor market be like and how will 
it 
be set up? 
  [Ma] The new labor market will be a market in which free 
labor mobility is allowed; wages are determined mainly by labor 
productivity, as well as the supply and demand for labor in the 
labor market; and the market mechanism plays a fundamental role 
in resource allocation. To this end, we should take the 
following specific measures: 
  1. Speed up reform of the employment system and of the 
job-assignment system for graduates, and set up a public service 
system. The state no longer will be the main employer, 
enterprises will be granted autonomy in hiring workers, and 
workers are allowed to choose their jobs so as to form an 
employment mechanism for the two-way choice between employing 
units and employees, and for rational labor mobility. In the 
meantime, reform of the wage system should be stepped up, 
remuneration for work should be monetized, and wages should be 
determined mainly by productivity and by supply and demand for 
labor in the labor market. The minimum wage will be stipulated 
by law, and wages will be subject to state adjustment through 
taxation. Again, the residence registration system should be 
reformed. All these measures are essential for the cultivation 
of a labor market. 
  2. Set up labor markets with different levels and forms 
including national-, regional-, urban-, and township-level labor 
markets. Ordinary employment service centers, a market for 
advanced scientific and technological personnel, and an export 
labor market also should be set up. 
  3. Cultivate employment service centers. Vigorous efforts 
should be made to develop intermediary organs and service 
entities in the service of the mobility and allocation of labor. 
It is also necessary to set up more employment service systems 
providing employment services, vocational training, arbitration 
services, and so on, as well as a national unified information 
network providing information about supply of and demand for 
labor. 
  4. Accelerate housing reform, and establish and improve the 
social security system. This provides an important guarantee 
for the normal development and operation of the labor market. 
And, 
  5. Set up and improve various labor regulations so the labor 
market gradually will be standardized and modernized, and so the 
legitimate rights and interests of employees and employers will 
be protected. 
  [Reporter] Will you give me a brief account of the 
development of the property market? To what fields should we 
mainly direct our efforts in developing the property market in 
the future? 
  [Ma] The key tasks of land reform in urban areas are to 
cultivate and develop the land market and to change the system 
under which land is provided by the administration without 
compensation, without time limits, and without permission for 
circulation [wu liu dong 2477 3177 0520], into a system under 
which land will be provided with compensation, with time limits, 
and with permission for circulation -- in other words, a system 
under which the allocation of land will be decided by the market. 
  The relevant reform began in the 1980's. At the beginning, 
we made "a charge" for land use (such as levying a land use tax) 
and then allowed land to "circulate," resulting in the formation 
of a land market and in the greater role for the market in land 
allocation. In the process, however, a number of problems arose 
which must not be ignored. 1) The total supply of land is 
getting out of control. The situation in which land is granted 
by the authorities at various levels or by the authorities 
overstepping their power is grave. 2) Laws are being ignored in 
the transfer of land-use rights, meaning that transactions for 
land are concluded mainly by administrative means, or illegally 
or spontaneously. 3) The market mechanism for the formation of 
land prices is irrational. Land prices are usually fixed at 
random; some localities vie with one another to lower land 
prices, and some localities even offer land free, thus giving 
illegal businessmen engaged in real estate speculation an 
opportunity that can be exploited to their advantage. 
  In the urban land market system, the primary urban land 
market should be monopolized by the state, and the secondary 
land market should be free, though state control will continue 
to be necessary. The primary land market, meaning the market 
where land-use rights are transferred, must be managed by the 
state alone, but the method of transferring land should be 
reformed. It is necessary to introduce the market mechanism and 
put land-use rights on the market so as to expand the area where 
the market can play a role in the allocation of land, under the 
principle of separating the ownership of land, which must be 
retained by the state, and the right to use land. We should 
implement a system for the compensated transfer of land-use 
rights, with time limits and for particular purposes. With 
regard to the sale of land-use rights for commercial purposes 
other than for public use, we should change the negotiated-lease 
method into one of public auction and bidding. In the secondary 
land market, meaning the market for the transfer of land-use 
rights, the land transferred by the state should be allowed to 
be retransferred, leased out, and mortgaged at a price 
determined by the competitive market. The state, however, will 
still need to strengthen control over the secondary land market, 
for instance, the state must see to it that the land user plans 
the use of the land transferred, registers with the relevant 
authorities for the land transfer, reports the price at which 
the land was transferred, pays the value-added land tax, and so 
on, in order to forestall any attempt to illegally "speculate on 
land" to reap excessive profits in real estate transactions and 
to prevent the loss of state profits. 
  In the countryside, it is necessary to ensure that the 
amount 
of cultivated land will not be reduced, preventing land for 
agricultural use being turned to nonagricultural purposes.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Jiang Shijie (3068 0013 2638): "What Do </F>
Most Enterprises Do When Some Enterprises Are Operated As 
Experimental Units? -- On Building a Modern Enterprise System"] 
  [Text] The Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central CPC 
Committee said: The establishment of a modern enterprise system 
represents the orientation of reform of state-owned enterprises. 
  The State Commission for Restructuring the Economy and the 
State Economic and Trade Commission immediately decided to 
select around 100 state-owned enterprises and designate them as 
experimental units for establishing a modern enterprise system. 
  In the following two months or so, two kinds of situations 
arose in some enterprises: 
  First, a small number of enterprises volunteered for the 
work, wanted to become targets of experiment, and tried every 
means to stand in the forefront of deep-going enterprise reform. 
Second, a considerable number of enterprises held that, since 
the establishment of a modern enterprise system was a huge and 
difficult project which dealt with a wide range of issues, they 
could not hastily "break a new path" without enough meditation 
and certainly of success. Therefore, they took no action in 
enterprise reform and wholeheartedly waited for popularization 
of experimental units' experience. 
  Such a situation posed a question: What do most enterprises 
do when only a very small number of enterprises are operated as 
experimental units in the process of establishing a modern 
enterprise system? 
<H3>  The Decision Pointed Out Clearly: Do Not Stand By 
Unconcerned </H3>
  The proposal of establishing a modern enterprise system 
marks 
a new stage of enterprise reform in our country and embodies 
improvement of the overall standard of enterprise reform. The 
establishment of a modern enterprise system is a social and 
economic systematic project which is very rich in content and 
interrelated. It is very difficult to achieve the desired 
results and accomplish the set goal if we, as in the past, make 
a breakthrough in a single area. The Decision of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th Central CPC Committee explicitly 
pointed out: "To establish a modern enterprise system is an 
arduous and complicated undertaking. It requires the 
accumulation of experience and creation of the necessary 
conditions and should be conducted step by step. It is now 
necessary to continue to implement the Law Concerning Industrial 
Enterprises Owned by the Whole People and Regulations on 
Changing the Management Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises 
Owned by the Whole People, and to unreservedly extend to the 
enterprises the various rights and responsibilities pertaining 
to their own management. It is necessary to strengthen 
supervision and control over the state-owned assets possessed by 
enterprises and reach the aim of maintaining and increasing the 
value of state-owned assets. It is necessary to quicken the pace 
of change of the management mechanism and readjustment of the 
organizational structure of state-owned enterprises. 
Unwarranted pooling of funds, arbitrary requisitions of 
donations, and exaction of fees from enterprises must be 
resolutely stopped. It is necessary to reduce the financial 
burden the enterprises have to bear in supporting social 
undertakings. It is necessary to, step by step, make an 
inventory of and check the stockpiles and capital of 
enterprises, define the property rights, clarify debts 
receivable and debts payable, evaluate the assets to verify the 
amount possessed by the enterprise legal entities. It is 
necessary to create conditions in all respects for state-owned 
enterprises to shift steadily to the modern enterprise system." 
  The content of this part of the decision explicitly told us: 
At a time when a small number of enterprises are operated as 
experimental units, most enterprises have no reason to stand by 
unconcerned, but should rather, as always, accomplish the work 
of enterprise reform in various respects. Of course, some 
demands of the Decision are set on government departments at all 
levels. For example, to make enterprises be truly responsible 
for their own management decisions, prevent the "three 
unreasonables," and lighten social burdens shouldered by 
state-owned enterprises, and all these should be mainly handled 
by them. However, the course of deepening enterprise reform 
should be, of course, mainly completed by enterprises 
themselves. Any kind of pause and break cannot shorten the 
course of reform, but rather expends precious time to no avail. 
  As a matter of fact, as far as this reporter understands, 
many leading organs of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous 
regions and some industrial departments of the state have a very 
clear response to the question of "what do most enterprises do 
when a small number of enterprises are operated as experimental 
units." For example, at the meeting of leading cadres of 
national railways held in mid-January, Minister of Railways Han 
Zhubin said when talking about the issue of establishing a 
modern enterprise system: At present, we must mainly pay 
attention to three things -- bringing into effect the 
Regulations and the Implementation Method for Changing the 
Management Mechanism of Railway Enterprises; laying a good 
foundation and mainly paying close attention to the work of 
making an inventory of and check of the stockpiles and capital, 
defining the property rights, clarifying debts receivable and 
debts payable, and evaluating the assets; and setting up some 
units to experiment with the corporate system, gaining 
experience, avoiding formalism, and never rushing headlong to 
mass action. In another example, at the national metallurgical 
work meeting held in early January, Minister of Metallurgical 
Industry Liu Qi pointed out when planning the work of deepening 
enterprise reform: "At present, we must vigorously make all 
kinds of preparations and create conditions for implementing a 
modern enterprise system." He said that it was necessary to 
continue to implement the Regulations, to make an inventory of 
and check of the stockpiles and capital of enterprises, and 
select a dozen large iron and steel enterprises to make 
experiments in supervising their state-owned assets. After 
that, he particularly stressed that we must learn from the 
experience of such enterprises as Baoshan Iron and Steel Works 
and Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, fully implement the reform of 
internal enterprise structure, sever links with units and 
personnel not related to iron and steel production, establish a 
modernized enterprise management system, and deepen the reform 
of the personnel, labor, and wage systems in enterprises.... 
  The wishes to try as soon as possible to work according to 
the experience of experimental units are understandable, but it 
is incorrect if we fail to implement enterprise reform even when 
we can do so. 
<H3>  Inspiration From the Experience of Wuhan Iron and Steel 
Works: Stepping on the Gangplank Before We Board a Ship </H3>
  As far as the establishment of a modern enterprise system is 
concerned, some cadres commended it but also commented: "Why 
did we do it if we had known it beforehand?" The implication 
was that: Every effort in enterprise reform in the last 15 years 
was a sheer waste, just like lighting a candle for a blind 
person! 
  Such an understanding is incorrect because the practice of 
enterprise reform is a continuous process by stages. Over the 
past 15 years, enterprise reform underwent different stages, 
including the stage of delegating power to lower levels and 
letting them retain a portion of profits, substituting two-step 
taxation for the delivery of profits to the state, implementing 
the contracted management responsibility system, and changing 
the enterprise management system. Every step of reform not only 
offered experience but also laid the foundation for the next 
step of reform, and every new reform measure was proposed in 
light of the focal points and difficulties in the previous stage 
of reform. We can say that the basis for establishing a modern 
enterprise system does not exist without the success of reform 
in the last decade or so, and that we would not introduce the 
concept of establishing a modern enterprise system without the 
exploration of reform practice in the past. 
  In addition, some comrades said: Since the Central Party 
Committee has set the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system as the reform orientation of state-own enterprises, why 
cannot we wait patiently for some time and achieve our goal in 
one move by simply following the experience of experimental 
units to be introduced? 
  Is such an idea correct? Let us look at the reform practice 
of Wuhan Iron and Steel Works first. 
  On 7 January 1994, Liu Benren, president of Wuhan Iron and 
Steel Works, addressed the national metallurgical work meeting 
and briefed attendants on their decision to spend two years to 
reform the enterprise management system: Originally, there were 
more than 120,000 staff and workers in Wuhan Iron and Steel 
Works but the annual output of iron and steel was only around 5 
million metric tons and the per capita output was merely 40 
metric tons, which was far lower than the advanced international 
standard. The main reason was to plunge all its strength into 
work irrespective of the size of production, thus leading to 
great waste of labor force, equipment, and technological 
resources. From August 1992 onwards, Wuhan Iron and Steel Works 
drew on the experience of Baoshan Iron and Steel Works and 
started reforming the management system with emphasis on 
strengthening the main body and severing links with departments 
not related to iron and steel production. Up to the end of last 
year, more than 70,000 staff and workers left the iron and steel 
profession and successively formed "four large corporations" and 
"four small companies" to march to the domestic and 
international markets. Last year, the output of Wuhan Iron and 
Steel Works was 5.05 million metric tons, registering an 
increase of 6.12 percent over that of the previous year. 
However, the per capita output of iron and steel increased from 
40 to 93.4 metric tons, sales earnings and profits and taxes 
realized increased 30.67 percent and 34.45 percent compared with 
that of the previous year, and export exchange earnings exceeded 
$110 million, thus putting an end to the situation of stagnation 
for years. Afterwards, this reporter asked President Liu Benren 
about the relationship between reform of the enterprise 
management system and the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system. He presented a brilliant viewpoint after a little 
thought: 
  "Clearly defined property rights, as well as the rights and 
responsibilities of enterprises, separation of government 
administration and enterprise management, and scientific 
management are characteristics of a modern enterprise system. 
If we say that the first three characteristics can only be 
realized by relying on the coordination of government 
departments, `scientific management' must be achieved in a 
practical manner by relying on enterprises themselves. In 
particular, under the situation which Hubei Province and the 
Ministry of Metallurgy consent to the joint-stock transformation 
of Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, we have decided to take the 
initiative to reform the enterprise management system, and the 
goal is precisely to come close to a modern enterprise system as 
soon as possible." 
  Being positive and taking the initiative without relying on 
others and without delay, proceeding from the real conditions of 
one's own enterprise to select the breakthrough point for 
deepening reform, and trying by every possible means to come 
close to a modern enterprise system as soon as possible -- these 
are precisely what are inspired by the experience of the Wuhan 
Iron and Steel Works. If expressed in a more symbolic 
description, we must "step on the gangplank before we board a 
ship." Here, the "ship" refers to the modern enterprise system 
and the "gangplank" refers to the five aspects clearly pointed 
out by the Decision which we should accomplish. 
  It is a gradual process to establish a modern enterprise 
system in China, during which we have to shoulder heavy 
responsibilities and can never achieve our goal in one step. We 
must, in the first place, work in a down-to-earth manner, be 
persistent and dauntless, and march forward courageously. The 
more down-to-earth and comprehensive we do our work at early 
stages, the less time we spend in going through such a 
historical course.

  [Text] Beijing, February 8 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Ministry 
of Labor and the Ministry of Personnel issued a joint circular 
on the implementation of the State Council's regulations on the 
new working hours limits. 
  The circular said that workers in Chinese Government and 
state bodies, institutions, enterprises and other organizations 
will work eight hours a day and 44 hours a week from March 1. 
  It stressed that no organisation or individuals should 
extend 
working hours without authorization. 
  If the working hours of employees have to be extended, the 
employees should later be given free time in lieu, it added. 
  It said that state bodies and institutions will adopt 
unified 
working hours and rest days, that is, following a two-week 
cycle, with Saturday and Sunday as the rest days in the first 
week starting from March 1 and Sunday as the rest day in the 
second week. 
  It said that all enterprises should follow the new 44-hour 
week system. 
  It said that enterprises and units which have special 
difficulties in adopting the system can be given two months' 
grace, with the deadline set at May 1, 1994. 
  Officials from the two ministries pointed out that the 
regulations aimed at allowing employees more time for studying, 
educating children and attending household chore. 
  They said that the regulations should be implemented by all 
state organs, institutions, enterprises and other organizations 
in China, including state enterprises, collective enterprises, 
private enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises, and all 
trades such as mines, factories, building industry, 
communications and transportation, timber industry, state farms, 
commercial and service industries. 
  They stressed that no units should increase their labor 
force 
or expenditure, or reduce the income of employees on the pretext 
of shorter working hours.

<F P=106> [By Yang Yongzhe [2799 7167 0772]: "One Must Link Theory </F>
With Practice When Studying Deng's Selected Works and Increase 
Peasants' Income Through Reform and Development"] 
  [Text] The most important point of studying Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, I believe, is to 
link theory with practice and solve actual existing problems on 
the basis of understanding the essential spirit. 
  In terms of the rural areas, an important issue is how to 
continuously increase peasants' income through reform and 
development. Comrade Xiaoping says the criterion for evaluating 
our work is mainly to see whether it helps develop the socialist 
productive forces; whether it helps strengthen the comprehensive 
national power of the socialist state; and whether it helps 
raise people's living standards. If we use this criterion to 
measure our rural economic work, then I believe that while the 
rural economy has achieved substantial development in recent 
years, peasants' income has, however, not been raised 
correspondingly, and their incomes are not in keeping with 
economic development. Seen from the last five years of 1989 to 
1993, the net annual income of peasants, allowing for price 
rises, only increased by an average of 2.2 percent yearly. This 
is far less than the 5.5 percent speed required by the target of 
becoming well-off. Without peasants' income increasing, 
people's living standards cannot rise, and they will not have 
the enthusiasm necessary for building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Thus we cannot even begin to talk about the 
development of productive forces and the strengthening of 
comprehensive national power. Man is the decisive factor in our 
great socialist cause. As far as the rural areas are concerned, 
the decisive factor is the enthusiasm of the 800 million 
peasants. If we have this enthusiasm, then there is hope for 
our rural economic development and modernization of agriculture. 
However, if peasants' income increases slowly and rural 
purchasing power remains low, then the market for industrial 
products will not be able to open up and expand in the 
countryside. The potential of the large Chinese market is in the 
countryside, among the 800 million peasants. Therefore, an 
increase in peasants' income and a rise in their purchasing 
power is an major issue determining the development of China's 
market for industrial goods and the entire national economic 
development. The party Central Committee and the State Council 
are very concerned about this and, at the central agricultural 
work meeting held not long ago, listed increasing peasants' 
income as one of the major goals of rural economic development. 
  How to increase peasants' income? According to the 
experience of the last 15 years of reform and opening up, apart 
from increasing the party's and state's agricultural input and 
improving the policy environment so as to adapt better to the 
conditions of rural development, I believe three major changes 
are needed in terms of agriculture and rural economy itself in 
order to develop that economy and increase peasants' income. 
  The first major change is to rely on science and technology 
to raise per-unit grain per mu output, constantly increase total 
output, boldly adjust the industrial structure, and vigorously 
increase the production of meat, eggs, milk, fruit, vegetables, 
and other cash crops on the premise of satisfying the needs of 
the country and the people. This is not only needed for 
increasing peasants' income, but also required by the Chinese 
people if their living standards are to be raised as they work 
toward a well-off life. This change has already obtained 
successful experience in many places. For instance, Jiangxi 
Province has stabilized its total grain output above 50 billion 
jin by raising per-unit yields, and thus freed up several 
million mu of fields for fruit, vegetables, meat, eggs, and 
milk, achieving great success and increasing peasants' income 
substantially. In other places it is the same. This is a 
successful experience for the Chinese rural areas overall. 
Compared with 1978, the per-mu grain yield for 1992 over the 
whole country rose 197 jin. Because of this, while 200 million 
mu was taken out of grain cultivation, total grain output rose 
by 275.8 billion jin, which created the possibility of 
increasing the cultivation of cash crops and restoring forests. 
In accordance with the feature of China's resources structure 
of having a large population with little land, while developing 
land-saving farming, one must utilize sideline products, such as 
the stalks of crops, to develop grain-saving animal husbandry. 
One must also guide farming itself to reform from a two-tiered 
structure to a three-tiered structure. In the past, farming 
meant grain crops; later we added cash crops; now we again add 
crops for animal feed. The growing of crops for animal feed will 
become independent of farming and will produce animal feed 
directly to develop animal husbandry. This will be much more 
efficient than what we do now, which is to wait for corn to 
ripen and then make it into animal feed. I recently visited 
Germany. The Germans mash up large quantities of corn in the 
field, while it is still green, to feed cattle and milch cows. 
Some places in China now are doing the same. We can give full 
play to our advantage of having rich farm labor resources and 
exploit and use our land comprehensively to develop many kinds 
of food and nutrition resources for people's consumption. That 
is to say, apart from farming the 1.5 billion mu of cultivated 
fields, we must also develop nonfarmland resources such as 
uncultivated land, unused water, barren hills, beaches, and 
courtyards to increase the effective supply of food. 
  The second major change is to vigorously develop the 
processing industry, with agricultural products and by-products 
as raw material, and the transportation industry on the basis of 
discarding the traditional unitary farming and breeding 
industry, so as to develop a close linkage and mutual promotion 
of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. Successful 
experience has already been gained in this in many parts of 
China. We should summarize, spread, persist in, and develop 
this experience. The agriculture of most of China basically 
remains at the level of producing raw materials. On this 
foundation, we should develop processing and circulation as two 
necessary links of agricultural production, then the economic 
efficiency of agriculture will be substantially raised, and a 
broad employment outlet for rural labor will be opened up. In 
terms of production management, we should organize industrial 
chains according to the sequence: Trade, industry, and 
agriculture. To put trade first means putting marketing first, 
that is, to put the market in first place. Processing should be 
conducted according to market needs, and raw material production 
conducted according to processing needs. With an increase of 
farm products and processed goods and the expansion of 
transactions, the old state and cooperative commerce can no 
longer meet the need. Thus we must actively cultivate new means 
of transportation and marketing and encourage large numbers of 
peasants to leave farming and breeding, get organized, and enter 
the fields of circulation and services, to develop tertiary 
industries in the countryside. 
  The third major change is to guide the farm products 
processing industry and other nonfarming industries into a 
relatively concentrated and regional development, so that the 
development of township and town enterprises is linked with the 
construction of small rural towns. Based on the rational 
distribution of existing small towns, one should turn the large 
number of rural laborers into nonfarming industries, at the same 
time gradually concentrate them in small towns in a planned and 
organized fashion, and create possibilities for them to sever 
their ties with the farmland. This is not only the demand of 
industrial development itself, but is also needed for 
large-scale operation in agriculture. The relative 
concentration of industry will generate huge demand and drive 
the development of tertiary industry, and hence lead to the 
development of tertiary industry. The relative concentration of 
secondary industry and tertiary industry will result in the 
gradual development of rural small towns. Thus, nonfarming 
industry's development in the countryside will not only achieve 
economic results but yield social development at the same time. 
The new leap forward in China's agriculture depends on the 
development of nonfarming industry in rural areas and its 
combination with small towns. For agriculture to have high 
productivity and increase peasants' income substantially, one 
cannot rely only on raising prices. That is only one aspect. 
The main way out is to transfer rural labor away from the 
fields toward small towns and to operate agriculture on a large 
scale. This change is a long and gradual process. It cannot be 
done by rushing headlong into mass action, or by creating a 
"small town fever." The correct method is to actively guide the 
peasants to progress steadily. 
  According to current practice, the first change has already 
obtained general success, and the experience should be 
summarized, persisted in, and further developed. The second 
change has obtained some effect in some areas and accumulated 
certain experience that needs to be disseminated. The third 
change has already appeared in the coastal regions and suburbs 
of large cities; it requires investigation and study and summing 
up of experience so that guiding principles and policies that 
have the nature of a law can be promoted to guide the 
realization of this change in places having the necessary 
conditions. I believe that the realization of these three major 
changes is the road one must take to develop rural economy and 
increase peasants' income.

<F P=106> [By Wu Jiahuang (0702 1367 3552), director of the Customs </F>
Duty Department of the General Administration of Customs: "The 
Development of China's Socialist Market Economy and Reform of 
the Customs Duty System"] 
  [Text] In the 15 years since reform and opening-up, 
China's socialist market economy has made certain progress. The 
prices of agricultural and industrial products and service 
prices are basically determined by cost and the supply and 
demand relations, and prices set by the state have moved to a 
secondary position. The stress of economic reform is being 
shifted to funds, labor, technology, and other factor markets. 
In the course of development of the market economy, contacts 
between China and the outside world are getting ever closer, and 
China's foreign trade has already exceeded one-third of its GNP. 
China's economy has become an important component part of the 
world's economy. In such kind of economic ties, the customs 
duty system is playing an important regulatory role. 
  The development of China's market economy and further 
economic ties between China and foreign countries require that 
reform of the customs duty system should be intensified in three 
respects: First, reduce the customs duty rate; second, readjust 
the tax allowance policy; third, improve the customs assessment 
system. 
  1. To lower the level of customs duty. In the early days 
after the founding of the PRC, China carried out the policy of 
trade protection. The average customs duty rate of the first 
tariff worked out on that basis reached 53 percent. After 
reform and opening-up, China gradually reduced the tax rate, 
introduced the Brussels Tariff Catalogue in 1985, and changed in 
1992 to the Harmonized Tax System (H.S.) [preceding initials 
published in English] Catalogue in common use in various 
countries, and the average tax rate was reduced to 42.5 percent. 
Not all high customs duties are sure to be beneficial to the 
development of the national economy. In a certain sense, 
inappropriate high protection protects backwardness. It makes 
the benefited departments satisfied with the existing state of 
affairs without seeking progress, and does harm to the interest 
of other departments. In spring 1992, the State Council decided 
to reduce in the coming few years the customs duty rates in 
China to that of the average level of developing countries. All 
import regulatory taxes were reduced that year. At the end of 
1992, China reduced the tariff of 3,371 tax items; at the end of 
1993, it again reduced the tariff of 2,898 tax items. The two 
tariff reductions have lowered China's tax rate by 15 percent. 
Recently, the State Council Tariff Committee reduced the customs 
duties of cars by a big margin and carried out provisional 
reduced duty rates for a number of industrial raw and process 
materials. As the building and development of China's market 
economy are processes of gradual advance, the price relations 
between the products of China and those of other countries 
remain to be brought closer, and customs duty reduction is 
therefore a complicated system engineering, of which certain 
policy issues should be handled carefully, such as the issue of 
promoting the development of economic relations and trade, the 
issue of protecting national industries, and the issue of 
carrying out industrial policies. 
  2. To readjust the tax allowance policy. As a law 
enforcement department, China's customs has been carrying out 
the preferential duty policies determined by the CPC Central 
Committee, State Council, and government departments concerned 
since reform and opening-up. For example, the preferential duty 
policies of "assembling parts supplied by clients," "processing 
of materials supplied by foreign businessmen," "processing 
according to buyer's samples," and "compensation trade" 
determined by the State Council in 1979. These policies have 
enormously promoted the development of the processing trade, 
which has so far occupied over 40 percent of the total amount of 
China's import and export trade. In the early 1980's, the State 
Council approved the tax allowance policy for imports by using 
loans provided by World Bank and foreign governments. 
Twenty-one billion dollars in preferential loans have been used 
so far, which accounts for 30 percent of the total amount of 
China's foreign debts. There are corresponding customs duty 
preferential policies in special economic zones and coastal open 
areas, and the foreign trade volume of five special economic 
zones and 14 open cities comes close to one-third of China's 
total volume of foreign trade. 
  In 1983 the CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
decided to strengthen the work of using foreign investments, and 
granted preferential customs duties to machines, equipment, and 
materials imported by foreign investors. In early 1990's the 
State Council approved preferential policies for frontier trade 
and barter trade. Preferential customs duties are the outcome of 
reform and opening-up, and have promoted to a certain extent the 
use of foreign investments, the import of technology, and 
foreign trade development. However, there are too many tax 
allowance policies after all, which have caused serious 
comparisons between regions, trades, and enterprises, and become 
obstacles to equal competition in the market economy. 
Therefore, with further development of the market economy, we 
should clear up the tax allowance policies. Whatever 
preferential policies are beneficial to reform and opening- up 
and conform with the rules and regulations of the market economy 
should undoubtedly be continued for implementation. In the 
process of clearing up, we should judge our existing policies by 
the general principle of international trade -- the principle of 
most-favored-nation treatment and that of national treatment. 
At the end of 1993, upon deciding to greatly reduce the customs 
duties of cars, the State Council abolished their preferential 
customs duties. This is a good beginning. 
  3. The Customs' assessment system draws close to GATT. 
China has adopted Brussels' assessment methods over a long 
period of time. In judging whether the declared prices of 
imported commodities are acceptable or not, we use a kind of 
abstract "regular price" concept, tending to repel the price 
difference of the same kind of products produced in different 
countries and regions. When she revised the provisions of 
import and export tariff in 1992, China basically gave up the 
Brussels assessment concept, and accepted in principle the 
"actual transaction price" concept of the GATT Tokyo Round 
Assessment Agreement. Ninety-nine percent of the several 
million declaration forms handled each year by the Customs 
offices in China accept the actual transaction prices declared. 
They put into effect the minimum prices for only a small number 
of declaration forms, or replace the declared prices by prices 
of the same or similar products, by structural prices, or by 
deducting prices. Due to various kinds of complicated reasons, 
including the facts that the legal system is weak in the course 
of building the system of the market economy, that the means of 
antidumping has not been built up, and that the customs tariff 
tend to be somewhat low, it is quite common that import and 
export enterprises at present declare prices low or hide the 
truth in declaration. To cope with such a situation, Customs 
cannot but adopt the method of setting the lowest duty-paid 
prices for a number of products. With further in-depth economic 
structural reform in China, especially with the pricing reform 
being further in position, with further reduction of customs 
duties, and with the building up of antidumping, antisubsidies, 
and other protection means, the Chinese Customs will gradually 
narrow the scope of commodities using the methods of the lowest 
duty-paid prices, till finally giving up such a method. 
  The reform of the customs duty system has already promoted 
and will further promote the development of China's socialist 
market economy.

"Mainland's `Company Law' Suits the Needs of Enterprises' 
Property Rights Reform"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 3 February (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- 
"The Company Law of the People's Republic of China," which has 
been publicized for a long time, will be put into effect on 1 
July this year. This shows that the authorities intend to turn 
into legal measures all the decisions concerning the property 
rights reform of state-owned enterprises, so as to enable 
state-owned enterprises to develop according to the rules of the 
market economy, and to incorporate themselves (relying mainly on 
the legal person property rights of the board of directors) 
together with collective enterprises, joint ventures, and solely 
owned enterprises. 
  It has been learned that this "Company Law" was first 
drafted 
as early as 1983. However, the draft gave rise to many 
controversies and thus was difficult to fulfill. It was only 
after the CPC adopted a resolution on the property rights reform 
of state-owned enterprises and on shifting the country's economy 
into the orbit of the market economy at the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee last year that this 
"Company Law," which had remained a draft for as long as 10 
years, finally could make a public appearance and be put into 
effect. 
  Although there is a total of more than 1.8 million 
state-owned enterprises on the mainland, they are all under one 
"boss," that is, the central government. All state-owned 
enterprises, large or small, are subject to the jurisdiction of 
different government departments or of different governments at 
the provincial and city levels. Despite previous efforts to 
delegate greater autonomy to the lower levels, make concessions 
of profit, and enliven enterprises, no fundamental improvements 
have been made to the essence of the mandatory planned economy. 
Only by dividing "large-scale state-owned enterprises" into 
thousands and thousands of economic units that rely mainly on 
independent legal person status and act according to the rules 
of the market economy can there be any possibility to set up a 
modern enterprise system. The "Company Law" is meant to suit 
the needs of such property rights reform. 
  Under the modern enterprise system, enterprises are clear 
about property rights relations and can adopt the system of 
registered capital, separate themselves from administrative 
organs, and be independent and responsible for their own profits 
and losses. By so doing, these enterprises can enjoy the 
property rights of a legal person, and can divide, transfer, and 
reorganize an enterprise's property rights. Explicit 
stipulations have been set out in the "Company Law" on many 
issues, including the establishment and organizational structure 
of limited-liability companies and joint-stock limited 
companies, corporate financial and accounting systems, merger or 
division of companies, and the acquisition of bankrupt companies. 
  According to the stipulations of the "Company Law," a 
registered company should have its own shareholders board, a 
Board of Directors, and a supervisory committee. All decisions 
on major issues should go through collective discussions. For 
example, a joint-stock enterprise needs its Board of Directors 
to act as a guarantee if it wants to obtain a loan by placing 
its total assets in mortgage. At times when controversies 
arise, the chairman of the Board of Directors has the power to 
rule on the matter and so avoid endless disputes. Candidates 
for senior managers will no longer be recommended by enterprise 
leaders and appointed by personnel departments; instead, open 
placement tests will be given and only the best will be 
recruited, thus ensuring that senior posts will not be offered 
or accepted privately, and that able personnel will not be left 
out in the cold. 
  The "Company Law" also stipulates that evaluations must be 
made on the investment in kind of a registered company, and that 
the ownership and operational rights of the company should be 
separate. In addition, penalties also have been set out on 
law-breakers which will help check the growth of speculative and 
renamed companies. As a matter of fact, a large number of 
privately run speculative companies have emerged in recent years 
which are engaged in falsifying registered capital, investment, 
and investment acceptance; in reselling at a profit; as well as 
speculation in real estates and stocks through illegal means. 
Property rights relations in many renamed companies, which 
originally belonged to state-owned enterprises, are unclear, and 
their ownership and operational rights are mixed up. As a 
result, such companies "use official power when carrying out 
commercial activities," and thus can monopolize certain trades 
and industries. Some companies collect funds and issue stocks 
and bonds in an arbitrary manner, and their organizational 
structure and management system are so confused that they need 
to undergo a thorough rectification. The stipulations set out 
in the "Company Law" regarding the amount paid in by registered 
companies and on the evaluation of the assets, debts, and risks 
of registered companies will play a significant role in 
preventing the emergence of all the above-mentioned malpractices. 
  According to expert analysis, unlike Russia's corporate 
legal 
system, which takes to the road of privatization, the corporate 
legal system being established on the mainland is aimed at 
turning state-owned enterprises into popularly run ones. This 
is because after enterprises are incorporated, more than 50 
percent of the shares will remain in the hands of the "Share 
Holding Committee for State-Owned Assets," and the government 
still will be the biggest shareholder. At present, Mainland 
China is exploring the "marketization of the socialist economy" 
along the road of incorporating state-owned enterprises, and has 
avoided the road taken by Russia, which is based on the narrow 
sense of privatization. Without doubt, the mainland's practice 
of the "Company Law" inevitably will lead to a series of changes 
in both the personnel and management systems, and probably will 
encounter the obstruction of those with vested interests. This 
is because people are used to enjoying authority, and they will 
be at a loss or will act defiantly once they foresee the loss of 
their authority. Therefore, contradictions are unavoidable.

<F P=106> ["Circular of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and </F>
Trade on Issues Concerning Experiments With the Joint-Stock 
System in Economic and Trade Enterprises -- promulgated by the 
Ministry of Trade and Economic Cooperation on 5 October 1993"] 
  [Text] With a view to encouraging foreign economic and 
trade enterprises to change their operational mechanisms, 
injecting greater vitality into enterprises, enhancing the 
economic and operational efficiencies of enterprises and 
state-owned assets, and providing economic and trade enterprises 
across the country with good guidance in their experiments with 
the joint-stock system, this ministry now issues this circular 
on the following relevant points: 
  1. Experiments with the joint-stock system in foreign 
economic and trade enterprises should be carried out under 
leadership, by choice, and in a planned way. When carrying out 
experiments with the joint-stock system, foreign economic and 
trade enterprises should act in strict accordance with 
provisions promulgated by the State Commission for Restructuring 
Economy and other organs, including "Provisions Governing 
Enterprises' Experiments With the Joint-Stock System," 
"Suggestions on the Standards for Joint-Stock Limited 
Companies," and "Suggestions on the Standards for 
Limited-Liability Companies." Departments in charge of foreign 
economic relations and trade at all levels should take pains to 
organize and guide their own enterprises to experiment with the 
joint-stock system and should refrain from rushing headlong into 
mass action. 
  2. In order to strengthen leadership over experiments with 
the joint-stock system in economic and trade enterprises, this 
ministry has decided to set up a "Leading Group for the 
Experiments With the Joint-Stock System in Economic and Trade 
Enterprises" (for the names of group members, please see the 
appendix). The primary tasks of the leading group are: 1) To 
study and draw up principles and policies concerning economic 
and trade enterprises' experiments with the joint-stock system; 
2) To examine, discuss, and comment on applications and 
feasibility studies submitted by enterprises directly under the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT) to be 
reorganized into joint-stock enterprises; 3) To provide guidance 
to local departments in charge of economic relations and trade, 
and help them do a good job in experimenting with the 
joint-stock system; 4) To study and draw up policies and 
management methods for planning, quotas, permits, personnel, and 
finance which suit the needs of economic and trade joint-stock 
enterprises; and strengthen professional management over 
economic and trade joint-stock enterprises; 5) To do a good job 
in the propaganda, guidance, and explanations concerning 
experiments with the joint-stock system in economic and trade 
enterprises; and 6) To sum up and exchange experience gained by 
economic and trade enterprises from experiments with the 
joint-stock system, and bring about healthy development in the 
economic and trade enterprises that experiment with the 
joint-stock system. 
  Offices will be set up under the leading group. 
  3. Issues concerning foreign economic and trade enterprises 
engaged in experiments with the joint-stock system -- such as 
their necessary conditions, establishment formalities, and the 
issuance of stock to the public -- should be dealt with 
according to relevant stipulations, including the "Provisions 
Governing Enterprises' Experiments With the Joint-Stock System," 
"Suggestions on the Standards of Joint-Stock Limited Companies," 
and "Suggestions on the Standards of Limited Liability 
Companies." 
  4. When they are reorganized into joint-stock enterprises, 
foreign trade and industrial-trade enterprises in all localities 
and under different departments, as well as production 
enterprises that have been granted autonomy in foreign-related 
economic and trade operations, should subject their operational 
scope to reexamination and reevaluation by the MOFERT, and go 
through the necessary reorganization formalities in accordance 
with relevant stipulations. When applying for autonomy in 
foreign-related economic and trade operations, newly organized 
joint-stock enterprises first should obtain the consent of the 
MOFERT before going through examination and approval formalities 
according to relevant stipulations. 
  Please submit any questions and opinions rising during the 
implementation of this circulations promptly to the "Office of 
the Leading Group for Experiments of the Joint-Stock System in 
Economic and Trade Enterprises" under the MOFERT. 
  [Signed] The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and 
Trade

<F P=106> [By reporters Fu Gang (0265 0474) and Chen Yun (7115 5366)] </F>
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 31 Jan (XINHUA) -- While covering news 
at the State Administration for Industry and Commerce's Economic 
Inspection Department, reporters noticed that department 
Director Niu Hongrui had just received a letter. When he opened 
it, he saw a congratulatory discount card. On the left lower 
side of the card were printed these words: When mailing, this 
card must be placed in a corresponding envelope. Holding up the 
card, Niu Hongrui said to the reporters: This is called 
"compelling other people to buy the designated product." It is 
an act of unfair competition. [passage omitted] 
  In the past month or so, some gratifying changes have taken 
place in the market order in our country. Niu Hongrui 
summarized these changes as follows: 1) The momentum of 
regional blockades has subsided somewhat. In the past, 
authorities from many cities used administrative means to 
restrict goods from other areas from entering their cities. 
This practice particularly occurs more often on the eve of 
festivals. This phenomenon has decreased now. For example, in 
accordance with the "Law Against Unfair Competition," the Inner 
Mongolian autonomous regional government has rescinded 
regulations restricting the sale of wool to places outside the 
autonomous region. 2) When administrative organs for industry 
and commerce were investigating unfair competition practices, 
fewer people would come forward to plead for mercy. 3) Once 
they were subject to investigation, the majority of people 
involved would consciously acknowledge their wrongdoing and 
accept punishment. 
  What about complaints of unfair competition and their 
handling by administrative organs for industry and commerce? Ma 
Yanling, deputy director of the Economic Inspection Department, 
said: In the past month or so, administrative organs for 
industry and commerce in various localities have received many 
complaints, some of which have been registered, investigated, 
and handled. For example, on the first day of implementation of 
the "Law Against Unfair Competition," the Lanling Industrial 
Trading Company of Hainan Province placed an advertisement about 
its 1 million yuan lottery in HAINAN JINGJI BAO [HAINAN ECONOMIC 
DAILY], designating 30,000 yuan for the special prize and 10,000 
yuan for the first prize. However, the "Law Against Unfair 
Competition" clearly stipulates that in promoting sales with 
lottery tickets, the highest prize for the lottery must not 
exceed 5,000 yuan. The Hainan Provincial Administration for 
Industry and Commerce immediately suspended, according to law, 
the company's sales with lottery tickets attached and fined it 
10,000 yuan. [passage omitted] 
  In conclusion, Liu Hongrui told reporters: In accordance 
with the requirements of a market economy, the State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce will set up a fair 
trade bureau, the main functions of which will be to supervise 
transactions by major elements of the market; to check monopoly 
and unfair competition; to investigate and handle, according to 
law or on the basis of being authorized, cases involving 
smuggling and selling of smuggled goods and other illegal 
economic activities; to protect the rights and interests of 
consumers according to law; to investigate and punish acts 
seriously harming the rights and interests of consumers; to 
supervise economic contracts according to law; and to guide the 
work of contract arbitration organizations. The Fair Trade 
Bureau is being organized.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Transport Facilities To Gain Facelift"] </F>
  [Text] Transportation facilities will get a major boost in 
1994 to match the nation's expected economic growth rate of 9 
percent. 
  To support this goal, greater efforts will be made to 
recruit 
foreign investment and technology, said officials from the 
Ministry of Communications. 
  China is poised this year to add 18,000 kilometres of new 
highways. 
  The figure includes 960 kilometres of expressways and other 
high-grade roads, which will be funded by the ministry and local 
governments. 
  These new road projects include the major cross-country 
trunklines bisecting the mainland from north to south and from 
east to west. 
  One of the two cross-country lines runs from Tongjiang in 
northernmost Heilongjiang Province to Sanya in southern-most 
Hainan Province. The other extends from Beijing to Zhuhai in 
Guangdong Province, running parallel to the Beijing-Guangzhou 
Railway. 
  The first of the two east-west lines runs from Lianyungang 
in 
coastal Jiangsu Province to Korgas in the Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region, alongside the new Euro-Asian Continental 
Railway. And the second line links Shanghai in East China with 
Chengdu in Sichuan Province, largely following the route of the 
Chang Jiang River. 
  The blueprint also calls for 59 new seaport berths with an 
increased cargo-handling capacity of nearly 31 million tons per 
year. Last year, 19 deep-water coastal berths were built, four 
more than originally planned. 
  In addition, 370 kilometres of inland waterway lanes will 
get 
facelifts and l9 new river berths will be built, with an 
increased handling capacity of 3.2 million tons. 
  The ministry seeks substantial foreign investment this year 
in developing transportation facilities--above and beyond 
existing loans. 
  Some State-owned firms, handling the building and operation 
of highways, bridges or berths, may issue stocks and bonds 
abroad to recruit foreign investment, a ministry official said. 
  Foreign investment for transportation facilities was at a 
record high last year, the official said, although actual 
figures were not cited. 
  Last October, the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa-led 
consortium signed a major joint venture contract with China to 
develop the Yantian Port of Shenzhen into a world-class harbour. 
  The project's first phase, including two 50,000-ton 
container 
berths and four general cargo berths, has already been placed in 
service. 
  The project's second phase will consist of three 50,000-ton 
container berths, scheduled to open in 1995. 
  Meanwhile, businesses from the United States, the Republic 
of 
Korea, Malaysia and other countries are negotiating with Chinese 
authorities to build and manage such road projects as the 
Jilin-Changchun and Fuzhou-Guangzhou expressways. 
  By the end of 1993, China's road and port construction has 
used up to $1.7 billion in loans from the World Bank, Asia 
Development Bank and the Japanese Government. 
  This year the ministry will continue to open the land and 
water transportation market to the outside world in "a moderate 
way," said the official. 
  By the end of last year, the ministry had endorsed 381 
Sino-joint ventures for the development of highway 
transportation, 86 for waterway shipping, and 66 for vehicle 
repair work.

<F P=106> ["MOFERT Notice on Carrying Out State Asset Ownership </F>
Registration" promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) on 5 October 1993] 
  [Text] The State Council General Office this March [1992] 
relayed the "notice regarding the request for instruction by the 
departments such as the National Administration of State 
Property, on launching nationwide work in state assets ownership 
registration in 1992," and made it clear that such work would be 
launched in 1992. In May and July this year [1992], the 
National Administration of State Property held and presided over 
work conferences on state assets ownership registration, as well 
as meetings making arrangements for registering assets ownership 
in units directly under the central authorities. It also 
printed and issued "Temporary Measures Governing State Assets 
Ownership Registration" and "Procedures for Implementing the 
Temporary Measures Governing State Assets Ownership 
Registration," making concrete arrangements for registering 
ownership over state assets. In order to do a good job in 
registering ownership over state assets in economic and trade 
enterprises, and to gradually form a system, the relevant 
matters are hereby relayed as follows: 
  I. Strengthen leadership; improve understanding. 
  Various units must strengthen leadership over the work in 
registering ownership of state assets, and seriously learn from 
the State Council's "Notice on Strengthening Management of State 
Assets" and "Temporary Measures Governing State Assets Ownership 
Registration," as well as the procedures for implementation. 
They must upgrade the understanding of the significance of 
state assets ownership registration to protecting the integrity 
of state assets and preventing state assets from draining, and 
they must adopt effective measures in order to score real 
results. 
  II. Registration domain. 
  1. The central economic and trade enterprises, enterprise 
groups, jointly run enterprises, joint-stock enterprises, 
collective enterprises run by state assets, and business units 
with business licenses issued to legal persons for operating 
enterprises, of various levels and directly under the Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT], must register 
ownership of assets. 
  2. Foreign-funded enterprises, units under construction 
(these units will register ownership of assets upon completion 
of construction and opening for business), and the business 
units which have obtained non-legal-person business licenses, do 
not have to register ownership of assets at this moment. 
  3. The enterprises which have already registered ownership 
of state assets for the 1992 fiscal year according to the State 
Council's relevant regulations and based on their final accounts 
of 1991, no longer have to register ownership of assets. 
  III. Registration of ownership of state assets in central 
economic and trade enterprises will be organized and implemented 
according to subordinate relations in financial terms. 
  1. Various corporations directly under MOFERT, China Foreign 
Trade Center (Group), and China (Fujian) Foreign Trade Center 
Group, must submit their ownership registration forms to MOFERT 
for examination and verification, and to the National 
Administration of State Property for examination and approval. 
  2. The subsidiaries of various corporations are to be 
examined and verified by the corporations themselves, and 
examined and approved by MOFERT centrally. 
  3. The branch offices of corporations, as well as other 
units practicing independent auditing, are to be examined and 
verified by the corporations themselves, and examined and 
approved by MOFERT centrally. 
  IV. Regarding the work in registering ownership of assets in 
enterprise groups. 
  1. The corporations which have already been established as 
enterprise groups must still submit their asset ownership 
registration forms to MOFERT for examination and verification, 
and to the National Administration of State Property for 
examination and approval. 
  2. The asset ownership registration form to be submitted by 
an enterprise group should include the assets of enterprises at 
close stratum [jinmi ceng 4868 1378 1461], that is, the form 
should be filled in according to the total amount of assets of 
the core enterprise and the enterprises at close stratum. 
  The enterprises at close stratum do not have to register 
asset ownership individually, but must have their credit 
standing verified (they must also fill in the forms registering 
ownership of state assets, but the forms only have the function 
of verifying credit standing), a thing to be done by the core 
enterprises. 
  3. Regarding the enterprises at the loose stratum [songsan 
ceng 2646 2414 1416], that is, the enterprises which have no 
links or relations with a core enterprise in terms of assets, 
but which have come into being due to business relations, 
registration of assets ownership will be performed according to 
their original subordinate relations. 
  V. For the enterprises registering assets ownership this 
year [1992], the assets ownership registration forms should be 
filled in according to their final accounts in 1991. 
  VI. The financial departments of various units are to be 
responsible for the work in registering asset ownership within 
the units. 
  VII. Registration of asset ownership divided into 
categories. 
  On a natural basis, asset ownership registration is to be 
divided into four categories: Opening, changing, canceling, and 
inspecting business on yearly basis. A brief explanation is 
given below. 
  1. Registration of opening of business: Newly opened 
enterprises, the enterprises which have broken off from the old 
ones and become independent legal persons, and the new 
enterprises which are formed by merging, must perform 
registration of opening of business. 
  2. Registration of changing of business: When some part of 
an enterprise breaks off, when another enterprise is annexed by 
the enterprise (merging), when subordinate relations in terms of 
finance change, when increase or decrease in assets exceeds 20 
percent including (20 percent) [as published], and when the 
enterprise's address, economic nature, and representative of it 
as a legal person changes, the enterprise must register the 
change. 
  3. Registration of canceling of business: An enterprise 
which is annexed, canceled, or goes bankrupt must go through 
registration of cancellation. 
  4. Yearly inspection: All enterprises which are regarded as 
independent legal persons must go through registration of yearly 
inspection. 
  VIII. The assets ownership registration here mainly refers 
to registration of yearly inspection. Registration of opening 
of business, canceling of business, and changing of business 
must be handled individually. 
  IX. After examination and verification, state assets 
management departments will issue to enterprises "certificates 
empowering enterprises to occupy and use state assets," relevant 
regulations will be announced later. 
  X. This year's work in registering assets ownership will end 
before the end of October. The asset ownership registration 
forms of various corporations must be submitted to MOFERT before 
30 September for examination and verification, and the asset 
ownership registration forms of the enterprises which are 
subordinate to various corporations must be submitted to MOFERT 
before 10 October for examination and approval. 
  XI. Various corporations (enterprise groups) are requested 
to seriously organize work in registering asset ownership within 
their own systems. They may, according to the spirit of this 
notice, formulate implementation procedures and supplementary 
regulations for asset ownership registration within their 
systems, and report to MOFERT for the record. 
  XII. After the conclusion of the asset ownership 
registration work, MOFERT will join hands with the National 
Administration of State Property in assessing and accepting the 
work in registering assets ownership in various units under 
MOFERT. The units and individuals who have a good performance 
will be commended, and the enterprises and units which do not 
work according to the regulations and which are irresponsible in 
work will be notified and criticized, while those which have 
serious problems will have their asset ownership registration 
work and industrial and commercial registrations suspended. 
  Regarding how local economic and trade enterprises should 
begin the work in registering ownership of state assets, the 
departments in charge of economic and trade affairs in the 
localities are requested to make decisions together with the 
state asset management departments in the localities, and the 
forms for registering state assets ownership may be filled out 
according to this notice. 
  Annex: Explanation for filling in state asset ownership 
form.

interview with Hu Angang (5170 7254 6921) and Kang Xiaoguang 
(1660 2556 0342) specialists of the Group for Analyzing the 
National Situation, under the Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences, by staff reporter Liu Lu (0491 7216); place, date not 
given: "High Customs Duties Are Not Beneficial to Opening Up; 
Foreign Trade Monopolies Must Be Canceled"] 
  [Text] Control of foreign trade by the means of import 
quotas and import permits has become one of the main sources of 
corruption in mainland China's foreign trade sector and 
companies. Therefore one of the policy suggestions presented by 
Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang to the CPC higher leadership in 
their national condition study report entitled "Root Out 
Corruption Through Systemic Reform" is "to lower the customs 
tariff rate and remove non-tariff trade barriers." 
  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: Although high customs 
tariffs can serve to protect national industries in their 
infancy, such a policy will be unfavorable to their efforts to 
go beyond their infancy. When these industries are monopolized 
by a few enterprises, these enterprises may give up their 
efforts to upgrade their technology, improve product quality, 
and increase their competitive power on the market because they 
are protected by high customs tariffs. In any case, they will 
continue to enjoy a profit rate much higher than that enjoyed by 
other industries. In this regard, mainland China's automobile 
industry is a very typical case. The net prices of automobiles, 
either completely manufactured automobiles or those assembled in 
China, are much higher than the market prices of products in the 
same categories in the United States and Japan. Therefore, one 
should lower the tariff rate for imported cars by a wide margin 
and lift the restrictions on car imports rather than devote much 
energy to fighting car smuggling. 
  Hu and Kang's analysis shows that mainland China's foreign 
trade structure, especially the import structure, still retains 
some very conspicuous characteristics of the planned economy, 
such as foreign trade monopolies, import license and control, 
and high customs tariffs. The general managers of some 
companies dealing in foreign trade put it bluntly: "If 
enterprises were vested with the power to run import-export 
trade, what would we rely on for survival?" It is obvious to 
all that artificially imposed customs tariff barriers, foreign 
trade monopolies, and high tariff rates are, in substance, the 
components of a government policy protecting a small number of 
government-run organizations, monopoly groups, and vested 
interest groups, as well as some manufacturers. This policy has 
been hindering the overall opening up of the Chinese economy and 
is unfavorable to the effort to promote competition at home and 
abroad. 
  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang have put forward the following 
proposals: 
  -- To lower the customs tariff rate and lift non-tariff 
import restrictions. To rescind the import license system for 
major commodities, lift administrative control of commodity 
imports, reduce tariff rates, and simplify the tariff system. 
To withdraw the authorization for localities to reduce import 
tariffs or to grant import tariff exemptions. The power to levy 
tariffs should go to the central government. 
  -- To rescind the foreign trade monopolies, authorize 
enterprises to handle import-export business directly, and treat 
state-owned enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises equally. 
Enterprises' qualification to run import-export business should 
be examined and approved by the departments concerned. Permits 
for the import of major commodities can be put on public auction. 
  -- To lift the ban on foreign-funded business establishments 
running commerce, trade, banking, insurance, communications and 
transport, postal and telecommunication services, real estate, 
and tourism, so as to increase the competitive power of the 
domestic tertiary industry sector. 
  -- To effect a gradual transition to the commodity price 
framework of the international market, and to link the 
international and domestic markets. 
  -- To implement a policy to protect China's agriculture and 
some industries in their infancy, while introducing a more 
liberal policy to mitigate the monopolies in the automobile 
industry, the petrochemical industry, and so on.

"Mainland Foreign-funded Enterprises Witness Increase in Labor 
Disputes and Accidents"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 4 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Labor 
disputes and various accidents resulting in deaths and 
casualties have continued to surface in foreign-funded 
enterprises recently, and the matter has roused the concern of 
the authorities. To safeguard the lives, security and 
legitimate rights and privileges of staffers and workers in all 
sorts of enterprises, the State Council recently adopted the 
draft "Law on Labor," to be submitted to the National People's 
Congress, and made explicit stipulations on establishing 
workers' union organizations in foreign-funded enterprises. At 
the same time, Guangdong Province, where there is the greatest 
number of foreign-funded enterprises, is preparing to enact 
specialized legislation to ensure the legitimate rights and 
interests of workers and staffers in foreign-funded enterprises. 
  In the 150,000 foreign-funded enterprises -- whether 
cooperative, joint venture, or solely foreign-owned -- the 
capital-labor relations in most have been comparatively normal 
and harmonious, but a small number of foreign-funded enterprises 
lack safety installations and workers' welfare provisions, while 
paying no attention to workers' safety; they arbitrarily prolong 
working hours, are in arrears with or make deductions from 
workers' wages, arbitrarily fire workers and staffers, and even 
violate workers' personal rights and interests, including body 
searches upon leaving the factory after a day's work. Workers 
and staffers in related enterprises expressed their resentment 
and protest through work slow-downs, strikes, visits to 
supervising departments, or letters of complaint to the 
authorities. 
  This being the case, labor disputes in foreign-funded 
enterprises in various places have increased markedly in recent 
years. According to incomplete statistics, there were 50 cases 
of labor disputes in Xiamen's foreign-funded enterprises in 
1991, and 460 such cases in 1993. There were some 250 work 
stoppages in Shenzhen's foreign-funded enterprises in 1992, and 
some 4,000 complaints lodged, involving scores of thousands of 
workers and staffers; there were an even greater number of such 
incidents last year. The Shanghai municipal labor arbitration 
organization handled soem 70 labor disputes at foreign-funded 
enterprises in 1991, twice the number of such cases in 1989 and 
1990 put together; in 1992 and 1993, the number of such cases 
exceeded 100 each year. 
  Owing to insufficient safety installations, accidents have 
been frequent in many foreign-funded enterprises, and some fires 
broke out. The fire at a Hong Kong-funded technical toy factory 
in Shenzhen resulted in a tragedy involving 84 deaths and some 
40 casualties. Statistics showed that of the 206 major fires 
that took place in China last year, foreign-funded enterprises 
accounted for one-tenth. 
  Workers and staffers involved in labor disputes at 
foreign-funded enterprises were mostly laborers from rural 
areas. When they first worked at these enterprises, they had 
very little knowledge about what labor rights and privileges 
they should enjoy, so when they entered the factory, they did 
not sign contracts with those representing capital; they had a 
very weak sense of and capability for self-protection, and often 
were placed in the position of the weak. These peasant laborers 
who worked at foreign-funded enterprises valued their work 
opportunities, and generally were able to "endure" irrational 
things. When the state of affairs evolved into work slow-downs 
or strikes, it only proved that the working environment, 
conditions and treatment at some foreign-funded enterprises were 
so poor that they had gone quite beyond the workers' capacity to 
endure. 
  Labor disputes took place primarily in some medium-sized and 
small enterprises funded by Hong Kong or Taiwan businessmen 
which required little investment, but reaped high profits. 
These businessmen cherished hopes of repaying of their 
principal in a short period and of making money. This being the 
case, the factories' internal environment was very poor, lacking 
proper ventilation, dust-proofing, antitoxic safeguards, 
fire-proofing and noise-proofing, while constantly sparking 
serious accidents. At the same time, the work day could be 
extremely long. In many factories, workers and staffers had to 
work 10-12 hours on an average day; sometimes they had to work 
nonstop for 16 hours to get some particular job done on 
schedule. The payment for work at some foreign-funded 
enterprises was on the low side, with wage levels that were not 
up to the original stipulation. Sometimes, the level could be 
even lower than the minimum wage standards of local enterprises. 
At other times, foreign businessmen would arbitrarily keep the 
payment of wages in arrears. Welfare provisions were poor, too. 
Dormitories were dirty and disorderly; workers did not enjoy 
medical insurance and were not allowed compensation for injuries 
resulting from accidents in the workplace. What was more 
unbearable was that the managerial methods of some 
foreign-funded enterprises could be rough. Aside from being 
penalized when staffers and workers violated rules and 
regulations, cases of workers being confined, beaten, or cursed 
at sometimes took place. 
  Mainland workers' unions believed that foreign-funded 
enterprises made contributions to national economic development, 
but the rank and file of workers and staffers in such 
enterprises rendered meritorious services that should not be 
nullified, either. Their legitimate rights and privileges 
should be protected. From the angle of the development of 
foreign-funded enterprises themselves, the harmony and stability 
of labor-capital relations is the basic factor in enterprises' 
advance toward a sound cycle and their striving for economic 
results. This being the case, foreign businessmen should not be 
eager for quick success and instant benefits, still more should 
they refrain from forgetting all moral principles at the sight 
of profits. From the angle of the rights and privileges of 
workers and staffers, the state must complete and perfect the 
law on labor as quickly as possible. The far-too-general 
existing decrees and regulations on labor lack feasibility in 
actual operation, nor are they capable of checking law-breaking 
behavior. This being the case, a complete and perfect "Law on 
Labor" is in great demand. On this basis, the labor insurance 
system will be established to protect rights and privileges in 
the workplace. 
  To the mainland authorities, the completion and perfection 
of 
labor decrees and regulations, and the appropriate handling of 
labor disputes according to the law have a bearing on the 
confidence of investors from beyond our borders. In the wake of 
presenting the "Law on Labor," it is necessary to augment 
monitoring and examination, and to establish specialized 
supervision organizations. At present, some provinces and cities 
fear lest whatever they do should affect foreign investment. 
Thus they have provided 101 kinds of preferential treatment to 
foreign businessmen, paying great attention to allowing 
preferential treatment, but saying very little about 
administration according to the law. They have closed their 
eyes to many factory workshops failing to meet the requirements 
of the rules and regulations on safety and fire precaution 
measures. Thus the hidden danger of accidents has been left 
unresolved. From a long-range point of view, only by combining 
in an organic way the import of foreign investment with the 
completion and perfection of administration through the legal 
system will it be possible genuinely to push forward the 
healthy, stable, and sustained development of foreign-funded 
enterprises.

farmers' initiative into full play, promote the development of 
rural economy and increase farmers' incomes. 
  He said that China is a large agricultural country and the 
rural population accounts for 80 percent of the total. The 
leaders at various levels in rural areas should have farmers 
firmly in mind and they should take care of their living 
conditions and rely on them, he said. 
  At present, efforts should be made to increase farmers' 
incomes and continue to reduce their burdens, he said. 
  He also talked about specific measures for supplying farmers

<F P=106> [Beijing TV carried live Premier Li Peng's speech at a </F>
get-together for Spring Festival group greetings in Beijing on 
10 February 1994] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Feb (XINHUA) Comrades, friends: 
  At this moment when we bid farewell to the old year and 
greet 
the new one and when the whole nation jointly celebrates the 
spring festival, I, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council, extend New Year's greetings to everyone 
present here; happy New Year to the people of all nationalities 
in the country, to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots, and 
to Overseas Chinese; and cordial greetings to international 
friends who care for and support China's modernization. 
  The year 1993 was one in which we implemented in an 
all-around way the 14th National Party Congress guidelines and 
triumphantly marched along the path of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. We have made important achievements in 
reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. A new 
situation has emerged in all fields of work. The national 
economy has maintained its momentum of rapid growth. Positive 
results have been made in macroeconomic regulation and control 
measures adopted in conjunction with efforts to solve some 
difficulties and contradictions in the economic development. 
Our agriculture has produced good a harvest, and all aspects of 
our economic work in the countryside have developed. The 
industry has grown rapidly. Enterprise efficiency has risen to 
some extent. The investment structure has improved. Our 
transportation, electric power, telecommunications, and other 
key construction sectors have scored remarkable results. The 
urban and rural markets are abundant with colorful goods, and 
business is brisk. The people's livelihood has continued to 
improve. In line with the demands of building a socialist 
market economic structure, we have continued to deepen reform. 
As a result, the relationship between economic sectors has 
become more rational, the pace of our opening up to the outside 
world has accelerated, our import and export trade has steadily 
increased, and foreign investment has risen by a big margin. 
The building of socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, 
and the legal system has strengthened. Science and technology 
have achieved major breakthroughs. Education has steadily 
developed. Culture, arts, press, publication, radio, 
television, sports, public health, and other undertakings have 
all expanded in the process of reform. In the turbulent, 
changing international environment, our great socialist 
motherland has seen economic growth, political stability, 
national unity, and social progress, and is standing towering 
like a giant in the East. 
  Comrades, friends: The year 1994 will be one in which the 
national economy will maintain its momentum of sound 
development. It will also be a year crucial to our efforts to 
push forward reform. We must take as our guide Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, implement in an 
all-round way the guidelines of the 14th CPC National congress 
and Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
accelerate the building of a socialist market economic 
structure, maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development 
of the national economic, safeguard political stability, and 
promote social progress in an all-round way. 
  We should unswervingly carry out economic construction as 
the central task. We should seek new ways for economic 
development. We should bring economic construction onto the 
track of relying on scientific and technological progress and 
the improved quality of workers. We should concentrate our 
efforts on structural readjustment and the improvement of 
efficiency. Food is the first necessity of the people. At no 
time must we relax our efforts in agriculture. We must develop 
the rural economy in an all-round manner and strive to do 
everything possible to reap a good agricultural harvest this 
year. We must ensure the steady and increased production of 
grain, cotton, and oil. We should try in every possible way to 
increase incomes for farmers so as to improve their living 
standards. 
  Conscientious efforts should be made to effectively run 
large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and to increase their 
vitality. Enterprises should be market-oriented, and they should 
readjust their product mix and produce marketable goods. They 
should step up their technical transformation and strengthen 
their operations and management to ensure the maintenance and 
increase of the value of state-owned assets. 
  We should strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation 
and 
control, rationally control the scale of capital construction, 
and strive to maintain a basic balance between total demand and 
total supply. At the same time, we should further deepen the 
structural reform in education, science and technology, and 
culture so as to promote the development and thriving of other 
undertakings. 
  The Third Plenary Session of the party's 14th Central 
Committee made the blueprint for establishing a socialist market 
economic structure, which is the program of action for us to 
further deepen reform. The main tasks of reform this year are: 
  1. To effectively organize the implementation of major 
measures for fiscal, taxation, financial, investment, and other 
reforms and establish and improve the system of macroeconomic 
regulation and control; 
  2. To continuously change the operating mechanisms of 
state-owned enterprises and seek effective ways for establishing 
a modern enterprise system meeting the requirements of the 
socialist market economy; and 
  3. To appropriately advance price reform after giving full 
consideration to the tolerance of the different sectors of 
society and develop and perfect the market system. 
  Our reform tasks this year are arduous. But we can certainly 
ensure the smooth development of various reforms provided we 
work together with one heart, carefully organize our efforts, 
coordinate with one another, and promptly handle contradictions 
discovered on the road of advance according to the principles 
and arrangements set by the party Central Committee and the 
State Council. 
  We should continue to open wider to the outside world, 
making 
use of more foreign capital, technology, and managerial 
expertise. We should further develop foreign trade and 
exchanges and cooperation [with other countries] in science and 
technology, education, culture, and other fields. 
  Now our country has such good conditions as opportunity, a 
favorable geographical position, and the support of the people 
[tian shi di li ren he]. Our national economy is growing 
steadily and rapidly [chi xu kuai su zeng zhang]. It is 
estimated that our market has a tremendous potential. It can be 
expected that there will be very good prospects for our economic 
and technological cooperation with various countries of the 
world. 
  Comrades and friends: Seizing the opportunity, deepening 
reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability are the major principle for our country's work this 
year [called the 20-character principle]. All fields of work 
must be subordinated to and serve these interests. We should 
promote reform of the economic structure during the rapid growth 
of the national economy; at the same time, we should also 
maintain the steady growth of the national economy during the 
transformation of the economic structure. Therefore, we must 
conscientiously and properly handle the relationship between 
reform, development, and stability. We should uphold the 
principle of grasping two links at the same time and putting 
stress on both links. While concentrating our efforts on 
economic reform and development, we should continue to do a good 
job in strengthening the building of the CPC, and vigorously 
strengthen the building of socialist spiritual civilization. We 
should develop socialist democracy, strengthen the legal system, 
deepen the anticorruption struggle, and effectively solve 
public-order problems in a comprehensive way to create a 
favorable environment for reform and development. 
  On festive occasions, more than ever we think of our dear 
ones far away. As we celebrate the Spring Festival with 
jubilation, we think more than ever of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and 
Macao compatriots and Overseas Chinese. Promoting reunification 
of the motherland in line with the concept of peaceful 
reunification and one country, two systems is the common 
aspiration of all Chinese people. 
  In the past year, there was sustained development in 
economic 
cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and 
personnel exchanges and other kinds of exchanges increased 
gradually. We reached initial understanding in our talks on 
routine matters. We are happy about that and hope the Taiwan 
side will put national interest above everything else and work 
together with us to develope cross-strait relations and to 
promote peaceful reunification of the motherland. 
  The dates are getting nearer for our country to resume its 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao. Cooperation between China 
and Portugal on the Macao issue is progressing smoothly at 
present. We are satisfied with that. 
  The British side is responsible for the termination of talks 
between the Chinese and British Governments. We hope the 
British Hong Kong Authority will not sink deeper and deeper into 
the wrong path. No matter what unexpected turn [bo zhe] things 
take, the Chinese Government and people have the determination 
and ability to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong according to 
schedule, and they are also fully confident of maintaining 
long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. 
  Comrades and friends, 
  In the past year, the Chinese Government has unswervingly 
pursued an independent foreign policy of peace. We have made 
new achievements in foreign affairs work. Our country continued 
to expand friendly ties with other countries in the world, its 
international standing continued to rise gradually, and it 
played important roles in international affairs. We made 
friends all over the world. 
  The Chinese Government and people, as always, will continue 
to join the governments and peoples of various countries in 
making unremitting efforts to strive for the establishment of a 
fair and reasonable new international political and economic 
order, to safeguard world peace, and to promote common 
development. 
  Comrades and friends, 
  We feel tremendously proud when we look back at the past, 
and 
we are full of confidence when we look to the future. We are 
faced with excellent opportunities for reform and opening up, 
and the prospects for socialist modernization are incomparably 
bright. Let us -- under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and 
under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Jiang 
Zemin as the core -- unswervingly implement the party's basic 
line, strengthen the great unity among all nationalities in the 
whole country, be of one heart and one mind, wage hard struggle, 
and strive for new victories in socialist modernization!

  [Text] Beijing, February 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng today extended greetings to compatriots in Taiwan, Hong 
Kong and Macao, and Overseas Chinese at a gathering to mark the 
Spring Festival, which falls on today. 
  Quoting an old Chinese saying that "on festive occasions 
more 
than ever one thinks of his dear ones far away", the premier 
said that while celebrating the Spring Festival, "we more than 
ever think of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao compatriots and the 
Overseas Chinese ." 
  On the question of Taiwan, he said that it is the common 
will 
of all the Chinese people to promote reunification of their 
motherland in accordance with the principle of "peaceful 
reunification, and one country, two systems". 
  In the past year, economic cooperation across the Taiwan 
Straits continued to develop and exchanges between people on the 
two sides were expanded, while initial understanding was reached 
in business negotiations, the premier said, adding that "we are 
happy with such progress". 
  He expressed the hope that the Taiwan authorities will value 
national interests above everything else and work together with 
the mainland to push forward the process of reunification. 
  Li Peng voiced satisfaction with the smooth cooperation 
between China and Portugal on the question of Macao, but noted 
that the responsibility for the suspension of the Sino-British 
negotiations lay on the British side. 
  He said that no matter what will occur, the Chinese 
Government and people are determined and capable to resume the 
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and to maintain long-term 
stability and prosperity there. 
  On foreign relations, Li said China, along with other 
countries, will make unremitting efforts toward the 
establishment of a new international political and economic 
order, the maintenance of world peace and the promotion of 
common development.

  [Text] Xiamen, February 10 (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, 
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, today attended 
a Spring Festival party in Xiamen city, in east China's Fujian 
Province. 
  After the meeting, Liu, also a member of the Standing 
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of 
the Chinese Communist Party, went to two ports at Xiamen to 
convey festival greetings to the on-shift workers. 
  On Wednesday, Liu visited an army unit to see officers and 
men. He talked with the soldiers and listened to them about

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
Counsellor Office and the Central Research Institute of Culture 
and History held a Spring Festival tea party today in Beijing. 
Qian Qichen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, attended today's 
tea party and extended cordial greetings to all State Council 
counselors and Central Research Institute of Culture staff on 
behalf of the State Council. 
  In his speech, Vice Premier Qian Qichen said in the 
soon-to-be-elapsed Chinese calendar year, the entire party and 
the people of all nationalities in the nation have, under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the party basic line, seized 
the opportunity, deepened reform, and made solid efforts in 
realizing the establishment of a socialist market economic 
system. In the past year, China achieved rapid economic growth; 
the market thrived; the standard of living level improved; 
society enjoyed stability; people of all nationalities showed 
solidarity; various social undertakings achieved new progress; 
the anticorruption struggle led by the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council, which won the hearts and minds of the people, 
scored initial results; diplomatic work showed marked results, 
creating a more advantageous international environment for our 
country's economic construction. We are also pleased to know 
that the multiparty cooperation and political consultative 
system, under CPC leadership, has been further consolidated and 
that the party's united front work has been constantly 
strengthened. Members of the Communist Party and various 
democratic parties and patriots without party affiliation 
showing utter devotion to one other, sharing weal and woe, and 
joining in discussing national affairs have become an important 
feature in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  The coming Chinese new year will be particularly crucial for 
building our country's socialist market economy as a number of 
major reform measures will be introduced that year. It is 
necessary to continuously give play to the political superiority 
of the united front work in the new period, to mobilize all 
positive factors, seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up 
wider, and accelerate the pace of building the socialist market 
economic system. 
  Qian Qichen said that in the past year, the state counselors 
conducted a massive number of investigations and 
enthusiastically advanced proposals on government work, to which 
leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee, the State 
Council, and relevant departments attached great importance. 
Central Research Institute of Culture and History staff members 
worked diligently and achieved marked results in various social 
and cultural undertakings. In addition, Central Research 
Institute of Culture and History counselors and staff members 
also established ties with various overseas circles, forged 
friendships with them, and contributed to economic and cultural 
exchanges between China and overseas areas and to the great 
cause of reunification. 
  At the tea party, State Council Counselors Office and 
Central 
Research Institute of Culture and History representatives 
reviewed their work in the past year and expressed their wishes 
to continue contributing to socialist modernization construction 
and to the building of spiritual and material civilizations with 
their knowledge and special skills. 
  Other leading comrades who attended today's tea party 
included: Cheng Siyuan, vice chairman of the National People's 
Congress Standing Committee; Luo Gan, state councillor and 
secretary general of the State Council; and Hu Sheng, vice 
chairman of the national committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference. 
  Wan Shaofen, deputy head of the CPC Central Committee United 
Front Work Department, presided over today's tea party. 
  Responsible people from the relevant CPC Central Committee 
and State Council departments as well as dozens of Central 
Research Institute of Culture and History counselors and staff 
members attended today's tea party.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Jizhong (0719 0679 0112)] </F>
  [Text] Shijiazhuang, 1 Feb (XINHUA) -- During a recent 
visit to rural primary and middle-school teachers in mountainous 
areas in Hebei, Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, said 
emphatically: Governments at all levels should further improve 
their understanding of elementary education in the countryside, 
take measures to strengthen and improve compulsory education in 
the countryside, earnestly resolve problems regarding teachers' 
salaries and housing, and constantly improve teachers' 
qualifications and teaching quality, in order to train large 
numbers of people with practical skills to assist in rural 
economic development, as well as to lay a sound foundation for 
achieving, on schedule, fairly comfortable living standards and 
for promoting a rural economic boom. 
  Accompanied by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the Hebei 
Provincial Party Committee; Governor Ye Liansong; Xu Zhijian, 
deputy secretary general of the State Council; and Liu Bin, vice 
minister of the State Education Commission, Li Lanqing braved 
the biting cold to visit Shijiazhuang City, Baoding City, and 
Baoding Prefecture on 30 and 31 January. He conducted 
investigations and studies on educational work in rural areas 
and visited with teachers in five primary and middle schools in 
mountainous areas in Pingshan and Shunping counties. Upon 
arriving in each school, Li Lanqing carefully inspected school 
buildings and teachers' dormitories, inquired about teachers' 
working and living conditions, asked about the payment of 
teachers' salaries, and found out about the school's teaching 
problems. On behalf of the State Council, he extended best 
wishes to the vast numbers of teachers who had worked quietly, 
devotedly, and conscientiously under difficult conditions in 
rural areas, especially in mountainous areas, all year round. 
He extended New Year's greetings to them, wished their families 
happiness, and encouraged them to make even greater 
contributions to rural education. 
  In recent years, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, the 
provincial government, and leaders at all levels took education 
seriously and promptly solved the problem of teachers' back pay. 
They are currently studying and devising safeguards aimed at 
realizing the goal of basically universalizing nine-year 
compulsory education and basically eradicating illiteracy among 
young and middle-aged people, as well as safeguards against 
delays in paying teachers' salaries. Li Lanqing fully affirmed 
these actions. Pingshan County in Shijiazhuang City is a 
revolutionary base area, which is generally not prosperous. The 
county party committee, however, made this decision: 
County-level leaders may not draw their salaries if they 
postpone paying the salary of even a single teacher in the 
county. Li Lanqing spoke highly of Pingshan County leaders' 
attitude of respecting teachers and stressing education, as well 
as their determination in this regard. 
  During the tour, Li Lanqing repeatedly emphasized: 
Elementary education is the basis of all kinds of education, 
and it affects the entire nation's quality. China's rural 
population numbers 800 million, and the crux and focus of 
elementary education lie in the countryside. If peasants do not 
possess an elementary education and professional skills, we 
cannot realize the goal of developing the rural economy and 
achieving fairly comfortable living standards in the entire 
country. Therefore, governments at all levels and educational 
administrative departments must make great efforts to earnestly 
improve elementary education in rural areas. We must tailor 
rural education to local conditions, fully consider practical 
needs and conditions in rural areas, and seriously study and 
reform the methods of running schools in those areas. He fully 
affirmed Shunping County's practice of introducing vocational 
education in certain stages of elementary education in rural 
areas, and of training large numbers of a new type of peasants 
who possess both an elementary education and a certain level of 
farming skills. He said: Making overall plans for agriculture, 
science, and education in rural areas is a good approach. This 
will not only help train more useful personnel for the 
countryside and accelerate rural economic development, but will 
also effectively universalize nine-year compulsory education in 
rural areas. 
  During the tour, Li Lanqing also held informal discussions 
with Hebei provincial leaders, responsible persons from relevant 
departments, and teachers' representatives on reform and 
development of higher education, vocational education, and adult 
education. He also heard the opinions and proposals of 
participants.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Wu Jing (0702 4552) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Central Committee 
for Comprehensive Management of Public Security [CCCMPS] held 
its 11th plenary session at the Great Hall of the People this 
morning. Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Secretariat and chairman of the CCCMPS, said: This year is 
extremely critical for accelerating the establishment of a 
socialist market economy. This year, maintaining political 
stability and social security become even more arduous, as does 
the comprehensive management of public security. Therefore, the 
responsibility on our shoulders is heavier than before. It is 
necessary to have a clear understanding of this situation. With 
a high sense of responsibility for the party and the people, 
each and every department should play its own role and work hard 
to ensure the accomplishment of the task. 
  Shu Huaide, member of the CCCMPS and secretary general of 
the 
Central Commission on Politics and Law [CCPL], conveyed the 
guiding spirit of the CPC Central Committee leading comrades. 
Chen Jiping, vice secretary general of the CCPL, member of the 
CCCMPS, and director of the CCCMPS general office, gave an 
explanation on the "Key Points of the 1994 Comprehensive 
Management of Public Security Work" and the "Opinions Concerning 
Further Strengthening the Work of Arranging Jobs for and Helping 
and Teaching Personnel Who Are Released After Serving Their 
Sentences or Being Released From Labor Education Institutions" 
jointly forwarded by the CCCMPS and five ministries and bureaus. 
He also gave a briefing on the plan for setting up positions 
for special inspectors. CCCMPS members who attended the meeting 
examined these two documents. Relevant departments exchanged 
ideas about their plans for carrying out their work this year. 
  Ren Jianxin affirmed the results achieved in the work of 
comprehensive management of public security over the past year 
in maintaining social stability and safeguarding the drive of 
reform, opening up, and modernization. He said: "Paying equal 
attention to material and spiritual civilization construction" 
is a basic principle for establishing socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always iterated the 
great importance of this principle, as has the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. It is a common 
task for the whole party to conscientiously carry out this 
principle and correctly handle the dialectical relations between 
the drive of reform, opening up, and economic development on one 
hand and political stability and social security on the other. 
The task is particularly important for major leading comrades 
of party and government organs at all levels. Therefore, the 
responsibility system for carrying out comprehensive management 
of public security should be strictly enforced. 
  Ren Jianxin pointed out: Facing new conditions and problems, 
party committees and governments at all levels as well as the 
CCCMPS should further improve their work style and leadership, 
go deep into the reality of life, immerse themselves among the 
masses, conduct more investigations and studies, and know how to 
find outstanding problems affecting political stability and 
social security as well as those security problems strongly 
criticized by the people. They should pay close attention to 
weak links in the comprehensive management of public security 
and take timely measures to conscientiously solve them. It is 
imperative to strengthen the analysis of the social security 
situation; study the development trend of public security 
problems under the new situation; and formulate effective 
measures for cracking down on crimes, prevention, education, 
management, and other aspects so as to control the initiative in 
the struggle. 
  He said: In carrying out the comprehensive management of 
public security, it is necessary to further liberate our way of 
thinking. The most fundamental thing is to follow the mass line 
in carrying out specialized work and fully mobilize the 
enthusiasm of the great masses of the people, all circles in 
society, and relevant departments. It is necessary to 
strengthen giving publicity to comprehensive management of 
public security and better mobilize and organize the people to 
participate in this work. 
  Ren Jianxin emphatically said: It is imperative to bring 
into full play each department's functions in maintaining social 
stability so as to show the effectiveness of joint efforts. 
Only when the force of all sectors has been condensed and their 
work is well coordinated can the special advantage of 
comprehensive management be really demonstrated. 
  Ren Jianxin said: The work should be focussed on grass-roots 
units where all measures are expected to be conscientiously 
carried out. Grass-roots units' basic work in comprehensive 
management of public security should be strengthened this year 
through a major project for improving public security in public 
and complex places in urban and rural areas. The building of 
party organs at village, township, and neighborhood level should 
be strengthened. Great results should be achieved in two or 
three years so that all measures of comprehensive management of 
public security will truly blossom and bear fruits in 
grass-roots units. 
  Also attending the meeting were CCCMPS Vice Chairmen Zhang 
Siqing and Cao Zhi.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Yaqun (0491 0068 5028): "Provincial Meeting </F>
on Public Security Work Stresses the Importance of Maintaining 
Social Stability and Safeguarding Economic Development"] 
  [Excerpts] The main topic of the provincial meeting on 
public security work which ended on 23 January was how to bring 
into full play the dictatorship function and role of public 
security organs in maintaining social stability and safeguarding 
economic development. Yang Yongliang, Wang Yang, Lu Shengdao, 
and Wang Sheyun spoke at the meeting. 
  Our province achieved marked results in public security work 
in 1993. The struggle of cracking down on crimes continues to 
develop. The number of criminal cases resolved increased by a 
great margin over the number in 1992. Public security and 
prevention work have obviously been strengthened. We have 
achieved step by step results in the anticorruption struggle. 
The overall quality of police and cadres has been enhanced. 
[passages omitted] 
  In his speech at the meeting, Deputy Secretary Yang 
Youngliang pointed out: Public Security organs at all levels 
should place the work of maintaining political stability and 
social security high on the agenda. It is necessary to 
unswervingly adhere to the principle of cracking down on 
criminal activities in accordance with the law and deal with 
them quickly and severely. More efforts should be made to 
strengthen the building of the public security contingent so as 
to meet the needs of the situation as it develops. He urged 
party committees and governments at all levels to 
conscientiously strengthen and improve their leadership over 
public security work and create good conditions for public 
security organs to enforce the law. In this way, public 
security organs will be able to better play their important role. 
  Wang Yang, provincial CPC committee standing member and vice 
governor, also spoke at the meeting.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Guide People With Correct Public </F>
Opinion"] 
  [Text] Correctly guiding public opinion is a most 
important task in the party's propaganda and ideological work. 
There are thousands of newspapers, tens of thousands of 
magazines and journals, and hundreds of television and radio 
stations in our country covering extensive areas, wielding great 
influence, in touch with the masses every day, and swaying 
people's minds and behavior. As "water can keep boats afloat as 
well as sink them," correct guidance of public opinion can 
cohere people's hearts, invigorate spirits, raise the fighting 
spirit, and promote unity; while wrong guidance of public 
opinion fwill confuse opinions, dissipate hearts and minds, sap 
the fighting spirit, and result in the serious consequence of 
political, economic, and social destabilization. Ours is a 
country of 1.1 billion population and a party of 50 million 
members in pursuit of a socialist market economic system to 
achieve the unprecedented objective of the "three-step" 
development strategy. The international situation which 
confronts us is complicated and volatile and the domestic 
situation contains radical differences. Given the 
circumstances, it becomes much more important to insist on 
correctly guiding public opinion; maintaining a stable, unified, 
active, and lively political situation; and creating a good 
social and opinion climate for the pursuit of reform and 
construction by people throughout the whole country and the 
party, under leadership and in an orderly fashion. 
  Both positive and negative experiences since the Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee show us that 
it is of vital importance to correctly exercise the functions of 
media opinion, so far as leading people's thought and behavior 
in the direction of pursuing socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is concerned. Leading cadres of party 
committees, propaganda departments, and press and publication 
units at all levels must tackle the job of guiding public 
opinion with a high sense of responsibility and must not take it 
lightly. 
  Correctly guiding public opinion is ultimately and 
fundamentally determined by successfully clinging firmly and 
unwaveringly to the party's basic line and unifying the thinking 
of the people of the whole party and country with it through 
vigorous propaganda and ideological mobilization. We must 
correctly grasp the situation amid the kaleidoscopic, 
complicated, and confusing social phenomena; strengthen the 
awareness of the whole situation; propagate practically and 
graphically the party's line, principles, and policies, so that 
people can understand, as quickly as possible, momentous party 
and government reformist and opening up measures and transform 
this understanding into voluntary actions; and, in this way, 
mobilize and encourage as much as possible people to devote 
themselves to the cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  This year will be most critical for deepening reforms and 
promoting development and will see the unveiling of many 
reformist measures for building a socialist market economic 
system. The breadth, depth, intensity, and degree of difficulty 
of reforms this year will be greater and harder than in any 
previous year. This means that press and propaganda work must 
be closely coordinated; investigations and studies of social 
climate and trends in people's views must be strengthened; 
personnel must keep themselves updated on the latest changes in 
concepts of value, thoughts, moods, and mentality, so that they 
can detect trends from small rumblings, deal with things in 
advance, dissolve contradictions, straighten out grievances, 
guide people with a clear-cut stand toward reforms and to 
support and participate in reforms in order to ensure victory 
for this year's initial battle of deepening reforms. They must 
uphold materialistic dialectics, prevent partiality and 
simplification, and properly handle relations between reforms 
and development, those between reforms, development, and 
stability; and those between the local and overall situations. 
They must look out for the possibility that one trend may lie 
hidden another, prevent rushing headlong into mass actions or 
uniform and indiscriminate administrative measures, and the 
situation where everyone jumps on the bandwagon. They must 
concentrate their energy on showing the rapid progress of the 
cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics; 
enthusiastically eulogize people's shining achievements and 
their noble character reflected in transforming the world and 
creating a new life; review the situation and judge the times 
well, and be good at providing guidance; take and present their 
clear-cut position on significant issues concerning principles 
and the entire situation, instead of being wishy washy about 
them; promptly defuse sensitive and hot issues instead of 
"hyping them up"; refrain from fruitless debate; determine the 
"amount" of coverage and propaganda on issues of immediate 
concern to the masses; explain and allay their doubts and 
anxieties incisively; and be the voice of the people. 
  One of the important channels through which the people 
exercise their democratic rights is the media reflection of 
people's views and demands and the monitoring of party and 
government organs and their workers. It helps make our 
decisions scientific and improves our work. Strengthening the 
media's watchdog role also represents the need to correctly 
guide public opinion. The key to properly exercising the 
media's watchdog role lies in critical reportage and the 
reflection of the masses' opinions. The media must deal 
seriously with their work, from selecting typical events, ways 
and methods adopted, to timing. They must do everything with an 
eye on promoting work, solving problems, enhancing unity, 
maintaining stability, and boosting people's confidence in 
pushing ahead. 
  In guiding public opinion, they must strictly observe 
propaganda disciplines. Party newspapers, party journals, and 
radio and television stations from central to local levels must 
all actively propagate the party's beliefs and political outlook 
and play a leading example. Meanwhile, they must be innovative, 
encourage variety in their newspaper, radio, and television 
broadcasting reporting styles with a view to forming a unique 
style. 
  In short, guiding people with correct public opinion means 
guiding people with public opinions that are conducive to 
further deepening reform and opening up; creating a socialist 
market economic system; developing socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; strengthening socialist spiritual civilization 
and socialist democratic and legal system; encouraging people to 
work arduously and explore and innovate for national wealth and 
strength, the people's happiness, and social progress; telling 
truth from falsity, upholding truth, good, and beauty, and 
resisting falsity, evil, and baseness; and helping the 
unification of the country and national unity, political, 
economic, and social stability. That way, we will definitely 
guide, protect, and develop the energy of the people and various 
circles; encourage and stimulate the people to be confident, 
unified in mind and heart, to be mindful of the overall 
situation, strive forward, tackle the key problems in this 
year's deepening reforms, and score greater achievements in 
economic development.

<F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "Molding People With Lofty Spirit"] </F>
  [Text] Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Fighters on 
the ideological front should all be engineers of the human 
soul." This is the high hope placed on comrades working on the 
propaganda and ideological front by the chief designer of 
China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive. 
  Reform and opening up over the past decade and more have 
greatly emancipated and developed China's social productive 
forces, while socialist economic construction has attained 
world-renowned accomplishments. The building of socialist 
spiritual civilization has also made new headway. Judging from 
the present situation of our practical work, however, we can see 
that many localities have failed, to varying degrees, to pay 
close attention to or make solid efforts in the building of 
spiritual civilization. Moreover, malpractices such as money 
worship, hedonism, and ultra-individualism have spread in 
society, the party style and the general social mood are not 
satisfactory, and corrupt phenomena have multiplied. A failure 
to put a resolute end to this situation and build a high degree 
of socialist spiritual civilization would lead to our failure to 
build up socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, 
molding people with lofty spirit means cultivating a new 
generation with lofty spirit. This is an arduous yet glorious 
task for the propaganda and ideological front. 
  What is the lofty spirit we are talking about? It is the 
spirit of serving the people heart and soul, which was advocated 
by Comrade Mao Zedong long ago; it is the spirit of "having 
ideals, moral standards, education, and discipline," which has 
been repeatedly stressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; it is the 
pioneering spirit summarized by Comrade Jiang Zemin, which 
reads: emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, making 
positive explorations, having the courage to open up new paths, 
carrying out hard struggles, pressing forward in the face of 
difficulties, learn from foreign countries, persistently relying 
on ourselves, being modest and prudent, guarding against 
conceitedness and rashness, working with concerted efforts, 
taking the overall situation into account, practicing thrift, 
being honest in performing official duties, devoting great 
efforts to making the country prosperous, and making selfless 
contributions. All of these spirits have not only given 
expression to the fine traditions of the communists, but have 
also carried forward the traditional virtues of our nation. As 
an embodiment of our valuable experience gained from the 
building of our country over a long period of time and marked by 
the distinctive features of our era, these spirits serve as 
powerful spiritual pillars for the building of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. In the future, we will strengthen 
ideological and moral education, which centers around 
patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; carry out education on 
building our country through hard struggle and thrift, on 
professional ethics, social morality, and basic national 
conditions; and do a good job in mass ideological work. 
  To mold people with lofty spirit, we need to integrate the 
work closely with realistic conditions, as well as with the 
goals and tasks of struggle put forward by our party. At 
present, the whole party and the people of the entire country 
are making vigorously efforts to implement the resolutions of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
seize favorable opportunities, deepen reform, expand opening up, 
step up development, maintain stability, and strive to build up 
a socialist market economic structure and bring about a fairly 
comfortable life by the end of this century. Ideological and 
moral education should obey and serve this overall situation. 
We are now cultivating people of a new type under open, not 
sealed, conditions. To reach our goal, we must carry out the 
spirit of patriotism, enhance the self-respect and 
self-confidence of our nation, and learn to recognize and resist 
the dross while using for reference and assimilating the essence 
of foreign cultures. 
  To mold people with lofty spirit, we need to deal with 
different people in different ways and should refrain from 
treating people with a fixed pattern. Because children, 
teenagers, and the youth are the hope and future of our 
motherland, we must further strengthen and improve education on 
their ideals, morality, and discipline. We should uphold the 
general direction while using different methods for different 
people. The concrete content and forms of education should suit 
the age and psychology of the young; in others word, we need to 
integrate practical with abstract concepts, history with 
reality, guidance with criticism, and words with action. By so 
doing, we can, on the one hand, help them gradually establish a 
correct outlook on the world, life, values, and morality, and 
take a correct road in life, and on the other hand, bring up 
reliable successors for our great socialist modernization cause. 
  Molding people with lofty spirit is a long-term and 
complicated social systematic project, which cannot be fulfilled 
with a little efforts by one or two departments; instead, the 
success of the work relies on the well-coordinated cooperation 
of all departments and links. As for the propaganda and 
ideological front, all departments concerned, including 
theoretical studies, education, press, publication, and 
literature and arts, should all give full play to their own 
unique functions and roles and make contributions to molding 
socialist people of a new type. Besides, strong coordination 
from law-enforcement departments is also indispensable. Without 
the coordination of law and discipline, education will be 
spiritless. Therefore, strict enforcement of law and discipline 
is an indispensable means of molding people. 
  Educators should first receive education. Leading cadres at 
all levels and the vast number of propaganda and ideological 
workers should first mold themselves with lofty spirit, make an 
exemplary role, and be honest in carrying out official duties. 
We should keep in mind the repeated exhortations of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping: "The greater efforts our party and government 
are making to implement various policies on economic reform and 
opening up, the greater attention our party members, especially 
the party's high-ranking cadres, need to pay to setting an 
example on cultivating Marxist ideology and morality. If we 
have disarmed ourselves ideologically, how can we educate the 
young generation and lead the country and people to build 
socialism?" 
  The building of a rich, democratic, and civilized modern 
socialist country is based on the struggle of many generations 
of socialist new people who have ideals, sound moral standards, 
education, and disciple. Through their arduous, solid, and 
fruitful labor, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front 
should be able to turn more party members into "four-have's" 
party members, more cadres into "four-have's" cadres, and more 
young people into "four-have's" youth, with the aim that they 
can commonly undertake the heavy tasks of history.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Inspire the People With </F>
Outstanding Literary Works"] 
  [Text] Inspiring the people with outstanding literary and 
artistic works is an important task put forward for the cultural 
front by the National Propaganda and Ideological Work 
Conference. Cultural work departments at all levels should pay 
close attention to this work and do it in a down-to-earth manner. 
  The appealing, edifying, and educational role of art and 
literature is reflected mainly by literary and artistic works. 
The practice of the various historical periods in which our 
party has led the masses in their struggles shows that 
outstanding literary and artistic works can play a tremendous 
and irreplaceable role in elevating the ideological realm of the 
masses, in encouraging them to be united and to struggle, and in 
promoting social progress. Therefore, producing outstanding 
literary and artistic works is the central issue in improving 
cultural work and in enriching socialist art and literature. 
  Different times put different demands on the content of 
outstanding literary and artistic works. Comrade Jiang Zemin's 
speech at the National Propaganda and Ideological Work 
Conference demanded that contemporary literary and artistic 
creations "augment the main theme" [hong yang zhu xuan lu 1738 
2254 0031 2467 1774]. So what is the main theme of our times? 
The following make up the main theme that drives us to progress 
and develop: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line; patriotic, collectivist, and socialist ideas and spirit; 
ideas and spirit that are conducive to reform and opening up, to 
the modernization drive, and to solidarity among the 
nationalities, social progress, and the well-being of the 
people; and all kinds of ideas and spirit that encourage 
striving for a good life through honest labor. 
  Propaganda departments and cultural work departments at all 
levels should make great efforts to properly plan and organize 
the production of literary and artistic works that reflect the 
main theme. They should stick to the orientation of "serving 
socialism and serving the people" and the principle of "letting 
a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought 
contend," creating a fine environment for the flourishing of 
literary and artistic creations. They should make meticulous 
plans for important literary and artistic activities, and for 
promoting the upgrading of creations. They should strive to 
produce a number of outstanding films, television programs, 
works of literature, dramas, songs and dances, operas, and art 
works that are loved by the masses so as to meet the daily 
increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the masses, arouse 
their enthusiasm and working vigor, and promote reform and 
opening up and the modernization drive. The "five-ones project" 
(each year, propaganda organs in various localities should 
produce one good book, one good drama, one outstanding film, one 
outstanding television drama series, and one or several 
convincing good articles that bring out original ideas,) 
implemented in recent years has played a positive promotional 
role in augmenting the main theme. Literary and artistic works 
that reflect the main theme also must participate actively in 
competition in the cultural market. This demands that these 
works be both outstanding in ideas and content, and excellent in 
form of expression and artistic manner. Only this can really 
attract and inspire people. It is necessary to make great 
efforts to plan and develop news and publications, radio and 
television broadcasting, literature and art, and social 
sciences, as well as all cultural undertakings -- including mass 
community culture, the culture of villages and small towns, 
enterprise culture, and campus culture -- thus laying a solid 
foundation for augmenting the main theme. It is necessary to 
continue to increase input in the sphere of propaganda and 
culture, and to further improve conditions for the development 
of propaganda and cultural undertakings. We should support and 
finance outstanding and elegant literary and artistic works. 
  While augmenting the main theme, we should pay attention to 
variety. The variety we are mean demands, on the one hand, that 
the literary and artistic works reflecting the main theme should 
be varied, interesting, and vivid in topic, form, style, and 
means of expression, and that they meet the many and multilevel 
cultural needs of the masses. Every work that educates and 
edifies the people, and that amuses and gives the enjoyment of 
beauty should have a place. 
  Cultural work must be deepened continuously in order to meet 
the needs of a developing socialist market economy. It is 
necessary to further deepen the structural reform of performing 
organizations and the reform of other cultural units, and to 
progress and make breakthroughs in them, and through reform, to 
bring into play the initiative for creation and performance. It 
is necessary to promote cultural legislation, to perfect the 
system of laws and regulations for the cultural market and the 
rules for market behavior, to continue unswervingly implementing 
the principle of "paying simultaneous attention to enriching 
culture and wiping out pornography," to vigorously straighten 
out various problems in the cultural market, and to wipe out 
unhealthy things. It is necessary to be good at using such 
forms as literary and artistic criticism and theoretical 
criticism to guide public opinion and to promote the healthy 
development of literary and artistic creation. In the course of 
promoting the development of the cultural market, propaganda and 
cultural organs at all levels must handle properly the 
relationship between the social efficacy and economic returns of 
literary and artistic works. It is proper and necessary to 
stress economic returns. If economic returns are good, they can 
promote the development of the cultural undertaking. However, 
the value of a spiritual product is reflected more importantly 
by its social efficacy. Therefore, we surely must foster the 
idea of considering the situation as a whole, consider questions 
by placing social efficacy first, and make efforts to achieve 
the integration of economic returns and social efficacy. 
  The broad masses are earnestly expecting the continuous 
production of inspiring, outstanding works. With the guidance 
of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, with a good contingent of writers and artists, 
and with the motivation of the lively and bustling lives of tens 
of thousands of people amid reform and construction, we believe 
the time surely will come when literature and art will flourish 
all the more! 
  The masses are the creators of history -- the masters of 
reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive. Our 
propaganda and ideological workers come from among the people 
and serve the people. They should learn from the people and 
rely heavily on them. "Arming people with scientific theories, 
guiding people with correct opinions, shaping people with a 
lofty spirit, and inspiring people with outstanding works" are 
important tasks for the propaganda and ideological front. In 
the final analysis, they represent the interests of the people 
and reflect their demands. Only by relying on the masses in 
everything and by respecting the will and the originality of the 
masses can we complete them well. We should always bear in mind 
the goal of wholeheartedly serving the people and continuously 
improving our political quality and professional expertise, and 
should work conscientiously and struggle hard in order to 
complete this great and glorious task entrusted to us by the 
great times!

<F P=106> [By XINHUA RIBAO commentator: "Correct Party Style Will Give </F>
Rise to Healthy Social Practices"] 
  [Text] Correct party style will lead to healthy social 
practices. The party style of a ruling party exerts a decisive 
and yet subtle influence on social practices. 
  Since its inception in 1921, our party has faithfully 
carried 
out its objective of serving the people wholeheartedly. It has 
believed in and relied on the people. In their interests, and 
advancing wave upon wave, it has vanquished imperialism, 
feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and spared no pains to do 
a good job in economic construction; thus winning the warm 
support, love, and esteem of the people, and establishing 
flesh-and-blood ties with them. Over a long period of 
revolutionary struggle and economic construction, the broad 
masses of party members have, with their staunch party spirit, 
strict discipline, selfless dedication, and edifying influence, 
given an impetus to hundreds of millions of people. The correct 
party style has thus given rise to sound practices among the 
people to lead simple and honest lives amid an harmonious 
atmosphere, and among people who are ever vigorous in spirit and 
intent to make progress. 
  In recent years, some party members and cadres, in 
particular 
a handful of party members and leading cadres who were unable to 
stand the trials of governing, reform, and opening up, gradually 
yielded to mammonism, hedonism, and extreme individualism. They 
made use of their power to gain selfish ends, lived in luxury, 
became corrupt and degenerate, hankered after fame and fortune, 
and to a certain extent, undermined party style and tarnished 
its image. The presence of decadent phenomenon within the party 
has exerted an undesirable influence and encouraged unhealthy 
practices, giving rise to the tendency of regarding money as 
all-important and caring for nothing but profit, or even 
bringing back to life some of the vicious phenomena that 
disappeared long ago. These kinds of phenomena not only run 
counter to socialist spiritual civilization, but also hamper 
economic development. 
  The people are realistic. First they come to know the party 
and evaluate it in light of the practices and actions of party 
members in their midst. When a Communist Party member raises 
his arm at a critical and trying moment when one's fate is 
hanging in the balance, he shouts: "I am a Communist Party 
member, follow me!" As soon as party members go forward, the 
people will follow suit. If a party member sees a woman being 
humiliated by a villain armed with a knife and turns a blind 
eye, staying away for fear that he may be unable to get away in 
time; if some party members and leading cadres come across a 
seriously ill patient who needs to be rushed to a hospital, but 
just ignore him and whiz by in a plush sedan; if, while the 
people are still toiling to find sufficient food and clothing, 
party members and cadres indulge themselves in feasting, what 
will they people think? How will they view it? How can we 
expect the people to gallantly rise for a just cause? How can 
we ask the people to unite and help one another? 
  Presently, some party members and cadres complain that the 
people are disobedient and hard to lead, that human hearts are 
not what they used to be in the old days, and social practices 
are no longer pure. Those complaining comrades should first 
examine the actual role being played by party organizations as 
fighting bastions under their leadership, and examine how their 
own party members are playing their exemplary vanguard role. 
Why is it that party members in places like Huaxi village under 
Jiangyin county, Qianzhou township under Wuxi city, and Jianhuai 
village under Huaian city do not have such complaints; and why 
can these people work with one heart and one mind with party 
members and cadres to carry out economic construction and 
spiritual civilization construction? The crux of the matter 
lies in that party organizations and members in these localities 
have been faithful to their objectives, have done practical work 
for the people, and worked for their benefit; such correct party 
style has naturally led to healthy social practices. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: The key to China's 
problems lies in doing a good job within the Communist Party. 
To establish simple and honest social practices, create a 
political environment marked by stability and unity, and 
organize hundreds of millions of people to work with concerted 
efforts to achieve the goal of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, first and foremost, we must eradicate all 
corrupt practices inside the party. Party organizations at all 
levels and every party member should further study the 
guidelines set out in the whole series of anticorruption 
documents issued by the party Central Committee; clearly 
understand the overall concept of the anticorruption drive 
launched by the party Central Committee and the party's 
short-term goals and current tasks, principles, and priorities; 
and try to unify our thinking and understanding, and actively 
plunge ourselves into the anticorruption struggle. We must, on 
this basis, resort to mobilizing and relying on the people to 
expose, lodge reports, and take measures against major cases in 
cooperation with specific organs according to the law, and 
firmly stamp out several unhealthy practices which the people 
are resentful of. At the same time, we must strengthen the 
management of education among party members, and constantly 
raise consciousness toward self-discipline, honest living, as 
well as the ability to fight corruption and handle any 
unfavorable turn of events among party members and cadres, 
particularly among leading cadres. The leadership and rank and 
file must work hand in hand to set party style right, and create 
a new situation with correct party style and healthy social 
practices.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Do a Good Job of Training and </F>
Fostering Cadres of Minority Nationalities--On How To Do a Good 
Job in Minority Nationalities Work at Present"] 
  [Text] With the cause of our socialist modernization 
advancing daily, it is the call of the times to concentrate 
efforts on training and fostering a contingent of ethnic 
minority cadres to meet the requirement of the new tasks under 
the new situation. 
  To select and train minority nationality cadres well, we 
must 
first deepen our understanding and clarify the guiding ideology 
and principal tasks of our work. 
  To select and train minority nationality cadres properly, we 
must take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics as our guidance, put into practice 
the party's nationality policies and the "Law on Regional 
National Autonomy," and, closely centering around the major task 
of economic construction, intensify the building of leading 
bodies according to the principle of "four transformations" for 
cadres--making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger 
in age, better educated, and more professionally competent, to 
train and foster a contingent of minority nationality cadres 
who: Have both ability and political integrity, will work 
honestly, and who can maintain close links with the masses of 
various nationalities with a complete range of specialities and 
well coordinated professions rationally formed to suit the needs 
of reform, opening up, and the development of the socialist 
market economy. To this end, it is necessary to: Proceed from 
the reality of the nationality regions, adopt effective 
measures, step up training and education, and further enhance 
the political and professional levels of the ethnic minority 
cadres; tap the sources and increase the number of cadres for 
special training in a planned way to replenish various kinds of 
scientific, technological, and management personnel and improve 
the structure of the ranks of nationality cadres; and to boldly 
select and use fine young and middle-aged cadres of minority 
nationalities, take great pains to enhance the ability of 
leading bodies at all levels in nationality regions to control 
the socialist market economy, and build leading bodies into 
staunch collectives adhering to the party's basic line, 
persisting in doing two types of work simultaneously, and having 
the ability to lead building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, providing an organizational guarantee for 
carrying out in-depth reform and promoting economic and social 
development for minority nationalities in nationality regions. 
  To train minority nationality cadres well, we must intensify 
training and education to comprehensively enhance the quality of 
minority nationality cadres. Education in political theory must 
be strengthened and education in Marxism, particularly Comrade 
Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, conducted universally among minority 
nationality cadres. Education in the party's nationality and 
religious policies must also be carried out to further elevate 
theoretical and political levels, set up Marxist concepts on 
nationality and religion, consciously safeguard the unification 
of the motherland and unity of all nationalities, and resolutely 
resist and oppose splitting and infiltratiion activities by 
antagonistic forces at home and abroad. At present, it is 
necessary to carry out the decision of the central authorities 
on studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping. We must enlist, in a planned and systematic 
manner, the vast numbers of minority nationality cadres, 
intermediate and senior cadres in particular, to study Comrade 
Deng's works conscientiously, put in a lot of time and energy to 
read the works in the original, and deeply understand and master 
the strategic ideology and theoretical views on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics in a bid to enhance the 
consciousness, steadfastness, and creativeness of implementing 
the party's basic line. In this regard, it is also necessary to 
vigorously conduct cultural, professional, and practical 
training. Party schools at all levels must really undertake the 
task of training cadres of minority nationalities. 
  In training nationality cadres, we must reinforce the 
building of grass-roots cadres in nationality regions. Cadres 
in townships and towns, and in township and town enterprises, 
are the backbone forces of agriculture and animal husbandry in 
nationality regions. Building up this contingent of cadres well 
is a necessity for the reinforcement of the party's grass-roots 
organizations and the state power at grass-roots level in 
nationality regions. It is also a foundation for selecting 
cadres at relatively higher levels. For this purpose, we must 
increase the number of grass-roots ethnic minority cadres and 
tap the sources for these cadres in a planned manner in light of 
the requirements for economic and social development in 
nationality regions. 
  When training minority nationality cadres, we must step up 
building a contingent of ethnic minority professional and 
technical cadres. In order to change from having insufficient 
economic, scientific, technological, and management minority 
nationality cadres, various localities and departments should, 
in light of the organizational reform, select a number of 
capable minority cadres suitable for doing economic work, to 
receive the necessary training in a planned way and then send 
them to work in economic departments or enterprises. To adapt 
to the requirement to transform operational mechanisms and 
institute a modern enterprise system, we must extensively search 
and enthusiastically train management personnel of minority 
nationalities for enterprises of various kinds and enhance their 
standard in operation and management. 
  To train and select minority nationality cadres well, we 
must 
select and assign leading cadres of minority nationalities 
properly. Leading bodies at all levels in the localities 
practicing national autonomy must select and assign minority 
nationality cadres in an appropriate manner in accordance with 
the "Law on Regional National Autonomy" and stipulations in 
pertinent documents. Minority cadres should be assigned work in 
leading bodies in provinces, prefectures, and counties with 
relatively large minority nationality populations; in minority 
nationality townships and towns with a relatively large minority 
nationality population; in departments closely related to the 
production and lives of minority nationalities; and in 
enterprises and institutions which have relatively more minority 
nationality staff and workers. Attention should also be paid to 
selecting and assigning minority nationality cadres to work in 
various departments of state organs at the central level. 
  Finally, to do a good job of training and selecting minority 
nationality cadres, we must stress the necessity to intensify 
leadership and ensure implementation of the above measures.

<F P=106> [By Chuan Hsun-che (0278 6061 5074): "Twenty Unsettled </F>
Major Cases That the CPC Has Failed to Crack"] 
  [Text]Rewards Ranging From 50,000 to 250,000 Yuan 
Offered for Cracking Cases 
  Did the society of China's mainland witness a peaceful and 
stable year in 1993? 
  Ten major unsettled criminal cases of the whole year have 
given an answer to this question. 
  These 10 major cases include damage done to, or attempts to 
damage, airports and bridges, and the discovery of inflammable 
matter in the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall and on the Tiananmen 
Rostrum. All these cases have shocked Zhongnanhai. 
  No matter whether or not they are of a political or 
nonpolitical nature, or whether or not they reflect the 
complaints of the people or give vent to personal spite, they 
all show that the society is not without trouble at all. Of 
course, millions upon millions of people who suffered under the 
rule of Mao Zedong will not erase their bitter hatred for Mao 
from their minds. 
  The Ministry of Public Security issued a special document 
"10 
Major Unsettled Criminal Cases and 10 Major Unsettled Economic 
Cases in 1993" to the public security departments (bureaus) of 
all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China 
on 5 January and urged all public security departments (bureaus) 
to strengthen cooperation, crack unsettled serious cases as soon 
as possible, and commend and award personnel who render 
meritorious service in cracking cases. It is learned that 
rewards offered for cracking unsettled cases range from 50,000 
to 250,000 yuan and personnel who have rendered meritorious 
service in cracking cases will be promoted one or two grades. 
<H5>  Ten Major Unsettled Criminal Cases </H5>
  The 10 unsettled major criminal cases in 1993 are as 
follows: 
  1. On 7 February, a section of 0.5 km of railway track of 
the Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway line near Hami, Xinjiang, was 
damaged and a train derailed resulting in a loss of over 2.2 
million and the death of six train crew. 
  2. On 12 February, a detachment of 12 public security forest 
patrol guards were attacked by some armed bandits in the Qingan 
area, Xiaoxinganling, Heilongjiang, and seven of the guards were 
killed. To date, the whereabouts of the bandits are still 
unknown. 
  3. On 3 April, the military warehouse of a certain unit in 
Huainan City, Anhui Province, was burned and damaged. Three 
armed policemen were killed and their guns were taken away. 
This incident incurred a loss of over 3 million yuan. 
  4. In the middle of June, more than 10 rooms for delegates 
to the provincial party congress of the Yingze Guesthouse of the 
Shanxi Provincial CPC Committee were looted and the gang that 
committed the crime has not yet been brought to justice. 
  5. On 23 June, a motor-driven ship reported to be missing 
was found in Yichang at the middle reach of Chang Jiang and in 
the cabin, more than 100 kg of powerful explosive with timers 
and detonators were discovered. 
  6. On the evening of 5 August, the power supply to the Simao 
Airport of Yunnan Province was cut off, two armed policemen were 
killed, and two airplanes were damaged. The gang that committed 
the crime fled in a military car. To date, their whereabouts 
are still unknown. 
  7. On the afternoon of 5 September, two bottles of 
inflammable liquid in plastic bottles for mineral water were 
discovered at the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall. Similar inflammable 
liquid was also found on the Tiananmen Rostrum in the evening of 
the same day. Afterward, a public security department received 
a call from an organization which claimed to be anti-Mao 
claiming responsibility for the liquid. 
  8. In early September, the party and government organs and 
public security departments of six major cities of China 
received the "Declaration of the National Action Committee" 
stating the committee wanted to thoroughly settle the accounts 
of Mao Zedong's crimes, to close down Mao Zedong Memorial Halls, 
the Old Home of Mao Zedong, and to take actions to this end. 
  9. On 2 October, 200 kg of explosive made by indigenous 
method was found tied below the raft at the Hankou pier of the 
Wuhan Chang Jiang Bridge. On the same day, a similar bag of 
explosive together with a detonator and an igniter were also 
found on an abandoned wooden boat at the Nanjing Bridge. 
  10. On the evening of 21 November, a team of armed policemen 
were patrolling the suburbs of Zaozhuang City when a minibus 
made a crashed into them killing three and wounding one. The 
criminals who committed the crime abandoned their car and fled. 
It is thought that more than two criminals were involved in the 
case. 
<H5>  Ten Major Unsettled Economic Cases </H5>
  The 10 major unsettled economic cases in 1993 are as 
follows: 
  1. A total of over $23 million and over 31 million yuan of 
25 import and export companies of Guangdong Province was 
remitted abroad or carried away from China by economic suspects. 
  2. A bank in Huiyang was defrauded of $4.2 million by a 
joint venture company with forged bills, contracts, and letters 
of credit. Later investigation proved that the so-called joint 
venture company was not registered and the personnel involved 
were bogus. 
  3. The People's Construction Bank of China in Shaanxi 
Province gave a credit loan of 16 million yuan to a 
transprovincial cooperative building company and a former member 
of the Standing Committee of the Central Advisory Commission and 
the Shaanxi governor acted as guarantors. Upon verification in 
August, the company was found to be bankrupt and the whereabouts 
of 7 million yuan was unknown. The chairman of the board of 
directors and the general manager were missing. 
  4. A so-called foreign-invested enterprise drew 2.15 million 
yuan by fraud from a bank in Nanjing City on 20 September, 
bought a large quantity of knit goods, and sent them to Hong 
Kong. At present, the whereabouts of the culprits are still 
unknown. 
  5. A trading, import, and export company in Zhuhai City paid 
on several occasions a total of 5.8 million Hong Kong dollars 
cash to a Taiwan businessman as earnest money for buying 
instruments. It was found later that there was no such company 
and the person was missing. 
  6. More than 6.4 million yuan of the sum for 2,500 tonnes of 
reinforcing bars for construction was obtained by fraud by a 
Sino- foreign joint venture building material company with 
forged bank drafts and checks. The personnel involved are 
missing. 
  7. A bank in Sichuan granted an interest-free loan of 16 
million yuan to a company in Zhaoqing, Guangdong, for land 
profiteering. When the loan was overdue in the middle of 
November, the company had been closed, and the whereabouts of 
the personnel were unknown. 
  8. A branch bank in Taiyuan City discovered on 3 November 
that 1.3 million yuan and $100,000 had been stolen and the two 
persons in charge were missing. 
  9. It is suspected that a total of 2.48 million yuan and 1.8 
million Hong Kong dollars was drawn with forged checks on eight 
occasions from three banks in Fujian Province during the period 
from 1 to 3 November by the same bogus company. 
  10. The Datong Coal Mining Bureau of Shanxi Province was 
defrauded of 100,000 tonnes of fine-quality coal by a company in 
Hubei Province by means of reselling the coal. The person 
handling the matter and the person in charge of the purchasing 
company fled with the money.

"Due to Pressure From Central Television Station Through the 
State Council, the Sports Channel of Beijing Television Station 
Suspends Broadcasting as of Today"] 
  [Text] The sports channel of Beijing Cable Television, 
which mainly broadcast overseas sports events, will suspend 
broadcasting as of today according to an order issued by the 
State Council. On the surface, this was because the channel 
violated the satellite television transmission management rules. 
In fact, this was because the sports programs broadcast by the 
Central Television Station met with a challenge. 
  The sports channel of Beijing Cable Television was 
originally 
designed to relay the sports events broadcast by the United 
States' ESPN, and the channel broadcast programs from noon to 
0300 next morning every day. Although the Central Television 
Station has also broadcast overseas sports events for a long 
time, it mainly broadcasts recorded and edited programs, so its 
effects were not as attractive as the live broadcasting via 
satellite by the cable television channel. The sports-loving 
audience was attracted to the cable television channel, and this 
threatened the programs broadcast by the Central Television 
Station. So it exerted pressure on Beijing Television through 
the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television of the State 
Council. It is learned that because the Central Television 
Station is directly subordinate to the Ministry of Radio, Film, 
and Television of the State Council, while Beijing Television is 
subordinate to the Beijing Municipal Government, the lower-level 
local institution cannot match the power of the upper-level 
central institution. In such circumstances, the sports channel 
of Beijing Television which relays live broadcasts of overseas 
sports events was suspended on the grounds that the relay was 
not approved and thus violated the satellite television programs 
management rules. 
  Last August, Chinese mainland authorities promulgated the 
rules on managing satellite transmitted television programs, 
which prohibit people and institutions from installing satellite 
television antennas to receive foreign satellite programs 
without the approval of the authorities concerned. Those who 
violate this rule may be fined 5,000 yuan. A few days before 
the suspension of Beijing Cable Television's sports channel, the 
screen continuously printed the State Council's order on 
suspending the broadcasting of the channel. Because the 
suspension was an abrupt action, the cable television station 
did not give any explanation.

<F P=106> ["Chen Huanyou's Speech at the Provincial Work Conference on </F>
Discipline Inspection and Supervision"] 
  [Text] Comrades: 
  This provincial work conference on discipline inspection and 
supervison is convened under the new situation in which the 
entire province is earnestly implementing the guidelines of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
Seventh (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the Eighth Jiangsu 
Provincial CPC Committee and is accelerating the establishment 
of a socialist market economic system. The standing committee 
of the provincial party committee has attached great importance 
to this conference and in particular has heard and studied 
reports presented to it. At the conference, Comrade Keming 
delivered a work report in which he reviewed and summed up 
Jiangsu's work in discipline inspection and supervision in 1993 
and laid down arrangements for the work to fight corruption and 
promote honest practices for 1994, with which I agree 
completely. Now, I would like to state some opinions based on 
discussions by the standing committee of the provincial party 
committee. 
<H3>  I. Conscientiously Review Experience in Discipline 
Inspection and Supervision in 1993 and Correctly Analyze the 
Current Situation of the Anticorruption Struggle. </H3>
  Jiangsu maintained sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
growth last year; the general situation was good. Jiangsu also 
intensified discipline inspection and supervision and has in 
particular done a great deal of work to achieve periodic results 
in promoting the anticorruption struggle. This has produced a 
positive influence on reform, development, and stability and 
made new contributions to the overall work of the province. On 
behalf of the provincial party committee and government, I 
hereby extend my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to the 
broad masses of discipline inspection and supervisory workers 
throughout the province and my warm congratulations to advanced 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs and outstanding 
discipline inspection and supervisory cadres commended by the 
provincial party committee and government. 
  Since the beginning of 1993, party committees and 
governments 
at various levels throughout the province have followed the 
arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the provincial 
party committee to earnestly intensify discipline inspection and 
supervision and promote improvements in party work style and 
building clean government while proceeding with economic 
construction, reform, and opening up. Particularly since late 
August, they have firmly implemented the CPC Central Committee 
and State Council decision concerning the anticorruption 
struggle in the near future and the guidelines of the Second 
Plenary Session of the Commission for Discipline Inspection 
under the CPC Central Committee. They have made timely 
mobilization and arrangements to earnestly strengthen their 
guidance. Meanwhile, discipline inspection and supervisory 
organs as well as political and legal departments at various 
levels have conscientiously exercised their duties and actively 
launched efforts to ensure sound and orderly progress in the 
anticorruption struggle. According to the requirements of the 
CPC Central Committee and the provincial party committee, 
leading party and government cadres at and above the county 
(department) level have conscientiously initiated 
self-inspection and self- correction and have generally enhanced 
the consciousness of observing clean standards and 
self-discipline. Overcoming obstruction and resistance, 
discipline inspection, supervisory, and judicial organs have 
concentrated their efforts in emphatically investigating and 
handling a number of major cases as well as punishing a group of 
corrupt people. In the meantime, all businesses and enterprises 
run by party and government organs were screened throughout the 
province; all unwarranted charges were screened and rectified; 
all overseas tours at the public expense were also screened and 
rectified at the request of the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council. Proceeding from actual situations, many 
localities and departments took effective measures to settle 
problems that the people strongly resented. Through unified 
anticorruption struggle, party and government cadres at various 
levels have become more aware of the importance of the 
anticorruption struggle and have enhanced their consciousness of 
the principle of promoting material civilization and socialist 
ethics at the same time; thus the trend of spreading negative 
and corrupt phenomena were effectively checked, party work style 
and general practice in society were improved, and remarkable 
achievements were made, at this phase, in the three tasks of the 
anticorruption struggle in the near term. 
  However, we should soberly realize that the achievements 
scored in the anticorruption struggle are only preliminary and 
are far from sufficient compared with the people's expectations 
and the demands of the CPC Central Committee and the provincial 
party committee. Progress and achievements in work among 
various areas and departments are not balanced. Some areas and 
departments failed to strictly enforce discipline and were slack 
in dealing with corruption cases. We still need to consolidate 
our achievements in the anticorruption struggle. Under this 
circumstance, if we are a little slack in our ideology and work, 
corruption will repeatedly recur. As the situation develops and 
reform deepens, we will encounter many new situations and 
problems which we will need to study and solve. Anticorruption 
and promoting a clean administration are very heavy and 
formidable tasks. We must not overestimate our achievements; 
still less should we be satisfied with the accomplishments of 
the former stage of the anticorruption struggle. We must remain 
sober-minded and further deepen the anticorruption struggle. 
<H3>  II. Further Define the Guiding Ideology for Discipline 
Inspection and Supervision Work To Give It Full Play </H3>
  To comprehensively carry out the party's basic line and the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, seize opportunity, 
deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, quicken the 
pace of building a socialist market economic structure, and 
strive for greater victories in the cause of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics are great historical tasks faced by the 
whole party. According to the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the actual 
situation in our province, the Seventh (Enlarged) Plenary 
Session of the Eighth Provincial CPC Committee further defined 
the goal and ways of thinking for future reform, opening up, and 
economic development in Jiangsu. According to the tasks set by 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, our 
province must attain two major goals by the end of this century: 
First, within five years, we should establish a basic framework 
for the socialist market economic structure; second, on the 
basis of our doubling our gross provincial product [GPP] ahead 
of schedule in 1993 for the second time, we should double our 
GPP again by the end of this century. In this way we will lift 
Jiangsu's economy to a new level, and the people in our province 
will be able to lead a fairly comfortable life sooner. The new 
situation and tasks set new, higher demands for discipline 
inspection and supervision work. Party committees, governments, 
discipline inspection, and supervision organs at all levels must 
further define the guiding ideology for discipline inspection 
and supervision to unswervingly serve reform and opening up, 
economic construction, and social stability. 
  It is necessary to actively explore new thinking and new 
approaches to strengthen work related to discipline inspection 
and supervision under the new situation of economic development 
and socialist market economy; put forward new demands on modes 
of thinking and the code of ethics of party members and cadres; 
and continue to promote building party style and clean 
government in a bid to create a better social and political 
environment. It is only under an environment characterized by 
political and social stability and with a fine work style that 
we will be able to steadily promote reform; achieve sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic development, and enable our people 
to live and work in peace and contentment. As workers involved 
in discipline inspection and supervision, we have an important 
duty to create such an environment. We should view problems 
from a lofty, overall perspective to secure a better 
understanding of the importance of discipline inspection and 
supervision and thus a more definite guiding thought. 
  To meet overall demands this year, personnel involved in 
discipline inspection and supervision should intensify 
supervision and inspection related to implementation of party 
line, principles, policies, major party and government policy 
decisions, and important state laws to uphold the authority of 
the party Central Committee and to ensure smooth enforcement of 
government decrees. This year will be a crucial year for the 
establishment of a socialist market economic system, and 
momentum to be gathered and measures to be taken in reform will 
be unprecedented. Work related to discipline inspection and 
supervision should unfold according to guidelines set by both 
the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
Seventh (Enlarged) Plenum of the Eighth Provincial CPC 
Committee. We should tighten party and government discipline; 
firmly reject noncompliance with decrees and prohibitions, 
selfish departmentalism, decentralism, and local protectionism; 
check the unhealthy tendency of going against the party's 
democratic centralism; and strictly investigate and punish 
various erroneous actions interfering with and impeding the 
implementation and enforcement of party line, principles, 
policies, and major reform measures, so as to guarantee 
successful reform and healthy economic development. Building 
party style and clean government and the struggle against 
corruption should be carried out in such a way that the 
provincial party committee's major missions for this year will 
be accomplished and a successful reform and construction 
guaranteed. 
  Party committees and governments at all levels should 
strengthen leadership over work related to discipline inspection 
and supervision by taking the job as an important part of our 
overall mission. We should put forward demands and arrange work 
assignments regularly and support discipline inspection and 
supervision organs in carrying out their duties, particularly in 
investigating and punishing major cases, conducting special 
operations, and rectifying unhealthy practices. In addition, we 
should pay attention to personnel training in discipline 
inspection and supervision organs and help them solve practical 
problems, including improvement of working and living conditions. 
<H3>  III Continue Fighting Corruption; Further Improve 
Party Style Regarding concrete tasks to be carried out 
in Jiangsu this year in fighting corruption and building party 
style and clean government, on which Comrade Keming has already 
made wide-ranging arrangements, I would like to emphasize three 
points. </H3>
  1. It is necessary to enhance understanding on 
anticorruption 
through proper study. Practice in many localities and units on 
fighting corruption and promoting clean government has proved 
that firmness in attacking corruption lies in understanding, 
particularly among the leading cadres. When understanding is 
enhanced, firm action will follow. In the meantime, we should 
organize leading cadres and cadres involved in discipline 
inspection and supervision at various levels to continue their 
conscientious study of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" and use his expositions on correcting party style, 
promoting clean government, and fighting corruption to further 
unify thinking and enhance understanding. These are 
prerequisites to deepening the anticorruption drive. 
  It should be well understood that the principle of "being 
firm in attending to both material progress and cultural and 
ideological progress" serves as an important part of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The deeper reform and opening up goes, the 
faster the pace of establishing a socialist market economic 
system, the more the economy is advancing, the more we need to 
fight corruption and strengthen party style and clean 
government. We should sum up struggles against corruption 
launched earlier and through such review further enhance the 
understanding of leading cadres at various levels on the great 
importance of fighting corruption. Party schools at various 
levels should make honest government and the anticorruption 
struggle a basic subject to be taught on a long-term basis. In 
this respect, discipline inspection and supervision organs may 
compile teaching materials in cooperation with other relevant 
departments. Through rotational cadre training programs and 
regular education we should be able to continuously strengthen 
the resistance of party members and cadres to various negative 
influences, prompting them to voluntarily wage struggle against 
corrupt phenomena. 
  2. To meet the requirements of the Central Committee and the 
provincial party committee, we should properly implement the 
three tasks set for fighting corruption. As far as the 
anticorruption campaign and promoting party style and clean 
government are concerned, the party Central Committee and the 
State Council have clear provisions -- from guiding thoughts, 
policies, and principles to missions -- with emphasis on doing 
three tasks well in the near future. In this regard, proper 
arrangements were made by the work meeting and the Seventh 
(Enlarged) Plenary Session of the Eighth Provincial CPC 
Committee held last year. Party committees at all levels should 
further strengthen leadership. Party and government leaders 
should assume personal responsibility to accomplish missions set 
by the Central Committee and the provincial party committee; 
consolidate and broaden periodic results; and persist in pushing 
ahead building party style and clean government and in fighting 
corruption. First, we must make sure that party and government 
leaders at various levels are honest and self-disciplined. 
Leading cadres at various levels, particularly party and 
government leaders at the county (department) level and above, 
should strictly implement relevant stipulations of the Central 
Committee and the provincial party committee by setting a good 
leadership example in practicing honesty and self-discipline. 
Honesty and self-discipline among leading cadres is a 
self-motivated action based on firm party spirit. In the course 
of developing a socialist market economy, leading cadres at 
various levels should firmly bear in mind the party's 
objectives, namely performing their official duties honestly and 
working hard for the benefit of the people. We must see to it 
that, at any time and under any circumstances, we must be able 
to clearly differentiate and separate right from wrong and 
public from private, perpetuate the purity and progressiveness 
of the Communists, and regulate our conduct with strict party 
discipline and state policies and laws. Second, we should step 
up investigations of major cases and punishment of corrupt 
elements by adhering to the well-defined guidelines set by the 
central authorities that emphasize concentration, firmness, and 
seriousness. Party and government leaders at various levels 
should resolutely support discipline inspection, supervision, 
and procuratorial and judicial departments in handling cases 
according to law and discipline, lending them a helping hand in 
resisting interference and obstruction. In the meantime, good 
knowledge of the limits of policy is essential, and all 
investigations should base on facts and laws to ensure fairness. 
Investigation results of major cases bearing on public 
interests should be selectively publicized to motivate the 
people and educate the cadres and the masses. 
  Third, we should continue to tackle some special problems 
in our efforts to correct unhealthy practices. Tackling special 
problems is important work in the anticorruption struggle, so we 
must carry it out step by step and in a planned way. At the 
present time we should focus on achieving success in tackling 
special problems. We should pay attention to improving the 
party's workstyle and promoting honesty in performing official 
duties and to consolidating our achieved results. While 
tackling the above-mentioned problems, we should also make 
efforts to investigate problems which have evoked strong 
repercussions among the masses and propose plans to solve those 
problems in the spirit of seeking truth from facts in light of 
the actual situation in various localities and departments. If 
we can persist in tackling those problems, we will certainly be 
able to achieve continuous and new successes. 
  3. We should attach importance to improving the party's work 
style and being honest in performing official duties during the 
festival period. The Spring Festival will arrive soon. Whether 
we spend a happy, clean, and honest festival will be a practical 
measure of the results of our anticorruption struggle during the 
earlier period. It will also be a practical matter of whether we 
can win the people's confidence. Various localities and 
departments must firmly implement the guidelines of the 
"circular on strictly forbidding the use of public funds for 
feasting, buying gifts or indulging in extravagance during the 
New Year and Spring Festival period in 1994" issued by the 
general offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council and the opinions of the general offices of the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government on 
implementing the circular's guidelines. We should simplify 
meetings. Meetings which can be canceled must be resolutely 
canceled, and meetings which are necessary should be conducted 
in a frugal manner. We should strictly control various 
celebration and commendation activities and vigorously advocate 
civilized, thrifty, and simple customs. Various localities must 
firmly cease doing all things clearly forbidden in the Central 
Committee circular. We should pay particular attention to 
stopping the practice of using public funds to eat and drink 
without restraint, buy gifts, to wantonly distribute procurement 
and gift coupons. Leading cadres at various levels, especially 
leading groups at the provincial level, should take the lead in 
setting good examples and be responsible for improving units 
under their jurisdiction. They should do a good job in 
improving the party's work style and ensuring honesty in their 
respective localities and departments. Party organizations and 
discipline inspection and supervision organizations at all 
levels should strengthen inspection and supervision and promptly 
stop and correct phenomena that violate regulations. They 
should criticize and educate units that violate regulations and 
deal strictly with cases of serious violation of regulations. 
We should consolidate the results of the anticorruption 
struggle by doing a good job in improving the party's workstyle 
and promoting honesty during the festival period. 
  It is hoped that in the new year the broad masses of cadres 
belonging to discipline inspection and supervision organizations 
and judicial departments at various levels in the province will 
stive to improve themselves, further heighten their spirit, work 
in a solid manner, improve the party's work style, promote 
honesty in performing official duties, unfold the anticorruption 
struggle, and make new contributions to ensuring the successful 
accomplishment of the goals of reform and development in this 
province!

<F P=106> [By reporter Qiu Hongbo (6726 3163 3134): "It Is Necessary </F>
to Give Top Priority To Safeguarding the Capital's Political 
Stability and Social Order"] 
  [Text] A two-day municipal meeting on judicial and security 
work ended on 2 February. The meeting relayed the guidelines of 
the national meeting on judicial and security work, summarized 
last year's judicial and security work in Beijing, and made 
arrangements for this year's work. Chen Xitong, secretary of 
the municipal party committee, stressed: This year, all 
professions and trades in the municipality must regard the 
safeguarding of the capital's political stability and social 
order as a matter of prime importance. Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan 
and Chen Yiping, deputy secretary general of the Central 
Political and Legal Commission, attended the meeting and made 
speeches. 
  At the meeting, Wang Tong, member of the standing committee 
of the municipal party committee and secretary of the municipal 
political and legal committee, made a report entitled "Implement 
the Guidelines of the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, Go All Out To Safeguard the Capital's Political 
Stability and Social Order, and Make Even Greater Contributions 
to Helping the People Become Relatively Well-off." 
  It is learned that last year, political and legal 
departments 
in the municipality conscientiously implemented the guidelines 
of the 14th CPC Congress, persisted in the party's basic line, 
further emancipated the mind, strengthened and reformed the 
judicial and security work, gave full play to their functions 
and role, and safeguarded the capital's political stability and 
social order in coordination with various other departments 
under the support of the broad masses of the people. As a 
result, a fine social environment and legal guarantee were 
provided for reform, opening up, and economic development, a 
marked progress was made in improving the style of thinking and 
the style of work among the ranks of judicial, procuratorial, 
and court workers, and the goal of "making this year's work 
better than last year's" was attained. 
  Li Qiyan said: The capital's judicial and security work is 
very important. The good result achieved in this work last 
year was ascribed to the hard work of the comrades on the 
political and legal fronts. In this new year, our tasks on 
reform and development are heavy, while our tasks on judicial 
and security work are even heavier. To successfully accomplish 
these tasks, we should first of all emancipate the mind and 
focus the judicial and security work on ensuring the creation of 
a peaceful and stable social environment and ensuring the even 
faster development of the economy. We hope that the comrades of 
judicial and security fronts will enhance understanding, work 
hard, and use practical actions to ensure that the party's basic 
line is truly implemented in Beijing and ensure that Beijing 
will do all its work in an even better manner, with economic 
construction as the central link. 
  Chen Xitong said in his speech: We must pay attention to 
maintaining the capital's political stability and social order 
by regarding it as the matter of prime importance. This is the 
most important task of all professions and trades in the 
municipality. This year, our country will set forth major 
measures for reform, and reform has entered the new stage of 
pressing ahead in an all-round way and making breakthroughs in 
key areas. Currently, our country's situation is very good, and 
the people throughout the country are high-spirited and working 
vigorously, thus setting off a new upsurge of construction. To 
ensure the implementation of reform measures and the even faster 
development of the economy, a peaceful and stable social 
environment is indispensable. Therefore, the capital must 
achieve success in safeguarding political stability and 
maintaining social order. 
  He added: The capital's work concerning public order must be 
grasped further. Generally speaking, Beijing's situation in 
public order is good, but it still lags behind the demand. 
Thus, we cannot be satisfied with it. The work concerning 
public order is the matter with which all the people should be 
concerned. We should pay attention to tackling the problems 
concerning public order in a comprehensive way and truly set up 
a network of mass participation in preventing and controlling 
crimes. We should also successfully maintaining public order to 
ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. 
  Chen Xitong said in conclusion: Party committees and 
governments at all levels must assume responsibility for 
security work and introduce strict responsibility system. Party 
committees and governments at all levels should be responsible 
for maintaining social order and stability, and whenever there 
are problems, they should be ready to face and tackle them. We 
should set up strict responsibility system to make all 
departments and regions to be responsible for "defending the 
land." This is the only way to mobilize the initiative of the 
masses. 
  Also attending the meeting were leaders Yang Chaoshi, Meng 
Zhiyuan, Feng Mingwei, Shen Rendao, Sheng Liangang, Su 
Zhongxiang, He Fangbo, and Fan Yuanmou.

<F P=106> [By Robert MacPherson] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, Feb 9 (AFP) -- China's controversial 
Three Gorges hydroelectric dam on the Chang Jiang River could be 
scaled down or shelved if its number-one advocate, Premier Li 
Peng, falls from political grace, a British expert on the 
project said Wednesday. "If there was a significant change in 
political leadership, I don't think anybody would really want to 
develop the Three Gorges dam in the same way Li Peng has said," 
Patrick O'Reilly of London's School of Oriental and African 
Studies said. "I think it could get scaled down. I think it 
could even be sidelined," he told a Foreign Correspondents Club 
luncheon. 
  Li, a Soviet-trained electrical engineer who belongs to 
Beijing's conservative faction, is widely seen as the driving 
force behind the 20-year, 10 billion US dollar attempt to 
harness China's longest and mightiest river. Last weekend Li 
presided over the inauguration of another of his pet projects, 
the Daya Bay nuclear power plant, northeast of Hong Kong, built 
with French technology for four billion US dollars. Political 
analysts say his future will be cast in doubt in the power 
struggle that is certain to emerge in Beijing after the death of 
China's present senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who is 89. 
  Once mooted by Mao Zedong, the Three Gorges project was 
approved by China's parliament, the National People's Congress, 
in 1992, a year after devastating floods swept the fertile lower 
half of the Chang Jiang. So big is its size -- 185 meters 
(yards) high by nearly two kilometers (1-1/4 miles) wide -- that 
O'Reilly called it "the last Stalinist infrastructure project" 
in the world. In political terms, Beijing is looking upon the 
18,200-megawatt dam as a way to break provincial-level control 
of China's power generating capacity, said O'Reilly, who is 
preparing a doctoral thesis on the venture. It also hopes to use 
it to create a new, east-west "axis" of development along the 
Chang Jiang -- stretching from coastal Shanghai to inland 
Chongqing city -- to counter-balance the fast-growing South 
China coast, he said. Most of its electricity output is to go 
downriver, mainly to Shanghai. 
  But resistance to the project remains strong inside China, 
O'Reilly noted. Sichuan province, on the west side of the dam, 
is unhappy that it will get only 10 percent of its electricity 
output, but 80 percent of the 1.13 million river-dwellers to be 
displaced by its construction. 
  There are also strong doubts among China's own 
professionals, 
even though O'Reilly said the country has the expertise to get 
the job done. "When we talk to engineers off the record, 
they're all saying, `Look, it shouldn't be built, but if we're 
told it's got to happen, it's got to happen'," the scholar said. 
  Impoverished peasants now trying to eke a living from the 
barren slopes upriver from the dam could also emerge as a 
political force to be reckoned with if their relocation to new 
plots of land is badly handled. If the peasants refused to move 
in protest, they could gain political support from other 
disgruntled groups in Chinese society, such as students, 
O'Reilly said. Other outspoken Three Gorges opponents include 
dissident intellectuals who were forced underground after the 
ill-fated Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989. 
  Many critics say China's pressing energy needs could be 
dealt 
with more effectively, and with less cost and damage to the 
environment, with smaller dams along the Chang Jiang's many 
tributaries.

<F P=106> [By Xiang Jingquan (7309 6975 3123): "Review and Prospects </F>
of the Development of the National Economy in China"] 
  [Text]A Year of Continued High-Speed Development 
  The year 1993 was a year of high-speed development for the 
national economy in China. According to estimates of 
departments concerned, there was an overall development in 
various spheres of production, circulation, distribution, 
consumption, and other social reproduction, and there were large 
increases in major economic targets compared with those of 1992. 
  The GNP that reflected the development of social production 
reached approximately 3 trillion yuan for the whole year, an 
increase of about 13 percent compared with that of 1992. 
Industry, agriculture, post and telecommunications, and 
transportation achieved rapid growth. 
  The scale of economic construction expanded, and production 
capacity increased. The scale of investments in fixed assets of 
the whole society in 1992 reached about 1.13 trillion yuan, an 
increase of 49 percent compared with that of 1992, of which the 
margin of increase in investments in capital construction and 
renovation and transformation of state-owned organizations was 
about 60 percent, and a number of key construction projects were 
built. 
  Domestic and foreign markets further expanded, and the total 
volume of domestic and foreign trade greatly increased. The 
total amount of social commodity retail sales at home for the 
whole year reached about 1.35 trillion yuan, an increase of 
about 23 percent compared with that of 1992, the fastest 
increase in recent years. The total amount of import and export 
trade reached about 192 billion dollars, an increase of about 16 
percent compared with that of the previous year. 
  Social financial resources increased by a margin. The 
situation of state revenue was better than that of the previous 
year. It was estimated that revenue for the whole year would 
exceed budget. There were large increases in extra-budgetary 
revenue and expenditure calculated by comparable requirements 
compared with those of the previous year. As the residents' 
savings and various kinds of deposits continued to grow, the 
scale of bank loans was estimated to increase by about 20 
percent compared with that of 1992. 
  The living standard of the people was further raised and 
improved. Gross wages increased by about 21 percent compared 
with those of the previous year. The average wages of staff and 
workers grew by about 20 percent. There were some increases in 
the peasants' income following the growth of production and 
improvement in the work of purchasing agricultural products. 
<H3>  II. Development Depends on Reform and Opening-Up and 
Macroeconomic Regulation and Control </H3>
  The reform of the transformation of operational mechanism of 
state-owned enterprises in China in the year 1993 was further 
intensified. China made the best use of time to implement the 
"Provision Regarding the Transformation of Operational Mechanism 
of Industrial Enterprises of Ownership by the Whole People," 
started carrying out the reform of the property rights system 
and its form of operation, thus strengthening the market 
principal position of enterprises, and took the first step 
toward building the system of modern enterprises. 
  Pricing reform has made new development in the stage of 
storming fortifications. Over 90 percent of the counties 
(cities) in China have lifted restrictions on the selling prices 
of grain and edible oil, and on ex-factory prices of iron and 
steel products and some kinds of coal successively, increased 
railway freight transport prices, carried out agency prices of 
important commodities, and further expanded the role of market 
mechanism. 
  The reform of government organizations was pushed ahead, the 
intervention by the government in enterprise operations was 
weakened, and the functions of macroeconomic management were 
strengthened. 
  New progresses were made in other fields of reform, such as 
the rural reform, the social insurance system reform, and the 
housing system reform. 
  The high-speed economic development in 1993 was achieved due 
to China's further expansion of opening to the outside world. 
There appeared new high tides of drawing foreign investments in 
1993. Nearly 70,000 projects of investments by foreign 
businessmen were approved in the whole year, more than double 
that of the previous year, and direct investments by foreign 
businessmen actually drawn amounted to approximately 18 billion 
dollars, registering an increase of over 60 percent compared 
with those of the previous year. The rate of technological 
import quickened. The number of technological import contracts 
signed during the year increased by about 40 percent compared 
with that of the previous year, and a greater number of modern 
technological equipment and new raw and processed materials were 
imported. Moreover, open districts in China further increased, 
which created a new open pattern of multiple levels, multiple 
channels, and multiple directions. 
  At the end of 1992 and in the first few months of 1993, some 
phenomena of overheating and confusion of economic order 
appeared in China's economic development, and the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council adopted a number of measures for 
strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and 
control, which reduced the temperature of the real estate fever, 
the development zone fever, and the fever of fundraising by 
stocks that affected the overall situation, and relaxed the 
overall tension of funds and materials. Inflation was curbed to 
some extent, and the economy rapidly embarked on the track of 
high-speed and healthy development. 
<H5>  III. Problems That Admit No Negligence Still Exist </H5>
  In 1993, China made achievements in the development of the 
national economy that attracted worldwide attention, but there 
were also problems that admitted no negligence. 
  First, the situation of imbalance in the total amount of 
supply and demand still existed. After the strengthening of 
macroeconomic regulation and control, the imbalance took a 
favorable turn, but the balance of general supply larger than 
general demand for the whole year still deviated from the 
basically normal range. It was mainly due to the fact that the 
scale of fixed assets investments in the first half of the year 
grew by as high as 61 percent. Although there was certain 
control in the second half of the year, it still stayed at 40 
percent. Therefore, the investment scale for the whole year 
still grew by 49 percent compared with that of the previous 
year. Moreover, there were excessive increases in some regions 
and among some strata, which exceeded the growth of production. 
In addition, there was an imbalance between import and export, 
and the deficit of import larger than export was too great. 
  Second, structural contradictions still stood out sharply. 
It was mainly caused by a decrease in agricultural input, and 
little improvement in the conditions of agricultural production. 
Therefore, agriculture still could not meet the requirements of 
high-speed development of the national economy. Energy and 
communications remained extremely tense, the proportion of 
investments in these fields decreased, and certain processing 
industries were still developing too rapidly. 
  Third, the increase margin of commodity prices remained 
somewhat high. After the strengthening of macroeconomic 
regulation and control in mid-1993, the price rises tended 
toward relaxation, but the impact caused by excessive monetary 
issue in the first half of the year still played a delaying 
effect. Therefore, the retail prices still increased by about 
13 percent for the whole year, which lowered somewhat the actual 
living standard of a number of staff and workers. 
  Fourth, the economic performance of enterprises was still 
poor. The economic performance of enterprises was gradually 
improved after the second half of 1991, but a declining trend 
again in 1993. It found expression in the reduction of profits 
realized by enterprises, the expansion of the extent of losses, 
and the decline in the composite indexes of industrial economic 
performance. 
  Fifth, financial difficulties were not essentially overcome. 
The proportion of revenue in the GNP still decreased. 
<H5>  IV. Prospects of Economic Development in 1994 </H5>
  If we make an analysis based on the present situation, there 
are undoubtedly many favorable conditions for speeding up 
economic development in China: 1) The implementation of the 
"Decisions" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Congress and the in-depth study of Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping will inevitably 
promote greatly the growth of the economy. 2) The 
strengthening and improvement in macroeconomic regulation and 
control, and the consolidation of the economic order have 
created favorable macroeconomic environment and microeconomnic 
basis for speeding up economic development. 3) The stock in 
storage is quite abundant. 4) There have been some improvements 
year by year in the conditions of communications and 
transportation and post and telecommunications. 5) With the 
growth of production and improvement in enterprise management, 
the decline in economic performance is taking a favorable turn, 
and it is estimated that there will be some increases in 
enterprise retained profits and state revenue. Moreover, the 
residents' income increases year by year, plus the development 
of banking business and improvement in work, the source of 
credit funds will further expand. All these will become 
important factors for speeding up economic development. 6) The 
international environment is favorable, China's opening to the 
outside world will further expand, the complementarity of 
international exchange is strengthened, and investments in China 
will further increase. Therefore, it is entirely possible to 
achieve a sustained, high-speed, and healthy development of the 
economy. It is an optimum rate to achieve a 9-10 percent GNP 
increase over 1993. 
  However, to achieve a sustained, high-speed, and healthy 
growth, it is still required to do painstaking work: First, 
conscientiously implement various reform measures introduced in 
1994, carry them through to the end, and guard against the 
phenomena of being slack and losing shape. Second, while 
continuing to maintain a basic balance in the total amount of 
social supply and demand, it is necessary to concentrate efforts 
on industrial restructuring, to strengthen agriculture in 
particular, and increase input in agriculture. It is necessary 
to ensure energy, communications, the production of raw and 
processed materials in shortage, the funds for construction, and 
the need for materials, and to continue the policies of limiting 
the production, and allowing the closing down, suspension, and 
bankruptcy of over-supplied products and long-term trades. 
Third, try hard to improve enterprise economic performance. 
  The key is that enterprises should use their "inner skill," 
and change their operational methods of purely relying on 
blindly expanding production and price increases. Moreover, it 
is necessary to strengthen the technological transformation of 
enterprise equipment and the renewal of products, and to rely on 
technological progress to promote performance improvement. 
Fourth, speed up the coordinated development of social 
undertakings and the economy, and give better play to the role 
of science, education, culture, and other social undertakings in 
economic development. Fifth, while speeding up the growth of 
coastal areas, develop more rapidly the economy of the interior 
and outlying areas, and narrow the gap of development between 
regions. Sixth, continue to do a good job in macroeconomic 
regulation and control, and it is especially necessary that we 
should make new progress in strengthening the capacity of 
macroeconomic regulation and control, improving the regulation 
and control system, and giving play to various means of 
regulation and control.

  [Text] Washington, 9 Feb (XINHUA) -- Li Daoyu, Chinese 
ambassador to the United States, said on 9 February that through 
both sides' joint efforts, the Sino-U.S. relationship has 
achieved positive progress [ji ji de jin zhan -- 4480 2817 4104 
6651 1455] in the past year. In particular, the formal meeting 
between President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton in Seattle 
last November has brought about a new and excellent beginning 
[yi ge xin de liang hao kai tuan -- 0001 0020 2450 de 4104 5328 
1170 7030 4551] to the relationship between the two countries, 
which is of important significance to improving and developing 
their bilateral relationship. 
  Li Daoyu made the above remarks this evening in his Spring 
Festival greetings message to Overseas Chinese and Chinese 
Americans in the United States. He added: "It is our hope that 
both sides will seize this turning point [qi ji -- 1148 2623], 
maintain the emerging excellent momentum in the bilateral 
relationship, and proceeding from the overall situation and 
long-term interests and through carrying out a dialogue marked 
by mutual respect and complete equality, further improve and 
develop the bilateral relationship." 
  When touching on the concern of the broad mass of Chinese 
Americans and overseas Chinese for the great cause of the 
peaceful reunification of the motherland, he pointed out that 
achieving the peaceful reunification of the motherland is the 
common aspiration of all the Chinese in China and overseas. 
Creating "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," and "one 
country, two governments" runs counter to historical trends and 
to the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. 
  He continued: "We hope that the Taiwan authorities will 
stress the great cause of the Chinese nation and will, under the 
one-China principle, realize the direct contacts between the two 
sides of the strait as soon as possible, so as to eventually 
pave the way for peaceful reunification." 
  In the same greetings message, Li Daoyu briefed overseas 
Chinese and Chinese Americans on China's achievements in reform, 
opening up, and economic construction last year. He also 
expressed sincere thanks for the valuable contributions that 
overseas Chinese and Chinese Americans have made to China's 
reform, opening up, and economic construction, to the great 
cause of the reunification of the motherland, and to enhancing 
understanding and friendship between the peoples of China and 
the United States.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Officials Optimistic About 1994 U.S. Trade"] </F>
  [Text] Despite possible skirmishes, China is optimistic 
about its trade with the United States this year, according to a 
senior Chinese official. 
  "Sino-US trade volume will see double-digit growth over the 
$27.7 billion in 1993," said Sun Zhenyu, director general of the 
American &amp; Oceanian Affairs Department at the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec). 
  As evidence, Sun pointed to a string of positive signs, 
including the settlement last month of bilateral textile 
disputes. However, he warned against potential one-sided 
pressure from the U.S. 
  Moftec Minister Wu Yi will lead a delegation of Chinese 
Government and business leaders to the US in April to promote 
trade. 
  Apart from attending the eighth session of the Sino-US Joint 
Commission on Commerce and Trade, China will hold two large 
trade conferences in Los Angles and New York, Sun revealed. 
  "Our business delegation will enter into purchase contracts 
with U.S. businesses and invite them to invest in China during 
the conferences ," he said. 
  But Sun declined to disclose which sectors are likely to 
close major deals on imports and investment. 
  In a parallel move, Song Jian, State Councillor and Minister 
of the State Science and Technology Commission, will attend a 
bilateral conference on scientific co-operation in New York. 
  During Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's recent visit to 
China, the U.S. has agreed to provide technical help for China's 
transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented one, 
which Sun described as an indication of improved relations. 
However, Sun urged the U.S. to relax its controls on 
hi-technology exports to help reduce its trade deficit with 
China. 
  "The U.S. competitive edges on the world markets lie in its 
hi-tech items," Sun said. "If their exports to China are 
relaxed, it would be good to both sides." 
  The U.S. claims it had a $23 billion trade deficit with 
China 
in 1993, counting Chinese exports via Hong Kong. But Chinese 
customs put China's surplus at only $6.2 billion. 
  Sun said Minister Wu Yi and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron 
Brown 
had agreed to set up a working group to resolve the difference. 
  "Both sides should enhance mutual understanding and resort 
to 
consultation on an equal footing so that our co-operation can be 
strengthened," he said, adding that any unilateral sanctions 
would be self-defeating. 
  Sun urged better understanding by the U.S. of China's 
situation regarding intellectual property rights protection, 
textile trade and other issues. 
  "And it's unreasonable to link human rights with trade 
issues, such as the extension of the most-favoured-nation (MFN) 
status," he asserted. 
  "We must get rid of the long shadow cast by the MFN issue, 
which has hampered what could have been a quicker development of 
bilateral trade." 
  If settled once and for all, Sun explained, U.S. businesses, 
especially those of medium and small size, could draw up 
long-term strategies towards the Chinese market. 
  "But if the U.S. should revoke MFN for China, it would deal 
a 
blow to the entire course of China's reforms and opening to the 
outside world and cause equal damage to the U.S. investors," he 
said. 
  Sun also urged the U.S. to keep its promise of giving China 
"staunch support" in resuming its membership in the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The U.S. will send a 
delegation to China this month for further negotiations on this 
matter.

  [Text] Washington, February 13 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. 
administration has decided to invoke retaliatory sanctions 
against Japan after a breakdown of the trade talks between the 
two countries, it was reported here today. 
  The "Washington Post" newspaper quoted a senior U.S. 
official 
as saying that the administration was obliged to act firmly 
after the failure Friday by President Bill Clinton and Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to reach agreement on reducing 
Japan's 60 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States. 
  By taking the actions, U.S. officials said, the United 
States 
wants to maintain its negotiating credibility, but no decision 
has been made on which products to target. 
  At the same time, the U.S. administration is seeking to 
persuade the Japanese Government that the trade actions should 
not cause a rupture of the entire relationship. 
  Hosokawa cautioned the United States Saturday against 
imposing trade sanctions on Japan. 
  "I very much hope the U.S. will refrain from such actions," 
Hosokawa told reporters before leaving Washington for home. 
  His top aides warned that such action would cause Japan to 
retaliate with sanctions on American products.

  [Text] Washington, February 11 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States is sending eight F-15E fighter planes to Italy to 
strengthen NATO's force in preparation for threatened air 
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. 
  The planes will reach Italy "within the next few days," the 
Associated Press quoted an anonymous pentagon official as saying. 
  Besides the U.S. offer, France, Britain, Turkey and the 
Netherlands are also contributing more planes so that up to 146 
fighters and bombers could be garnered in the region for the 
Bosnia mission. 
  In a related development, President Bill Clinton talked 
today 
with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin and agreed to work out an 
agreement on the Bosnian crisis. 
  Moscow, opposing the NATO air strike threat, is calling for 
a 
U.N. Security Council conference on the problem, a request 
refused by Washington. 
  Russian officials have threatened that if NATO went ahead 
with air strikes it would the disruption of Moscow's partnership 
with the West on a range of issues. 
  Clinton said during the 30-minute conversation, both sides 
"agreed that we had the same long-term objective, which was 
achieving a just peace agreement, and the same short-term 
objective, to relieve the shelling of Sarajevo." 
  "I think he (Yeltsin) felt better when I emphasized the fact 
that the weapons that are left within the 20-kilometer area 
would be under the jurisdiction of the U.N., not NATO," the 
President said. 
  The two leaders to keep in touch and that the U.S. and 
Russian officials would be having further discussions today at 
the United Nations.

  [Text] Washington, February 12 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. State 
Department has ordered dependents of its embassy officers in 
Belgrade to leave the Yugoslav capital in precaution against

  State Department Spokeswoman Maeve Dwyer said the move was 
taken "because of the ongoing conditions in Bosnia and the 
potential repercussions for travelers." 
  The U.S. Embassy in Belgrade has contacted private U.S. 
citizens in the country and offered to help if they want to 
depart, Dwyer said. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization issued an ultimatum 
Thursday that the Bosnian serbs remove their heavy weapons from 
around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, within 10 days and all 
three sides stop shelling Sarajevo, or risk NATO air strikes. 
  It was feared that possible NATO air strikes may have 
backlashes for foreigners in the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- The 49th annual meeting 
of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific 
has decided that the ministerial meeting to promote and develop 
the utilization of outer space for the Asia-Pacific region will 
be held in Beijing in September 1994. 
  As the host country responsible for organizing this meeting, 
China has established a preparatory committee with the 
participation of leaders from 16 ministries and commissions, 
including the State Science and Technology Commission, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences. Qian Qichen, vice premier of the 
State Council and foreign minister, and Song Jian, state 
councillor and minister in charge of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, have been appointed honorary chairmen of 
the preparatory committee. 
  It has been learned that following the multipolarization of 
the world economy and the realignment and regrouping of regions, 
the economy in the Asia-Pacific region has been booming and very 
active. It has become an urgest task to apply space technology 
to solve major problems such as the shortage of resources, the 
deterioration of the environment, frequent occurrences of 
natural disasters, and the rapid increase of population 
confronting the region. Through the strategy and action program 
to promote and develop outer space utilization in the 
Asia-Pacific region, the meeting will determine a mechanism for 
coordination and cooperation in promoting and developing outer 
space utilization in the region. It will also issue the Beijing 
declaration and other documents. The topics to be discussed at 
the meeting include remote sensing, communications satellites, 
application of satellites for meteorology, system for space 
positioning, geographical information system, and space 
technology.

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Zhifang (0719 1807 2455) and Deng Ying </F>
(6772 4481)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Feb (XINHUA) -- According to a briefing 
by the National Nuclear Safety Administration [NNSA], in recent 
years, China has participated in international nuclear safety 
cooperation and exchanges and has actively offered to hold 
safety talks with developing countries on the peaceful 
utilization of nuclear energy. 
  Nuclear safety is a decisive factor affecting the prospects 
for the development of the peaceful utilization of nuclear 
energy, and it has become an important matter followed with 
interest by every country in the world. It has been learned 
that in recent years, China successively entered into agreements 
on bilateral nuclear safety cooperation with the United States, 
France, Italy, Spain, Pakistan, and Germany, and that it 
established friendly cooperation and carried out extensive 
exchanges of nuclear-safety technology with some countries, 
including Japan and Russia. More than once, the NNSA has sent 
relevant personnel abroad to receive technical training in 
nuclear safety laws and regulations, the safety supervision and 
inspection of nuclear power stations, the analysis of nuclear 
accidents, the use of nuclear power plant simulators, and in 
quality guarantees. According to statistics, so far a total of 
scores of nuclear safety experts have received standardized 
international training. In addition, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], the UN Development Program, and the EC 
have provided experts and funds to help China hold training 
sessions for nuclear safety supervision and control. More than 
once, Chinese nuclear safety officials have participated in 
various IAEA-sponsored conferences. 
  In basing itself on its actual conditions, China has used 
advanced foreign technologies and management experiences for 
reference, has further improved its nuclear-safety control 
system, and has kept raising the overall level of its nuclear 
safety work through cooperation and exchanges. China has begun 
providing to developing countries some safety technologies 
related to the development of nuclear power as well as 
experience in supervision and control. China is giving play to 
its due role in international nuclear safety cooperation and 
exchanges.

  [Text] Geneva, February 11 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese delegate 
said here today that the Chinese Government always pays great 
attention to the minority nationalities issue and has introduced 
a series of related laws which suit its national conditions. 
  Choegyal, member of the Chinese delegation to the 50th 
session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, said that 
the Chinese Government regards the equality and solidarity of 
all nationalities and the practising of regional national 
autonomy as basic principles in dealing with minority 
nationalities issue. 
  He briefed the participants on China's minority 
nationalities 
policy, saying, "the adherence to the equality of all 
nationalities is a basic principle stipulateed in China's 
Constitution." 
  "In China, all nationalities, irrespective of their 
differences in population size, level of social and economic 
development, customs and practices, religious beliefs and 
languages, enjoy equal status and equal rights," he said. 
  As China is a country with 56 nationalities, he said, the 
Chinese Government always pays great attention to the 
strengthening of solidarity and harmony among them. 
  "The government has always been careful with the protection 
of the rights and the interests of minority nationalities," he 
said. "In dealing with such issues, the views of the 
nationalities concerned are extensively solicited and full 
consultations conducted." 
  "The government also adopts laws as well as concrete 
measures 
in order to guarantee participation by minority nationalities in 
the management of state and local affairs in various aspects of 
social life," he added. 
  In addition, as certain gaps still exist in economic and 
social development between areas inhabited by minority 
nationalities and those inhabited by the Han nationality due to 
historical, natural and geographical factors, "the Chinese 
Government has always emphasized the importance of providing 
necessary financial, human and material assistance to them," he 
said. 
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Government always grants them 
preferential policies in formulating programs for national 
economic development. It also requires and encourages the 
better-developed areas to help them, he added. 
  The Chinese delegate also stressed that regional national 
autonomy is an important aspect of the political system provided 
by the Constitution. 
  "The system has played an important role in protecting the 
rights of the minority nationalities and in promoting the 
development of these areas," he said. 
  The Chinese delegate pointed out that China's minority 
nationalities policy has proved to be successful in the past 40 
years.

  [Text] Athens, February 10 (XINHUA) -- Greek Premier 
Andreas Papandreou today said that the U.S. decision to 
recognize Macedonia would have "certain repercussions" on 
relations between his country and the United States. 
  The United States Wednesday [9 February] formally recognized 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, saying it would 
establish full diplomatic relations with the republic once it 
pledged to try to resolve its differences with Greece. 
  "We would like to believe that the text of the decision 
granting recognition might be used positively, but right now we 
don't know whether it will," Papandreou told reporters after a 
cabinet meeting. 
  The recognition would encourage Macedonian President Kiro 
Gligorov, who was "out of touch with reality," Papandreou said. 
  He said the reality was that Greece could isolate Macedonia 
economically. 
  The premier added that the U.S. recognition of Macedonia did 
not contribute to "normality." 
  "In contrast," he said, "exerting pressure (on Skopje) for 
it 
to abandon its liberating designs would contribute." 
  Replying to questions, Papandreou said that it was possible 
to hold a meeting of Greece's political party leaders on the 
Macedonian issue, to be chaired by President Konstandinos 
Karamanlis. 
  Papandreou said that he was optimistic regarding the issue, 
adding that its solution required "patience, persistence and 
determination." 
  He had recently developed a good personal relationship with 
U.S. President Bill Clinton, the premier said. 
  However, he said, countries did not act on the basis of 
personal friendship or party identities; they acted on the basis 
of strategic interests as they saw them.

  [Text] Washington, February 10 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States may reduce anti-drug aid to Peru, Panama, Bolivia and 
other countries that produce or traffic in illegal drugs, 
official U.S. sources said here today. 
  These countries have escaped penalties because of friendly 
relations with the United States, said a government official who 
declined to be identified. 
  These countries are on a list of nations that failed to 
convince the U.S. that they have cooperated with the U.S. 
efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs, and, consequently, 
failed to receive U.S. certification last year, which is a 
condition of receiving U.S. anti-drug aid, the official said. 
  Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard told reporters 
Wednesday [9 February] that the administration also was 
considering countries that may not receive the certification on 
the annual April 1 deadline. 
  Gelbard said this when he briefed reporters on the 
international component of President Clinton's new 13.2 billion 
dollars national drug control strategy, which places greater 
emphasis on domestic treatment and prevention rather than 
international intervention. 
  Drug producing and trafficking countries that do not make an 
effort will face increasingly serious economic and other 
sanctions, according to Clinton's plan. 
  Clinton's new budget proposes increasing money for the State 
Department's anti-drug efforts by 80 million dollars to 252 
million dollars. 
  To underscore the U.S. emphasis on cooperation, Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher on Wednesday told several dozen 
ambassadors from drug production and transit countries and a 
number of other European and Latin American countries that 
cocaine and heroin are not just American problems, saying that 
drugs are a global menace....[ellipses as received] The grip 
drug dealers have on many governments is just terrifying. 
  The United States in recent years has focused attention on 
curtailing coca leaf production and cocaine trafficking in Latin 
America, but Gelbard and other officials also cited the 
burgeoning heroin trafficking that followed the breakup of the 
Soviet Union.

  [Text] Moscow, February 12 (XINHUA) -- The possibility for 
a political solution to the Bosnian war still exists, Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today. 
  Speaking at a news conference, Kozyrev said that Russia is 
taking a vigilant attitude toward the position of aid-raiding 
Bosnia-Herzegovina because such a policy would distract the 
international efforts for a political solution. 
  The minister stressed that NATO's action should be brought 
into U.N. peacekeeping plan. 
  According to Kozyrev, U.N. Security Council will hold a 
meeting on Monday [14 February] to determine NATO's tasks and 
duties in Bosnia. 
  NATO's ultimatum to Bosnian warring factions should be 
approved as a resolution of the Security Council which will 
allow some countries or regional organizations to have a hand in 
ending the Bosnian war, the minister added.

  [Text] Kozyrev, foreign affairs minister of the Russian 
Federation, arrived in Heihe about 1300 on 26 January for a 
short visit. On behalf of Shao Qihui, governor of the 
Heilongjiang Provincial government, Vice Governor Wang Zongzhang 
met with Minister Kozyrev and also held a 50-minute talk with 
him. 
  Vice Governor Wang Zongzhang first explained the ways in 
which Heilongjiang Province and the Russian Federation are 
making ceaseless efforts to develop border economic and trade 
cooperation. He then set forth some existing problems cropping 
up during mutual contacts. Vice Governor Wang suggested: 
First, i addition to giving visas to those with official or 
ordinary passports, the Russian Federation should give entry 
visas to our side's tallymen, drivers, persons from large 
economic and trade enterprises, interpreters, and laborers who 
have to traverse the Russian Federation border often. Second, 
nongovernmental economic and trade committees should be set up 
to solve the problems cropping up during mutual economic and 
trade activities. Third, a formal agreement on building the 
Heilongjiang highway bridge linking Heihe with Blagoveshchensk 
city should be reached as soon as possible. Fourth, we hope the 
Russian Government will support the cooperative construction of 
the "Heihe- Blagoveshchensk free economic and trade zone." 
Fifth, it is necessary to pioneer the construction of the 
Suifenhe and Pogranichnyy border area of Maritime Kray. Sixth, 
in addition Suifenhe, which has been opened as an international 
passenger-cargo port, we suggest the establishment of other 
international passenger-cargo ports and their opening to other 
countries. Seventh, we hope that the Russian Federation will 
provide conveniences for the other CIS countries that have to 
deliver their goods to our country through the Russian 
Federation. Eighth, we hope that the Russian Government will 
provide preferential policies on developing border trade to 
promote friendly contacts and border trade cooperation.

  [Text] Moscow, February 10 (XINHUA) -- Russia today called 
for a United Nations Security Council session to discuss 
demilitarization of Bosnian capital Sarajevo and putting the 
city under U.N. administration. 
  Gregoriy Karasin, director of the Press Bureau of the 
Russian 
Foreign Ministry, said at a press conference today that all 
countries having interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be 
invited to attend such a meeting with the council's members. 
  He said Russia appreciates the call by NATO countries for 
the 
withdrawal of heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo by all warring 
sides in Bosnia, or putting them under U.N. control. 
  He said the withdrawal of the weaponry could be an important 
step towards peace. 
  But Russia also objects to explaining the NATO call, made 
yesterday in Brussels, as an air strike ultimatum that goes to 
the Serbs only. He said this is an very partial explanation. 
  He said Russia always considers it a job for the U.N. to 
solve the problem of the siege of Sarajevo, and does not want to 
see any one side in the Bosnian conflict to have "privileges" in 
the demilitarization process of the Bosnian capital. 
  The NATO issued a call to the Bosnian Serbs yesterday, 
asking 
them to remove their artillery from hills overlooking Sarajevo 
within 10 days, or face NATO air strikes. 
  The NATO decision was made after 68 civilians were killed 
and 
200 wounded in a mortar shell explosion last Saturday [5 
February] in a downtown Sarajevo marketplace. 
  It is not determined yet who made the mortar attack. 
  The Russian official also warned that any "hasty decision 
made outside the framework of the U.N." could wipe out any hope 
that could emerge from the Bosnian peace talks. 
  The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin also 
said today that the hopes to solve the Bosnian conflict now lies 
in the demilitarization of Sarajevo and U.N. administration of 
the city, which has been under Serbian siege for 22 months.

  [Text] Almaty, February 12 (XINHUA) -- Kazakhstan has sent 
to Russia 12 of its SS-18 inter-continental ballistic missiles 
(ICBM) left there by the former Soviet Union, Kazak state 
advisor Tulegen Zhukeyev [spelling of name as received] said 
here today. 
  Under the Lisbon Protocol signed in May 1992, all the 
nuclear 
weapons in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan should be transferred 
to Russia for destruction within seven years. 
  Explaining why Kazakhstan had been going at a slow pace of 
12 
missiles a year, Zhukeyev told journalists that some of its 
material requests have not been met. 
  He said that Kazakhstan should own the uranium contained in 
its nuclear warheads because Kazakhstan accounted for 50 percent 
of the uranium produced by the former Soviet Union. 
  He added that as the nuclear test site of Semipalatinsk 
[spelling of name as received] in Kazakhstan has caused harm to 
more than one million residents in the surrounding areas, 
Kazakhstan has the right to demand material compensation. 
  However, he told the press that his country remains 
committed 
to the Lisbon protocol. 
  He also denied a recent allegation of the Russian newspaper 
IZVESTIYA that the nuclear weapons in his country are "on the 
verge of accidents". 
  A total of 104 SS-18 ICBM are deployed on the soil of 
Kazakhstan. The fuels of these missiles will be burnt in 
high-temperatured closed furnaces in Kazakhstan, for which the 
United States will provide technical aid and 75 million U.S. 
dollars, official sources said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 12 (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said here today 
that his country did not change its position on settling the 
nuclear issue through dialogue and called on the United States 
to stop putting pressure on DPRK. 
  The spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry said since the 
U.S. had violated the agreement between the two countries, DPRK 
will not put much hope on its dialogue with the U.S. and will 
not bind by its previous promises. 
  He said the U.S. has recently told the DPRK that the nuclear 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
should be carried out with the sole aim of ensuring the 
continuity of the nuclear safety agreement and that the U.S. is 
willing to continue the talks between the two countries. 
  At the same time, the IAEA has also indicated that they 
would 
give up the demand for a comprehensive inspection and will only 
conduct those necessary for ensuring the continuity of the 
nuclear safety agreement, the spokesman said. 
  If these attitudes of the U.S. and IAEA are true, it will be 
a matter for rejoicing, the spokesman said.

  [Text] Washington, February 12 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said here today that he hoped the 
United States would not take retaliatory trade sanctions against 
Japan. 
  Hosokawa indicated that Japan would view such moves as 
violations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
but said he was not frightened of possible retaliatory strikes. 
  "I very much hope the U.S. will refrain from such action," 
the prime minister said at a news conference before his 
departure for Tokyo. 
  Hosokawa, who arrived here Thursday [10 February] night for 
a 
two-day visit, held the first summit meeting with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton Friday, but failed to reach a trade agreement. 
  Clinton criticized Japan for unwilling to open its market to 
U.S. goods. "It is better to have reached no agreement than to 
reach an empty agreement," Clinton said. 
  Clinton invited Hosokawa and his wife to breakfast at the 
White House today to demonstrate that failure of trade talks 
would not affect the friendly relationship between the U.S. and 
Japan. 
  Afterward, the President told reporters that no further 
trade 
discussions were conducted at the breakfast meeting and that "it 
was a totally social visit." 
  But he said that "we just have to examine what our next 
steps 
will be, and we will be turning to that next week." 
  Hosokawa didn't think the failure of the agreement will lead 
immediately to U.S. trade sanctions against his country. 
  The prime minister said Japan would not drop its resistance 
to "numerical targets" which the United States has demanded, 
aiming at cutting Japan's giant trade surplus. 
  Hosokawa insisted that "we will not modify our position in 
that regard," although the Japanese leader will be returning 
empty-handed from the U.S. summit meeting.

  [Text] Sanaa, February 12 (XINHUA) -- Three Yemeni gunmen 
kidnapped at noon today three Chinese experts working on a road 
construction project. 
  The three Chinese, the head of a Chinese technical team 
executing the Jahaffa-Maareb Road Construction Project, the 
chief engineer and the assistant manager of the project, were 
kidnapped 47 kilometers away from the city of Jahaffa. 
  XINHUA correspondent learned from a reliable source that the 
three Yemeni kidnappers have made two conditions for freeing 
their hostages, namely, completely halting work on the project 
and withdrawing all those who are engaged in the project. 
  Yemeni competent authorities have hastened to take measures 
aimed at getting the Chinese hostages released. 
  The security situation in Yemen has been deteriorating in 
the 
recent years, and there has been recurrent abductions of 
accredited foreign diplomats, foreign tourists and employees of 
foreign companies operating in Yemen. 
  As far as the aforesaid Chinese technical team is concerned, 
today's incident is the third time that its members were 
kidnapped since 1991.

<F P=106> [By "Post Correspondent" David Wallen in London] </F>
  [Text] The European Parliament has issued a ringing 
condemnation of China's human rights abuses, urging guarantees 
for the liberties of Hong Kong and calling on the European Union 
(EU) not to improve links with Beijing until there is an 
improvement. It will be forwarded to Beijing and the 
governments of European member states over the next few days and 
could be used to block future trade agreements between the EU 
and China. 
  The 33-item resolution, passed without opposition, condemns 
labour camps, and calls for the release of political prisoners, 
the ending of the sale in Europe of goods produced by forced 
labour and the establishment of a multi-party state. It also 
regrets visits by senior Western politicians such as Chancellor 
Dr. Helmut Kohl and Prime Minister John Major. 
  Although the motion is mainly advisory and has no 
legislative 
weight, it could turn into a considerable embarrassment to EU 
governments, including Britain, anxious to step up political and 
trade links. 
  "It is a reminder to ministers of the concern of Europe's 
elected politicians about human rights issues and they should 
not forget that," said a parliament spokesman in Strasbourg 
yesterday. "It is a warning to them that they should not 
negotiate trade agreements without thinking of these issues." 
  He warned that the Parliament had blocked trade agreements 
with countries including Morocco and Syria in the past because 
of concern over human rights and had the power to do so with 
China. 
  Although the Parliament has a say on trade deals the real 
power within the EU is still the European Council -- its 
executive wing comprised of government ministers. But 
politicians and groups around the world opposed to Chinese human 
rights abuses will be able to turn to the motion as the first 
pan-European democratic view on how links with China should be 
viewed. 
  Foreign policy within the EU remains the province of the 
Council and of national governments although under the 
Maastricht Treaty the Parliament's influence is growing. 
  The resolution says economic reforms should be accompanied 
by 
"the gradual introduction of internationally recognised social 
standards" and reminds China that it is a signatory to the 
Universal Declaration on Human Rights. It "reaffirms its 
condemnation of the use of the death penalty and torture" and 
"calls on the Chinese Government to release all persons whose 
only crime is practising their religion". 
  It goes on to express "the hope that the Chinese legal 
system 
can become genuinely independent of the political authorities 
and able to guarantee citizens the right to legal counsel and to 
a fair trial". It condemns the "physical and moral pressure 
exerted on women to have abortions and the widespread practice 
of infanticide, especially of baby girls". 
  The resolution expresses concern about conditions in Chinese 
prisons where it claims prisoners suffer through isolation and 
inadequate medical care. 
  Most of the resolution is extremely condemnatory. 
  It goes on to express regret about the way the lack of human 
rights and democracy in China makes it necessary to maintain 
restrictions on the number of official visits. It says that any 
"further expansion of co-operation" between China and the EU 
should be accompanied by the ending of the system of "lao gai" 
or labour camps and the freeing of political prisoners along 
with respect for "the human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
the people of Tibet. This should be accompanied by the opening 
of negotiations with the Dalai Lama." 
  But it is not all negative. While condemning some official 
visits, it supports professional and academic exchanges and 
approves technical and financial schemes. It also welcomes the 
normalization of relations between China and Vietnam, Russia, 
India and other countries in the region. 
  It calls on China to put pressure on North Korea over its 
nuclear programme, yet condemns arms sales and nuclear testing. 
  The motion is the result of the first report to be drawn up 
on EU-Chinese relations since the Tiananmen Square massacre and 
is accompanied by a lengthy appraisal of events within the 
country, its economy and the party hierarchy. It has not 
concentrated on Hong Kong to any extent although it stresses 
that links with China must include "securing agreement that the 
human rights of the people of Hong Kong and Macao are respected 
after these territories return to Chinese sovereignty". 
  The Parliament says it "hopes that the planned reunification 
with Hong Kong and Macao in line with the principle `one 
country, two systems' will be accompanied by every possible 
democratic guarantee". 
  The resolution was drawn up by the Parliament's Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and Security under the guidance of an Italian 
Green MEP Maria Aglietta.

  [Text] Paris, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- Chinese Ambassador to 
France Cai Fangbo gave a banquet on the evening of 2 February to 
mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between China and France. Pierre Mehaignerie, justice 
and keeper of the Seal of France; his wife; noted figures of 
France's political, industrial, and commercial circles; and 
high-ranking government officials numbering more than 50 
attended. 
  In a warm and friendly atmosphere, Cai Fangbo and 
Mehaignerie 
proposed their toasts, respectively. Both sides agreed that the 
historic decision, made with the foresight and sagacity of a 
great politican 30 years ago by Chairman Mao and General de 
Gaulle, to establish diplomatic relations between China and 
France had not only laid the foundation for developing sincere 
friendship between the two countries, but also had had a 
far-reaching impact on international affairs. 
  After recalling the exchange of visits by leaders of the two 
countries and the course traversed by the friendly and 
cooperative relations between the two countries in the past 30 
years since the establishment of diplomatic regions, Cai Fangbo 
pointed out: After undergoing a period of difficulties and 
setbacks, China and France issued a joint communique on the 
improvement of relations, thus opening a new page in bilateral 
relations. He said: Both China and France, as permanent 
members of the Security Council, bear great responsibilities for 
international affairs. Moreover, they share many identical or 
similar views in many international issues. Both sides should 
strengthen consultation and coordination. He said: "The 
maintenance of stable relationship of friendship and cooperation 
between China and France on a long-term basis not only conforms 
to the fundamental interests of the two countries, but is an 
important factor for maintaining balance and stability in the 
world." 
  In his toast, Mehaignerie warmly lauded China's reform and 
open policy and its vigorously growing economy. He also noted 
that "France hopes to contribute to China's success in reform." 
He noted: France and China should develop bilateral economic 
cooperation, particularly cooperation in energy, transportation, 
and telecommunications. French enterprises are ready to become 
China's cooperation partners. He expressed the conviction that 
the upcoming visit of French Premier Balladur to China will 
certainly bring new and greater development of French-Chinese 
relations. 
  Also attending the banquet were former French Premier 
Delmas; 
the wife of former French President Pompidou; (Peilefti) and 
(Altsoke), government ministers of De Gaulle's era; Admiral 
Philip de Gaulle, son of De Gaulle; and several former French 
ambassadors to China.

<F P=106> [From David Healy in London] </F>
  [Text] China has launched a fresh attack on Britain with a 
tough new warning designed to dispel any doubts it will 
dismantle all Hong Kong's political structures in 1997. The 
message came in a last-minute letter from China's London 
ambassador, Ma Yuzhen, to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs 
Committee (FAC), just as they finished taking evidence last week 
in their high-profile inquiry into Sino-British relations. 
Senior committee members said the letter was "political 
dynamite" and "a bombshell". 
  Mr. Ma accuses Governor Chris Patten and other senior 
British 
officials of being "irresponsible and grossly misleading to the 
British public and the people in Hong Kong" for saying Beijing 
may not carry out its threats "for fear of international 
pressure." He also claimed China made major concessions during 
the 17 rounds of political reform talks in Beijing and agreement 
was "almost in sight" when Britain unilaterally terminated the 
negotiations. 
  Mr. Ma's letter is seen as a last-ditch attempt to influence 
the committee's impending report, following revelations that the 
all-party group intends to back Mr. Patten and his proposals to 
widen the territory's democratic base. The ambassador has been 
waging a behind-the-scenes campaign to undermine support for Mr. 
Patten in London. 
  News of the letter came as China's Vice-President, Rong 
Yiren, was yesterday reported to have reiterated that Beijing 
will stand by its agreements with Britain over Hong Kong's 
future. XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) quoted Mr. Rong as 
saying whatever happens, China will adhere to the principles of 
"one country, two systems" and "letting the people in Hong Kong 
administer Hong Kong". 
  Mr. Ma says in his letter to FAC chairman David Howell he 
"felt a need" for a fuller explanation on Chinese efforts to 
resolve differences over Hong Kong, adding he welcomed further 
opportunities to discuss them and other questions of common 
interest. He also demolished suggestions by the Governor and 
others that Beijing will not necessarily dismantle the 
Legislative Council, Urban and Regional Councils and District 
Boards in 1997. 
  "May I say that they [British officials] are grossly 
mistaken 
if they really think so," Mr. Ma says. "In the absence of an 
agreement between China and Britain, China will definitely 
disband and re-establish Hong Kong's three tier councils on July 
1, 1997. 
  "Politically, China will resume the exercise of sovereignty 
over Hong Kong and Britain's executive power will terminate on 
June 30, 1997, together with the end of British-Hong Kong 
authorities' institutions. 
  "As a matter of course, China will re-establish Hong Kong's 
three tier councils in accordance with the provisions of the 
Basic Law. To say otherwise and dismiss China's justified action 
as something impossible is irresponsible and misleading to the 
British public and the people in Hong Kong." 
  Mr. Ma also accuses Mr. Patten of violating the Joint 
Declaration with his call for "fair, open and acceptable" 
elections. 
  "Another oft-repeated view consists in working for an 
`arrangement for a fair and credible election in Hong Kong'," 
the letter says. 
  "According to the proponents of this theory, this is what 
the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration is all about. This is a travesty 
of the spirit of this important document. The central theme of 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration is the resumption of and the 
exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong and the handover 
of Hong Kong by Britain to China on July 1, 1997, as well as the 
implementation of the concept of one country, two systems. 
  "It is totally different from the transfer of political 
power 
from one political party to the other in Britain. The 
implementation of the concept of one country, two systems, 
including the holding of elections, will take place according to 
the basic law under China's sovereignty. This can in no way be 
confused with what Britain is doing in haste without prior 
agreement with China." 
  Mr. Ma concludes by claiming China made major compromises in 
an effort to reach agreement during last year's political reform 
talks in Beijing. "Contrary to the assertion that China only 
made one concession during 17 rounds of talks, China actually 
made great efforts on three questions," he says. 
  "Firstly, the Chinese side agreed to lower the voting age; 
secondly, it accepted the British proposal for using the single 
set, single vote method in the elections of the district boards 
and the two municipal councils; thirdly, although the Chinese 
side held different views on the abolition of appointed seats in 
the local organisations, it went on to propose a solution to 
accommodate the British position, i.e., Britain may go ahead 
with abolishing the appointed seats in the 1994-95 elections 
while after 1997 necessary adjustments may be made by the 
government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the 
light of relevant provisions of the Basic Law." 
  Mr. Ma attempts to lay the blame for the breakdown of the 
talks firmly on the British. "We were completely puzzled why 
the British side, while talking about time constraints, blocked 
the reaching of an agreement which was almost in sight, and let 
that opportunity slip by," he says. "That things should come to 
such a pass is not the making of the Chinese side."

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Says Names of the First Group of </F>
District Affairs Advisers To Be Announced Soon"] 
  [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA News 
Agency Hong Kong Branch, pointed out yesterday at an annual 
dinner hosted by the Bo-Yuen (Taos) Machinery Maker Company 
Limited that the problem of the new airport remains unsolved to 
this day because the financial arrangements of the Hong Kong 
Government exceed the provisions of the Airport Memorandum of 
Understanding [MOU]. He also revealed that the name list of the 
first group of district advisers will soon be announced. 
  Zhang Junsheng gave his New Year's greetings to Hong Kong 
citizens through the news media, wishing them luck in the new 
year and Hong Kong better economic growth than last year through 
its own efforts, as well as continued prosperity and stability. 
  At the dinner party, Zhang Junsheng said in reply to a 
reporter's question: We have just received the Hong Kong 
Government's fourth financial package. We will formally 
announce our view on it after detailed study. Zhang pointed out 
that the airport problem should have been tackled strictly 
according to the MOU, and that the concerned party should have 
fulfilled what it was supposed to fulfill. However, because the 
airport financial package of the British Hong Kong Government 
exceeds the provisions of the MOU, to this day there has been no 
agreement on it between China and Britain. 
  On Sino-British relations, Zhang pointed out that it is not 
up to China to decide the state of Sino-British relations. We 
hoped for very good cooperation on the problem of Hong Kong, but 
the state of cooperation has been damaged, the cause of which 
does not lie with us, but with Britain. 
  Asked about the safety of the Daya Bay nuclear power 
station, 
Zhang said: Even during the construction, the power plant 
strictly observed the relevant provisions of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. All safety standards and contingency 
plans are in strict accordance with international standards.

  [Text] Zhou Nan, director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch said 
yesterday that the Chinese side will announce in March the 
namelist of additional members of the Preliminary Working 
Committee (PWC) for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region. However, he refused to disclose 
any details saying it is still too early to do so. 
  At an interview by cable television on a train from Conghua 
to Hong Kong yesterday, Zhou Nan disclosed that the Chinese side 
will further increase the membership of the PWC. Zhou Nan 
refused to disclose the names and number of the candidates and 
said that it is still a little too early to do so and that the 
public will know about them in March. 
  In addition, Zhou Nan also mentioned that there is only one 
solution to the new airport issue, and that is the Hong Kong 
Government should meet the requirements stated in the airport 
memorandum of understanding, should leave behind 25 billion to 
the Government of the Special Administrative Region in 1997, and 
should not cause the Government of the Special Administrative 
Region to have a debt exceeding 5 billion. 
  Zhou Nan also mentioned the public speeches made by CPC 
senior statesman Deng Xiaoping and State Council Premier Li Peng 
during the Spring Festival and said that they show China has 
resolutely followed the line of deepening opening up and reform.

  [Text] Guo Fengmin, the Joint Liaison Group's [JLG] 
Chinese team leader, last night gave the first official 
indication that China wanted to re-open talks on the financing 
of the new airport. Guo said China had studied Britain's latest 
funding proposals and would seek a meeting with the British side 
after the lunar new year. "A meeting of the (JLG's) Airport 
Committee is inevitable," he said. 
  "After the new year, I suppose the experts on the two sides 
can meet and exchange views to pave the way and set the 
conditions for a meeting of the Airport Committee." He said 
China would contact British representatives to arrange the date 
and details of the meeting. 
  This was the first time Beijing had officially responded to 
Britain's fourth and latest package, which proposes pumping more 
than $60bn into the Provisional Airport Authority and Mass 
Transit Railway Corporation to finance the airport and railway 
projects. Britain's earlier proposal which was rejected by China 
involved injecting only $45bn. Beijing has yet to make an 
formal counter- proposal to meet its aim of lowering debts and 
increasing government equity. 
  Guo would not give Beijing's view of the British proposal, 
but said an in-depth study was continuing. 
  Meanwhile, Zhou Nan, the Hong Kong chief of the NEW CHINA 
NEWS AGENCY (XINHUA), last night reiterated the importance of 
sticking to the Memorandum of Understanding on the new airport.

<F P=106> [By political editor Danny Gittings and Polly Choy] </F>
  [Text] Talks on funding for Hong Kong's new airport could 
begin as early as this week after the Government yesterday 
welcomed China's offer to reopen discussions on the issue. A 
Government spokesman said Hong Kong would accept Chinese Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG) team leader Guo Fengmin's offer of expert 
discussions to pave the way for a full meeting of the JLG's 
airport committee. 
  Britain has been pushing for such talks -- to resolve 
differences over land issues -- for several months. It also 
wants the airport committee to meet to discuss a new funding 
package for the project. Deputy British JLG team leader Alan 
Paul is expected to discuss the offer with his Chinese 
counterpart Hu Houcheng later this week. 
  Mr. Guo said on Friday an airport committee session was now 
"inevitable" and that experts from both sides should "meet and 
exchange views to pave the way" for it. His comments 
constituted China's first official confirmation it wants to 
discuss the Government's recent fourth financial package for the 
Chek Lap Kok project and rail link, which proposes pumping more 
than $60 billion of public funding into the two schemes. 
  "We agree with Mr. Guo's statement that a meeting of the 
airport committee should take place and we hope that this can be 
arranged as soon as possible to resolve outstanding issues on 
airport and airport railway funding," a Government spokesman 
said yesterday. "In the meantime we are, of course, willing to 
hold expert talks to help pave the way for what we hope will be 
an early agreement." 
  Legislator and Airport Consultative Committee (ACC) members 
welcomed the news and hoped both sides could reach a 
comprehensive agreement on financial issues. "This is a good 
news," said ACC member Ho King-on. "The expert meeting may be 
able to narrow the differences between two sides." 
  United Democrats legislator Chan Wai-yip also welcomed the 
possible resumption of talks, even though he expressed concern 
that the latest financial package might tax the Hong Kong 
Government's reserves. He said the Government needed to revise 
its estimates for revenue from 62 hectares of airport land 
sales, saying these should have been higher. He added that the 
amount should be enough to pay government equity and thereby 
eliminate the need to draw money from the reserve. But the 
legislator argued these issues would not seriously inhibit the 
talks, referring to them as "technical problems" only. 
  Another ACC member, Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, urged both 
sides to treasure the new co-operative atmosphere. "If the 
British and Chinese really want to negotiate, they should make 
the best use of this opportunity before another major political 
dispute rises again in March -- when the Governor tables the 
second part of his political package in the Legislative 
Council," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, 9 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Lu Ping, 
director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, wishes Hong Kong and Macao compatriots a happy new year 
on behalf of his office in a signed article carried here by 
today's RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION. 
  Lu Ping says: The Chinese observe a very good tradition: 
They always greet and give each other best wishes during the 
spring festival. On the eve of this festive occasion, on behalf 
of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs, I would like 
to say Happy New Year to all Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, 
and may the new year bring joy and good fortune to you and your 
families, and may everything come your way. 
  Lu Ping says: In the past year, to ensure a smooth 
transition in 1997 for Hong Kong and to ensure its economic 
prosperity, the Chinese Government showed deep sincerity in 
important issues such as the Sino-British talks on the 1994-95 
electoral arrangements and the financial arrangements for Hong 
Kong's new airport, making enormous efforts to solve the 
problems. Our objective was to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity 
and stability through cooperation with Britain. Regrettably, 
Britain disregarded the Chinese Government's sincerity, the 
wishes of the Hong Kong compatriots, and Hong Kong's need for a 
stable transition, by flagrantly and unilaterally halting the 
negotiations, adopting a confrontational attitude toward China, 
and creating obstacles to a smooth transition for Hong Kong, 
thereby indicating the colonialists' reluctance to retreat from 
the historical arena in peace. 
  Lu Ping says: To abide by the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, safeguard the long-term interests of Hong Kong 
society, and ensure that the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [SAR] will be implemented after 1 July 
1997, the Chinese Government in 1993 increased the pace of 
preparations for restoring China's sovereignty over Hong Kong, 
set up a Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory 
Committee for the Hong Kong SAR under the National People's 
Congress, marshaled all forces from different quarters in Hong 
Kong, and mobilized every positive factor, in a joint effort to 
safeguard a smooth transition for Hong Kong. On the economic 
front, meanwhile, deepening reforms on the mainland enabled Hong 
Kong to escape the impact of economic recession in the West and 
to continue its strong momentum of growth. There was 
considerable growth in Hong Kong's economy, finance, trade, and 
shipping in 1993. The Hong Kong and mainland economies promoted 
and supplemented each other. The development of the mainland's 
economy will be increasingly critical for Hong Kong's 
prosperity. Hong Kong compatriots can be assured that whatever 
happens, we will stand together through thick and thin, and will 
be united in mind and heart with Hong Kong in upholding the 
policy of "one country, two systems," implementing the Basic 
Law, and achieving a smooth transition in Hong Kong. 
  Lu Ping said that the deliberation, adoption, and 
promulgation in 1993 of the Basic Law of the Macao Special 
Administrative Region by the National People's Congress provides 
a fundamental guarantee for Macao's smooth transition and 
political handover, and for long-term stability and development 
after 1999. To implement the Sino- Portuguese Joint Declaration 
and ensure Macao's smooth transition, China and Portugal will 
continue friendly cooperation. In 1993, through the joint 
efforts of people from various quarters, Macao enjoyed social 
stability, as well as sustained and steady economic development. 
Its large-scale projects, such as the international airport, 
progressed well. Of course, work on Macao's transition still 
requires further cooperation between China and Portugal. The 
pace of work must be increased. Macao's economy also needs to 
adopt appropriate measures to solve the problem of industrial 
transformation and to promote growth. We believe that as long 
as China and Portugal continue to strengthen friendly 
cooperation on the basis of the Sino-Portuguese Joint 
Declaration, and as long as people of all quarters are further 
united in mind and action, there certainly will be a better 
tomorrow for Macao!

<F P=106> [By Quinton Chan and Danny Gittings] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong will have its first human rights "court" 
and commission if a radical new bill proposed by independent 
legislator Anna Wu Hung-yuk becomes law. The new bodies would 
have sweeping powers to enable them to investigate rights abuses 
and penalise the perpetrators, according to a draft copy of the 
bill obtained by the Sunday Morning Post. 
  The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Bill, to be 
forwarded to the Government tomorrow, also proposes major 
changes to the territory's legal system and includes a proposal 
for a tribunal to deal with human rights disputes. Under the 
private member's bill, a human rights and equal opportunities 
commission would be set up to examine whether existing laws were 
in line with the Bill of Rights. It would also investigate 
complaints, advise the Government on Bill of Rights issues and 
international human rights conventions, as well as educate the 
public. 
  An equal opportunities tribunal would also be established to 
deal with complaints from those who believed their rights were 
being violated. "This is a human rights court," said Ms. Wu, 
who estimated the new bodies would cost more than $40 million a 
year to run. 
  Under Legislative Council standing orders, the new bill can 
only be tabled with the approval of the Governor, Chris Patten, 
since it involves public expenditure. But Mr. Patten has 
already hinted he would not necessarily block the bill. "I'm 
pretty open-minded about it, but I think there are overlapping 
powers," he told the Sunday Morning Post. "We haven't yet been 
persuaded of the case, but it's not for me a locked door or a 
shut window." 
  Principal Home Affairs assistant Duncan Pescod, who meets 
Ms. 
Wu tomorrow to discuss the bill, said the Government wanted to 
study the draft in detail before commenting further. 
  If the Governor backs the bill, it is expected to be 
introduced to Legco in May after a two-month consultation 
period. Councillors have already indicated their support for 
the establishment of a rights commission through a motion last 
year. But Beijing is likely to warn against the move, which 
many commentators believe is primarily aimed at protecting human 
rights in Hong Kong after 1997. 
  Pressure over the issue is expected to mount following the 
return from London today of independent legislator Christine Loh 
Kung-wai, who last week urged the House of Commons' foreign 
affairs committee to recommend the creation of a human rights 
commission. Committee members have already indicated they are 
likely to do so in their report this Easter. The Governor said 
he would take such a recommendation "very seriously". 
  Under Ms. Wu's draft bill, the rights tribunal would be 
based 
on a body that exists in Australia. It would consist of a 
president, who must be a judge of at least seven years' 
standing, and two other members. 
  The new court would have almost unlimited powers. It could 
order human rights violators not to repeat unlawful conduct, to 
pay compensation, employ, reinstate or promote victims, or "to 
perform any reasonable act or course of conduct to redress the 
loss and damages suffered by the complainant". The tribunal 
could also impose an interim order to preserve the status quo 
and protect the rights of both parties to the complaint. Those 
who failed to comply with an order of the tribunal would be 
liable to a fine of up to $10,000 for an individual or $50,000 
for a corporate body. 
  Ms. Wu's proposed human rights commission would have fewer 
powers than the tribunal, but a wide-ranging remit to 
investigate potential human rights abuses. 
  It would comprise a president, human rights commissioner, 
sexual discrimination commissioner, racial discrimination 
commissioner and disability discrimination commissioner. All 
would be appointed by the Governor from the ranks of local 
judges, barristers and solicitors. 
  It would even have a remit to examine any proposed law for 
possible human rights violations, upon request by the attorney- 
general, Legislative Council president, or any group of 500 Hong 
Kong people. The committee's terms of reference would allow it 
to "inquire into any act or practice that may be inconsistent 
with, or contrary to, any human right". Any person who believed 
their rights had been violated could lodge a complaint with the 
commission, either as an individual, or on behalf of a group of 
victims. Complaints would be referred to the tribunal if they 
could not be solved by conciliation. Complaints lodged from 
detainers and prisoners could be directly referred to the 
commission, overruling prison rules. 
  The commission would also have the power to subpoena 
evidence 
and examine witnesses with those who failed to comply liable to 
a maximum penalty of $50,000. 
  Ms. Wu said the proposed new bodies would greatly improve 
existing human rights conditions in Hong Kong. "The existing 
court system has its own restrictions," she said. "It is too 
slow and expensive and too few people can get help from the 
Legal Aid Department. But it (the tribunal) would be less 
costly, more efficient, and would also provide legal aid in 
terms of finance and expertise."

  [Text] It was recently found that the original estimate 
for the construction of the No 10 container terminal planned by 
the Hong Kong Government to be built on Lantau Island was too 
short and that there will be a delay of two years. This will 
cause Hong Kong to lose as much as 2 billion dollars. The Hong 
Kong Government is seizing the time to study other channels. 
  It is learned that the cause of the delay is that 
departments 
of the Hong Kong Government underestimated the time needed for 
construction. The estimate of the Hong Kong Government was 
based on past experience, including that of the No 7 and No 8 
container terminals in Kuai Chung and Tsingyi Island, which took 
about five years for design and construction. Therefore, the 
construction of the first container terminal on Lantau Island is 
also based on 5 years and is estimated to be completed and put 
into operation around the end of 1996 or the beginning of 1997. 
  However, upon further study of the design of No 10 container 
terminal, it has been found that the project on Lantau Island is 
more complicated than those in Kuai Chung and Tsingyi Island. 
Two more years is needed for the project; that is, at the 
earliest it can only be completed by the end of 1998. 
  The Hong Kong Government has estimated that the delay for 
two 
years in the construction of the container terminal No 10 will 
cause Hong Kong to suffer an economic loss as much as 2 billion 
dollars. If the No 9 container terminal, on which the Chinese 
side has not yet given its approval, cannot be gradually put 
into service by the middle of 1996 as originally scheduled, but 
has to be delayed for two years, the two container terminals 
will cause Hong Kong to suffer a total economic lose of 4 
billion dollars. 
  Moreover, the loss caused by delay will not be confined to 
the first two years, but will continue to accumulate. This is 
because Kaoshiung in Taiwan, Singapore, and Yantian Port, the 
construction of which will soon be completed in Shenzhen, are 
close to Hong Kong and they will become powerful competitors. 
Because of the delay in the construction of the No 9 and No 10 
container terminals, the navigation lines of some container 
ships can only be shifted to container terminals in neighboring 
areas. It is even more difficult to estimate the long-term 
economic losses of Hong Kong. 
  The Hong Kong Government has, based on the speed of growth 
of 
the container transport volume of Hong Kong, estimated that by 
the end of 1996 it will be necessary for the No 10 container 
terminal to be put into service before all the containers can be 
handled. This estimation is also based on the operation of No 9 
container terminal as scheduled. 
  The Hong Kong Government is seizing the time to study other 
ways, and plans under consideration include giving up the past 
practice of asking financial groups to reclaim land from the sea 
and build the terminal, and instead doing the work directly by 
the government itself. Another plan is to use sea sand to 
reclaim land from the sea. 
  The tentative view of the Hong Kong Government is that the 
plan for the government to reclaim land from the sea and to do 
the construction work may not save time. Therefore, the 
feasibility of this plan is not great. On the other hand, the 
second plan may save as much as six months and may enable No 10 
container terminal to be completed in the beginning of 1998. 
  The Hong Kong Government will appoint, as soon as possible, 
consultant companies to study how fast the method of using sea 
sand to reclaim land can speed up the construction and to study 
if there is any other way that may save even more time.

  [Text] A ship missing for nearly three weeks after being 
boarded by suspected pirates off Taiwan has turned up under 
armed guard in a Chinese port. 
  The discovery just 100 kilometres from Hong Kong has 
prompted 
fears of a renewed crackdown by Guangdong security forces well 
outside their jurisdiction. Maritime rescue centres in Hong 
Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Japan had not heard of the Alicia 
Star since it sent secret cables on January 27 saying it had 
been hijacked by armed pirates on its way from Singapore to 
South Korea. 
  The reports, sent from a hidden transmitter unknown to the 
pirates, said the attackers were dressed in green and had taken 
control of the ship with automatic weapons. 
  The Hong Kong Marine Department had been informed of the 
missing ship and reported it to counterparts in Beijing, but no 
reply had been received. However, the POST has learned through 
London shipping sources that communications over the Lunar New 
Year revealed the 500-tonne ship was under detention in Shanwei, 
just east of Daya Bay. Its cargo, believed to be more than 
U.S.$5 million (HK$38.69 million) worth of cigarettes, has been 
seized by Shanwei port authorities, but the fate of its mainly 
Filipino crew is unknown. 
  According to the initial attack reports, the Panamanian- 
registered ship - a regular caller to Hong Kong was boarded near 
the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines. The 
location is far outside China's 200 nautical mile economic zone 
but close to where a Hong Kong ship was attacked by a Guangdong 
customs patrol boat last April at the height of the last 
crackdown. 
  "This is the first such case for months, so everyone is very 
nervous that we are facing a new wave of attacks on local 
shipping...it's not helped by the fact we are powerless to 
anything over this one [as published]," a Marine Department 
source said. 
  Last year's apparent antismuggling crackdown saw at least 33 
ships attacked, many around Hong Kong waters, in raids by 
Guangdong authorities and suspected pirates. Both official and 
unofficial attacks stopped about the same time after 
international diplomatic and shipping industry pressure on China. 
  A Marine Department paper detailing Chinese official 
involvement in the attacks was circulated among the 
International Maritime Organisation's safety committee but 
watered-down on Foreign Office advice before being officially 
presented.

and Technology in the 1990's"] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 15 January, Song Jian, state 
councillor and minister of the State Science and Technology 
Commission was interviewed by this reporter in the reception 
room at Zhongnanhai, Beijing. He talked about China's 
preparations for scientific and technological development for 
the 1990's, the reform of the science and technology structure, 
and the integration of science and technology. 
  Minister Song Jian is warm and friendly. He is wise and firm 
in his conversational style, analyzing problems brilliantly and 
thoroughly. He has good poise as a leader and demonstrates the 
qualities of a scholar. 
  This reporter had read a brief biography of Song Jian and 
knew that he was not only an outstanding leader in political 
circles but also a scientist with great attainments. As a 
member of the institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he 
is noted in scientific circles for his systematic cybernetics. 
In designing and leading the development of China's 
surface-to-air missile control system, antiballistic-missile 
weapons, nuclear submarine-launched missiles, and 
telecommunications satellites, Mr. Song has made great efforts 
and numerous achievements. The celebrated scientist Qian Xuesen 
once praised Song Jian as a "Chinese authority on cybernetics." 
<H5>  Seize the Opportunity To Quicken Development </H5>
  Minister Song told this reporter that the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, which ended not long 
ago, made an important policy decision about further reforming 
the science and technology structure and clearly stated that the 
goal of science and technology structural reform is to establish 
a new structure which suits the development of the socialist 
market economy, conforms to the laws of the development of 
science and technology themselves, promotes scientific and 
technological progress, and scales new scientific and 
technological heights, to achieve the comprehensive and 
coordinated development of the economy, science, technology, and 
society. He said it is a heartening and achievable goal. 
  He said that Deng Xiaoping recently pointed out: "In 
history, China has not had many opportunities for vigorous 
development." Looking back at history, for various reasons, the 
Chinese had missed several good opportunities for vigorous 
development and this is deeply regretted. China is now faced 
with an opportunity which is very rare in the history of 
development. We must cherish this opportunity and seize it to 
quicken reform and opening up and the pace of development, 
enhance the country's strength, and improve the people's living 
standards. Song Jian said, with deep feeling, that people will 
use this to assess the achievements and inadequacies in the 
future. 
<H5>  Strategic Task For the 1990's </H5>
  This reporter asked him how he interpreted the principle of 
"stabilizing one end and opening up the other end," as stated in 
the "Decision," for scientific and technological development and 
what was the significance of it. 
  Song Jian said: That is an important guiding principle for 
science and technology structural reform. Stabilizing one end 
demands that we make great efforts to ensure the sustained and 
steady development of key basic research projects and high-tech 
research, tackling key scientific and technological problems 
which have a bearing on the national economy and the people's 
livelihood; support and save the stamina for the long-term 
development of science and technology; and continuously bring 
new ideas for technological innovations. Opening up the other 
end means that we need to spur the commercialization, 
industrialization, and internationalization of scientific and 
technological fruits, making a greater contribution to the 
establishment of a socialist market economic system. 
"Stabilizing one end" and "opening up the other end" are 
interdependent. Neither of the two is indispensable. This is a 
crucial step toward settling the question of integrating science 
and technology and the economy. 
  Minister Song Jian stressed: A central question which has 
puzzled us for a long time is the separation between science and 
technology and economic development. Since reform and opening 
up, we have taken a very important step on this question and 
have obtained notable achievements. However, for the complete 
settlement of this question we still need the concerted efforts 
and struggle of the scientific and technological circles and the 
economic and financial circles. 
  He pointed out that establishing a science and technology 
structure which suits the socialist market economy and forming 
an economic structure which is conducive to technological 
progress are important strategic tasks for the 1990's. 
  What aspects should be particularly emphasized in China's 
current scientific and technological development? In reply, 
Song Jian said: 
  --Step up agricultural science and technology. In 
the mid-21st century, China will probably have a population of 
1.6 billion people. Only by maintaining an independent, steady, 
and sufficient supply of farm products can we guarantee the 
survival and development of the Chinese nation and this is 
determined by China's specific national conditions. China needs 
to increase its grain output by 50 percent by that time. In the 
face of the huge population pressure and unpredictable natural 
disasters, the levels of agricultural science and technology 
must be improved very considerably. Therefore, it is an 
immediate task to develop high-yield, quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture. 
  --Quicken the development rate of high and new 
technology. During the 1990's, we will continue to organize 
and guide a large number of scientific research organizations 
and scientific and technical personnel into the market to 
develop high- and new-tech industries. By the end of this 
century, high added-value exports will rise from the current 5 
percent to 10 or 20 percent. We must develop our own high- and 
new-tech industries. We must have great courage, take the 
offensive, open up markets, enhance our strength, participate in 
competition, build up a number of large modern corporations, and 
form an energetic force to compete with the developed nations. 
At that time, our science and technology will occupy a place in 
the world. 
  --Step up basic research. Basic research is the 
fountain of the scientific and technological productive forces, 
the vanguard of new technologies and new inventions, and the 
backing for science and technology as a whole. Once we make 
great breakthroughs in it, it will inevitably mean great 
progress in production technology, in the economy, and in 
society. Therefore, China will maintain a sophisticated, 
high-efficiency, and high-level basic research system as a 
backing for the long-term development of science and technology 
and will increase inputs in it so that we can catch up with the 
world and make new breakthroughs in some of the most important 
basic research disciplines, new research disciplines, and 
interdisciplinary sciences. 
<H5>  An Earnest Hope </H5>
  "The country's future lies in science and technology." This 
is a line from one of Song Jian's poems. He said: The 
scientific and technological circles all over the country are 
shouldering the heavy task of invigorating the motherland with 
science and technology. In order to achieve this historic task, 
it is necessary to mobilize all positive factors, unite friends 
at home and abroad, and struggle devotedly. During the 
conversation, he leafed through the 1994 editions of CHING CHI 
TAO PAO and showed contentment with its development and 
progress. Moreover, he earnestly hoped that CHING CHI TAO PAO 
will contribute more to promoting scientific, technological, and 
economic exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao.

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Zhifang (0719 1807 2455) and Deng Ying </F>
(6772 4481)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Feb (XINHUA) -- China's nuclear safety 
supervision and control system has begun to take shape, 
according to a responsible person of the National Nuclear Safety 
Administration [NNSA]. 
  The responsible person said: Since the seventies, when China 
began to develop its nuclear power industry, it has followed a 
principle of "safety first and quality first." In 1984, the 
NNSA was formed. As a result, the construction and development 
of the nuclear power industry began to have a legal basis. The 
state has promulgated three administrative regulations -- the 
"Regulations Governing the Safety Supervision and Control of 
Civilian Nuclear Facilities," the "Regulations Governing the 
Control of Nuclear Materials," and the "Regulations Governing 
the Emergency Control of Nuclear Accidents in Nuclear Power 
Plants" -- 12 departmental rules and regulations, including 
nuclear safety provisions and implementation rules, as well as 
59 nuclear safety guiding principles. Some nuclear safety laws 
and regulations and technical documents are now being 
formulated. In accordance with the nuclear safety standards 
established by the International Atomic Energy Agency, these 
regulations, rules, and guiding principles stipulate in detail 
the safety standards and quality-guarantee requirements for the 
construction and operation of civilian nuclear facilities. 
  The responsible person continued: China has adopted a safety 
licensing system for civilian nuclear facilities. As far as 
nuclear safety controls are concerned, we have followed the 
principle that "the law should be enacted first so that there is 
something to be observed, and that once implemented, the law 
should be enforced to the letter." To promote scientific 
standards in its work, the NNSA has established a nuclear safety 
committee consisting of 32 noted experts from various technical 
fields. The committee provides consultation services concerning 
the safety examination and evaluation, supervision, and control 
of civilian nuclear facilities. In addition, a nuclear safety 
center was established in Beijing to undertake the task of 
providing technical information for nuclear safety controls. 
The center is engaged in the technical evaluation, testing, 
monitoring, and data analysis of nuclear safety. A total of 
three supervisory stations have been set up in Shanghai, 
Guangdong, and Chengdu, with each being responsible for the 
supervision of nuclear safety in east China, south China, and 
the western region, respectively. In terms of providing 
technical means to guarantee nuclear safety, China has already 
established a training center equipped with a simulated nuclear 
power plant and has developed a batch of advanced software for 
analyzing and evaluating nuclear safety, with some of these 
having been used in the safety appraisals of nuclear power 
plants. Meanwhile, a system for responding to and evaluating 
nuclear accidents has also been established.

  [Text] Beijing, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Scientists at the 
China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE) have installed a second 
beam line on a tandem accelerator. 
  This advanced achievement, important for research into 
astrophysics, has passed appraisal by a committee consisting of 
several academicians of the China Academy of Sciences. 
  According to scientists at the laboratory, tandem 
accelerators are being used for research only in a few state 
laboratories in the United States and Japan. 
  The beam line on CIAE's tandem accelerator is China's first. 
It has produced two radioactive beams -- known to experts as 
"C-11" and "F-17" beams -- for the first time in the country. 
  This means that it is now possible to do research on 
unstable 
nuclei far from stability. Previously, nuclear physics was 
restricted to examining about 2,000 nuclides produced by ions of 
stable isotopes. 
  This will eventually lead to a better understanding of the 
nature of nuclear reactions and the nuclear structure, according 
to scientists. 
  Chinese scientists at the CIAE and elsewhere have conducted 
205 experiments using the CIAE's tandem accelerator since 1988.

Technology Trade Exceeds 20 Billion Yuan"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The State 
Science and Technology Commission today announced that the trade 
volume in technology contracts across the country in 1993 was 
20.755 billion yuan, a 37.42 percent increase over the previous 
year. 
  According to statistics from the technology markets in 34 
provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities listed 
separately for development in the country (excluding Tibet and 
Shenzhen), the technology transaction volume in 25 localities 
exceeded 100 million yuan; Beijing Municipality, with its 3.5 
billion yuan volume of technology transactions, ranked first, 
followed by Liaoning and Shanghai, each with 2 billion yuan. 
They were followed by Sichuan, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, 
Hunan, Henan, and Hubei, arranged according to transaction 
volume. 
  The statistics show that the overall standard of trade in 
the 
technology markets across the country has greatly improved, and 
that the transaction volume of technological achievements 
involved a wide range of areas. This shows that the sense of 
technological progress among various quarters in society is 
ceaselessly becoming stronger. The statistics also show that at 
the same time as the volume of technology transactions has 
increased rapidly, the scale of technology transactions has also 
expanded continuously. In 1993, on average, each contract 
involved a transaction volume of 84,380 yuan, whereas in 1992 it 
was only some 60,000 yuan, and this indicates that in terms of 
degree of industrialized development, grade, and quality, the 
technological goods entering the market have improved to varying 
degrees, and some technologies and technological products have 
already left the country for the outside world.

Billion Joint-Venture Integrated Circuit Plant To Be Set Up in 
Shenzhen, Involving Shenzhen, European, and Hong Kong 
Businessmen"] 
  [Text] The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Grand-Scale [chao da gui mo 
6389 1129 6016 2875] Integrated Circuit Plant, China's biggest 
integrated circuit project--announced in Shenzhen yesterday the 
establishment of its Chinese investment company. This project 
investment company will set up a joint venture with a major 
European integrated circuit company to engage in the manufacture 
of chips and the finishing process for grad-scale integrated 
circuits in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. It is estimated that the 
entire production scale will entail a total investment of over 
$1 billion (about 7.7 billion Hong Kong dollars). 
  Wang Dianpu, director of the Shenzhen Saige [6357 2706] 
Group, a major shareholder in the Chinese investment company, 
indicated when attending a meeting marking the establishment of 
the project's Chinese investment company in Shenzhen yesterday, 
that the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Grand-Scale Integrated Circuit 
Project is a national-level high-tech project which was approved 
by the State Planning Commission in July 1991 and which has the 
backing of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and relevant leaders of 
the State Council. After more than two years' preparation, the 
project's Chinese investment company, namely Shenzhen Saige 
High-Tech Joint-Stock Investment Company Limited, was finally 
set up in Shenzhen with a registered capital of 280 million 
yuan. The company has the following five shareholders: The 
Shenzhen Saige Group as the assets trustee for the Shenzhen 
Government (with a 62.2-percent shareholders' rights); the 
Shenzhen New Industry Investment Company Incorporated (with 7.1 
percent shareholders' rights); the Shenzhen Urban Construction 
Group (with a 12.5-percent shareholders' right); the Shenzhen 
Zhongcheng Electronics Industrial Investment Joint-Stock Company 
Limited (with a 10.7-percent shareholders' right); and the 
Shenzhen Changhe Industrial Company Limited (with a 7.1-percent 
shareholders' right; this company is a joint venture between 
Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Holdings Limited, Hutchison Whampoa 
Company Limited, and relevant companies in Shenzhen). Wang 
Dianpu also noted that it is just a temporary arrangement that 
the company consists of the aforementioned five shareholders 
only and the company plans to invite a number of major 
enterprises in Shenzhen to be shareholders. 
  Wang Dianpu pointed out that the Shenzhen Saige High-Tech 
Joint-Stock Investment Company Limited, during the coming 
period, will place stress on developing the design, manufacture, 
packing, testing technology, and supplementary industries for 
grand-scale integrated circuits. To this end, the company will 
make full use of all preferential policies granted by the state; 
develop new and high technology; carry out diversified 
operations; uphold the orientation of internationalizing 
investment, product, market, technology, able personnel, and 
management; and explore and create a new pattern for China's 
new- and high-tech industries. From a long-term point of view, 
the company plans to turn itself into a pluralistic 
transnational company with real economic strength. 
  The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Grand-Scale Integrated Circuit 
Project 
will be developed by phases in the form of a Sino-foreign joint 
venture. The first phase of the project includes the 
establishment of a factory and design center in Shenzhen's 
Futian Bonded Zone for the finishing prossess for grand-scale 
integrated circuits, which will occupy an area of 37,000 square 
meters. The joint venture will introduce world first class 
production equipment and technology for the design, packaging, 
and testing of integrated circuits of all kinds. The designed 
production capacity in the first phase is expected to be 318 
million pieces of packaged integrated circuits and most of the 
products will be sold overseas. Entailing a total investment of 
nearly $1 billion, the project will be jointly developed by the 
Chinese investment company and an international first class 
microelectronics company. The integrated circuit packaging and 
testing factory for the joint venture will have the country's 
highest output volume, largest production scale, and most 
advanced technologies. The establishment of this project is of 
great strategic significance to enhancing the level of China's 
electronic industry, narrowing the gap between the electronic 
technologies of China and the world, building up an electronic 
industrial base in southern China, and to pushing forward the 
industrial development of the Zhu Jiang Delta. 
  The second phase of the project includes the establishment 
of 
a world standard factory in Hong Kong for the initial processing 
of grand-scale integrated circuits, thus turning the 
Shenzhen-Hong Kong region into China's integrated circuit 
production and export base. It has been learned that a 34,000 
square meter factory for this purpose will be set up in Hong 
Kong's Tai Po industrial town, which the Saige Group purchased 
earlier. Recently, Hong Kong's Industrial Department planned to 
withdraw the land as no construction had been carried out on it 
long after the purchase; however, the Industrial Department 
recently agreed to an extension. An investment of over $1 
billion is needed for both the initial and finishing processes 
to develop to an appropriate scale. At present, the first phase 
of construction has entered the contract-signing stage and the 
foreign partner is a first class major European integrated 
circuit company. 
  Both the Chinese and foreign parties have agreed to examine 
and approve the Chinese and English versions of three contracts 
in early February; examine memorandums and the constitution of 
the joint venture; and sign the three formal contracts upon the 
approval of the boards of directors on both sides. According to 
relevant plans, after the factory for the finishing process is 
set up in Shenzhen's Futian Bonded Zone, it will first engage 
itself in processing materials supplied by clients to gain 
initial economic results; it will then expand the production 
scale according to market changes and attain rollover 
development relying mainly on the efficiency of the joint 
venture. The finishing process is expected to be put into 
production next year.

  The new development, under the name of "Yinhe (milk way) 
power supply system for computer-monitoring, unmanned and 
computer-controlled telephone switchboards", has passed a state 
technical appraisal in this capital of central China's Hunan 
Province. 
  The system, China's first of its kind, was developed by 
researchers with the China National Defense Science and 
Technology University based in Changsha, the Hunan Provincial 
Posts and Telecommunications Research Institute and the Changsha 
Rixin Electrical Appliance Plant. 
  Previously, China relied heavily on similar imported power 
supply systems for its posts and telecommunications sector. 
Such foreign products were not only expensive but also 
inconvenient to repair. Some of the imported ones do not have a 
computer-monitoring function. 
  Experts from the appraisal group say that some technical 
functions of the newly-developed system have reached 
international advanced standards, while the price is two-thirds 
that of the imported ones.

<F P=106> [By Robert J. Saiget] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 10 KYODO -- China's environment is 
seriously threatened and a system of law and enforcement is 
urgently needed to prevent pollution and protect natural 
resources, the chief of the country's environmental watchdog has 
warned. 
  Qu Geping, chairman of the environmental protection 
committee 
of the National People's Congress (NPC), made the call in a 
speech given at a closed meeting of an NPC conference on the 
environment last December 15 and only recently made available. 
  Qu methodically laid out the serious problems of growing 
pollution emissions and overexploitation of natural resources as 
China's economy develops. 
  Air pollution is steadily increasing in China's 500 major 
cities, as smoke and dust emissions have grown at an average 
annual rate of 7.6 percent and sulfur dioxide emissions increase 
by 3.5 percent, making several cities "invisible to satellites," 
Qu said. 
  Although industrial emissions may be controlled by 2000, he 
said, sulfur dioxide emissions, the leading cause of acid rain, 
will rise from 16 million tons per year now to up to 23 million 
tons in 2000. 
  Such increases will come as China's annual coal consumption 
grows from the present 1.2 billion tons to a projected 1.6 
billion tons early next century when experts predict China will 
be the largest single producer of both carbon dioxide, the 
leading cause of global warming, and sulfur dioxide. 
  Qu said China presently produces 100 million tons of 
wastewater a day, leaving several rivers "in a state of crisis." 
By 2000 China will produce between 30-32 billion tons of 
industrial wastewater annually and 17 billion tons of organic 
wastewater, he said. 
  During the 1980s, acid rain was limited to the provinces of 
Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou and Sichuan, but now has appeared in 
Jiangxi, Fujian and Shandong, and if not controlled will greatly 
harm the agricultural, livestock and fishing industries, he said. 
  Nearly six billion tons of solid wastes cover an area of 
more 
than 50,000 hectares around China and by 2000, industrial solid 
wastes will grow from the present 180 million tons a year to 250 
million tons annually, Qu said. 
  Qu also described an increasingly unbalanced ecological 
situation which includes diminishing forest cover, soil erosion 
due to excessive mining and road-building and an average loss of 
some 2,100 square kilometers of arable land per year to 
desertification. 
  Water sources are also diminishing faster than they can be 
replaced as more than 300 of China's 500 large cities are short 
of water, with more than 40 seriously lacking water, he said. 
  China's per capita arable land is two-fifths the size of the 
world average and is shrinking due to mining, road construction 
and economic development, as well as the hazards of increase 
chemical use in fertilizers, he said. 
  As much as 10 million hectares of arable land are affected 
by 
pollution, which Qu said costs up to 12 billion kilograms of 
grain in economic losses a year. 
  Uncontrolled mining, low rates of mineral recovery at 
existing mines and low utilization ratios were quickly depleting 
resource reserves that, using China's present day technology, 
are readily exploitable. 
  The unusually frank speech, while stressing the 
interrelation 
between ecological imbalances and economic development, called 
for the perfection of China's legislative system and 
authoritative laws capable of enforcing environmental 
legislation.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Automobile Engine 
Electronic-Control System Limited Company, supported and 
organized by the state, was inaugurated in Beijing on 2 
February. According to authoritative sources, the establishment 
of this trans-regional and trans-departmental company has great 
significance for plans to upgrade the technology of China's 
automobile industry and change the fact the industry is widely 
dispersed, redundant, is small and all-inclusive, and is of low 
quality. 
  The automobile engine computer control system is known as 
the 
electronic jet system for short. It uses a microcomputer rather 
than a mechanical carburetor and oil distributor to bring the 
gasoline supply and ignition of the engine under precise 
control. It can markedly improve the performance of an 
automobile and reduce exhaust pollution. It is now widely used 
by the car industry worldwide. In China, with the development 
of the automobile industry, there are broad market prospects for 
the electronic jet system. It was included as one of the 
scientific and technological research projects listed in the 
state's Eighth Five-Year Plan. 
  Under the specific command of state departments concerned, a 
number of key enterprises in the automobile, electronics, and 
ordnance industries became limited liability companies to help 
jointly develop the project to ensure it started with high 
technology, that there would be economic mass production and 
specialization, and that production would be organized to take 
advantage of economies of scale. 
  The Automobile Engine Electronic-Control System Limited 
Company was formed by the Shanghai Automobile Industrial 
Company, the Harbin Automobile Electronics Company, the Wuxi 
Automobile Electronic Jet Group, and the Xian Kunlun Machinery 
Plant, with a total investment of more than 1.5 billion yuan. 
The company was registered in Shanghai. 
  Minister in Charge of State Economics and Trade Commission 
Xu 
Penghang, Machine-Building Industry Minister He Guangyuan, 
Electronics Industry Minister Hu Qili, and Shanghai Vice Mayor 
Jiang Yiren attended the ceremony for the signing of the 
cooperation agreement.

<F P=106> [By reporters He Ping (0149 1627) and Jiang Zuozhong (3068 </F>
0146 0022)] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- After cutting the 
ribbon at a ceremony marking the commercial operation of the No. 
1 generating unit at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station in 
Guangdong, Li Peng, premier of the State Council, went to 
Huizhou to conduct inspections and extend Spring Festival 
greetings to local residents. Li Peng said: Guangdong is at the 
forefront of reform and opening up, having made rapid progress 
in all fields of work since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee. It is hoped that the people of 
Guangdong Province will achieve new and even greater success in 
the new year under the inspiration of the guidelines of the 14th 
CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee. 
  Li Peng had toured Huizhou in February 1990. Under the 
guidance of the party's basic line, Huizhou City has made rapid 
progress in economic construction over the past four years, and 
it is now a thriving city. 
  On the morning of 7 February, Premier Li Peng and Ding 
Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, 
eagerly viewed an exhibition of Huizhou City's industrial goods. 
Color televisions, videocassette recorders, high-quality stereo 
equipment, facsimile printers, and telephones on display in the 
exhibition hall demonstrated Huizhou City's achievements in 
electronic industrial development in recent years. It is 
reported that the output value of Huizhou City's electronic 
industry currently totals 5.162 billion yuan annually, making 
this industry the mainstay of the city's industrial sector. Li 
Peng was very delighted to see the exhibits. As he viewed the 
exhibits, he questioned workers at the exhibition hall in detail 
about the products' functions, prices, and sales. He urged 
local cadres to build on their leading products, to develop more 
new products, and to tap foreign and domestic markets in light 
of their own special conditions. 
  Aside from developing its economy in recent years, Huizhou 
city has paid attention to investment in educational services, 
which totaled 359 million yuan last year after increasing at an 
average annual rate of 31.9 percent. After visiting the 
exhibition, Li Peng also made a special trip to the No. 8 
Huizhou City Middle School to visit the teachers and students 
there. When the teachers and students saw the premier, they 
swarmed around him to shake his hand. For his part, Li Peng 
warmly greeted them and offered season's greetings to the 
teachers who worked hard on the educational front. 
  Huizhou city was heavily decorated and shrouded in a joyous 
atmosphere prior to the Spring Festival. Pots of kumquat, 
chrysanthemums, gladioli, daffodils, and tulips lined the 
streets, adding a spring touch to the winter of this southern 
city. Amid the hustle and bustle, Li Peng had cordial 
conversations and exchanged season's greetings with flower 
growers and city residents. 
  Before his tour of Huizhou, Li Peng had inspected 
infrastructure and some new and high technology projects in 
Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen from 28 January-5 
February. He had held informal discussions with local leading 
party and government comrades. Li Peng said: The more we 
develop the economy, the more we should bear in mind the need to 
show concern for and help with the well-being of people in 
impoverished areas. The more we reform and open up, the more we 
should strengthen spiritual civilization and create a fine 
social environment for reform and development. 
  Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau 
and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee; 
Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin; and responsible comrades from 
relevant State Council departments accompanied Li Peng on his 
tour.

<F P=106> [Article by Xue Jianhua (5641 1696 5478): "For the Sake of </F>
National Interests and National Honor -- An Interview With State 
Vice President Rong Yiren"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Feb (XINHUA) -- When Rong Yiren was 
interviewed a few years ago, he was the head of the China 
International Investment and Trust Corporation [CITIC] and had 
just been named by a well-known U.S. economic monthly as one of 
"50 renowned entrepreneurs in the world." The magazine 
commented: "They are powerful figures in industrial development 
and represent important trends. Over the next few years, they 
will play an influential role on a broad scale." 
  When he was interviewed again this time around, Rong Yiren 
was already the PRC's vice president. Nevertheless, his wise 
eyes, kindly smile, and cordial tone remained 
unchanged...[ellipses as received] 
<H5>  In the New Post </H5>
  Rong Yiren was elected PRC vice president at the First 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] on 27 
March 1993. It is now fully 10 months later. 
  Rong Yiren said: "I was vice chairman of the NPC Standing 
Committee, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and 
Commerce [ACFIC], and chairman of CITIC. However, I spent the 
better part of my time on CITIC's business. Now that I have 
assumed the Vice Presidency, I have resigned my posts as CITIC 
and ACFIC chairman." 
  "In my position as vice president, I mainly assist the 
president in some work," said Rong Yiren. As vice president, 
Rong Yiren has had a very busy schedule of state functions since 
April 1993. He visited Portugal and Spain, and received and met 
88 delegations from various parts of the world, as well as from 
the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao area. Shortly after the new 
year began, he met a number of important visitors, such as the 
Azerbaijani foreign minister, the Zimbabwean foreign minister, 
U.S. senators, and the Romanian minister of state. 
  Asked whether he was busier than in the past after assuming 
the vice presidency, Rong Yiren said: "I cannot say that I am 
busier because I also had a lot of work to do at CITIC, only 
that my current job is more politically oriented and more 
demanding." 
  He said: As vice president, I represent national interests 
and the national honor. In dealing with foreigners, we should 
brief them factually on China's situation, provide them 
information on matters that they want to understand, and 
patiently explain things that they do not quite understand. We 
should respect both our guests and ourselves, but our main 
purpose is to enhance and expand international contact and 
friendship. 
<H5>  "President Jiang Zemin Takes My Opinions Seriously" </H5>
  Rong Yiren said: "In performing my work, I often exchange 
views with President Jiang Zemin. President Jiang Zemin takes 
my opinions seriously. We cooperate very well." 
  On his relations with President Jiang Zemin, Rong Yiren 
recalled happily: "Our friendship has existed for a long time, 
and our relations have always been good. Our contacts were 
especially numerous in 1979, when Jiang Zemin was vice chairman 
of the State Commission on the Administration of Foreign 
Investment and I was the adviser. 
  "When Jiang Zemin was subsequently appointed minister of the 
electronics industry and I was the head of CITIC, we also had a 
lot of contacts relating to our work. When Jiang Zemin was 
mayor of Shanghai and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party 
Committee, I made a point of visiting with him when I went to 
Shanghai." 
  Speaking of his domestic tasks, Rong Yiren said that because 
his previous work had primarily been in the economic field, his 
main domestic tasks had been to conduct investigations and study 
to find out about the situation, as well as to review the 
findings and present them to relevant departments in the form of 
ideas and suggestions. 
  On top of his busy schedule of receiving foreign guests, 
Rong 
Yiren spent a lot of time reviewing materials and studying 
issues. Last May and November, he successively visited Jiangsu 
Province and Tianjin Municipality to investigate and learn about 
the situation there; he gained a lot from those visits. He 
said: "By and large, my work has proceeded very smoothly." 
<H3>  The Year 1993 Laid a Very Good Foundation for Future 
Development </H3>
  In evaluating China's economic situation in 1993, Rong Yiren 
said: Generally speaking, 1993 was a year in which we 
implemented Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, seized opportunities, deepened reform, 
developed the economy rapidly and satisfactorily, and continued 
to score success. China's situation underwent tremendous 
changes after Deng Xiaoping delivered his talks during his tour 
of southern China in early 1992. At the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee last year, we finally reached 
a consensus regarding the experience we had gained from more 
than a decade of exploration: to establish a socialist market 
economic system. 
  Rong Yiren said: The Chinese economy grew at an average 
rate of around 9 percent annually between 1980 and 1991, and it 
grew 12.8 percent in 1992 and around 13 percent in 1993. This 
continuous rapid growth is rare in the world. The reason China 
scored tremendous achievements in economic construction last 
year was primarily the result of its emphasis on deepening 
reform, opening up wider to the outside world, and strengthening 
macroeconomic regulations and control, which enabled economic 
construction to proceed more orderly than in the past. At 
present, China is socially and politically stable, its 
agriculture continues to reap bumper harvests, its industrial 
production grows rapidly, its domestic market enjoys brisk 
business, its foreign trade is active, its people's livelihood 
continues to improve, and its overall economic strength is 
increasing. All this has laid a good foundation for further 
development in 1994 and after. 
  He said: In light of China's basic situation and the 
intrinsic need for establishing a socialist market economic 
structure, China's next-step reform will, on the whole, still be 
carried out in an orderly way, step by step, and actively but 
prudently. Whenever a reform measure is promulgated, the 
capability of the state and the people to stand strains will be 
taken into full consideration so as to foster both economic 
development and social stability through reform. 
  Speaking of this year's growth rate, Rong Yiren believed the 
currently set 9 percent rate is well-founded. He said: 
"Although the rate is a bit lower than that of the last year, 
it is actually not low. China's economy will follow the course 
of sustained, rapid, and healthy development. Nine percent is a 
fairly reasonable rate. The growth rate is set between 8 and 9 
percent for the entire Eighth Five-Year Plan precisely because 
this will help arouse the initiatives of all quarters while 
ensuring the healthy and orderly progress of economic 
construction." 
  Rong Yiren stressed: Among reform, development, and 
stability, reform takes the lead. Without reform, there would 
be no development. Meanwhile, without stability -- that is 
without social and political stability -- reform and development 
would become idle talk. This is why we consider development the 
purpose, reform the motive power, and stability the guarantee. 
We hope to promote development through reform. Only with 
development of the economy and improvement of the people's 
living standards can there be political and social stability. 
Moreover, stability will further help deepen the reform. This 
is the main experience of China's reform and opening up over the 
last decade and more. 
<H3>  It Is Still Necessary To Stress Plain Living and Hard 
Struggle Today </H3>
  Rong Yiren said: Although we have made great achievements in 
economic development, we still have a long way to go to reach 
our goal. We have set the goal to build the country into a 
moderately developed country within half a century. We still 
have a long way to go to reach this goal, and we still need to 
exert considerable efforts. 
  He said: "It is still necessary for China to advocate plain 
living and hard struggle, and diligence and frugality, and to 
make further progress with a strong determination." He 
criticized certain localities for being wasteful and extravagant 
as soon as their economic conditions improve. He said: "This 
development is very bad; it should be resolutely stopped." 
  Rong Yiren said: We cannot turn China into a modern 
socialist country with Chinese characteristics without going 
through a long period of plain living and hard struggle to 
overcome one difficulty after another. Our principle is: 
Strive to minimize twists and turns to make development more 
steady. 
  Speaking of relations between the Chinese mainland and Hong 
Kong, Rong Yiren said: Hong Kong, as an important international 
financial and trade region, is closely tied to the mainland's 
economic development. The considerable growth of Hong Kong's 
international trade volume in recent years cannot be separated 
from the mainland's development and support. This is precisely 
as Premier Li Peng has said: "Hong Kong's economy and that of 
the mainland have become inseparable." 
  Rong Yiren said: Recently, because of the British 
Government's failure to keep its words and because of its 
uncooperative attitude, the Sino-British talks have broken down. 
This has created certain trouble and problems. It is natural 
that the Hong Kong compatriots should become worried. However, 
no matter what happens, the Chinese Government will adhere to 
the principles of "one country, two systems" and "letting the 
people in Hong Kong administer Hong Kong." This principle will 
not change. Together with patriotic compatriots in all circles 
of Hong Kong, we will adhere to the principle of the "Basic Law" 
to maintain long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong.

<F P=106> ["Special feature" by special reporter Huang Jo-hung (7806 </F>
5387 4767): "Zhu Rongji Visited Haicang Three Times"] 
  [Text] The fourth day of February 1994, Lichun, the 
Beginning of Spring, the first of the 24 solar terms of the 
year, was an unusual day for Xiamen's Haicang Investment Zone, 
which has always attracted attention from people at home and 
abroad. An epoch-marking event happened that day in Haicang, 
which has been undergoing development for more than 300 years. 
  That day, Zhu Rongji, Standing Committee member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State 
Council, once again inspected Haicang. That was his third visit 
to Haicang, which he previously inspected in March and July 1992. 
  A noticeable fact was that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji also 
brought the principal leaders of more than 10 state departments, 
including the State Planning Commission, the Economic and Trade 
Commission, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry 
of Finance before the expiration of the land use agreement for 
the "901 Project," to which 20 square kilometers of land was 
allocated. Such a large-scale and high-level group of state 
leaders coming to see an investment and development zone had not 
been seen in the past. This showed that the party and state 
leaders attach great importance to the development of Haicang. 
Of course, as some relevant analysts have concluded, this also 
indicated that a final decision on the use of the 20-square-km 
land preserved for the project launched by Taiwan Plastics would 
soon be made. Haicang's development will then enter a new stage. 
  The state authorities attached great importance to every 
step 
of Haicang's development from the planning stages to the initial 
construction. 
  On 20 May 1989, the State Council issued an official 
document, approving the establishment of a special investment 
zone for Taiwan investors in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone 
and in the districts of Xinglin and Haicang, and investment 
projects inside the zone will enjoy favorable policy treatment. 
  In January 1990, the State Council named the area of 100 
square kilometers in Haicang for the investment project of 
Taiwan Plastics "901 Project," and a special leading group was 
set up to handle this matter. 
  On 2 February 1990, Comrade Li Ruihuan inspected Haicang, 
and 
praised the advantageous conditions there. He proposed that the 
delimitation of the administrative districts should serve the 
purpose of economic development. 
  On 24 February 1990, Premier Li Peng braved the rain to 
inspect Haicang and instructed Haicang to "break conventions and 
adopt special measures to deal with special matters" in its 
development. He also immediately decided that the State Council 
would arrange some loans as start-up funds. 
  Between 16 and 20 September, Comrade Qiao Shi inspected 
Haicang and listened to work reports by local leaders. 
  Between 17 and 19 March 1992 and between 2 and 4 July 1992, 
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji flew to Haicang twice to handle some 
affairs in Haicang's construction. He instructed the 
departments concerned to effectively carry out their tasks, thus 
creating conditions for large-scale development. 
  Party and state leaders Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Yang 
Shangkun, Yao Yilin, Zou Jiahua, and Wang Zhaoguo frequently met 
with leading overseas businessmen in order to promote Haicang's 
development... 
  In the last few years, Haicang continued to be a key focus 
of 
the people's attention. 
  On 4 February, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji led nearly 100 
leaders 
from all the relevant State Council departments and the relevant 
institutions of Fujian Province and Xiamen City to Haicang by 
ship. On the ship, the leaders first listened to the report 
about the construction of Haicang Bridge. At about 1000, Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji and his entourage stepped onto Congyu Pier in 
the southwest part of Haicang. They first inspected the project 
of the Congyu Power Station, which was under full-scale 
construction. The first phase of the project will enable the 
power plant to generate 600,000 kilowatts of electricity. 
There, the leaders expressed gratitude and appreciation to the 
cadres and workers who were working hard on the construction 
side. The motorcade then moved along the broad new roads, 
Maqing Road and Wengjiao Road, and successively visited the 
construction site of Xianglu Polyester Fiber Textile Plant, 
which would produce 180,000 tonnes of polyester products a year, 
the new downtown area of Haicang, the new office building of the 
Haicang Management Committee, and the Xinyang Industrial 
District. On the construction site of Xianglu, Vice Premier Zhu 
talked cordially with the project's responsible people and 
inquired about the project's progress and the difficulties they 
were facing. Vice Premier Zhu indicated that the state 
authorities would, as usual, continue to help Haicang solve 
problems in its construction. In the Haicang Management 
Committee's office, Vice Premier Zhu listened to the responsible 
officials' work reports about the planning for the construction 
of the investment zone and the conditions of the construction 
projects. He fully affirmed Haicang's changes and developments 
and said gladly that, as compared with the conditions in 1992, 
Haicang's transformation and development are indeed impressive. 
  During his inspection tour, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
expressed 
important opinions on Haicang's construction and development in 
the next stage. In particular, he changed the name of the 
"Haicang Taiwan Investment Zone" officially used by the State 
Council's 1989 document into the "Haicang Project Investment 
Zone." This showed that the Haicang Investment Zone would be 
further opened to investors from all parts of the world, and 
would welcome investors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas 
areas, and it would not be simply opened to Taiwan investors. 
On the other hand, this indicated certain major and large-scale 
projects would be introduced to Haicang. 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji also instructed that the 
construction 
of Congyu Power Plant and the coal dock in Congyu be quickened 
in order to strengthen the infrastructure facilities, and that 
the civil engineering part of the Xianglu polyester project be 
carried out intensively, and that the equipment be installed 
properly to that it may be put into operation according to 
schedule. At the same time, efforts should be continued to 
advance the preliminary and preparatory work of other projects, 
thus creating a new situation in Haicang's development.

<F P=106> [By reporter Jin Xiaoming (6855 1420 2494)] </F>
  [Text] Chengdu, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- Enduring the hardships of 
a long journey, Zhu Rongji, Standing Committee member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State 
Council, and a number of leading comrades of State Council 
ministries and commissions, arrived in the vast land of Sichuan 
on 5 February on a inspection tour. They brought with them new 
year's greetings from the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council to Sichuan's 100 million people. 
  During their stay in Sichuan, Comrade Zhu Rongji attended a 
spring festival group greetings ceremony sponsored by Sichuan 
Province and Chongqing City. He met with and extended cordial 
greetings to local party, government, and military leaders as 
well as retired veteran comrades and fully affirmed the 
achievements made by Sichuan Province in all fields in recent 
years. He said that not only did Sichuan rapidly develop its 
economy last year, but it also quite satisfactorily handled the 
relationship between reform and development and stability. He 
urged the province to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, 
open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability in 
the new year to win greater victories. 
  During the inspection tour, Zhu Rongji and his party also 
went down to factory workshops and research institutes to pay 
new year's calls on workers and research personnel working on 
the front line of production. They also joined plant managers 
in offering "group diagnosis" to enterprises having difficulties. 
  On the afternoon of 6 February, Zhu Rongji and his party 
arrived at the Chongqing No. 1 Cotton Mill, where he held a 
"forum for difficult enterprises," which was attended by plant 
directors and managers of nine difficult enterprises. Comrade 
Zhu Rongji earnestly listened to the plant directors and 
managers on their situations and analyzed the causes of their 
problems and difficulties. He pointed out: The first thing we 
must do to build a modern enterprise system is to separate 
enterprises from the government. The government must not 
command enterprises blindly; enterprises shall make their own 
decisions regarding operations and management. Plant directors 
shall take responsibility for mistakes. All this should be 
institutionalized to allow supervision by the workers. Those 
enterprises with liabilities greater than assets and without any 
hope of stopping losses should go bankrupt on a trial basis and 
then undertake reorganization to begin a new life. Zhu Rongji 
also pointed out: Reform of the social insurance system is 
essential to a smooth shift of the operating mechanism and the 
safeguard of social stability at the same time. 
  Zhu Rongji encouraged directors of difficult enterprises, 
saying: Difficulties are only temporary; the future is bright. 
Temporary difficulties can definitely be resolved step by step. 
While state policies will be instrumental to resolving 
problems, enterprises must rely primarily on themselves to 
regenerate through self-reliance and hard struggle, through 
market research and new products development, and through 
strengthened management and the change of operating mechanism. 
Enterprises must direct their attention inward to improve 
internal management. At present, special attention must be paid 
to the workers' livelihood to ensure their basic livelihood and 
the stability of society. 
  He Chunlin, Chen Jinhua, Wang Zhongyu, Gu Xiulian, Yu Zhen, 
Li Yanling, Dai Xianglong, Li Yizhong, Pan Liansheng (3382 5571 
3932), and Zhang Xianghai accompanied Zhu Rongji in his 
inspection of Sichuan.

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Li Wei (2621 0251): "State Planning </F>
Commission Minister Chen Jinhua and Provincial Leaders Hu Fuguo 
and Sun Wensheng Inspect Xinzhou, Shuozhou, and Taiyuan"] 
  [Text] State Planning Commission Minister Chen Jinhua, 
Shanxi Provincial Party Secretary Hu Fuguo, and Sun Wensheng, 
deputy secretary and acting governor, went to Xinzhou, Shuozhou, 
Taiyuan, and other localities to conduct investigation and study 
from 20 to 26 January. They also inspected the progress of the 
Wanjiazhai project for diverting water from the Huang He. They 
held forums with the provincial organs on market, prices, and 
other issues. Chen Jinhua said that, with strategic foresight, 
Shanxi has focused on infrastructural building in developing its 
economy. It is indeed encouraging to see the vigor of the 
people throughout the province in changing Shanxi's outlook. 
Shanxi also had sound judgment in mobilizing the whole province 
to develop "Project Hope." We have the responsibility to show 
our concern and give assistance. 
  Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning Commission, 
arrived in Taiyuan on 20 January with comrades responsible for 
the Agricultural Department, Transportation Department, and 
Investment Department under the State Planning Commission. 
After listening to an account given by the Shanxi Planning 
Committee and the Wanjiazhai project headquarters on diverting 
water from the Huang He, they inspected some large- and 
medium-size enterprises, including the Shanxi Textile Mill and 
Taiyuan Heavy Machine Plant. From 21 to 24 January, Chen 
Jinhua, Hu Fuguo, and Sun Wensheng went to conduct investigation 
and study in Ningwu, Shuzhou, Pianguan, Baode, Shenchi, and 
Xinzhou and inspect the progress of the Wanjiazhai project for 
diverting water from the Huang He. Then they went to the 
Taiyuan Iron and Steel Complex and the Mining Machine-Building 
Plant to conduct investigation and study. They also inspected 
the expansion project for the Taiyuan Airport and the Taiyuan 
Railway Station. Chen Jinhua, Hu Fuguo, and Sun Wensheng 
examined in detail the key water diversion project and culvert 
and walked into the tunnel, which was still under construction, 
to perform a quality check. They extended their greetings to 
officials and construction workers involved in the project. 
Chen Jinhua pointed out: The project for diverting water from 
the Huang He to the Shanxi is a great event. As Shanxi is the 
country's base for energy, heavy industry, and chemical 
industry, the water diversion project has attracted nationwide 
attention. He affirmed that, as always, the State Planning 
Commission will show concern for and support the project. 
Construction has started for the key project, main canal, and 
north trunk. The State Planning Commission will take concerted 
action to ensure that the project is completed on time and will 
deliver water to Taiyuan in 1998. 
  Chen Jinhua said that, under the leadership of the 
provincial 
party committee and government, the people of the entire 
province are enthusiastic about changing Shanxi's outlook. I am 
encouraged about the good and valuable things that I have 
personally seen. Li Shuangliang's [Shanxi deputy to the 8th 
National People's Congress] method of handling the province's 
problem of accumulated spent coal is unique nationwide, and this 
spirit of transforming the country's outlook is valuable. In my 
view, the strategy of Shanxi's economic development conforms to 
the spirit of the 14th Party Congress, is based on the current 
situation and focused on the 21st century, and is based on 
Shanxi while having the country and the world in mind. You have 
promoted current economic growth and accumulated staying power 
for further development, which will play a great role in 
upgrading Shanxi's economy in the 1990's and will create 
conditions for development in the next century. The efforts 
made by the provincial party committee and government to step up 
infrastructure building are farsighted. Chen Jinhua made the 
following three proposals for Shanxi's economic development: 
First, as Shanxi has favorable conditions for its economic 
development, structural readjustment, and optimized distribution 
of resources, I hope that you can introduce bold reforms in 
ownership and accelerate the development of collective and 
township enterprises. Second, it is necessary to update the 
concept of proportional relations between heavy industry and 
light industry and let heavy and light industries complement 
each other. Third, regarding projects included in the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to concentrate forces to 
implement the plan, make efforts to check inflation, and prevent 
investment in capital construction from exceeding general supply. 
  Chen Jinhua called for doing well the following work 
regarding market and prices: First, take note of maintaining 
the overall balance and never let the difference between general 
supply and demand exceed 5 percent. Second, attach importance 
to agriculture and the "vegetable basket" project, protect the 
interests of the broad masses of the people, and guarantee 
social stability. Third, it is necessary to properly handle the 
extent of price reform and the timing of introducing reform 
packages. Fourth, offer correct media guidance for forecasting 
the inclination of the masses. Fifth, in management over 
prices, it is necessary to combine government interference with 
mass supervision and strengthen price work. He emphasized that 
relations among reform, development, and stability should be 
properly handled.

<F P=106> [By FUJIAN RIBAO reporters Wei Zhangguan (7614 4545 1351) </F>
and XINHUA reporter Lin Siding (2651 2448 1353): "During a 
Fact-finding Tour of Eastern Fujian, Wen Jiabao Stresses: Take 
Rural Work Seriously and Care About the Livelihood of Peasants"] 
  [Text] Fuzhou, 9 Feb (XINHUA) -- Wen Jiabao, alternate 
member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and 
member of the Secretariat, pointed out during a fact-finding 
tour of eastern Fujian: Maintaining the stable development of 
the rural economy is now crucial to the smooth implementation of 
overall reform and to the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 
6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. Party 
committees and government at all levels must attach great 
importance to rural work and show genuine concern for the 
livelihood of the peasants to protect and further mobilize their 
initiative. 
  From 5 to 9 February, Wen Jiabao called on peasants in 
impoverished villages, areas around the reservoir, and Yu 
nationality villages in Gutian, Bingnan, Zhouning, and Fuan 
Counties. He inquired of cadres about the peasants' livelihood 
and agricultural production conditions. 
  Wen Jiabao said: This year will be crucial for reform of the 
economic structure. The fundamental tasks in the countryside 
are: To conscientiously implement guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
Central Conference on Rural Work; stabilize the party's basic 
policy for rural areas; deepen rural reform; further mobilize 
the peasants' initiative to promote rural economic growth and 
increase their income; to promote social stability in rural 
areas; and to lay a solid foundation -- and create an excellent 
environment -- for the smooth implementation of the major reform 
measures and the sustained, healthy, rapid development of the 
national economy. 
  Wen Jiabao stressed: China is a big agricultural country 
where peasants account for 80 percent of the population. 
Exercising effective leadership over work in rural areas and 
strengthening the role of agriculture as the foundation of the 
national economy will have a direct bearing on the overall 
situation of economic construction and on the overall stability 
of society. Leadership at all levels in charge of rural work 
must always have the peasants in mind, show concern for them at 
every turn, depend on them in everything, and seek to increase 
the benefits of the peasants in everything they do. We should 
respect the peasants' creative spirit, pay close attention to 
their immediate interests, help them solve their difficulties in 
daily life, and do a good job in guiding, protecting, and 
mobilizing their initiative. At present, we should do all we 
can to promote the rural economy, increase the peasants' income, 
continue efforts to reduce burdens imposed on peasants, improve 
public order in rural areas, and provide technical and 
information services to peasants. We must care about the people 
in old revolutionary base areas, areas inhabited by minority 
nationalities, poverty-stricken areas, disaster-ridden areas, 
and areas around the reservoir, and help them in making 
arrangements for production and livelihood. 
  Wen Jiabao said: The season for spring plowing is around the 
corner. We must prepare well for spring production by helping 
the peasants formulate and implement production plans and by 
organizing ample supplies of means of agricultural production 
like chemical fertilizers, chemicals, farm machinery, and diesel 
oil in order to reap another good harvest; and to ensure amply 
supply and stable prices of vegetables, grains, and edible oils.

  [Text] While inspecting Fujian's eastern rural areas, Wen 
Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee's 
Political Bureau and member of its Secretariat, pointed out: 
Maintaining stable social and economic development in the rural 
areas is very important to ensuring the smooth carrying out of 
reform and the sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the 
national economy. All levels of party committees and governments 
should take serious account of rural work, show concern for the 
peasants' lives, and protect and bring their initiative into 
play. 
  From 5 to 9 February, Wen Jiabao visited some peasants in 
poor mountainous areas in Gutian, Pingnan, Zhouning, and Fuan 
counties and also held discussions with cadres and masses there 
to obtain information about the peasants' lives. 
  Wen Jiabao said: This year is a crucial year for economic 
structural reform. The basic task in rural work is to seriously 
implement the instructions of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee and the central meeting on rural 
work, to stabilize the party's policy on rural areas, deepen 
rural reform, bring peasant initiative into better play, 
stimulate the rural economy, increase peasant income, maintain 
social stability in rural areas, and lay a solid foundation and 
create good conditions for the smooth implementation of all 
major reform measures and for the sustained, speedy, and healthy 
development of the national economy. 
  Wen Jiabao stressed: Leaders in charge of rural work should 
always think of the peasants, show concern for them, rely on 
them, and do everything for them. At present, every possible 
effort should be made to develop the rural economy, increase 
peasants' income, reduce their burden, improve social order in 
the rural areas, and provide technological information for the 
peasants. There is a need to care for the old revolutionary 
base, ethnic, poor areas, and disaster-stricken areas and to 
help the people there make good arrangements in production and 
life. 
  Wen Jiabao said: As spring farming is approaching, we should 
make good arrangements for spring production, help the peasants 
work out and implement production plans, organize the supply of 
chemical fertilizers, farm chemicals, agricultural machinery, 
diesel oil, and other agricultural production materials, ensure 
service before and in the middle of production, and strive to 
reap a good harvest this year.

<F P=106> [By Sun Yong (1327 0516)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- Li Lanqing, vice premier 
of the State Council, invited a number of State Council 
counselors to Zhongnanhai this morning for a informal meeting to 
solicit their views on China's education reform. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Counselors Zhang Houcan, Tang 
Sheng, 
Zhou Xiqing, Lu Deyun, Shen Daming, Tang Zongshun, Deng Yinyin, 
Li Jiahua, and Zhou Jing affirmed the achievements made in 
China's education. At the same time, they pointed out: we 
leaders at all levels should further enhance our awareness of 
the strategic role of education in socialist construction. We 
must set up school disciplines in a scientific way and according 
to the laws governing education. While giving students 
knowledge, we must cultivate their independence and creativity. 
We must strengthen advanced in-service study and training of 
teachers. The counselors also gave their opinions and 
suggestions on raising teachers' pay and benefits as well as 
other issues. 
  Li Lanqing earnestly listened to the counselors' views, 
thanking them for their concern and support of China's 
education. He said: China is a developing country, not well-off 
in economic terms. To run the world's largest educational 
system, it is necessary to gradually increase investment in 
education as the economy develops. The fundamental approach, 
however, is through reform. The State Council and local 
authorities are actively but prudently promoting education 
reform on the basis of the "Outline for China's Education Reform 
and Development" to raise teaching qualities and improve the 
social effect of school education. 
  Li Lanqing said: At present, it is necessary to concentrate 
on improving basic education first. This is a fundamental issue 
affecting the improvement of the entire nation's standards. At 
the same time, we must vigorously develop vocational education 
at the elementary, middle, and secondary levels as well as adult 
education to train more practical personnel needed in society. 
Higher education should be reformed to improve its teaching 
quality and social effects. To make our education more 
successful, it is necessary to raise the awareness of society as 
a whole, particularly the awareness of leading cadres at all 
levels, on the strategic importance of developing education on a 
priority basis, and it is necessary to foster a social ethics of 
respecting teachers and valuing education. Li Lanqing urged all 
counselors to continue their investigation and research in this 
regard and give their views and proposals on improving education 
to the State Council.

  [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- In a circular issued 
the other day, the State Education Commission [SEC] criticized 
the breach of discipline by the Hengyang City Education 
Commission, Shaoyang City, and other units, which have set up 
schools, opened courses, and enrolled students without 
authorization. The circular outlines its suggestions on 
punishment. 
  The circular notes: The "commissioned college level medical 
course" at the Hengyang City Medical Training Center was 
approved in 1992 by the Henyang City Education Commission, which 
overstepped its authority in granting the approval. With this 
approval, the city Public Health Bureau has in the past two 
years recruited 120 students in Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and 
other provinces. The students -- who were required to pay a 
yearly tuition of 2,200 yuan, excluding living expenses -- were 
promised a college level medical diploma from the Henyang Public 
Health School. Most of the enrollees were students who had 
failed to pass the college entrance examinations. Some of them 
were senior high or middle school dropouts, and some were 
workers. None of them were officially enrolled by the 
Provincial Admissions Offices. 
  In September 1992, the training center rented some floor 
space from the Zhongnan Engineering Institute. It also rented 
two classrooms from the middle schools affiliated to the 
engineering institute. They were used as classrooms and 
dormitories for the "commissioned college level medical course." 
  The circular points out: 
  1. The operation of the "commissioned college level medical 
course" was a serious violation of state policy and regulations. 
The Hengyang City Education Commission, which did not refer 
the application to higher competent authorities and overstepped 
its authority in giving the approval, made a serious mistake of 
violating the provision that "no unit or individual is allowed 
to set up schools, enroll students, collect fees from them, or 
issue diplomas without authorization." 
  2. The "training center's" objective in offering the course 
was illegitimate. State laws clearly provide that 
profit-making should not be the goal of schools run by 
nongovernment sectors. By inaugurating the course, a commercial 
vehicle for making a profit, the training center diverted from 
the legitimate goals of school operations. 
  3. As a secondary vocational school, the Hengyang Public 
Health School has committed a serious violation by, without 
first obtaining approval from the state, accepting the 
assignment of the "commissioned college level medical course" 
and giving college level instructions. 
  The incident also uncovers problems with regard to 
implementation of state policy and school administration at the 
Zhongnan Engineering Institute. To increase revenue, the 
institute -- in violation of state regulations -- supported the 
"commissioned college level medical course" sponsored by the 
city public health bureau. Leasing out floor space made 
conditions at the once relatively commodious institute rather 
cramped, creating confusion in campus administration. Moreover, 
the institute also violated state regulations by turning its 
evening school into a full-time school. 
  The circular criticizes the aforementioned units for their 
violations. In the circular, the SEC requested the Hunan 
Provincial Education Commission and the Henyang City People's 
Government to investigate the responsibility of -- and severely 
punish -- officials of the Henyang City Education Commission for 
giving the go-ahead to the "commissioned college level medical 
course" in violation of state regulations as well as those 
involved in illegally conducting the courses and enrolling 
students. The SEC instructed the Henyang City Education 
Commission, Public Health Bureau, and other units involved to 
abolish the "commissioned college level medical course" and 
properly deal with problems arising from the incident. 
  The "Letter on Suggestions for Dealing With the `Shaoyang 
Institute of Village and Town Enterprises in Hunan Province,'" 
which was reissued by the SEC, notes that in July 1992 the 
Shaoyang city people's government, in Hunan Province, approved 
without authorization the establishment of the "Shaoyang 
Institute of Village and Town Enterprises in Hunan Province" and 
took it upon itself to register applicants, compile 
examinations, administer tests, and enroll students. It 
admitted 106 students in 1992 and 141 in 1993. The Hunan 
provincial people's government took the matter seriously and 
instructed the provincial education commission to investigate. 
After a thorough investigation, the provincial education 
commission took a firm step to redress Shaoyang city's blunder 
by abolishing the institute. 
  The SEC pointed out: Higher education has developed rapidly 
in China over the years. Infractions of discipline and 
transgressions of authority, however, have been reported 
frequently in regard to the establishment, name changes, and 
enrollment of institutes of higher learning. Driven by the 
profit motive, some units, schools, or individuals are taking 
advantage of people's admirable desire to obtain a higher 
education -- in violation of specific prohibitions and repeated 
injunctions and in undermining state plans -- by offering 
college-level courses and recruiting at will students who have 
failed to pass college entrance examinations, youths awaiting 
job assignments, and currently employed workers from society at 
large. Some of these educational establishments do not have any 
facilities or teaching staff of their own. They hold courses by 
renting primary or middle school classrooms or floor space from 
factories or hotels and by scraping together a teaching staff. 
Even though some courses are given at secondary or other 
schools, these schools lack the facilities, teaching staff, and 
administrative support needed to carry out higher education. 
  The circular notes: The frequent recurrence of incidents 
involving illegal student enrollments, illegal courses, and 
illegal diplomas can be attributed to the leaderships of a few 
localities' departments who either did not understand the 
gravity and the possible serious consequences of their actions, 
or who have failed to implement the relevant state policy or 
have even connived at or supported such actions. 
  The circular points out: Enrollment in 1994 at institutes of 
higher learning will start soon. It is hoped that localities 
and departments will, while further emancipating their minds and 
accelerating the pace of reform and opening up, step up the 
macroadministration of higher education, strictly observe state 
laws and regulations, thoroughly investigate any incident 
involving illegal schools, enrollment, or diplomas in their 
respective jurisdictions, and consolidate order in educational 
circles. Where severity justifies it, the unit or individual 
involved shall be criticized by circulating a notice or shall be 
given the pertinent administrative punishments. The individuals 
involved shall be called to account for any serious consequences 
arising therefrom.

  [Text] Beijing, February 12 (XINHUA) -- Beijing University, 
one of China's leading universities, has been putting emphasis 
on promoting young and middle-aged lecturers to the ranks of 
professor and associate professor. 
  Over the past five years, the university has named over 190 
professors and associate professors from among the young and 
middle-aged staff. 
  From 1992 to 1993, the university appointed 55 professors 
and 
47 associate professors, the youngest professor being only 28 
years old. 
  To improve teaching and research conditions for young and 
middle-aged professors and associate professors, the university 
adopted eight measures. They included giving academic 
allowances, Ph.D. degree allowances, a scientific research 
foundation for young experts, a publishing foundation, and an 
academic holiday system. 
  Recently, the university invested 2 million yuan in the 
salary fund to ensure the adoption of a new higher salary 
standard system formulated by the government. 
  It has used the money to set up "Jun'an -- Beijing 
University 
Scientist Prize" for the academicians of the Chinese Academy of 
Natural Sciences, and tutors for graduates pursuing a Ph.D. 
course. 
  The university has built six apartment buildings for the 
people engaged in post-doctoral researches. 
  The improvement of the teaching and living conditions has 
attracted some returned graduates from abroad. So far this 
university has 60 professors who returned from abroad after they 
completed their Ph.D. degree.

addition. The first version entitled "Chaired by Jiang Zemin" 
was published in the Political &amp; Social section of the 10 
February China DAILY REPORT, page 6] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Feb (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council sponsored a Spring Festival 
get-together for exchanging greetings at the Great Hall of the 
People this morning. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC 
Central Committee, state president, and chairman of the Central 
Military Commission, and Li Peng, State Council premier and 
Standing Committee member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau, extended New Year's greetings to everyone present, a 
happy new year to the people of all nationalities in the country 
and the compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, as well as 
Overseas Chinese, and cordial greetings to international friends 
who care for and support China's modernization drive. 
  The banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People was 
brightly 
lit and decorated with lanterns and colored streamers. Jiang 
Zemin, Li Peng, Hu Jintao, and other party and government 
leaders, responsible comrades of all central party, government, 
Army, and mass organizations; retired veteran comrades who have 
contributed to socialist revolution and construction, officials 
from the democratic parties and patriotic figures without party 
affiliation, foreign friends who have helped China's socialist 
construction, and representatives from all walks of life in the 
capital -- totaling some 4,000 people -- attended the 
get-together. They exchanged festive greetings and celebrated 
the new year with jubilation. 
  Jiang Zemin officiated over the get-together and Li Peng 
made 
a speech. [Li Peng's remarks were excerpted out of first version 
published in the 10 February DAILY REPORT] 
  Li Peng said: The year 1993 was one in which we implemented 
in an all-round way the 14th National Party Congress guidelines 
and triumphantly marched along the path of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. We have made important 
achievements in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. 
A new situation has emerged in all fields of work. 
  He pointed out: The year 1994 will be one in which the 
national economy will maintain its momentum of sound 
development. It will also be a year crucial to our efforts to 
push forward reform. We must take as our guide Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, implement in an 
all-round way the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress 
and Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure, maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy; safeguard political 
stability, and promote social progress in an all-round way. 
He said: The main tasks of reform this year are: 1) to 
effectively organize the implementation of major measures for 
fiscal, taxation, financial, investment, and other reforms, and 
to establish and improve the system of macroeconomic regulation 
and control; 2) to continuously change the operating mechanisms 
of state-owned enterprises and to seek effective ways to 
establish a modern enterprise system meeting the requirements of 
the socialist market economy; and 3) to appropriately advance 
price reform after giving full consideration to the tolerance of 
the different sectors of society, and to develop and perfect the 
market system. 
  Li Peng emphasized: Seizing the opportunity, deepening 
reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability are the overall interests of the work of this year. 
All fields of work must be subordinated to and serve these 
interests. We should promote the reform of the economic 
structure during the rapid growth of the national economy; at 
the same time, we should also maintain the steady growth of the 
national economy during the transformation of the economic 
structure. Therefore, we must conscientiously and properly 
handle the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability. We should uphold the principle of "grasping two 
links at the same time and putting stress on both links." While 
concentrating our efforts on economic reform and development, we 
should continue to do a good job in strengthening the building 
of the CPC, and we should vigorously strengthen the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization. We should develop socialist 
democracy, strengthen the legal system, deepen the 
anticorruption struggle, and effectively solve public-order 
problems in a comprehensive way to create a favorable 
environment for reform and development. 
  Li Peng said: Let us -- guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
led by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as 
the core -- unswervingly implement the party's basic line, 
strengthen the great unity among all nationalities in the whole 
country, be of one heart and one mind, wage hard struggle, and 
strive for new victories in socialist modernization! 
  Leading comrades who were present at the gathering were Ding 
Guangen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Yang Baibing, Zou Jiahua, Chen

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Culture Liu Zhongde by staff </F>
reporter Shen Weixing (3088 5898 2502); place and date not 
given: "Major Reform Will Be Made in Cultural Structure This 
Year"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Jan (GUANGMING RIBAO)--Liu Zhongde, 
minister of culture, was interviewed by a staff reporter today 
on the direction of the reform of the cultural structure in the 
new year. Liu Zhongde stressed the necessity of increasing the 
intensity of reform of the cultural structure and to open up a 
new situation for cultural undertakings. 
<H3>  A Year in Which More Measures Will Be Taken in Reform of the 
Cultural Structure and the Intensity of Reform Will Be Greater 
Than Any Other Year </H3>
  The reporter asked: "Is this year a year in which more 
reform measures will be taken by the Ministry of Culture and the 
intensity of reform will be greater than any other year?" Liu 
Zhongde gave an affirmative reply. He said: The year 1994 is a 
crucial year for the comprehensive advancement of and for making 
key breakthroughs in reform of the economic structure in our 
country. This has made speeding up and deepening reform of the 
cultural structure even more pressing. Speeding up and 
deepening reform of the cultural structure is not only to meet 
the needs of the overall situation of reform of the economic 
structure, but also to meet the needs of invigorating and 
developing socialist literary and art undertakings. If we say 
our work in the past year was to make necessary discussions and 
preparations for speeding up and deepening reform, this year 
should then be a year for making greater progress and obtaining 
considerable results in reform. 
  He explained with examples that the internal organizational 
reform of cultural organs should be completed this year. Such 
reform includes changes in the functions of government work. 
This means the mode of management which is suited to the 
planned economy structure of the past should be shifted to the 
mode of management which is suited to the market economy 
structure. The leadership of cultural work should gradually 
change the practice of regarding micro management as the 
dominant factor to the practice of regarding macro management as 
the dominant factor, should concentrate major efforts on giving 
guidance in direction, grasping general quantity and quality, 
structure, and results, and should learn and master the 
comprehensive use of economic, legal, and administrative means 
and public opinion to guide the healthy development of cultural 
undertakings. Besides, this year we should also complete the 
structural reform of cultural institutions. Arts institutes and 
schools directly under the Ministry of Culture, for example, 
have already finalized reform plans and have started 
implementing such plans. 
<H3>  Reform of Artistic Performance Organizations Is of Paramount 
Importance to Reform of the Cultural Structure </H3>
  When asked by the reporter the focus of the reform of the 
cultural structure this year, Minister Liu replied: It is the 
structural reform of performance organizations, including the 
structural reform of artistic institutions and troupes directly 
under the central authorities. Reform in this respect is of 
paramount importance to the entire reform of the cultural 
structure. 
  He said that in September last year, the Ministry of Culture 
issued a "Circular on Further Speeding Up and Deepening the 
Structural Reform of Artistic Performance Organizations," which 
put forward views on the reform of artistic performance 
organizations, including the general layout, the leadership and 
management structure, the personnel system, the wage system, the 
management in giving performances, and ideological and political 
work. This year, we want to advance reform in a big step 
forward and to earnestly make some achievements. 
  When the reporter asked Minister Liu to give details on the 
structural reform of organizations directly under the central 
authorities, he replied that we are concentrating our efforts on 
the reform of artistic institutions and troupes directly under 
the central authorities. This has been the key and difficult 
point in the reform of the literature and art structure for many 
years. At present, we are tackling substantive problems. We 
have specially grasped experiments on reform of the Central 
Philharmonic Orchestra, the Central Peking Opera Troupe, the 
Central Song and Dance Ensemble, and the Oriental and Song and 
Dance Ensemble. The leading group for the reform of artistic 
performance organizations directly under the central authorities 
set up last year has today put forward macro views on and key 
operational points for the present stage of the structural 
reform and they will be published after discussion and approval. 
  Here, the targeted mode of reform is to concentrate efforts 
on properly running troupes which represent the national 
artistic level, and, on the basis of making a scientific 
assessment, improving the structure and personnel and pulling 
together the strong points in terms of personnel, finance, and 
materials to make general and rational readjustments of the 
existing layout of institutions and troupes directly under the 
central authorities. 
  To be specific, we shall establish a performance mechanism 
with the help of the government and performance subsidies as the 
center and this will effectively put an end to the "big pot" way 
of distribution which makes no difference between those who work 
and those who do not work and between those who work well and 
those who do not. This will not be the same as what some people 
said: Reform is simply to increase the income of personnel who 
give performance; and without much money, people can eat from 
"the same big pot," and with much money, people can still eat 
from "the same big pot." The reform in the latter aspect is 
even more difficult. At present, some artistic organizations 
cannot continue to exist even if the planned economy structure 
remained unchanged, and much less can they keep abreast of the 
market economy structure. Regarding traditional, national, 
refined literary and art organizations which represent the 
national level, the state will focus its support on them through 
increasing state input and social sponsorship to enhance their 
improvement and development. In this respect, it is necessary 
to establish, through this reform, a long- term, steady, and 
reliable material guarantee channel and to thoroughly change the 
situation in which such organizations are like beggars and can 
give performance only when they have secured some money. 
  The concrete operation will also include the establishment 
of 
a personnel system which takes contract appointment as the 
center and the ministry will help solve the problem of where to 
go for various kinds of artistic personnel who are not employed, 
who are waiting for employment, or who have been dismissed after 
the sizes, posts, and personnel of institutions and troupes 
directly under the central authorities have been fixed. We 
shall adopt the method of dynamic separation centering round 
artistic production. To be specific, various institutions and 
troupes will organize the artistic creation and production of a 
number of plays and programs this year and in the course of 
making preparations for such plays and programs, it is necessary 
to boldly adopt a new management structure, sign contracts with 
those who are needed by the artistic production, put them in 
positions by appointment, and carry out dynamic separation in 
the course of artistic production. This shows that the 
intensity of reform here is quite great. However, it will 
totally get rid of the long-standing drawbacks of artistic 
institutions and troupes directly under the central authorities, 
be conducive to the establishment of a set of new and vigorous 
operational mechanism, bring about artistic vitality, increase 
the ability to compete in the market, set the institutions and 
troupes as examples, and give impetus to the reform of artistic 
performance organizations across the country. 
<H3>  The Spiritual Loss of Cultural Workers and the Decline in 
the Quality of Cultural Products Should Not be the Cost of Reform </H3>
  Liu Zhongde also mentioned that following the increase in 
intensity in the reform of cultural structure, the difficulty in 
reform will also increase correspondingly. We should not expect 
to accomplish the whole task at one stroke, but should advance 
in an orderly manner, step by step, and with emphasis on some 
points. We have just started the major task of establishing a 
cultural structure which is in keeping with the socialist market 
economy structure. Therefore, regarding the reform, we should 
not hesitate, but should tackle problems with a sense of 
undertaking a historical mission and properly carry out the 
reform. Only in this way is there hope for cultural 
undertaknigs. To accomplish this mission of the times, cultural 
cadres at all levels and the broad masses of literary and art 
workers should first of all have a good mental state and should 
be able to correctly handle contradictions between the 
individual and the collective, the individual and the 
undertaking, and the present and the future which they meet with 
in the course of reform. Without the mental state of forging 
ahead despite difficulty, it will be difficult to persist in 
reform. 
  Liu Zhongde pointed out that to test whether or not the 
reform of the cultural structure is successful, it is necessary 
to see whether or not the reform is conducive to three things, 
that is, to fully arousing and giving play to the enthusiasm and 
creativity of the broad masses of literary and art workers, to 
producing products and talented people, bringing about 
flourishing socialist cultural undertakings, and meeting the 
people's growing needs in cultural life, and to promoting 
economic development and comprehensive progress of the society. 
Therefore, this reform should bring about new development and a 
new situation in cultural undertakings instead of bring chaos to 
cultural work. The spiritual loss of cultural workers and the 
decline of the quality of cultural products should not be the 
cost of reform. This does not conform with the law of 
development of culture and art and we should pay attention to 
this question. The central authorities have attached great 
importance to, and shown great concern about, cultural work at 
present, including the reform of the cultural structure, 
exercised effective leadership, given effective guidance, 
implemented clear-cut policies and principles, and won the 
people's full support. Our work is precisely being carried out 
under such concrete guidance.

<F P=106> [By Li Feng (7812 1496): "Deng Xiaoping Praises the `50 </F>
Measures' Fixed By Third Plenary session of the Central 
Committee and Once Again Stresses the Need To Grasp the 
Opportune Moment for `Accelerating Development'"--passages 
within slantlines published in boldface] 
  [Text] The economic development was, indeed, not bad in 
mainland China last year, registering a 13.5 percent growth and 
reaching the highest level so far in the 1990's. During the 
second half of last year, monetary order was rectified, 
macroeconomic regulation and control was intensified, and the 
"Decisions on Several Issues Regarding the Establishment of a 
Socialist Market Economic Structure" (the "50 Measures") were 
adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee. These have exerted, and will continue to exert, a 
relatively positive impact on mainland China's economic 
development. In particular, the "50 Measures" adopted by the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee can be 
called a programmatic document for mainland China to eventually 
realize the transition from a planned to a market economy. 
  The outline of the basic ideas in this document was sketched 
out in 1988 when Zhao Ziyang was in power. Had it not been for 
the strong opposition from the conservative forces within and 
outside the party, and the backward forces in society at that 
time, against the mainland's economic structural reform, and the 
structural reform of prices in particular, these measures might 
have been introduced then and put into practice. It is a good 
thing that the work has begun after all, although it has been 
put off for four or five years. Moreover, judging from the 
systematic, comprehensive, and manipulative character of the 
document, the ideas in it are more mature than those in 1988; 
the fundamental tenets of the "market economy" have been more 
prominently stressed and defined. No doubt this marks a major 
historic advance in China. 
<H3>  Deng Xiaoping Spoke Highly of the Creativity of the 
Decisions Adopted at the Plenary Session </H3>
  Deng Xiaoping himself was very pleased at this. At the time 
when Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
was published in the middle of November last year, just before 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee was 
held, Deng Xiaoping particularly pointed out: "The 
general guiding principle of this book lies in my speeches made 
during the south China tour at the beginning of last year 
(1992), in which I expressed some ideas on how to understand 
socialism and how to build socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. There was something new in them and some 
improvements had been made. The document adopted at the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee coincides with 
the meanings of my abovementioned speeches. It contains some 
new expressions that are not mine. This is very good, for this 
is creativity and development. If an idea or a concept can be 
proved in practice and further elaborated and developed, then it 
will have vitality and win support from the people. If we 
persistently follow this road and discover the law, the overall 
situation will not be hampered no matter whether someone is 
still alive or not and whether someone is in power or not. When 
this law works, the general direction will not be changed. I am 
most happy about this." 
<H3>  Deng Xiaoping Places Hopes on Shanghai for Another Great 
Leap Forward </H3>
  Deng Xiaoping has been in high spirits recently. A short 
time ago, when accompanied by someone in his car driving along 
the Beijing Airport Expressway and the newly built Dongsanhuan 
Lu Bridge, he praised Beijing for "having a new atmosphere every 
year, which is very exciting." Recently, Deng went to Shanghai 
with his family for the Spring Festival there. Accompanied by 
his beloved daughter Mao Mao, he inspected the magnificent 
Yangpu Bridge on 13 December last year. Deng showed a 
special feeling for Shanghai when he said: "Shanghai is a place 
of blessing in China. People of our generation started a 
revolution in Shanghai at that time. Now, the development of 
China also needs another great leap forward that should start 
again from Shanghai. I have placed high hopes in Shanghai. 
Whether the work in Shanghai is well performed or not next year 
(1994) will have a bearing on the overall situation, so this 
step in the chess game must be made appropriately." 
<H5>  Deng Xiaoping Once Again Stresses Faster Development </H5>
  Deng Xiaoping also stressed recently: "I think the 
last few years of the 20th century will be very advantageous to 
China. Many developing countries and regions all have a history 
of sustained economic growth for two or three decades. Will 
China be able to do the same? I think it is full of hope. 
Counting from 1980, we have only developed for a dozen years 
now. The comprehensive national strength has been augmented 
because we have chosen a correct path and the international 
climate is also favorable. These are basic conditions. Of 
course, we also have quite a few knotty problems. However, when 
we advance rapidly, we have more ways of solving these problems. 
That is why I feel that we must not slow down in the next few 
years. We must solve our problems in the course of development 
and spur development in the course of reform. We need not 
listen to some people's arguments abroad because they do not 
want to see a powerful China. They have failed to boost their 
economies, which has precisely offered us an opportunity. All 
countries are advancing and there is competition among them. 
Hence, we will suffer losses if the opportunity is seized by 
others. The problems with which China is now faced include a 
large population, the still unsteady position of agriculture as 
a foundation, and the still poor performance of most state-owned 
enterprises, which we must not treat lightly. We must take firm 
hold of these important matters which have a bearing on the 
overall situation and strive to make some new changes every 
year. In short, I am full of confidence." 
<H5>  Is a Growth Rate of 9 Percent Appropriate? </H5>
  Will the mainland's economy continue to grow at the same 
high 
rate as last year? Will the economic structural reform which is 
being carried out on a large scale, go on smoothly? Everyone is 
following these two major issues with interest. In analyzing 
these issues, we may find the following phenomena worthy of 
further exploration. 
  The problem of inflation. By October last year, 
the mainland's retail price index had risen by 14.5 percent, the 
index of residents' living expenses in 35 large and medium 
cities had risen by 20.1 percent, and the prices of daily 
necessities and labor services had increased by even larger 
margins. This year, as the prices of key industries and 
products such as petroleum oil, coal, communications, 
electricity, and so on will be raised successively, they will 
certainly bring about price rises in consumer goods and the 
agricultural means of production. As control on grain prices 
has been lifted and the price scissors of industrial and 
agricultural products has been gradually narrowed, the prices of 
essential consumer goods for daily life, such as grain, meat, 
poultry, eggs, vegetables, among other things will also rise 
substantially. Last September, the mainland's credit again 
showed an excessively rapid growth rate when the government 
injected credit funds into the economy to alleviate the problem 
of insolvency with which enterprises were universally 
confronted. The domestic credit, was increased on the mainland 
by a total of 199.5 billion yuan in the first nine months of 
last year. Of this, the September increase alone was 53.3 
billion yuan with the growth rate reaching 26.7 percent. Among 
these increased credits, nearly three-quarters were used to meet 
enterprises' demands for circulating funds. In October, the 
government once again injected approximately 80 billion yuan as 
credit funds to satisfy the requirements for circulating funds. 
The credit growth contributed to the growth in money supply. As 
mainland economists pointed out, the experience of inflation in 
1988 has proved that the growth in money supply has a notable 
impact on inflation and inflation comes after a growth in money 
supply. Therefore, the inflation triggered by the mainland money 
supply due to credit growth will be reflected on a large scale 
around March this year. By that time, the economic life on the 
mainland will very probably be in the situation where the 
economy will operate very rapidly as it did last June and, at 
the same time, inflation will pick up sharply. This will 
certainly bring about a rather unfavorable impact on the 
mainland's large-scale economic structural reform and its 
efforts to seek rapid economic development this year. When 
inflation reaches the limit of social and people's tolerance, it 
will inevitably give rise to social disturbances, about which 
the CPC hierarchy has been much worried. This is a matter to 
which people cannot help but pay special attention. 
  It is said that there are different views in economic 
circles 
on the question of how rapidly the economy should grow this 
year. Even though the CPC hierarchy has recently determined 
that the economy should grow at 9 percent this year, some 
mainland economists still maintain that 7 to 8 percent will be 
more suitable because, if the monetary policy is relaxed too 
early, the positive results yielded by the measures taken since 
last July to rectify monetary order, intensify macroeconomic 
regulation and control, stabilize the economy, check inflation, 
and so on may be disrupted and high inflation may emerge again. 
This means that still more stringent measures must be adopted 
in the future to restore monetary order and stabilize the 
economy, so that the national economy will not once again fall 
into a vicious cycle of big ups and downs. Moreover, the rapid 
economic growth propped up by increased money supply will only 
retard the change from the old structure to the new and lead to 
a massive waste of natural resources and a confused condition in 
the economic sphere. 
  However, there is very strong pressure from the governments 
of various localities on the mainland. They are calling for 
rapid growth and for the central authorities to ease credits and 
enlarge the scope of input and those advocating accelerating 
both reform and development simultaneously have got the upper 
hand. Under these circumstances, the CPC hierarchy has won the 
support and confidence of governments in various localities and 
is willing to adopt a compliant attitude in exchange for their 
recognition of the central authority. In addition, Deng 
Xiaoping's recently repeated emphasis on a faster growth is also 
a principle that the CPC hierarchy should follow in determining 
this year's growth rate. At present, as regards the policy of 
tightening currency, the CPC hierarchy has tried its best to 
avoid some expressions which have been used since last July. 
This signifies that it has put more stress on the policy idea 
of an "accelerated development." Perhaps after March or April 
this year, there will be some indications concerning the actual 
effect that this policy tendency will produce. The mainland's 
economic circles predict that if this year's credit and money 
placement are arranged in line with the growth rate of 9 
percent, the "policy of tightening up money supply" may be 
abandoned and inflation will continue to pick up. The soaring 
prices of consumer goods in various large cities on the mainland 
a short time ago were a signal of that. 
<H5>  Agriculture Faces Two Major Tough Problems </H5>
  The problems in agriculture. The problem of 
"issuing IOU notes" which emerged universally in rural areas in 
1992, has hurt peasants and encroached on their interests. Last 
year, the CPC hierarchy adopted some measures and reaped certain 
positive results. However, the rapid industrial growth and the 
chaotic monetary order on the mainland last year caused a 
substantial amount of funds to transfer from agriculture to 
nonagriculture, so that "intensifying the position of 
agriculture as a foundation" became "empty talk" to a 
considerable extent. Last year, the output of several major 
agricultural products was lower than in 1992 and the condition 
that agricultural growth was not coordinated with industrial 
growth further deteriorated. Hence, insufficient supplies of 
agricultural products will be fully exposed this year. 
  Today, there are two major problems which face agriculture. 
One is that peasants' income has been continuously declining 
over the past few years and the sustained growth of peasants' 
income of the early 1980's no longer exists. High inflation, 
high production costs, large amounts of fundraising, and large 
amounts of apportionment have become onerous burdens which the 
peasants are unable to bear and the reduction of agricultural 
income has dampened peasants' enthusiasm in farming, year after 
year. The mainland's economic reform started from the rural 
areas but the reform measures which have been introduced since 
the late 1980's have not brought many substantive benefits to 
the peasants or to the rural economy. While the market economy 
is eliminating backward rural production modes, peasants have 
not generally benefited from this and their participation in the 
large-scale socialized production system will inevitably cause a 
considerable number of them to pay the price of becoming 
relatively poor. As peasants on the mainland number 800 
million, any proportion of them being reduced to poverty will 
bring a powerful onslaught on social, political, and economic 
lives throughout the country. Therefore, in the reform process 
to establish a market economy, how to diminish this degree of 
poverty in the best possible way and enable the vast numbers of 
peasants to gradually adapt themselves to the requirements of 
the economic transformation and universally benefit from the 
reform, is a very tough problem. Due to the constant decline in 
their income over the past few years, peasants have not been as 
"temperate, kind, courteous, and obedient" as they once were. 
Since last year, several dozen incidents of violent protest 
have occurred in various rural areas. In some areas, such as 
Renshou County in Sichuan Province, the peasants' protest was 
staged on a very large scale. These phenomena merit the CPC 
hierarchy's serious attention. 
  Another major problem in agriculture is the outlet for a 
large number of surplus laborers. According to a survey, the 
surplus labor power in rural areas now numbers approximately 110 
million, about 80 percent of whom have quit the rural areas and 
formed an enormous "floating population" moving here and there 
all over the country. As viewed from a positive angle, this 
huge "floating population" has provided the economic growth in 
the developed regions with affluent resources of labor power. 
Taken from a negative angle, however, the "floating population" 
has exerted great pressure on maintaining social order and 
stability. According to the economic development level on the 
mainland at present, only 30 to 40 percent of the rural surplus 
labor power can find jobs (including those absorbed by township 
and town enterprises). The rest of them mostly do not have a 
way out. Today, it is a general phenomenon in rural areas that 
only the old, underaged, weak, and female residents remain in 
the fields, while the able and strong laborers are unwilling to 
do farm work. How can this situation not cripple agriculture as 
a foundation? In this connection, many economists have reminded 
the CPC hierarchy of the necessity to seriously handle the 
agricultural problem and to introduce policies and measures like 
those in the 1980's to effect a major breakthrough in the 1990's 
so as to reverse the increasingly backward agricultural 
conditions in China. 
<H3>  Reasons Why the Campaign Against Corruption Cannot Be 
Carried Out Thoroughly </H3>
  The corruption issue. In a bid to overcome the 
constantly spreading corrupt phenomena among government 
officials, the CPC hierarchy has made a series of arrangements 
and adopted a number of measures since last August; the 
understanding of the corruption problem has been deepened and 
considerably greater attention has been paid to it, in attitude 
at least, because the hierarchy does not feel as shy or that it 
is necessary to cover it up now as it did before. But, what are 
the actual results? More than six months have passed and it 
should be admitted that there is still a big gap between the 
achievements and the expectations of the people at the beginning 
of the campaign. Many "major and serious" cases of corruption, 
which have been exposed and brought to light, could not be 
handled smoothly and had to be laid aside, to say nothing of 
those that have been covered up, evaded, or ignored. 
  There are two basic systems responsible for handling the 
corrupt cases--the public security organs, procuratorial organs, 
and people's courts outside the party; and the departments for 
discipline inspection within the party. The way of handling 
cases by both systems is of a closed nature, with different 
criteria and methods, but with identical practice--details may 
or may not be made public to the people in society. Both 
systems work "under the unified leadership of the party" and the 
views of party committees have the functions of "final 
adjudication." It is very difficult to guarantee the fair and 
legal handling of the corrupt problems in this way. In 
addition, the CPC's basic consideration for handling the corrupt 
problems is "stability." It will only act if things are 
beneficial to stability so it cannot really "act in accordance 
with the law." 
  Moreover, the mainland's current economic structure is a 
"mixture" of power economy plus market economy. The rationality 
and irrationality of bartering money for power are mutually 
complementary and can be proved using two different rules, 
hence, it is not so easy to determine which is legal and which 
is illegal. It has been reported that there was also such a 
problem in handling the swindling case of the "Great Wall 
Machinery and Electrical Appliances," which was ferreted out 
last June. Some senior officials involved in the case were able 
to prove that their conduct was "legal" by invoking relevant 
legal provisions, while they were proved "guilty" according to 
relevant policies and stipulations promulgated within the party. 
The "two contradictory laws" have deferred the handling of the 
case even after stalling for a long time. That is why relevant 
personalities in legal circles, who were acquainted with the 
details of the case, pointed out that the conflict between 
"policy" and "law" is an inevitable product in countries ruled 
by a single party. Under the conditions that the party alone 
has been in power for a long time, the ruling party need not and 
cannot formulate laws which it has an obligation to abide by and 
comply with. Its basic point of departure in formulating laws 
is to safeguard the ruling position of the party. When the 
general applicability of the laws affects its ruling interests, 
the laws must make way for its policies. The existing Chinese 
Constitution makes definite stipulations on "upholding the four 
cardinal principles," the first principle of which is to "uphold 
the CPC's leadership." This stipulation is binding on various 
social strata but it is only a "safeguarding force" rather than 
a binding force on the CPC itself. In this regard, as viewed 
from the angle of "binding," the whole Constitution has no 
effect on the CPC--the only party in power and no political 
forces in the entire mainland society can supervise and 
standardize the CPC's political conduct with this Constitution. 
Perhaps this is a fundamental reason that the CPC is unable to 
depend on laws to overcome its own corrupt phenomena. 
  This year, the CPC will carry out large-scale reform in the 
economic area. One of its main ideas is to change the "dual" 
structure of "power plus market." Originally, this can be 
regarded as a fundamental measure to stop officials from seeking 
economic interests by abuse of powers. However, people are in 
doubt--to what extent will government officials at various 
levels, who have gained enormous interests in the "dual" 
structure of "power plus market," support and welcome this kind 
of reform? In the change and transformation from a 
"double-track" structure to a "single-track" structure, how many 
illegal interests will be transformed into legal interests? 
These problems can constitute a major obstacle to the 
large-scale reform of the economic structure. A phenomenon 
which merits people's attention is thatthe ultra-leftist and 
conservative forces within the CPC are particularly active in 
the anticorruption campaign. However, it was precisely these 
people who reaped exorbitant profits in the "double-track 
system." This group of people could not accept the market 
economy but they would accept the economy of "power plus 
market." One of their principal objectives in performing 
actively in the anticorruption campaign was to safeguard the 
"power plus market" economic structure because, by so doing, 
they could have the grounds for maintaining their "planned 
control" over the economic life and, simultaneously, have the 
means for seeking personal benefits from the market. They took 
advantage of the anticorruption campaign to prove that the CPC 
was capable of exercising self-discipline to work honestly, so 
they must wield the power of direct intervention in the economic 
life. Such political intentions of the CPC's ultra-leftist and 
conservative forces should be detected and exposed to prevent 
them from turning the anticorruption campaign into an antireform 
political action. 
<H5>  Stability Can Hardly Be Effected by Exercising Control </H5>
  The stability issue. To the CPC hierarchy, the 
maintenance of political stability is a matter of paramount 
importance. The CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing 
Committee specially held an enlarged meeting at the end of last 
year to discuss this issue and make decisions. The meeting 
stressed that the first task of maintaining stability is to 
"resolutely suppress and crack down on various kinds of 
antirevolutionary activities conducted by the antagonistic 
forces at home and abroad and particular attention should be 
paid to cracking down on those organized political opposition 
activities." Another task is to effectively grasp and ontrol 
the press, cultural, and propaganda departments, to stress the 
"theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 
party's basic line, and the themes of patriotism, collectivism, 
socialism, and traditional virtues of the Chinese nation," and 
to ban the words and deeds regarding bourgeois liberalization, 
extreme individualism, hedonism, and money worship from 
appearing in any form in news reporting and propaganda material. 
According to this strategy, relevant departments have adopted 
tight and stringent measures to control political, cultural, 
press, propaganda, and other areas. The censorship in films, 
press, and publication has been intensified, and almost every 
month the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department issues 
directives that articles concerning such and such films, 
performers, news themes, books, periodicals, and authors "must 
not be reported and propagated," or "must be criticized," or 
"must be ordered to suspend publication and make self 
examination." The Central Propaganda Department also stipulated 
that various major newspapers, broadcasting stations, and 
television stations at the central level "must submit their 
plans for news reporting and theme selection" and "must refrain 
from presumptuously publishing reports not included for 
selection" on a regular basis. Personalities from mainland 
press and cultural circles have a common feeling: "The control 
of press and culture at present is nearly the same as that 
during the decade of the `Cultural Revolution.'" Today, press 
and publications are flooded with illogical, undemonstrable, and 
unconvincing reports and articles which are simply dull 
preaching full of outmoded ideology. The people's voices, 
thoughts, and views are nowhere to be heard or seen and there 
are terribly few articles with insight and of good quality which 
can help people understand important international and domestic 
events. In short, there are no academic contentions, free 
discussions, criticism on work errors of government officials, 
or news reports which the masses wish to know in the press. 
However, such an inanimate and lifeless atmosphere of 
propaganda and public opinion is eulogized as the "press opinion 
exercising leadership over social opinion and being higher than 
social opinion." 
  Relevant departments maintain that only by strictly 
controlling political, cultural, press, and other areas can 
political and social stability be guaranteed on the mainland. 
They do not understand that the multiple public interests, the 
diversified social life, and the wider openness brought by the 
mainland's economic structural reform can no longer be accepted 
and controlled by centralized politics and "unified opinion." A 
major contradiction, brought about by the authorities in pushing 
forward the economic structural reform through the traditional 
political structure and opinion control mode, has blocked and 
cut off the channels and bridges of exchange and linkage that 
promote the understanding between the officials and the ordinary 
people, so that the ability of the ruling party and government 
to respond to social changes and demands has become less 
flexible and they are unable to obtain understanding and support 
from the people when the economic reform meets with difficulties 
and obstacles. What is more, social contradictions will be 
sharpened and social unrest will be triggered off. The 4 June 
incident in 1989 did not occur because the political structural 
reform took the lead and the CPC's authority declined but 
because the reform lagged behind and even retrogressed. In 
summing up lessons after the 4 June incident, someone from the 
CPC hierarchy maintained that bourgeois liberalization had 
crippled the CPC's leadership. Hence, only by opposing 
"liberalization" can the CPC's ruling position be solidified. 
Since the coup d'etat in the Soviet Union on 19 August 1991, 
the CPC hierarchy, led by Deng Xiaoping, has acquired a new 
understanding of the above conclusion and believes that "China 
will come to a blind alley unless it persists in reform and 
opening up." Afterward, it came to realize the "necessity to 
maintain vigilance against the right tendencies but primarily 
guarding against the "left" tendencies because the latter is 
also a major cause of weakening the ruling position of the 
Communist Party. However, this understanding only remains in 
stressing the "need to further carry out economic structural 
reform" and the CPC, by and large, sticks to the previous 
traditional concept with regard to the political structural 
reform. This is shown in the wording about the political 
structural reform written in the "Decisions" adopted at the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 
<H5>  Constructive Remarks of Mainland People of Insight </H5>
  Mainland people of insight point out: The general mood of 
the authorities has fallen into an erroneous sphere. On the 
mainland, the broad masses' support given to the CPC has, on the 
whole, not been changed (given the numerous complaints and 
dissatisfaction) because the people are clear that the CPC has 
performed meritorious deeds over the past few years, as they 
have benefited from reform and opening up. There are no other 
political forces in China that are able and qualified to replace 
the CPC. The CPC should have confidence in this. However, the 
CPC should also understand that it should not just rely on 
unflinchingly pushing forward the economic reform to enhance and 
consolidate its ruling position but should also rely on 
unflinchingly pushing forward the political reform, as this is a 
basic condition to ensure that the people will make concerted 
efforts with the ruling party to maintain basic social 
stability. To have a democratic political advantage is more 
conducive to maintaining the CPC's ruling position and the 
stability of the country than to have its "traditional political 
advantage." The establishment of a democratic political 
structure is also of great benefit to the ruling party in 
developing and fostering new political resources for use by 
itself. The people's expression of support for and 
participation in the political activities of the ruling party 
through various forms of democratic politics will have a greater 
political cohesiveness than the mere instillation of the 
"loyalty awareness" into the people. It is hoped that the CPC 
hierarchy will give careful consideration to these constructive 
remarks.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Shu Huaide, director of the </F>
Office of the Central Committee for the Comprehensive Management 
of Public Security, by staff reporter Zhao Haibo (6392 3189 
3134); place and date not given: "Talking About Long-Term 
Stability at the Beginning of the New Year" -- first paragraph 
is BAN YUE TAN introduction] 
  [Text] The towering and grand economic mansion was built on 
the social foundations of national prosperity and public order. 
The year 1994 is very important and crucial for our country's 
efforts to deepen reform. The introduction of successive major 
reform measures, such as those designed to establish a market 
system and a macroeconomic regulatory and control system, will 
lead to some new contradictions and problems. How do we guard 
against danger while living in peace and take precautions to 
maintain a stable public order? At the beginning of the new 
year, this reporter interviewed Shu Huaide, secretary general of 
the Central Commission on Politics and Law and director of the 
Office of the Central Committee for the Comprehensive Management 
of Public Security [CCCMPS]. 
  [Zhao Haibo] Public order is currently one of the topics of 
great concern to the people. The central authorities have 
always considered this issue important and have tried to solve 
it by every possible means. Would you please discuss the 
situation in this respect? 
  [Shu Huaide] Generally speaking, our country enjoys a stable 
public order. This is primarily determined by nationwide 
political stability and economic development. However, it 
cannot be separated from the attention devoted to the 
comprehensive management of public security by the party Central 
Committee, the State Council, and party committees and 
governments at all levels. As pointed out by a leading central 
comrade last July, "public order problems could have been more 
serious had we not made relentless efforts to manage public 
security comprehensively." 
  To be sure, we cannot be optimistic about the current state 
of public order. Public order in some areas is indeed very bad. 
For instance, robberies are on the increase, highway and 
railway bandits are running wild, hooligans and evil forces in 
some villages and small towns are running rampant in their 
neighborhoods and are riding roughshod over the people, illegal 
criminal activities such as plundering and stealing state assets 
are increasing in oil fields, in mining areas, and along traffic 
routes; and social ills such as prostitution, patronizing 
prostitutes, drug abuse, and gambling persist despite repeated 
efforts to ban them. In light of these salient public order 
problems, the CCCMPS successively arranged four special 
struggles against "theft," "highway and railway bandits," 
"prostitution and patronizing prostitutes," and the "abduction 
and sale of women and children." These struggles have yielded 
results for the time being thanks to the vigorous support of 
leaders of party committees and governments at all levels and 
the broad masses of the people. Specifically, the struggle 
against highway and railway bandits launched nationwide since 
last March has produced remarkable results, thereby winning 
favorable comment from all sectors of society and from the 
people. 
  [Zhao] It has become a common public understanding that 
public security should be managed comprehensively. 
Nevertheless, people in some areas often do not assume 
responsibility although they want a piece of the cake. How 
should we change this situation? 
  [Shu] The key lies in instituting a type of mechanism 
consisting of incentives and restraints by which the 
responsibility for maintaining political stability and public 
order will be genuinely devolved to all departments, units, and 
individuals. Last November, the CCCMPS, in conjunction with the 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the CPC Central 
Committee's Organization Department, the Ministry of Personnel, 
and the Ministry of Supervision, formulated "Several Provisions 
Regarding the Implementation of a Leadership Responsibility 
System for the Comprehensive Management of Public Security," 
which established, as one of the goals for leading party and 
government cadres at all levels during their tenures, the 
comprehensive management of public security to ensure safety in 
all quarters, and which specified this as a criterion for 
evaluating job performance and for deciding on promotions, 
rewards, and disciplinary actions. The CCCMPS recently jointly 
issued a document with the relevant central departments 
specifying that individuals named as advanced persons in the 
national drive for the comprehensive management of public 
security may enjoy treatment comparable to that of provincial- 
or ministerial-level model workers. As its next step, the 
CCCMPS plans to study and formulate laws and regulations 
governing the comprehensive management of public security in an 
attempt to define in legal form the responsibility of units and 
citizens for maintaining public order. 
  [Zhao] What are the key tasks in comprehensive management 
of public security in 1994? 
  [Shu] The gradual establishment of a socialist market 
economic system and the deepening of reform in the new year will 
lead to more complex conditions and heavier burdens in the arena 
of public order. We must further strengthen comprehensive 
management without slackening our efforts in the least. 
  While we have a great deal of work to do in 1994, we should 
focus on the following six tasks: 1) We should firmly implement 
the leadership responsibility system for comprehensive 
management of public security, further heighten the sense of 
political responsibility for "ensuring safety in all quarters" 
among party and government leaders at all levels as well as 
among all relevant departments, and strengthen the concept of 
duty among cadres and people which says "maintaining public 
order is the duty of everybody." 2) We should continue our 
focused management approach. We should take account of reality, 
pay full heed to popular demands, and focus on improving 
outstanding public order problems and on areas where public 
order is bad. For instance, in the cities we should first 
improve chaotic public order in places where the public mingles 
haphazardly -- such as train stations, wharves, cultural and 
recreational facilities, and large country fairs. We should 
focus on battling illegal criminal activities which disrupt 
public order -- such as theft, robbery, prostitution, patronage 
of prostitutes, the dissemination of obscene articles, and 
market manipulation. 3) We should work hard to solve public 
order problems in rural areas, relentlessly fight against 
various hooligans and evil forces, further strengthen primary 
party and government organizations, and solidify mass prevention 
and management teams. 4) We should strengthen education of the 
legal system among young people, especially among middle-school 
students. 5) We should resettle, assist, and educate people who 
are released upon completing their prison terms or who are 
discharged from education through labor programs. We should 
marshal resources in all sectors of society to create broad 
avenues of employment, and should implement responsibility 
systems and measures for providing assistance and education. 6) 
We should intensify efforts to publicize the need for 
comprehensive management of public security, and should 
galvanize more cadres, workers, staff members, and people into 
conscientiously participating in comprehensive management. 
  Comprehensive management of public security is the 
fundamental solution to our country's public order problems, and 
it will play an increasingly important role in maintaining 
political stability and public order. I am confident it is 
entirely possible to foster long-term social stability in our 
country if we firmly implement various measures of 
comprehensively managing public security and if we maintain the 
current favorable state of political and social stability under 
the guidance of the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee and the direct leadership of the 
party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhou Qing (0719 1987) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Qu Zhihong (2575 1807 4767)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- The main topic of a 
national telephone conference on antipornography work held here 
today was earnestly implementing the guidelines of the 
conference on propaganda and ideological work convened by the 
party central committee, and continuing to campaign against 
pornography in a thorough and sustained way in order to create a 
good social and cultural environment for reform, opening up, and 
economic construction. 
  According to the telephone conference, marked progress was 
achieved in antipornography work last year thanks to leaders of 
various localities who personally attended to the work. In 
addition to deploying concentrated forces according to 
requirements set by the central committee, many provinces and 
cities also made corresponding arrangements to deal with book, 
newspaper, magazine, video, and audio product markets in their 
areas. Antipornography work last year focused attention on key 
areas and important links. As a result, breakthroughs were made 
in the investigation and handling of major cases involving the 
manufacture and sale of pornography, and a number of criminals 
were dealt with. According to incomplete statistics, in 1993 
the country confiscated 332.18 million copies of banned books 
and publications, of which 288,000 were pornographic; 499,700 
banned videotapes, of which 11,300 were pornographic; destroyed 
170 pornography-manufacturing and retail bases, including some 
illegal publishing houses; investigated and handled 1,675 cases 
involving the manufacture and sale of pornography and illegal 
publishing activities; and investigated and punished 5,991 
offenders. The conference noted: Despite the marked 
achievements made in antipornography work throughout the 
country, we must be fully aware of the chaotic condition of the 
publication market and realize everyone shoulders heavy 
responsibility in the struggle to combat pornography. 
  The conference analyzed the reasons for the resurgence of 
the 
"poison of pornography." It also mapped out a specific plan to 
deal with antipornography work in 1994 in accordance with 
requirements set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee. The conference called on all localities to 
further promote understanding of antipornography work among 
cadres and the masses, to unify their thinking with Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and to make unremitting efforts to grasp the 
work. The conference said: We must continue to make the 
handling of major cases the priority in antipornography work. 
In 1994 we must focus on raising the number of cases handled. 
It is also necessary to further enact and improve relevant laws 
and administrative regulations to manage book, newspaper, 
publication, audio, and video product markets according to the 
law. 
  The conference was presided ver by Yu Youxian, deputy head 
of 
the National Leading Group for the Rectification of Book, 
Newspaper, Publication, Audio, and Video Product Markets. Liu 
Zhongde delivered a speech and Gui Xiaofeng presented a work 
report to the conference. Responsible people from various 
departments under the central committee also took part in the 
telephone conference.

  [Text] Liu Huaqing, member of the Political Bureau's 
Standing Committee and vice chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, is currently spending the Spring Festival with the 
masses in Fujian. Yesterday he listened to a work report by Jia 
Qinglin, secretary of the Fujian Provincial CPC Committee and 
governor of the province. Liu Quaqing expressed his satisfaction 
with Fujian's achievements in recent years. He encouraged 
Fujian to further implement the instructions of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and to do 
better in all aspects of work under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  After listening to Jia Qinglin's briefing that Fujian had 
quadrupled its GNP seven years ahead of schedule, Comrade Liu 
Huaqing happily said: I have not been to Fujian for 10 years. 
There have been really great changes in Fujian, and its 
development is very fast. This is very good. He added: 
Economic development should remain at an appropriate rate; it 
should neither be too slow nor too fast. In particular, the 
scale of capital construction should not be too large and 
investment should not be too excessive. 
  He asked Jia Qinglin about commodity prices in the market. 
After learning that commodity prices were stable, he said: 
This is very good. Commodity prices involve the interests of 
tens of thousands of families. This is a major issue and should 
be resolved properly. Agriculture and grain are also important 
issues involving social stability and the country's tranquility. 
We should not relax our efforts on these issues. 
  On relations with Taiwan, he said: Apart from strengthening 
civilian, economic, and technological exchanges with Taiwan, it 
is all the more important for Fujian to speed up its economic 
development. This is very important to speeding up 
reunification. 
  Liu Huaqing continued: Fujian is rich in tourism resources. 
It should make great efforts to speedily develop its tourism to 
promote the development of other tertiary industries. 
  After listening to Jia Qinglin's report, Comrade Liu Huaqing 
thanked the Fujian Provincial Party Committee for supporting the 
armed forces. He requested the armed forces to support local 
construction so that the relations between the armed forces and 
civilians will become closer. 
  Comrade Liu Huaqing particularly stressed the need for the 
militia to display their exemplary role in the new period. He 
said: In the new situation, apart from being able to use guns, 
the militia should, more importantly, display their exemplary 
role in cultivating a good mood in society and in carrying out 
spiritual civilization.

Chen Yilin (7115 0076 2651)] 
  [Text] Fuzhou, 13 Feb (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, member of 
the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, 
inspected work in Fujian Province from 8 to 13 February. He 
also called on officers and soldiers stationed there. 
  During the Spring Festival holidays, Liu Huaqing, braving 
drizzling rain, extended regards to workers at the Dongdu Dock 
worksite and its second-phase project and at the Customs joint 
inspection house in Xiamen, conveying to them and the people of 
Xiamen the cordial solicitude of the party Central Committee, 
the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. On 11 
Feburary, after hearing a work report by Jia Qinglin, secretary 
of the Fujian provincial party committee and governor of Fujian, 
Liu Huaqing said: By implementing in-depth Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, implementing the 
guidelines of 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as the 
Central Committee's series of major decisions, persisting in 
making economic construction the central task, and adopting 
effective measures, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and 
the provincial government have brought about a sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development of Fujian's economy, quadrupling the 
province's gross product seven years ahead of schedule. Liu 
Huaqing said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee has issued the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee 
on Some Issues Concerning the Establish of a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure." Therefore, leaders at all levels should 
become acquainted with new situations, study new issues, learn 
new knowledge, persist in simultaneously building material and 
spititual civilizations, handle well the relationship between 
overall interest and partial interest, and concentrate their 
efforts to accelerate economic development. He said: Since 
Fujian and Taiwan are separated by only a strip of water, the 
two sides should enhance their nongovernmental exchanges and 
strengthen their economic and technological cooperation. People 
on both sides of the strait will be happy if our economies 
become strong and powerful. 
  During his stay in Fujian, Liu Huaqing, accompanied by 
Nanjing Military Region Commander Gu Hui, called on the officers 
and soldiers stationed in Xiamen, encouraging them to preserve 
and carry forward the traditions of the Red Army in the new 
situation and to strengthen army building in accordance with the 
general requirments -- all army units must be qualified 
politically and competent militarily. They must have a fine 
style of work, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of 
adequate logistical support -- as put forward by Central 
Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin. 
  Liu Huaqing called on basic-level officers and soldiers of a 
group army on 13 February. He said: The People's Liberation 
Army bears the historic mission of protecting and building the 
country. At no time and under no circumstances should it forget 
this sacred duty and function. In the new situation of reform, 
opening up, and establishing a socialist market economy, 
officers and soldiers of the whole army must work hard, be 
selflessly dedicated, and subjugate personal interests to 
collective interests. Partial interests must be subjugated to 
overall interests and army building must be subjugated to the 
overall interests of national economic construction. 
  He said: China's cause of liberation was achieved with the 
blood of tens of thousands of revolutionary martyrs. The 
establishment of New China has not been easy. It is because of 
the hard work of a few generations of people that it has 
developed to this day. Every generation should cherish our 
present-day achievements. Every soldier must contribute to the 
country's political stability and economic development. 
  Liu Huaqing stressed: The key to improving army building 
lies in cadres. Party committees and leaders at all levels must 
keep constant tabs on their work of training cadres, enforce 
management and requirements strictly, and strengthen education 
and studies; they should bring into full play the subjective 
initiative of cadres at all levels as well as the role of 
veteran comrades in passing on experiences, giving help, and 
setting an example in training new cadres, and follow the method 
of letting higher-level units guide and educate lower-level 
units. Leaders at all levels must show sincere concern for the 
weal and woe of soldiers, solve practical problems of 
basic-level officers and soldiers, and guarantee that the 
working, living, and recreational conditions for basic-level 
cadres and soldiers are good in order to ensure that the masses 
of officers and soldiers will be content with their jobs at 
basic units in the army and continue to make contributions to 
the country.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Deng Ying (6772 4481) and Central </F>
People's Radio Network reporter Zhang Yusheng (1728 7183 3932)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- The third national work 
conference on frontier defense that ended today demanded 
national frontier defense under the new period to take serving 
the state economic construction as its center; to actively 
develop good-neighborly relations with neighboring countries; 
and to vigorously promote economic development, prosperity, and 
stability along the border areas to ensure a smooth 
implementation of reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  In his work report to the current meeting on frontier 
defense 
that began 1 February, State Councillor Luo Gan, who is also 
secretary general of the State Council and chairman of the 
National Frontier Defense Committee, pointed out: Since the 
last meeting in 1979, China has achieved remarkable success in 
work related to frontier defense, thanks to the conscientious 
discharge of such duties as consolidating frontier defense, 
promoting good-neighborliness, bringing prosperity to the people 
along the borders through development, and maintaining stability 
that gradually put itself onto a track of peacetime development 
and management and helped create a peaceful and tranquil 
environment for reform and opening up. On the basis of 
upholding the five principles of peaceful coexistence, China has 
normalized relations with all its neighboring countries, thus 
creating the best ever surrounding environment since the 
founding of the nation, which brought economic construction 
along the frontiers, particularly the rapid development of 
border trade. Army-government and army-people relations as well 
as solidarity among the various nationalities along the borders 
have been further consolidated and strengthened. The 
army-police-people joint defense effort has turned out to be a 
good frontier defense format under the new situation. 
  After analyzing the development and changes in the internal 
and external situations and conditions along the borders, Luo 
Gan pointed out: Under the new historical period, China's 
frontier defense must be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; 
adhere to the party's basic line; conscientiously implement the 
principles and policies of the party's Central Committee, the 
State Council, and the Central Military Commission on frontier 
defense as well as the relevant state laws and regulations; 
resolutely safeguard state sovereignty and territorial 
integrity; preserve and develop good-neighborliness with 
neighboring countries; strengthen nationality solidarity; uphold 
reform and opening up; promote economic development along the 
border areas; maintain border security and stability; and create 
a fine surrounding environment conducive to the socialist 
modernization drive. Hence, it is necessary to firmly develop a 
consciousness on national security, territory, and sovereignty; 
actively promote cooperation and exchanges with neighboring 
countries in various forms and levels; energetically develop 
border trade; severely crack down on various criminal 
activities, including smuggling, drugs and firearms trafficking, 
and the sale of women; and maintain normal order along the 
border areas to ensure that reform, opening up, and economic 
construction are carried out in a peaceful, tranquil 
environment, both internally and externally. 
  The meeting demanded governments and frontier defense 
committees at various levels along the border areas to further 
adapt themselves to the needs of establishing a socialist market 
economic system by unifying ideological understanding and 
deepening reform. Besides, it is necessary to strengthen the 
legal aspect of frontier defense, speed up infrastructure 
construction, improve personnel quality, and strengthen 
organizational leadership to create conditions more favorable to 
strengthening frontier defense management. 
  Over 170 representatives from the frontier defense front 
attended the meeting, during which they exchanged experiences in 
frontier defense management, studied characteristics and 
missions of frontier defense under the new period, and discussed 
draft laws and regulations pertaining to frontier defense 
management.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 Jan (XINHUA) -- The People's Liberation 
Army [PLA] General Political Department [GPD] recently issued a 
circular to the entire army, asking the vast numbers of 
commanders and fighters to continue the in-depth activities to 
learn from Lei Feng in an effort to vigorously strengthen the 
troops' building of spiritual civilization. 
  The circular pointed out: The Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee set new demands on building a 
socialist market economic structure and socialist spiritual 
civilization. Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, has stressed on many occasions recently that the 
army should lead the rest of the nation in building spiritual 
civilization. All army units should earnestly implement the 
guidelines of the party Central Committee and Central Military 
Commission's instructions and raise to a new level the 
learn-from-Lei Feng activities and the building of spiritual 
civilization. 
  The circular says: In light of the new circumstances and 
problems in the new situation, all military units should 
organize officers and men to earnestly study the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to learn 
from Lei Feng's glorious deeds and lofty thinking. All military 
units should guide their officers and men to take Lei Feng as 
their model; hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism; 
uphold the communist outlook on life and communist values; carry 
forward the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Deng 
Xiaoping and the "64-character" pioneering spirits put forward 
by Jiang Zemin; regulate their words and deeds with such ethics 
and lofty spirits as self-sacrifice, putting others before 
oneself, working hard, observing law and discipline, loving the 
army, and improving military skills; and consciously resist the 
corrosive effects of money worship, ultra-individualism, and 
corrupt lifestyle. We must perpetuate traditional Chinese 
virtues and, on this basis, establish and develop military 
ethics and standards suitable to our army's character and traits 
so that the vast numbers of officers and men will have higher 
ideological consciousness and moral standards, better behavior, 
and higher scientific and technological and cultural standards 
and will work hard to become soldiers practicing and spreading 
new socialist ethics and styles. 
  The circular stresses: We must vigorously publicize and 
commend advanced models in learning from Lei Feng and building 
spiritual civilization. We must continue to bring into play the 
exemplar and guidance role of old models. At the same time, we 
must try vigorously to find, train, and publicize new models who 
have distinctive characteristics of our times and who will exert 
major influence on others. We must vigorously launch all kinds 
of activities to learn from Lei Feng and build spiritual 
civilization, actively participate in local public welfare 
services, transform prevailing habits and customs, assist people 
in poverty and difficulty, and take part in disaster relief to 
contribute to fostering new social ethics. We must earnestly 
strengthen leadership over activities of learning from Lei Feng 
and building spiritual civilization. We must guide the 
initiative of the vast numbers of officers and men displayed in 
learning from Lei Feng and building spiritual civilization at 
their work posts so that they will work hard to accomplish 
military training and related tasks.

  [Text] Headed by Abulaidi Amudurexiti, acting chairman of 
the Xinjiang autonomous regional government, the autonomous 
regional group for conveying Spring Festival greetings visited 
organs of the Xinjiang Military District this morning. They 
were warmly welcomed by military district leaders Pan Zhaomin 
and Fu Bingyao as well as the broad masses of officers and men. 
  On behalf of the autonomous regional party committee, the 
autonomous regional people's congress Standing Committee, the 
autonomous regional people's government, the autonomous regional 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and 
the 15.8 million people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, 
Abulaidi Amudurexiti extended cordial greetings to the 
headquarters, the Political Department, and Logistics Department 
of the Xinjiang Military District, as well as to all officers 
and men of the People's Liberation Army and their families 
stationed north and south of the Tian Shan and along the border 
defense front. 
  Abulaidi Amudurexiti stated: Under the guidance of both 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, the past 
year was one in which we comprehensively carried out the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. During the 
year we seized the opportunities to deepen reform; open up wider 
to the outside world; and bring about sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development as well as overall progress in 
society. These achievements resulted from the correct guidance 
provided by the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and 
the Central Military Commission as well as from the concerted 
efforts made by people and soldiers of all nationalities who 
share a common fate. Troops stationed in Xinjiang have 
participated in and supported local economic construction, 
contributed to their second home town, and promoted the social 
stability and prosperity of the autonomous region. People of 
all nationalities in Xinjiang will never forget their 
contributions. 
  Fu Bingyao, deputy commander of the Lanzhou Military Region 
and commander of the Xinjiang Military District, said: Over the 
past year, party committees and people's governments at all 
levels, as well as people of all nationalities in the autonomous 
region, have actively supported army building, regarded the 
military as a great wall and soldiers a part of their family, 
and tried every possible means to overcome difficulties for army 
units. Their efforts have played an important role in helping 
army units and organs victoriously accomplish various missions. 
In the coming year, army units and organs within this military 
district will continue to follow the guidance of Comrade 
Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period and the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee in order to make efforts in strengthening the army's 
construction in all fields and its combat readiness so as to 
provide a powerful security guarantee for Xinjiang's reform, 
opening up, and modernization. 
  Leading cadres -- including Jin Yunhui, Xie Fuping, Feng 
Dazhen, and (Simayi Maihesuti) -- participated in this greeting 
activity.

  [Text] This morning, leading cadres of Xinjiang military 
regions visited the regional party committee, the regional 
government, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and 
the Urumqi municipal government [video shows civilian officials 
welcoming a small group of military officers at an entrance, 
cutting to show several military officers talking to seven 
officials across an oval conference table]. 
  During their visits to the regional party committee and 
government, Pan Zhaoming, deputy political commissar of the 
Lanzhou Military Region and political commissar of the Xinjiang 
Military District, extended his festive greetings to the 
regional party committee and government and people of all 
nationalities in Xinjiang on behalf of the military region and 
district party committees and all their officers and men. 
  Pan Zhaoming said: Over the past year, the regional party 
committee, government, and people of all nationalities in 
Xinjiang have rendered many good and practical services for the 
troops, and these services have played a positive role in 
helping the vast number of officers and men keep their minds in 
serving the military in frontier areas. 
  Abulaidi Amudurexiti, acting chairman of the regional 
government, said: Over the past year, military units in 
Xinjiang have contributed immensely to Xinjiang's stability and 
development and have created a good and stable society in 
Xinjiang. The military has set very good examples in promoting 
army-people unity and national solidarity. This has powerfully 
expedited Xinjiang's economic development. 
  When Xinjiang Military District leaders visited the Xinjiang 
Production and Construction Corps, Fu Bingyao, deputy commander 
of the Lanzhou Military Region and commander of the Xinjiang 
Military District, and Jin Yunhui, deputy secretary of the 
regional party committee and commander of the production and 
construction corps, spoke at the meeting.

<F P=106> [By reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- At the closing meeting of 
the national conference of customs directors today, Li Lanqing, 
State Council vice premier and member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau, said: Customs offices nationwide 
must abide by and support the general situation of "seizing 
opportunities, deepening reforms, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability" to further deepen reform 
in customs operations, as well as to better serve the cause of 
establishing the socialist market economic system and efforts to 
maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy. 
  Li Lanqing pointed out: Customs operations are an important 
part of the country's macroeconomic regulation and control. A 
reform of the customs system must be implemented simultaneously 
with a reform of the country's overall economic structure to 
gradually establish a modern customs system with Chinese 
characteristics that is compatible with the socialist market 
economic system, that is supportive of China's opening up, that 
conforms to general international rules, and that is organically 
unified in terms of convenience and discipline, as well as in 
terms of restrictions and efficiency. 
  He said: In reforming the customs system, we should pay 
attention to the force that we apply, and we should consider the 
ability of all to withstand this force. We must stop unhealthy 
practices and must promote integrity through reform; we must 
control what needs to be controlled and must assign tasks that 
need to be assigned. To achieve these two tasks, we must 
implement the auditing system as well as reform the customs 
declaration system and the system and style of customs 
management. Meanwhile, we must combine customs reform with the 
application of modern technological means to establish a modern 
and highly efficient customs system. 
  Li Lanqing stressed: Customs officials' principal duty is to 
monitor and control import and export activities in accordance 
with the law, as well as to ensure the efficient implementation 
of state policies and laws concerning foreign economic 
activities and trade. Customs offices must strengthen their 
control over imports and exports, as well as strictly check and 
penalize illegal activities such as certification evasion, tax 
evasion, and tax cover-ups to safeguard the proper economic 
order. 
  Li Lanqing said: Under the direct leadership of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council, we have made progress 
in the current antismuggling struggle, but we must not relax it 
one bit. We must fully realize that the antismuggling struggle 
is a long-term and arduous task, and we must continue to 
strictly crack down on illegal smuggling activities. Customs 
offices must further bring into play their principal 
antismuggling departments, gather the support of local 
governments and their antismuggling leading groups, strengthen 
their cooperation with the relevant judicial and law-enforcement 
organs, exploit the role of the relevant press and propaganda 
departments, and spur the broad masses to do a good job in the 
comprehensive control of smuggling activities. Customs offices 
must resolutely implement the principle of "making arrests at 
sea, catching people in ports, investigating at customs 
checkpoints, exercising control of the market, and imposing 
heavy penalties" while undertaking antismuggling tasks. In 
particular, they must insist on imposing strict penalties and 
speed up investigations of major cases, and they must not 
replace punishment with fines. Customs offices must 
simultaneously undertake antismuggling and anticorruption tasks 
to ensure the healthy development of the country's economic 
construction. 
  He asked customs offices to impose strict self-discipline, 
realistically strengthen their development, and systematically 
control their operations. Customs offices must establish clean 
administration and undertake reform measures to ensure the 
proper use of power and to prevent corruption from spreading. 
He said he hoped that in the new year, customs offices 
nationwide would continue to uphold the principle whereby tasks 
are focused on promotion and on strict controls to effectively 
safeguard the country's economy.

Summing-Up and Commendation Meeting on Antipoverty Work; Chen 
Huanyou Calls For Further Implementing Various Antipoverty 
Measures with a High Sense of Responsibility and Urgency; 198 
Antipoverty Workers and 75 Advanced Units in Antipoverty Work 
Commended"] 
  [Text] "The province has made gratifying achievements in 
antipoverty work and the cause of breaking away from poverty and 
becoming prosperous is full of hope; we should further implement 
various antipoverty measures with a high sense of responsibility 
and urgency." This is the gist of the speech made by Chen 
Huanyou, provincial party committee secretary and governor, at 
the provincial summing-up and commendation meeting on 
antipoverty work. On 29 January, the provincial party committee 
and government held this meeting to give a warm welcome to the 
honorable return of the provincial party committee's second 
antipoverty work team, sum up the province's antipoverty work in 
recent years, and commend 198 advanced workers and 75 advanced 
units in antipoverty work. Cao Hongming, deputy secretary of 
the provincial party committee, chaired the meeting. 
  Cao Keming, Xu Zhonglin, Gao Dezheng, Jiang Yongrong, Zhang 
Huaixi, Duan Xushen, and other provincial leaders attended the 
meeting. The Yancheng City party Committee and Government, the 
provincial planning and economic commission, the provincial 
antipoverty work team stationed in Shuyang, and other units as 
well as representatives of antipoverty team members gave reports 
on their experience in this regard. 
  Chen Huanyou delivered an important speech on antipoverty 
work. He said: Antipoverty work is a very important and 
significant issue. Helping people in economically weak areas to 
break away from poverty and become prosperous as soon as 
possible has been an important issue to which the provincial 
party committee and government have paid a good deal of 
attention. According to the strategy of "stressing reform and 
opening up of more economically developed areas, mainly along 
the Chang Jiang, and accelerating economic development on the 
one hand; stressing the reform in economically weak areas with 
localities north of Huai He as the center and stepping up the 
pace of breaking away from poverty and becoming prosperous on 
the other hand," the provincial party committee and government 
have further supported economically weak areas in developing the 
economy in the aspects of personnel, capital, and materials 
during the past couple of years. The provincial authorities 
concentrated efforts to strengthen infrastructure construction 
in northern Jiangsu and as organized the linkup of units 
directly under the provincial authorities with poor townships 
and towns by dispatching work groups to help develop the economy 
and by promoting an exchange of cadres between northern and 
southern Jiangsu to carry out cooperative activities. Through 
the joint efforts of all sectors around the province, 
particularly the hard work of cadres and people in economically 
weak areas, gratifying achievements have been made in 
antipoverty work. In view of the conditions in areas north of 
Huai He, a road of development for braking away from poverty and 
becoming prosperous as soon as possible has been found and 
preliminary achievements have been scored in the course of 
practice. The agricultural production rose steadily, structural 
readjustment was remarkably accelerated, and the development of 
a diversified economy has become the main source of the increase 
in peasants' income. New vitality was added to industrial 
production and some townships and towns formerly weak in 
industry are starting their own backbone projects. 
Infrastructure construction continued to be stressed; the 
construction of markets saw a good beginning and more and more 
peasants are participating in the circulation services. 
Individual and private economies became active by the day; 
labor export grew rapidly; peasants had higher income and 
collective accumulation increased. Another 400,000 people in 
Jiangsu shook off poverty in 1993. The per capita income of 
most of the 58 poor townships and towns, which were emphatically 
supported by the provincial authorities, has exceeded 600 yuan; 
of which, the per capita income of 30 townships and towns in 
Shuyang County exceeded 700 yuan, the village revenue increased 
by 20.3 percent over the previous year, and the income of 
village-level collective economies reached 20,000 yuan on 
average. If economically weak areas develop along such a 
course, they will surely bring about an even greater change by 
the end of this century. 
  Chen Huanyou stressed in his speech that we should further 
implement various antipoverty measures and strive to beef up the 
capability of economically weak areas in self-development with a 
strong sense of urgency and a high sense of political 
responsibility, so as to step up the pace of breaking away from 
poverty, becoming prosperous, and moving toward a relatively 
comfortable life. On this year's antipoverty work, Chen Huanyou 
noted that the provincial authorities should stress the 
following issues: 1) Supporting the work with policies -- it is 
necessary to continue to implement and improve the policies of 
supporting the economic development in poor areas and to provide 
the support in the aspects of personnel, capital, and materials. 
We should do our best to add more key projects in northern 
Jiangsu. 2) Organization and coordination -- in line with the 
principle of taking measures suitable to local conditions, 
rational division of labor, supplementing each other's 
advantages, and joint development and having consolidated the 
linkup of the north and south, we should further expand economic 
alliance and cooperation between economically developed cities 
and counties and their less developed counterparts through 
various forms and levels. The provincial authorities should 
take measures to help launch projects with participation of both 
the north and south. 3) Intensifying infrastructure 
construction, particularly the construction of power supplies 
and transport networks, with a view to making an end of 
no-electricity villages and basically establishing highway 
networks among cities, counties, and townships within three 
years or so. 
  Chen Huanyou announced at the meeting: The provincial party 
committee has decided to keep dispatching antipoverty work teams 
to poor areas this year, appropriately readjust and expand 
supporting areas, and make greater efforts in antipoverty work. 
Some units originally stationed in Shuyang this year will be 
transferred to Guanyu and Suining. He hoped that units 
concerned would take the overall conditions into consideration, 
happily accept the mission assigned to them by the provincial 
party committee, overcome difficulties through all possible 
means, and do a good job in their work. In addition to doing 
their best to give personnel, capital, and material support, 
leading comrades of various rear units should go deep into 
townships and towns involved to give more concrete guidelines 
and solve actual problems there. He called on antipoverty work 
teams to conduct their work with creativity. The major tasks of 
the teams are assisting localities in reform, opening up, 
developing the economy, handling well the relations between 
reform and development and stability, and promoting a 
comprehensive social progress. All work teams should go deep 
into the realities of life, intensify investigations and 
studies, forge close ties and unite with local cadres and 
people, and do more actual and helpful work for the localities 
wholeheartedly. He demanded that party committees and 
governments of localities, where the work teams are stationed, 
actively strengthen their ties with work teams, keep in touch, 
respect, and support each other at work and unite together to 
advance forward. 
  Chen Huanyou also demanded that all cities and counties link 
up with economically weak townships and villages level by level 
and help them promote coordinated regional economic development.

<F P=106> [By Shi Jun (4258 6511): "Take Improvement of Economic </F>
Results As the Core in Accelerating Economic Development"] 
  [Text] Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping contains the largest number of expositions on 
accelerating economic development and is richest in contents in 
this regard. One of the conspicuous ideas is that, while 
improving economic results, we should accelerate economic 
development. In his talks during an inspection tour to southern 
China, he pointed out: "Those blessed with conditions 
advantageous to development should not be obstructed. In areas 
where conditions permit, local development should proceed as 
fast as possible. Nothing is to be feared so long as we stress 
efficiency and quality and develop the export-oriented economy." 
He also pointed out: "In developing China's economy, we should 
strive to reach a new rung every few years. Of course, this 
should not be interpreted as encouraging an unrealistically high 
speed. We should be down to earth and stress efficiency to 
realize steady and coordinated progress." When hearing reports 
on the Sixth Five-Year Plan, he pointed out: "We should attach 
importance to improving economic results and not blindly pursue 
growth in output value and output." On two occasions when 
hearing reports on the economic situation, he stressed: "We 
should not stress only product quantity but should first stress 
quality. The key to expanding export sales lies in improving 
product quality.... Otherwise, the long-term, sustained, and 
stable development of the economy will be out of the question 
and the economy will eventually wither some day." "In 
industrial production, especially the production of export 
products, the focus is on improving quality and placing quality 
first." 
  We can thus see that there are conditions, preconditions, or 
basic requirements when Comrade Deng Xiaoping stresses the need 
to accelerate economic development. These conditions, 
preconditions, or basic requirements are efficiency, quality, 
export orientation, and the maintenance of stable and 
coordinated development or, what we usually call economic 
results in a broad sense. Therefore, when considering the issue 
of accelerating economic development, we must place the 
fundamental starting point on improving economic results: 
"Shifting the economic work as a whole onto an orbit based on 
improving the economic results." 
  At present, China's economic work still falls far short of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's aforesaid demands. This finds 
expression in the following four principal aspects: 1. 
The economic results are still relatively poor. In recent 
years, China's total output value of industrial production has 
been growing at an average annual rate of over 10 percent, 
reaching over 20 percent in certain years, but the number of 
enterprises operating at a loss and the total amount of losses 
have kept on rising. In the first 11 months of 1993, the four 
principal performance indicators, i.e., the product sales rate, 
the ratio of profits and taxes to capital, the cost-profit 
ratio, and the rate of circulating fund turnover, were all lower 
than the levels during the Seventh Five-Year Plan. This 
situation of high speed and poor efficiency shows that China's 
industry has not changed its extensive operation of highly 
efficient mobilization but inefficient use of resources. 
2. Product quality has not been improved 
considerably. Despite much efforts to improve quality, 
there have been little results. Not only have the grade and 
level of many products not been raised but the production of 
shoddy products has continued in spite of repeated prohibitions. 
What is more serious is that there have been frequent cases of 
fake and shoddy products, especially fake medicines, 
insecticides, and chemical fertilizers which harm the state and 
the people. The quality of a country and a nation is eventually 
reflected in its material products; the economic results of an 
enterprise also come directly from its products. Without high 
quality products, how can we get good economic results and 
improve the quality of people's lives? 3. The growth in 
export earnings has been less than satisfactory. According 
to statistics, in the first 11 months of 1993, the country's 
total import and export volume rose by 16.5 percent over the 
corresponding period in the previous year. Total import volume 
grew by 27.8 percent while total export volume by only 6.2 
percent, a disparity of over 20 percentage points. We should 
affirm the tremendous achievements in opening up to the outside 
world but we should not overlook the problems in developing an 
export-oriented economy, especially in increasing foreign 
exchange earnings through exports. If we fail to increase 
export earnings, this will in turn restrict our efforts to open 
wider to the outside world. We must attach great importance to 
the economic results in developing an export-oriented 
economy--export earnings. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed this 
out as far back as in 1985. He said: "We have just started to 
turn the economy in the special economic zones from 
domestic-oriented to export-oriented and, for this reason, we 
still do not have many good products for export. As long as 
Shenzhen fails to do this, it has not passed the test and cannot 
prove that its development is sound." Naturally, we cannot say 
that Shenzhen and many coastal areas have not passed the test 
till now. However, as far as most localities and enterprises are 
concerned, they have not yet passed the test or at least have 
not passed the test satisfactorialy. 4. The economic 
structure is still irrational. Imbalances in the economic 
structure have always been a major problem obstructing China's 
sound economic growth. It is also a fundamental crux affecting 
the improvement of economic results. Although we have made 
constant adjustments, we have not been able to get rid of the 
interruptive and ill effects of an imbalanced structure. Today, 
the irrational conditions in product mix, industrial structure, 
and the enterprise organization pattern are still quite serious 
and are tending to worsen in some respects. The chief 
manifestations are: Infrastructure has obviously lagged behind 
in national economic development; basic industry has lagged far 
behind the processing industry; within the processing industry, 
goods in great demand are extremely undersupplied while goods 
for which there is no consumer demand are extremely 
oversupplied; and the level of enterprise specialized and 
socialized production is low. According to surveys, in recent 
years we have been able to meet only about 80 percent of demand 
for power supplies, 60 percent of demand for railway transport, 
and only one-third of the demand for some major bottleneck 
aspects [zhu yao xian zhi kou 0031 6008 7098 0455 0656]. In 
light of the irrational economic structure, in a talk with 
comrades in charge of the State Planning Commission in 1982 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "In our overall economic 
development strategy, energy and transport are focus points as 
is agriculture." He also pointed out: "If we really want to 
engage in construction, we should build some key projects. It 
will not do if we do not have some key projects.... We would 
rather cut back on local projects, especially some ordinary 
processing industrial projects." In December 1986, he again 
stressed that "we can only take this path." It now seems that 
we should take this path even more unswervingly. 
  What should we do to improve economic results? Aside 
from deepening reform, we should rely on scientific and 
technological progress and improvement in the quality of 
laborers. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has a series of 
expositions on this count. At the National Conference on 
Science in March 1978, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Contemporary 
natural science is being applied to production on an 
unprecedented scale and with unprecedented speed. This has 
given all fields of material production an entirely new look. 
With the same manpower and the same number of man-hours, people 
can turn out scores or hundreds of times more products than 
before now. What has brought about the tremendous advances in 
the productive forces and the vast increase in labor 
productivity? Mainly the power of science and the power of 
technology." In 1988 Comrade Deng Xiaoping again made a highly 
theoretical condensation of the primary transformation role of 
science and technology in contemporary productive forces and 
socioeconomic development from a new angle of view. He pointed 
out: "Marx said that science and technology are productive 
forces and facts have proven that his remark is quite correct. 
As I see it, science and technology are primary productive 
forces." Precisely because he has a profound understanding of 
the tremendous role of contemporary science and technology, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed: China cannot 
develop without science. It must rely on science, technology, 
and education. 
  In line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's aforementioned ideas, 
the 13th Party Congress explicitly put forward the need to 
"place the development of scientific, technological, and 
educational cause in first place and shift economic construction 
onto the orbit of relying on scientific and technological 
progress and improving the quality of laborers." 
  It should be soberly noted that promoting scientific and 
technological progress and improving the quality of laborers is 
an arduous, complex, and gigantic project which requires hard 
and protracted efforts on our part. At present, further efforts 
should be made to solve the following three issues well: 
  First, uphold the principle that economic construction 
must rely on science and technology and that the latter must be 
geared to the former. Science and technology should give 
priority to promoting economic construction and improving 
economic results; vigorously strengthening the integration of 
science and industry, of science and agriculture, and the 
integration of science and trade; and quickening the pace of 
turning scientific and technological achievements into real 
productive forces. We should attach importance to the 
technological renovation of existing enterprises and improve the 
economic results of stock assets by improving and developing 
production technology, optimizing the allocation of incremental 
assets, and improving the economic results of stock assets. 
  Second, attach great importance to education, 
especially the training of in-service workers and staff members, 
to improve the quality of laborers. While affirming the 
vigorous development of educational undertakings, we must also 
squarely face the problems that exist. Viewed from the current 
situation, the many problems criticized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
have not been resolved and some have even taken a continuous 
turn for the worse. Take for example, the remuneration of 
intellectuals. The leaders of some localities and units spend a 
lot of money on new sedans but they do not guarantee the basic 
wages of teachers. The phenomenon of stressing formality and 
going through the motions in training in-service workers and 
staff members is also conspicuous, leading to a relative drop in 
the quality of workers and staff members in many enterprises. 
For this reason, we should keep firmly in mind Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's instruction that "education should be firmly 
grasped," put in a lot of time and energy in realistically 
solving the existing problems, and speedily raise the quality of 
laborers. 
  Third, energetically study and take for reference 
advanced foreign technology and managerial expertise and follow 
a new path of mastering and assimilating imported 
technology. In the past few years, we have continuously 
broadened the scope of studying and taking for reference 
advanced foreign technology and managerial experience but we 
have not attached sufficient importance to the work of mastering 
and assimilating what we have imported. We have spent a lot of 
money importing equipment, even advanced equipment, but we have 
not done a good job of mastering and assimilating what we have 
imported and some equipment has not been applied in production 
for a long time. Although we have introduced a lot of advanced 
managerial expertise, we have mastered little, with some being 
pigeonholed or laid aside. This trend should be rectified as 
quickly as possible. When importing advanced foreign technology 
and managerial expertise in future, we should conduct scientific 
demonstrations and make the correct choice. We should consider 
not only their advanced character but, more importantly, their 
suitability. Genuine efforts should be made to closely 
integrate their introduction into the country with their mastery 
and assimilation and we should be good at turning other people's 
know-how into our own. 
  In short, improving economic results is a crucial issue 
which 
has a bearing on whether or not we can increase our 
comprehensive national power, raise the people's living 
standards, and build up our capacity for sustained economic 
development. This should draw the close attention of the whole 
party. Conscientious efforts should be made to rectify the 
tendency of regarding speed as superior to efficiency and 
unswervingly take the development path of stressing quality and 
efficiency to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu, 
kuai su, jian kang 2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 1660] development 
of the national economy.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Feb (XINHUA) -- To simplify and 
standardize the tax system, and to promote reform aimed at 
establishing a tax-sharing system, the State Council recently 
decided to abolish the fair trade tax, the livestock trade tax, 
the special fuel tax, the bonus tax, and the wage regulatory 
tax. It also decided to abrogate seven tax codes: "Provisions 
for Trial Implementation Regarding Fair Trade Taxes," "Interim 
Regulations on Livestock Trade Taxes," "Provisions for Trial 
Implementation on Collecting Special Fuel Taxes," "Interim 
Provisions on Bonus Taxes on State-Run Enterprises," "Interim 
Provisions on Wage Regulatory Taxes on State-Run Enterprises," 
"Interim Provisions on Bonus Taxes on Collective Enterprises," 
and "Interim Provisions on Bonus Taxes on Institutions." 
Meanwhile, it delegated power regarding the management of 
animal slaughter and banquet taxes, allowing provincial, 
autonomous regional, and municipal people's governments to 
decide on their own whether to continue to levy or stop 
collecting such taxes in light of local economic development.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- The "State Council 
Provisions on the Work Hours of Workers and Staff Members" have 
been promulgated. The Labor and Personnel Ministries have 
offered the following explanation regarding these "Provisions": 
  The provisions give workers and staff members more time to 
study, educate their children, and attend to household chores. 
They will surely further arouse the initiative of workers and 
staff members in socialist construction, preserve and inspire 
their enthusiasm for production, and increase their vitality in 
production and construction. These provisions appropriately 
shorten the work hours, scientifically and rationally schedule 
work and rest hours, and carry great significance for protecting 
the health of workers and staff members; for improving work 
efficiency and labor productivity; for promoting better 
management in organizations, enterprises, and institutions; and 
for advancing the development of production. 
  There will be a unified system of work hours throughout the 
country. The State Council "Provisions" apply to workers and 
staff members in all organs, mass organizations, enterprises, 
institutions, and other organizations in the PRC. Enterprises 
include those under various single-mode or mixed economic 
ownerships, such as state-owned, collectively owned, privately 
run, individually run, and foreign-funded enterprises. They 
also include mines; factories; and construction, communications 
and transportation, logging, farming, commercial, and service 
entities. 
  Our country used to implement special provisions regarding 
the work hours of workers and staff members working under 
extraordinary conditions and those whose circumstances were 
special. For instance, the chemical industry implemented a 
system consisting of "three work days and one day off," as well 
as a system of six or seven work hours, for workers engaged in 
operations involving toxic and harmful substances, based on the 
distinctive aspects and conditions of production. Coal mines 
implemented a four-shift system, consisting of six work hours 
per shift, for operations in coal pits. The textile industry 
implemented a system of "four shifts with three workers working 
and one resting on each shift." Female workers and staff members 
who had babies under one year old were given an hour for nursing 
each work day. If the work hours of workers and staff members 
working under extraordinary conditions or those whose 
circumstances are special still need to be shortened 
appropriately following the implementation of these provisions, 
they should be handled according to relevant state provisions. 
  The work and rest hours of state organs and institutions 
must 
be unified. Beginning the day the "Provisions" are implemented, 
rest days will fall on Saturday and Sunday in the first week and 
on Sunday in the second week, with the cycle continuing 
regardless of which month or year it is. This will facilitate 
the normal operation of all endeavors in all sectors of society. 
In light of their actual conditions, enterprises may make 
provisions in accordance with the requirement for an average 
44-hour work week consisting of eight hours each day. State 
organs aside, hospitals, kindergartens, primary schools, and 
units having a bearing on people's livelihoods must also unify 
their work and rest hours. Therefore, we will unify the work and 
rest hours of both institutions and state organs. Although 
workers and staff members in the civil aviation and railway 
sectors may work for more than eight hours each day, their 
average work week will not exceed 44 hours. 
  In implementing the "Provisions," all units should 
strengthen 
management, strictly enforce discipline, and strive to tap their 
potential to ensure the completion of their production tasks and 
work without increasing personnel and spending. They should not 
let the implementation of the 44-hour work week affect their 
normal operations and economic performance; nor should they 
reduce the salaries of their workers and staff members. No 
enterprise or individual may extend the work hours of their 
workers and staff members without authorization. We should 
remedy the practice of fulfilling production tasks through 
overtime. If special circumstances and urgent tasks require the 
extension of work hours for workers and staff members, we should 
follow relevant state provisions. All social service units -- 
such as commercial, catering, public transportation, postal and 
telecommunications, and transportation units -- must consider 
people's interests in rescheduling production and work hours. 
They should take effective measures to solve problems arising 
from such rescheduling, and create more convenient living and 
working conditions for people. Labor and personnel departments 
all levels should supervise and inspect progress in implementing 
the "Provisions." If the "Provisions" are violated, they should 
mete out punishment in accordance with relevant provisions.

<F P=106> [By staff correspondent Wang Kejun (3769 0344 6511) and </F>
staff reporter Fang Jiangshan (2455 3068 1472): "New Changes in 
Labor Employment in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, our country's labor employment saw a 
series of new changes. According to the figures provided by 
relevant state departments, the urban and rural labor 
supply-demand contradiction was alleviated, the labor structure 
saw change, the speed of labor flow accelerated, and the labor 
market achieved an initial scale. 
<H3>  The Urban and Rural Labor Supply-Demand Contradiction Was 
Alleviated </H3>
  In 1993, the number of persons who newly entered the labor 
force throughout the country (that is, the population reaching 
16 years of age) fell by 1 million as compared with the previous 
year, while the population reaching the retirement age (55 years 
for women and 60 years for men) saw a slight increase over the 
previous year. Thus, seen from the labor supply situation, 
there was a slight reduction in the growth of labor resources. 
In 1993, the national labor resources totaled 731.78 million 
people. 
  Seen from the labor demand situation, the number of people 
who were placed in employment was still quite large. According 
to estimates, in 1993, throughout the country 605.9 million were 
employed, an increase of 11.58 million as compared to the 
previous year. Of these, the number of staff and workers in 
urban areas was 150.4 million, an increase of 2.48 million. The 
number of people engaged in private and individual operations 
was 9.5 million, an increase of 1.12 million. In the rural 
areas, the laborers in the small towns and villages totaled 446 
million, an increase of 7.98 million. At the same time, there 
was a slight increase in the urban unemployment rate. In 1993, 
about 4 million people in urban areas were unemployed, an 
increase of close to 400,000. The unemployment rate was 2.6 
percent, a growth of 0.3 percentage points. According to some 
local surveys, of those currently unemployed in the urban areas, 
about 50 percent are not anxious to be allocated work posts. 
They wish to seek their own work and, in this way, they will 
likely achieve incomes which are no lower than those of the 
general urban staff and workers. 
<H5>  There Were Changes in the Employment Structure </H5>
  Analyzing things in terms of the industrial structure, the 
proportion of primary industry employment has declined and the 
proportions of secondary and tertiary industry employment have 
increased. At the end of 1993, the number of people employed in 
primary industry was 348.39 million, an increase of 700,000 over 
the previous year. This was 57.5 percent of the total, a 
decline of 1 percent as compared with the same period in the 
previous year. The number of people employed in secondary 
industry was 132.69 million, an increase of 3.48 million over 
the previous year. They constituted 21.9 percent of the total, 
a growth of 0.2 percent. People employed in tertiary industry 
totaled 124.82 million, an increase of 7.4 million as compared 
to the end of the previous year. The proportion they constituted 
was 20.6 percent, a growth of 0.8 percent. 
  In respect of the people employed in urban areas, the speed 
of growth of those employed in the nonstate-owned economy was 
faster than the speed of growth of those employed in the 
state-owned economy. The people employed in state-owned units 
totaled 110.94 million, an increase of 2.05 million people or 
1.88 percent. The number of people employed in nonstate-owned 
units (including those employed in urban collective operations, 
urban private operations, and individual operations) was 48.96 
million, a growth of 3.27 percent, 1.39 percentage points higher 
than the figure for state-owned units. Of these, the people 
employed in joint operations and foreign-funded operation units 
totaled 3.43 million, a growth of 21.63 percent, 19.75 
percentage points faster than the growth of employment in 
state-owned units. The number of people employed in urban 
private operations and individual operations was 9.5 million, a 
growth of 13.37 percent, 11.49 percentage points faster than the 
growth of those employed in state-owned units. 
  Within state-owned units, the proportion of permanent staff 
and workers declined, while the proportion of contract staff and 
workers increased. At the end of 1993, the permanent staff and 
workers in state-owned units numbered 74.33 million, a reduction 
of 1.28 million people. They comprised 67 percent of the total, 
a decrease of 2 percent. The contract staff and workers 
numbered 23.3 million people, an increase of 2.71 million. This 
constituted a proportion of 21 percent, up 2 percent. According 
to Ministry of Labor reports, the reform whereby within the 
labor system, the labor contract system for employees 
constitutes the main part, has now developed from the partial 
experimental stage to a stage where this is being implemented on 
a regional basis in over 70 cities throughout the country. This 
year, this reform will be implemented in an overall way 
throughout the country. 
<H3>  The Renewed Increase in the Number of Staff and Workers Has 
Slowed </H3>
  Since the beginning of 1993, a prominent characteristic of 
the changes in the number of staff and workers is that the 
renewed increase in the number of staff and workers has slowed. 
In July and August last year, the number of workers had again 
reached the figure at the end of the previous year. However, by 
September 1993, the figure had dropped back to below the figure 
at the end of the previous year, a phenomenon which had not been 
seen for many years. According to an analysis, there are two 
main reasons for the slowing of the increase: The first is that 
there has been a strengthening of the labor-use restraint 
mechanism and, as a result, there has been a reduction in the 
use of labor. In 1993, all regions actively implemented reform 
of the employment and the labor assignment systems and, as a 
result, there has been a continued strengthening of the 
labor-use restraint mechanism in enterprises. Many enterprises, 
taking consideration of labor cost benefits, have done 
everything they can not to increase, or only slightly increase, 
their workforce, made efforts to tap latent potential within the 
enterprise, and dismissed a large number of temporary workers 
and workers outside the plan. Second there has been a change in 
employment concepts and the consciousness of the market has 
strengthened. In 1993, close to 1.5 million staff members and 
workers voluntarily left their jobs, retired, or terminated or 
abrogated their employment contracts. This was an increase of 
about 50 percent compared with the previous year. 
<H5>  The Rate of Labor Flow Has Increased </H5>
  In 1993, the number of rural laborers who went to other 
regions to seek employment increased, with about 50 million 
people seeking work in other areas. Of these, about 13 million 
people entered various types of units or individual trades in 
urban areas. This large-scale flow of labor has also begun to 
move from a disordered to an ordered flow. For example, in 
1993, Guangdong Province established labor cooperative links 
with eight provinces including Sichuan, Hunan, and Jiangxi. 
Those rural laborers who intend going to work in Guangdong need 
to consult their local labor department first before proceeding 
to Guangdong. To a certain degree, this prevents the blind flow 
of rural labor. 
  Because of the change in employment concepts and an increase 
in market consciousness, some staff members and workers are no 
longer satisfied spending all their life in the work post to 
which they were originally assigned. Instead, they are seeking 
posts in which the income is higher or in which they can better 
use their special skills. A sample survey has shown that about 
30 percent of staff and workers are unsatisfied in their present 
work and hope to shift jobs. According to estimates, in 1993, 
about 4.5 million people were transferred between units, an 
increase of close to 500,000 compared with the previous year. 
This figure represented about 3 percent of the total number of 
staff and workers. Of these, close to 400,000 transferred to 
other provinces. 
<H5>  An Initial Scale Has Been Achieved in the Labor Market </H5>
  In 1993, all areas further strengthened the building of 
labor 
markets at various levels and all sorts of labor agents and 
human resources interflow meetings emerged to meet the needs. 
Now, 30 provinces, cities, and regions, as well as 15 
ministries and commissions under the State Council, have already 
established human resources interflow organs, while the 
prefectural and county interflow organs number over 2,000 and 
nongovernment employment agencies number close to 200. They 
have thus formed a basic national human resources interflow 
network. In addition, throughout the country, 500 fixed human 
resources markets have been established and 10,000 human 
resources interflow meetings have been organized. The initial 
establishment of the various levels of labor market has promoted 
the rational flow of human resources. This has allowed our 
country's human resources interflow work to shift from the 
traditional system of unified arrangements and unified 
allocation to a new system where personnel choose their own 
employment and units choose their own employees.

<F P=106> [Report: "Suggesting an Effective Prescription for Curing </F>
`Rural Disease'--Combining Development of Nonfarming Industries 
With Construction of Small Cities and Towns"] 
  [Text] The rapid changes in the economic structure, and 
the rise of township and town enterprises as a new force in the 
economy, have promoted prosperity in the rural areas of our 
country and have brought substantial benefits to the vast 
numbers of peasants. At the same time, however, this has also 
given rise to a noteworthy "rural disease." In order to deal 
with this problem, the State Council's Research Office carried 
out a systematic investigation and submitted a special report. 
RENMIN RIBAO reporters have summarized the main points of the 
report as follows: 
<H5>  The Noteworthy "Rural Disease" </H5>
  Since the beginning of reform and opening, major changes 
have 
occurred in the urban and rural economic structures in our 
country. In particular, various nonfarming industries, composed 
mainly of township and town enterprises, have developed greatly 
in the countryside. However, some special phenomena also 
appeared in such developments and have been called a "rural 
disease" which mainly finds expression in the following facts. 
  The rural industry is widely scattered. In 1992, there were 
20.79 million township and town enterprises throughout the 
country, and more than 19 million were located in natural 
villages. The advantage of such a scattered distribution was 
that the starting costs would be much lower and villagers could 
be engaged in both farming and industrial production. However, 
there were more disadvantages: First, the enterprises were 
operating in a closed condition; second, they were widely 
scattered; third, it was hard to control industrial pollution; 
and fourth, there was a serious degree of duplicated production 
and competition remained at a low level, even causing serious 
waste. 
  The construction of small cities was not well planned and 
coordinated. At present, most rural towns with comparatively 
developed industry and commerce in the coastal provinces have 
been developed into small cities. In some areas, small cities 
and towns have been linked up. However, the size of most such 
cities is still too small, so the scale of the urban districts 
uneconomical. They require huge investment in the construction 
of infrastructural facilities but their utilization rate is 
rather low and too much land is occupied. 
  The nonfarming population is now migrating between cities 
and 
the countryside. They have their native residence in the 
countryside and still undertake the land contracts but they work 
and live in cities and towns. They possess the means of 
production and livelihood both in their native rural areas and 
in cities. On the one hand, they have no interest in engaging 
in farming production or no longer have the ability to do so; on 
the other hand, they cannot gain the same status as urban 
residents. 
  In order to promote the healthy development of the rural 
economic communities, we must give guidance to the development 
of the nonfarming industries in the countryside and should 
combine this with the construction of small cities. In 
practice, we should explicitly adopt the following guidelines: 
First, remove the constraining factors and create a policy 
environment which can naturally effect the "combination." 
Second, the "combination" mainly relies on the full use and 
proper transformation of existing small cities, and also on the 
development of new small cities according to scientific plans, 
so that their layout is reasonable and their development is 
orderly. Third, the "combination" is not aimed at concentrating 
the scattered nonfarming industrial projects, because this is 
unrealistic; instead, it is mainly aimed at concentrating new 
projects in the future. Fourth, the "combination" should not 
only be effected between the nonfarming industries and the small 
cities but also between the nonfarming population and the small 
cities. 
<H5>  Giving Positive Guidance to the Combination </H5>
  Giving guidance to the combination between the development 
of 
the nonfarming industries and the construction of small cities 
is of great significance in many aspects: 
  1. This will quicken the development of the tertiary 
industry and will shift more surplus labor force from farming to 
other industries. In the last more than 10 years, various 
nonfarming industries have made substantial development in the 
countryside with the rise of the township and town enterprises. 
In 1992, such industries employed 106 million rural working 
people. At present, there are about 170 million surplus working 
people in the rural areas, equal to the total urban population 
of the 517 cities in the whole country. In future, the meaning 
of the term "local employment" should be broadened. In the 
past, "local" mainly referred to people's native places; 
henceforth, "local" should go beyond people's native places. 
Facts show that the tertiary industry can absorb a much larger 
quantity of the work force than secondary industry; and the main 
supporters of the tertiary industry are cities and towns. That 
is to say, small cities should have a much stronger capacity to 
absorb the surplus labor force in the countryside. 
  2. This will create more favorable conditions for farming 
operations on an appropriate scale and thus make a new leap in 
agricultural production. Henceforth, in order to raise our 
country's agricultural production, especially grain production, 
to a new stage, we shall have to solve the problems caused by an 
excessive number of peasants and the small area of farmland in 
per capita terms. 
  3. This will mitigate the pressure caused by the surplus 
rural labor force on the large and medium cities. In current 
social and economic circumstances, the household registration 
system for permanent residence is no longer effective in 
restraining peasants from moving into cities. The sole method 
is to give more effective guidance to the population movement 
and actively encourage the combination between the development 
of the nonfarming industries and the construction of small 
cities. While developing nonfarming industries, the rural areas 
can also develop small cities which will become "huge sponges" 
absorbing a large number of surplus working people from 
agriculture. This should be the most realistic method suited to 
the national conditions. 
  4. This will promote family planning and reduce the natural 
population growth and thereby enhance the quality of the 
population. Family planning can be promoted among peasants who 
have moved into cities, thus reducing the natural population 
growth; on the other hand, through their marriages, peasants can 
be connected to the urban population and the higher educational 
level and this will promote the enhancement of the population 
quality. 
  5. This will economize on land and construction funds. As 
the nonfarming industries in the rural areas are relatively 
concentrated and are developed on large stretches of land 
according to unified plans, the outlay will become more 
reasonable. The enterprises may share the same public 
utilities. This will economize on the use of land and save more 
funds for the construction of infrastructural facilities. 
  6. This will enhance civilization and promote social 
progress in the rural communities because the development of the 
cultural, educational, scientific, technological, and public 
health undertakings is all preconditioned by the relatively 
concentrated residence of the people. 
<H5>  Backup Policies and Measures </H5>
  In order to promote the combination between the development 
of nonfarming industries and the construction of small cities, 
it is proposed that backup reforms and corresponding policies be 
gradually adopted mainly in the following aspects: 
  The household registration and permanent residence policy. 
The policy for managing peasants' permanent residence and 
resettlement should be made more flexible so that peasants are 
allowed to move to small cities after they meet certain 
requirements. In general, the scope of such free movement can 
be extended to county towns or towns below the county level. 
The general principle is to keep large and medium cities stable 
and to develop small cities and small towns; the purpose is to 
promote common socioeconomic development. Policies in this 
regard may be formulated by various provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities according to their conditions under 
the guidance of the state's general arrangements. 
  The land policy. There should be a system for strictly 
examining and approving the use of land for the development of 
nonfarming districts and for the construction of small cities. 
The use of land should be planned by the local governments who 
should also requisition, develop, and distribute it. Land 
distribution can adopt such forms as signed contracts, invited 
tenders, or auctioned. Different prices should be fixed on land 
used for different purposes, such as industrial, commercial, and 
residential purposes. Favorable land prices may be given to 
peasants trying to start industrial and commercial businesses in 
the new districts for planned development. Peasants who have 
settled down in small cities, and those who have changed their 
status into the nonfarming population, should be required to 
return the land that was previously contracted to them for 
farming production and the land contracts should be terminated. 
The farmland should be contracted to other people for 
management by the rural collectives. Peasants should be allowed 
to freely purchase commercial housing in small cities and towns 
without any restrictions. Economic means, such as requisitioning 
land, raising land use fees for township and town enterprises, 
or exchanging land, can be used to encourage and prompt the 
existing township and town enterprises which are scattered 
widely to move to certain well-planned districts or small cities 
to seek more concentrated development. 
  The social policy. Mass self-management organizations such 
as residents' committees should be set up in small cities, as 
should social service organizations providing community services 
and job placement services. The management of the permanent and 
migrating population should be strengthened. Various social 
security networks covering a broad scope of the population 
should be set up according to the characteristics of the small 
cities. The social security programs in small cities should be 
included in their overall socioeconomic development plans and 
should be joined by enterprises under all different ownership 
systems and by all workers employed under different conditions. 
  The financial policy. The income from selling the land use 
rights and the profits made from the real estate development 
projects in small cities should be used for the construction of 
small cities. The rate of taxes for maintaining urban utilities 
in small cities should be appropriately enhanced and the tax 
revenue should be completely used for the construction of 
infrastructural facilities in the same cities. Public utilities 
should be run as enterprises and those who make investment in 
public utilities should gain returns, as the public utilities 
are used on a paid basis. Residents moving into small cities 
should first pay a certain amount of construction fees and this 
money can be refunded in later years. The banks should give 
financial support to the construction of small cities by 
offering favorable terms. 
  Measures: Strengthening the planning, management, and 
guidance of the county (city) governments. The county-level 
(city-level) planning, management, and guidance should achieve 
the following ends; First, overcome the narrow-minded parochial 
mentality and remove the obstacles of rural administrative 
districts to the "combination." Second, make unified planning 
for the "combination" in the scope of a county (city), thus 
preventing the excessively scattered distribution of township 
and town enterprises and also preventing ill-coordinated 
"combination," which can lead to the appearance of excessive 
small industrial districts and small cities. 
  Being the upper authorities of the townships and towns, the 
unified planning and management by the county (city) governments 
can achieve better results.

<F P=106> [By reporter Jiao Ran (3542 3544)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Feb (XINHUA) -- Taking the floor at the 
recent "International Symposium on Rural Reform and Development 
in China in the 1990's," Li Qitie, chief of China's first 
"Peasant-Built City" -- Longgang Town in Wenzhou, Zhejiang -- 
proudly reported that his town, built by 6,000 peasants 10 years 
ago, now has a population of 135,000 people, its industrial 
output is approaching 2 billion yuan, and its secondary and 
tertiary industries employ over 10,000 peasants each year on 
average. 
  The 140 or so Chinese and foreign scholars at the meeting 
spoke highly of the town's great achievements, saying it is a 
path China can follow in urbanizing its rural areas, and that it 
is also a great way in which the hundreds of millions of 
peasants contribute to China's economic and social modernization 
during the course of reform and opening up. 
  According to the Ministry of Construction, ever since the 
adoption of the reform and opening up policy 15 years ago, 
14,458 small towns (including county seats and towns with 
established administrative organizations) with the necessary 
infrastructure -- such as water and power supply systems, roads, 
economic facilities, cultural and educational facilities, and 
health services -- have emerged in both the north and south of 
China, and in areas inside and outside the Great Wall, whereas 
there were only 2,894 such cities in 1979. According to the 
information, the total population of small towns in the country 
(not including county seats) has reached 150 million, including 
100 million people whose domiciles are not registered in these 
towns. Moreover, close to 40,000 new market towns (townships 
and villages where village enterprises are developed), which 
have services comparable to those in cities, have emerged in 
rural China. 
  Township and town enterprises have served as the powerful 
"afterburners" of this urbanization. As result of the tides of 
industrialization, which have gone on in coastal areas and in 
the suburbs of large and medium cities for more than a decade, 
factories, highways, telephones, banks, insurance service, 
modern commercial business, hospitals, schools, and various 
other things representing industrialization and urban 
civilization have appeared in these thriving small towns. This 
development is particularly conspicuous in the Zhu Jiang and 
Chang Jiang deltas, the Jiaodong peninsula, and the Liaodong 
peninsula. The historical opportunities created by reform and 
opening up have changed Zhongshan, Shunde, Nanhai, and Dongguan 
in Guangdong from ordinary small county seats in the past into 
medium size cities with modern industries, commerce, banking 
services, communications, telecommunications, medical health 
services, and cultural and educational facilities. Because their 
economic growth is higher than in the "four little dragons" of 
Asia, the development in these cities has been described as an 
economic miracle in China. Some townships and towns have also 
developed into new cities around these cities. Although 
administratively they are still called towns, these towns have 
long- distance telephone and express postal services, bus 
services, commercial centers, and other services peculiar to 
modern cities. Their urbanization has far exceeded the level of 
county seats in the past. 
  The urbanization in the Chang Jiang delta is comparable with 
that in the Zhu Jiang delta. Because modern industries and 
commercial businesses have put down roots, blossomed, and borne 
fruit in thousands of famous and ancient towns in areas south of 
the lower reaches of the Chang Jiang, the peasants there can now 
enjoy modern living without having to leave their hometowns. 
Moreover, these small towns' economic activities have reached 
beyond provincial boundaries. The industrial output yielded by 
Shengze Town in Jiangsu's Wujiang City has exceeded 5 billion 
yuan, and the town has become one of the four major silk 
capitals in China. The many highways criss-crossing the rural 
areas have linked these small but industrially and 
agriculturally developed towns with Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, 
Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yangzhou, Shaoxing, and other large and 
medium cities, forming new urban belts in which rural and urban 
areas supporting each other in their quest for development. 
  What surprises people is that, because of the 
industrialization in rural areas, many sparsely populated 
hamlets in the past have now become new towns on the map of the 
republic. For example, Bashan in Shandong's Zibo City used to 
be a small village with only 1,000 or so villagers prior to 
reform. Its per capita income was only a little more than 100 
yuan. Now the village has a new name -- Wantongde Corporation, 
Ltd. -- and the industrial output yielded by its 27 factories 
and 12 foreign-funded enterprises has exceeded 500 million yuan. 
In this village, there is the Wanjie Hospital, a world-class 
hospital built with Chinese and U.S. funds, secondary vocational 
schools, shopping malls, and guesthouses. Some scholars call 
these places -- which are villages in name but small towns in 
fact -- "village-class towns," and there are tens of thousands 
of such "village-class towns" in China. 
  The economic development in ancient towns with relatively 
developed communications services in Northwest and Southwest 
China has also been revitalized as result of reform and opening 
up. Fenglingdu by the Huang He and Linxia on the loess plateau 
have again distinguished themselves as ancient towns. Thanks to 
thriving border trade, small towns located along the China's 
long borders have also found their opportunities for development. 
  Economic experts say that, as peasants have created for 
themselves the opportunities and space for development, they 
have blazed a practical way for China to create jobs for surplus 
laborers in rural areas, to modernize agricultural production, 
and to develop the rural market. 
  The transfer of surplus manpower is a formidable issue which 
rural areas in China have to confront in their economic 
development. According to estimates, by the end of this century, 
over 100 million surplus laborers will be transferred from the 
agricultural sector. The development of small towns not only can 
help improve the environment for the development of town and 
township enterprises and accelerate the modernization process of 
the rural economy, but also can alleviate the pressure created 
by the flow of peasants into large and medium cities. If each 
small town can absorb 2,000 peasants over the next five years, 
50,000 towns can absorb 100 million people. Thus, the state is 
attaching great importance to the development of small towns and 
has started planning to reform the system governing domicile 
registration in small towns to facilitate the hundreds of 
millions of peasants to work and do business in cities.

Villages, Townships, Towns, and Farms by the author Chen

"Summarize Experience and Set Examples"] 
  [Text] After the founding of New China, especially after 
the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the 
extensive rural grass-roots organizations in China, namely 
villages, townships, towns, and agricultural, forestry, animal, 
and fish farms, earnestly carried out the basic line and rural 
principles and policies of the party, took care of both material 
and spiritual civilizations, and led the masses in deepening 
reform, developing the economy, and getting rich together. A 
batch of townships, towns, and farms achieving rapid economic 
development, that are making hundreds of millions and even 
billions of yuan per year, has appeared. These advanced models 
have written magnificent praise of the reform and opening up 
policies of the party, and set new examples for the further 
development of rural China. 
  China is an ancient country with a long history of 
civilization. The formation and development of villages, 
townships, towns, and farms in China went through a long 
process. According to relevant historical material, villages 
formed during the Paleolithic period at the beginning of 
primitive society. The original meaning was "several families 
facing the water naturally forming a village." In order to hunt 
animals and prevent invasion from outside, primitive groups 
settled around forest streams, and that formed the prototype of 
villages. After man turned from hunting to animal husbandry, 
farming, and a settled life, numerous villages appeared. 
  Townships and towns are the result of village development. 
With the development of productive forces, a surplus was 
produced and slave society farms appeared. The location of some 
large slave owners became the political, economic, and cultural 
center of surrounding villages, i.e., the township. As the 
grass-roots administrative institution, the township can be 
traced back to the pre-Qin ancient book Zhouli [a Confucian 
classic]. But as real grass-roots administrative institutions, 
townships germinated during the Spring and Autumn Period, took 
shape during the Warring States Period, and reached their final 
form during the Qin Dynasty. The town is the result of the 
division of labor between villages and the development of a 
market economy, and appeared much later than the township. As a 
state administrative unit, towns first started during the reign 
of Northern Wei Emperor Xiao Wen Di. But what can really be 
called the prototype of the town did not appear until the Tang 
to Ming and Qing period. Agricultural, forestry, and animal 
farms germinated during the early years of the Republic of 
China, and large numbers of farms were set up after liberation. 
  China currently has 804,153 administrative villages and 
58,185 township and towns. Among these, 43,660 are townships, 
2,421 are national minority townships, 11,882 are towns, and 222 
are national minority towns. There are 2,149 state-owned farms, 
4,212 forestry farms, and 8,200 state-owned and collectively 
owned animal farms. With reform and opening up, a batch of star 
villages, townships, towns, and farms appeared. According to 
1992 statistics, the number of villages with total industrial 
and agricultural output value exceeding 100 million yuan reached 
430. Among them, the output of 10 villages exceeded 500 million 
yuan, and that of 70 exceeded 200 million yuan. There were 
4,255 townships and towns whose total industrial and 
agricultural output value exceeded 100 million yuan. Among them, 
55 exceeded 1 billion yuan and 10 exceeded 2 billion yuan. 
There were 125 agricultural farms with total output exceeding 
100 million yuan, among which 9 exceeded 500 million yuan. 
There was one forestry farm whose total output exceeded 100 
million yuan. 
  Although these star villages, townships, towns, and farms 
are 
still a minority among all the villages, townships, and towns, 
and their proportion greatly differs in different places--among 
villages they only occupy 0.00053, among township and towns they 
occupy 0.073, among agricultural farms they occupy 0.049, among 
forestry farms they occupy 0.024, and among animal farms they 
occupy 0.018-- however, they are like glistening pearls 
distributed all over China, shining on the extensive land, 
attracting and encouraging the hearts of 800 million farmers, 
and making 300 million city dwellers look at them in a new light. 
  The reform and opening up of more than a decade is but a 
moment in the long river of time. What has enabled these star 
villages, townships, towns, and farms to take an early start, to 
cross over the stage of having enough to eat and wear and 
advance toward the well-off stage, and to climb into the 
international economic arena? What characteristics and secrets 
do they have? The book Shining Stars has selected 
over 500 villages, townships, and towns, and over 200 farms. 
The book has approximately 2.7 million characters (with over 
1,500 photographs). All those selected are the best in current 
reform, opening up, and the construction of two civilizations. 
Their practice answers the questions people are concerned about. 
  These star villages, townships, towns, and farms basically 
have the following characteristics: 1) They grasp opportunities 
with an emancipated mind, and create miracles in pioneering and 
advancing; 2) they rely on their own resources for survival, and 
work hard to seek development; 3) they begin from reality and 
come up with their own road for developing the local economy; 4) 
they respect knowledge and talent, and become rich by relying on 
science and technology; 5) they take the market as their 
orientation, adjust the structure of their industries and 
products in a timely manner, and take the road of 
industrializing the countryside. 
  Another characteristic of these star villages, townships, 
towns, and farms is that they do not blindly seek output value 
and speed. This point is very important. To develop township 
enterprises one must forcefully push forward technological 
reform and scientific management and develop brand-name 
good-quality products and products with high added-value and 
high-technology content--products that can yield high foreign 
exchange earnings. One must pay attention to product quality and 
strictly ban fake and shoddy goods. On no account must one seek 
product value and speed blindly. On the contrary, one must 
actually raise economic efficiency. These they have all done 
well. They have also strengthened the building of the party, 
and given full play to the function of grass-roots party 
organizations as a fighting force and the exemplary vanguard 
function of party members. The key to the success of star 
villages, townships, towns, and farms is in having a good 
leading body, especially a good leader. It is because they have 
a large number of hardworking, self-sacrificing socialist 
grass-roots leaders that these formerly poverty-stricken 
villages, townships, towns, and farms are able to emerge in 
intensive market competition, under the heavy onslaught of the 
commodity economy, and first realize "well-off" standards and 
get rich, becoming brilliant stars in the land of China. 
  Sparks of fire can spread all over a grassland. We wish for 
the old star villages, townships, towns, and farms to continue 
to progress, and we hope more new stars will appear!

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Szu Liang (2448 5328): "Transnational </F>
Corporations Speed Up Investment in Mainland China"] 
  [Text] Since China shifted the focus of its policy for 
attracting foreign investment to the fields of energy, 
transportation, telecommunications, and new materials, many 
famous transnational corporations became more active in the 
investment market on the Chinese mainland, and this has 
quickened the pace of convergence between the Chinese and world 
economies. 
  According to reports from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, 
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Ningbo, many transnational corporations 
have invested in local basic industry projects and high-tech 
projects. Last year, more than 10 transnational corporations 
launched investment projects in Beijing, and large projects 
exceeding $10 million each numbered more than 200. Shanghai has 
signed more than 200 project agreements with more than 120 
transnational corporations. One-third of the world's 100 
largest corporations have made investments in Shanghai. The 
investment by transnational corporations in Ningpo exceeded $6 
billion, and large projects exceeding $10 million each numbered 
more than 40. The number and size of investment projects in 
Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen also has increased 
substantially. 
  In recent years, hundreds of internationally famous 
transnational corporations made investments on the Chinese 
mainland. These include Motorola, General Motors, IBM, Xerox, 
Concord [xie he 0588 0735] Johnson and Johnson, Exxon, and 
Morgan [mo gen 2302 2704], of the United states; Unilever and 
Pilkington Brothers [pi er jin dun 4122 1422 6855 7319], of 
Britain; Volkswagen and Simens, of Germany; Mitsubishi, Mitsui, 
Sony, Seibu, Ito-chu, and Kumagai Gumi, of Japan; Bell, of 
Belgium; Phillips, of the Netherlands; and Zhengda [2973 1129], 
of Thailand; as well as some transnational corporations based in 
Taiwan and Hong Kong. The transnational corporations that have 
taken quick action first set up some small and 
intermediate-sized enterprises and also sought new opportunities 
for major investment projects. Many large corporations have 
planned to launch major investment projects in the fields of 
petroleum, car making, the chemical industry, and shipping, and 
have worked out long- or intermediate-term investment plans. 
For example, the three large oil companies -- Texaco, Shell, 
and Exxon -- have participated in offshore oil development 
projects in the East China Sea. A U.S. corporation planned to 
invest 10 billion yuan in China's petrochemical industrial, 
radio communications, and shipping projects. Japan's Mitsubishi 
Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and the U.S. 
Boeing Corporation have cooperated with China's aviation 
industries in manufacturing YSX passenger planes. Hong Kong's 
Hutchison Whampoa has invested over 10 billion yuan in 
developing Shenzhen's Yantian Port and Shanghai's container 
terminal. 
  The transnational corporations are making huge long-term 
investments in China mainly because they are attracted by the 
tremendous market potential and the lasting economic charm of 
the Chinese mainland. In the past 15 years, although foreign 
investors have signed investment agreements with a total value 
of $200 billion, the foreign-funded enterprises still account 
for a very small proportion of China's national economy. The 
yearly foreign investment accounts for only 2.2 percent of 
China's aggregate investment. On the other hand, the cumulate 
investment made by transnational corporations in China accounts 
for only 1 percent of their overseas investment. At present, 
the more than 50 U.S.-based transnational corporations that have 
made investments in China account for only one-tenth of the more 
than 500 transnational corporations in the United States. China 
still needs funds and technologies in many fields of 
development, and still has great potential for attracting 
foreign capital. Transnational corporations may have a vast 
market in China. 
  Since last year, in order to strive to join GATT and to 
converge with international practice, the Chinese Government has 
unified the foreign exchange market, and has partly opened 
China's domestic market. The policy for attracting foreign 
investment also has been gradually adjusted and perfected in 
order to attract transnational corporations to set up their 
Asian or Asia-Pacific regional headquarters inside the Chinese 
mainland and to encourage foreign investors to invest in 
high-tech and capital-intensive projects. Foreign companies now 
are allowed to set up investment corporations and joint-stock 
companies in China. The scope of opening up to foreign 
investment also has been broadened. All this has opened up 
various new channels for transnational corporations to invest in 
China.

<F P=106> [By Qiu Qi: "Medicine Firms Must Gear Up for Competition"] </F>
  [Text] China's pharmaceutical industry will have to gear 
up if it is to compete with foreign companies on the domestic 
and world markets, according to the Ministry of Public Health. 
  Imports totalled $600 million last year, up by $100 million 
on the previous year and almost twice 1991's figure, according 
to ministry statistics. 
  And China's re-entry into the Gatt (General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade) will bring a lot more sophisticated foreign 
medicines onto the home market in direct competition with 
domestic products, said the ministry. 
  Imported medicine accounted for 7-10 per cent of the 
domestic 
medicine market last year. And joint venture products claimed a 
35 percent share. 
  "Imported medicine may bring in products that domestic 
plants 
cannot manufacture and enhance our pharmaceutical technology," 
the ministry spokesman said. 
  Over 2,000 foreign medicines have been submitted for 
official 
approval since the registration system for imported medicine was 
set up in 1987. 
  About 400 applications have been approved so far. 
  "Joint ventures have played a big role in increasing China's 
medicine production," the spokesman said. 
  Xian-Janssen Pharmaceutical Limited, China's biggest 
pharmaceutical joint venture, reported sales of 820 million yuan 
($94.3 million) last year, 150 million yuan ($17 million) up on 
1992. 
  The figure is almost that of China's largest domestic 
company, North China Pharmaceutical Plant, which reported 1 
billion yuan ($115 million) sales last year. 
  About 60 per cent of China's one thousand plus joint 
ventures 
are engaged in medicine production. 
  Most of the pharmaceuticals imported were for the treatment 
of blood and digestive system diseases cancer and everyday 
infections. Antiinfection medicine accounted for 30 percent of 
imports. 
  China's pharmaceutical output hit 72 billion yuan ($8.3 
billion) last year, a 13 per cent increase over 1992. 
  Medicine products accounted for a solid 70 percent of total 
output. 
  Exports from China's largest State run medicine trader, 
China 
National Medicines and Health Care Products Import and Export 
Corporation, reached $78 million last year.

<F P=106> [By Pang Jianjing (1690 1696 0079): "China's Civil Aviation </F>
Transport Network Takes Shape"] 
  [Text] Three major civil aviation groups in China -- the 
Eastern, Southern, and International Airline Groups -- were 
successively founded by the end of last year, thus marking the 
formation of our country's civil aviation transport network, 
which was started with the founding of the China Southwest 
Airline on 15 December 1987. Up to the end of 1993, there were 
more than 340 registered large and medium aircraft (each with 
over 100 seats). 
  The greatest changes brought by the initial formation of our 
country's civil aviation transport network are the transition 
from a sellers' market to a buyers' market in passenger air 
transportation. By the end of 1986, the number of passenger 
seats provided by the mainland civil aviation industry exceeded 
15,400; there were 288 domestic and international air lines; and 
the total mileage served reached 1.548 billion metric ton km. 
At that time, passengers found it very difficult to buy air 
tickets, and some did not hesitate to buy second-hand tickets 
from ticket scalpers at high prices. By 1993, the number of 
passenger seats provided by the mainland civil aviation industry 
exceeded 50,000, an increase of 230 percent over that of 1986. 
There were over 610 domestic and international airlines, and 
the total mileage served reached 5.2 billion metric ton km. 
Today, passengers can easily buy air tickets, and sometimes 
they can choose from a number of flights. According to 
statistics, the average passenger seat utilization rate in 1986 
was 89.7 percent, whereas the average passenger seat utilization 
rate in 1993 was 72.4 percent. The formation of a buyers' 
market led to the real beginning of competition among various 
airlines. The prime concern of safety, high-quality services, 
flights that depart and arrive on schedule, and replacing the 
fleet with new models of aircraft are important chips which 
airlines can use to solicit passengers. 
  The rapid development of airlines also caused some 
difficulties and problems: The quantity of large aircraft is 
increasing too quickly and there is a lack of pilots, 
particularly high-quality pilot trainers; there is not enough 
time for technological development due to frequent refits; and 
the standard of service provided by the ground crew and aviation 
control personnel demands prompt improvement -- the whole 
contingent must be strengthened. The departments and leaders 
concerned have attached great importance to these problems.

productive scrap metal purchasing must receive the approval of 
the department responsible for the business, apply to the public 
security organ of the local county people's government for a 
special trade permit, register with the department in charge of 
industry and commerce at the same level, and collect a special 
trade permit and business license, before it can start business. 
  Any self-employed industrial and commercial operator 
planning 
to do business in nonproductive scrap metal purchasing must

<F P=106> ["Random Talk on Rural Economy" column by staff reporter Xia </F>
Jun (1115 8823): "Significance of the Reform of Residence 
Registration System in Small Cities and Towns--Departments 
Concerned Are Working Out Specific Methods of Operation"] 
  [Text] The following remarks were in the "Decision on Some 
Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure," which was approved by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th Central Party Committee: "We 
should...gradually reform the residence registration system in 
small cities and towns, allow peasants to work in factories or 
do business in small cities and towns, develop rural tertiary 
industries, and promote the transfer of a rural surplus labor 
force to other fields of endeavor." These few words are of 
vital strategic significance to accelerating the process of 
urbanization in rural areas in our country. 
  As indicated by the history of the development of modern 
society, urbanization is a worldwide historical trend. In the 
early 19th century, the urban population merely accounted for 
three percent of the total population of the world, and the 
figure was elevated to over 14 percent in the early 20th century 
and to 42 percent in the 1980's. According to the forecast of 
concerned UN organizations, by the end of this century, 50 
percent of the world population will live in cities. However, 
the level of urbanization in our country (merely 28 percent or 
so) is relatively low in the world; it is not only lower than 
that of developed countries (80 to 90 percent) but also lower 
than that of developing countries (40 percent). 
  Compared with non-agricultural industrial development, the 
development of cities and towns in our country is also quite 
backward. As far as the GNP of our country is concerned, the 
proportion of non-agricultural industries increased from around 
40 percent in the early days after our country's founding to 
around 75 percent in 1992, but basically 80 percent of the 
population still lived in rural areas and there was hardly any 
change in this pattern. As far as rural areas are concerned, 
the proportion of non-agricultural output value to the gross 
output value of rural society increased from 30 percent in 1978 
to 60 percent in 1992. However, the scattered rural population 
did not decrease, rather more and more people live in rural 
areas. 
  Concerned experts point out that backwardness of the process 
of urbanization in our country had caused three adverse effects. 
  First, it is impossible to have normal development of 
tertiary industry and to have economic benefits on a large scale 
which should be brought about by a large scale of economic 
development. In other words, it is impossible to merely promote 
the development of tertiary industry while leaving aside the 
process of accelerated urbanization because such a move will 
cause even more new problems. 
  Second, apart from bringing prosperity and wealth to the 
rural economy, the rise of township and town enterprises also 
causes new "rural diseases," which is markedly reflected by 
over-scattered distribution of township and town industries. In 
1992, there were 2,079 township and town enterprises throughout 
the country with more than 1,900 of them scattered in natural 
villages. Due to over-scattered distribution of township and 
town enterprises, there are three kinds of uneconomic phenomena, 
that is, uneconomic use of land, uneconomic scale of production, 
and uneconomic freight, and it is unfavorable to devoting every 
effort to tackling pollution and repetitive low-quality 
construction, thus causing great waste of resources and funds. 
The greater the development of township and town industries 
under the condition of backward urbanization, the greater the 
waste. 
  Third, the ability of our industrial structure, in the 
process of readjustment, to absorb surplus agricultural labor is 
weakened. Data indicate that with rapid development of township 
and town enterprises in our country in recent years, the ability 
to absorb surplus agricultural labor has declined rather than 
improved. 
  The pace of construction of small cities and towns has been 
accelerating since we started implementing the policy of reform 
and opening up more than a decade ago. Peasants in many places 
who have become rich set off an upsurge of "urban construction," 
thus leading to the emergence of a number of "peasant cities" 
which resemble the one built up by peasants in Longgang Town, 
Cangnan County, Zhejiang. A large number of peasants have gone 
to cities and towns to work and run businesses there. Up to 
1993, a total of 116 million peasants worked in township and 
town enterprises. However, due to the restrictions of the 
residence registration system, peasants who have gone to towns 
and cities for work and business still belong to the category of 
"agricultural residence," thus forming a marginal strata who 
live in both cities and townships, but are "neither city 
dwellers nor peasants." Their registered residence is in 
villages, which are their ancestral homes, and they contract 
rural land, but they work and spend their daily life in cities 
and towns. They have means of production and daily necessities 
in villages as well as in cities and towns. On the one hand, 
they are not in the mode of or not capable of engaging in 
agricultural production; but, on the other hand, they cannot 
have the same identity and enjoy the same treatment granted to 
residents in cities and towns. 
  We originally divided people's registered residences into 
two categories, that is, "agricultural residence" and "non- 
agricultural residence." The main purpose was to control the 
size of large cities and tried to decrease the number of people 
eating commodity grain. Hence, "non-agricultural residence" 
became the first gate of controlling the influx of peasants into 
cities and towns. In the past, this gate really played a role 
of control because even if you entered a city or town, you could 
not buy food, find a job, rent a house, and your children could 
not enroll in any nursery or school if you did not have 
registered residence in cities and towns. Once you were 
discovered, you would be repatriated to your village. At that 
time, apart from taking risks in daily life, peasants who went 
to cities had to take political risks and bear the pressure of 
the media. However, this kind of situation has changed a lot 
since we started implementing the policy of reform and opening 
up more than a decade ago. Peasants without registered 
residences in cities and towns can also buy food, find jobs, 
rent houses in cities. As long as they pay a certain amount of 
"support fees," their children can also enroll in nurseries and 
schools. Moreover, the media is more and more lenient towards 
peasants entering cities. In reality, under the present social 
and economic circumstances, the residence registration system 
must be revised accordingly. 
  It is better to dredge a river than to block it. The defects 
of the current residence registration system, which are more and 
more clearly exposed, have become a severe barrier hindering 
reasonable mobility of talent and labor. The fact that people 
cannot select their places of residence according to their own 
needs of production and management has, for a long time, 
hindered development of many small cities and towns with 
superiority in location, and this is one of the reasons why our 
country lags behind in the process of urbanization. At present, 
most of the provinces and municipalities have abolished the 
system of state monopoly for the marketing of grain for city 
dwellers, thus creating extremely important conditions for 
reforming the existing residence registration system. The 
"Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central 
Party Committee addressed the issue of "gradual reform of the 
residence registration system in small cities and towns" and it 
was a timely move which seized the opportunity. "Gradual reform 
of the residence registration system in small cities and towns" 
will help smash the old system which broke up cities and 
townships, arouse peasants' enthusiasm for living and running 
business in cities, and converge it with the potential of funds 
owned by peasants to build a new style of small cities and 
towns, develop tertiary industry, and accelerate the process of 
urbanization in accordance with the pattern of a market economy. 
  The ministries of public security, construction, and 
agriculture, and the State Commission for Restructuring the 
Economy are investigating and studying the concrete method of 
reforming the residence registration system in small cities and 
towns, and certain concrete issues are being discussed. 
However, they already have a consensus on major principles, 
that is, they should take the method of vigorously implementing 
the reform and achieving goals step by step. The final 
objective is to wipe out the difference between "agricultural 
residence" and "non-agricultural residence" and to remove the 
barrier which hinders reasonable mobility for people in cities 
and in townships. However, this is a relatively long process of 
social and economic development, we cannot be impatient for 
success. As proved by historical lessons, no matter what 
undertakings we engage in, it does not work if there is only a 
sense of urgency. We must also have a down-to-earth style of 
work, otherwise haste will make waste.

<F P=106> [By Xie Liangjun: "A Ringing Success: Cellular Phones </F>
Catching On"] 
  [Text] In Beijing, one must pay 20,000 to 30,000 yuan 
($2,300 to $3,450) to buy a cellular phone at a 
telecommunications business centre. 
  On the black market, one must pay as much as 40,000 yuan 
(about $4,600) for one. Moreover, "back door" channels must be 
used to get this mobile phone as soon as possible. 
  But such hurdles aren't stopping a growing number of people 
from planning to buy a mobile telephone, a symbol of affluence 
and status. 
  According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of 
Posts 
and Telecommunications, by the end of last year China had 
638,000 mobile telephone users, 2.7 times the number in 1992. 
  Sources in the ministry say that in 1993 alone, the number 
of 
mobile phone subscribers grew by 461,000. 
  The ministry, encouraged by spectacular expansion of the 
whole postal and telecoms network, has revised its 
previously-outlined development targets for mobile telephone 
service. 
  According to the new targets, the number of mobile phone 
users will rise to between 900,000 and 1 million by 1995, 
instead of the previously projected 500,000. This figure will 
jump to between 4.5 million and million by the end of the 
century. 
  The explosive growth in mobile telephone services, spurred 
by 
the country's rapid economic growth, has created much excitement 
among overseas manufacturers. They know that about 90 percent 
of China's mobile phones and related equipment are imported. 
  The market is now dominated by products made by such 
telecoms 
giants as Motorola Inc of the United States, and NEC Corp and 
Mitsubishi of Japan. 
  To meet this burgeoning demand the ministry is encouraging 
local telecoms administrations to expand their mobile phone 
networks. 
  In Beijing, the mobile telephone system is being expanded 
markedly a process that should be completed in June. 
  An official with the Beijing Telecommunications 
Administration said the plan is to accommodate an additional 
60,000 subscribers and extend coverage to suburban counties. To 
accomplish this, a mobile phone switching system will be 
installed and 16 base stations will be built. 
  By the end of last year, Beijing had 31,563 mobile phone 
users, compared with about 11,000 the year before. 
  Meanwhile, the ministry has also urged local authorities to 
set up regional "roaming services" for mobile phone users. 
"Roaming service" allows a mobile phone subscriber from one 
region to use a cellular phone when travelling to other regions. 
  Some provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have 
established such services in major cities and towns. 
  Zhejiang in East China is the only province to have a 
complete mobile phone network. Its system serves over 60,000 
users in all of its 74 counties and cities. 
  According to the People's Postal and Telecommunications 
News, 
by mid-February automatic roaming service will be available in 
the Yangtze River Delta region.

<F P=106> [By Jin Man: "Unity Urged in Policies on Business"] </F>
  [Text] With China coming closer to reentering the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the central government 
has renewed its call for local authorities to stop granting 
freewheeling financial breaks to foreign investors. 
  A high-ranking government official said it is a top priority 
to unify China's trade policies this year in line with the 
demand of Gatt, the world trade body. 
  Over the past few years confused foreign investors have 
complained about the discrepancies between central and local 
government policies. 
  Because of this uncertainty, a number of potential investors 
have shied away from the Chinese market. On the other hand, 
many foreign businesses have taken advantage of generously 
preferential local policies to make piles of money. 
  "We wouldn't like to see either of these cases in the 
future," said the senior government official, who asked not to 
be named. 
  China is expected to resume its contracting party status in 
Gatt by 1995, but when it does it will be barred from allowing 
policies to vary from region to region. 
  The government official said China is prepared to unify 
policies soon for the same industries, but not for regions. 
  "We will convert a certain amount of special economic zones 
to free trade areas, which are accepted internationally," the 
official said, adding that all other regions will enjoy equal 
treatment in the same commercial sectors. 
  The change will most benefit China's vast inland regions, 
which have trailed behind the coastal areas in attracting 
foreign investment. 
  Wu Yi, Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, 
noted that although foreign investment last year grew faster in 
the hinterlands, the bulk was still concentrated in the coastal 
regions. 
  Wu said more than 120 countries and regions had invested in 
China by the end of 1993. They focused on energy, light 
industry, electronics, machinery, textiles and garments, 
metallurgy, building materials and real estate. 
  Foreign businesses have also sought a larger share of 
China's 
service markets, which are nowhere near as developed as those in 
the West.

<F P=106> [Report: "Reforms in Foreign Trade System Have Gone One </F>
Step Further -- Bidding for Export Quotas Held Twice a Year"] 
  [Text] As part of the move to reform its foreign trade 
system, China will invite bidding for the export quotas on some 
commodities. The bidding is opened to both domestic and foreign 
firms, as long as they are a member of a related import and 
export association or foreign investment society. Bidding 
methods for these export quotas will be announced shortly. 
  Commodities for which these methods provide an export quota 
are those announced by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC]. The quotas will be granted to 
enterprises that are members of business associations. Firms 
that are not members of any business association are not 
eligible to apply. 
  Other provisions of these methods are: 
  MOFTEC will be responsible for supervising and guiding the 
bidding. It determines the commodities to which bidding is 
applicable and will set up a special bidding committee to take 
charge of bidding for commodity export quotas. 
  The bidding committee will be comprised of MOFTEC leading 
officials and related import and export associations. Specific 
work for export quota bidding will be done by related import and 
export associations. The bidding committee will set up a 
commodity bidding office at the related association to handle 
day-to-day affairs. 
  The number of biddings will depend on each specific 
commodity. In principle, bidding will be held twice a year, each 
session one quarter ahead of the effective date. The bidding 
committee will designate specific news media to announce bidding 
notices. 
  According to the provisions, import and export companies 
with 
MOFTEC-issued foreign trade licenses and membership in a related 
import and export association or a foreign investment society, 
manufacturing enterprises (limited to self-manufactured 
products), and foreign-invested enterprises (limited to 
self-manufactured products) are eligible to apply. 
  According to the provisions, firms participating in bidding 
must fill out a "bidding application form" issued by the bidding 
office, and mail it in a sealed envelope or have it delivered to 
the bidding office. The day the bidding office receives the 
application is counted as the date of receipt. 
  Names of the enterprises awarded quotas will be announced by 
news media appointed by the bidding committee. 
  Provisions also specify that with the concurrence of the 
bidding committee, the bidding office reserves the power to 
revoke the bidding right for the following year of any 
enterprise that fails to make use of, transfer, or return the 
quota awarded it within a specified time. Quota-winning 
enterprises will be deprived of their right to bid for export 
quotas in the following year if it is found and established as 
true that they have transferred the awarded quota to another 
party without permission from the bidding office. If the export 
price of the commodities of an quota-awarded enterprise is lower 
than the coordinated price set by a related business 
association, the enterprise will be barred from bidding for that 
commodity for three years. 
  Regarding improving and perfecting voluntary quota 
management, quotas for a single market will come under a 
regional quota management scheme for individual countries, which 
in turn is subordinate to a global quota distribution plan.

  [Text] Beijing, February 13 (XINHUA) -- A plan for 
comprehensively expoiting the resources of the Pearl River 
Valley in South China's Guangdong Province has been approved by 
the State Council, the "PEOPLE'S DAILY" reported today. 
  As a major waterway in South China, Pearl River consists 
mainly of four water systems: the Western River, Northern River, 
Eastern River and Delta Zhuhe River with annual flowing volume 
ranking second in the country, after the Chang Jiang River, the 
country's longest. 
  The river constitutes an important hydro-power production 
base in the country.

  [Text] The regional committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] held a Lunar New Year 
tea party in Nanning on 8 February. The tea party was presided 
over by Chen Huiguang, chairman of the regional CPPCC committee, 
and attended by regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin; 
Liu Mingzu, deputy secretary of the regional party committee and 
chairman of the regional people's congress standing committee; 
Ding Tingmo, deputy secretary of the regional party committee; 
as well as members of the regional party committee standing 
committee; regional people's congress leaders; regional people's 
government leaders; leaders of the regional CPPCC committee; 
regional higher people's court leaders; regional people's 
procuratorate leaders; regional military district leaders; 
leaders of Guangxi-based PLA Air Force units; Nanning-based 
former chairmen of the regional CPPCC committee; Nanning-based 
veteran comrades, National People's Congress deputies, and CPPCC 
National Committee members; persons in charge of the regional 
branches of various democratic parties, the regional federation 
of industry and commerce, and regional people's organizations; 
persons in charge of the regional departments concerned; persons 
in charge of the Nanning Prefectural CPC Committee, people's 
government, and CPPCC committee, and the Nanning City CPC 
Committee, people's government, and CPPCC committee; and 
representatives of all walks of life. 
  Regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin delivered a 
speech at the tea party in which he stated: Over the past year, 
we in Guangxi have actively and comprehensively implemented the 
spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the spirit of both 
the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; seized each and every opportunity to speed up reform 
and development under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and 
scored noticeable results in all fields of endeavors. 
  Comrade Zhao Fulin stressed: We have scored these 
achievements mainly because we have united as one and worked 
hard under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council. The CPPCC organizations at all levels in Guangxi 
also have made invaluable contributions to the region by 
conscientiously carrying out political consultation and 
democratic supervision. In addition, the regional branches of 
various democratic parties, the regional federation of industry 
and commerce, as well as patriotic figures without party 
affiliation in the region also have actively played their 
respective roles and done much fruitful work to this end. 
  After expressing thanks to all comrades concerned on behalf 
of the regional party committee and people's government, Comrade 
Zhao Fulin noted that the year 1994 is a crucial one in which 
Guangxi will strive to accelerate reform and development, and he 
called for concentrating on the following five aspects of work 
in 1994: 1) To seize each and every excellent opportunity to 
speed up reform; 2) To continually readjust industrial structure 
and accelerate economic growth; 3) To continually make 
painstaking efforts to build a link between the Southwest and 
coastal areas, and further expand opening up to the outside 
world; 4) To safeguard social and political stability, and 
protect and mobilize enthusiasm among the broad masses of 
people; 5) To further step up party building and clean 
government building. 
  Comrade Zhao Fulin expressed the hope that the CPPCC 
organizations, the branches of various democratic parties, and 
the federations of industry and commerce at all levels across 
the region will continue in 1994, as they have always done, to 
support, cooperate with, and assist the party committees and 
people's governments at all levels and make more contributions 
to Guangxi's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization 
drive. 
  Wu Keqing, vice chairman of the regional CPPCC committee, 
delivered a speech at the tea party on behalf of the regional 
branches of various democratic parties and the regional 
federation of industry and commerce.

<F P=106> ["Hainan Strengthens the Administration of Import </F>
Commodities in the Realm of Circulation"] 
  [Text] Haikou, 8 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- To counter 
the existence of fake and poor-quality import commodities in the 
realm of circulation at present, the Hainan Provincial 
Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export 
Commodities, the Hainan Provincial Administration for Industry 
and Commerce, and the Hainan Provincial Consumer Committee a few 
days ago jointly enacted the "Method for the Administration of 
Import Commodities in the Realm of Circulation in Hainan," which 
will be implemented beginning 1 May 1994. 
  The stipulations of the Administrative Method are as 
follows: 
  -- All commodities imported by selling units (including 
commodities imported through border trade at ports) must be 
reported to and checked by or registered with organs of 
commodity inspection in Hainan within prescribed time, with such 
documents as contracts, invoices, packing lists, bills of lading 
shown. 
  Import commodities related to security and public health 
must 
be imported according to law in China. 
  Regarding import commodities that must be checked according 
to law by commodity inspection organs, no one is allowed to sell 
them without prior checking or without getting a pass at the 
inspection. 
  -- For selling units that directly import the following nine 
electromechanical products: automobiles, motorcycles, 
motorcycle engines, television sets, refrigerators, air 
conditioners, refrigerating compressors, air conditioning 
compressors, and kinescopes, it is necessary to produce valid 
"import commodity safety permits" provided by suppliers, and 
signed and issued by the PRC State Administration for the 
Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, and to bear the 
"CCIB" mark authorized by the State Administration for the 
Inspection of Import and Export Commodities. Commodities 
arriving in Hainan must be reported to and checked by commodity 
inspection organs promptly. The "commodity inspection label" 
will be issued after getting a pass in the commodity inspection. 
Only when the label is put on the outside package can a 
commodity be sold to consumers in the market according to 
relevant laws and regulations stipulated by industrial and 
commercial administrative departments. 
  -- When producing invoices of import commodities sold, 
selling units should state clearly the countries of origin, 
specifications, and models of commodities. 
  -- Commodity inspection organs and industrial and commercial 
administrative departments spot check, supervise, and administer 
import commodities in the realm of circulation according to law 
and can spot check, at any time, import commodities to be sold 
in the realm of circulation, but selling units must never, under 
whatever grounds, reject the spot check.

  [Text] The provincial government yesterday [31 January] 
held its fifth plenary session at which it summed up last year's 
work, made arrangements for this year's work, and spelled out 
several major tasks for present and immediate future. 
  Provincial Governor Ma Zhongchen delivered a speech at the 
fifth plenary session entitled: "Now That Reform and 
Development Tasks Have Been Outlined, It Is Imperative To Focus 
on Key Aspects and To Ensure Smooth Work." In his speech, 
Governor Ma Zhongchen stated: In 1993, Henan witnessed 
comprehensive national economic and social development, mainly 
because, first, we further emancipated our minds, and expanded 
reform and opening up after studying Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, as well as "The CPC 
Central Committee Decision on Several Questions on Building a 
Socialist Market Economy Structure." Second, we succeeded in 
securing fast-paced national economic growth across the 
province, in raising the province's GNP growth rate to a level 
higher than the country's average, and in lowering the 
province's natural population growth rate to a level lower than 
the country's average, as well as in maintaining social 
stability. Third, we implemented and carried out a series of 
measures formulated by the central authorities to strengthen 
macroeconomic regulation and control; concentrated on tackling 
existing problems; made no complaints, accusations, or disputes; 
refrained from taking the road back; and succeeded in mobilizing 
enthusiasm on the part of localities and departments. Fourth, we 
made more investment than in any single previous year. Fifth, we 
scored noticeable results in combating corruption and 
professional malpractices. 
  Provincial Governor Ma Zhongchen outlined the following 12 
major tasks for 1994: 1) To deepen reform and to further 
liberate and develop rural productive forces with a view to 
increasing peasants' income -- this being a task of great 
significance; 2) To expeditiously establish a modern enterprise 
system with a view to comprehensively raising economic 
efficiency; 3) To rapidly foster and develop an essential market 
for the means of production, and to continually develop and 
perfect a commodity market; 4) To comprehensively push forward 
reform of the financial and revenue systems, with an eye to 
steadily increasing financial revenue; 5) To actively press 
ahead with banking system reform and make unremitting efforts to 
raise funds and secure the free flow of funds; 6) To carry on 
reform of the planning and investment systems, and to see that 
each and every key project is built on schedule; 7) To speed up 
foreign trade system reform and expand opening up to the outside 
world; 8) To actively support and develop the non-public 
economic sector and to comprehensively develop all sorts of 
economic elements; 9) To further reform of the science, 
technology, and education systems, and to make science, 
technology, and education better serve economic construction; 
10) To further improve family planning work and fulfill this 
year's population control quota; 11) To maintain social 
stability and create a favorable environment for reform and 
development; 12) To firmly grasp two major work aspects at the 
same time, and to vigorously promote the building of spiritual 
civilization. 
  Governor Ma Zhongchen also spelled out the following several 
major tasks for the present and the immediate future: 1) To 
actively open up new sources of goods, properly control 
commodity prices, and guarantee an ample supply of commodities 
on the market during the Lunar New Year Festival period; 2) To 
make comprehensive and flawless arrangements for the livelihood 
of staff and workers, and to support and assist disaster- and 
poverty-stricken areas in a down-to-earth manner; 3) To make 
sound arrangements for agricultural production and to step up 
the management of wheat fields; 4) To strengthen income 
management and guarantee sufficient wage payment to staff and 
workers. 
  The provincial government's fifth plenary session was 
presided over by Vice Governor Fan Qingchen and was attended by 
Vice Governors Zhang Shiying, Zhang Honghua, and Yu Jiahua; by 
persons in charge of various provincial departments, bureaus, 
and commissions; by Zhong Lisheng, vice chairman of the 
provincial people's congress standing committee; by Liu Yujie, 
vice chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference; and others.

  [Text] Zhengzhou, February 13 (XINHUA) -- Henan, which 
ordinarily is known as an important agricultural province in 
China, has risen to become the ninth most important industrial 
province in China. 
  The latest authoritative statistics show that the industrial 
output value of Henan, whose area accounts for merely 1.8 
percent of the country's total, reached 230 billion yuan in 
1993, making up four percent of the national total, ranking 
ninth among all 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous 
regions of the Chinese mainland. 
  Although the agricultural output value of the province in 
1993 increased by 9.8 percent over the previous year's to reach 
61.5 billion yuan, the proportion of agricultural output value 
to the total industrial and agricultural output value dropped to 
only a little more than 20 percent. 
  Experts noted that by adopting the reform and opening 
policy, 
Henan Province has managed a substantial boost to its 
agricultural production. With a great surplus in farm produce 
and rural laborers, the province began a quick development of 
its industry, particularly rural industrial enterprises, at the 
end of the sixth state five-year planning period (1981-85). 
  The province managed to increase its industrial output value 
to 230 billion yuan in 1993 from 30 billion yuan in 1984. 
During the period from 1991 to 1993, its industrial output 
value rose at an average rate of more than 20 percent a year. 
The province now ranks at least ninth in the output of 12 out 
of the 17 most important industrial products listed by the 
central government. It has become a major supplier of coal and 
electricity to a dozen provinces and municipalities in east and 
central China. 
  In particular, the output value of the province's rural 
industrial enterprises rose to over 100 billion yuan in 1993 
from only several billion yuan in 1984. Many villages and 
enterprises in the province now claim annual output values 
surpassing 100 million yuan each. An enterprise engaging in the 
production of diamond grinding materials has become the biggest 
of its kind in Asia. Some other enterprises are now the biggest 
of their kind within the country. 
  Industrial development has also promoted the development of 
agriculture. Last year, the province's grain output amounted to 
35 billion kilograms, 10 percent more than in the previous year, 
setting an all-time high.

<F P=106> [Lunar New Year greetings by Fujian Provincial CPC Secretary </F>
Jia Qinglin to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots, and to 
Overseas Chinese and Chinese residing abroad; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Compatriots and friends: At a time when the 
Chinese people are happily celebrating the Spring Festival, on 
behalf of the Fujian Provincial CPC Committee, the Fujian 
Provincial People's Government, and the 31 million Fujian 
people, I express my Lunar New Year greetings to Taiwan, Hong 
Kong, and Macao compatriots, as well as to overseas Chinese and 
to Chinese residing abroad. I also wish your families a happy 
life in the New Year. 
  The past year has been one in which we have comprehensively 
implemented the instructions of the 14th CPC National Congress 
and one in which we have advanced victoriously along Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theoy of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Fujian's national economy has developed 
speedily and well; its GNP has increased by three-fold,seven 
years ahead of schedule; and it has taken a solid step forward 
in establishing the socialist market economy structure. 
Macrocontrol and regulation have strengthened and improved. 
Marked achievements have been made in opening the market. 
Foreign economic relations and trade have developed strongly. 
The people's lives have continued to improve. New progress has 
been made in the formation of the socialist legal system and 
spiritual civilization. In particular, Fujian Province has 
built closer ties with Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots, 
as well as with overseas Chinese and friendly personalities 
abroad. Their foreign economic and trade cooperation has entered 
a new period of stability and development. [passage omitted] 
  The year 1994 is a crucial one for the province to move 
forward steadily in building socialism. Seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, widening the scope of opening up, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability are the main 
aspects of this year's work. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theoy of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, and under the 
leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the core, we will hold high the banner of great 
solidarity and great alliance, focus on development and reform, 
preserve our political stability, bring about overall social 
progress, and lay a good foundation for the materialization of 
moderate prosperity in Fujian ahead of schedule. 
  The materialization of our objectives requires the hard work 
of the people throughout the province, as well as the common 
efforts of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots, and of 
overseas Chinese and Chinese residing abroad. [passage omitted] 
  We should develop an export-oriented economy, carry out 
large 
and serial projects, widen the avenues for introducing foreign 
capital, and expand foreign trade and exports through various 
channels. [passage omitted] 
  The people on both sides of the strait hope for 
reunification. Creating conditions for early direct three 
exchanges between the two sides is an inevitable trend. Fujian 
will continue to improve its environment so as to bring about 
direct three exchanges and promote the motherland's 
reunification. In conclusion, I sincerely thank all compatriots 
and friends who have made contributions to Fujian's development, 
and hope that you will continue to support Fujian's construction.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xu Wanying (6079 1354 5391): "Chen Huanyou </F>
Calls for Attaching Greater Importance to `Vegetable Basket' and 
`Rice Sack'"] 
  [Excerpts] Food is the first necessity of the people. 
Government at all levels must take the "vegetable basket" and 
"rice sack" seriously. No matter how heavy their workload is, 
they must place the "vegetable basket" and "rice sack" high on 
their agenda. They must devote major efforts -- and display 
great resolution -- to carrying out this major task that has a 
direct bearing on people's lives and economic development as a 
whole. This is the demand set by Chen Huanyou, secretary of the 
provincial Party Committee and governor, at the provincial 
conference on the "vegetable basket," grain, and edible oil that 
was held yesterday. 
  Comrade Chen Huanyou said: The overall situation in our 
province is excellent insofar as the "vegetable basket" and 
"rice sack" are concerned. In recent years, Jiangsu's grain 
output has stabilized at around 32 billion kg; production of 
nonstaple foodstuffs has also increased. Last year, output of 
hogs and aquatic products reached new highs; production of 
poultry, eggs, and fruit is on the rise, and acreage for 
vegetables -- output as well -- expanded significantly in rural 
areas. Therefore, we have a solid base and there should be no 
shortages. Why then did prices rise sharply a short while ago? 
The reasons are as follows: 1) Prices of farm products were 
too low to begin with, so prices naturally rose once controls 
were lifted. 2) The effect of natural disasters. The freezing 
cold last November did considerable damage to vegetables. 3) An 
excessive amount of vegetable plots in the outskirts have been 
diverted to other purposes in recent years. In some localities, 
those plots have not been promptly replaced. 4) Inefficient 
administration. It is still not easy for peasants to sell their 
produce in cities, and a handful of unlawful businessmen were 
cornering the market and cheating the customers. 5) Regulatory 
mechanisms were not functioning well. After grain prices rose 
abnormally, no immediate action was taken to bring prices down 
by selling large quantities of grain. Therefore, we must have a 
high sense of political responsibility and pay great attention 
to solving the problems related to the "vegetable basket." 
Only then will we be able to maintain social tranquility and 
stability and create a good external environment for reform and 
economic development. [passage omitted] 
  Ji Yunshi, member of the Standing Committee of the 
provincial 
Party Committee and deputy governor, and Jiang Yongron, deputy 
governor, were present at the meeting. Jiang Yongrong gave a 
report outlining specific arrangements with regard to "vegetable 
basket" work.

<F P=106> [Report by Xiang Mingsheng (0686 2494 3932): "Violations of </F>
Economic Laws and Regulations Down, But the Amount of Money 
Involved Up in Shanghai"] 
  [Text] According to statistics, Shanghai's industrial and 
commercial administrative organs at various levels investigated 
and dealt with over 9,000 violations of economic laws and 
regulations and received 308.7 million yuan in fines and 
confiscations last year, down 36 percent and up 17 percent, 
respectively, compared with the previous year. They have 
recovered nearly 350 million yuan for the victims, an increase 
of 500 percent over the previous year. 
  Shanghai seized nearly 600 fake imported color televisions 
in 
two months last year and in the second half of the year, 180 
sets of counterfeit Mitsubishi 5G6 air conditioners were seized. 
From April to June last year, a Taiwanese businessman purchased 
and brought 1,537 used suits to Shanghai, where he hired some 
people to wash and sort these clothes out. Then he attached 
labels of trademark he brought from Taiwan to these clothes and 
put them on sale at a stall he had rented in a garment center in 
Shanghai. Some 590 suits were sold at 180,000 yuan or more. 
Smuggling, trafficking, fraud in sale and purchase based on 
economic contracts, and other activities are getting more 
rampant than ever and have shown signs of spreading from 
individuals to enterprises.

  [Text] The second meeting of the Shanghai Municipal 
Leading Group for the Crackdown on Smuggling was held today. 
Meng Jianzhu, deputy mayor and head of the leading group, 
attended the meeting and spoke. 
  According to figures, the municipality made remarkable 
progress in cracking down on smuggling last year. Over 1,500 
violations involving smuggling and selling of contraband goods 
were uncovered last year in the Shanghai area. The goods 
involved in those violations were estimated at 334 million yuan. 
The focus of Shanghai's anti-smuggling work this year will be 
on the investigation of major cases, with special emphasis on 
cracking down on smuggling by enterprises and establishments 
through cargo transport channels, and organized smuggling and 
blackmarketing. We should, in particular, strike at the 
ringleaders, principal offenders, and habitual criminals. Cases 
of gross violations that involve huge amounts of illicit goods, 
the use of violence to resist antismuggling efforts, 
collaboration from within and without, law- breaking by 
law-enforcement personnel, and pose a great harm to society must 
be dealt with promptly and severely.

Spring Festival. 
  Governor Shao Qihui presided over the mass gathering. 
[passage omitted] 
  Attending the mass gathering were leaders of the provincial 
party, government, and military organizations, members of the 
CPC Central Committee, members of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission, and standing committee members of the 
National Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, including Sun Weiben, Zhou Wenhua, Ma Guoliang, Tian 
Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Chen Yunlin, Li Jiating, Meng Qingxiang, 
Yang Guanghong, Wang Xianmin, Li Qinglin, Yu Jingchang, Li 
Genshen, An Zhendong, Qi Guiyuan, Xie Yong, Du Xianzhong, Zhu 
Dianming, Zhao Jicheng, Liu Hanwu, Cong Fukui, Sun Kuiwen, Zhou 
Tienong, Wang Zongzhang, Wang Haiyan, Huang Feng, Dai Moan, Fu 
Shiying, Guo Shouchang, Chen Wenzhi, Tan Fangzhi, Zhao Shijie, 
Chen Zhanyuan, Wang Zhitian, Wang Guiqin, (Wu Yueqian), and Dong 
Yisheng. Also attending were the veteran comrades retired from 
the provincial-level organizations, including Zhao Dezun, Chen 
Lei, Li Jianbai, Wang Zhao, and Chen Jianfei. 
  Comrade Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, made an ebullient speech at the mass gathering. 
[passage omitted] 
  After reviewing the achievements scored by the province in 
reform, opening up, and economic construction last year, Sun 
Weiben said: 1994 is a year critical to the invigoration and 
development of Heilongjiang. This year, the economic structural 
reform begins to enter the most difficult stage of pressing 
ahead comprehensively and making breakthroughs in key areas, and 
economic construction is at the critical period of readjusting 
structure and improving efficiency. During this new year, we 
should accelerate the pace of building the socialist market 
economic structure and the pace of developing the productive 
forces of the countryside and the county economy in an effort to 
further expand the scale of opening up. During this new year, 
we should actually build the socialist spiritual civilization, 
build the party, and build democracy and the legal system so as 
to create a fine legal system environment for reform and 
development. 
  Sun Weiben emphatically pointed out: During this new year, 
we should do more good and practical deeds for the masses. 
Based on developing the economy, we should strive to increase 
the practical income of urban and rural residents, strictly 
control the increase margin of commodity prices, improve the 
people's living standards and living quality, show concern for 
the masses' weal and woe, and adopt all effective measures to 
make appropriate arrangements for the livelihood of the people 
in poverty-stricken areas and the livelihood of the workers and 
staff of the enterprises that have been closed down, suspended 
production, and gone bankrupt. We should actively press ahead 
the housing system reform and seek to basically solve the 
housing problems for the households with special difficulties by 
the end of this year. We should maintain close ties between the 
party and the people and consolidate and develop political 
stability and unity. 
  Sun Weiben said in conclusion: In this new year, 
opportunities and challenges coexist, difficulties and hopes 
coexist, the burdens on our shoulders are even more heavy, and 
our tasks are even more arduous. To fulfill the tasks on 
reform, development, and stability, we must depend on the 
concerted efforts of party and government organizations at all 
levels, all economic organizations, all military organizations, 
and all institutions in the province. At the same time, the vast 
numbers of party members and cadres and the people of all 
nationalities on all circles should unite as one and strive for 
development towards a same goal. Under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, we should closely rally around the CPC Central 
Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, and work 
hard with one heart and one mind to push forward the province's 
reform and construction.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video prepared by station </F>
reporters (Meng Fuchun) and (Huo Yanmin); from the "Xinjiang 
News" program] 
  [Text] The sixth meeting of the eighth regional people's 
congress standing committee held its second plenary session 
today. Entrusted by the regional people's congress, Vice 
Chairman Wang Lequan delivered a report to the standing 
committee on the current economic situation and major reforms in 
1994. He said: In 1993, under the guidance of the 14th CPC 
National Congress guidelines, Xinjiang strengthened the 
intensity of reform and overcame difficulties in achieving 
fairly good results in economic construction and other fields of 
endeavor. The regional economy has maintained a strong growth 
momentum; the gross regional product is expected to reach 37.7 
billion yuan, about 10 percent more than 1992; and agriculture 
and animal husbandry have reaped their 16th consecutive year of 
harvests, while industrial production has come out of the 
predicament of slow growth and poor efficiency and begun to 
bounce back. Moreover, revenues have increased, the financial 
situation has further improved, progress has been made in 
developing foreign economic relations and trade, investment in 
fixed assets has increased steadily, and infrastructure 
construction has been further strengthened. 
  He pointed out: Xinjiang's current political situation is 
good. The entire region has seen political stability, national 
unity, and steady progress in all fields of endeavor. While 
Xinjiang has been able to maintain a strong momentum for 
economic growth, problems and difficulties continue to exist in 
the regional economy. First, in agriculture, the investment in 
production growth rate has dropped and precluded long-term 
development. Second, in industry, the foundation remains weak: 
investment is inadequate for upgrading enterprises' technology, 
progress has been slow in readjusting production structure and 
product mix, and economic efficiency needs much improvement. 
Third, in finance, there is a serious shortage of capital; 
funds for capital construction cannot be allocated in time; and, 
as a result of debt chains, enterprises are facing a slow 
turnover of funds and are in serious shortage of working 
capital. Fourth, (?the pressure) on railway transport has 
continued. Fifth, irrational export product mix and the lack of 
cash in conducting trade have caused a decrease of exports. 
Sixth, price rises of commodities cannot be curbed. 
  Wang Lequan also explained the progress in economic 
structural reform and the regional wage, housing, and price 
reforms; as well as the current situation in commodity prices 
and arrangements for price reform in 1994. 
  The session heard a report by Su Yongguang, chairman of the 
regional planning commission, on drafting the 1994 regional 
plans; a report by (Gong Jinyou), director of the regional 
finance department, on the drafting of the 1994 regional budget; 
and a report by (Xie Haiping), deputy secretary general of the 
regional people's government, on handling motions submitted by 
the first session of the eighth regional people's congress. 
  Turbayim, vice chairman of the regional people's congress 
standing committee, chaired the session. 
  Chairman Amudun Niyaz and Vice Chairmen Xie Fuping, (Hujihan 
Hakomov), and (Amina Apar), of the regional people's Congress 
standing committee, attended the session.

Region Continued To Maintain Its Momentum of Economic Growth 
Last Year as We Made Efforts To Solve Conspicuous Contradictions 
by Making Economic Construction Our Central Task"] 
  [Excerpts] In 1993, the whole region paid close attention 
to the central task of economic construction, made efforts to 
solve the conspicuous contradictions and problems cropping up in 
the course of economic operations, and achieved marked successes 
in economic construction. 
  -- Xinjiang continued to maintain its momentum of economic 
growth. Xinjiang's annual total output value of goods and 
services fulfilled the plan for the year and was estimated to 
exceed the previous year's by approximately 10 percent. Total 
industrial and agricultural output value posted a growth rate of 
8.6 percent; among them total industrial output value showed a 
growth rate of 10.6 percent. Total export volume and financial 
revenue registered a growth rate of 9 percent and 33.08 percent, 
respectively. 
  -- Xinjiang consolidated banking order, rectified money 
borrowings in violation of regulations, put an end to various 
unauthorized collections of funds, strengthened control over 
cash, and gradually improved banking order which had once been 
in chaos. It was estimated that over 1 billion yuan's worth of 
loans flowing out from the banks were recovered in the whole 
year. The total amount of various deposits in banks showed an 
increase of 702.5 million yuan from August to December; the 
figure was 1.05 times the amount of growth in the whole year. 
The contradiction existing in the supply of and demand for 
credit funds was somewhat eased, and the macroeconomic operation 
environment was improved. 
  -- Xinjiang made important progress in capital construction, 
which focused on infrastructure projects and basic industries. 
Local social investments in fixed assets were estimated to 
increase by 30.9 percent. The autonomous region's 35 key 
projects under construction were making good progress. Xinjiang 
fulfilled the target of putting 11 projects into full operation 
in 1993. [passage omitted] 
  -- Xinjiang opened its doors wider to the outside world. Its 
economic cooperation with regions to the east and its exports to 
the regions to the west developed in depth. It successfully 
sponsored the second Urumqi trade fair for border and local 
areas in 1993. Total import and export volume increased by 30.3 
percent for the year. Local and border trade enjoyed relatively 
rapid development. The export volume of local and border trade 
was estimated to grow by 75.5 percent. The amount of foreign 
funds utilized in the year posted a growth rate of 86.9 percent 
over the previous year's.

  [Excerpt] On 28 January the Urumqi Intermediate People's 
Court handed down sentences in public on a number of offenders 
convicted of such serious crimes as manslaughter, robbery, and 
rape. With the approval of the Xinjiang Autonomous Regional 
Higher People's Court, nine of them, including Huang Jianchao,

  The criminals harshly punished by the law on 28 January

manslaughter, one after another, in revenge and then conducted 
counterrevolutionary propaganda and instigation when they

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Dahong (2621 1129 1347): "Will There </F>
Be New Progress in People-to-People Negotiations Between the Two 
Sides of the Strait This Year?"] 
  [Text] With the 1994 New Year holiday barely over, Chiao 
Jen-ho, the newly appointed deputy board director and 
concurrently secretary-general of Taiwan's Straits Exchange 
Foundation [SEF], is to arrive in Beijing at the invitation of 
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] 
to negotiate routine affairs of the two organizations. Much 
common understanding was reached in cross-strait talks over 
day-to-day affairs last year, will there be new progress in the 
upcoming Beijing meeting on that basis? Will the accords of the 
"Wang-Gu talks" be implemented in a comprehensive way in the new 
year? 
<H3>  China Mainland Pushes the Comprehensive Implementation of 
the Accord of the "Wang-Gu Talks" </H3>
  As the first contact and talks between high-ranking figures 
over the past 40-some years, the "Wang-Gu talks" that took place 
in Singapore in April 1993 raised the curtain of a new stage for 
the institutional dialogue and negotiation between authorized 
nongovernment organizations. 
  In its wake, ARATS set out a proposal for implementing the 
relevant accords of the "Wang-Gu talks" in a comprehensive way, 
namely, negotiations on specific affairs related to 
repatriation, crackdown on maritime crimes in joint efforts, 
dealing with maritime disputes over fishery, protection of 
intelligent property rights, and ties and agreement between 
justice courts of the two sides. In addition, negotiations 
should be conducted on economic topics and science and 
technological exchanges in the spirit of the accord as early as 
possible. In mutual cooperation, ARATS and SEF conducted work 
negotiations on three occasions in Beijing, Xiamen, and Taipei 
in late August, early November and late December last year 
respectively. 
  Through these negotiations, especially the work negotiations 
held in Taipei for the first time on 21-22 December, 
comparatively great progress was made on many issues by the 
joint efforts of the two sides. 
  --The ARATS negotiation group participating in talks in 
Taiwan was a step toward implementing the "Wang-Gu talks" 
accords as well as anm advance in ARATS-SEF ties and exchanges. 
  --These negotiations have further deepened common 
understanding in "repatriating people who have entered the other 
side in violation of relevant rules and regulations and related 
issues" and "negotiating handling of maritime fishery disputes." 
  --The two sides have exchanged views on such routine topics 
as the crackdown on maritime criminal activities, such as 
"maritime smuggling and robbery," and "the rights and privileges 
of Taiwan businessmen investing on the mainland"; --The two 
sides reached important common understanding on "the principle 
of repatriation of hijackers," within the basic framework of the 
accord on repatriating hijackers between the two shores, by 
careful study of the wording of the overwhelming majority of 
this accord gone through. 
  People here believe that should an accord on the 
repatriation 
of hijackers be reached between the two sides, its significance 
will go beyond insuring safety in air traffic between the two 
sides, and it will play an important role in augmenting and 
promoting ties and exchanges between the two shores in every 
respect; this being so, it will certainly be welcomed by and 
assessed highly by Chinese both at home and overseas. 
<H5>  Where Lie the Hurdles That Affect ARATS-SEF Cooperation? </H5>
  Although a series of results at a certain stage have been 
scored in cross-strait people-to-people talks, no accord was 
eventually signed. The fundamental cause lies in the fact that 
Taiwan has included some political issues that were quite beyond 
the two sides' common understanding for the time being in the 
negotiations on routine affairs in an attempt to create the 
so-called "independent sovereignty" and "equal judicial powers" 
to fulfill its pursuit of "two equal political bodies." That 
did not fall in line with the orientation of being 
non-governmental, economic, routine, and functional, set by the 
"Wang-Gu talks" accords. Both ARATS and SEF are 
non-governmental organizations, and differences in political 
issues between the two shores should not have been brought up in 
negotiations on people-to-people affairs. 
  In ARATS-SEF negotiations on routine affairs in 1992, the 
two 
sides established a common understanding by each making an oral 
statement that "the two sides of the strait adhere to the one 
China principle," thus making major progress in ARATS-SEF 
negotiations possible thereafter. With the accords on 
cross-strait utilization and verification of notaries and on 
"inquiries about and compensation for registered letters," 
especially, the realization of the "Wang-Gu talks" was itself a 
breakthrough; all this showed that two authorized 
non-governmental organizations from the two shores might settle 
some routine issues surfacing in cross-strait people- to-people 
ties and exchanges and push forward various cross-strait ties 
and exchanges under the condition that political differences 
between the two shores remain unsettled, so long as some issues 
lacking unanimity are avoided while adopting a practical 
attitude and practice. 
  Now the Taiwan authorities insist on so-called "equal 
judicial powers" in routine negotiations of non-governmental 
organizations. Essentially, they are creating "two Chinas" in 
disguise; beyond a doubt, that is an impasse. 
<H3>  Doing Substantial Work Is the Best Way To Resolve 
Cross-Strait Issues </H3>
  Thus, to resolve routine issues in cross-strait exchanges, 
the practical and constructive way can only be what Tang Shubei 
has set out that the two sides "should refrain from involving 
sensitive issues that lack common understanding," "avoid issues 
pending unanimity between the two sides with technical wordings." 
  When Chiao Jen-ho first took office as SEF deputy board 
director and concurrently secretary-general toward the end of 
last year, he said that to adopt practical way, accumulate 
common understanding in routine topics, augment the foundation 
of mutual trust was a task of top priority for basic solutions 
to cross-strait issues. 
  At the just-concluded third session of the ARATS first 
council in Beijing, the work agenda decided on by ARATS for 1994 
included: Promoting reciprocal visits of ARATS and SEF 
responsible persons and pushing for the second Wang-Gu talks; 
continuing to promote cross- strait economic exchanges and 
cooperation; doing more substantial work to protect the 
legitimate rights and privileges of Taiwan businessmen's 
investment on the mainland; striving for negotiations with SEF 
over such issues as "the rights and privileges of Taiwan 
businessmen's investment on the mainland and related issues," 
"cross-strait reciprocal visits of figures from industrial and 
business circles," "development and exchanges in energy and 
other resources," and the issue of "cross-strait exchanges in 
science and technology," while striving to reach some accords; 
at the same time, making preparations in joint efforts for 
convoking a conference authorized by both sides on 
people-to-people economic exchanges. In addition, on the basis 
of the two sides acquiring common understanding in negotiations 
on routine affairs, efforts will be exerted to resolve existing 
differences and strive to sign an accord with SEF as early as 
possible. 
  An authoritative figure here indicated that one of the 
important results of "Wang-Gu talks" was to have common 
understandings written down in an accord, namely, "both sides 
believe that there is a need to augment economic ties and make 
up for each other's shortages with mutual benefits." The 
"Wang-Gu talks" were not easily realized; the two sides should 
set great store by the results. Only by implementing related 
accords in a comprehensive way to score results in the 
negotiations on five routine topics, including economic and 
scientific and technological exchanges, as early as possible 
will it be possible to consolidate and develop the results of 
"Wang-Gu talks," thus pushing further development of 
cross-strait relations. 
  People are waiting to see whether or not genuine efforts 
will 
be exerted in Chiao Jen-ho's upcoming trip to Beijing to 
implement the "Wang-Gu talks" accord in a comprehensive way in 
the new year.

  [Text] ROC [Republic of China] President Li Teng-hui has 
reached agreement with Indonesian Minister of Research and 
Technology Jusuf Habibie on issues of investing in the natural 
gas, (?physics) and (?coal) industries between the two 
countries, while President Li Teng-hui was spending the Chinese 
New Year holidays in Indonesia. 
  Adviser to the ROC's Ministry of Economic Affairs Liu 
Tai-ying, who is accompanying the President on his trip along 
with 30 other government officials, also verified that there 
will a big businessmen tour group who will be investigating into 
the possibility of investing in the Indonesian industries in 
March. 
  Meanwhile, international news agency REUTER reported the 
President's trip to Indonesia as one that is shrouded in 
secrecy. President Li, making his second overseas trip since 
assuming office in 1988, arrived on the resort island of Bali on 
Wednesday [9 February] for a five-day visit after a brief 
stopover in the Philippines. 
  Beijing on Thursday protested Li's trip to the Philippines 
and his meeting with Filipino President Fidel Ramos and other 
Philippine officials. 
  Indonesia was President Li's second stop on the 
three-country 
tour which prompted Mainland China to warn the Philippines, 
Indonesia, and Thailand that their relations with Beijing would 
be harmed if the visits went ahead. 
  An official in Bali said Li, who is likely to have dinner 
with President Suharto on Friday, flew to Bantam on Thursday 
with his host Research and Technology Minister Jusuf Habibie. 
At the state-run IPTN aircraft factories in Bantam, southeast 
of Jakarta, visitors were denied entry, and security appeared to 
have been stepped up, REUTER reported. 
  Taipei said last month it was studying possible aviation 
tie-up with Indonesia and Mainland China [as received] after 
failing to form joint ventures with Western aerospace companies. 
The Indonesian aircraft factory IPTN's centerpiece is its 
70-seat N-250 medium-haul turboprop communter plane due to enter 
service in 1996. 
  The Indonesian aircraft company also produces under license 
French-designed Puma and U.S. Bell helicopters as well as parts 
for U.S.-designed F-16 fighters and British-developed Rapier 
missiles. 
  Indonesia has formal diplomatic ties with Beijing and 
Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas has said a private visit by Li will not 
change Jakarta's one-China policy. Indonesian officials have 
stressed that senior officials meeting President Li would do so 
in their private capacity.

  [Text] Indonesia threw a blanket of secrecy over a planned 
meeting between visiting ROC [Republic of China] President Li 
Teng-hui and Indonesian President Suharto on the resort island 
of Bali on Friday [11 February]. 
  Officials in Jakarta, who are being tight-lipped ever since 
Li arrived in Bali on Wednesday on a three-country trip that has 
raised the ire of Mainland China, declined to give details, but 
said they expected that the two leaders had already met in 
Taipei. 
  Meanwhile, Taiwan Television Enterprise, or TTV, confirmed 
Friday night that Li after having met Friday [as received] 
before Suharto flew back to Jakarta in the late afternoon. 
Although no video or still pictures of Li and Suharto together 
were featured on the television newscast, the vehicles used by 
both Li and Suharto were shown arriving at the Bali meeting site. 
  According to TTV, Suharto reportedly expressed his 
admiration 
for impressive achievements of Taiwan small and medium 
enterprises. Meanwhile, Li reportedly said the ROC wanted to 
boost its role as a partner in international and regional 
economic groupings, as well as work to help insure the 
maintenance of peace in the region. 
  In Indonesia, the official ANTARA news agency said: Suharto, 
accompanied by State Secretary Murdiono and Tourism and 
Telecommunications Minister Joop Ave, was to visit Bali on 
Friday to see the Grand Bali Beach Hotel, which was devastated 
by fire one year ago. 
  Official sources said: Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had also 
traveled to Bali on Friday. Suharto's movements were off limit 
to all journalists. 
  President Li's tour of Southeast Asia, billed as a private 
trip, has angered Mainland China, which regards Taiwan as a 
renegade province. Beijing warned the Philippines, Indonesia, 
and Thailand their relations with Mainland China could be 
damaged if they allowed Li's trip to proceed. 
  Indonesia, current chairman of the Nonaligned Movement and 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, has formal diplomatic 
ties with Beijing. Foreign Minister Alatas has said a private 
visit by Li will not change Jakarta's one-China policy. Quote, 
Li Teng-hui's visit to Bali is only an informal one. He is on 
vacation in Bali. There is no deviation from Indonesia's stand 
of having only trade relations with Taiwan, unquote. 
  In the aftermath of ROC President Li Teng-hui's lunch with 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos this week, Mainland China said 
the meeting sabotaged friendly relations between Beijing and 
Manila. But Ramos immediately countered that he had not violated 
Manila's one-China policy. Beijing's embassy in Manila said it 
will lodge a formal protest over Wednesday's luncheon meeting 
between Li and Ramos. A copy of the embassy's statement was 
sent to the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday. 
In the statement, the embassy accused Taiwan of pursuing a 
southward policy aimed at developing substantive relations with 
some nations and creating a two-China situation. Beijing 
officially regards Taiwan as a renegade province. 
  Before Li flew into Subic Bay, northwest of Manila, on the 
first leg of a three-nation private trip, Beijing told the 
Philippines the visit would harm relations. 
  The Ramos government tried to throw a veil of secrecy over 
the meeting. Once news leaked out, Ramos acknowledged that it 
took place, but said it did not violate Manila's one-China 
policy under which the Philippines officially recognizes 
Mainland China. 
  In a live interview on Philippine television Thursday night, 
Ramos said he and Li had not talked about political matters. 
Ramos said they only discussed trade and economic cooperation 
which is allowed under the one-China policy. Under the term of 
its one-China policy, the Philippine Government officially 
recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China, 
of which Taiwan is an integral part. Ramos said that Taiwan is 
today the biggest investor in Subic Bay. Taiwan-based 
enterprises are investing in a 300 hectre industrial estate 
which will be the site of 150 factories which is scheduled to be 
inaugurated on 20 February. Ramos added that Taiwan has 
arranged for soft loans amounting to $23 million for the 
development of Subic Bay. This could be expanded to $100 
million in the next couple of years depending on the need, he 
added. Ramos also said that he and Li discussed joint ventures 
in agriculture-based businesses. Li reportedly told Ramos that 
he would like to see the Philippines supply Taiwan's sugar 
reguirements since sugar production on the island has dropped 
significantly due to land use changes. Ramos hosted a luncheon 
meeting at the Admiral's House in Subic for Li and his entourage 
of 60 businessmen and officials, including Foreign Minister 
Federick Chien and Council for Economic and Planning Development 
Chairman Vincent Hsiao. 
  Philippine officials said Beijing's reaction was largely 
what 
had already been expected. They said the Phillipines has to 
balance its desire for good relations with Beijing against its 
urgent need for investment from Taiwan.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "End of embargo; Expanded relations"] </F>
  [Text] The decision by U.S. President Bill Clinton to end 
the decades- old U.S. trade embargo against its former enemy 
Vietnam has been widely welcomed here by leaders from both 
public and private sectors. 
  Many locally owned factories in Vietnam which were set up in 
the Southeast Asian country under the assumption the embargo 
would soon be lifted will surely turn a handsome profit as a 
result of the U.S. policy change. 
  To date, investments by Taiwan-based enterprises in Vietnam 
are estimated to be worth more than US$1.5 billion, making the 
island that nation's number one source of foreign capital. 
  Most local companies went to Vietnam because of the 
availability of cheap labor there. Vietnam also shares much in 
common with Taiwan, due to its cultural heritage, work ethic and 
the customs of its people. This commonality has surely helped 
to attract investment from Taiwan. 
  Over the past few years, labor-intensive manufacturers of 
various products ranging from textiles to low-end electronics 
have been unable to maintain their price competitiveness 
vis-a-vis other competitors in Southeast Asia and mainland 
China, due to rising costs on the island. 
  Seeing that these industries had to move somewhere, 
authorities here rightly encouraged them to set up production 
lines in Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam, in order to 
avoid risking too many of the country's financial and industrial 
resources in mainland China, which has been the top choice for 
outbound investment for many years. 
  Now that the U.S. embargo has been lifted, the Vietnamese 
economy is expected to be given a great boost and the country 
will certainly become more important in the international arena. 
  However, the ROC [Republic of China] government should be 
careful not to assess the current situation in Vietnam by 
looking through recolored glasses. 
  In the late 1970s when relations between the United States 
and mainland China were normalized, many people got caught up in 
the euphoria that went along with the new friendly relations 
between the two countries and forgot that the mainland remained 
a communist state. 
  After tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled over the 
dead bodies of students and workers who dared to speak out 
against the Beijing regime in 1989, many people in the outside 
world were surprised to learn that communist China had retained 
a Leninist system of suppression after the death of Mao Tse-tung. 
  Now that Vietnam and the United States have apparently 
bridged some of their differences, people in Taiwan should 
refrain from adopting a similarly naive attitude about the 
leadership in Hanoi. 
  Formally known as the "Socialist Republic of Vietnam," our 
southwesterly neighbor is one of the world's last remaining 
communist dictatorships, and the leadership of the Vietnamese 
Communist Party is doing all it can to keep it that way. 
  To be sure, sweeping economic reforms were made by 
Vietnamese 
leaders beginning in 1986 with the so-called "doi moi" or 
"renovation" policies. But virtually no major political reforms 
have been made, except for efforts aimed at transferring more 
day-to-day administrative duties from party committees to 
official state organs apparently in order to avoid wasteful 
duplication and the transferring of certain administrative 
responsibilities to local governments in order to increase the 
efficiency of the state bureaucracy. 
  The Vietnamese Communist Party has retained its leading role 
in all important spheres of life in Vietnam. Any attempt to 
organize any kind of opposition force is still, as always, 
ruthlessly persecuted in Vietnam today. 
  The Vietnamese communists also continue to restrict 
religious 
activity throughout the country. 
  After the government of the Republic of Vietnam fell on 
April 
30, 1975, and the south was brought under the control of 
northern-led forces, Chinese-Vietnamese citizens who had 
previously belonged to the pro-Taiwan camp or who held 
identification papers issued by the Republic of China were 
persecuted by the communists and in many cases their properties 
and businesses were confiscated. 
  After Vietnam invaded Cambodia and Hanoi's former allies in 
communist China staged a fierce attack on northern Vietnam in 
the late 1970s, many ethnic Chinese living in the country even 
those who had been pro-Beijing were forced to flee the country 
for their lives. 
  While we can't allow bad memories to unnecessarily restrict 
our contacts and trade with Vietnam, we should not forget the 
harsh treatment that people of Chinese ancestry have received at 
the hands of the Vietnamese communists. 
  Although the end of the U.S. embargo will certainly mean 
even 
more contacts, exchanges and investments in Vietnam, we should 
not allow ourselves to get carried away and make a mockery of 
our democratic ideals by hopping in bed with the Vietnamese 
communists. 
  As the old saying goes: "Those who lie down with dogs get up 
with fleas."

  [Text] The cross-strait talks concluded yesterday, with a 
joint statement citing a consensus reached by negotiators from 
Taipei and Beijing. 
  But government officials in Taipei accused Beijing of 
improperly intermingling politics into legal issues. 
  The joint statement was issued by Chiao Jen-ho, 
secretary-general of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], 
and his mainland counterpart, Tang Shubei of the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), itemizing major 
agreements reached during the five-day talks in Beijing. Chiao 
and other SEF delegates returned to Taiwan last night. 
  The joint statement said the two sides have reached 
consensus 
on such thorny issues as repatriation of hijackers and illegal 
immigrants as well as bicoastal fishing disputes, adding that 
differences remain to be tackled in the next round of functional 
talks. 
  "Both sides made some concessions," Chiao said. "Reaching 
consensus during this round of talks is what we call a `win-win' 
situation." 
  In the meantime, however, Kao Kung-lien, vice chairman of 
the 
supervisory Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), told reporters that 
the consensus reached in the Beijing meetings "are at best 
consensus in principle." He added that the two sides still 
failed to find common ground for as many as 10 items. 
  Even for the issues that both sides have agreed on, "it will 
still test our wisdom to put the consensus into words," Kao 
said, referring to the wording of a formal agreement. 
  The MAC ran an overnight meeting until 4 a.m. yesterday, 
giving its final approval on the Chiao-Tang statement. A few 
changes were made: the SEF and ARATS would only exchange, not 
discuss, views on economic issues during the next round of 
talks; the statement also left out the discussion for the 
arrangement of the second SEF-ARATS summit. 
  ARATS chairman Wang Daohan has invited his SEF counterpart, 
Ku Chen-fu, to visit Beijing in late spring or early summer, yet 
the MAC seems less enthusiastic to embrace the idea for fear 
that Beijing will use the high-level exchanges to achieve its 
political goal. 
  Both sides have agreed to hold the fourth round of 
functional 
talks in Beijing at the end of next month. Once formal 
agreements are reached on the three issues, Tang will come to 
Taipei to attend the signing ceremony, the Chiao-Tang statement 
said. 
  In a written statement, the MAC sharply criticized Tang's 
remarks, saying the SEF-ARATS talks should "avoid discussions of 
political and legal issues" as ambiguous. 
  In mid January, Tang said the ARATS would carry out the 
principles of "Peaceful reunification-one country, two systems," 
but during this round of talks, he asked the SEF delegates not 
to raise political and legal issues, according to the MAC 
statement. 
  "Under the communist doctrine, law, which only serves as a 
tool of politics, has nothing to do with social justice and 
public welfare," the MAC statement said. It went on to say that 
mainland negotiators could hardly understand that "Political 
issues belong to politics, legal issues belong to law." 
  During the next round of talks, the two sides will also 
exchange views on issues such as joint efforts to crack down on 
the criminal activities of marine smuggling and robbery, 
protection of intellectual property, mutual assistance between 
the judicial organs, and certain economic and technological 
subjects agreed to in last April's summit in Singapore, the 
statement said.

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] The Republic of China [ROC] and Japan have achieved 
a new breakthrough in the contacts between their economic and 
trade officials. Japan's International Trade Policy Bureau 
[ITPB] recently extended a formal invitation to Huang Yen-chao, 
director general of the Board of Foreign Trade [BOFT] in which 
it expressed the hope of facilitating unrestricted, two-way 
visits and exchanges, and of establishing a pattern for 
dialogue. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs [MOEA] 
has also completed a plan concerning the appropriate tactics 
aimed at coping with the possible impact on Sino-Japanese trade 
of the ROC's applying for GATT membership. The following is a 
report filed by Huang Mei-ting: 
  [Begin Huang Mei-ting recording] The ROC and Japan have made 
very good progress in promoting official contacts on economic 
and trade issues following the ROC's vigorous efforts to rejoin 
the international community. The level of visiting Japanese 
officials increased from the former departmental-head level to 
the current ITPB-director level. The two countries recently saw 
a new breakthrough in the pattern of their exchanges. The BOFT 
under the MOEA said: In the past, the two sides used to hold 
annual economic meetings through the Association of East Asian 
Relations and the Chinese-Japanese Interchange Association; 
however, because of their semiofficial nature, the meetings were 
usually more important in form than in substance. 
  Japan's ITPB recently reached a tacit mutual understanding 
with the MOEA's BOFT on mutual visits by ITPB and BOFT directors 
at irregular intervals every year for discussions on removing 
obstacles to Sino-Japanese trade. Japan's ITPB extended a 
formal invitation to BOFT Director General Huang Yen-chao to 
[words indistinct] visit Japan this year. This signaled a 
breakthrough beyond the former need of ROC officials to stress 
the private and informal nature of their visits to Japan. 
  In addition to the issue of the ROC's trade deficit with 
Japan, the ROC's application for GATT membership will also 
change the form of trade between the two countries. 
Departmental Head Chu Wei-cheng of the BOFT said: The ROC has 
completed an assessment of the ranking of priority items for 
negotiations with Japan on trade obstacles. Before obtaining 
GATT membership, the ROC will still focus its negotiations with 
Japan on readjusting the ROC's economic and trade system; after 
obtaining GATT membership, we shall then request Japan to scrap 
its discriminative measures against us in economic relations and 
trade. 
  [Chu Wei-cheng] Now we must deal with the matter by dividing 
it into two aspects. One aspect is our application for GATT 
membership. Possibly this is purely a request made of us by the 
other side. However, on the other hand, we hope to establish a 
channel for consultations to state our requirements to Japan and 
to negotiate with it in the future. 
  [Huang] Departmental Head Chu Wei-cheng said: The 
Sino-Japanese trade deficit may very likely increase due to the 
cancellation of trade restrictions on the importing of cars and 
other goods. The BOFT believes that the fundamental solution to 
the problem lies in beefing up the basic materials at home [as 
received]. In addition, enhancing the competitiveness of ROC 
products in Japan's market by lifting the ban on and increasing 
the imports of semifinished products from the mainland and by 
implementing a cross-strait division-of-labor system are another 
way for the government to reduce its trade deficit with Japan. 
  This is a report by Huang Mei-ting, Broadcasting Corporation 
of China correspondent, at the MOEA. [end recording]

  [Text] To beef up the anti-landing warfare capability of 
the Republic of China's [ROC] Army, the Chungshan Science 
Institute under the Ministry of National Defense held an 
exhibition at the Lungtan Light Aircraft Army Base on 31 January 
to showcase a multibarrel rocket system which would be part of 
the army's artillery, an aerial mine-laying system, and research 
into armor- piercing technology. It has been learned that army 
authorities are currently evaluating the various aspects of the 
system. 
  An official from the Chungshan Science Institute said the 
newly developed multi-barrel rocket system for army artillery 
resembles the current Kung-4 Rocket. It has been designed with 
reference to the MLR system [MLRS] of the United States Army, 
but built to meet the needs of the ROC. It has the capability 
to inflict heavy casualties on an invading fleet and on any 
enemy personnel who try to launch an offensive as they approach 
shore. 
  The 12-barrel rocket launcher can be hooked up with radar, 
computers, and a firing control vehicle to automatically 
determine various firing positions and directions within a range 
of 45 kilometers. It has a firing angle which covers from zero 
to 60 degrees and a direction range of plus or minus 120 
degrees, specifications which are superior to the MLRS range of 
110 degrees which is used by the U.S. military. When fitted 
with MK30 or MK40 rocket missile warheads, the unit is capable 
of powerful penetration and inflicting heavy casualties. 
  A researcher from the institute said the aerial mine-laying 
system had the advantage of being equipped with an automatic 
control, and can carry out mine-laying operations with great 
speed over a large area. According to on-the-spot testing 
results, each sortie could cover an area up to 3,000 square 
feet; and the anti-tank mine, which explodes within 30 seconds 
of falling to the ground, can cause casualties to enemy tank 
personnel within three meters of the mine, and pierce through 
the six-inch base and caterpillar tracks of an armored car. The 
system could, therefore, be effectively used to delay an enemy's 
landing and advance, thereby serving as an anti-landing 
operations weapon.

  [Text] In view of the intention by some legislators of the 
Legislative Yuan to stall the Army headquarters' listed budget 
for purchasing M60-A3 tanks eliminated by the U.S. Armed Forces, 
Army Commander-in-Chief Li Chen-lin said on 31 January that in 
order to fill the gaps in the Armored Force's combat capability, 
the Army is still actively seeking funds to buy M60-A3 tanks in 
a hope to immediately acquire and place them in war preparedness 
condition. 
  The Army commander-in-chief made the above remark in an 
interview with media during his inspection of the training and 
maintenance of AH-1W attack helicopters and OH-58D combat search 
helicopters at the Lungtan Base, which were purchased by the 
Army last year. 
  According to him, the M60-A3 tanks eliminated by the U.S. 
forces in South Korea are equipped not only with the shooting 
capabilities for night combat and march but also communications 
equipment and parts and components; and the U.S. asking price of 
NT$15 million per tank is rather economical. 
  He added: M60-A3 tanks are compatible with Yonghu M-48H 
tanks, the main force of tanks currently used by our country, in 
their systems; and there will be no problem of maintenance. 
Moreover, after being transported to our country, the tanks can 
be immediately placed in war preparedness condition and will be 
very helpful for filling the gaps in the Armored Force's combat 
capability. 
  As for some legislators' "misgivings" about purchasing 
"used" 
tanks, the commander-in-chief said the Army would continue to 
explain to and communicate with the Legislative Yuan in a hope 
to gain its support for the budget. 
  Major Chia, director of the Army's Logistics Department, 
also 
revealed that upon learning the U.S. forces' plan to streamline 
troops and equipment of U.S. forces in South Korea last August, 
the Armored Force dispatched experts to South Korea to conduct 
an on-the-spot examination of the M60-A3 tanks to be eliminated. 
According to the major, after assessment by the experts, the 
Army has decided to purchase 160 such tanks to upgrade the 
M48-A3 tanks currently used by one of the two motorized 
divisions while letting the other division continue to use the 
old-type M48-A3 tanks. It is understood that after learning 
about the plan to streamline U.S. forces in South Korea, Egypt, 
which already possesses 750 M60-A3 tanks, has also expressed its 
eagerness to purchase the tanks from the U.S. forces. The Army 
plans to take this rare opportunity to first purchase 160 such 
tanks and, after reviewing the actual situation, assess the 
possibility of buying more for upgrading the other motorized 
division.

<F P=106> [By reporter Huang Wei (7806 1218)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- While inspecting the New 
Technology Industrial Development and Experimental Zone in 
Beijing today, Song Jian, state councillor and minister in 
charge of the State Science and Technology Commission, said one 
of the strategic tasks at present is to vigorously develop a 
number of large, privately managed science and technology 
enterprises with great research and development potential, large 
production scale, and strong market-development capability, and 
to rapidly bring this science and technology "field army" onto 
the international market and take part in international 
competition. 
  Today, accompanied by Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan, Song Jian 
visited the work site of the Land Information Industry Base 
inside the New Technology Industrial Development and 
Experimental Zone in Beijing and discussed with entrepreneurs 
from privately-run science and technology enterprises. Before 
discussions got underway, Song Jian extended Spring Festival 
greetings to the entrepreneurs on behalf of the State Council 
and the State Science and Technology Commission. He said 
management at the Beijing Experimental Zone, by taking advantage 
of the state's preferential policy and by adopting an flexible 
operating mechanism, has seen rapid development in the zone. In 
it there were now a number of science and technology enterprises 
including the Stone Group, Lianxiang, Fangzheng, Jinghai, 
Huasheng, Huake which had attracted attention both inside and 
outside China. The Beijing Experimental Zone was taking the 
lead among the nation's 52 science and technology development 
zones. 
  Song Jian said one of the results of China's reform of the 
science and technology structure was the vigorous search for and 
development of different types of privately run science and 
technology enterprises. Privately run science and technology 
enterprises, which had emerged in large numbers lately, had 
become the driving force for developing the cause of science and 
technology and for the science and technology industry, and had 
become an important part of the socialist market economy. 
Private operations would remain the main form of enterprise in 
China's science and technology development zones in the future. 
The state would continue to work toward the rapid development 
of big, privately run enterprises engaged in the development of 
new and high technology. 
  Song Jian also expressed the hope that operators of 
privately 
run enterprises, as commanders of the "field army" of China's 
rising science and technology industry, would work out 
strategies and be prepared to wage a major campaign. For 
privately run enterprises to develop, it was necessary for them 
to persist in developing high technology; to train their own 
research and development personnel; to rely on science and 
technology to get ahead of others in market competition; to 
maintain and develop superiority; to rapidly expand production 
and scale of operation and enhance economic strength; to develop 
the international market and take part in international 
competition through cooperation with financial institutions and 
with domestic or foreign counterparts; to further improve 
enterprise management; to study advanced foreign management 
theories, systems, and methods; and to train professional 
management personnel so that the production and operation of 
enterprises would be adapted to the requirements of socialist 
production. 
  In conclusion, Song Jian said that to promote the 
development 
of high technology industry, and to bring about the launch of 
China's national economy mainly through reliance on the new and 
high technology industry, the state would adopt measures to 
create a more relaxed environment for the development of new and 
high technology industry development zones and encourage more 
scientists and technicians, scientific research institutes, and 
institutes of higher education to run private high technology 
enterprises.

  [Excerpts] Shanghai, 12 Feb (WEN WEI PO) -- On the eve of 
the Lunar New Year, Shanghai residents learned from television 
programs that Deng Xiaoping would once again join them in 
spending the spring festival. This was the seventh consecutive 
time he did so since 1988. [passage omitted] 
  It was on the afternoon of 9 February (that is, on the eve 
of 
the Lunar New Year) that Deng Xiaoping gathered happily with 
Shanghai's senior-level persons such as Wu Bangguo and Wang Ju. 
Deng Nan and Xiao Rong, Deng Xiaoping's two daughters, held his 
arms [chan fu 2356 2105] on the left and right as he walked into 
the reception room to shake hands with Wu Bangguo and Wang Ju, 
who had waited there. Compared with last year, Deng Xiaoping 
was slightly thinner. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Li Peng Left Shenzhen for Huizhou To </F>
Inspect Daya Bay Development Zone"] 
  [Text] According to sources, Chinese Premier Li Peng 
finished his three-day inspection in Shenzhen and left for 
Huizhou yesterday morning. Li Peng will inspect the Daya Bay 
Development Zone inside Huizhou City and inquire about the 
suspended project of Xiongmao [Panda] Car City. 
  The sources yesterday said that during his stay in Shenzhen, 
Li Peng inspected many places including the Guangzhou-Shenzhen 
Express Highway which has been opened to traffic and the 
Huanggang Border Pass. 
  Yesterday morning, Huizhou Mayor Li Jinwei and other local 
officials particularly went to Shenzhen to meet Li Peng and his 
entourage. Li Peng continued his inspection tour in the company 
of Xie Fei, secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, 
Zhu Senlin, governor of the province, and Huizhou Mayor Li 
Jinwei. 
  The sources said that during his visit to Huizhou, Li Peng 
will listen to local leaders' work reports and will once again 
inspect the Daya Bay Development Zone which is under 
construction. 
  The Daya Bay Development Zone is one of the major 
construction projects to which the central authorities attach 
importance. It includes the the infrastructural project of 
Huizhou Harbor, a large deepwater harbor, and two major 
industrial projects--Nanhai Petrochemical and Xiongmao Motors. 
The former is a large-scale joint venture launched by Nanhai 
Petroleum Corporation with China Merchant's Steamboat Navigation 
Company and the Shell Oil Company; and the latter is an 
investment project launched by South Korea's Tongyi [4827 0001] 
Group. The plants were built but the project was suspended 
because of a dispute over the proportion of cars to be exported. 
Some plants were rented to China's No 2 Motors as assembly 
workshops. 
  Huizhou City and the Daya Bay Development Zone are both key 
areas for development in Guangdong. Guangdong once announced 
that: "Development in the 1980's was focused on Shenzhen and 
development in the 1990's will be focused on Huizhou." Jiang 
Zemin, Li Peng, Yang Shangkun, Wan Li, and Zou Jiahua in turn 
have previously inspected Huizhou. 
  According to the sources, during his inspection of Huizhou, 
it is likely that Li Peng will make a final decision on the 
future of Xiongmao Motors. 
  On the other hand, China's official XINHUA News Agency 
yesterday, for the first time, revealed Li Peng's recent 
inspection of Zhuhai by issuing a special feature about Li 
Peng's visit to Juren [Giant] Enterprise Group, a high-tech 
enterprise run by unofficial institutions.

"When Visiting PLA Units Stationed in Shanxi, Chairman Jiang 
Zemin Encourages Officers and Men To Set Store by the People's 
Interests and take Pride in Rendering Service to the Motherland"] 
  [Text] Taiyuan, 3 Feb (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--During his 
inspection trip in Shanxi, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the 
CPC Central Committee, president of the People's Republic of 
China, and chairman of the Central Military Commission, paid 
separate visits to PLA units garrisoned in Shanxi under the 
State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for 
National Defense and the Beijing Military Region on behalf of 
the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central 
Military Commission. During his visits, he expressed his deep 
concern about and extended Spring Festival greetings to the 
officers and men of the entire army. He urged the vast numbers 
of officers and men to place the interest of the people above 
everything else, to take pride in rendering services to the 
motherland, and to help each other on the way ahead. Cadres 
should take good care of soldiers, veterans should help new 
recruits, and newcomers should show respect for their superiors. 
All officers and men should unite as one, strengthen political 
studies, do a good job in military training, and build the 
troops into combat collectives which are able to pass the 
strictest tests. 
  Carrier rocket launchers towered aloft on the uncultivated 
loess plateau. This is the place where the troops under the 
State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for 
National Defense work hard year in and year out, and they have 
scored one victory after another in the spirit of hard struggle 
and selfless contribution. Chairman Jiang chose this place as 
his first stop on his Shanxi trip. In the early morning of 29 
January, the temperature dropped to minus 18 degrees centigrade, 
and all the hills were covered with a thin layer of snow. As 
soon as he got off the train, braving the cold, Chairman Jiang 
enthusiastically inspected all the major equipment on the base 
and inquired about the progress of scientific research and 
experiments. He then entered a workshop and cordially met with 
the base's cadres at the regimental level and above. Seeing 
that Chairman Jiang was walking toward them, these cadres, who 
were engaged in high-tech work under difficult working and 
living conditions, found it hard to control their emotion and 
burst into warm applause. 
  Jiang Zemin said sentimentally: Conditions here are very 
difficult. You people have worked and lived here for many years 
on end and have made significant contributions to the 
modernization of national defense. The party and people are 
grateful to you. Turning to Shanxi Provincial Party Secretary Hu 
Fuguo and acting Governor Sun Wensheng who accompanied him 
during the trip, Jiang Zemin said: Communications are not 
convenient and conditions are not very good here. Our troops on 
this base have faced many difficulties in their lives, and the 
young comrades are also faced with difficulty in finding a 
suitable spouse. I hope that the local party committees and 
governments can do their best to help our troops solve 
difficulties back at home so that they can concentrate their 
energy on their work and make greater contributions. 
  What Chairman Jiang said warmed the hearts of all those 
present, and they responded with warm applause. Chairman Jiang 
walked to the front of a rank and shook hands and talked with 
the scientific cadres standing in the front row. People 
extended greetings to Chairman Jiang, who also waved greetings 
to the comrades standing in the back row. 
  Chairman Jiang always has the welfare of the troops at 
heart. 
During his entire inspection of Shanxi, he spoke more than once 
about ways to improve the living standards of our troops with Fu 
Quanyou, member of the Central Military Commission and director 
of the PLA General Logistics Department, and Li Laizhu, 
commander of the Beijing Military Region, who accompanied him 
during the inspection. As soon as he arrived in a new Army 
unit, Chairman Jiang would inquire about its agricultural and 
sideline production and the welfare of the rank and file. On 
the morning of 1 February, Chairman Jiang paid a special visit 
to the officers and men of a military farm under a group army 
when he was inspecting the development of the Huang He shoals in 
Yuncheng Prefecture. 
  On the afternoon of 1 February, Chairman Jiang rushed to 
visit a certain tank regiment. At the training site, when the 
tank operators, who were receiving training at the time, and the 
new recruits saw Chairman Jiang, they quickly fell into lines 
for him to inspect. When coming to the row of the fifth squad 
of the second company of new recruits by the side of the tank 
number 511, Chairman Jiang shook hands with the soldiers one 
after another, asked them about the training, and asked them how 
they were doing. Afterward, the chairman entered the new 
recruits' dormitory and the company kitchen and asked the 
soldiers about the food. He was very happy when he saw that the 
windows were clean and the quilts were folded up properly in the 
dormitory of the new recruits of the first company. He asked 
the soldiers whether they would have recreational activities 
during the spring festival and whether they were homesick. When 
they unanimously said that they were comfortable being in 
service, he smiled with relief. He also encouraged the officers 
and men of this regiment to strengthen solidarity, study 
diligently, train hard, and improve their own quality and the 
troops' fighting capacity in a comprehensive way. 
  A certain infantry regiment once acted as guard for the 
Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee. 
With diligent efforts, their officers and men have made fairly 
big progress in material and cultural life in recent years. On 
the afternoon of 2 February, Chairman Jiang inspected the 
regiment's livelihood service center, where he found 22 
different kinds of vegetables and types of food to supply the 
various companies. Chairman Jiang carefully inquired about the 
prices of various kinds of vegetables and types of food. 
Soldiers at the service center told Chairman Jiang that they 
processed the bean curd, bean sprouts, and dried bean curd 
themselves; that they raised and slaughtered the pigs 
themselves; and that they grew some of the vegetables which were 
relatively inexpensive. After he heard this, Chairman Jiang 
praised them several times. Chairman Jiang also visited a 
workshop where fried dough and pastries were made and dumplings 
were made by machines. He saw how the soldiers made more than 
100 pickled vegetables and how the cooks skillfully prepared the 
food with their knives. Later, he entered the "Home of the 
Company Quarter Master." When he found that they used strict 
auditing measures to ensure that the food expenditures were 
fully used by the soldiers, he praised this by nodding his head 
repeatedly. 
  In Taiyuan, Chairman Jiang met with PLA cadres at and above 
the divisional level stationed there. He gave important 
instructions regarding the question of studies. He said: 
Building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
invigorating China is a great task before us. In order to 
complete this task, we must continue to struggle arduously and 
make efforts to consolidate our studies. All our officers and 
men must first study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and his thinking about 
army building during the new period, and they should use them as 
a guide for all of our work. Following the development of 
science and technology, new technologies and new knowledge keep 
coming. All cadres of the troops should consolidate the study 
of new technologies and new knowledge, especially basic 
high-tech knowledge, and should continuously improve their 
skills so as to meet the needs of the new situation and new 
tasks. 
  Some leaders of the relevant ministries of the central 
authorities also accompanied General Secretary Jiang on his 
working and troop inspection tour, including Zeng Qinghong, Ye 
Qing, Liu Jiang, Han Zhubin, Zhang Youcai, Teng Wensheng, and 
Yang Yongzhe.

  [Excerpts] Some 10,000 people of various nationalities 
from Pahataikeli village, Shufu County, Kashi Prefecture, in an 
excited and exuberant mood, yesterday gathered solemnly in (word 
indistinct) to welcome General Secretary Jiang Zemin's reply 
letter to the farmers of this village. 
  Abulaidi Amudurexiti, deputy secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Regional CPC committee and acting chairman of the 
autonomous region, and Amudun Niyaz, chairman of the standing 
committee of the autonomous regional people's congress, attended 
the rally. [Video shows Abulaidi Amudurexiti and other leaders 
walking toward a big square where the rally is held. Abulaidi 
Amudurexiti is seen speaking to the standing crowd in the big 
square.] 
  Abulaidi Amudurexiti first read out General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin's reply letter to the farmers of Pahataikeli village, 
Shufu County. The letter reads: I extend my congratulations to 
you for your display of patriotism, efforts for expanding 
production by relying on own efforts and hard working, and 
gratifying achievements in improving your material and cultural 
life over the 40 years or so under the encouragement of Chairman 
Mao's letter. In the new historical period and under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line, and the 
leadership of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional CPC 
Committee, I hope you will continue to implement the guidelines 
of the 14th CPC Congress, enhance national unity, be bold in 
blazing new trails and advancing forward, accelerate economic 
development, do a good job in constructing material and 
spiritual civilization, achieve the standards of a comfortable 
life as soon as possible, and build your hometown into a 
prosperous socialist new village. 
  Abulaidi Amudurexiti said that last August, farmers of 
Pahataikeli village, to mark Comrade Mao Zedong's 100th birth 
anniversary and to celebrate the 41st anniversary of Comrade Mao 
Zedong's personal reply to [word indistinct], entrusted Vice 
Chairman Seypidin Aze to take a letter to General Secretary Jiang 
  Zemin in which the farmers expressed their confidence of 
realizing the goal of leading a comfortable life and of building 
their village into a new and thriving socialist rural area, as 
well as the best wishes for General Secretary Jiang Zemin. 
  Despite his hectic work schedule, General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin recently replied to the farmers' letter. His reply fully 
affirmed the concern shown by the CPC Central Committee and by 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin for the farmers in Pahataikeli 
village, as well as toward various nationalities in Xinjiang, 
which has a very important significance to promoting the rapid 
and efficient development of the Xinjiang economy and to 
maintaining the national unity and social and political 
stability. This letter is not only a major event for the 
farmers in Pahataikeli village but also a big event in the 
political life of all nationalities in the region. This is not 
only a big encouragement to all the farmers in Pahataikeli 
village but also a big encouragement to all the people of 
various nationalities in the entire region. 
  Abulaiti Amudurexiti said since liberation the party and the 
state have attached great importance and showed concern for the 
economic development in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. 
They have formulated a series of preferential policies to 
promote the all-round progress of various undertakings in the 
areas inhabited by ethnic minorities and rendered great support 
and assistance in terms of finance, materials, and manpower. 
The party committee and the people's government of the 
autonomous region attach great importance to the economic 
development in the prefectures in south Xinjiang and have 
formulated a series of policies for accelerated development of 
the economy in those areas. Over the past several decades, 
thanks to the joint efforts of all nationalities in the entire 
region, various socialist undertakings in Xinjiang have 
witnessed great development; reform and opening up and economic 
construction have achieved new progress; economy has developed; 
political situation is stable; people of various nationalities 
show solidarity; society has progressed; and various 
undertakings have achieved gratifying results. He expressed the 
hope that Pahataikeli village's party committee, people's 
government, and farmers of various nationalities, under the 
direct leadership of Kashi Prefecture's party committee, 
commissioner, and of Shufu County's party committee and the 
people's government, will formulate plans, advance measures, 
seriously implement the guidelines laid down at the 14th CPC 
National Congress and at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, resolutely implement the resolutions 
adopted at the sixth plenary and enlarged meeting of the 
autonomous region's fourth CPC committee, strive to realize 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin's earnest expectations which he 
expressed in his reply letter, realize the goal of leading a 
comfortable life as soon as possible, and build our village into 
a new and thriving socialist rural area. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hefei, February 11 (XINHUA) -- Wherever you travel 
across the country, you are likely to find farmers from Anhui 
Province working on construction sites, in markets or fields, or 
serving as housekeepers. 
  Many of them came from poor and remote areas of Anhui, and 
received technical training before going out to work. 
  While guiding farmers to work outside Anhui in a planned 
way, 
this east China province has set up more than 3,000 small towns 
specially for farmers. 
  More than five million people from the pool of surplus labor 
in the province were transferred to work in the urban areas last 
year. 
  One of China's major agricultural producers, Anhui has about 
50 million farmers. 
  To deal properly with its pool of surplus rural labor, Anhui 
has focused on boosting high-yield and efficient agriculture and 
rural industrial enterprises and accelerated the development of 
small towns. 
  Its township and village enterprises generated an output 
value totalling 110 billion yuan last year, an increase of 51.2 
billion yuan over the previous year, and the production output 
of livestock, poultry and aquatic products also registered a big 
increase. 
  A local official noted that the small towns have become 
industrial, trade, political and cultural centers in rural areas. 
  At present the province has 4,126 markets and fairs, ten of 
which each have transactions topping 100 million yuan a year. 
  Local governments also keep regularly in touch with cities 
outside the province, providing information for those farmers 
who want to find jobs there. They also offer training sessions 
for those farmers. 
  According to statistics from the provincial post service, 
local farmers working outside Anhui sent back more than 100 
million yuan to their families every month last year, mostly 
from coastal cities. 
  Many farmers have become successful businessmen locally 
after 
working in cities for several years.

Taiwan arrived at Bali island of Indonesia for a "vacational 
visit" and on February 11, Indonesian President Suharto met with 
Li on the island, according to sources of the Foreign Ministry.

<F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>
  [Text] President Li Teng-hui began an eight-day Southeast 
Asian tour Wednesday [9 February] despite a warning against the 
trip by Beijing. The diplomatically sensitive trip, which takes 
Li to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand, is designed to 
strengthen Taiwan's economic and political ties with the three 
countries in the absence of formal diplomatic relations. 
  An official statement released by the presidential office 
Wednesday said the main purpose of the president's unofficial 
visit is to learn from other's experience as the reference for 
the ROC economic development in the 21st century, adding that Li 
will have unofficial contacts with leaders in the region 
touching [on] views on regional economic cooperation and matters 
of major concern. 
  Li arrived at the former U.S. naval base at Subic Bay in the 
Philippines at 1045 where he made a three-hour visit and held 
informal talks with the Philippine President Fidel Ramos over a 
luncheon, the semiofficial CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  The tour is Li's second overseas trip since assuming office 
in 1988. He visited Singapore in 1989, the first time a 
president of the Republic of China had gone abroad in 12 years. 
  After leaving the Philippines, the president's chartered 
plane landed in Indonesia's resort island of Bali Wednesday 
evening where he planned to discuss the development of natural 
gas and oil reserves. Among other projects was President 
Suharto of Indonesia and tour Indonesia's aerospace center. 
[sentence as received] During his visit in Indonesia, he will 
also meet with Indonesia's Research and Technology Minister 
Habibie for talks focusing on the development of Bantam, an 
island south of Singapore which Jakarta is developing as an 
industrial zone, the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY reported. Li was 
accompanied by the ROC First Lady Tseng Wen-hui and about 40 
officials including Frederick Chien, minister of foreign 
affairs; Vincent Siew, chairman of the Council for Economic 
Planning and Development; Raymond Tai, presidential spokesman; 
Jeffrey Wu, an adviser to the Executive Yuan; and Liu Ta-yi, an 
adviser to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, according to 
officials. 
  The presidential delegation will then travel to Phuket, in 
Thailand, on 14th February to meet with Thai prime minister, the 
local press reported. 
  Taiwan is already one of the biggest foreign investors in 
Southeast Asia, pouring in more than $10 billion so far. Li's 
trip is also seen by local analysts as a part of the 
government's recently-announced southward policy designed to 
promote economic and trade ties with ASEAN countries in order to 
release Taiwan's dependence on Mainland China. 
  The Philippine President Fidel Ramos said Thursday that 
meeting with the ROC President Li Teng-hui does not violate the 
one-China principle practiced by his country, and the meeting 
with President Li was a very valuable time when the ideas and 
issues were discussed informally in the meeting, he said, and 
they were able to discuss further proceedings for the ROC 
investment in the Philippines. Ramos was also able to verify 
the date for the construction work to begin in the Taiwanese 
industrial zone within the Subic Bay. Ramos emphasized this 
project is of great importance to the development of the Subic 
Bay. The two sides have also consented to have the third 
economic cooperation meeting taking place in Subic Bay in June 
this year. 
  Meanwhile, as President Li arrived in Bali island in 
Indonesia, great interest was also aroused among the local 
media. Indonesia's newspapers quoted words from Indonesia's 
Foreign Minister Alatas that the ROC President Li Teng-hui as a 
Ph.D. in agricultural economy and not representing his official 
position as the president of the Republic of China. [sentence as 
received] Indonesia therefore is not violating the one-China 
policy with the Mainland China.

  [Text] United Nations, February 14 (XINHUA) -- China said 
here today that it was opposed to the use or threat of force in 
resolving the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  Speaking at a Security Council meeting on the situation in 
Bosnia, Chen Jian, China's deputy representative to the United 
Nations, said that the international community should "act very 
prudently and refrain from taking any hasty action." 
  He said that at a time when the peace process for Bosnia was 
at a crucial juncture, taking further military actions would by 
no means help achieve political solution. 
  "On the contrary," he said, "it will only entail negative 
consequences." 
  With regard to the use of air power in that country, Chen 
said, China believed it should be limited to the self-defense by 
the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslav 
republic. 
  As for the possible serious consequences of the use of air 
strikes on the safety of UNPROFOR personnel and the humanitarian 
relief activities in the Balkan country, Chen said that "we 
cannot but express anxiety and concern." 
  The eventual settlement of the Bosnian crisis, Chen said, 
should continue to be sought within the framework of the 
principles set forth by the international conference on the 
former Yugoslavia and relevant Security Council resolutions and 
through peaceful negotiations so as to ensure a lasting, fair 
and reasonable solution that could guarantee the fundamental 
interests of various parties and could be accepted by all. 
  "The parties concerned in Bosnia and Herzegovina have 
recently held several rounds of talks," Chen said, and "we hope 
all the endeavors of the international community will genuinely 
help promote the peace process towards the political settlement."

  [Text] United Nations, 14 Feb (XINHUA) -- Chen Jian, 
Chinese deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, 
said at the UN Security Council today that taking further 
military actions in Bosnia-Herzegovina may entail negative 
consequences rather than aid a political settlement of the 
conflict there. 
  He said: The use of air power in Bosnia-Herzegovina should 
be limited to the defense of the UN Protection Forces 
[Unprofor]. China cannot help but express anxiety and concern 
about the serious consequences which the air strikes may cause 
for the safety of Unprofor personnel and their humanitarian 
relief activities. The international community should act very 
prudently and refrain from taking any hasty action. 
  Over 200 civilians have died or were wounded in Sarajevo, 
the 
capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as result of a shelling incident 
there on 5 February. On 9 February, NATO issued an ultimatum to 
the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina in which it warned 
them to remove their heavy weapons 20 km from Sarajevo or turn 
them over to the United Nations within 10 days, otherwise they 
would be subject to NATO air strikes. 
  The UN Security Council meeting today was called at the 
request of Russia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Pakistan. The 
representatives of over 50 countries demanded to take the floor 
on the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation. 
  Chen Jian said: China is opposed to the use of force, or the 
threat to use force, in resolving the conflict. He said: "The 
eventual settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue should 
continue to be sought within the framework of the principles set 
out by the international conference on the former Yugoslavia and 
relevant Security Council resolutions and through peaceful 
negotiations so as to ensure a lasting, fair, and reasonable 
solution that can guarantee the fundamental interests of the 
various parties and that can be accepted by all." 
  In his speech, French Ambassador Merimee reiterated that the 
warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina should place their heavy 
weapons under UN control, otherwise they will be subject to air 
strikes. He added that France endorsed Russia's proposal for 
placing Sarajevo under UN control. 
  Russian Ambassador Vorontsov said that the UN Security 
Council should come up with an "appropriate decision" so that 
its previous resolutions on a cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and the removal of heavy weapons can be carried out.

  [Text] United Nations, February 14 (XINHUA) -- UN Security 
Council members today strongly urged an end to the siege of 
Sarajevo, with some stressing the use of force while others 
advocating dialogue and negotiation. 
  The debate took place in an urgent meeting, which was called 
at the request of the Russian Federation, Bosnia and Herzegovina 
and Pakistan. 
  Participants in the debate are ambassadors of the 15 council 
members and representatives of 38 UN member states, including 
Belgium, Hungary, Colombia and Senegal, which are interested in 
the discussion. 
  Jean-Bernard Merimee, French ambassador to the UN, said that 
"the conflict (in Bosnia) has now reached a turning point, which 
we should all be aware of." 
  The first priority, he said, was to lift the siege of 
Sarajevo, begin its demilitarization and progress toward placing 
that city under temporary UN administration. 
  However, he stressed, this must not interfere with the 
recent 
NATO decision demanding the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their 
heavy weapons from Sarajevo before February 20 or face air 
strikes. 
  Bosnia's UN Ambassador Muhamed Secirbegovic said the 
precedent set by the NATO threat was only a first step and he 
called for the lifting of the siege around five other Muslim 
cities designated as UN "safe areas." 
  He said relevant Security Council resolutions did not 
require 
any further action by the council, and "the withdrawal of the 
Serbian forces and their weapons should be executed fully in a 
timely manner." 
  Chen Jian, China's UN ambassador, said at the debate that 
the 
Chinese Government is opposed to the use or threat of force. 
  On NATO's threat of force, Chen said that NATO should "act 
very prudently and refrain from taking any hasty action." 
  With regard to the use of air power in Bosnia, Chen said 
that 
it should be limited to self-defense by the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) in that country. 
  The eventual settlement of the Bosnian crisis, Chen said, 
should continue to be sought in accordance with the principles 
set forth by the International Conference on the Former 
Yugoslavia and relevant Security Council resolutions. 
  "The parties concerned in Bosnia and Hercegovina have 
recently held several rounds of talks," the Chinese ambassador 
said. "We hope all the endeavors of the international community 
will genuinely help promote the peace process toward a political 
settlement." 
  Russia's Ambassador, Yuliy Vorontsov, also spoke of a 
political settlement, saying that "it is essential to time and 
again spell out our support for the negotiating procedure in 
order to reach a settlement to the Bosnian conflict as a whole." 
  In view of the fact that previous ceasefire agreements and 
other agreements between the parties had frequently broken down, 
Vorontsov said, "it is obviously extremely important for the 
Security Council to back up its demands by a proper decision for 
a ceasefire and a withdrawal of heavy weapons in and around 
Sarajevo." 
  Madeleine Albright, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, 
said during the debate that diplomacy alone was not enough and 
it must be backed by a willingness to use force. 
  "It is only force plus diplomacy that can stop the slaughter 
in Sarajevo and break the stalemate in Geneva," she added. 
  However, the U.S. ambassador said, her government believed 
the Bosnian conflict should be resolved at the negotiating 
table, not on the battlefield. 
  "Neither NATO, nor this council," she said, "can or should 
impose a settlement upon the parties, for an imposed settlement 
will not be a lasting settlement."

  [Text] Paris, February 14 (XINHUA) -- NATO's ultimatum to 
Bosnian warring sides "will not be prolonged for a single day," 
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said on Television France 
2 Monday [14 February] evening. 
  On February 9, the 16 countries of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) passed an ultimatum demanding the warring 
parties in Bosnia to lift the siege of Sarajevo and withdraw or 
put under UN control all the heavy weapons within a 20-kilometer 
range of the city before a 10-day deadline. 
  NATO will launch air strikes on the mortar positions that do 
not respect the ultimatum. 
  Balladur hoped that the Bosnian warring sides would conform 
to NATO's demand and "return to the negotiating table." 
  "If they don't," he stressed, "it goes without saying that 
what has been said will be done." 
  Balladur said that his government was deeply concerned with 
the situation of the French peace-keeping troops in Bosnia, who 
are on an "extremely dangerous" humanitarian mission. 
  He said that the government would "take every measure to 
ensure their security." 
  The latest statistics showed that by February 1 this year, a 
total of 10,760 soldiers of the UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) 
were stationed in Bosnia, 4,077 of whom were French. 
  Balladur said that France accounts for the largest share in 
the UNPROFOR but it would be "meaningless" for them to continue 
their presence if the fightings there "should go on for five, 
ten or even 15 years."

  [Text] United Nations, February 14 (XINHUA) -- France today 
again warned the warring parties in Bosnia to place their heavy

  Speaking at a UN Security Council session on Bosnia, France 
Ambassador to the United Nations, Jean-Bernard Merimee, said 
"the conflict has now reached a turning point, which we should 
all be aware of." 
  Interpreting the NATO decision on Bosnia adopted on February 
9, the ambassador said the decision essentially aimed to have 
heavy weapons placed under UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
control within 10 days, and "those weapons positions that had 
not been withdrawn would be subject to air strikes." 
  He said the decision had the sole aim of providing the 
United 
Nations with the means of implementing the decisions of the 
Security Council. 
  The first priority, he said, was to lift the siege of 
Sarajevo, begin its demilitarization and progress towards 
placing that city under temporary UN administration. 
  The ambassador said France shared the objective put forward 
by Russia on placing Sarajevo under UN administration, but that 
must not interfere with the recent NATO decision. 
  However, he said, his government was fully prepared to 
support all efforts to achieve peace through negotiations, and 
"the time has come for us all to come out in favor of peace."

  On the ten-day deadline for the withdrawal or placement 
under 
UN control of heavy weapons of the warring parties in Bosnia, 
Albright said that NATO would respond in coordination with the 
United Nations to the artillery or mortar fire that had wreaked 
the havoc in Sarajevo on February 5. 
  "These decisions are consistent with resolutions approved by 
this council," she said, and "they do not require further 
council action." 
  Observers here noted that the statement was in sharp 
contrast 
with that of her Russian counterpart Yuriy Vorontsov, who said 
at the same meeting that "the Security Council should back up 
its demands by a proper decision." 
  The U.S. ambassador also said that her government believed

  "Neither NATO, nor this council," she said, "can or should

will not be a lasting settlement." 
  However, she added, by seeking to reduce the level of 
violence around Sarajevo, her government hoped to reinvigorate 
and lend substance to the negotiating process.

  [Text] United Nations, February 14 (XINHUA) -- Russia's UN 
Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov today said that a "proper decision" 
by the Security Council is necessary to back up its previous 
demands for a settlement of conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  His remarks came at a Security Council meeting which the 
Russian Federation, Bosnia and Hercegovina and Pakistan 
requested to convene to discuss the situation in the former 
Yugoslav republic. 
  "In view of the fact that previous ceasefire agreements and 
other agreements between the parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
in the past have frequently broken down," Vorontsov said, "it is 
obviously extremely important for the Security Council to back 
up its demands by a proper decision" for a cease-fire and a 
withdrawal of heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo. 
  "We believe that it is essential to time and again spell out 
our support for the negotiating procedure in order to reach a 
settlement to the Bosnian conflict as a whole," he said. 
  Stating that it is now very important to urge all three 
parties to the conflict to reach a compromise, the ambassador 
said "we will continue to cooperate with the European Union and 
the United States in an attempt to find a peaceful settlement. 
  On February 5, a mortar shell explosion in an open market in 
Sarajevo killed 68 civilians and wounding 197, worsening the 
situation in the Bosnian capital, which had been besieged by 
Bosnian Serbs for 22 months. 
  Last Wednesday, NATO agreed to a request by UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to use air-strike to 
silent heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo.

  [Text] Madrid, February 14 (XINHUA) -- Spain would not join 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in its possible 
air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions, Foreign Minister 
Javier Solana said today. 
  He explained that NATO, which has enough warplanes to carry 
out the air strikes, would not need Spain's participation. 
  NATO has threatened to launch air strikes against Bosnian 
Serb gun positions around Sarajevo unless the Serbs withdraw 
their weapons or surrender them to UN control by midnight GMT on 
Sunday. 
  The Bosnian Serbs were accused of launching a mortar attack 
on a Sarajevo market earlier this month. The attack, which 
killed 68 civilians and wounded nearly 200 others, led to 
renewed calls for NATO's air strikes against Bosnian Serb gun 
positions around Sarajevo. 
  Solana expressed the hope that the United Nations and NATO 
would seek an end to the Bosnian war without resorting to force. 
  He was speaking to reporters before departure for a visit to 
Andorra. 
  Solana also urged the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy 
weapons from around Sarajevo in a step "to actually lift the 
siege of the city." 
  He said he had called on the United States, France, Britain 
and Russia to help end the siege of Sarajevo through promoting 
negotiations involving the warring parties.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Yang Huasheng (2799 5478 0581): "Why </F>
Can They Not Reach Agreement in the Talks? -- On the Differences 
Between Western Countries on the Bosnian Issue"] 
  [Text] As the war in Bosnia has been continuously 
accelerated over the past few days, France, Britain, and the 
United States have differed greatly over the questions of how to 
start air strikes and how to exert pressure on all parties to 
the Bosnian conflict. In late January, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher held talks with the French president, prime 
minister, and foreign minister in Paris. The two sides, 
however, stuck to their own views and the talks failed in 
discord. The results of the talks between British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd and the U.S. secretary of state in 
Washington on 3 February again proved that Britain was unable to 
change the set U.S. policy on the Bosnian issue. The 
differences between the United States and Britain and France 
over the Bosnian conflict are difficult to resolve. 
  So what are the differences between the Western countries 
over the Bosnian conflict? 
  Regarding the question of whether resolving the Bosnian 
crisis by force or through talks, it is not only that the 
European countries differ from the United States, but that 
European countries differ among themselves. France and Britain 
argued that the way to resolve the Bosnian conflict is by 
greatly enhancing the strength of the peacekeeping troops and 
forcing all parties to the Bosnian conflict to come to an 
agreement. Therefore, at the NATO summit earlier in January, 
France repeatedly urged the United States to send troops, but 
the United States has rejected this appeal all along with solemn 
statements. On this issue, owing to historical and political 
reasons, Germany does not agree to resolving the crisis by 
force. Not long ago, German Chancellor Kohl expressed clear 
doubts about the feasibility of publicly intervening in the 
Bosnian conflict by force. 
  On the question of whether or not to lift the embargo on 
arms 
supplies to the Bosnian Muslims, Washington repeatedly has 
favored lifting the embargo and has maintained that placing an 
arms embargo on the Muslims alone means encouraging the 
aggressors. Paris, however, has maintained that this will only 
compel the United Nations to withdraw its peacekeeping troops 
and allow the Bosnian conflict to spread. On 25 January, French 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said: "The United States will have 
to assume responsibility for the `catastrophe.'" The U.S. State 
Department immediately retorted, alleging that France's position 
on the Bosnian issue was "puzzling." Washington held that the 
Bosnian Muslims are victims in the conflict and that pressure 
should be exerted on Serbia first. 
  Europe and the United States have long had contradictions 
over the Yugoslav and Bosnian issues. At the very beginning, 
without consulting its allies, Germany was the first to 
acknowledge the independence of Slovenia and Croatia, and this 
compelled other EC countries to acknowledge the two countries. 
The United States has criticized this many times, maintaining 
that it is because of the recklessness of the Germans that the 
Yugoslav situation has gotten as bad as it is today. Moreover, 
the Americans hold that the Bosnian crisis should first be 
resolved by Europeans themselves, and ask why the Americans 
should be implicated now that trouble has broken out in the 
backyard of Europe? While the Americans favor launching air 
strikes at the Serbs, Britain and France are resolutely opposed, 
fearing their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia would be used as 
"hostages" and as bargaining chips. 
  Why are these contradictions and differences between the 
Western countries difficult to resolve? 
  Let us first analyze the U.S. position. We should say that 
on the Bosnian issue, the United States has taken a 
comparatively aloof position. At first, it warned other Western 
countries that they should act prudently. Last year, after 
becoming President, Clinton urged that the arms embargo on the 
Bosnian Muslims be lifted, and put forward the idea of launching 
air strikes at the Serbs, but Britain and France did not accept 
this. Since then, the United States has taken a "spectator's" 
stance on the Bosnian conflict and has not taken any specific 
action. At a time when Britain and France are strongly urging 
the United States to send troops, the United States has stated 
that it will never send troops to Bosnia because it maintains 
that the Bosnian conflict, which involves many complicated 
problems, cannot be resolved by force or else it will probably 
be aggravated. However, there is an underlying reason why the 
United States is opposed to sending troops: First, the United 
States sent peacekeeping troops to Somalia last year, got deeply 
bogged down, and had 18 U.S. soldiers killed there, leading to 
denouncements at home. Second, the Bosnian conflict directly 
concerns the security interests of Britain, France, and other 
European countries, and does not very much concern the other 
side of the Atlantic, so the United States does not want to get 
involved in a regional conflict that does not have much bearing 
on its own interests, nor does it want to take any unnecessary 
risks. That is why France obliquely criticized this U.S. 
position, saying that Washington has always taken an 
"indifferent [ge an guan huo 7133 1489 6034 3499]" stance.
