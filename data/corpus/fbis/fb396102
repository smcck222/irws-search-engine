  [Text] Beijing, February 15 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank (WB) 
extended 2.955 billion U.S. dollars in promised loans to China 
in 1993 for the country's 15 national projects, the Chinese 
Ministry of Finance disclosed here today. 
  This increased the world's largest inter-governmental 
financial organization's loans to China to 16.956 billion U.S. 
dollars for 131 national projects since the country re-entered 
the bank in 1985. 
  The funds have been directed into the basic industries of 
agriculture, transportation, energy and environmental 
protection, according to the Finance Ministry. 
  The World Bank's 490 million dollar loan to build China's 
food circulation network in 1993 was one of the largest lending 
projects in its 48-year history. 
  "The year 1993 witnessed the continued steady progress of 
cooperation between China and the World Bank," a spokesman for 
the Finance Ministry said. 
  He said China will still need funds, especially low-interest 
loans, from the World Bank "for a relatively long period of 
time," promising that China will make full use of the funds to 
reap the best results. 
  A national inspection of China's projects jointly conducted 
by the two sides early last year showed that China remained one 
of the best of the bank's 176 member countries in carrying out 
project plans. 
  Such credit has laid the groundwork for further large-scale 
loans from the World Bank to China according to the bank's 
lending policy based on project fulfillment, said the ministry 
spokesman. 
  China, even as a low-income developing country which 
receives 
international aid, has been contributing to global development 
through sharing valuable experiences with other countries in 
using World Bank funds, said the ministry spokesman. 
  A "China migration report," finished by both sides in June 
1993, is "of great importance" for the World Bank to compile a 
comprehensive guidebook for migration, the World Bank was quoted 
as saying. 
  China has been one of the most successful countries in 
handling migration for project sites, the ministry said. 
  Another cooperative project between the world's largest 
financial organization and the largest developing economy 
includes a joint investigation of and research on China's 
economy. 
  Eight research projects completed in 1993 cover the 
reduction 
of industrial energy consumption, China's trade in the '90s, the 
fiscal ties between central and local governments and other 
topics. 
  Such research results may be consulted both regarding 
policies for China's reform and opening-up as well as for policy 
background in deciding the scale and orientation of future 
loans, said China's Finance Ministry. 
  The cooperation was also heightened by high level visits by 
the World Bank, said the ministry spokesman. WB President Lewis 
Preston's visit to China last May and his positive remarks about 
China should also be conducive to closer cooperation between the 
two sides, he said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 15 (XINHUA) -- The number of 
emigrants from Hong Kong to Western countries dropped by almost 
20 percent in 1993 in spite of a prediction of higher proportion 
of emigration as 1997 approaches. 
  According to government provisional figures, 54,000 local 
residents left Hong Kong for overseas last year, putting the 
emigration figure below 60,000 for the first time in more than 
four years. 
  "The largest factor in the drop was the relatively poor 
economies of the most popular destination countries," said 
Acting Deputy Secretary for Security Keith Kwok. 
  On the contrary, he added, "the Hong Kong economy is still 
developing and growing while some who have emigrated have found 
it difficult to find work abroad." 
  Statistics showed only 5,925 were able to emigrate to 
Australia from July 1992 to July 1993, down from 13,000 between 
July 1991 to July 1992. 
  There was also a decrease in the number of people emigrating 
to the United States: 13,142 in 1993 against 14,882 in 1992. 
  But emigration to Canada rose to 31,200 in 1993 from 29,900 
in 1992. 
  Over the past few years, Canada, the United States and 
Australia were regarded as the favorite destinations of 90 
percent of Hong Kong emigrants. Most of those leaving the 
territory were young professionals, 30 to 40 years old.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China's Stand on Hong Kong Has Been Declared </F>
to the World"] 
  [Text] Ma Yuzhen, the Chinese Ambassador to London, wrote 
a letter to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee [FAC] 
of the British House of Commons last week, clarifying the 
mistaken remarks that Hong Kong Governor Patten made at the 
committee's hearing regarding the Chinese Government's position. 
In absence of an agreement between China and Britain, Ma Yuzhen 
reiterated, the three-tier political framework of the Hong Kong 
British authorities, which include the Legislative Council 
[Legco], the two municipal councils, and the district boards, 
must all be disbanded on 30 June 1997. They will then be 
reorganized in light of the stipulations of the Basic Law and 
the decision of the National People's Congress [NPC]. 
  This solemn and just stand of the Chinese Government, which 
is well-known to the Hong Kong people, was expounded by the 
spokesman for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office on 27 December last year. When Patten returned to 
London, however, he said that the Chinese Government in the end 
would not disband the three-tier framework organized by the Hong 
Kong British authorities before 1997. He also said that, if the 
Chinese Government were to do so, it would have to "justify 
itself before the international media." For this reason, 
Ambassador Ma Yuzhen made the necessary clarifications to 
Britain. Moreover, Sir Cradock, former British ambassador to 
China and foreign affairs adviser to the prime minister, also 
wrote to the FAC earlier, in which he refuted Patten's 
accusation and urged that the matter be placed on record. 
  In his letter and recently published memoirs, Cradock time 
and again pointed out that the "constitutional reform" 
introduced by Patten could only be "limited and transient" and 
would "bring more losses than gains." Cradock had participated 
in the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's transitional issue and 
was told long ago: If the British side designs its own 
arrangements which do not converge with the Basic Law, there 
will be no political "through train" in 1997. It is certain 
that the Chinese side will disband the political framework 
arranged by the British side and reorganize it in light of the 
Basic Law. While refuting Patten, it is definite that Cradock 
was speaking in Britain's interests. He wanted to distinguish 
right from wrong, state the advantages and disadvantages, and 
urge the British rulers to examine their policies and reconsider 
the matter (though Cradock himself did not expect too much from 
that). The purpose of Ambassador Ma Yuzhen's letter is to 
clarify the Chinese Government's position, dispel 
misunderstandings, and explain in advance the measures to be 
adopted in 1997. As for the reckless course taken by the 
British hardliners, China will not cherish any illusion nor will 
it expect a change in the course of the British side. In light 
of the legal principle, China has stated that the three-tier 
councils will be disbanded in 1997, which reflects China's 
resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong. As the statement has 
been made known to the world, will it be necessary for China to 
"justify itself" to international media in the future? 
  Through the 17 rounds of talks, the "gazettal" and "tabling 
of Patten's constitutional reform to the Legco," and a series of 
other tricks, China and the majority of Hong Kong people have 
realized that the British side has no sincerity in the talks. 
Unless the British side withdraws the partial "constitutional 
reform package" that has been submitted to Legco, it will be 
impossible for the Sino-British talks to resume. It is 
unnecessary for the Chinese side to cater to public opinion and 
urge the British side to return to the negotiating table. It 
would be irresponsible to raise the expectations of the Hong 
Kong people about the Sino-British talks. 
  The testimony at the hearing of the FAC had to acknowledge 
that Britain must hand Hong Kong over to China in 1997. Legco, 
the municipal councils, and the district boards are all 
components of the political framework of the Hong Kong British 
authorities, whose terms of office are stipulated in the "Royal 
Instructions." As the British administration of Hong Kong will 
end on 30 June 1997, the "Royal Instructions" and relevant laws 
will have to become void, as they contravene the "Basic Law," 
and the three-tier political framework will also have to be 
disbanded. In accordance with the provisions of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the Chinese 
Government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong on 1 July 1997 and will reorganize the political framework 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in light of the 
Basic Law and the NPC decision. 
  Based on convergence with the Basic Law, the Chinese 
Government actually wanted to cooperate with Britain through the 
talks and make transitional arrangements for the members of the 
three-tier councils. The Chinese side also made positive 
efforts in this regard. Such a wish fell through, however, 
because of the deliberate sabotage by the British side. In his 
speech delivered at the party to mark the Lunar New Year last 
week, Premier Li pointed out: "The responsibility for the 
termination of the Sino-British talks lies with the British 
side." In his letter to the FAC, Ambassador Ma Yuzhen described 
in detail how the talks were terminated. Ma introduced the 
concessions made by the Chinese side and how the British side 
complicated the issue and unilaterally declared a termination 
when an agreement was about to be reached at the 17th round of 
talks, which was followed by the tabling of the partial 
constitutional reform package at Legco. If Patten's partial 
constitutional reform package is adopted by the Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong British authorities in late February in 
the absence of a Sino-British agreement, it will be tantamount 
to voting for the disbanding of the three-tier organizations in 
1997.

  [Text] Macao, February 10 (XINHUA) -- The new Macao-Taipa 
bridge went into operation here today. 
  Macao Governor General Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira presided 
over a ceremony marking the opening of the bridge. 
  The governor first expressed his congratulations on the 
completion of the new bridge, saying he was convinced that the 
bridge would bring great benefits to local people. 
  The new bridge is expected to ease the tense traffic in 
Macao, the governor said. 
  He added that the opening of the bridge is a recognition of 
the great efforts that technicians and builders have made to 
finish the project. 
  It is learned that starting from today, all heavy-duty 
trucks 
will not be allowed to use the old Macao-Taipa bridge, finished 
in 1974. 
  The four-lane new bridge is 4,414 meters long and 19.3 
meters 
wide, with a total 1108.86-meter bridge approach at the two ends. 
  Construction of the bridge, started in 1990, costed more 
than 
600 million Macao patacas (about 77 million U.S. dollars).

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A heartening breakthrough"] </F>
  [Text] The news that negotiators from Taiwan and the 
Chinese mainland have reached agreement on several bones of 
contention is heartening indeed. 
  Chiao Jen-ho, secretary-general of Taiwan's Strait Exchange 
Foundation, and Tang Shubei, vice director of the mainland's 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, ended their 
five-day talks in Beijing on Saturday [5 February] with the 
issuance of a statement saying that agreement had been reached 
on ways to handle three controversial issues. 
  The three issues are the sending back of airplane hijackers, 
the returning of illegal immigrants, and fishing disputes. These 
topics were on the agendas of previous talks between the SEF and 
the ARAT'S but the two sides had been divided on how to deal 
with them. 
  The negotiators also agreed at the Beijing talks that an 
official pact will be signed after the exact wording of the pact 
is decided in the next round of talks later this year. All this 
can be seen as a breakthrough. Previous contacts between the SEF 
and the ARATS had all failed to yield any concrete results. 
  This is only the beginning. There is still a long way to go 
before a warm, brotherly relationship is established across the 
Taiwan Strait. But the breakthrough, however small, is better 
than nothing in view of the long, bitter confrontation between 
Taiwan and the mainland. 
  The main obstacle to better progress by SEF and ARATS 
negotiators is the sovereignty issue. While Beijing insists it 
has sovereignty over Taiwan, Taipei maintains that the mainland 
regime has no political or legal authority over the island. 
  This and other sharp political differences have prevented 
the 
SEF and the ARAT'S from settling a wide range of issues 
concerning relations between the two sides. 
  The impasse must be broken if a favorable situation is to be 
created for China's reunification -- the hope of all patriotic 
Chinese. 
  At the news conference he held last Friday, Premier Lien 
Chan 
noted the importance of working for reunification of the nation, 
and stressed that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should not 
treat each other in an eat-or-be-eaten manner. 
  He has a point. At a time when Chinese around the world are 
anxious for China's reunification, Taipei and Beijing should 
work aggressively to overcome all the barriers to the 
achievement of the goal. 
  Taiwan and the mainland, in negotiating for better ties, 
should put aside the sovereignty issue. If both sides treat each 
other with more trust, understanding, sympathy and respect, they 
will be better able to solve the many seemingly unsolvable 
problems troubling Taiwan-mainland interaction. 
  The sovereignty issue will probably sort itself out when 
eventually a reunification arrangement is worked out that is 
advantageous to both sides.

  [Text] Beijing, February 15 (XINHUA) -- Modern commercial 
mansions, name-brand boutiques and fast-food restaurants, most 
of which are backed by overseas funds, have cropped up in this 
capital of China. 
  Foreign businessmen who have plunged into Beijing's 
commercial market seem confident of their future. 
  A recent survey of 700 households in the city showed that 
over 11 percent of the people buy costly consumer goods. 
  Among Beijing's existing 375 joint ventures in commerce, 
Cvic 
[as received] Yaohan, a shopping center noted for its the 
largest amount of imported goods and open-shelf sales, has quite 
a few frequent customers, though prices there are three times 
higher than those on the same items in ordinary stores. 
  The center's general manager Hu Zhengjiang said the 
customers 
are mainly entrepreneurs and celebrities in the entertainment or 
sports circles. 
  According to Wang Yaozhang, an office director of the 
Friendship Shopping City in the Beijing Lufthansa Center, 60 
percent of its commodities and 90 percent of its imported 
commodities have gone to domestic buyers. 
  The shopping city, invested by German, South Korean and 
Chinese companies and operated by Chinese and Singapore 
managers, is the first joint venture in the field. It grossed 
670 million yuan in sales last year, ranking fourth in the 
city's commercial sector. 
  Over 50 food restaurants have been opened by foreign 
investors from more than 10 countries and regions, such as the 
U.S., Britain, France, Japan and Thailand. 
  The world's largest snack supplier, McDonald's Food Co. 
Ltd., 
opened its first branch on Wangfujing Street on April 23, 1992. 
It received 13,000 people that day, setting a new record in its 
history. 
  Strolling down the streets in Beijing, one may choose from 
Italian pizza, American Kentucky Fried Chicken, California beef 
noodles and hamburgers. 
  Beijingers have also become fashion-conscious. Name-brand 
clothing boutiques like theme, apple, crocodile and gold lion 
have attracted many shoppers. 
  French fashion designer Pierre Cardin has recorded handsome 
profits, despite its prohibitive prices for ordinary 
bread-winners, since the company took the lead in setting up a 
branch in the city. 
  The huge influx of foreign money is also an impetus to 
state-run enterprises in the sector. Many department stores, 
hotels and restaurants have improved their shop windows and 
services to compete for customers. 
  Last year, there were 187 joint ventures in Beijing, 
equalling the total for the previous 14 years. The promised 
investment reached 271 million U.S. dollars and retail sales 
topped 54.9 billion yuan.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696)] </F>
  [Text] Shijiazhuang, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- With the advent of 
the Spring Festival, Chen Junsheng, head of the State Council's 
Leading Group for the Economic Development of Impoverished 
Areas, visited an old revolutionary base in Hebei's Fuping 
county to extend his regards to local people and cadres, and to 
investigate and study the problems involving economic 
development in the impoverished mountainous district. He 
stressed: To enable a vast, poverty- stricken, mountainous 
area, particularly an old revolutionary area, shed poverty and 
achieve prosperity, we must carry forward the glorious tradition 
seen in the warring years of hard struggle and fearlessness in 
making sacrifices, mobilize the people, change our attitudes, 
recognize our superior position, lay down a sound foundation, 
pay attention to education, reduce childbirth and promote 
quality birth, and continually try to achieve new economic 
construction success. 
  From 1 to 3 February, State Councillor Chen Junsheng and his 
party visited Fuping County -- which in the past served for a 
long time as the headquarters of the party, the government, and 
the military in overseeing the border in Hebei Province -- to 
call on extremely poor households and relatives of the Red Army, 
and investigate work toward supporting impoverished areas in the 
county. He affirmed the achievements and efforts made by local 
people to banish poverty and attain prosperity. He said: The 
old revolutionary area made sacrifices in building the new 
China, and performed much meritorious service. While we 
currently face the arduous task of transforming our landscape 
and extricating ourselves from poverty, we must make further 
contributions with the spirit of self-reliance, building 
enterprises through big efforts and hard work. This applies to 
the old revolutionary area as well as to an extensive tract of 
impoverished land across the country. 
  Touching on problems concerning cadres in poor mountainous 
area, Chen Junsheng stressed: A number of contingents of 
leading cadres in the county and rural areas who are united, 
progressive, and relatively stable constitute a guarantee that 
the backward-looking attitude of poverty-stricken mountainous 
areas will change. Only when the leading groups are stable and 
powerful can we earn the confidence and arouse the enthusiasm of 
the people, and only then can we concentrate on clearly 
discerning our superior position, correctly choosing our own 
path, formulating medium and long-term plans and earnestly 
implementing them so our economy moves forward steadily and 
systematically. Toward this end, various localities establish a 
realistic incentive mechanism to encourage cadres to steadfastly 
carry on the frontline work of supporting development of poor 
areas. 
  Referring to efforts to improve basic production conditions 
in poor mountainous areas, Chen Junsheng said: Our country is 
intent on basically solving, by the end of the century, the 
problem of supplying food and clothing for more than 80 million 
poverty-stricken people. To do this, we will have to start with 
the most basic work of moving mountains, changing the course of 
rivers, and leveling the land. We must be determined to sweat 
it out, to toil and moil to terrace the slopes of the land, and 
to try to achieve between half a mu and one mu of terraced land 
per person to become self-sufficient in grain and basic 
subsistence. It is highly important that poor, mountainous 
areas develop forestry, and plant forests in mountain districts. 
Strenuous efforts must be made to grow grass, plant trees, and 
change the ecological environment; and we must emphasize the 
development of an economic forest and convert barren mountains 
into green banks that will lead the people to prosperity. 
  Economic development of mountainous areas is inseparable 
from 
village and township enterprises and the export of labor. Chen 
Junsheng said: To develop village and township enterprises we 
must not overreach ourselves and choose grandiose projects. We 
must proceed after considering local conditions and market 
needs, strive to make a success of every project we start, 
develop a representative product for each village and township, 
and establish our own superior features and key products. To 
develop village and township enterprises, we must mobilize the 
local labor force and integrate it with appropriate exports of 
labor. This will enable mountain people to improve their 
knowledge, change their attitudes, and become information 
transmitters, liaison personnel and salespeople. 
  Talking about departmental efforts to support the 
development 
of impoverished areas, he praised highly the drive by the 
Peoples' Liberation Army General Logistics Department, the 
Ministry of Agriculture, and the State Council's Government 
Offices Administration Bureau to mobilize cadres, staff members, 
and workers to donate large quantities of clothing and other 
everyday items to the old revolutionary area in Fuping County, 
saying that, to the people in the area, the efforts to provide 
timely help to the needy and poor were like offering them 
charcoal in snowy weather. He emphasized that, in addition to 
providing help with "hard items" such as cash and materials, 
various departments concerned must pay special attention to 
providing support with "soft items" to help people to prospect 
for and explore resources, design plans and systems for the 
training of cadres and qualified technical personnel, and to 
steadily enhance the cultural quality of workers in mountain 
districts. These represented the fundamental tasks which were 
crucial for generations to come. 
  Accompanying Chen Junsheng on the visit to Fuping County 
were 
Liu Jimin, deputy secretary general of the State Council; Yang 
Zhong, deputy head of the State Council's Leading Group for the 
Economic Development of Impoverished Area; and Li Yucai, member 
of a party organization under the Ministry of Forestry.

<F P=106> [By Correspondent Tian Guo (3944 6665) and Reporter Wang </F>
Dongmei (3769 0392 2734): "Wang Qun, secretary of the Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, Urges Effective 
Investigation and Handling of Cases After Hearing the Regional 
Procuratorate's Anticorruption Work Report"] 
  [Text] Recently, the regional party committee and the 
regional people's congress standing committee respectively heard 
the work report of the regional procuratorate. After hearing 
the report, Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee 
and chairman of the regional people's congress standing 
committee, made important instructions. 
  Wang Qun said: Last year particularly after the launching of 
the anticorruption struggle, the procuratorial organs across the 
region concentrated energy to investigate and handle a number of 
major and appalling cases and made noticeable achievements. 
However, the current situation cannot catch up with the 
requirements of the party Central Committee and the expectations 
of the people. This year, the procuratorial organs should 
continuously regard the investigations and handling of the cases 
that take place at leading party and government organs, judicial 
departments, administrative and law enforcement departments, and 
economic management departments as their duty-bound political 
task; conscientiously and effectively attend to it; and 
unswervingly deal blows to serious economic criminal activities, 
including corruption and bribery cases. We should give priority 
to and attach primary importance to investigating and handling 
the major and appalling cases that can produce great impacts and 
big damages. 
  He stressed: All localities should proceed from reality, sum 
up the experiences in investigating and handling cases, 
strengthen the extent of attack, and thoroughly investigate the 
cases no matter who involves. It is necessary to make a key 
breakthrough in investigating major cases and to rapidly attack 
the cases that have accurately been investigated. We should 
ensure not to have the cases half-handled lest forfeit the 
chance for combat should be forfeited. The anticorruption 
struggle is extremely complicated. Those criminal offenders have 
tried every possible means to avoid being attacked and adopted 
various countermeasures against us. The procuratorial organs 
should bravely carry forward the spirit of marching forward 
despite hardship, weariness, and risks and deeply and constantly 
wage the struggle against corruption. 
  In regard to the issue of strictly enforcing laws, he said: 
Chief Procurator Zhang Siqing mentioned that at present, a tiny 
number of localities and department leaders still have confused 
understanding about the relationship between anticorruption and 
the economic work and there still exist the phenomena of 
replacing laws by words, using power to repress laws, practicing 
local protectionism, and lacking the courage to face 
difficulties. These problems warrant our attention. We should 
firmly attend to the law enforcement work and attach importance 
to grasping and publicly handling the cases of administrative 
and law enforcement organs and financial departments not 
strictly enforcing laws and seriously violating discipline. In 
investigating and handling the major and appalling cases of this 
category, the procuratorial organs should pay attention to 
dissecting and analyzing the cases, draw inferences about other 
cases from one instance, and transfer the cases that offenders 
are not subject to criminal responsibilities to relevant 
departments for handling. If these problems are not solved, it 
will be difficult to create a new situation in waging the 
anticorruption struggle. 
  He urged that the leaders of the party committees at various 
levels should have a high degree of political responsibility, 
smash all ideological obstacles, eliminate all interference and 
obstructions, free themselves from the restrictions of personnel 
relations, and enthusiastically and effectively support the work 
of procuratorial organs in line with the principle of "being 
resolute first and prudent second and being sure to do 
accurately." Simultaneously, we should do our best to eliminate 
the procuratorial organs' economic difficulties in handling 
cases.

Standing Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regional 
Party Committee Hears Rural and Pastoral Work Report"] 
  [Text] On the arrival of the new year, the regional party 
committee standing committee held a meeting to hear the report 
on agriculture, animal husbandry, and the rural and pastoral 
work prepared by the autonomous regional leading group for rural 
and pastoral work. The meeting comprehensively analyzed the new 
situation and new tasks of the region's agriculture and animal 
husbandry and the rural and pastoral work; fully affirmed the 
achievements in agriculture, animal husbandry, and the rural and 
pastoral work; set forth the 1994 basic tasks and fighting 
targets; arranged the agricultural, livestock, and rural and 
pastoral work; and urged the whole party and all people of the 
region to be mobilized and make concerted efforts to create new 
agricultural and livestock production levels. Wang Qun, 
secretary of the regional party committee; and Wu Liji, Qian 
Fenyong, Bai Enpei, and Wang Zhan, deputy secretaries of the 
regional party committee, made important instructions at the 
meeting. 
  Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, pointed 
out: The cadres and the people across the region should define 
the thinking of welcoming the key year and creating a new 
situation; unswervingly implement the guidelines of the central 
rural work conference, the third plenary session of the 14th 
party Central Committee, and the eighth (enlarged) plenary 
session of the fifth regional party committee; strengthen the 
extent of reform; work out and also implement perfect measures; 
and create a new situation in agriculture, animal husbandry, and 
rural and pastoral work. We should make the rural and pastoral 
work suit the requirements for setting up the socialist market 
economic system; take the market as an orientation and economic 
results as the key; and develop high-yield, good-quality, and 
high-efficient agriculture and animal husbandry. We should 
bring into full play the might of "the primary productive 
forces" and create conditions for science professionals and 
technicians to build agriculture-science-education integrated 
bases in rural and pastoral areas. It is necessary to quicken 
the development of the secondary and tertiary industries and 
promote the pace of becoming fairly well-off. It is necessary 
to continuously implement the measures for reducing peasants and 
herdsmen's burden, safeguard their interests, and mobilize their 
enthusiasm. It is necessary to further support the poor. We 
should adopt special measures to support the peasants and 
herdsmen in the especially poverty-stricken areas and to help 
them eliminate their difficulties. The party committees and 
governments at various levels should strengthen the leadership 
over agriculture, animal husbandry, and the rural and pastoral 
work. All trades and professions and all departments should 
work out perfect measures to support the development of 
agriculture and animal husbandry. All levels should organize 
cadres and send them deep to the forefront of agricultural and 
livestock production, to grasp typical cases, and to conduct 
investigations and study. The leading cadres should adopt the 
forms of handling affairs on the spot to help the grass roots 
and the masses tide over difficulties. We should mobilize the 
forces of the whole party and the whole society and make 
concerted efforts to elevate agriculture, animal husbandry, and 
rural and pastoral work to a new high. 
  In line with the principle of stabilizing agriculture and 
animal husbandry and increasing the income of the peasants and 
the herdsmen and the spirit of "trying every possible means to 
be fast and do more," the meeting defined the 1994 fighting 
targets as follows: We should ensure to turn out 20 billion jin 
of grain and strive to reach 23 billion jin, ensure to produce 
56.6 million head of animals and strive to reach 57 million 
head, ensure to afforest on 5 million mu of land and strive to 
afforest on 5.5 million mu of land, and ensure that the output 
value of town and township enterprises should reach 28 billion 
yuan and strive to have their output value surpass 30 billion 
yuan. The per capita net income of the peasants and the 
herdsmen should increase 100 yuan over 1993. To ensure the 
realization of these targets, we should deepen reform, stabilize 
policies, and strengthen the construction of grass-roots 
organizations, and achieve success in strengthening the 
construction of the agricultural and livestock infrastructural 
facilities, readjusting the economic structures of rural and 
pastoral areas, quickening the development of town and township 
enterprises, and perfecting the socialized service system.

  [Text] Yantai, February 14 (CNS) -- The Jiaodong 
Peninsula, a major production base for gold, boasts abundant 
resources of this precious metal, with fruitful results from 
state level scientific research on gold after four years' 
efforts passed inspection by the Ministry of Geology and Mineral 
Resources. 
  This scientific research was sponsored by the State Science 
and Technology Commission and by the ministry while the Shandong 
prospecting institute undertook the item. 
  Researchers used data processing and research methods to 
create models for the prospecting of minerals involving 
geophysics, geology and geochemistry based on earlier 
information in these fields. Different indicators were set for 
the various models. 
  Sophisticated technology was introduced into the prospecting 
of gold mines in the region. The process of forming minerals 
was projected in four areas within the 7,800 sq.-kilometre 
Jiaodong Peninsula, leading to the discovery of 26 potential 
mineral resources, five of them of great significance. 
  Experts in gold prospecting were convinced that the 
technology involved in research into gold prospecting was 
totally practical and played a leading role in such endeavours. 
Such techniques for the location of gold received awards from 
the ministry for their excellence and application in 
exploitation of gold mines which will be very promising in the 
future. 
  The gold industry has become a pillar business in some 
counties and cities in the peninsula with gold production there 
having an important share in this field in the country as a 
whole.

  [Excerpts] The Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee met 
in Lhasa today to convey the guidelines laid down by the 
national conference on propaganda and ideological work. 
Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the regional party 
committee and chairman of the regional people's government, made 
an important speech at the meeting. 
  He stressed: Party committees at all levels in Tibet must 
fully understand the great significance of the national 
conference on propaganda and ideological work, and earnestly 
study the guidelines laid down in the important speeches made by 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji, and Propaganda Department Head Ding Guanggen at the 
conference. We must properly study, comprehend, and implement 
these guidelines, and then push Tibet's propaganda and 
ideological work to a higher level. [passage omitted] 
  Gycaincain Norbu's speech has these four parts: 1) We must 
carry out all major assignments set for propaganda and 
ideological work, firmly adhering to the basic principles for 
party work. 2) We must have a clear idea of the situation at 
home and abroad and seize the opportunity to accelerate Tibet's 
reform and development. 3) We must consider it our 
responsibility to maintain social stability and persist in 
carrying out all reform projects. 4) Party committees and 
governments at all levels must provide stronger leadership over 
propaganda and ideological work. [passage omitted] 
  Gycaincain Norbu stressed: Party committees and governments 
at all levels must attach importance to and support propaganda 
and ideological work, provide cadres engaged in propaganda and 
ideological work with the necessary working conditions, and help 
them solve their practical problems. We should not begrudge 
spending some money on propaganda and ideological projects. We 
must gradually improve the working conditions for the propaganda 
front, even if it means that we have to economize in other 
areas. We must strive to correct the current problems on the 
propaganda front -- problems such as shortage of personnel, poor 
quality of workers, simple and crude working conditions, and 
outmoded measures -- so that there will be noticeable 
improvements and propaganda and ideological work can become more 
effective. 
  The meeting was chaired by Denzim, deputy secretary of the 
regional party committee. Chan Hanchang, member of the regional 
party committee standing committee and head of the propaganda 
department of the regional party committee, conveyed the 
guidelines of the national conference on propaganda and 
ideological work. He also elaborated on the guidelines laid 
down by Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding Guangen in 
the important speeches they made at the national conference 
propaganda and ideological work. [passage omitted] 
  Attending the meeting were regional party committee leaders 
Hu Yongzhu, Zi Cheng, Lieque, and Lu Huimin; as well as party 
member-cadres of the regional people's congress, the regional 
government, the regional committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, the Tibet Military District, 
and the regional armed police forces; persons in charge of 
various regional units; party member-cadres of county and 
high-level propaganda departments; and persons in charge of

  On behalf of the regional party committee and the regional 
government, Danzim, deputy secretary of the regional party 
committee, spoke at the tea party. 
  Deputy Secretary Danzim said: Guided by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the guidelines laid down by the 14th 
national party congress and the fourth enlarged plenary session 
of the Fourth Tibet Regional Party Committee, Tibet achieved 
noticeable successes in 1993 in deepening reform and opening up 
wider to the outside world, as well as in building a socialist 
market economic system and speeding up the national economic 
development. In 1993, Tibet's GNP reached 3.65 billion yuan, 
topping that of the preceding year by 8.1 percent; the economy 
in agricultural and pastoral areas continued to develop 
steadily; and the gross agricultural output topped that of 1992 
by 5.3 percent, reaching 2.28 billion yuan. In 1993 the region 
had a bumper agricultural harvest for the sixth year in a row 
with total grain output reaching 620,000 tonnes, which was a 3.3 
percent increase over that a year ago. In animal husbandry, 
Tibet was able to maintain the main targets set for 1992. 
Township and town enterprises and other economic undertakings 
developed quite fast. The per capita income of peasants and 
herdsmen was about 515 yuan, or an increase of 5.1 percent over 
that of 1992. Industrial and communications enterprises had 
noticeably higher returns. Foreign trade and tourism maintained 
the good developmental momentum. New progress was achieved in 
bringing in outside resources and establishing ties with other 
parts of the country. The urban and rural markets became even 
more prosperous. All social services developed quite rapidly. 
New victories were won in the struggle against splittism. In 
1993, Tibet's economy continued to develop, its political 
situation was more stable, people of various nationalities are 
more united, and new progress was achieved in all fields. The 
situation was good as a whole. [passage omitted] 
  At the tea party, Lhamin Soinam Lhunzhub, vice chairman of 
the regional CPPCC committee, spoke on bahelf of the regional 
CPPCC committee. [passage omitted]

propaganda personnel who work in an area 4,500 meters above sea 
level all year round. 
  On the morning of 8 February, Director Chen joyfully got 
together with personnel of the Nagqu prefectural party committee 
Propaganda Department. He extended New Year and Spring Festival 
greetings to them on behalf of the regional party committee and 
its Propaganda Department. [passage omitted] 
  Chen Hanchang said: The situation on the nation's propaganda 
front has entered another high tide since the founding of the 
PRC. We must remain sober-headed and maintain a sense of trials 
and tribulations [you huan yi shi]. Although China has broken 
the Western economic blockade and sanctions, Western countries 
have stepped up activities to Westernize and divide us. In our 
region, the struggle against separatism will continue to be a 
long-term task. We must act in line with the central 
authorities' demands, step up propaganda and ideological work, 
and educate and train well our next generation to turn it into a 
new generation of qualified personnel who will span this and 
next century. 
  Director Chen said: Along with the deepening of reform and 
opening up, China's economy has entered a phase of vigorous 
development. While recognizing the current excellent situation, 
we must also realize where the region lacks. After the 
promulgation of the region's economic reform measures, we must 
subordinate ourselves to and serve the needs of the region's 
overall interests. The responsibility of the propaganda 
departments will hence become even heavier. We must immerse 
ourselves in the grass roots to do a good job of propaganda and 
guidance to ensure smooth implementation of reform measures. 
  Director Chen urged propaganda personnel to learn to pluck 
up 
their spirits constantly and work in a down-to-earth manner and 
with a stronger faith to score new success and raise propaganda 
and ideological work to a higher level in the New Year. [passage

<F P=106> [By XIZANG RIBAO reporters Wang Xubin (3769 4872 1755) and </F>
Zheng Weifu (6774 4850 1381): "Regional Economic Restructuring 
Work Conference Calls For Striving To Establish a New Socialist 
Market Economic Structure"] 
  [Excerpts] The three-day regional economic restructuring 
work conference ended on 22 January. 
  Ciren Zhuoga, vice chairman of the regional government, made 
a speech: "Earnestly Implement the Conference Guidelines, Work 
Hard To Establish a New Economic System." Xiao Huaiyuan, 
director of the regional economic research center, chaired the 
closing session, during which Zhang Zijian, deputy director of 
the regional finance department, explained the progress in 
appraising the fixed assets and circulating funds of enterprises 
in the region. 
  The main achievements of the conference are: First, 
increasing the awareness. After diligently studying Executive 
Vice Chairman Yang Chuantang's important speech and other 
relevant documents, the conferees renewed, deepened, and 
increased their awareness of the necessity of accelerating the 
pace of reforms and the urgency of strengthening the intensity 
of reform. At present, along with the continual deepening of 
reforms and growth of the economy, deep- rooted contradictions 
in the regional economic system have gradually surfaced. To 
solve these contradictions and problems, reform is the only way 
out and regression will absolutely lead us nowhere. Second, 
grasping the policy. Through study, discussion, and exchange of 
views, the conferees understood comprehensively the ideology for 
guiding reform in the region, which calls for "overall promotion 
and breakthrough in key areas" and for "converging with the 
whole nation in terms of framework and system." Third, 
clarifying the tasks. The conferees clearly defined the "three 
key areas and six major tasks" of reform for this year. Fourth, 
enhancing the confidence. Officials from all comprehensive 
economic departments and departments in charge of enterprises 
pledged to transform functions, delegate authority to 
enterprises, and eliminate red tape for them in accordance with 
the principle of separating government administration from 
enterprise management so as to give rein to enterprises to 
develop themselves. For their part, representatives from 
enterprises said specific and preferential reform measures, 
which have proved effective for improving the external 
environment of enterprises and invigorating their internal 
vitality, will definitely promote the comprehensive growth of 
enterprises. 
  Vice Chairman Ciren Zhuoga put forward a five-point 
requirement for implementing the conference guidelines: First, 
it is necessary to earnestly study, comprehend, and transmit the 
conference guideline. [passage omitted] 
  Second, it is necessary to ensure good groundwork for 
establishing a modern enterprise system, which is a key area of 
the enterprise reform in 1994. [passage omitted] 
  Third, while promoting overall and supplementary reforms, 
all 
prefectures (cities) and counties must never neglect reforms in 
farming and pastoral areas. [passage omitted] 
  Fourth, the regional and prefectural (city) economic 
restructuring departments should work hard to organize and 
coordinate the implementation of various reform measures slated 
for this year. [passage omitted] Fifth, it is necessary to 
relentlessly carry out reform measures. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Cheng Xiaohong (4453 2556 4767): "Tibet Will Soon </F>
Undergo Finance and Tax Reform"] 
  [Text] This reporter has learned from a recent regional 
conference on finance and taxation work that the region will 
soon institute a finance and tax system reform plan. The plan 
is based on Tibet's reality and follows the principle of 
carrying out the reform actively, prudently, slowly, orderly, 
appropriately, flexibly, and in an all-around way. The plan 
conforms with the basic national guidelines while taking into 
consideration Tibet's particular situation. 
  The finance and tax system reform consists mainly of a new 
tax system, a finance management system under the separated 
taxation system, and an enterprise profits distribution system. 
  While not deviating from the basic framework of the national 
tax reform, the region's tax system reform has made appropriate 
adaptations in light of Tibet's particular conditions. 
Specifically, the region will be somewhat different from the 
rest of the country in the range of incomes subject to different 
categories of taxation and in tax deferment, retention and 
abrogation of tax categories, the amount of expense deduction, 
applicable tax rates, and tax reduction and exemption. The 
number of tax categories is cut by half from 18 to nine, 
reflecting the characteristics of minority regions [ti xian le 
min zu qu yu de te dian]. Although the plan envisions an 
increase in taxation targets, it will retain the original 
preferential policies enjoyed by the region, thereby helping 
keep the total amount of taxes to be collected from increasing. 
As a result, the plan enables the masses of peasants and 
herdsmen to maintain their vested interests without adding even 
one cent of their tax burden. 
  Regarding the finance management system under the separated 
taxation system, the region has formulated policies related to 
management at different levels. The principal guidelines are: 
The autonomous region and its prefectures and cities will each 
have well-defined revenues and expenditures based on their 
jurisdiction over administrative and financial matters; revenues 
from newly established tax categories will be divided among the 
autonomous region, prefectures or cities, and counties at a 
specific ratio; and the financial resources will be 
redistributed rationally between different areas. The 
formulated policies also contain provisions concerning the 
linkage between the past "contracted financial responsibility" 
system and the finance management system under the separated 
taxation system. 
  Regarding the enterprise profits distribution system, the 
region will implement in an all-around way a reform package to 
separate taxes from profits among state-owned enterprises this 
year. Under the new system, revenues will be taxed at a 
proportional rate of 30 percent and the regulatory tax and 
energy and communications surcharges will be eliminated. With 
the exception of a few enterprises which generated huge profits, 
the overwhelming majority of the region's enterprises will be 
able to retain all their profits in the short run for use by 
themselves in accordance with the relevant regulations of the 
finance departments. Financial responsibility contracts signed 
with enterprises will remain valid until they mature.

<F P=106> [By station reporter Ren Youming: "Private Businesses </F>
Develop Rapidly in Tibet; from the "Great 1993 Review" feature 
of the "News" program] 
  [Text] Last year, earnestly following the instructions 
which Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave in his southern China talks, 
and proceeding from Tibet's actual situation, Tibetan industrial 
and commercial authorities gave independent and private 
businesses the great support they needed for development by 
drawing up the necessary preferential measures and simplifying 
registration formalities. Consequently, the development of 
private business made substantial headway. In 1993, 2,500 new 
independent business operators and over 40 private enterprises 
with registered capital of more than 13 million yuan were set up 
in Tibet, topping those of 1992 by 2.2 times and 2.3 times, 
respectively. 
  The development of independent and private businesses used 
to 
be quite slow in Tibet, primarily because of relevant 
authorities' excessive controls. Last year, industrial and 
commercial authorities in Tibet gave top priority [fang zai shou 
wei] to the development of independent and private businesses. 
Making continual efforts to emancipate their minds, change 
their mindset, and free themselves from worries, they drew up 
preferential policies and measures for supporting the 
development of independent and private businesses. 
  These policies include simplifying registration and 
licensing 
formalities. Anyone can apply for an operating license as long 
as he has an ID card and a letter of recommendation from 
relevant authorities; and all applications are immediately 
processed without delay. Meanwhile, the scope of operations was 
also broadened. Local independent operators as well as those 
from other parts of the country were allowed to engage in 
wholesale or retail trading of whatever commodities the state 
had decontrolled. Surplus personnel which government organs, 
enterprises, and institutions were to replace were permitted to 
take up second vocations. Peasants and herdsmen were allowed to 
trade their agricultural, sideline, and livestock products in 
cities without paying management charges or business taxes. 
Local and nonlocal independent operators were encouraged to 
provide long-distance delivery services. Meanwhile, other 
relevant departments also changed their old ways of doing things 
by abolishing irrational levies and providing services which 
independent and private businesses needed for their development. 
  These improvements and effective measures have expedited the 
rapid development of independent and private businesses in 
Tibet. Last year, Tibet's independent and private businesses 
paid more than 20,000 yuan in taxes to the state.

<F P=106> [Article by Zheng Weifu (6774 4580 1381): "Trade Fairs </F>
Develop Rapidly in Urban, Rural Tibet"] 
  [Text] Tibet made significant progress in the 
administration of industry and commerce last year. 
  Since the beginning of 1993, industry and commerce 
administrative departments at various levels have stepped up 
efforts to construct infrastructural hard facilities for 
markets, actively nurturing and perfecting markets and 
strengthening market supervision. Last year, the region spent a 
total of 11.62 million yuan to build, in a systematic and 
planner manner, 23 markets of various kinds, covering 32,788 
square meters of ground space. As of the end of December, there 
were 99 markets with a total of over 100,000 square meters of 
ground space in Tibet. They have, to a certain extent, improved 
the appearance of narrow streets crowded with open-air stalls 
and peddlers. Last year, transactions from urban and rural 
trade fairs totaled more than 900 million yuan, representing a 
21.6 percent increase over 1992 and accounting for 47.36 percent 
of the total volume of the region's retailed sales. Lhasa's 
Chongsaikang Comprehensive Market, the largest market in Tibet, 
set a record 300 million yuan in transactions. 
  Along with improved infrastructural facilities for markets, 
the variety and structure of markets have gradually developed 
from trade fairs and specialized markets to capital goods and 
comprehensive markets. Street stalls and peddlers now have 
permanent operational sites and facilities; and markets, which 
used to be run by individual traders, are now owned by the 
state, collective, private, and individual sectors of the 
economy. An open and comprehensive new system of market 
networks with local characteristics has taken shape. 
  Last year, the industry and commerce administrative 
departments also actively introduced an enterprise registration 
system in a bid to help state enterprises change their operating 
mechanisms and promote their healthy development. The 
establishment of a legal independent registration system was a 
major breakthrough achieved by the administration for industry 
and commerce. As of the end of December, 3,485 state and 
collective enterprises had completed registration with a total 
of 3,944,020 yuan [figure as published] in registered capital. 
Of these, 855 enterprises with 829,540 yuan [figure as 
published] in registered capital completed registration in 1993, 
up 31.3 percent and 26.6 percent, respectively, over 1992. The 
number of foreign-funded enterprises increased from six in 1992 
to 27, with a total registered capital of $24.75 million; and 
129 foreign firms were approved to set up offices in Tibet, an 
increase of 370 percent over 1992. Last year, Tibet accepted 20 
applications for trademark registration and approved the 
registration of five trademarks. So far, there are nine 
registered trademarks in Tibet. More than 260,000 advertisements 
were published, and their total business volume exceeded 1 
million yuan for the first time, reaching 1.13 million yuan. 
  Last year the individual sector of the economy expanded 
steadily while private-owned enterprises multiplied. As of the 
end of December, there were 41,830 industrial and commercial 
units run by individuals; and the number was basically the same 
as the preceding year. They employed 65,579 people and had a 
total of 174.46 million yuan in registered capital, up 73.9 
percent and 71.64 percent, respectively, over 1992. There were 
60 registered privately-owned enterprises and their registered 
capital was 13.31 million yuan, representing a 330 percent and 
230 percent increase, respectively, over 1992 and showing a 
strong momentum of continued fast growth. Revenues from 
industrial and commercial units run by individuals in Tibet last 
year are expected to reach 26 million yuan.

"Success Stories from the Economic Front -- Our Region Makes 
Great Strides in Bringing in Funds From Abroad and Developing 
Lateral Ties at Home"] 
  [Text] In carrying out economic work, the people of Tibet 
have further emancipated their minds and opened up to the 
outside world. Last year, they made great strides in attracting 
funds from abroad and developing lateral ties at home. 
  Last year, our region formally approved 41 projects to 
attract funds from abroad and develop lateral ties at home, 
reaching agreements on bringing in more than 100 million yuan. 
The funds brought in by those projects were intended for 
Tibet's communications and transportation sector, light 
industry, textiles, machinery and electronics, and commercial 
sector. 
  Tibet, known as "the roof of the world," is a virgin land 
that waits to be developed. As the policy of reform and opening 
up has deepened constantly, the high plateau has thrown its 
doors open and attracted the attention of people at home and 
abroad. To accelerate reform and opening up, actively attract 
foreign and domestic capital, and promote rapid economic 
development, in 1992 the autonomous regional people's government 
formulated "Several Provisions on Encouraging Domestic and 
Foreign Investment in Tibet," as well as the "Interim Measures 
for Rewarding People Who Are Instrumental in Bringing in 
Domestic and Foreign Investment Into Tibet." Moreover, it set 
up an office in charge of concrete work under the autonomous 
regional economic coordination committee for introducing funds 
from abroad and developing lateral ties at home. In the past 
year, Tibet has begun to show good progress in attracting funds 
from abroad and developing lateral ties at home. Hong Kong's 
Shiheng Group began investing in our region in 1992, the year in 
which Tibet took initial steps toward bringing in funds and 
developing lateral ties. Together with the Lhasa City 
Electrical Power Bureau and the tourist company affiliated with 
the autonomous regional physical culture committee, it developed 
the Hongjingtian series of products for use on highlands, as 
well as mineral water. This marked the beginning of Tibet's 
efforts to introduce funds from abroad and develop lateral ties 
at home. Shortly afterward, businessmen from other countries 
and regions, such as the United States, Japan, Germany, Nepal, 
and Malaysia, came to the plateau to negotiate business 
ventures. The autonomous regional economic coordination 
committee for introducing funds from abroad and developing 
lateral ties at home launched 49 projects to attract investment. 
Last June, Atewufei [transliteration of name as received] 
Company from the United States invested 9.5 million yuan to set 
up Tibet Yak Meat Products Limited Company in conjunction with 
the autonomous regional association of self-employed laborers. 
Preparations for this business venture are now under way. 
Nepalese businessmen invested 7.5 million yuan to set up Tibet 
Carpet Limited Company with the Chengguan District Ethnic 
Handicrafts Administration in Lhasa City. Construction of the 
factory premises is near completion. Hong Kong's Dadi Real 
Estate Development Company, and Liyuan Scientific and 
Technological Development Company under the autonomous regional 
economic research center jointly set up the Tibet-Hong Kong 
Yishou Products Limited Company to produce a series of health 
care products, the mass-production of which has commenced. Last 
year also saw the establishment of Tibet Qomolangma Carpet 
Limited Company, Tibet Kawajian Carpet and Woolen Handicrafts 
Limited Company, and Tibet Zhihui Cultural Development Limited 
Company. A number of enterprises from other parts of the 
country also set up companies in Tibet. China Ferrous Metals 
Corporation and Chengdu Qiaofeng Modern Office Equipment Company 
also invested in Tibet and achieved notable economic results. 
  The policy of attracting funds from abroad and developing 
lateral ties at home has somewhat alleviated the shortage of 
investment funds in some of Tibet's industries, has brought in 
technology and information, injected vitality into our region's 
market economic development, and promoted economic construction. 
It has been reported that although Tibet is making rapid 
progress in introducing funds from abroad and developing lateral 
ties at home, most of the projects involve short periods between 
technology development and application, are of medium 
technological levels, and yield speedy economic results. 
Medium- and long-term investment projects are relatively rare. 
However, it is believed that as Tibet accelerates its pace of 
reform and opening up, it will become a much-sought-after 
destination for domestic and foreign investors. It will not be 
long before Tibet develops and utilizes its abundant resources.

<F P=106> [By reporters Li Zhiyong (2621 1807 0516) and Miao Fanzu </F>
(0416 5379 0586)] 
  [Text] Lhasa, 7 Feb (XINHUA) -- Surrounded by the highest 
mountains in the world, Tibet opens up itself to greet changes 
brought about by the market economy. Over the past year, 
Tibet's gross regional product reached 3.65 billion yuan, up 8.1 
percent over last year and exceeding the average growth rates 
over the past 10 years. Financial incomes of localities totaled 
149 million yuan, up 37 percent over last year. 
  Opening up has helped steer vast farms and stock raising 
farms in Tibet toward the broad market. Peasants and herdsman 
of tens of thousands of households were organized by market 
forces. In the past, the state planned allocation and transfer 
of grains in southern Tibet to the northern part and cows and 
sheep in northern Tibet to the south. Now there are 
professional transporters, sellers, and agents who activate 
exchanges of agricultural and animal husbandry products between 
northern and southern Tibet. If we call the returning of 
livestock, land, and pasture to peasant households the first 
push to the farming and animal husbandry production in Tibet 
since the reform and opening up, then, the further 
commercialization of farming and animal husbandry products will 
provide a greater motive force to encourage farmers and herdsman 
to develop production. Last year is Tibet's sixth of 
consecutive harvests of farm produce. Compared to the previous 
year, livestock production also increased. Total agricultural 
output increased 5.3 percent over the previous year. 
  Opening up has also brought opportunity and vitality to 
Tibet's industries. By conscientiously carrying out the 
"Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in 
State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" and seriously changing 
operating mechanisms, enterprises in the entire region have 
fulfilled various economic targets and reduced their deficits. 
The transportation sector, a sector vital to Tibet's economy, 
had been enduring competition and challenges from all sides. 
Last year, the autonomous region decided to lift all 
restrictions on transportation enterprises in a bid to steer 
them into markets. Under this situation, not one of the 20-odd 
state-owned transportation enterprises under the Communications 
Department collapsed. On the contrary, they made up deficits 
and increased surpluses by a large margin. Even the Gerermu 
Transportation Corporation, the only enterprise that operated at 
a loss, eliminated losses by more than 200 million yuan. 
  Opening up has brought a great number of businessmen into 
Tibet from the interior of the country, given an impetus to 
arousing local people's awareness of commodity, and helped 
Tibet's tertiary industry grow rapidly. Opening up has enabled 
Tibet, a place used to be backward in foreign trade, to 
transform itself into a front of China's foreign trade. Opening 
up has made tourism a pillar industry in Tibet, enabled more 
people to see Tibet's unique strong points in resources, and 
attracted many foreign businessmen. Although the investment 
environment was not very good, 27 foreign-funded enterprises 
were opened here last year and economic exchanges and 
cooperation with the interior were conducted more frequently. 
The very effective policy of importing from abroad and 
cooperating with units in the interior quickened the process of 
transforming Tibet's strong points in resources to economic ones. 
  Opening up is exerting more and more influence over the 
consciousness and concepts of people in Tibet. They realize 
that no matter how unique Tibet is, they cannot only depend on 
long-term "blood transfusion" nor on maintaining planned or 
semiplanned economic structures to get rid of backwardness. 
They can only integrate Tibet's market into the vast nationwide 
market and double efforts to get rid of backwardness. 
Autonomous Regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu emphatically said: 
"In reform and opening up, Tibet must make efforts to develop 
in pace and forge a direct link with the nationwide market."

  [Text] In 1993 the province maintained a vigorous 
development trend in border trade. According to statistics from 
the provincial Border Trade Bureau, last year Yunnan registered 
a total of 2.873 billion yuan in imports and exports through 
border trade, an increase of 26.55 percent over the previous 
year. Last year border trade departments focused their work on 
adjusting the product mix. The imports and exports of bulk 
commodities through border trade developed well. Of commodities 
imported through border trade, 28 categories each exceeded 1 
million yuan, while 16 categories of exported commodities each 
exceeded 10 million yuan, including cigarettes, electrical 
machinery, building materials, and textile products. The 
quality of commodities imported and exported through border 
trade improved as a result of cooperation between the relevant 
management and supervisory departments on both sides. 
  In addition, eight border prefectures have scored marked 
achievements in carrying out economic and technological 
cooperation with Burma, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand. By the end 
of 1993 they had signed 46 contracts, worth a total of more than 
$100 million. So far contracts worth almost $50 million have 
been completed, 50 percent of the total amount of the province's 
economic and technological cooperation with foreign countries.

  [Text] Kunming, February 14 (CNS)--Some regions and 
departments in Yunnan Province have been burdened with public 
debts owed by individuals, the supervisory bodies in various 
prefectures and cities in the province have revealed. 
  Inspection by supervisory organs throughout Yunnan of 6,631 
entities and 391,970 persons since last June have found that a 
total of 1,854 entities had been discovered where public funds 
were owed by 17,938 individual cadres or workers including 
officials of local department level, county division level, 
township section level and general cadres and workers. The 
number of persons owing debts put at over RMB [renminbi] 5,000 
was 1,377, with the greatest debt put at RMB 560,000. Persons 
who had outstanding debts for longer than five yers numbered 
2,240 with the longest time for an outstanding debt was put at 
some 20 years. Public debts mainly occurring as the result of 
natural disasters or accidents or due to living difficulties 
were few and most of the debts were used to buy flats, fund the 
construction of a building, undertake economic activities or 
deposit public funds in personal accounts. 
  The Yunnan government recently asked various places to 
settle 
their own debt problems in cases where individuals had borrowed 
public funds or owed public debts under various kinds of guises. 
Inspection teams were set up by supervisory departments in a bid 
to ensure effective efforts to solve these problems.

  [Text] Postal and telecommunications departments in Yunnan 
have speeded up their construction, and this has brought about 
faster development in postal and telecommunications services. 
Last year the province registered its fastest postal and 
telecommunications development. Its total investment in fixed 
assets amounted to 530 million yuan, an increase of 61 percent 
over 1992. It completed a number of modern telecommunications 
projects, including program-controled telephone exchanges, 
digital microwave equipment, and optical-fiber 
telecommunications equipment, thus doubling its long-distance 
telecommunications capacity. It completed 140,000 telephone 
exchanges, an increase of 66 percent over the previous year; 
direct-dialing telephone calls were available in 91 cities 
throughout the province; 86 cities entered the nationwide 
long-distance direct-dialing telephone network; and 
international direct dialing was possible from 48 cities. The 
use of telephone equipment in the province increased by 32 
percent over the previous year. In the postal and 
telecommunications field, a mail-sorting center was built in 
Baoshan and a mail transfer station was built in Luxi. 
  Postal and telecommunications facilities have been either 
constructed or updated. This has promoted the development of 
postal and telecommunications services. Last year, postal and 
telecommunications business totaled 558 million yuan, 124.6 
percent of the annual plan, an increase of 55.6 percent over the 
previous year. In 1992 its growth rate ranked 17th in the 
country; last year it rose to 14th. The growth rate in the 
province's postal and telecommunications business outstripped 
the country's average.

"Cultural Traditions and the Concept of Human Rights"] 
  [Text] U.S. State Department once again issued a "report on 
human rights" on 1 February. Repeating the same old tune, it 
once again made irresponsible remarks about the human rights 
conditions in quite a few countries throughout the world and 
distorted, criticized, and attacked China's domestic situation. 
These allegations have been solemnly refuted by the relevant 
countries, and the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman has again 
clearly expressed our country's position of resolutely opposing 
taking human rights as an excuse to interfere in China's 
internal affairs. 
  With regard to the human rights issue, people may recall the 
remarks that Chairman Jiang Zemin made at his official meeting 
with U.S. President Clinton in Seattle last November. He said: 
There are nearly 1,000 nationalities and approximately 200 
nations on earth, with a great variety of cultural traditions 
and lifestyles, making the world rich and colorful. This fact 
is also reflected in human rights concepts. In the developed 
countries of Europe and the Americas and in the developing 
countries of the East, there are also differences in the concept 
of human rights owing to varying cultural traditions, ways of 
life, and stages of development. For example, over 2,000 years 
ago, China's ancient philosophers had the ideology of treasuring 
the people and cherishing universal love such as "the people are 
the foundation of an imperial ancestral temple," "it is a virtue 
to honor other aged people and look after other children as we 
do our own," and so on. China's socialist way of life has 
conditioned the extent, fairness, and sincerity of stressing 
human rights, which has been obtained by the Chinese people 
through hard struggle and sacrifice with bloodshed. When 
signboards saying "no admittance to Chinese and dogs" were hung 
on the gates of Chinese parks, what human rights did the Chinese 
people have? China is a developing country with a large 
population, and the right of development is an important right 
that has a bearing on the destiny and future of the Chinese 
nation. This is China's national situation, and the European 
and American countries have a different kind of national 
situations. Their cultural traditions cannot be traced to the 
same origin, not to mention their life-styles and stages of 
development. The concept on human rights in European and 
American countries primarily originated from the ideological 
trend of humanism formed in the European Renaissance Movement. 
At that time, the rising bourgeoisie regarded personal freedom 
and the pursuit of personal happiness as natural instincts of 
human beings, and took these as their theoretical bases to 
oppose religious prerogative, hierarchy, and feudal rule. No 
doubt, this ideological trend had tremendous, historic 
significance for pushing forward social progress and development 
at that time, but it also had notable historical limitations. 
Here, we might as well review some famous expositions by the 
founders of the theory on human rights in Europe. 
  First, the personal freedom and happiness that they pursued 
was, in essence, the right to possess property. The British 
political ideologist Locke, called by Marx and Engels as the 
"founding father" of bourgeois liberalism, maintained: In the 
"human rights endowed by nature," including life, freedom, 
property, and so on, which can neither be given away nor taken, 
property rights are the most fundamental of rights. His famous 
remark was: The grass that my horses graze and the soil that my 
servants plow are all my property. Property alone -- rather than 
blood lineage or the will of God -- is the symbol of rights. In 
fact, when Locke and other ideologists during the bourgeois 
revolution period flaunted the banner of the "natural right" to 
oppose religious prerogative and feudal autocracy, they "used 
the privilege of money to replace all personal and hereditary 
privileges of the past." When the U.S. Constitution--the first 
bourgeois constitution written in the world--was formulated in 
1787, possession of property and payment of taxes were taken as 
a prerequisite for obtaining the right to vote. Incidentally, in 
accordance with this constitution, American blacks and women 
were deprived of the right to vote for a long time due to their 
"natural" color and sex. As a matter of fact, it was not until 
the 1960's that universal suffrage was practiced in the United 
States, which was stipulated in the first constitution of New 
China. 
  Second, the European humanist concept of human rights 
acknowledges that "all men are born equal," but, in defining 
this right, it also acknowledges that, owing to the unequal 
strength of men, it is reasonable to swallow one another up. 
The most typical expression of this idea was made by Spinoza, 
the 17th century Dutch political ideologist, who said: "The 
greatest natural right of a big fish is to swallow little 
fishes." His theory of natural rights maintained that a man's 
right endowed by nature is identical with his natural 
aspirations and strength. In other words, the extent of a man's 
right is decided by the extent of his strength. He openly 
advocated the law of the jungle -- the weak are the prey of the 
strong. According to this theory, then, in the development 
process of old-style capitalist countries, their policies of 
colonial expansion, the slave trade, and gunboat diplomacy were 
undoubtedly logical. The Yuanming Garden was looted and burned 
by the Eight-Power Allied Forces, but China had to pay a large 
sum of money as "compensation!" Of course, this is now history, 
but hegemonism and power politics have far from disappeared from 
international life, as people can still discern from this, the 
shadow of the history of that period. 
  The humanist ideology of the European bourgeois 
revolutionary 
forerunners has made historical contributions. History has made 
giant advances for three centuries, and earth-shaking changes 
have taken place throughout the world. We should inherit their 
ideology critically -- not to mention the even more ancient and 
brilliant civilizations which can be compared and taken as a 
reference apart from the ideology that originated in Europe. 
Therefore, it is very natural that different countries and 
nations have identical or different stands and viewpoints on the 
issue of human rights. If they cannot reach a consensus for the 
moment, it is definitely possible to seek common ground while 
reserving differences. Under no circumstances, however, should 
a certain concept of human rights be imposed on others, still 
less should the issue of human rights be used to meddle in other 
countries' internal affairs, or to exert political pressure on 
them. Otherwise, they will not be able achieve their aim and, 
more often than not, the result will be opposite to the desired 
effect. As a Western saying goes: They will only shoot 
themselves in the foot.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by LIEN HO PAO Beijing special </F>
correspondent Yen Hsin-li (6056 2450 0448): "Xu Weicheng Calls 
For Guarding Against Peaceful Evolution by Hong Kong and Taiwan 
Businessmen"] 
  [Text] Even though the decisions to establish a market 
economy structure will be put into practice and the structural 
reform in five major systems will be carried out in Beijing this 
year, the ultra-leftist forces in the propaganda, theoretical, 
literary, and artistic circles remain powerful, and the rumor 
that "leftist prince" Xu Weicheng has fallen into disgrace and 
has been dismissed from the Propaganda Department of the CPC 
Central Committee has turned out to be false. Chen Zhili, an 
activist of the "Shanghai clique" and the former head of the 
Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, 
did not take up the post as director of RENMIN RIBAO, as the 
news spread among the people. The ultra-leftists still have 
considerable influence in the ideological field. 
  According to a source from Beijing's intellectual circles, 
Xu 
Weicheng, a trusted person in the Cultural Revolution and the 4 
June incident, still holds the position as executive deputy head 
of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee in 
charge of ideological and political work. In the Central 
Propaganda Department, except for the department head Ding 
Guangen (a member of the Politburo highly trusted by Deng 
Xiaoping), Xu Weicheng holds the highest position. Although 
Cheng Bijian, former political secretary of the late General 
Secretary Hu Yaobang, has been transferred to the Central 
Propaganda Department to take charge of theoretical and 
propaganda work, his actual position is lower than Xu Weicheng's 
because of the latter's seniority in the Central Propaganda 
Department. 
  Recently, Xu Weicheng made a speech at a national meeting to 
review experience of ideological and political work in 
enterprises. He criticized the view that "ideological work in 
enterprises is not indispensable," and expressed the necessity 
of strengthening the confidence of cadres in charge of political 
work in enterprises. 
  At present, CPC committees and branches are being set up in 
Hong Kong- and Taiwan-invested enterprises in various localities 
so that CPC committees are able to exercise control over the 
workers and staff members in foreign-invested enterprises. Xu 
Weicheng has participated in the activities of enterprise party 
committees to strengthen ideological and political work. He 
stressed the necessity of guarding against Hong Kong and Taiwan 
investors who may take advantage of investment to carry out 
"peaceful evolution." 
  A noted personality in Beijing's intellectual circles 
disclosed that Deng Liqun (the former head of the Propaganda 
Department and secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central 
Committee), a "leftist prince" who is more famous than Xu 
Weicheng, harbors "resistant sentiments" against the replacement 
of the planned economy by the market economy, and is privately 
writing articles of criticism on this subject. 
  In addition, the "leftist princes" in the literary and 
artistic circles -- including Lin Mohan, Liu Baiyu, Malqinhu, 
Zang Kejia, and so on -- who had murderous looks on their faces 
during the 4 June incident, also are controlling some 
ultra-leftist publications and are resisting in-depth economic 
structural reform by roundabout ways. 
  Personalities from Beijing's intellectual circles pointed 
out: Deng Xiaoping has always employed his "political left hand" 
and "economic right hand" simultaneously so as to exercise 
absolute control over the ideological field in order to prevent 
the recurrence of the Hu Qili and Zhu Houze error of stressing 
material progress at the expense of cultural and ideological 
progress. That is why he still installed Xu Weicheng and Wang 
Renzhi, former head of the Central Propaganda Department, in 
important positions. 
  Previously, Xu Weicheng, a trusted follower of Zhang 
Chunqiao, had been in charge of Shanghai's party newspaper 
JIEFANG RIBAO for a long time, and was transferred to be 
editor-in-chief of BEIJING RIBAO during the Cultural Revolution. 
At that time, he set up the "Model of Huang Shuai" who, 
"although a pupil, dared to scold her teachers," and became a 
pawn of Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao in Beijing's propaganda 
circles. Xu and a number of leftist princes still hold power in 
the CPC's propaganda, theoretical, cultural, and educational 
departments and their affiliated organizations, which signifies 
that the "leftist poison" on the mainland has not been 
eliminated.

<F P=106> ["At the Provincial Conference on Procuratorial and Judicial </F>
Work, Chen Huanyou Stresses That it is Necessary To Attach 
Importance to and Strengthen Procuratorial and Judicial Work in 
Order To Guarantee the Smooth Progress of Reform and 
Construction"] 
  [Text] The three-day provincial conference on 
procuratorial and judicial work, convened by the provincial 
party committee, ended in Nanjing on 26 January. Chen Huanyou, 
secretary of the provincial party committee and provincial 
governor, made an important speech at the conference. Cao 
Hongming, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and 
secretary of the Commission on Politics and Law under the 
provincial party committee, presided over the conference. 
  After fully affirming the work done by the procuratorial and 
judicial front in Jiangsu in 1993, Chen Huanyou said in his 
speech: To fulfill our province's objectives by the end of this 
century, we must have a stable social and political environment 
as our guarantee. Reform, opening up to the outside world, and 
economic development on the one hand and stability on the other 
form a unity, and they are mutually promoting each other. 
Without economic development, there will be no foundation for 
stability; at the same time, without a stable environment, we 
will not succeed in doing anything, for stability is the basic 
condition for reform and opening up to the outside world. This 
year is crucial for us to push forward the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure. In accordance with the 
unified plans of the party Central Committee, we will introduce 
a series of major reform measures. Party committees and 
governments at all levels must have a good understanding of 
this. They must not only seize the opportunities and accelerate 
development, but also stick to the principle of "grasping two 
links at the same time and attaching importance to both" and 
attach special importance to the safeguarding of social and 
political stability. Procuratorial and judicial departments at 
all levels, as the main force and the departments whose 
functions are to maintain social and political stability, must 
have a clear understanding of the situation and the heavy 
responsibility they are bearing. They should further enhance 
their sense of responsibility and their awareness of their 
mission, exercise their functions scrupulously, work hard, and 
continue to play a role in maintaining a social and political 
environment characterized by stability and unity. 
  Chen Huanyou pointed out: In carrying out their work in 
1994, procuratorial and judicial departments should focus on the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and the main tasks set by the national conference on 
judicial and public security work; while concentrating on the 
requirements for establishing a socialist market economic 
structure and on the task of ensuring the smooth progress of 
reform, they should conduct thorough investigations and studies, 
closely rely on the masses, further improve their standard of 
implementing policies and enforcing the law, and go all out to 
safeguard social and political stability. Procuratorial and 
judicial organs must uphold the people's democratic dictatorship 
to fully exercise their functions and role. All localities must 
promptly organize forces to effectively crack down on criminal 
elements and to resolutely check the increasing incidents of 
serious crimes; do a good job of providing legal services in 
line with the needs of the new situation; adhere to the 
principle of integrating specialized organs and the masses; 
implement the measures for the overall improvement of social 
security; do a good job in reforming procuratorial and judicial 
work; and strive to raise the standard of their work. 
  Chen Huanyou stressed: It is our steadfast principle to 
strengthen the party leadership over procuratorial and judicial 
work. Party committees and governments at all levels must 
further strengthen their leadership over this work and grasp 
firmly in their hands the important task of safeguarding social 
stability. He said: We must always concentrate on economic 
construction. At the same time, we must always bear in mind 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's elaboration of the principle of 
"grasping two links at the same time and attaching importance to 
both," never slacken our work of maintaining social and 
political stability, and never allow the erroneous tendency of 
grasping economic work while slackening efforts to fight crime 
to reappear again. In the future, we must act according to the 
stipulations of the party Central Committee and make the state 
of social security an important criterion for evaluating party 
leading cadres. Chen Huanyou said: Party committees, 
governments, and leading cadres at all levels must consciously 
safeguard the dignity of law and help procuratorial and judicial 
organs to strictly exercise their functions according to law. 
We must strengthen law enforcement supervision. Anyone who 
ignores the dignity of law and interferes with the handling of 
cases according to law, no matter who he is, must be strictly 
dealt with. We must effectively strengthen the building of a 
contingent of procuratorial and judicial personnel. First of 
all, we must strengthen the leading bodies of procuratorial and 
judicial organs by promoting to the leading bodies cadres who 
are young and capable, politically sound, professionally 
competent, and who are impartial in exercising their functions. 
At the same time, we must guard against admitting bad people 
into the leading bodies. We should pay attention to education 
and training work and raise the political and professional 
quality of the police force. Party committees and governments 
at all levels should show concern for and attach importance to 
the solution of practical difficulties faced by procuratorial 
and judicial organs. 
  Yu Xingde, member of the Standing Committee of the 
provincial 
party committee, provincial vice governor, and deputy secretary 
of the Commission on Politics and Law under the provincial party 
committee, made a summed-up report at the conference. He called 
on all localities to earnestly implement this conference's 
guidelines and ensure the fulfillment of this year's 
procuratorial and judicial tasks. He said: At present, it is 
imperative to ensure political and social stability around the 
time of the Spring Festival this year so as to guarantee that 
the people of the province will have a happy, harmonious, and 
peaceful Spring Festival. 
  Also attending the conference were Cao Keming, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee; and Hu Fuming, Gu 
Hao, and Li Yunshi, members of the Standing Committee of the 
provincial party committee.

Perspective: Corruption Inside CPC Might Break Off Reform

Cancer on the Mainland Once and for All"] 
  [Text]Foreword 
  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang, two specialists of the Group 
for Analyzing the National Situation, under the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences, recently completed a report on the national 
situation which is entitled "Rooting Out Corruption Through the 
Establishment of a New System." The report points out that 
special interest groups among the armed forces and bureaucrats 
have been formed within the CPC. The specialists warn in their 
report: The factor that has the greatest possibility of 
breaking off the process of reform and modernization in China 
comes from corruption within the CPC; therefore, development is 
the last word and anticorruption is also the last word [fa zhan 
shi ying dao li, fan fu bai ye shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2508 
4289 6670 3810 0646 5201 2408 0048 2508 4289 6670 3810]. Since 
corruption has become a kind of malignant cancer on the 
mainland, it cannot be rooted out by depending on "party 
discipline and state laws" alone. The only way out is "the 
establishment of a new system." 
  Dr. Hu Angang and Dr. Wang Shao-kuang, of the Political 
Faculty of Yale University in the United States, jointly 
completed "A Report on the State's Ability in China" last year 
and first put forward the replacement of the "overall contract 
system" with the "tax-sharing system" in order to strengthen the 
ability of the central administration. This has attracted much 
attention at home and abroad. 
  Kang Xiaoguang is 31 years old. He graduated from the 
Applied Mathematics Faculty of the Dalian Engineering College 
and later was awarded a master's degree in Theoretical Ecology 
by the Ecological and Environmental Research Center of the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences. In recent years, he has engaged 
himself in the study of China's national situation and his 
representative work is "Agriculture and Development -- A Study 
of Several Questions Concerning China's Agriculture," published 
by the Beijing University Press in 1993. 
  Beginning today, MING PAO will carry by installments an 
interview with Hu and Kang by our staff reporter, Mr. Liu Lu, in 
order to give a detailed account of their starting point in 
writing the report, as well as the report's main contents. 
[end foreword] 
  On the Chinese mainland today, the two major issues that 
have 
attracted the greatest attention of the people are inflation and 
corruption. If we say that the former occurs intermittently, 
then the latter has become more serious with each passing day. 
Therefore, the publication of the "report on the national 
situation" entitled "Opposing Corruption Through the 
Establishment of a New System" immediately attracted extremely 
great attention among political and academic circles. It is 
said that even before the report was published it had been 
submitted to the high-level CPC leadership as "reference 
material." 
  During a special interview with Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang 
a few days ago, this reporter asked them why they carried out a 
study on anticorruption as part of the national situation, they 
replied: Deng Xiaoping said after the 4 June incident: "If 
corruption, especially corruption at a high level within the 
party, is not punished, there is indeed a danger of failure." 
However, to date, the practice of corruption throughout the 
party, the Army, and the country has become more and more 
serious, instead of being brought under control. It has become 
an extremely common social phenomenon. It is not at all 
exaggerating to say that the degree of corruption on the Chinese 
mainland has become a kind of malignant cancer, which has spread 
rapidly to society as a whole. Corruption has become the 
greatest social pollution in China today. We are worried that 
in the future, the factor that will have the greatest 
possibility of breaking off the process of reform and 
modernization in China comes from the serious corruption within 
the CPC. 
  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said frankly: "The common 
people call some cadres `corrupt officials' and `local tyrants 
and evil gentry' without mincing words." Corruption within the 
CPC makes the CPC and its political power lose its foundation of 
legitimacy, meaning that the support of the common people for 
the party and the government is decreasing. This is one of the 
expressions of the universally declining state ability in China, 
that is, the ability for legitimation is decreasing. 
  "Water holds up ships, but also can drown them. [no closing 
quotation mark as published] If corruption is allowed to spread 
and if it is impossible to thoroughly solve the problem of 
corruption, particularly corruption at a high level within the 
party, it is not impossible that the Communist Party may fall 
from power because of corruption caused by the system. As a 
matter of fact, CPC leaders have been aware of this possibility. 
Jiang Zemin pointed out on the CPC's 70th founding anniversary 
that party style has a bearing on the party's existence and 
survival. If the corruption phenomenon is allowed to developed, 
the party will be on its way to self-destruction. In this 
sense, development is the last word and anticorruption is also 
the last word. 
  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: Deng Xiaoping repeatedly 
admonished: "The third-generation leadership should win the 
confidence of the people," and it is necessary to win the 
confidence of the people through punishing corruption. 
Apparently, whether or not the CPC's third-generation 
leadership can have legitimacy depends on whether or not it has 
the courage and determination to oppose corruption, whether or 
not it is able to oppose corruption in an effective way, and 
whether or not it can carry out its promise to the more than 1 
billion people. This is the fundamental reason why we have 
carried out this research. In the report on the national 
situation, we have proceeded from the worst possibility to 
forecast the worst possible ending as a warning. However, as 
scientists of China, we hope we are not successful prophets.

Angang [5170 7254 6921] and Kang Xiaoguang [1660 2556 0342] 
specialists of the Group for Analyzing the National Situation, 
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, by staff reporter Liu Lu 
(0491 7216); place, date not given: "Economic Conversion and 
System Defects Cause Corruption; Obstacles to Anticorruption 
Drive Come From Within CPC"] 
  [Text] I asked Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang: What are the 
root causes of corruption in China's realities? 
  They answered: "The national situation report `Thoroughly 
Eliminating Corruption Through Institutional Innovation' makes 
it clear that current corruption is mainly the corruption of the 
system. The main root causes of corrupt phenomena are the 
defects of the existing systems in the period of the 
market-oriented economic restructuring. In the process of 
transforming the economy into a market economy, differences 
exist between market prices and official prices. The larger the 
differences, the stronger the motivations for giving and taking 
bribes will become, and the more serious the corrupt phenomena 
will become. In the past, officials often were assumed to be 
"selfless." This assumption can hardly become true in economic 
society. As defects exist in the systems, honest people may 
rapidly become corrupt once they have power. The only solution 
is system innovation. In addition, the corruption activities 
also are related to the government's excessive interference in 
the market. If there were no market distortion and no special 
monopoly position caused by the government's excessive 
interference, there would be no foundation for the giving and 
taking of bribes. 
  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: "In our report, we also 
point out explicitly that the obstacles to the anticorruption 
drive on the Chinese mainland come primarily from with the CPC, 
and find their main expression in special interest groups of 
various types led by the Communists. The Communist Party is not 
a monolith, nor does everyone inside the party share the same 
interests and act in unison. Inside the party and within the 
state apparatus various special and independent economic 
interest groups and political interest groups have appeared. 
This is one of the most important characteristics of the 
prominent changes in the Chinese social structure since the 
beginning of reform. 
  The report summarizes the main characteristics of the 
special 
interest groups into following points: 
  -- Having the motivation of seeking and expanding their own 
interests to the maximum, and taking this as their purpose. 
They care only about increasing their own groups' gains and do 
not consider the losses in the aggregate social wealth. 
  -- Having the attributes of benefit-sharing groups, as they 
participate in the distribution of social resources and profits. 
Although they account for only a very small proportion of the 
population, they always are able to gain a much larger 
proportion of economic resources. 
  -- Having the character of being exclusive and holding a 
monopoly position. They exclude other groups from the 
benefit-sharing activities, block the free movement of economic 
factors, oppose the participation of other competitive rivals, 
and strive to increase their monopoly in society. When 
resisting external threats and rectification, they also may 
collaborate in order to protect each other, thus forming complex 
connection networks. 
  -- Having strong influence and causing "government 
ineffectiveness." They try to influence government policies, 
and even the top-level policy-making body, by every possible 
means. They demand excessive government interference or even 
direct interference by top decision-makers in order to obtain 
certain economic prerogatives or favorable policies. They also 
try by every possible means to oppose and obstruct the adoption 
of some reform measures that favor fair competition. 
  -- The vested interests are rather "rigid." That is, they 
can only increase and must not decrease the absolute interests 
they have gained, and the shares they gain can only increase and 
must not decrease. 
  Hu and Kang said: The above-mentioned characteristics 
determine that any major measure for reforming the existing 
systems inevitably will encounter strong opposition from the 
special interest groups. For example, many interest groups 
opposed the measures to lower import tariffs, lift import 
controls, and remove the foreign trade monopoly system. The 
difficulties in market-oriented reforms lie in the handling of 
such special interest groups.

Angang [5170 7254 6921] and Kang Xiaoguang [1660 2556 0342] 
specialists of the Group for Analyzing the National Situation, 
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, by staff reporter Liu Lu 
(0491 7216); place, date not given: "Anticorruption 
Perspective: `Keep the Armed Forces With Taxes,' and the Armed 
Forces Must Be Prohibited From Engaging in Business"] 
  [Text] Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said that they put 
forward five major reform proposals, and one of them was to 
prohibit the armed forces from engaging in business and to 
maintain the armed forces with tax revenues. 
  Hu and Kang explained: In a modern country, the armed forces 
should be kept with government appropriations and must not be 
allowed to engage in business activities. This is beyond 
question. "We hold that the armed forces can be maintained only 
with government appropriations, and must not engage in business 
activities, so the armed forces should be supported with tax 
revenues. At present, only in a very small number of countries, 
such as Indonesia and Thailand, are the armed forces engaged in 
business activities. In such countries, the degree of 
corruption in the armed forces is very serious. There, the 
armed forces have become a special interest group, independent 
from state interests, a group that seeks its own political, 
economic, and military interests. International experience 
shows that allowing the armed forces to do business is 
equivalent to giving a green light to corruption in the armed 
forces." 
  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang then changed their talk from 
international practice to China's reality: Since the 1980's, 
the Chinese armed forces have been deeply involved in 
large-scale business activities, which have spread to all three 
services and the three general departments of the headquarters. 
All military regions, provincial military districts, and field 
armies have set up their own business companies to pursue 
profits and increase their own financial incomes in order to 
make up for the serious insufficiencies in military expenses. 
As a result, this has quickened the pace of commercialization, 
localization, and corruption in the armed forces. The military 
officers have always been discontented with such developments. 
  However, the financial capacity of the central government 
has 
remained at a very low level. Although China's gross national 
product increased by more than 100 percent after 1978, the 
government still could not support the 3 million troops and 
repeatedly required the troops to "endure" difficulties. It 
allowed the troops to engage in business so that they might 
increase their income. This was a major failure of the central 
government in performing its functions, and was also a 
shortsighted practice that would result only in ruining national 
defense and sowing the seeds of future turmoil and unrest in 
China. Therefore, they put forward following proposals: 
  -- Strictly prohibiting the armed forces from engaging in 
business. Business companies of all types established and run 
by the armed forces should be closed down. This should include 
the farms run by all military units. The assets may be 
transferred or auctioned off. The military units cannot take 
part in any profit-making economic activities, and should not be 
allowed to receive any gifts or allowances from local 
governments and civilian institutions. 
  -- The military budget should be increased substantially, 
and 
the armed forces should be maintained with state tax revenues. 
Military expenses should come entirely from the government's 
financial appropriations, which should be sufficient for 
maintaining the normal operations of the armed forces in 
peacetime. That is, it is necessary to ensure that the armed 
forces' income in real terms will increase at a rate slightly 
higher than the growth rate of the average income of the 
civilian people throughout the country. Special appropriations 
should be made in wartime to make up for the insufficiency in 
military expenses. The scheme of "supporting the armed forces 
with tax revenues" may be put into practice in two steps. 
First, supporting the regular units with tax revenue, and 
strictly prohibiting the field armies, the navy, and the air 
force from engaging in business activities. Second, strictly 
prohibiting all troops from engaging in business activities. 
  -- Part of the public property for national defense may be 
produced through the market. For example, military provisions, 
medicine, clothing, and other supplies, as well as airports, 
roads, equipment, and instruments can be produced by 
manufacturers that bid for orders placed by the military. Thus, 
the armed forces do not need to strive for "self-sufficiency" by 
arranging the production of everything they need. The General 
Logistics Department will be just a "big buyer," and it will 
decide what to buy from the market and will not be responsible 
for what to produce. Most military enterprises should be 
separated from the regular establishment of the armed forces so 
that the size of the armed forces can be streamlined as well, 
with noncombat units being reduced. 
  -- Redefining the armed forces' tasks and reducing excessive 
nonmilitary expenditures. In modern society, the armed forces 
should not perform too many functions and shoulder 
responsibilities and burdens that are too heavy. Their major 
function is to defend the country, and they should mainly be a 
fighting force rather than a productive force. The armed forces 
should not be turned into a major force in industrial production 
or an entity in economic activities. They should not get 
involved in the market economy or participate in any 
profit-seeking or illicit business activities; still less should 
they participate in local economic construction and be turned 
into an unpaid or low-paid labor force. Of course, resisting 
disasters and rescuing disaster-stricken people will remain one 
of the functions the armed forces should perform. The armed 
forces in all countries perform such functions.

Angang (5170 7254 6921) and Kang Xiaoguang (1660 2556 9342) 
specialists of the Group for Analyzing the National Situation, 
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, by staff reporter 
Liu Lu [0491 7216]; place, date not given: "Officials Must 
Avoid `Increasing Incomes by Various Means,' and System of 
`Keeping Clean and Honest Officials With High Salaries' Must be 
Implemented"] 
  [Text] On the question of party members and government 
officials "increasing their incomes by various means," a 
corruption phenomenon currently prevailing over the mainland, Hu 
Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: "We maintain that officials 
have to live on `imperial funds' rather than engage in trade or 
`seek higher incomes' under all sorts of pretexts. It is 
necessary to `maintain government officials mainly by taxes.' 
To put it another way, through mandatory tax collection, the 
government pays the wages of government officials and working 
personnel with state expenditures. In developed industrialized 
countries, this portion of wage is called the `bureaucrat [guan 
liao 1351 0297] wage,' which is usually higher than, or the same 
as, the average wage level offered by the departments in the 
private sector to their employees." 
  Both of them stressed: Adopting a high-wage system, which is 
in line with the theory of manpower capital investment returns, 
will help continuously absorb outstanding social elements into 
the contingent of government bureaucrats. At the same time, as 
government bureaucrats enjoy relatively ample wage incomes and 
relatively handsome standards of living and will lose the 
temporary benefits of corruption for all their lives, the risk 
of the benefits of "bureaucrat wage" will become greater. On 
the contrary, if a low-wage system is adopted, on the one hand, 
this will cause a drain of outstanding talented people in large 
quantities and a drop in the quality of personnel and, on the 
other hand, as wage remunerations are lower than the amount of 
manpower officials invest as capital and labor they contribute, 
they are bound to seek new self-compensations through illegal 
revenue channels. Under the current low-wage system, officials 
are now enjoying "stable incomes" in forms such as covert 
housing allowances, special vehicles and planes, confusion of 
public and private incomes, and in rules and regulations. 
  The report on national conditions entitled "Remedy 
Corruption 
Permanently by Institutional Upgrading" suggested: 
  --Practicing a bureaucrat high-wage system. The 
average wage level of the cadres of government organizations 
should be increased by a wide margin so it will be higher than 
that of the nation's employees. The average wage level of the 
cadres of central government organizations should be set a 
little higher. The wage level of cadres at the ministerial 
level should reach a high-income level, which should be 
determined and made public by the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress once a year. 
  --Scrapping all kinds of covert subsidies for 
officials. Subsidies in such areas as housing, driving 
compact cars, and health care, should be directly counted as 
part of wages. All "special supply" avenues and free-of-charge 
or low-charge special services should be abolished. Officials' 
various incomes should be transferred, paid, recorded, and 
supervised through bank accounts, and at the same time, they 
should pay income and property taxes according to law. Leaders' 
income, property, and tax payments, which judicial and taxation 
organs are entitled to verify and check, should be made public 
at non-regular intervals if necessary. 
  --Cutting the number of government administrative 
levels and the size of working personnel by one third or 
more. Regional-level administrative setups, ministries of 
various industries, and other regional industrial bureaus should 
be replaced by industrial associations. Party and government 
organizations should be strictly prohibited from engaging in 
trade and operate companies of various types. 
  --Prohibiting cadres at provincial and ministerial 
levels to hold any posts or concurrent posts in companies of 
various types after retirement. 
  --Firmly checking sons and daughters of senior cadres 
from engaging in trade during the period of transition to a 
market economy. It is necessary to reaffirm the decision, 
which the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made on 28 
July 1989, that the spouses of members of the Central Political 
Bureau, the Secretariat, and the Executive Committee of the 
State Council, their sons and daughters and their sons' and 
daughters' spouses are prohibited from carring out business 
activities in the distribution sector and from holding any posts 
or concurrent posts in companies engaged in the sector. This 
decision must be applicable to the spouses of retired leaders of 
the Central Committee and the State Council and their sons and 
daughters and their sons' and daughters' spouses.

Angang [5170 7254 6921] and Kang Xiaoguang [1660 2556 0342] 
specialists of the Group for Analyzing the National Situation, 
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, by staff reporter 
Liu Lu (0491 7216); place, date not given: "High Customs Duties 
Are Not Beneficial to Opening Up; Foreign Trade Monopolies Must 
Be Canceled"] 
  [Text] Control of foreign trade by the means of import 
quotas and import permits has become one of the main sources of 
corruption in mainland China's foreign trade sector and 
companies. Therefore one of the policy suggestions presented by 
Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang to the CPC higher leadership in 
their national condition study report entitled "Root Out 
Corruption Through Systemic Reform" is "to lower the customs 
tariff rate and remove non-tariff trade barriers." 
  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: Although high customs 
tariffs can serve to protect national industries in their 
infancy, such a policy will be unfavorable to their efforts to 
go beyond their infancy. When these industries are monopolized 
by a few enterprises, these enterprises may give up their 
efforts to upgrade their technology, improve product quality, 
and increase their competitive power on the market because they 
are protected by high customs tariffs. In any case, they will 
continue to enjoy a profit rate much higher than that enjoyed by 
other industries. In this regard, mainland China's automobile 
industry is a very typical case. The net prices of automobiles, 
either completely manufactured automobiles or those assembled in 
China, are much higher than the market prices of products in the 
same categories in the United States and Japan. Therefore, one 
should lower the tariff rate for imported cars by a wide margin 
and lift the restrictions on car imports rather than devote much 
energy to fighting car smuggling. 
  Hu and Kang's analysis shows that mainland China's foreign 
trade structure, especially the import structure, still retains 
some very conspicuous characteristics of the planned economy, 
such as foreign trade monopolies, import license and control, 
and high customs tariffs. The general managers of some 
companies dealing in foreign trade put it bluntly: "If 
enterprises were vested with the power to run import-export 
trade, what would we rely on for survival?" It is obvious to 
all that artificially imposed customs tariff barriers, foreign 
trade monopolies, and high tariff rates are, in substance, the 
components of a government policy protecting a small number of 
government-run organizations, monopoly groups, and vested 
interest groups, as well as some manufacturers. This policy has 
been hindering the overall opening up of the Chinese economy and 
is unfavorable to the effort to promote competition at home and 
abroad. 
  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang have put forward the following 
proposals: 
  -- To lower the customs tariff rate and lift non-tariff 
import restrictions. To rescind the import license system for 
major commodities, lift administrative control of commodity 
imports, reduce tariff rates, and simplify the tariff system. 
To withdraw the authorization for localities to reduce import 
tariffs or to grant import tariff exemptions. The power to levy 
tariffs should go to the central government. 
  -- To rescind the foreign trade monopolies, authorize 
enterprises to handle import-export business directly, and treat 
state-owned enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises equally. 
Enterprises' qualification to run import-export business should 
be examined and approved by the departments concerned. Permits 
for the import of major commodities can be put on public auction. 
  -- To lift the ban on foreign-funded business establishments 
running commerce, trade, banking, insurance, communications and 
transport, postal and telecommunication services, real estate, 
and tourism, so as to increase the competitive power of the 
domestic tertiary industry sector. 
  -- To effect a gradual transition to the commodity price 
framework of the international market, and to link the 
international and domestic markets. 
  -- To implement a policy to protect China's agriculture and 
some industries in their infancy, while introducing a more 
liberal policy to mitigate the monopolies in the automobile 
industry, the petrochemical industry, and so on.

Angang (5170 7254 6921) and Kang Xiaoguang (1660 2556 0342) 
specialists of the Group for Analyzing the National Situation, 
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, by staff reporter 
Liu Lu [0941 7216]; place and date not given: "Anticorruption 
Perspective: Official Interest Rates Must Be Canceled, Because 
They Undermine Principle of Fair Competition"] 
  [Text] In recent years, a considerable proportion of the 
corruption cases which have been publicly disclosed in mainland 
China have involved people in the financial sector. This author 
asked He Angang and Kang Xiaoguang to comment on this issue. 
  They said that the capital factor is the most inadequate of 
all the factors of production, and the source of economic growth 
could also become a bottleneck to economic growth. Under the 
conditions of a market economy, that "all men are equal before 
the interest rate" is one basic condition for the main bodies of 
various economic sectors to enjoy fair competition and economic 
freedom. 
  In a report on the national situation, which is entitled 
"Radically Curing Corruption With an Innovative System," Hu and 
Kang gave a definition of "corruption" as an activity of "lease 
seeking [xun zu 1416 4436]." The essence of "lease seeking" 
activity is to exchange power for money. The party with money 
is a lease seeker, and the party with power is a government 
official. The economic rent [jing ji zu jin 4842 3444 4436 
6855] is tantamount to the price difference between the market 
and official rates. The greatest amount of "rent" on the 
mainland now is the interest rate on bank loans. The government 
still intervenes in most credit lines and forcibly fixes 
interest rates. The spread between different interest rates can 
be shared by the government and loan applicants. For many years, 
state-run banks have charged official interest rates to some 
enterprises, chiefly state-run enterprises, and market rates to 
other enterprises, chiefly those which are not state-owned. 
Moreover, official interest rates are much lower than market 
rates, and bank presidents and credit personnel give 
preferential treatment to the former by granting them credit 
lines, but they have discriminated against the latter. This is 
a typical practice of the "theory of the unique importance of 
class origin," which has disrupted the market economy principle 
of fair competition, and is one of the principal causes which 
has brought about a distorted money market and corrupt phenomena. 
  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang made the following proposals to 
policymakers in their report on the national situation: 
  -- Practice a market interest rate system and abandon 
official interest rates. Under this system, deposit interest 
rates should fluctuate with loan interest rates, commercial 
banks have the right to decide interest rates independently, and 
government departments have no right to give directives to 
commercial banks about their credit and interest rate levels. 
Relaxation of interest rate controls should be effected in two 
steps: 1) gradually raising official rates and incrementally 
lifting restriction on credit lines as decided by market rates; 
2) unifying official rates with market rates and abandoning 
restrictions on credit lines. 
  -- Promote the development of commercial banks and allow 
fair 
competition between banks. Restrictions on banking businesses 
(including regional restrictions and trade restrictions) should 
be lifted, nongovernmental banks should be allowed to grow, and 
foreign commercial banks should be allowed to participate in 
domestic competition. The major specialized banks should be 
broken down into relatively small banks and should accelerate 
the establishment of a fair competition mechanism. 
  -- Provide loans to enterprises by mortgaging their assets 
(capital). If enterprises default on their loan repayments, or 
their assets do not offset their debts, these can be confiscated 
by the banks and sold to society by auction. 
  -- Subsidize basic industries including agriculture, 
communications, transportation, telecommunications, and so on 
with loans granted to them with government financial discounts, 
and change some of the money used to support and assist 
impoverished areas into subsidies by way of financial discounts 
to help them develop their economies.

Angang (5170 7254 6921) and Kang Xiaoguang (1660 2556 0342), 
specialists of the Group for Analyzing the National Situation, 
under the Chinese Academy of Social Science, by staff reporter 
Liu Lu (0491 7216); date, place not given: "Fight Against 
Corruption Cannot Rely on Campaigns; Gradual Political Reforms 
Can Work"] 
  [Text] There is a cost to reforms. I asked Hu Angang and 
Kang Xiaoguang: "Have you ever calculated the cost of your 
anticorruption measures?" 
  They replied: The two anticorruption measures we have 
proposed -- "maintaining the Army with regular taxes" and 
"maintaining the government with regular taxes" -- do require 
huge expenses from the government; the precondition for them is 
that the state must boost its powers to increase revenue. This 
issue has been addressed in a national situation report, 
entitled: "Report on China's State Powers," coauthored by Hu 
Angang and another scholar, Wang Shaoguang, in which they made a 
detailed analysis of the problem. What we are proposing -- like 
lowering tariff rates, abolishing non- tariff trade barriers and 
foreign trade franchises, and seriously restricting monopolies 
-- does not require many government resources, except a 
reduction in tariff income. Howver, what we gain from 
stimulating technological imports and promoting the 
competitiveness of domestic enterprises will be far greater. 
Breaking trade monopolies will reduce social trade costs by a 
considerable margin. The deregulation of interest rates and 
merging them with market rates, as we propose, will earn the 
government handsome revenues, because when commercial banks earn 
huge profits, the government will obtain enormous resources from 
the banks' profit remittances and through taxing them. 
  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang stressed: The ability to halt 
graft is a yardstick by which we can meaure if a political 
system is really institutionalized and efficient. We believe 
that stamping out corruption through institutional innovation 
depends on the progress not only of economic, but also political 
structural reforms, and of the development of socialist 
democratic politics. As political development in China trails 
economic development, and political structural reforms lag 
behind economic structural reforms, the focus of the next reform 
program should be an active and steady push for political 
structural reform. 
  This, then, requires other significant reformist measures; 
for example: the division and checks of political powers, the 
scope and delimitation of government functions, streamlining and 
restructuring government organizations, the pursuit of a civil 
service system and the improvement of government officials' 
quality, strengthening the supervisory system, asserting the 
independence of the judiciary, improving the legal system, 
allowing the media a watchdog role, and so on. 
  On the means of pursuing the anticorruption campaign, Hu 
Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: The anticorruption campaign 
cannot rely on mass movements or political campaigns, which 
cannot tackle the institutional flaws and failings from which 
corruption grew. The former two either spawn confusion or 
result in turmoil. 
  The fight against corruption is an institutionally 
innovative 
activity. It must be carefully designed, thoroughly organized, 
and patiently enforced. Its completion will not be in fiery and 
noisy campaigns or revolution, but the end result of a daily, 
orderly, almost undetectable process. There has never been any 
significant social reform in history that "owed its success to 
one decisive battle." The most successful road for 
institutional reform is that of active gradualness.

of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" column: 
"Southern Jiangsu's Successful Practice of Building Socialism 
With Chinese Characteristics"] 
  [Text] Southern Jiangsu is a geographic concept, which 
generally refers to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, located on the 
Chang Jiang Delta in southern part of Jiangsu Province. This is 
a vast area of fertile land. Amid the great tides of reform, 
opening up, and modernization construction, southern Jiangsu 
presents us with a brand-new pattern for economic and social 
development which is characterized by its distinctive local 
feature. This is land on which tens of millions of hard-working 
peasants are forging ahead along the road of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. 
  As early as 1983, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, chief designer of 
China's reform and opening up, spoke highly of the reform and 
construction of southern Jiangsu during an inspection tour to 
the region. At that time, the Suzhou area enjoyed a per capita 
annual industrial and agricultural output volume of nearly $800, 
taking the lead in the country in solving people's problems 
concerning food, clothing, daily necessities, housing, 
employment, education, culture, and other areas of public 
welfare. Tremendous changes also took place in the mental 
outlook of people there. Upon his return to Beijing from 
inspection trips to Jiangsu and other places, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping pointed out in speeches -- which have been collected in 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping: 
"Evidently, the realization of the four modernizations promises 
high hopes of success." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, p. 24) A year later, at a meeting held by 
the central authorities, Comrade Deng Xiaoping again cited the 
example of southern Jiangsu, saying: "Their creations alone are 
amazing achievements!" "Material goods serve as a foundation. 
When our people enjoy a better material life and an enhanced 
cultural standard, their mental outlook surely will undergo 
great changes." (op. cit., p. 89) 
  Today, southern Jiangsu has taken more strides along the 
road 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. As soon as 
they set their foot on this hot land, people will be infected by 
the tremendous enthusiasm of the southern Jiangsu people engaged 
in the socialist construction, and will be filled with 
admiration at the remarkable results they have attained in the 
building of two civilizations. Facts have proved 
incontrovertibly that the success of southern Jiangsu is nothing 
less than a great creation of the southern Jiangsu people under 
the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
<H3>  Arduous Yet Successful Explorations Under the Guidance of 
the Theory of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics </H3>
  Southern Jiangsu's successful practice can be attributed to 
its superiorities in natural resources, geographic location, and 
economic strength. However, superior objective natural 
conditions cannot create social miracles. For a considerably 
long period of time, the economic structure of southern Jiangsu 
as a whole did not display any fundamental differences from the 
economic structures of other areas in the country. The rural 
reform, which features the contracted responsibility system with 
remuneration linked to output, serves as an opportunity for 
China's rural areas to change from stagnant growth to 
prosperity. The vast numbers of cadres and masses in southern 
Jiangsu have seized this opportunity firmly. Relying on the 
immense energy released by the impact of reform and on their 
advantages accumulated through the collective economy, they have 
proceeded from realistic conditions and their own demands, put 
into effect the contracted responsibility system on a household 
basis with remuneration linked to output, and established 
peasants' autonomy in production and management. They have 
broken with egalitarism in distribution, and have allowed and 
encouraged some people to get rich first, thus considerably 
arousing the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of peasants to get 
rich through hard work. They gradually have lifted controls on 
the prices of agricultural and sideline products, eliminated a 
series of obstacles set by the system of unified purchases and 
distribution, and brought about great increases in the rural 
commodity rate. What needs to be specially mentioned is their 
vigorous effort to develop town and township industries; as a 
result, they have opened a new field for transferring surplus 
rural labor forces to nonagricultural industries, thus 
accelerating the process of turning the natural economy of rural 
areas into a commodity economy. 
  Town and township industries are a great creation of the 
Chinese peasants, and the cadres and masses in southern Jiangsu 
have made outstanding contributions to this creation. Like all 
new things, town and township industries were not welcomed with 
flowers and applause when they first made their appearance in 
the historical arena; rather, they have experienced a winding 
course of development. During the period dominated by the 
planned economy, town and township enterprises had no planned 
products, no planned supply of raw and supplementary materials 
and energy, and no planned sales quotas or channels. What they 
could do was to find "rice" to "cook" and borrow "hens" to "lay 
eggs," and such practices invited all kinds of criticisms and 
accusations, claiming that these industries "were pounding the 
planned economy," "scrambling with state-owned enterprises for 
raw materials and markets," "undermining socialism," and "giving 
rise to unhealthy trends." In the face of such great pressure, 
the cadres and masses of southern Jiangsu believed that the road 
they were taking was the correct one, for the establishment of 
town and township industries tallies with the economic and 
social development rules in rural areas of southern Jiangsu, and 
also conforms to the interests of the vast numbers of peasants, 
as well as their hopes for extricating themselves from poverty 
and bringing about common prosperity. In June 1987, Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping set a high value on town and township enterprises: 
Our biggest unexpected harvest is the development and rise of 
town and township enterprises. He later stressed on many 
occasions: "Town and township enterprises are very important, 
and need to be further developed and enhanced." (op. cit., p. 
355) The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have 
issued many important documents and have called many important 
meetings to reaffirm the value of town and township industries, 
and to stress the need for giving them policy support and 
guidance. All this has served as great encouragement to the 
cadres and masses of southern Jiangsu, and also has provided a 
fundamental guarantee for town and township industries to attain 
rapid growth on a smooth road. Since then, peasants have 
started to run industries, thus expediting the process of 
industrialization, urbanization, agricultural mechanization, and 
modernization in rural areas. This was the first great rise for 
town and township enterprises in the 1980's. The second rise 
started in 1992 and featured export-oriented high-tech 
industries, thus bringing about a satisfying situation wherein 
town and township enterprises are run in a large scale and can 
produce high-grade and fine-quality products. At present, town 
and township enterprises in southern Jiangsu have established 
their position as a pillar of the entire rural economy. Relying 
on the tremendous economic strength created by town and township 
industries, the collective economy that depends mainly on the 
public ownership has been consolidated constantly, the rural 
modernization has begun to take off, and the construction of 
small towns and townships has accelerated continuously. As a 
result, tens of millions of peasants are leading a fairly 
comfortable life. The success of southern Jiangsu in using its 
distinctive features to explore a road of development has 
sketched a brand-new portrait of socialist modern rural areas. 
  -- The economy of southern Jiangsu is growing at an 
unprecedentedly high speed. During the period from 1979 to 
1992, the GNP of southern Jiangsu grew at an average annual rate 
of 16.5 percent, with the total value ten times higher than 
before. Most of the counties (cities) in the rural areas of 
southern Jiangsu have doubled once and again their annual total 
industrial and agricultural output values, among which some 
could double their output value in about five years. Take the 
case of Wuxi County, which ranks first among China's 100 best 
counties in comprehensive indexes. From 1978 to 1991, the 
county's average GNP went up by 20.2 percent every year; the per 
capita distribution level of peasants rose by 18.4 percent; and 
its total financial income by 12.71 percent. Moreover, the 
county attained the goal of quadrupling its industrial and 
agricultural production ahead of schedule. 
  -- In the rural economic structure of southern 
Jiangsu, the proportion of the nonagricultural sector 
miraculously has surpassed that of the agricultural sector, and 
definitely has become a pillar industry. By the year 1992, 
the total industrial output value of town and township 
industries in southern Jiangsu accounted for over two thirds of 
the total economic value of society. The Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou 
region, which has a population accounting for only 0.88 percent 
of the country's total, attained a total town and township 
industrial output value amounting to 16.8 percent of the 
country's total. 
  -- The rural areas of southern Jiangsu have adopted 
positive measures to coordinate relations between industry and 
agriculture so as to stabilize and develop agricultural 
production. Fine-quality and highly efficient agricultural 
production bases have been set up to push forward the process of 
putting into use machinery, chemicals, improved varieties, water 
conservancy, and social services in agriculture. During the 
Seventh Five-Year Plan, the agricultural aid funds provided by 
the southern Jiangsu region reached a figure higher than 4 
billion yuan, or five times higher than the state input during 
the same period. Relying on the real strength of the collective 
economy, Wuxi County has set up more than 600 small farms of all 
types at all levels, and has ensured well-coordinated 
development in primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in 
rural areas. 
  -- The progress of rural economic development in 
southern Jiangsu has brought about profound changes in the 
economic and social structure of rural areas. A large 
number of small towns and townships have emerged, and have 
become commercially prosperous hubs that link urban and rural 
areas on the basis of fairly complete facilities and functions, 
and convenient transport conditions. In addition, they have 
become hot spots for peasants to live and work. This move has 
improved the conditions and quality of peasants' production and 
life to a considerable extent, and has greatly accelerated the 
process of turning the rural industrial structure into a 
nonagricultural structure, as well as the process of urbanizing 
the population mix. 
  -- With strong economic backing, all social 
undertakings and the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization in rural areas of southern Jiangsu have attained 
remarkable progress. The rural areas of southern Jiangsu 
have made great improvements in educational conditions, and rank 
among the country's best in perfecting the educational system 
and in good teaching facilities. Fairly rapid growth also has 
been attained in all kinds of social undertakings, including 
medical care and public health, culture and sports, press and 
television, social insurance, public welfare, urban 
afforestation, and family planning. The rural areas of southern 
Jiangsu now have basically reached their goal of providing the 
young with education, the old with old-age care, the sick with 
proper medical treatment, and the victims of natural disasters 
with sufficient relief. As a result, people in the region have 
taken on an entirely new mental outlook, and public security 
there is also quite satisfactory. 
-- The glorious accomplishments achieved by the rural 
areas of southern Jiangsu through their hard struggle have been 
recognized unanimously by all sectors of society. Among 
China's 100 best rural counties with strong comprehensive 
economic strength in 1991, 11 counties (cities) among the 12 in 
southern Jiangsu ranked among the first of the 100 counties. 
According to an appraisal made by the Jiangsu Provincial 
Statistics Bureau in 1992 of the comprehensive economic strength 
of more than 2,000 towns and townships throughout the province, 
the first 10 of the province's "100 best towns and townships" 
were towns and townships in southern Jiangsu. The enhancement 
of the region's real economic strength has given general 
expression to the accomplishments attained in practice by 
southern Jiangsu, and also to the region's success in practice. 
<H3>  "Three Main Bodies," "Two Coordinations," and "One Common" 
-- Southern Jiangsu's Distinctive Experience Gained Through 
Practice </H3>
  The rural areas of southern Jiangsu have opened up a road 
for 
development with special regional features, and have given shape 
to a unique pattern for economic and social development: "The 
Southern Jiangsu Pattern." The following are its salient 
features: 
  "Three main bodies" -- Regard public ownership and the 
collective economy as the main body of the ownership structure; 
regard town and township industries as the main body of the 
industrial structure; and regard market orientation as the main 
body of the economic operational mechanism. 
  "Two coordinations" -- Bring about coordinated 
development among the region's economic and social sectors, and 
coordinated development between building the material and the 
spiritual civilizations. 
  "One common" -- Uphold the principles of distribution 
according to work and of more pay for more work; take into 
account the interests of the state, the collective, and the 
individual; and open up a road for gradually bringing common 
prosperity to peasants within the community. 
  "The Southern Jiangsu Pattern" is one of the rural 
development patterns that emerged in China during the process of 
transforming traditional agriculture into modern agriculture, 
and transforming a natural economy into a large-scale commodity 
economy. In addition, the pattern is also a great achievement 
attained by the peasants of southern Jiangsu who, proceeding 
from realities, integrate the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics with the realistic conditions of 
southern Jiangsu, take their own road, and build up the new 
socialist countryside with the characteristics of southern 
Jiangsu. Their success can been observed in the following 
aspects: 
  First, They have consolidated and perfectd socialist 
public ownership, integrated efforts to give play to the 
advantages of the collective economy with efforts to mobilize 
the enthusiasm of laborers, and enabled rural productive forces 
to grow at a high speed. 
  Known for its very solid and powerful collective economy, 
the 
rural areas of southern Jiangsu persistently have regarded the 
collective economy as the main body of the ownership structure. 
In the process of effecting the contracted responsibility 
system with remuneration linked to output, this region has paid 
attention to stabilizing and reinforcing the foundation of the 
collective economy, created a management mechanism whereby 
unified management is combined with separate management, and 
effectively integrated efforts to give play to the advantages of 
the collective economy with efforts to mobilize the individual 
enthusiasm of peasants. Of southern Jiangsu's total industrial 
output value in 1992, the output value of industries under 
collective ownership accounted for 80.52 percent, while the 
proportion of production-oriented fixed assets owned by the 
second-grade collective economy reached as high as 91.8 percent. 
Facts have proved that the ownership structure of southern 
Jiangsu, with the collective economy as its main body, can 
entirely meet the development needs of productive forces at the 
present stage, and not only can accommodate but also can greatly 
push forward the development of productive forces. The endless 
vitality and superiority of the collective economy have been 
displayed by its powerful strength in coordinating economic 
interests among all sectors in rural areas, and in pushing 
forward the development of town and township industries, 
agriculture, and other trades. 
  Second, They have readjusted the industrial structure, 
regarded town and township industries as pillar industries, and 
relied on their own resources to create the material conditions 
for attaining well-coordinated development in all industries and 
trades in rural areas. 
  It is another prominent sign of the comprehensive and 
successful development of southern Jiangsu to rely on industries 
for well-coordinated development among agriculture, sideline 
production, industry, and commerce, and for all-round growth in 
the rural economy. Relying on its natural links with urban 
industries and commerce, the southern Jiangsu region entered the 
industrial sphere earlier than other regions across the country. 
In addition, it has continuously increased the proportion of 
industries, increased the total quantity of industries, 
reorganized the industrial structure of rural areas, and 
gradually taken to the road of rural industrialization. In 
southern Jiangsu, people already have reached this consensus: 
Without strong town and township industries, there will be no 
stable agriculture, no flourishing tertiary industries, no 
blooming construction of small towns and townships, and no 
comprehensive prosperity of the entire urban and rural economy. 
  Third, They have made full use of the market mechanism; 
broken down barriers between regions, and between urban and 
rural areas; and accelerated economic development according to 
the needs of the market. 
  The market economy is a highly efficient economic means of 
pushing forward the development of the socialist economy. The 
secret of southern Jiangsu's rapid economic takeoff lies in its 
persistence in carrying out market-oriented reform. An 
enterprise has to face the market right from its birth, and then 
grow and strengthen through the trials of the market. Its 
production and management should rely entirely on the 
orientation of the market and should suit the changes of the 
market. Its main factors of production will not depend on the 
distribution and supply of the state, but be determined by the 
market. It should withstand the trials of market competition in 
which only the superior can survive, and its fate will be 
decided by its victory or failure in market competition. Led by 
town and township enterprises, the entire economy of southern 
Jiangsu will take positive steps to adapt itself to the demands 
of the market and will make full use of the market operational 
mechanism. This has been reflected mainly by the following: 
Relying on the market to seek opportunities to expand 
enterprises through many ways; opening up new markets, relying 
on large and medium-sized cities and major industries, and 
building up all-positioned multilevel domestic and overseas 
market systems; making use of the market, extensively 
assimilating and organizing social resources, and accelerating 
the cultivation of markets for all major factors of production. 
We can say without any exaggeration that southern Jiangsu, 
especially town and township enterprises in southern Jiangsu, 
are pioneers in the development of the socialist market economy. 
  Fourth, They have brought about well-coordinated 
economic and social development, and paid attention to 
strengthening the building of material civilization while 
building up a high-degree of socialist spiritual 
civilization. 
  The more we carry out reform and opening up, the more we 
need 
to strengthen the building of the socialist spiritual 
civilization. This gradually has become a consensus among the 
cadres and masses in the southern Jiangsu region. People in 
southern Jiangsu have realized through practice that all work 
should obey and serve the key task of economic construction, and 
that failure to boost the economy will mean no accomplishment in 
all other fields. Only when we uphold two civilizations can we 
bring about and ensure healthy, stable, and rapid development 
[jian kang, wen bu, xun su fa zhan 0256 1660 4489 2975 6598 6643 
4099 1455] in economic construction; only when we strengthen the 
building of spiritual civilization around the center of economic 
construction can we attain well- coordinated development in the 
building of the two civilizations. Through more than 10 years of 
exploration and summarization, this region has accumulated the 
following rich experiences: 1) Leaders at all levels have 
attached great importance to building the two civilizations. 
Principal leaders of party and government organizations in all 
localities and departments persistently do two types of work 
simultaneously, attaching equal importance to both; 2) Attention 
has been paid to the "five major buildings" of ideology, moral 
practice, culture, democracy and the legal system, and social 
public utilities; 3) Efforts have been made to stress input and 
infrastructure, to make full use of economic strength 
accumulated in the course of high-speed economic growth, and to 
reinforce the basics and hardware of spiritual civilization; 4) 
Strides have been taken to place emphasis on planning and 
implementation, to regard the building of the spiritual 
civilization as an important part of creating a sound investment 
environment, and to list this as one of their work targets; 5) A 
series of effective mass activities has been carried out to 
promote the building of the spiritual civilization and to guide 
the masses to participate and receive education. Such 
activities include systematic appraisals of outstanding 
households with new social practices and civilized villages and 
towns. 
  Fifth, They have upheld the principle of distribution 
according to work, opposed egalitarianism while preventing 
polarization, and guided the vast numbers of peasants onto the 
road of common prosperity. 
  The practice in rural areas of the contracted responsibility 
system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output 
serves to break away from the production and distribution 
patterns of the past, which featured "large-scale operation" and 
"everybody eating from the same big pot." Relying on the 
collective economy, governments and social organizations at all 
levels in southern Jiangsu have set up a multi-element interest 
distribution mechanism, which relies mainly on cooperative 
economic organizations in towns and villages, so as to regulate 
interest relations among all sectors of rural areas; to handle 
correctly relations among the state, the collective, and the 
laborers; to unify in an appropriate way the policy of allowing 
some of the people to get rich first with the target of 
attaining common prosperity; to uphold the principle of placing 
the primary stress on efficiency, while giving fair 
consideration to issues of secondary importance; to put into 
effect within the collective economy a general practice of 
"sharing profits gained from industrial production, shouldering 
risks in agricultural production, and allowing each sideline 
product to try its best"; and to rationalize the income gap of 
labors in the community through a practice that relies mainly on 
distribution according to work, makes allowance distribution 
(such as encouraging the subsidization and development of 
agriculture by industry) supplementary, and advocates common 
consumption (such as community welfare undertakings). "With 
neither nouveau riches nor poverty-stricken households, every 
family is leading a fairly comfortable life" -- this is a vivid 
depiction of how peasants in this region are taking to the road 
of common prosperity. 
  "Three main bodies, two coordinations, and one common" is a 
new road opened up by the rural areas of southern Jiangsu in the 
process of reform, opening up, and modernization drive, as well 
as an illustrative and concrete practice of the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics in this region. 
From this successful practice, people can find strong evidence 
to prove that Comrade Deng Xiaoping is correct in his definition 
of the essence of socialism, that is, "to emancipate and develop 
the productive forces, eliminate polarization, and bring about 
common prosperity." 
<H3>  Study New Situations, Solve New Problems, and Constantly 
Deepen the Practice of Building Socialism With Chinese 
Characteristics in Southern Jiangsu </H3>
  The experience gained by southern Jiangsu is also a 
successful experience that has passed the test of practice, and 
has undergone constant improvement and attained new progress 
alongside the development of practice. The most precious point 
about southern Jiangsu's experience is that the region has never 
rested content with what it has achieved, never relaxed its 
efforts to forge ahead, and never stopped on the same spot. 
This is because the concept of remaining at the same level 
tallies neither with the Marxist outlook on development nor with 
the nature of the southern Jiangsu people. At the initial stage 
of the development of town and township industries, peasants in 
the region created something by carrying out a practice whereby 
peasants worked at factories in the daytime and in the fields at 
night, "acted as both workers and peasants," "left the fields 
without leaving their homeland," and "entered factories without 
entering cities." Alongside the constant enhancement in the 
level of productive forces and in economic strength, they have 
created other brand-new experiences in exercising an appropriate 
scale of land operation and running various kinds of farms 
through the collectivization of agriculture and intensive 
management, thus bringing about bright prospects for a second 
takeoff since the adoption of the contracted responsibility 
system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output. 
Similar new creations can be seen in many fields in the 
development of southern Jiangsu. Today, the experience of 
southern Jiangsu has attracted public attention, yet the cadres 
and masses of southern Jiangsu have a broader view, and are 
always trying to correct their mistakes and put pressure on 
themselves in order to attain greater results in the future. 
  The establishment of the socialist market economy system is 
a 
profound change. During this great change, southern Jiangsu 
needs to explore and study many prominent problems and use new 
methods to resolve them if it wants to push the economy onto a 
new stage and achieve new aims in its practice. 
  -- Seek a more effective form of realization for the 
public ownership and the collective economy. At present, 
the form of realization adopted by town and township enterprises 
under collective ownership in southern Jiangsu is primarily 
community ownership featuring "townships and villages, each 
owning what they run." Although it has apparent superiorities, 
this form of ownership still gives rise to various degrees of 
ambiguity in property rights relations. The joint-stock 
cooperation system, which is on trial practice in southern 
Jiangsu, can be described as a solution to this problem. 
Possessing the strong points of both the joint-stock system and 
the cooperation system, the joint-stock cooperation system is 
more suited to the characteristics of the town and township 
collective economy, which relies mainly on medium-sized and 
small enterprises. Efforts should be taken to put the system 
into trial use, and to spread correct and efficient methods 
among the users. Conscientious studies also should be carried 
out on relevant issues concerning the present implementation of 
the joint-stock cooperation system, the establishment of a 
modern enterprise system, and the cultivation of a new 
microeconomic foundation. 
  -- Uphold public ownership as the main body of the 
economy, and encourage and support other economic elements so as 
to attain common development. At present, the individual 
and private economies still occupy a relatively small proportion 
in some localities in southern Jiangsu. To solve this problem, 
positive measures should be drawn up to encourage the growth of 
nonpublic economies. In addition, studies need to carried out 
on how to encourage the common development of many other 
economic elements while ensuring the dominant position of the 
publicly owned economy. 
  -- Perfect the industrial structure and bring about 
coordination among different industries. Southern Jiangsu 
has more advanced secondary industries, yet its tertiary 
industries are at a level lower than the average levels of the 
country and the province, while its primary industries also are 
faced with the question of how to enhance themselves on a 
constant basis. Under such circumstances, strides should be 
taken to study and implement relevant measures as soon as 
possible so as to further readjust and perfect the economic and 
industrial structures according to the needs of the new 
situation, and to bring about well-coordinated development in 
primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. 
  -- Accelerate the pace of opening to the outside 
world, and vigorously enhance the level of foreign-oriented 
practices. The southern Jiangsu region has always attached 
great importance to and achieved real results in the aspect of 
opening to the outside world. Yet generally speaking, it still 
lags behind the Zhu Jiang Delta. The region should readjust its 
opening-up strategy, and should move from domestic markets to 
international markets, and from foreign-oriented practices to 
internationalized practices with great strides. Efforts should 
be made to make full use of the excellent opportunities brought 
about by the opening and development of the Pudong District, to 
formulate and implement an export-oriented economic development 
strategy in accordance with customary international practices, 
to set up large-scale enterprise groups and push them into the 
world market, and to take an active part in the international 
division of labor and in international cooperation. 
  -- Do better planning, reinforce ecological and 
environmental protection, and bring about healthy development in 
the urbanization of rural areas. While pushing forward 
with rapid economic development, the industrialization of rural 
areas in southern Jiangsu also has given rise to many problems 
that should not be overlooked. The most prominent among these 
are the irrational planning and pattern of urban construction, 
the excessive occupancy of already infertile farmland, and the 
adverse impact on ecology and environment. All these problems 
have aroused the attention of leaders and relevant departments 
in the southern Jiangsu region. We still need to make up our 
minds and exert great efforts to seek strategies and measures to 
solve these problems, so as to bring about healthy development 
in the industrialization and urbanization of rural areas, and to 
make the two supplement each other. 
  The arduous explorations carried out by the southern Jiangsu 
people over the past 10 years or more are yielding fruitful 
results, and the success of their practice is convincing. In 
the face of the new situation and the opportunities for future 
development, the cadres and masses of the southern Jiangsu 
region are greeting the trials of this era with a brand-new 
attitude. Surely they can constantly win new victories in 
reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive as 
long as they uphold the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, never 
waver in carrying out the party's basic line, emancipate their 
minds, seek truth from facts, carry out hard struggle, and have 
the courage to forge ahead and open up new paths. A new, 
socialist southern Jiangsu that enjoys "a prosperous economy, 
advanced science and education, a fairly comfortable life, sound 
social security, and civilized social practices" soon will 
present itself once again with a magnificent posture before the 
eyes of the people of the whole country!

Summary of an All-Army Seminar on the Theory of Building 
Socialism With Chinese Characteristics"] 
  [Text] Last year the National Defense University held an 
all-Army seminar on the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. Institutions, armed forces units, and 
military academies throughout the Army provided the seminar with 
several hundred theses. Authors of 85 good theses attended the 
seminar. The following is a summary of the seminar. 
<H3>  1. The Historic Position and Great Significance of the 
Theory of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics </H3>
  During discussions, the participants unanimously pointed out 
that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics upholds the combination of the basic 
theories of Marxism-Leninism with China's actual conditions and 
the characteristics of the era. This is a creative theory that 
has taken shape gradually and has developed into the great 
practice of China's reform, opening up, and modernization. This 
theory has inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong 
Thought and is a banner guiding China's modernization toward 
success. 
  On the inherent relations between the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and Mao Zedong Thought, 
some comrades pointed out: There were two historic leaps in the 
party's ideology and theory. The first was in the democratic 
revolutionary period, which saw the emergence of a revolutionary 
road with Chinese characteristics, unveiled the logic of the 
Chinese revolution, gave rise to Mao Zedong Thought, and guided 
the Chinese revolution to victory. The second took place after 
the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, 
during which the road to building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics was found, the logic of Chinese modernization 
was unveiled, and the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics took shape -- a theory that will lead China's 
modernization to success. The common points and inherent 
relations of the two leaps were "combined" and the theoretical 
essence of the two roads was emancipating the mind and seeking 
truth from facts, though the content, natures, and missions of 
the two leaps greatly differed from each other. In his 
remaining years, Comrade Mao Zedong tried to unveil the logic of 
Chinese modernization and made initial achievements in this 
respect, but because this historical mission was difficult and 
complicated, and because Comrade Mao Zedong committed a mistake 
of subjectivism -- a mistake of an ideological nature -- we can 
say that this historical mission basically remained incomplete. 
The second-generation leading collective of the party Central 
Committee with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core conscientiously 
studied and summed up the experiences and lessons since the 
founding of the PRC, and in their new practice established the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This 
theory carried forward and corrected Comrade Mao Zedong's 
explorations, while a more important point was putting forward 
and developing new ideas. 
  The participants pointed out: We should study and master the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
use this theory to guide our thinking and work, and this should 
permeate the entire process of socialist modernization. This is 
a matter of priority importance which involves the country's 
prosperity and prolonged stability. In new historical 
conditions, only by arming cadres and soldiers throughout the 
armed forces with this theory can we ensure absolute party 
leadership over the Army, ensure that the Army will adhere 
firmly to the party's basic line for 100 years, ensure that the 
nature of the people's Army will not change, and ensure the 
smooth carrying out of all construction and reform projects in 
the Army. 
<H3>  2. The Basic Content and Scientific Structure of the Theory 
of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics </H3>
  The participants said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a scientific 
system with rich and profound content, strict logic, and a 
complete structure. This system originated in 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, but bears the strong nature 
of creation, practice, and the era. It does not simply copy or 
fragmentarily supplement Marxism or its principles, but is a 
major development of Marxism and its principles. Both in form 
and content, it is a scientific system of modern Chinese Marxism 
with special characteristics. 
  We say that this theory is a scientific system because, like 
other scientific theories, it has the basic scope, basic 
viewpoints, basic theory, completeness, its own systematizm, and 
profoundness. Completeness means that the theory comprehensively 
explains a number of basic questions, such as what socialism is 
and how to build socialism in an economically and culturally 
backward country like China. Systematizm means that there are 
strict logical relations between these basic questions. 
Profoundness refers to its theoretical summation of a number of 
fundamental questions concerning socialism; it is a theoretical 
manifestation of modern Chinese socialist development law. 
  The participants were very much interested in discussing 
the scientific system of the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. They had this consensus view: The 
theory that socialism is in the initial period is the basis of 
this theoretical system. The productive forces criterion and 
the three favorable's are the main theme of this system. The 
socialist market economy is something newly developed by this 
system. Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts are 
the essence of this system. "One central task, two basic 
points" are the core and specific manifestation of this system. 
  The participants also unanimously pointed out: The 14th CPC 
National Congress report has summed up Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in 
nine points, and has comprehensively and systematically 
expounded the basic ideas and basic views of this theory. This 
is very important for us in thoroughly understanding this theory 
and its scientific system. The theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics is an organic scientific system 
comprising a series of viewpoints and principles. Only by 
completely and accurately studying and understanding it can we 
truly master its essence. 
<H3>  3. Seriously Studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Thought on 
Army Building in the New Period and Building the Army Into a 
Modernized, Regularized, and Revolutionary Army </H3>
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the general architect of China's 
reform, opening up, and modernization. He is also the general 
architect of Army building in the new period. Through 
discussions, the participants further understood that Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building in the new period has 
inherited the fundamental point of Mao Zedong's military 
thinking. On the other hand, this thought also has put forward 
a number of new viewpoints. One of its basic points is that the 
Chinese Army must focus on modernization; comprehensively carry 
out revolutionization, modernization, and regularization; build 
the Army into a fine army with Chinese characteristics; improve 
China's national defense capacity; and provide a powerful 
guarantee of safety for China's reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. Many participating comrades pointed out: We 
should study and implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on 
Army building in light of the actual conditions of our armed 
forces units, maintain a "firm grip" on the central task of 
modernization, and speed up our Army building and reform. 
Efforts should be made to improve the quality of our Army. 
Education and training should be put in a strategic position. 
Strict training should be given to the armed forces according 
to actual combat, so as to improve their combat effectiveness. 
  Comrades present at the seminar also profoundly discussed 
how 
to strengthen and improve the Army's ideological work under the 
conditions of the socialist market economy. Following the 
development of China's reform and opening up and the 
establishment of the socialist market economy structure, 
interest relations are being adjusted, causing a profound change 
in the concept of value, in standards of conduct, and in 
life-styles. Thus we are required to inherit and develop the 
Army's fine tradition of ideological and political work, to cope 
with the development of the era, and to strengthen and improve 
the Army's ideological and political work. It is necessary to 
correctly appraise the positive influence of the socialist 
market economy on officers' and soldiers' minds, to pay 
attention to this main aspect, and to turn disadvantages into 
advantages. It is necessary to propagate the "five kinds of 
spirit" initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character 
enterprising spirit" summed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, so 
as to encourage officers and soldiers to cultivate a correct 
concept of life, a correct concept of value, and the spirit of 
selfless dedication, and to resolutely resist money worship, 
pleasure seeking, and extreme individualism. It is necessary to 
meet the Army's demand for modernization, as well as the 
officers' and soldiers' demands for knowledge; to make 
ideological and political work permeate education and training; 
to improve the Army's scientific and cultural quality; and to 
strengthen its coherent force and combat effectiveness. We 
should be good at resolving ideological and actual problems; 
really care for cadres' and soldiers' study, training, work, and 
lives; and carry out profound, meticulous, and down-to-earth 
ideological and political work. In short, ideological and 
political work is the fine tradition and unique strong point of 
our Army. As long as we use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his thought 
on Army building to arm the minds of cadres and soldiers 
throughout the armed forces, work in a down-to-earth manner, 
make bold explorations, and are good at summing up experience, 
we will be able to blaze a new trail in the Army's ideological 
and political work, and in its modernization drive.

3768 2429), and Huang Caihong (7806 1752 5725)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- Central Military 
Commission [CMC] members Chi Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, 
and Fu Quanyou recently visited military units stationed in 
Beijing to extend Spring Festival greetings to the officers and 
men of ground, naval, and air forces. They expressed the hope 
that commanders and fighters will strengthen army building in an 
all-around way in line with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and his concept of army 
building in the new period, as well as the general requirements 
for army building set forth by Jiang Zemin. 
  Prior to visits by the commission members, Vice Chairmen Liu 
Huaqing and Zhang Zhen had already called on the first company 
of a unit under the Beijing Military Region to extend the CMC's 
Spring Festival greetings to all officers and men. 
  On the morning of 2 February, Chi Haotian, CMC member and 
defense minister, visited the Engineering Design Research 
Institutes of the Second Artillery Corps and the Commission for 
National Defense Science, Technology and Industry, where he 
listened to briefings and viewed the computer laboratory. While 
meeting scientific and technical personnel, Chi Haotian said: 
Chinese scientists and technicians have made great 
contributions to defense modernization. The explosion of the 
first atomic bomb and the launching of the first artificial 
satellite reflect, in a concentrated form, their widsom, hard 
work, and dedication. It is hoped that they will bring into 
play the pioneering, self-sacrificing spirit and make new 
contributions to China's reform, opening up, and economic 
development in the coming year. 
  On the morning of 3 February, Zhang Wannian, CMC member and 
chief of the General Staff, visited the Air Force Command Post, 
where he heard a briefing on their duties and extended greetings 
to officers and men in the electronic chart, communications, and 
radar offices. He said: Communications is the core for 
coordinating combined forces and commanding modernization. It 
is hoped that officers and men will constantly study and work 
hard to accelerate the development of the Army's communications 
undertaking. 
  On the morning of 4 February, Yu Yongbo, CMC member and 
director of the General Political Department, called on teachers 
and researchers of the Armored Force Engineering Academy and 
extended Spring Festival greetings to comrades of all military 
academies. After viewing the teaching and research office, the 
simulation training center, and the computer center, he thanked 
teachers and researchers for helping train large numbers of 
talented personnel needed for the Army's modernization. He 
exhorted them to step up efforts to improve the academy in line 
with Deng Xiaoping's demand for "gearing education to meeting 
the needs of modernization, the world, and the future." 
  On the afternoon of 4 February, Fu Quanyou, CMC member and 
director of the General Logistics Depaprtment, called on the 
Navy General Hospital to extend greetings to medical experts, 
professors, and health care personnel; as well as to comrades of 
all military hospitals. He urged them to continually improve 
health-care and service quality and turn the General Hospital 
into a first-rate hospital with political integrity, superb 
technique, advanced facilities, and scientific management. He 
visited the otolaryngological ward, inquired about patients' 
conditions, and wished them a happy New Year and early recovery. 
  The above leaders were accompanied by relevant officials on 
their visits to the units.

military units have conducted in-depth education on supporting 
the government and cherishing the people; actively promoted 
unity between the Army and the government, between the Army and 
the people, and among various nationalities; and fostered a 
peaceful and stable social environment north and south of Tian 
Shan. The vast numbers of officers and men have fully supported 
local economic construction, thereby promoting the autonomous 
region's economic development. Troops in the military region 
have contributed to defending and building border areas, and 
people of all nationalities in Xinjiang will never forget this. 
  On behalf of party committees and organs in the military 
region, Fu Bingyao extended Spring Festival greetings to cadres 
of all nationalities, workers, and staff members in the Xinjiang 
Production and Construction Corps. He stated: The production 
and construction corps is an important force in Xinjiang's 
defense and construction. As always, troops in the military 
region will support the work carried out by the corps, with whom 
they will jointly do a good job in Xinjiang's defense and 
construction. Jin Yunhui, deputy secretary of the autonomous 
regional party committee and commander of the production and 
construction corps, noted: In the new year, we will continue to

autonomous region.

  [Text] Officers and men of the Tibet Military Region, 
including those working in offices, have been engaged in field 
training activities since the new year. 
  Because of heavy snowfalls, most parts of the Tibet Plateau 
are very cold. To be prepared for future warfare [wei lai zhan 
zheng] and to train crack troops able to carry out all emergency 
missions under any weather conditions, the military district, 
after careful planning, notified all units in the district to 
immediately leave their barracks and train their troops in 
snow-capped areas to improve their combat effectiveness. 
  During the last 10 days of January, offices of the military 
district organized their civilian personnel, cooks, drivers, and 
other workers to take part in marches. In accordance with their 
geographical environments and natural conditions, units 
stationed in Lhasa, Shannan, Nyingchi, Xigaze, and Qamdo 
Prefectures trained their troops in areas where conditions were 
unfavorable. So far, over 85 percent of the units in Tibet have 
carried out their winter training assignments.

<F P=106> ["Provincial Party Committee and Government Hold Discussion </F>
Meeting With Military and Government Leaders; They Enjoy Their 
Harmonious Ties and Discuss Double-Support Programs"] 
  [Text] Yesterday morning, the Zhejiang Provincial Party 
Committee and Government held a Spring Festival discussion 
meeting with military and government leaders. Happily gathered 
in a hall were leaders of the provincial party committee, the 
provincial people's congress, the provincial government, the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] 
provincial committee, and the provincial party discipline 
inspection commission, as well as leaders of military and armed 
police units stationed in Zhejiang. They freely enjoyed the 
harmonious ties between the military and the masses and 
discussed general plans on further improving double-support 
programs under new circumstances. 
  Li Zemin, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
chaired the meeting. 
  Military and local leaders attending the meeting fully 
affirmed the accomplishments Zhejiang has made on double-support 
work in 1993. They pointed out: Various localities in Zhejiang 
have earnestly implemented the instructions and guidelines of 
the party Central Committee and the State Council on paying 
attention to and supporting military and local reform and 
construction projects. They have conscientiously involved 
themselves, have performed realistic tasks, and have actively 
helped military units resolve various problems, including 
fulfilling duties for combat-readiness, enhancing military 
training, raising production, and improving living conditions. 
Various relevant provincial departments have closely 
coordinated with one another and actively supported military 
units to enhance production and operations in an effort to 
effectively improve the placement of retired soldiers. 
Consequently, these efforts have considerably enhanced army 
building and have further consolidated and strengthened the 
unity between the military and the government and between the 
military and the masses. Attending comrades indicated: In 1994, 
we should strictly concentrate our energies on the overall task 
of economic construction, proceed from grass-roots units, pay 
attention to achieving realistic results, and actively join in 
Zhejiang's reform and opening-up undertakings. Meanwhile, we 
should continually and actively support army building and 
properly serve the military units. We should improve our 
campaigns, whereby military units and localities perform 
realistic tasks for one another, and whereby the military, the 
police, and the masses can develop jointly. 
  Li Zemin listened to attending comrades' speeches. Then, on 
behalf of the provincial party committee, the provincial 
people's congress standing committee, the provincial government, 
the provincial CPPCC committee, and the people of Zhejiang, he 
extended festive greetings and lofty respects to officers and 
men of military and armed police units stationed in Zhejiang. 
He said: In 1993, Zhejiang earnestly implemented the party's 
basic line, seized opportunities, deepened reform, and promoted 
development. Consequently, the province has maintained political 
and social stability, has enhnaced economic progress, and has 
contniually raised living standards. The overall situation has 
been good. Such results are inseparable from the effective 
support and help given by all the officers and men of military 
and armed police units stationed in Zhejiang. Besides executing 
their duties in safeguarding coastal and border defense in 1993, 
officers and men of military and armed police units stationed in 
Zhejiang also joined in protecting local social order and in 
waging anti-smuggling struggles, thereby maintaining social 
stability. The broad ranks of officers and men also 
enthusiastically participated in local key construction 
projects. They have, as always in the past, joined in 
emergency-rescue work and in providing disaster relief. 
Wherever there is a disaster, there will be the People's 
Liberation Army, which regards emergencies of the locality and 
the people as its own. Officers and men of military and armed 
police units stationed in Zhejiang have also joined in campaigns 
that facilitated "the joint development of the military, the 
police, and the masses" and have done a lot of work to enhance 
spiritual civilization drives in various localtities. He 
pointed out: While doing double-support work in 1994, Zhejiang 
must obey and serve the overall requirements for performing the 
whole party's work in accordance with the central authorities' 
instructions: We must "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, 
open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability." 
Additionally, we must regard developing grass-roots units, 
promoting education programs, and performing realistic tasks as 
our major work. We should pay attention to enhancing army 
building and living conditions of officers and soldiers so as to 
further foster the ties between the military and the government 
and between the military and the masses. Leaders at various 
levels should pay close attention to double-support work. They 
should intensify education programs among the broad ranks of 
cadres and people, stressing the importance of unity between the 
military and the government and between the military and the 
masses. Consequently, various double-support tasks can be 
earnestly carried out at the grass-roots units, and Zhejiang's 
double-support work can be raised to new heights. 
  Provincial party, military, and government leaders, as well 
as leaders of various military units stationed in Zhejiang, 
attended the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- Procedures for 
Implementing the "Provisions of the State Council on the Work 
Hours of Workers and Staff Members" (The Ministry of Labor and 
the Ministry of Personnel, 8 February 1994): 
  Article 1. These procedures are drawn up in accordance with 
the "Provisions of the State Council on the Work Hours of 
Workers and Staff Members." 
  Article 2. These procedures shall apply to workers and staff 
members in all organs, mass organizations, enterprises, and 
institutions (including enterprises under various single-mode or 
forms of mixed economic ownership such as state-owned, 
collectively owned, privately run, individually run, 
foreign-funded, and Chinese-foreign joint-funded enterprises, as 
well as mines, factories; construction, communications and 
transportation, logging, farming, and commercial organizations; 
service entities; scientific research and design, and cultural 
and sports organizations; and medical and public health 
services, institutes of higher learning, middle and elementary 
schools, and kindergartens) on the PRC's territory. 
  Article 3. While ensuring the completion of their production 
tasks and work without increasing personnel and spending, a 
system of work hours consisting of eight hours each day for a 
weekly average of 44 work hours shall be implemented among 
workers and staff members. 
  Article 4. All units shall implement the provisions step by 
step with plans and strengthen their management. They shall not

enterprises and institutions, local principal departments shall 
verify the need and shall submit reports to local labor and 
personnel departments for approval to shorten the work hours.

<F P=106> [Article by Macroeconomic Group of the CPPCC Economic </F>
Committee: "Judgment and Proposal Regarding Current 
Macroeconomics"] 
  [Text] China has achieved conspicuous achievements in its 
reform, opening up, and socialist construction over the past 
year, of which the successes in two aspects are especially 
appreciated by domestic and foreign media. 1) The marked 
progress made in the process of the economic market as a whole, 
and a major step has been or will be taken in reforming finance 
and taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade, state 
enterprises, and other essential fields in light of the 
"Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Questions 
Regarding Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy System," 
which indicates that China's reform has entered the stage of 
overall advance; 2) The resolute macroeconomic regulation and 
control measures, focused on economic means, adopted by the 
central government in late June, which quickly turned out 
positive results. If the central government had not adopted 
resolute measures at that time, the economy could not have been 
so stable, and reform, opening up, and development could not 
have turned out such major achievements. 
  Practice has proved that both giving full play to the role 
of 
the market mechanism, and strengthening and improving 
macroeconomic regulation and control are the essential and 
indispensable components of a market economy system. A view of 
the market economy system of all countries shows that its basic 
framework includes a perfect market system, as well as a 
macroeconomic regulation and control system. This also should 
be the case of a socialist market economy system. 
  One of the basic experiences of China's economic reform is 
to 
constantly promote economic development through gradual reforms, 
and to create conditions for further reform so that economic 
development and deepened reform will push each other forward. 
Practice has proved that the degree of market advance must 
correspond with the capacity of macroeconomic regulation and 
control. The faster the pace of market advance, the more 
effective the macroeconomic braking mechanism will have to be. 
The intense reform, rapid economic growth, and readjustment of 
the interests structure and economic relations are bound to be 
followed by more contradictions and frictions, resulting in all 
kinds of unexpected outcomes. The task of macroeconomic 
regulation and control is to discover the new contradictions and 
problems promptly, and to adopt measures to resolve them. When 
such "microscopic regulation" is introduced frequently, it will 
avoid further aggravation of the problems and contradictions. 
As the extent of "microscopic regulation" is limited, the shock 
and loss incurred also will be relatively limited. If the 
problems are not discovered and resolved promptly by immediately 
adopting the method of "microscopic regulation," but are left 
until they pile up and reach an extent that must be resolved, 
the scope of regulation and control inevitably will be broad. 
We then will be forced to slam on the brakes. Consequently, 
the shock and loss incurred will be greater. Therefore, the 
prediction of macroeconomic regulation and control is 
particularly important. It is necessary to take precautions 
against problems that might crop up in every stage of reform and 
development, including problems related to stagflation, and to 
adopt effective means and measures to prevent and resolve them 
promptly. Under the conditions of developing a socialist market 
economy, macroeconomic regulation and control should be focused 
on economic means, which include interest rates, tax rates, and 
other means of indirect control. However, the necessary 
administrative means must not be forsaken. At a time when 
change is being effected in the economic system, the problems 
arising from the administrative behavior of the government 
departments at all levels should be resolved by adopting 
necessary administrative means. The Decision of the CPC Central 
Committee on Economic Structural Reform has defined clearly that 
the powers and responsibilities of macroeconomic regulation and 
control lie with the center because only the central authorities 
can make overall judgments and decisions on such issues as the 
nationwide supply of currency. In this regard, the localities 
should be subordinate to the center, and the part should be 
subordinate to the whole -- not vice versa. 
  Under the favorable domestic and international environment, 
China's economic growth must be rapid and not slow. However, we 
should take note of economic stability and coordinated 
development. It should be noted that the greatest danger of high 
economic growth is inflation. Hence, there should be a limit to 
the high growth, which should not lead to serious inflation or 
social instability. If there is inflation, it will be impossible 
for rapid economic growth to continue. We must be aware that 
the danger of aggravated inflation still exists. The 1993 
retail price index rose by around 13 percent over that in 1992, 
and there is still great pressure on 1994 prices. Curbing 
inflation now has become a matter of concern for people at home 
and abroad. It is also an important condition for ensuring 
social stability and the smooth progress of reform and opening 
up. Excessive investment is the main factor triggering 
inflation. The great demand for investment, which exceeds the 
national strength, must be backed by the excessive issuance of 
currency, which will stimulate inflation. Fixed-asset 
investment in 1993 rose by around 47 percent over 1992, of which 
investment by state units rose 58 percent, the largest scale of 
investment in the 1980's. All localities now have great demand 
for investment and for developing new projects. Unless 
effective measures are adopted to check this trend, the 1994 
scale of fixed-asset investment will continue to increase, which 
will further aggravate inflation. To curb excessive growth in 
fixed-asset investment, it is necessary to adopt correct 
monetary policies, have the currency supply under control, issue 
currency as little as possible, and strictly approve the loans 
granted for fixed-asset investment. We have learned the lesson 
of fluctuations on several occasions in the past. To avoid 
drastic falls, it is necessary first to guard against great 
rises. We must avoid another overheated economy, which may 
force us to adopt stern measures. Work in all fields should be 
focused on optimizing the structure and increasing efficiency, 
rather than on one-sidedly pursuing growth in output value and 
blindly expanding the scale of construction. In the new year, 
we must pay special attention to agriculture, and under no 
circumstances should we develop secondary and tertiary 
industries at the expense of agriculture. 
  Experience tells us that deepened reform requires a spacious 
environment. To attain this point, the scale of economic growth 
and investment should be appropriate. The economy will continue 
to grow at a rapid pace in 1994, and so will the total 
investment in construction. This is definite, but 
appropriateness is very important. Only by setting the growth 
at a practical level and keeping investment growth strictly 
under control can we ensure that the entire economic environment 
will not be too tight and that all reforms will proceed 
profoundly. When a good job is done in reform, the established 
stimulative and restraining mechanisms will promote the 
optimization of resources, reduce losses, and genuinely attain 
the objective of better efficiency and intensive operation. 
  In the 1990's and in the entire process of attaining the 
socialist modernization program, we must handle properly the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability. Reform 
is the motive force, while development is the target and 
stability is the premise. Only by doing a good job in reform 
and development can there be a solid foundation for stability. 
Without a stable political and social environment, however, it 
will be difficult for reform and development to proceed. For 
this reason, we should take social bearing capacity and 
stability into account, while proceeding with reform and 
development. Reform must promote development, while the latter 
must meet the needs of the former. 
  The target for 1994 national economic and social 
development, 
which is both grand and feasible, has been proposed. In the 
1994 and throughout the 1990's, it will be remarkable to attain 
the annual average GNP growth of 8 to 9 percent set out by the 
14th CPC Congress. The task of macroeconomic regulation and 
control is to attain this goal, and to ensure the rapid, steady, 
and coordinated [kuai su wen ding xie tiao 1816 6643 4489 1353 
0588 6148] development of the national economy. This is what 
the people of the whole country are expecting.

  [Text] Beijing, February 14 (CNS)--According to 
predictions by relevant departments under the State Council, the 
income of urban residents in the country will continue to grow 
in coming years with their capita income for living expenses in 
1995 expected to be RMB 2,933 [renminbi], up from RMB 2,225 in 
1993, an increase of 21.86 percent over that in 1992 while the 
growth of their living expenses will remain lower than the 
growth of their income by one to three percent. 
  According to these predictions, there are several factors 
accounting for their growth of income. First, with the reform 
for enterprises having been carried on in an intensive way, the 
economic efficiency of enterprises will continue to rise and the 
income of staff and workers will undoubtedly increase. In 1993 
alone, the gross amount of wages for both staff and workers in 
the country in 1993 increased by 22.6 percent over that in 1992. 
  Second, with implementation of the scheme aimed at 
increasing 
wages for civil servants in government organs, payment to people 
working in enterprises and institutions will also increase, 
resulting in the growth of income. 
  Third, with the gradual improvement of the securities 
markets 
in the country, residents investing in stocks and bonds will 
keep increasing and their income from this sector will increase. 
  Fourth, people with a second job are increasing with their 
income earned from this additional source rapidly increasing. 
For this reason, the per capita income of urban residents for 
their living expenses will be up to RMB 2,577 in 1994 and RMB 
2,933 in 1995, respective increases of 15.3 percent and 13.8 
percent while the growth of their spending for living will be 
13.58 percent and 12.41 percent respectively in these two years, 
lower than the growth of income by one to three percentage 
points.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Feb (XINHUA) -- It is not easy to count 
every change in Chinese peasants' lives since reform was 
launched. Although it has only been 15 years, it is 15 years of 
earthshaking changes. 
  Though the Chinese are world famous for their cuisine, 
Chinese peasants had not been able to stuff themselves with food 
until the last dozen of years or so during which the household 
contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to 
output was practiced. Here are two peasant "food lists": one 
for 1978, in which Chinese peasants' per capita consumption of 
grain was 247.8 kg, vegetables -- 141.5 kg, meat -- 5.75 kg, 
eggs -- 0.79 kg, and fish and prawns -- 0.84 kg; the other for 
1992, in which per capita consumption of grain, vegetable, meat, 
egg, fish and prawn were 250 kg, 129 kg, 11.83 kg, 2.85 kg, and 
2.25 kg, respectively. This has fully shown the improvement in 
peasants' diet structure. 
  In terms of calorie and protein criteria, which are a common 
practice in the world, the amount of energy taken in by Chinese 
peasants has risen above the average for developing countries 
and is close to the 2,630-kilocalorie [da ka 1129 0595] mark of 
the world average. However, their quantity of energy and 
protein taken from animal food is equal to those of the world's 
low-income countries. This means that their diet structure still 
awaits further improvement. 
  We cannot ignore drinking water when talking about food. In 
1980, 500 million people in the nation's rural areas were 
drinking water not meeting hygienic standards; among which, 150 
million people drank contaminated ground water, 60 million of 
them drank bitter and salt water, and 45 million of them drank 
water containing high levels of fluorine. Fifteen years after 
the inception of reform and opening up, the state, collectives, 
and individuals have worked together and invested an 
accumulation of 13.3 billion yuan (over 70 percent from 
peasants) to build 330,000 waterworks around the country, and 
one-third of the peasants now have access to tap water. 
  Despite the fact that millions of people in old liberated, 
minority, border, and poor areas still need donated clothing 
from other areas to pass the winter, an overwhelming majority of 
peasants have resolved the clothing problem once and for all and 
are beginning to set higher standards for their dress. 
  Presently, over 98 percent of peasants buy their clothes 
from 
markets. Those hand-woven cloths and hand-made printed calicos 
of peasants, which used to be their articles of daily use, have 
turned into valuable handicrafts because of their scarcity and 
are found in stores. 
  With large and medium-sized cities as the centers, urban 
residents' ideas about buying clothes are beginning to spread to 
rural areas. A peasant in a Western suit is no longer something 
new; the clothing and temperaments of those middle-age and young 
peasants, who spend a long time at work and in business, are no 
difference from those of urban citizens. 
  If we term the dress of peasants in villages of Guangdong, 
Shanghai, and Beijing as a "suburban effect," the life of 
Tibetans in the grasslands in western Sichuan should be more 
convincing. On this great grassland, young Tibetans who become 
prosperous from running businesses turn their fortunes into 
clothes and ornaments they wear according to ethnic customs; it 
is nothing new for young girls and boys to wear clothes or 
ornaments worth over 10,000 yuan. 
  Speaking about the things they use, peasants' "dreams" were 
limited before 1978 -- nothing but watches, bicycles, sewing 
machines, and radios, or the so-called "three things that turn 
and one thing that makes noise." Not many of them could turn 
their dreams into reality then. Now that the "three things that 
turn and one thing that makes noise" are within reach, they are 
now called the "four old objects." Presently, every peasant 
household has more than two watches or clocks and more than one 
bicycle, whereas every two households have one sewing machine 
and one radio around the country on average. 
  At the moment, the "seven new objects" have come into vogue 
in rural areas; they are: televisions, electric fans, 
videocassette recorders, refrigerators, washing machines, 
cameras, and motorcycles. Over 60 percent of peasant households 
around the country own televisions and electric fans; over 20 
percent of them have videocassette recorders, whereas 
motorcycles, refrigerators, washing machines, and cameras are 
becoming prevalent in villages in economically developed areas. 
  As living standards are rising as a whole, peasants are more 
and more willing to spend their money on cultural activities. 
Acquiring literacy and scientific knowledge are becoming 
conscious pursuits for peasants. In 1983, there was the news 
that a peasant in Beijing's suburbs bought a piano. In 1984, 50 
peasants in Hebei organized a tour to Japan at their own 
expense. This year, a resort for peasants appeared in Guangdong 
and some peasants used their money to buy automobiles, renovate 
airports, and run postal agencies. Every piece of such news is 
exciting. The peasants' world is becoming wider and their lives 
richer.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Securities 
Administrative Commission under the State Council and the China 
Securities Supervision Council held a joint news conference here 
today. Ma Zhongzhi, deputy director of the Securities 
Administrative Commission's General Office and the relevant 
persons in charge of the China Securities Supervision Council, 
respectively, spoke in connection with stock markets and some 
related policies in 1994. 
  Ma Zhongzhi said: With the approval of the State Council, 
China will issue 5.5 billion worth of renminbi stocks this year, 
roughly the same amount as last year after readjustment. This 
amount has been determined after taking full account of the 
financial capabilities of this year's stock markets. Ma 
Zhongzhi said: In issuing stocks in 1994, the method of 
controlling the total supply and demand and the method of quota 
administration will still be adopted. At present, the total 
amount of stock has been determined, but the stocks have not 
been distributed to localities and departments. In view of the 
reality that the issuing of stock in 1993 was carried out 
largely after August and that some enterprises have postponed 
their issuing of stock to this year, in issuing stock this year 
it is necessary to take into full account the financial 
capabilities of the market. At the same time, it is necessary 
to improve the work of reexamining the issuing of stock, enforce 
the examination and approval system strictly, and through the 
reexamination process, safeguard the state's industrial policies 
and the quality of companies whose stocks are listed. 
  Turning to the listing of state stocks and corporate stocks, 
Ma Zhongzhi said: The majority of enterprises in China which 
have switched to the shareholding system have been state-owned 
enterprises. In this process, stocks have been divided into 
state stocks, corporate stocks, individual stocks, and foreign 
stocks according to the actual conditions and needs of the time. 
Both state stocks and corporate stocks, being ordinary stocks, 
should share profits on an equal basis. Currently, however, 
only individual stocks and a small amount of corporate stocks 
are listed on the stock market, while state stocks have not yet 
been listed. Ma Zhongzhi pointed out: In the long run, this 
problem must be solved. However, in actual operations, many 
problems still remain in the listing of corporate stocks, 
because of the lack of good, feasible laws and regulations. Ma 
Zhongzhi said: The State Council has ordered the State Economic 
Restructuring Commission and its Securities Administrative 
Commission to step up the drawing up of relevant laws and 
regulations on the basis of summing up past experimentation 
experiences, to expand experiments in this field after the 
relevant laws and regulations are approved by the State Council, 
and for the time being, to temporarily suspend the examination 
and approval of applications for the listing of new corporate 
stocks. Ma Zhongzhi stressed: Even if measures for 
administering the listing of corporate stocks are promulgated, 
it will be impossible to list all at once all corporate stocks, 
which have accumulated over the years. The listing of corporate 
stocks should be solved step by step while taking into account 
the financial and technical capabilities of the market. Because 
the listing of state stocks is facing an even greater number of 
problems, it will be impossible to list them ahead of corporate 
stocks. He stressed: The listing of state stocks requires a 
process. 
  Turning to the problem of issuing renminbi stocks 
domestically by enterprises whose stocks have been listed 
outside the national boundaries, Ma Zhongzhi said: Last year, 
the stocks of six Chinese enterprises were successfully listed 
in Hong Kong, which attracted the attention of financial and 
press circles the world over. The move opened up a new path for 
China to attract foreign capital and also helped to speed up the 
linking of China's securities markets with the world market as 
quickly as possible. In accordance with the instructions of the 
leadership of the State Council, a relevant department of state 
has decided that 22 enterprises will have their stocks listed 
outside of China this year. Ma Zhongzhi said: Each of these 
enterprises will be transformed according to a standardized 
shareholding system and audited according to international 
practices. After that, their stocks will be listed when 
conditions are ripe. Their stocks will be listed mainly in Hong 
Kong, but a small number of them may list their stocks in the 
securities markets of the United States and other countries. Ma 
Zhongzhi noted: Taking into consideration the fact that the 
amount of stocks to be issued this year must be kept within 5.5 
billion yuan, that enterprises which are going to list their 
stocks outside China are all state-owned enterprises, and that 
the amount will be too large if these enterprises are to issue 
A-type stocks, the Securities Administrative Commission under 
the State Council has decided that these enterprises will not 
issue A-type stocks for the time being and that even if they 
want to issue A-type stocks, they must keep the amount under 5.5 
billion yuan. 
  Turning to the administration of stocks for internal staff 
and workers issued by shareholding limited companies whose funds 
are raised directly, Ma Zhongzhi said: At present, in issuing 
stocks for internal staff and workers, some of these companies 
have exceeded the proportion and limits, have made public 
internal stocks, and have individualized corporate stocks, all 
of which run counter to the original purpose of setting up such 
companies. Therefore, the State Council recently issued a 
circular explicitly banning various areas from engaging in the 
high-interest-rate collection of funds in the name of carrying 
out experiments on the internal shareholding system. The State 
Council has also asked the State Economic Restructuring 
Commission to cooperate with the State Economics and Trade 
Commission and the State Planning Commission to accelerate the 
enactment of standard measures for administering enterprises' 
issuing of internal stocks for staff and workers. Ma Zhongzhi 
said: Before the new measures are promulgated, the state will 
temporarily suspend the examination, approval, and issuing of 
stocks for internal staff and workers. To deal with enterprises 
which violate these measures, the state will not reexamine their 
applications to issue stocks, and still less, to permit their 
stocks to be listed. 
  At the news conference, the persons in charge of the China 
Securities Supervision Council told reporters about the illegal 
activities of the Shanghai securities office of the Xiangfan 
Trust and Investment Company under the Agricultural Bank of 
China in the course of serving as an agent for dealing in the 
stocks of an enterprise in Shanghai and the decision taken to 
punish the violator.

  [Text] In order to rejoin the GATT as soon as possible and 
to restore China's status as a signatory to the GATT, Beijing 
once again has urged provinces to stop randomly giving 
preferential treatment to foreign businessmen in the areas of 
trade, investment, and taxation. A ranking government official 
in Beijing said that this year, work will be done to standardize 
trading policies for same industries in different parts of the 
whole country. He also disclosed that China will change some 
special economic zones [SEZs] into internationally recognized 
free trade zones. 
  Over the past few years, the central government in Beijing 
differed from provincial authorities in foreign trade and 
investment policies, resulting in the withdrawal from China of 
some foreign investors who did not like the ambiguous policies; 
on the other hand, some foreign businessmen reaped huge profits 
from the special and preferential policies granted to them by 
local government departments. The official, who asked to remain 
anonymous, said he did not want to see either such situation 
happening in China. 
  China hopes to restore its status as a signatory to GATT in 
1995, so it is an urgent duty this year to standardize the 
trading policies for the same industries in different parts of 
the whole country. 
  The official disclosed that China will change some SEZs into 
free trade zones, which are acceptable to the international 
community, so that they can be recognized internationally. The 
official pointed out that except in the free trade zones, 
foreign businessmen will enjoy equal treatment when engaging in 
a same industry in any other parts of China. 
  The new policy will benefit the vast interior. In recent 
years, the interior lagged far behind the coastal region in 
attracting foreign capital. 
  By the end of 1993, 120 countries and regions had invested 
in 
China, and the investments went mainly into energy, light 
industry, electronic industry, mechanical spinning and weaving, 
clothing, metallurgical industry, construction materials, and 
real estate.

<F P=106> [By Li Hong: "Planners in Plea To Curb Chaotic City </F>
Development"] 
  [Text] Environmental experts and government officials have 
called for better city planning as highrises mushroom in the 
country's continuing construction boom. 
  They said layout and development programmes for big and 
medium-sized cities must first be approved by the central 
government, the State Council. 
  Construction Minister Hou Jie warned a recent urban planning 
conference in Beijing that continued unplanned development could 
have disastrous consequences on Chinese urban development. 
  And Construction Vice-Minister Zhou Gangzhi said several 
problems already existed despite the improvements brought about 
by the rapid construction. 
  Living conditions in some cities have deteriorated, he 
noted. 
  Buildings have been put up on precious greenbelt land and 
valuable historic or cultural relics were damaged or destroyed. 
  Traffic has also become more congested as roads have been 
taken over by sprawling markets or large buildings, experts said. 
  They said large cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin 
had done a better job of sticking to their urban layout 
programme as they built up their infrastructures. 
  Ten-year development schemes covering Beijing and Qingdao, 
on 
the Shandong coast in East China, beyond the year 2000 were 
recently approved by the central government. 
  Many other cities are now busily drawing up their own plans 
with State Council guidance, said Zhou. 
  However, the real estate boom which began in 1992 has sent 
construction racing ahead of planning in many cities, creating 
havoc in their development, Zhou added. 
  For example, the municipal government in Haikou, capital of 
Hainan Province, has been receiving several development 
applications a day. 
  And in 1992, the city's development projects covered a 
record 
6.25 million square metres. 
  As a result, demand for water and electricity doubled in a 
year, creating daily power and water cuts, Zhou said. There 
were also more traffic jams. 
  Another ministry official, Chen Xiaoli, said some local 
governments have tried to lure foreign investment at the expense 
of urban planning. 
  Greenbelt and cultural sites disappeared to make way for 
luxury hotels, commercial plazas, and entertainment centres. 
  In Hefei, capital of Anhui Province, developers built 
residential houses on the city's 5-kilometre-long round 
greenbelt. 
  The city government in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, remains 
"hesitant" about allowing hotels to be built around the city's 
renowned West Lake, Chen said. 
  Applications have been pouring in for development rights but 
most Hangzhou residents and environmentalists are against 
anything which will destroy the landscape. 
  However, some municipal officials are reluctant to give up a 
"magnet for foreign investment" and profits for the city 
government, Chen said. 
  Chen said the ministry has received another complaint from 
Wuhan City Planning Department. 
  A developer there is set to build a huge commercial 
entertainment park on top of Guishan Mountain, Wuhan's "green 
pearl," Chen said. The project has not been approved by the city 
planning department. 
  The case will face ministry investigation, Chen added.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yi (0702 0308): "Give Full Play to the Role of </F>
Import, Export Trade Fairs While Developing the Socialist Market 
Economy"] 
  [Text] The seven chambers of commerce of importers and 
exporters that have sprung up along with the tide of reform and 
opening up: The China Chamber of Commerce of Importers and 
Exporters of Metals, Minerals and Chemical Products; the China 
Chamber of Commerce of Importers and Exporters of Machinery and 
Electrical Products; the China Chamber of Commerce of Importers 
and Exporters of Medicines and Health Products; the China 
Chamber of Commerce of Importers and Exporters of Textiles; the 
China Chamber of Commerce of Importers and Exporters of Light 
Industrial Products and Arts and Crafts; the China Chamber of 
Commerce of Importers and Exporters of Foodstuffs, Native 
Produce, and Animal By-products; and the China Chamber of 
Commerce of Foreign Contractors (hereinafter referred to as the 
"Chamber of Commerce") have been established for 5 years. On 
the occasion of the celebration of the fifth anniversary, it is 
necessary to earnestly sum up the working experience of the 
Chamber of Commerce, to further understand the nature, status, 
and role of the Chamber of Commerce in a socialist market 
economy, and to make clear the working task of the Chamber of 
Commerce both in the present and in the future. 
<H5>  I. </H5>
  The Chamber of Commerce is the inevitable outcome of our 
foreign economic and trade system reform. The progress of 
economic system reform in our country since 1978 has made a 
series of reforms on the original foreign economic and trade 
management system characteristic of the unified and centralized 
operation and the unified responsibility of the state for both 
profits and loses, and the two major reforms in 1988 in 
particular have brought about fundamental changes to the foreign 
economic and trade system. According to the requirement of new 
system operations, the competent authorities of the government 
will be responsible neither for the direct control of business 
activities nor for macroeconomic management. Instead, they will 
apply economic, legal, and policy instruments as well as 
necessary administrative means to exercise macroeconomic 
regulation and supervision on foreign economic and trade work. 
Enterprises are no longer an appendage to the government, they 
guide themselves with market changes and carry out business 
activities independently in light of the value. Nevertheless, 
in the course of economic reform, many new problems have 
occurred as the administrative restriction of the competent 
authorities of the government is weakened and the decisionmaking 
power of enterprises is strengthened and a large number of new 
foreign economic and trade enterprises came into existence. For 
instance, some enterprises competed with each other blindly, 
exporting at a lower price and importing at a higher price, 
resulting in commodity "war" here and there. Some enterprises 
sold adulterated and low-quality commodities, forged business 
licenses, infringed patent rights, and registered trade marks, 
or even smuggled and evaded taxes. They violated the laws or 
norms of administrative disciplines. "You have your policies, 
they have their counter-measures." 
  Facts have shown that liberalized business activities are by 
no means activities without any rule, and autonomous business 
activities are by no means the free activities without any 
restriction. Under the condition of liberalized business 
activities, the management, organization and coordination need 
to be further strengthened. Therefore, we must find a new type 
of management and managing organization which is not only in 
conformity with the development of the socialist market economy 
and helpful for the competent authorities of the government in 
carrying out macroeconomic control, but also able to standardize 
effectively the business activities of the foreign economic and 
trade enterprises and ready to provide service for these 
enterprises. The Chamber of Commerce is just such a new type of 
organization. 
  The Chamber of Commerce has served as a connecting link 
between the competent authorities of the government and the 
foreign economic and trade enterprises, providing horizontal 
coordinating services for many of the foreign economic and trade 
enterprises. While the competent authorities of the government 
are reducing their administrative interference in this region, 
the Chamber of Commerce will help to implement the government's 
macroeconomic intention and policy among foreign economic and 
trade enterprises, coordinate their business activities with 
nonadministrative means, exercise -- with the trust of the 
competent authorities of the government -- part of the 
management functions which are inconvenient or no longer easy to 
exercise, and assist the government authorities in providing 
various kinds of necessary services for enterprises. The 
Chamber of Commerce, as the mediator between the government 
authorities and the enterprises, will provide a synthetic 
linkage between the macroeconomic management function of the 
government and the operational function of the enterprises. The 
macroeconomic regulation and control of the government will be 
changed into the professional intention in the form of joint 
pledges such as the professional etiquette and public contract 
through consultation and democratic decision within the Chamber 
of Commerce and carried out effectively among the foreign 
economic and trade enterprises. 
  The diversified business activities of the foreign economic 
and trade enterprises will be corrected and regulated and put 
into healthy development by the Chamber of Commerce through 
self-management, self-restraint, and dual control of the 
enterprises. The purpose of the Chamber of Commerce function in 
coordination and service is to consolidate macroeconomic 
regulation and control and to ensure the healthy development of 
the microeconomic activities among the enterprises -- a positive 
role that the government departments or other economic 
organizations are unable to play. Facts have proven that the 
Chamber of Commerce is a new type of coordination and service 
organization which has come into being with the demand of 
economic reform and played an important role in the promotion 
and development of economic reform. 
<H5>  II. </H5>
  Under the concern of the party Central Committee and the 
State Council and with the support of the relevant departments, 
local governments, and foreign economic and trade enterprises, 
the Chamber of Commerce has achieved remarkable success since 
its founding with coordination and service as its main purposes. 
  1. To strengthen the coordination and management for export 
commodities. In accordance with relevant state policies and the 
demand of domestic and international markets, the Chamber of 
Commerce has laid stress on the coordination and management of 
the bulk export commodities, which are poorly managed in 
business activities. In the last five years 87 sets of 
coordination and management regulations on single products have 
been formulated and implemented by the Chamber of Commerce after 
the approval of the competent authorities of foreign economic 
and trade organizations. In the meanwhile, the Chamber of 
Commerce formulated price plans for 400 different kinds of 
commodities according to the situation of international market 
and based on the study together with the member organizations, 
thus providing the price base for transaction and management of 
some major sensitive export commodities. Entrusted by the 
competent authority of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation, some members of the Chamber of Commerce 
has also tried to coordinate the import of some commodities. 
  2. To investigate thoroughly the unfair trade practice and 
regulate foreign trade order. In accordance with the 
requirement of the competent authorities of the government and 
in view of the negative factors occurring in our foreign trade 
activities in recent years, we have launched the campaign of 
regulating foreign trade order and rectifying unfair trade 
practices. The Chamber of Commerce has sent teams to carry out 
deep investigations in the major place of origin and the 
principal place of business with the finding that some 
enterprises were competing with each other blindly, purchasing 
at a higher price and selling at a lower price, engaging in 
business activities that were not within their business scope or 
out of their planned targets or even employing trickery in 
falsely claiming as their own business license, in smuggling and 
in evading taxes. The investigation teams made timely reports 
to government authorities at all levels and forwarded their own 
opinions on the treatment, and thus rectified promptly the 
unfair trade practice. 
  3. To organize the defense in antidumping cases. In recent 
years, with the intensification of trade protectionism all over 
the world, antidumping cases against China have occurred 
repeatedly. In order to safeguard the legitimate rights and 
interests of our export enterprises and consolidate the external 
selling market for our export commodities, the Chamber of 
Commerce, in the spirit of "active defense and unyielding 
struggle," has organized relevant organizations to participate 
in the defense in antidumping cases against our export 
commodities. In the last five years the chamber of Commerce has 
taken up nearly 50 antidumping cases and retrieved a loss of 
about several hundred million yuan, having safeguarded the 
interests of the nation and export enterprises, as well as the 
credit of our export commodities in the international market. 
  4. To broaden contact and exchange with the outside world. 
From its founding the Chamber of Commerce has made consistent 
efforts in promoting the trade exchange and economic cooperation 
between China and other countries all over the world. The 
Chamber of Commerce has so far organized 693 enterprises to 
participate in 69 exhibits in 58 countries or regions with total 
deals reaching $100 million. The Chamber of Commerce has also 
organized 26 marketing or research teams going abroad to assist 
member organizations in understanding and developing a market. 
The Chamber of Commerce has established contact with 95 
economic and trade organizations in 69 countries with friendly 
intercourse and cooperation. The Chamber of Commerce has now 
become the bridge to bring together the commercial circles both 
at home and abroad. 
  5. To provide consultation and information service. The 
Chamber of Commerce has now established the consultation and 
information service department and maintained constant business 
contacts with many of the economic and trade information 
organizations both at home and abroad. The Chamber of Commerce 
has also formed its own information service team and an import 
and export information network has gradually come into being. 
The Chamber of Commerce has edited and published large numbers 
of books, periodicals, and other publications concerning foreign 
economic cooperation and trade. It is now preparing to 
establish the computerized information network, using an 
advanced information transmission system to provide enterprises 
with updated and practical information and to provide the 
consultation services as requested by the enterprises from time 
to time. Some other members of the Chamber of Commerce also 
provide external services for enterprises through their 
cooperation with the consultation and information service 
corporations in foreign countries. 
  While providing an active service for our economic reform 
and 
opening up, the Chamber of Commerce has matured and developed. 
In the last five years the function and business scope of the 
Chamber and Commerce have been expanded, its coordination method 
has been gradually consolidated, its operating mechanism 
optimized, and its organization structure further improved. The 
Chamber of Commerce has so far established 63 commodity branches 
with more than 3000 members all over the country, thus forming a 
broad link in business contact and working network domestically 
and internationally. The Chamber of Commerce, as an essential 
force in the development of foreign economic cooperation and 
trade, has preliminarily become a national chamber of commerce 
with Chinese characteristics. 
<H5>  III. </H5>
  The Chamber of Commerce has never stopped studying, 
practicing, and developing. We can say that the Chamber of 
Commerce is now getting more and more mature in the course of 
economic reform and opening up. However, it is still a newly 
emerging phenomena in our country as compared with the chambers 
of commerce with a history of hundreds of years in those Western 
countries with highly developed market economies. The 14th 
National Congress of the Communist Party of China has defined as 
the reform target the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure. Under the new situation of accelerating 
reform, opening to the outside world, and development of the 
socialist market economy, the Chamber of Commerce is now 
assuming heavy responsibilities. Here, with regard to how to 
enhance the construction of the Chamber of Commerce and how to 
do a better job in the Chamber of Commerce, I would like to air 
some opinions of my own: 
  1. To have a clearer understanding of the nature, position, 
function, and role of the Chamber of Commerce. 
  What is the nature and position of the Chamber of Commerce? 
The Chamber of Commerce is not only an organization for 
coordination under the leadership of the competent authority of 
the government, but also an organization of self-management and 
self-service which was founded by the fellow-trade enterprises 
according to the requirements of their own development. On the 
one hand, the Chamber of Commerce will play the function of 
coordination and management on behalf of state interests in 
accordance with the authorization of the relevant government 
department. On the other, it will serve enterprises on behalf 
of enterprises to reflect their interests. Therefore, according 
to the present and real situation in our country, I believe that 
the Chamber of Commerce has a "dual role" to play: It 
represents not only the interests of the state, but also the 
interests of the enterprises. It serves as a link or bridge to 
connect the two sides. The Chamber of Commerce is neither a 
administrative organ in disguise, nor a nongovernmental 
organization in the general sense. It is an organization 
between the two, having a peculiar nature and a unique position. 
  In the countries with highly developed market economies, the 
chambers of commerce or similar organizations are occupying a 
very important position in national economic activities, as is 
the Chamber of Commerce in the foreign economic cooperation and 
trade operational structure. Generally speaking, under the 
market economy, the operational structure of national economy 
can be divided into several layers: Enterprises are the most 
basic layer, the layer for microeconomic activities, above which 
is the layer for macroeconomic management, the government. The 
Chamber of Commerce is in the middle of the two layers, serving 
as the link or bridge between the government and the 
enterprises. Working together, the three layers have formed the 
whole framework of our new foreign economic and trade system. 
  What is the function and role of the Chamber of Commerce? 
The most fundamental function and role for the Chamber of 
Commerce is to provide coordinating services. In more concrete 
terms, it involves the following three major aspects: First, 
the function and role of service is to establish the socialized 
service system, provide enterprises with high-quality services 
concerning policy, information, laws, consultation, public 
relations, etc., and help enterprises learn how to "swim in the 
ocean of market economy." Second, the function and role of 
coordination, in accordance with the government policies, laws 
and regulations, to coordinate enterprises in their productive 
and economic activities, maintain a normal productive and 
operational order and safeguard the interests of the state, the 
economic and trade sector, and the enterprises. Lastly, the 
function and role of linkage, that is, to provide a link between 
the government and the enterprises, carry out government 
intention among the enterprises and, at the same time, report to 
the government the demands and proposals of the enterprises. Of 
the three, the function and role of service is the most 
important. 
  Heavy and important tasks have been placed on the Chamber of 
Commerce in the work of foreign economic cooperation and trade. 
These tasks are mainly as follows: To study the principles, 
policies, strategies, and plans in expanding the line import and 
export of commodities and foreign technological and economic 
cooperation and to put forward proposals to the competent 
authorities; to carry out the macroeconomic intentions, 
policies, laws and regulations of the government among the 
enterprises and to report to the competent authorities the 
proposals and demands of enterprises; according to the 
development and changes of domestic and foreign markets, to 
coordinate among trade organizations the price, market, and 
client of import and export commodities; with the authorization 
of government authorities, to make suggestions, upon preliminary 
examination, concerning the allocation of export quotas and the 
issuance of export licenses, and exercise supervision over the 
fulfillment of the quota and license by the member 
organizations; on behalf of the trade organizations, to 
participate in international professional conferences so as to 
strengthen the relationship with the chambers of commerce of 
other countries and establish business contact with them; to 
gather information from the international market concerning 
major import and export commodities so as to provide relevant 
consultation services; entrusted by relevant government 
authorities and member organizations, to organize or represent 
member organizations in handling antidumping and antimonopoly 
cases; to organize member organizations to participate in 
various activities such as exhibitions, observation, and 
marketing both at home and abroad; to maintain the legal rights 
and interests of member organizations and mediate disputes among 
member organizations. 
  2. To do a better job, the Chamber of Commerce must have the 
support of all sides, most of all, the support of the competent 
authorities of economic cooperation and trade at all levels. 
The new economic and trade system consists of three parts: The 
macroeconomic management, the business operation, and the 
coordinating services. They supplement each other and 
coordinate with each other. As far as the work of the Chamber 
of Commerce is concerned, it is new and difficult and needs the 
support from every side, especially the forceful support of the 
government authorities. Government departments should give their 
active support to the Chamber of Commerce in its coordinating 
services so as to provide necessary working conditions for the 
Chamber of Commerce and make it the real link between the 
government and the enterprises and the capable assistant of the 
government. 
  3. To do a better job of its own, the Chamber of Commerce 
should formulate its own rules and regulations which all the 
member organizations are required to abide by. A market economy 
is the economy of law. In some of the developed capitalist 
countries, an important reason why their chambers of commerce 
can play their role is that there are rules and regulations for 
them to follow. Our Chamber of Commerce has met with a lot of 
difficulties in its work, the main reason of which is that there 
are no rules and regulations to follow. In order to bring into 
full play the role of the Chamber of Commerce in socialist 
market economy and to improve the authority and effectiveness of 
the Chamber of Commerce in its coordinating services, there is 
an urgent need for the Chamber of Commerce to formulate its own 
law so as to define clearly its own nature, position, function, 
basic task, organization structure and working method. 
  4. To do a better job, the Chamber of Commerce must firmly 
adopt the idea of serving the member organizations. The basic 
function of the Chamber of Commerce is to provide coordinating 
services. In the last few years, the Chamber of Commerce spared 
no effort in its coordination and management work. With 
deepening reform of the foreign economic and trade system, the 
Chamber of Commerce should make real efforts to shift the focal 
point of its work to providing services. With this aim in mind, 
the Chamber of Commerce should change its idea conscientiously, 
work enthusiastically to broaden the scope and raise the quality 
of its services, and, by so doing, to maintain the rights and 
interests of the state, the trade sector, and the enterprises. 
If it deviates from this aim, the Chamber of Commerce will have 
neither cohesive force for its members nor vitality of its own, 
no matter what kind of power, function, or role is granted to it. 
  5. To do a better job, the Chamber of Commerce will have to 
change its work method and operational mechanism. The Chamber 
of Commerce is neither the superior nor the "mother-in-law" of 
the enterprises, but something like the "parents' home of a 
married woman." Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce should adopt 
a new working method rather than the old style of administrative 
management. To express it more precisely, the working method of 
the Chamber of Commerce should be more democratic, fair, and 
open and characteristic of the "four selfs," that is, all the 
major issues shall be decided by the trade enterprises through 
democratic consultation; all major decisions shall be made by 
valuing the state interests above everything else and, at the 
same time, giving consideration to the interests of all other 
aspects; all the measures, methods, and working arrangements 
should be highly open; each enterprise should begin the practice 
of self-management, self-restriction, self-protection, and 
self-development. 
  6. To do a better job, the Chamber of Commerce should 
enhance 
its organization construction. At present, we must do a good 
job in the following three aspects: Firstly, to establish the 
association of the chambers of commerce. Nowadays, the import 
and export chambers of commerce are all trade organizations. In 
order to intensify the coordination among the chambers of 
commerce, facilitate the exchange with outside world and assist 
government authorities in settling trade disputes, we propose to 
establish a national association of chambers of commerce in the 
economic and trade section on the basis of the existing chambers 
of commerce so as to systematize the import and export chambers 
of commerce and make them more influential and effective. 
Secondly, to consolidate the chambers of commerce. We should 
decide the organization structure and staffing of the chambers 
of commerce, improve and consolidate organization structure of 
commodity societies and offices of the Chamber of Commerce and 
be active in recruiting new qualified members so as to build up 
their representativeness and authoritativeness. Thirdly, to 
built up a team of leading comrades in the Chamber of Commerce. 
We should make great efforts to cultivate a contingent of 
leading professionals for the Chamber of Commerce. While 
streamlining their organizations, the government authorities 
should also transfer some of the outstanding leading comrades to 
reinforce the leading body of the Chamber of Commerce so as to 
enable the Chamber of Commerce to be more prepared for the 
historical task of reform and opening China to the outside world 
and to make still greater contributions to the development of 
the foreign economic cooperation and trade in our country.

<F P=106> [By reporters Li Jianmin (2621 1696 3046) and Wang Yingchun </F>
(3769 6601 2504)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a national 
meeting on the supply of agricultural means of production today, 
State Councillor Chen Junsheng stressed: Supply and marketing 
cooperatives' agricultural production means departments should 
play their role as major suppliers of agricultural means of 
production, and should strive in every possible way to ensure 
that markets for agricultural production means are properly 
supplied. 
  Chen Junsheng said: Agricultural means of production are the 
most basic guarantee for agricultural development. Whether this 
work is done well or poorly will have a direct impact on whether 
the peasants' enthusiasm for production will be effectively 
sustained over a long period. In a certain sense, the work will 
be the most important factor that will decide whether China will 
have a bumper harvest in the agricultural sector in 1994. 
Currently, China is gradually establishing and developing a 
socialist market economy. While multichannel competition is very 
fierce, supply and marketing cooperatives, acting as major 
distributors, still command a majority share of China's total 
sales volume and market. Therefore, they must play their roles 
to stabilize the market. China has successively raised its 
agricultural production, particularly grain production, to 
several higher levels in recent years. Such achievements have 
been inseparably linked to supply and marketing cooperatives 
that supplied agricultural means of production and provided 
other services. We hope they will, as they have done in the 
past, perform their tasks in a down-to-earth manner so as to 
properly do their work in supplying agricultural means of 
production in 1994. 
  Chen Junsheng stressed: In light of the current situation, 
first, we must avoid any drastic fluctuation in the prices of 
agricultural production means. The general situation is that 
China's stability depends on stability in the agricultural 
sector. Appropriately handling agricultural affairs is not the 
sole concern of any single department; it requires that all 
concerned should have the overall picture in mind. The purpose 
of supply and marketing cooperatives playing their role as major 
suppliers of agricultural means of production is to provide 
better services to enhance agricultural production; it is not 
directed at raising profits. Therefore, supply and marketing 
cooperatives at various levels should reduce distribution links 
as much as possible so as to curtail expenses. We should 
eliminate those previously so-called normal circulation links 
that can be eliminated; this move should be considered a reform. 
We should even more resolutely eliminate abnormal circulation 
links. Only then can we lower expenses and prices and in the 
end guarantee the market's smooth circulation with reasonable 
prices that peasants can bear. Second, we should coordinate 
with relevant departments to properly safeguard that markets of 
agricultural production means circulate smoothly. Various 
localities must strictly investigate and handle activities 
detrimental to peasants, including excessive numbers of 
operators dealing in agricultural production means, unreasonable 
increases in commodity prices, and profiteering behavior whereby 
the same commodities are resold several times. Third, we should 
strengthen management of the quality of agricultural means of 
production and establish efficient administrative organizations, 
systems, and procedures to strictly crack down on fake and 
substandard commodities. Supply and marketing cooperatives at 
various levels definitely should not allow fake and substandard 
agricultural means of production to appear on their premises. 
They should ensure that an abundant high-quality supply of 
agricultural means of production will be available for the 
peasants. Fourth, we should establish necessary reserve systems 
to ensure that the requirements for agricultural production and 
disaster relief can be fulfilled.

the provincial people's congress standing committee, the 
provincial government, the provincial committee of the Chinese 
Peoples' Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], the 
provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, and the provincial 
military district held a gathering here to observe the Spring 
Festival. 
  The gathering began at 0900. Jiang Chunyun, member of the 
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of 
the provincial party committee; Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of 
the provincial party committee and governor; Li Zhen, chairman 
of the provincial people's congress standing committee; Lu 
Maozeng, chairman of the provincial CPPCC Committee; Tan Fude, 
secretary of the provincial Discipline Inspection Commission; Yi 
Yuanqiu, commander of the provincial military district; and Liu 
Guofu, political commissar, were seated on the front row of the

attending the gathering and to all people across the province on 
behalf of the provincial party committee, the provincial 
people's congress standing committee, the provincial government, 
the provincial CPPCC Committee, the provincial Discipline 
Inspection Commission, and the provincial military district. 
  Jiang Chunyun gave a speech at the gathering. He said: The 
past year was very unusual. It was a year during which we 
advanced courageously on the road to socialist modernization. 
Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, people 
across the province conscientiously implemented the guidelines 
of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, deepened reform, expanded the degree 
of opening up, and actively promoted the building of two 
civilizations, thus giving rise to an excellent situation of 
political and social stability, economic development, and 
invigoration in all fields of work throughout the province. 
This is the result of the united efforts and hard work of the 
broad masses of party members and cadres across the province to 
overcome serious natural disasters and all sorts of difficulties 
and to advance and make progress in a pioneering spirit. Let me 
extend festive greetings and cordial regards to the broad masses 
of party members and cadres working on all fronts on behalf of 
the provincial party committee and the provincial government. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: This is a crucial year for 
comprehensively promoting reform and building the socialist 
market operational mechanism. The tasks will be glorious but 
arduous. During this year we should rally more closely around 
the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
nucleus, persist in taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line as the guidance, act in line with the work principles 
defined by the party Central Committee and the State Council, 
deeply implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and 
the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
accelerate the pace of building the socialist market economic 
structure, and maintain a sustained, speedy and sound national 
economic development. It is necessary to realistically 
strengthen the building of the party, clean politics, spiritual 
civilization, democracy, and the legal system, maintain 
political stability, and promote a comprehensive social 
progress. In the course of building the two civilizations, all 
levels and all trades and professions across the province should 
be subordinated to and serve the overall situation of seizing 
the opportunity to comprehensively deepen reform, expanding 
opening up, and promoting the development of the socialist 
market economic structure, further emancipate the mind, seek 
truth from facts, engage in arduous struggle, exert vigorous 
efforts to make the country strong, and strive to win a new 
victory in socialist modernization with new ideas, a new 
attitude, a new work style, and new achievements.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "At the 10th Enlarged Executive </F>
Meeting of the Municipal Government, Huang Ju Calls For 
Maintaining Sustained Economic Development and Social Stability, 
Working Hard To Strive for a Good Beginning in Various Tasks, 
Paying Attention to the National Macroeconomic Trend, and 
Properly Resolving Difficulties and Problems in the Operations 
of the Economy"] 
  [Text] The municipal government held its 10th enlarged 
executive meeting yesterday. In his speech, Mayor Huang Ju 
emphatically noted: We should regard the work of maintaining 
sustained economic development and social stability as an 
important matter and create a favorable environment for 
deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and 
promoting development. We should conscientiously do a good job 
in various aspects of work to make sure that Shanghai's economy 
will continue a good momentum for development this year. 
  Huang Ju analyzed the current situation at the meeting and 
said: This is a crucial year for us to implement the guidelines 
in the "decision" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee and to advance the reform by 
establishing a socialist market economic system. This is also a 
decisive year for all Shanghai citizens to bring about "a change 
every year and a significant change in three years." Taking a 
look at the situation in January, we have had a good beginning: 
The economy continued to maintain the momentum for sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development and all important measures for 
reform, opening up, development, and the stability arranged at 
the beginning of this year proceeded smoothly. The work on 
distribution in rural areas is being carried on in full swing, 
and the prevention of epidemics is firmly under control. All 
kinds of preparatory work for market supplies during the Spring 
Festival are basically in place, and a revenue-sharing system 
between the municipality and districts and counties has been 
preliminarily determined. Other tasks are also proceeding 
properly. 
  Speaking on the work for February, Huang Ju stressed: Under 
the favorable conditions, we must remain sober-minded, pay 
special attention to the national macroeconomic trend, and 
attach importance to and overcome difficulties. Proceeding from 
the realities in Shanghai, we should work earnestly to properly 
resolve difficulties and problems in the operations of the 
economy. Then Huang Ju put forward measures for tackling 
problems in opening up markets, enterprises' capital and 
economic returns, foreign investment and trade, and other 
fields. In the meantime, Huang Ju proposed that it was 
necessary to adhere to the unified arrangement of the state in 
comprehensively and earnestly implementing the important reform 
in financing, taxation, banking, foreign trade, and investment 
which has been determined by the central authorities. The work 
of instituting the revenue-sharing system between the 
municipality and districts and counties should be continued 
thoroughly and meticulously. The work within districts and 
counties should also be stressed properly, and all departments 
and units must take the overall situation into account and help 
one another like people crossing a river in the same boat, so as 
to constantly improve this reform, inspire the enthusiasm of 
both the municipality as well as districts and counties, and 
really put this system into practice with satisfactory results. 
Huang Ju stressed: Under the condition in which greater action 
will be taken to promote the reform of the economic system this 
year, we must do a good job in linking up the old system with 
the new one, and ensure a timely and smooth transition toward 
the new system, so that there is no fracture and disorder in the 
transition. We should minimize the influence of the replacement 
of the old system with the new one on the operations of economy 
to ensure sustained, rapid, and stable economic development [chi 
xu kuai su wen ding fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 4489 1353 4099 
1455] in Shanghai in the first quarter of this year. 
  Huang Ju said: Shanghai is enjoying social stability, and 
the basic conditions are good currently, but some new 
contradictions and problems also exist. Governments at various 
levels must make greater efforts to handle well the relations 
between reform, development, and stability. They should treat 
social stability as an important matter, proceed in their work 
meticulously and conscientiously, create a favorable environment 
for deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and 
promoting development; and make sure that the great number of 
Shanghai citizens will enjoy a happy traditional holiday in the 
atmosphere of stability and peace. To this end, we must first 
step up the rectification and management of social order to 
maintain public security and stability. While continuing our 
efforts to strictly crack down on crimes, we should strengthen 
the comprehensive management of social security and earnestly 
remain on our guard before and after the festival. Leaders at 
various levels should persist in going right to the forefront to 
organize the implementation of security measures for safe 
production, construction, and transportation; ensuring heat 
supplies; and forestalling fires, explosions, and poisonings; as 
well as continue to improve the emergency measures against thick 
fog, blizzards, and frost during the holidays. They should 
seriously organize the two-week campaign of straightening out 
the municipality's traffic, appearance, and environment to greet 
the Spring Festival. Departments in charge of municipal affairs 
and traffic management should spare no effort in bringing 
traffic under strict control; all districts and counties should 
firmly sweep away those taking up streets and setting up stalls 
at random and other violations of rules; and all major streets, 
residential areas, and commercial outlets should conscientiously 
carry out the measures of maintaining and ensuring a clean 
Shanghai. Second, we should make meticulous arrangements to 
ensure market supplies during the holidays and step up the 
construction of the "vegetable basket" project, particularly the 
construction of the "green vegetable project." Under the 
current conditions of a better shopping environment and more 
abundant supplies of commodities on the market, we should 
particularly pay attention to the demand of various levels, 
facilitate the masses' consumption during the holidays, and 
enhance the supervision of commodity prices and the management 
of food hygiene. Third, we should persist in properly carrying 
out the campaign of showing concern for the poor by seriously 
implementing the measures of resolving their problems and 
helping them and doing some helpful deeds for them in a 
down-to-earth manner. Governments and leading cadres at all 
levels must assume the responsibilities of leadership to ensure 
safety. 
  In conclusion, Huang Ju said: This is a crucial point for 
deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting 
development, and maintaining the current stability. We must 
seize the opportunity, concentrate our efforts on these tasks, 
make serious arrangements, quietly immerse ourselves in hard 
work, and never relax in striving for a good beginning in all 
aspects of work and for further progress in the work within this 
year. 
  Vice Mayor Meng Jianzhu relayed to the meeting the 
guidelines 
of the national conference on the "vegetable basket" and grain, 
cotton, and oil project. 
  Also attending the meeting were Vice Mayors Zhao Qizheng, 
Xie 
Lijuan, Xia Keqiang, Sha Lin, and Gong Xueping, and persons in 
charge of various commissions, offices, and bureaus under the 
municipal government, as well as district and county governments.

<F P=106> ["Mayor Huang Ju's Congratulatory Letter to the Shanghai </F>
Conference for Promoting Computer Use of and Developing the 
Computer Industry"] 
  [Text] Comrades: 
  At this important time, when all sectors in Shanghai are 
carrying out the "Decision" made by the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee and going all out to establish a 
socialist market economic system, the holding of this meeting to 
promote computer use and develop the computer industry in 
Shanghai fully demonstrates the earnest expectations and firm 
determination of the municipal party committee and municipal 
government to speed up the development of the computer industry. 
I wish to take this opportunity to express my warm 
congratulations to this meeting [of the Shanghai Municipal Party 
Committee and the municipal government called on 1 February to 
promote the use of computers and the development of the computer 
industry]! I am convinced this meeting will go down in history 
as a turning point for the development of the computer industry 
in Shanghai. 
  The success Shanghai has achieved, from developing its first 
computer to having established a computer industry and trained a 
relatively strong contingent of computer scientists and 
technicians, embodies the painstaking efforts of several 
generations in Shanghai. Aside from exploring and developing new 
technologies, the significance of the development of computers 
rests even more on promoting the use of computers and developing 
the computer industry so that, like Shanghai's automobile and 
telecommunications industries, our computer industry will also 
become a major industry and a new benchmark for industrial 
growth. This is the urgent task confronting us today. 
  "Science and technology are the primary productive forces." 
As one of today's high-tech industries, the computer 
information industry is the foundation and prerequisite of all 
high-tech industries. The development of this industry and the 
widespread use of computers will significantly expedite the 
progress of economic, technological, and social development. 
Shanghai's economic revitalization has everything to do with 
the use of computers and the development of its computer 
industry. The rapid growth of the computer industry will 
certainly and significantly expedite Shanghai's economic 
take-off and prosperity. Only when we understand the role 
played by the computer industry from such a strategic 
perspective can we make the firmest determination to surmount 
the toughest problems, explore new fields, and boost the 
development of this industry like we have done in promoting our 
automobile and telecommunications industries. 
  To promote the use of computers and the development of the 
computer industry, we need a sense of urgency and a strong 
awareness of market needs. No matter how advanced its 
technology may be, an industry will not have the solid basis it 
needs for development if society does not need it. Thus, to 
promote the use of computers and the development of the computer 
industry, Shanghai must do away with its traditional way of 
thinking and must face the market, produce according to the 
guidance provided by the market, and open the market with 
products. The computer market in China is potentially broad. 
We must take steps to promote the use of computers in the 
banking, postal and telecommunications, commercial and trading, 
industrial, and construction sectors -- in which the use of 
computers is extensive -- beginning with the development of the 
software they need. We must create a new situation for the 
development of the computer industry by helping people see both 
the real significance of computer use and the enormous 
capabilities of computers in improving efficiencies and 
achieving higher returns. Only when market needs provide 
guidance and pull can the development of the computer industry 
have a bright future and boundless hopes. 
  Like other high-tech industries, the development of the 
computer industry also rests with the training of proficient 
personnel. While the development, management, and use of 
computers requires a large number of highly proficient 
scientists, developers, and managers as well as promoters and 
sellers, promoting the use of computers also rests with the 
quality of the people in the country. Thus, when we promote the 
use of computers and develop the computer industry, we must also 
attach great importance to training proficient personnel. 
Efforts in this regard include hiring specialists from abroad, 
training people to use computers, and sponsoring sizable 
educational programs to train computer users. Only by doing this 
can we ensure the development of Shanghai's computer industry 
continues to escalate. 
  Comrades, the situation in Shanghai today is both gratifying 
and pressing. Let us act immediately and strive to make 
Shanghai's computer industry into another pillar industry which 
can further expedite Shanghai's economic development. 
  [Signed] Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai 
  [Dated] 1 February 1994

  [Text] Shanghai, February 11 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
largest business center, has made a strategic shift in its 
industrial restructuring, giving priority to sectors which are 
low in raw material consumption and are strongly backed by 
hi-tech. 
  Five pillar industries include automobiles, bio-medicine, 
communication facilities, computer and power station facilities, 
whose annual sales are expected to surpass 100 billion yuan by 
the end of this century. 
  According to local leaders, the shift is based on the harsh 
reality that the city faces tough competition from its 
neighbouring provinces which have abundant raw materials and a 
booming consumer market in certain fields. 
  In 1993, sales of the five pillar industries reached 43 
billion yuan, within the city's industrial total of 323.7 
billion yuan. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises play a major role in these 
sectors. 
  Sales of the auto industry, the heavy-weight among the five, 
achieved 30 billion yuan last year and are expected to reach 50 
billion yuan by 2000. 
  Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Co. Ltd, a Sino-German joint 
venture, turned out 100,000 Santana sedans in 1993, bringing in 
10 billion yuan, accounting for a third of the industry's total. 
  The company plans to roll out 300,000 sedans in 1997. 
  Foreign-invested firms are also seen as backbones in the 
other four fields. For example, ten out of the 18 hi-tech 
communication enterprises have introduced considerable sums of 
overseas money. 
  It is said that the city's top officials are to focus 
attention on these sectors. Mayor Huang Ju will be in charge of 
the auto industry, and party chief Wu Bangguo, communications. 
  They said Shanghai will bring in more funds and technology 
from abroad and will foster a strong research force. 
  According to the city's ambitious plan, there will be 
several 
conglomerates emerging in these fields, each with more than one 
billion yuan in sales.

<F P=106> [Commentary from the "Commentary on Current Economic </F>
Affairs" column by Mu Wei (4476 0251): "Market Construction Must 
Be Compatible With Market Laws"] 
  [Text] In last week's "Commentary on Current Economic 
Affairs" column, it was proposed that attention be paid to 
"problems in the process of building the market." This is a 
proposal worthy of our close attention. Our country started 
belatedly in building the market, and yet the momentum has been 
quite strong. We truly need to learn from the successful 
experiences of economically developed countries and regions in 
building the market and draw lessons from their failures to 
avoid detours as much as possible and to bring our market 
construction onto the path of healthy, regular, and orderly 
[jian kang gui fan you xu di 0256 1660 6016 5400 2589 1645 4104] 
development. To do this, the most important thing is to operate 
the market according to economic laws. The "Shanghai Joint 
Automobile Exchange Market," which was set up to meet demands, 
has blazed a new trail in operating according to market laws, 
and it has provided many revelations. 
  One of the revelations is that Shanghai should seize the 
opportunity to make a head start in building a socialist market 
economic structure. Statistics show that China's automobile 
production and sales continued to grow in 1993, and the basic 
pattern is supply exceeding demand. The total number of cars 
produced in the country last year reached 1.3 million, while 
demand remained at 1.25 million or so. There are currently more 
than 100 automobile manufacturers, over 700 vehicle modification 
and special vehicle producing enterprises, and several thousand 
dealers. The automobile industry is a backbone of the nation's 
industry. While we must protect the enthusiasm for developing 
the automobile industry, rushing headlong into the automobile 
market like a swarm of bees can hardly produce the economies of 
scale of a large market and will make our efforts to build a 
uniform national market go up in smoke; this is detrimental to 
the interests of the producers, suppliers, and consumers. 
Shanghai, on the other hand, possesses favorable conditions for 
building a unified national automobile market. Its output of 
Santanas reached 100,000 last year, nearly half of the nation's 
total output. In addition, it has more than 300 automobile 
dealers and over 20 car manufacturing and vehicle modification 
plants. Because of the necessity to build a unified national 
market, it will be very important for Shanghai, which occupies 
an important place in China's car production and sales, to build 
a specialized national automobile market ahead of other places; 
this will help change the current state of affairs of China's 
automobile industry, which is suffering from clogged circulation 
channels of supply and demand, chaotic price signals, slow 
market feedback, and sluggish structural adjustment. We should 
exercise extreme care in building specialized markets and 
refrain from blindly "going for it" while disregarding existing 
conditions. However, we must lose no time in meticulously 
preparing for building the market when we are sure it is the 
correct thing to do, so as to allow the automobile, an important 
material resource, to play a bigger role in the national economy. 
  The second revelation is that market construction must be 
compatible with market economic laws. For example, it is 
necessary to select different trading methods according to 
characteristics of commodities, and not simply follow the market 
craze. The "Joint Automobile Exchange Market" is a specialized 
automobile market based mainly on direct contacts and spot 
trading among producers, suppliers, and consumers, and is not 
prepared to introduce the futures trading mechanism. The 
practice is compatible with the general laws of market economy. 
There are special requirements for futures trading. For 
example, product standards and varieties must be simple; 
standardization of product quality must be easy; price 
fluctuation range must be wide; large quantity purchases and 
sales must be possible; and products must mostly be large 
quantities of primary products such as grains and nonferrous 
metals. Not all products, such as finished industrial goods, 
are suitable for futures trading. Automobiles are finished 
products, and the spot trading method is suitable as long as 
buyers and sellers reach agreements. In addition, there is now 
a balance of supply and demand for automobiles and prices have 
stabilized over a certain period, making automobiles unsuitable 
for the futures trade. In addition, the diversified range and 
flexible spot trading method can meet the demands of suppliers 
and consumers at different levels. It is also much better than 
the futures trading mechanism. This shows that selecting a 
trading method compatible with market laws is a prerequisite to 
normal market development. 
  The third revelation is that in the process of market 
construction, the government should correctly identify its role. 
The "Joint Automobile Exchange Market" was organized through the 
leadership of the industry and commerce departments. However, 
it is not aimed at profit-making and the government cannot 
directly intervene in the market's economic activities. The 
government has essentially avoided committing a common error 
when involved in market construction, that is, extending its 
power in the market. In reality, when the government extends 
its power in economic activities it will definitely create chaos 
in the market. The government should only play its role in 
regularizing enterprise activities, safeguarding market order, 
and protecting operators' interests. It should only act as a 
"referee" and not an "athlete" who directly participates in the 
competition. We should particularly remember the profound 
lessons we have learned in the past. 
  Building a new socialist market economic system is linked 
very closely to market construction. In the past, we committed 
errors in our undertakings and understanding in the process of 
market construction. By the time we realized our errors, 
certain opportunities were already lost. When taking the lead 
in building a new socialist market economic system, Shanghai 
must not repeat the same misfortune. Shanghai should be 
commended for succeeding in many of its undertakings in 
establishing the automobile market. Do you agree with the 
points discussed here?

<F P=106> [By reporter Jiang Xinhe (5592 1800 0735): "Shanghai </F>
Invigorates Its Foreign Trade By Emancipating the Mind and 
Changing the Management Mechanism"] 
  [Text] Last year, Shanghai experienced a tortuous course in 
its foreign trade, which began with a drop and ended with an 
increase. Exports in the first half of 1993 reached only $3.343 
billion, an increase of 6.58 percent compared to 1992. In July 
1993, Shanghai's exports decreased by 15.5 percent compared to 
the same period in 1992. As of August 1993, the city's exports 
not only failed to meet their quota but also became a 
"bottleneck" and restrictive factor for Shanghai's economic 
development. Under the leadership of the municipal party 
committee and the government, with the support of various 
fronts, and thanks to the hard work of cadres, workers, and 
staff members of all foreign trade enterprises and individually 
run export enterprises in the city, Shanghai's exports began to 
jump in the third quarter and reached $7.382 billion at the end 
of 1993, thus fulfilling the annual quota of $7.34 billion set 
by the municipal people's congress and the government. 
  What does this fact show? 
  First, it shows that Shanghai cannot experience the great 
development of foreign trade without emancipating the mind and 
exploring new ideas. Despite experiencing a decline in foreign 
trade in the first six months of last year, Shanghai began to 
boost its foreign trade in the next six months. The important 
reason for the increase is: Since the municipal meeting on 
foreign economic relations and trade held in June 1993, cadres, 
workers, and staff members of all foreign trade companies began 
to reconsider their ideologies and ideas formed in the past. 
They began to free themselves from the ideological shackles of 
the planned economy and to foster a sense of the importance of 
market competition, as well as of large-scale foreign trade, 
trading ports, trading groups, and services. The city's silk 
products import and export company and its garments import and 
export company began to change the bureaucratic styles of 
business often demonstrated in the past by improving their 
services. As a result, they began to stand firmly in a severely 
competitive environment. Last year, they became the first- and 
second-largest exporting companies. In shattering the 
restrictions on its scope of business, in 1993 the Lansheng 
Company began to export machinery and electrical appliances for 
the first time. The Machinery and Electrical Appliances Import 
and Export Company took drastic measures to restructure its 
organization by converting 16 departments into 10 constituent 
companies which assume sole responsibility for profits and 
losses. As a result, the company earned 13.15 percent more in 
foreign exchange than in 1992. 
  The fact also proves that major reforms undertaken by 
Shanghai in foreign economic relations and in trade, operating 
mechanisms, and management methods are effective. At the 
municipal meeting on foreign economic relations and trade held 
in June 1993, Mayor Huang Ju said: It is necessary to take the 
lead in establishing a new system for foreign economic relations 
and trade that conforms to international practices, that 
dovetails with international markets, and that is suited to a 
socialist market economy. In following this requirement, the 
city took the nationwide lead in introducing a series of reform 
measures last year. Among them, the important ones are: 
Mandatory plans for all kinds of foreign trade companies to 
export, to earn foreign exchange, and turn it over to the state 
were abandoned. A plan for reforming distribution methods was 
introduced, thus enabling wages to increase in line with the net 
increase of foreign exchange earnings. More enterprises in the 
import and export sector were given decision-making powers. The 
business scope of foreign trade enterprises was expanded. Such 
large-scale reforms, the first in Shanghai's history of foreign 
trade, have effectively helped the city. As a result, its 
exports demonstrated a shift from a decrease to an increase. 
  The fact also proves that it is very important to establish 
a 
mechanism for building momentum inside the enterprise. A group 
of enterprises in Shanghai had already paid attention to this 
problem last year. The Shenda Textile and Garments Company 
introduced a stimulation mechanism designed to promote exports 
through wage increases and prizes. As a result, the company 
took second place for individually run enterprises. 
  According to some experts, Shanghai still has to make great 
efforts to maintain this year's favorable export momentum. Only 
by fundamentally solving the deep-seated contradictions created 
under the planned economy and the problem under which the 
current system of foreign economic relations and trade is not 
able to adapt itself to the changed situation can Shanghai 
overcome two threatening problems in its foreign trade -- a lack 
of mobility and a lack of sustained momentum.

<F P=106> [By correspondents Yong Hanrong (0516 3352 2837) and Ding </F>
Jian (0002 1017): "Do a Good Job in Wage System Reform and 
Promote Social Stability and Economic Development" -- Cai 
Songyue Speaks at the Provincial Work Conference on Reforming 
the Wage System in Organizations and Institutions] 
  [Text] It is reported at a provincial work conference on 
reforming the wage system in organizations and institutions that 
was held yesterday: The reform of the wage system has been 
formally implemented in our province and some pay raise plans 
covered in this wage system reform are expected to be carried 
out before the Spring Festival. 
  Cai Songyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and executive vice governor, addressed the meeting. 
He said: The main purpose of this wage system reform is to 
establish a new distribution system that is needed in the 
socialist market economic structure and to ensure that the new 
system is on the right track. On the basis of summing up and 
learning from experiences gained from the last two wage system 
reforms in 1956 and 1985, this reform is in line with the 
requirements of the socialist market economic structure and 
personnel system reform, and different wage systems have been 
established in light of the differences among various 
organizations and institutions. While graduated wage scales 
commensurate with one's office have been established in 
government organizations, different wage systems have has been 
established in insitutions in accordance with their different 
natures, such as education, scientific research, public health, 
survey and drawing, transportation, marine science, aquatic 
products, culture, art, sports, and finance, reflecting the 
different features of different sectors. In this way, we can 
gradually separate the wage systems of institutions from that of 
government organizations and make these systems work well on 
their own special tracks. Through this reform, we will also 
establish regular mechanisms governing pay raises to broaden pay 
raise channels. In accordance with the plans made by central 
authorities, we will launch a regional subsidy system this year. 
  Cai Songyue said: The provincial party committee and 
government are very concerned about this wage system reform and 
attach great importance to it. They demand that the pay raise 
plans be implemented as soon as possible. In view of the short 
time left before the Spring Festival, the provincial party 
committee and government decided to pay out part of the money in 
advance and allocate the rest to individuals after the Spring 
Festival. He said: To do a good job in this wage system 
reform, we must first have a concensus of views on the wage 
reform plan drawn up by the CPC Central Committee. This plan is 
the policy basis for this wage system reform. We must follow 
the guiding thought and major principles prescribed in the plan 
to organize and do our work. After the wage system reform is 
implemented, the wages of various personnel will be raised in 
one way or another, but not as much as people expect. We should 
have a correct understating about this. Both the central and 
provincial financial organs have done their best to carry out 
the pay raise plan in this wage system reform. Under conditions 
of relative financial dificulty it is not easy to allocate such 
a great amount of money for wage system reform. We cannot just 
use up all of the money to solve current problems. We still 
need to spend money on construction and substantially increase 
investment in educational, cultural, and social undertakings. 
  Cai Songyue stressed: The current reform of the wage 
system is a major step the state has taken in exercising 
macroeconomic regulation and control over the remuneration 
system. The project will be complex and difficult since it is a 
matter that involves a broad range of issues and concerns the 
overall situation. This being the case, the established 
regulations, policies, and standards must be followed while 
proceeding with the project. No area or unit may go its own way 
and launch its own programs under the excuse that its situation 
is special. Plans drawn up by central and provincial 
authorities must be strictly followed and counter moves are 
absolutely not allowed. Those who disregard and disobey the 
regulations, orders, and prohibitions of the central authorities 
and who go their own ways must be sternly handled once their 
misconduct has been ascertained. The current wage system reform 
has a close bearing on the vital interests of personnel in 
Zhejiang government organizations and institutions and on the 
stability and unity of society as a whole. Party committees and 
governments at all levels must attach great importance to the 
plan and implement it with meticulous efforts. Since cadres and 
working personnel will have all kinds of ideas on the reform, we 
should conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological and political 
work among them so that we can create an environment and 
conditions conducive to reform. When the reform plan is 
actually carried out, governments at all levels must intensify 
their coordination, promptly understand and discover new 
situations, and study and properly handle problems that may 
arise. 
  Cai Songyue urged all personnel affairs departments in 
Zhejiang to seize the current opportunity to speed up reform of 
their personnel systems and build themselves into stronger 
departments so that they can do an even better job in serving 
economic construction and contribute to building a socialist 
market economic system. Personnel in charge of provincial 
departments and relevant leading cadres of various cities, 
prefectures, and counties attended the meeting.

  [Text] Guangdong officials used to call it the Game of 
Marginal Ball. To borrow a metaphor from tennis, it can be 
translated as: while Beijing sets the rules of the game, 
Guangdong draws the lines of the court. 
  When Beijing last December announced a capital gains tax 
with 
a maximum tax rate of 200 per cent starting this year, the 
initial reaction from Guangdong officials was that it was not 
applicable to the southern province. And two months later, 
provincial cadres knew how to play the new game. 
  Instead of bouncing the tax law back to Beijing, local 
cadres 
admitted that the new regulation, signed into law by premier Li 
Peng last December, was as good in Guangdong as in other 
provinces. But on the other hand, they also reminded foreign 
investors as well as Beijing that any laws -- not just the 
capital gains tax -- must take into consideration the concept of 
"local reality". 
  The reality, as Guangdong officials described it, is an 
insatiable demand for property -- both residential and 
commercial. To catch up with other developing Asian economies in 
15 years they must go full steam ahead to develop its property 
market. 
  For example, under the Great Metropolis Development Plan 
announced by Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu, the provincial capital 
will expand to three times its present size reaching a total 
area of 550 square kilometres by 2010. A total of 3.43 million 
square metres of new houses will be needed by the end of this 
century. In addition, the city Government will be responsible 
for finding accommodation for the 38,000 couples expected to 
marry over the next six years. 
  The market temperature was heated further by a commercial 
boom in Guangzhou last year. Hong Kong real estate giants such 
as Cheung Kong and New World Development have already queued up 
for contracts in the city. 
  Such "reality", Guangzhou officials contend are a very good 
reason why the city should be treated differently under the new 
tax rule. 
  In a recent interview with the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST, Jin 
Yiguo, Director of the Market Administration Department of 
Guangzhou Real Estate Management Bureau, said there were 
"questions" over how the new tax rule could be implemented in 
the regions. First, there is the question of the nature of the 
capital gains tax. 
  According to Mr. Jin, there was no clear definition whether 
the new tax was a central government tax or a revenue earner for 
the local authorities. 
  "My understanding is that it is the opinion of the city 
(Communist Party standing committee) that first the law will be 
enforced in Guangzhou. 
  "Second, (we) must enforce it in accordance with the actual 
situation in Guangzhou...and fully take into consideration that 
we have already collected a land price from the investors, he 
said. 
  "In principle, we should not add an extra (tax) burden on 
investors and this is as much I can say (about the tax law) at 
this moment," he added.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Guangdong To Practice the Civil </F>
Service System and Plans To Complete Wage Reform in the First 
Half of This Year"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 13 Feb (TA KUNG PAO)--Guangdong Province 
will vigorously pursue and establish a civil service system, 
which will be followed by wage system reform, an important 
component of the personnel system. 
  It has been learned that all units in Guangdong, which carry 
out institutional reform this year, should promptly practice the 
civil service system in coordination with progress in 
institutional reform. 
  According to the schedule, the provincial-level 
administrative organs should conduct experiments in the first 
half of this year and basically complete it in the first quarter 
of next year, and administrative organs at the city, county, 
township, and town levels should begin experiments in the second 
half of this year. 
  The plan for reforming the wage system in Guangdong's state 
organs and nonprofit institutions is scheduled to be basically 
completed in the first half of this year. The present wage 
reform focuses on the establishment of a normal incremental wage 
system, with state organs and nonprofit institutions practicing 
different wage systems. State organs are to practice a 
post-rank wage system, which will be composed of four parts, 
i.e. post wage, rank wage, basic wage, and seniority wage. 
  Nonprofit institutions are to practice five different kinds 
of wage system among specialized technical personnel. The 
first, covering educational, scientific research, public health, 
and other nonprofit institutions, is a specialized technical 
post-rank wage system; the second, covering geological, survey 
and drawing, marine, aquatic, and other nonprofit institutions, 
is a specialized technical post wage system; the third, covering 
cultural, art, and other performing organizations, is an art 
structure wage system; the fourth, covering athletes, is a 
sports allowance and bonus system; and the fifth, covering 
financial units, is a rank wage system. A staff post-rank wage 
system is to be practiced among the administrative personnel of 
nonprofit institutions. 
  Wages in nonprofit institutions are divided into two parts, 
the fixed part and the active part. The former chiefly reflects 
the level of staff and the latter their actual work amount so as 
to encourage specialized technical personnel to concentrate 
their energy on doing their own jobs or tasks well.

<F P=106> [Report: "There are 24 Development Zones in Hainan With </F>
Areas Ranking First in the Whole Country"] 
  [Text] Hainan Province was founded less than six years ago 
but the number and area of stretches of land used for 
development are in a lead position. In particular, 30 square km 
piece of land in Yangpu, which is being developed by foreign 
businessmen, is affirmed and seen by various sectors as the 
"Yangpu Model." 
  According to official Hainan statistics, so far, 24 
development zones in the province approved by the State Council 
and the provincial government have been established throughout 
the province, with the planned area totaling 294.84 square km; 
18 approved provincial-level scenic spots have been established, 
with a total planned area of 877.09 square km; and 95 projects 
to develop stretches of land have been established by various 
counties and cities of their own accord, with the planned area 
reaching 488.21 square km. To develop the abovementioned plots 
of land, a total of 17.417 billion yuan and $398 million was 
invested and the construction of as many as 725 projects began. 
  At present, many large industrial projects, each with an 
investment amount of hundreds of million yuan, have established 
inside development zones, including a silicon chip plant, a 
cotton-acrylic tire fabric [mian lun lian zi bu 4875 4858 1588 
1311 1580] plant, and the Hainan Natural Chemical Fertilizer 
Plant. The authorities concerned have pointed out: There is 
full growth in the development zones in Hainan in general and 
Haikou in particular, will become a modern city equipped with 
all the necessary facilities. For example, over the past five 
years, more than 3 billion yuan in development funds have been 
invested in the financial trade development zone in Haikou, the 
area under construction exceeded 2 million square meters, and 
the construction of more than 110 high-storey and 
super-high-storey buildings has been completed. On the other 
hand, over the past several years, Jinpan Industrial Development 
Zone, which is also located in Haikou, introduced a total of 109 
industrial projects, 28 of which have begun operating, thus 
creating over 1 billion yuan in output value. 
  The flourishing development of stretches of land in Hainan 
is 
closely related to its enjoyment of the preferential policies 
granted by the central authorities and the provincial 
government. Zones developing stretches of land as "experimental 
zones" in the province's reform and opening up, have taken the 
first step to make experiments. As far as the pattern of 
development and administration is concerned, enterprises are 
allowed to vigorously explore new patterns of development and 
administration in line with the requirements of the market 
economy. 
  At present, various development zones can choose from a 
number of development and administrative patterns, which are 
flexible and diversified, in light of their own conditions: 
Government-entrusted enterprise contracting development, joint 
development by government and enterprises, sole investment by 
enterprises, joint development, solely-invested development by 
foreign businessmen, unified management by government organs, 
unified management by development companies, management by 
organizations jointly formed by the government and enterprises, 
and unified management by foreign businessmen. 
  Preferential policies lift restrictions on constructors of 
development zones. Due to the reorganization of joint-stock 
companies, which was first implemented in the development zones, 
more than 4 billion yuan of capital stocks have been raised 
within the companies and in society and invested in the 
construction of over 20 development zones.

  [Text] Geneva, February 14 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese 
representative to the UN Human Rights Commission Monday [14 
February] retorted attacks by some non-governmental 
organizations of some countries on the Chinese government over 
the issue of Tibet. 
  Representatives from a handful of non-governmental 
organizations sold the idea of "independence of Tibet" in their 
speeches in the commission's session today. They alleged that 
the ethnic Tibetans are becoming a minority in Tibet, and that 
the Chinese government restricts religious freedom there. 
  Zhang Yishan, the Chinese representative, said there is 
nothing new in their speeches today, which are only a repetition 
of some old lies. 
  Zhang said it is known to all that since the 13th century, 
Tibet has been an inseparable part of the Chinese territory. 
  China has been exercising its sovereign rights over Tibet 
for 
more than 700 years, and no country in the world has ever 
recognized any kind of independence of Tibet, he said. 
  He added that the conclusion of some agreements between the 
central government of China and the local government of Tibet in 
1950 is purely China's internal affairs. 
  He pointed out that it is a blatant violation of the 
principles and purpose of the United Nations charter for some 
people to describe this event as "Chinese occupation of Tibet." 
  On the Tibetan population, Zhang cited a census conducted in 
July 1990 by the Chinese government in Tibet, which showed that 
the number of ethnic Tibetans there are 2.096 million, about 
95.46 percent of the total population in the area. 
  The ethnic Han population living in Tibet is slightly higher 
than 80,000, about 3.7 percent of the total population, the 
census shows. 
  Zhang said this indicates that the claim that Tibetans are 
becoming a minority is totally groundless. 
  Zhang finally pointed out that some non-governmental 
organizations are politically motivated and irresponsible when 
they create and spread lies about Tibet. 
  However, lies will be lies even they are repeated a thousand 
times, he said, adding that the action of some people on the 
issue of Tibet only exposes the fact that these people are not 
really interested in human rights, but only in attaining their 
own goals by using the issue of human rights.

  [Text] Construction of the airport railway has received a 
major boost after the Mass Transit Railway Corporation [MTRC] 
revealed international banks had pledged more than $12 billion 
to help finance the 34-kilometre long link. The offers were 
unsolicited and show the confidence finance houses have in the 
project. 
  About 10 banks have offered to provide the cash which 
represents more than half the $22 billion MTRC estimated it 
would cost to build the airport and north Lantau railway in 
1991. As a result there is likely to be more than enough money 
to build the airport railway if China agrees to the latest 
financing proposal to inject $60 billion in equity to the 
railway and airport projects. as the airport's cost was 
estimated to be $43 billion. 
  "The fact that financial institutions are willing to lend 
this money even though Britain and China have still to agree an 
airport railway financing deal shows how confident they are." 
said Roger Moss MTRC's finance director. "When we tell them the 
airport railway will make money they believe us because we have 
proved to them in the past that our projections are correct." 
  He explained the offers had been made because of the MTRC's 
extremely good connections but confirmed no loan agreements had 
been made or signed. If MTRC takes up the banks' offers, 
interest rates and payments would be negotiated as normal. 
  One of the banks involved is Banque Nationale de Paris which 
refused to discuss its involvement. But other banks expressed 
amazement at so much money being offered. 
  "The news is surprising because people have been talking 
about the project in the market but have heard nothing 
specific." said Wilson Wong Siu-wah, corporate finance manager 
with ANZ Asia, who revealed there is pent-up demand to help 
finance the railway. "The railway is very attractive because it 
is a major project in Hong Kong. Generally banks do not like 
long-term financing of 15 years or more and will only lend over 
five to 10 years but the railway is an exceptional case backed 
as it is by a quasi-government organisation." 
  His comments were echoed by another leading European banker 
who believed that while "$12 billion is still a lot of money 
even for Hong Kong," more than 100 finance houses in the 
territory would be willing to commit themselves to the kind of 
long-term financing needed for the airport railway. With that 
kind of interest, the MTRC would be able to negotiate the best 
deal available, he said.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Capital's $82m Trade Surplus a Good Sign"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing posted a foreign trade surplus of $82 
million last month, indicating China may be on the way to 
recovering from last year's $12.2 billion deficit. 
  However, nationwide figures are not yet available. 
  The capital's imports and exports rose 120 per cent from 
January last year to $183 million. Imports were about $50 
million, up 116 per cent. 
  The municipal government said yesterday that the Shougang 
Company (Capital Iron and Steel Complex) increased its exports 
by $8.01 million, a bigger rise than any other firm in the city. 
  Shougang is one of China's largest corporations and 
Beijing's 
leading earner of foreign exchange. 
  Exports from the Beijing Machinery Equipment Import and 
Export Corporation rose 620 per cent, but their exact volume was 
unavailable. 
  Foreign-funded firms in Beijing exported goods worth $40 
million in January, 31 per cent of the city's total. 
  And barter trade, mainly with the former Soviet republics, 
increased 78 per cent to $4.23 million, municipal officials said. 
  State-run trading companies, the mainstay of the capital's 
foreign business, increased their exports by 68 per cent. 
  These corporations export goods such as grain, silk, arts 
and 
crafts, and chemicals. 
  Exports from the country's State run enterprises, including 
those in Beijing, shrank last year because of the sluggish 
international market. 
  Most of them turned their attention to more profitable 
domestic business as the national economy grew 13 per cent over 
1992. 
  Analysts said the unification of the foreign exchange rates 
on January 1, which formally devalued the yuan, might help 
exports recover. 
  But it was too early to say whether Beijing, or the rest of 
the country, could sustain the export momentum. 
  "We have to wait and see whether the current foreign 
exchange 
rate will remain stable for the whole year," said an expert who 
asked not to be named. 
  "If the yuan is further devalued as inflation soars, the 
exporters might face prohibitive purchase prices at home and a 
demand from foreign importers to slash export prices."

(0719 3185): "Pollution From Coal Burning Brings About Social 
Catastrophe; 30,000 People Live in Affected Areas"] 
  [Text] Qianxinan Autonomous Prefecture is an area that is 
rarely seen in the world in terms of frequent cases of arsenical 
poisoning caused by pollution from burning coal; the affected 
areas have a population of more than 30,000. In the areas 
affected by arsenical poisoning, the incidences of ascites due 
to cirrhosis, skin cancer, and lung cancer are very high. 
Patients suffering from chronic arsenical poisoning mainly live 
in Jiaole Village (formerly Jiaole Township), Yuzhang Town, 
Xingren County; and Dadi Village, Bayou Village, and Xiaogeduo 
Village under Xingyi City; as well as Anlong County's Haizi 
Township and Getang Town. The incidence of disease in Xingyi 
City and Xingren County has reached 17.28 percent, whereas in 
Anlong County a new affected area was discovered in the second 
half of 1993, and experts estimated that the incidence of 
disease there would surpass 17.28 percent. 
  Over the past few years, governments at various levels and 
the relevant departments have adopted measures time and again: 
Closing down some coal pits, banning coal mining in some 
districts, distributing medicine to people, and modifying their 
cooking stoves, thereby controlling arsenical poisoning to 
certain extent. However, the problem is still a very serious, 
as well as urgent one, which merits further attention from the 
authorities and various quarters of society.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 15 (AFP)--China is to publish a 
Dictionary of Deng Xiaoping Thought and Theory to help shed 
light on the works of the country's 89-year-old patriarch, it 
was reported Tuesday. 
  The dictionary, recently completed by the Shanghai 
Publishing 
House, includes technical terms, essays, theories and documents 
on subjects ranging from philosophy to education, politics to 
culture, economics to diplomacy, military affairs to technology, 
the Beijing Evening News said. 
  It did not say whether the dictionary would include a 
definition of the "socialist market economy." Officials have as 
yet failed to come up with a meaningful explanation of the term, 
coined by Deng to describe his vision for China's future and 
enshrined last year in the constitution. 
  The news of the dictionary comes as concern grows over 
Deng's 
failing health after he looked frail, emaciated and dazed last 
week in his first television appearance in a year. 
  The newspaper gave no date for the publication of the 
dictionary.

  [Excerpts] Provincial party, government, and military 
leaders solemnly gathered at a Lunar New Year tea party in 
Chengdu's Jinliu Hotel this morning. Zhu Rongji, member of the 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and 
vice premier of the State Council, attended the tea party and 
extended festival greetings to the Sichuan people. 
  The tea party was attended by more than 430 people, 
including 
such provincial party, government, and military leaders as Xie 
Shijie [secretary of the provincial party committee], Xiao Yang

provincial people's congress standing committee], Nie Ronggui 
[chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)], and people of all

concerned. [passage omitted] 
  Secretary Xie Shijie presided over and delivered a speech at 
the tea party, saying: Today, we have gathered here happily to 
observe the Lunar New Year Festival with Comrade Zhu Rongji, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing 
Committee and vice premier of the State Council. Over the past

  Governor Xiao Yang also delivered a speech at the tea party, 
saying: Comrades and friends, today provincial party, 
government, and military leaders, as well as representatives of 
the people of all walks of life in Sichuan, have gathered 
happily at this tea party to jointly observe the traditional 
Lunar New Year Festival. We are especially happy that Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji and some state ministry and commission 
leaders also are present at this tea party and have joined the 
Sichuan people in celebrating the Lunar New Year Festival. This 
has demonstrated that the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council have been greatly concerned with Sichuan. On behalf of 
the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and the Sichuan Provincial 
People's Government, I would like to take this opportunity to 
extend warmest New Year greetings to Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and 
to all the state ministry and commission leaders here present, 
and to wish them a happy Lunar New Year, good health, and good 
work. I also would like to extend Lunar New Year greetings to 
the Sichuan people and the Sichuan-based PLA units. 
  In his speech, Governor Xiao Yang recalled some major steps 
taken and some important achievements scored by the people of 
all nationalities in Sichuan under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and of the party's basic line over the past 
year, saying that the Sichuan people have successfully seized 
each and every excellent opportunity to deepen reform and expand 
opening up, pushed forward economic and social growth in an 
expeditious manner; and successfully built a socialist market 
economic structure. After expounding on a series of major tasks 
and goals set for the year 1994, Governor Xiao Yang concluded 
his speech by saying: The new year 1994 is one full of 
opportunities, challenges, and hopes. Let us unite more closely 
and join the people of all nationalities in Sichuan in carrying 
out down-to-earth work, bravely making explorations and forging 
ahead, making more progress, and striving for a brighter future 
under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin as the core! 
  Lieutenant General Zhang Zhijian, political commissar of the 
Chengdu Military Region, also spoke at the tea party, extending 
Lunar New Year greetings to the party and government leaders of 
Sichuan Province and the city of Chengdu, to people of all 
nationalities who have been diligently working on various fronts 
in Sichuan, to the families of glorious revolutionary martyrs, 
and to both soldiers and demobilized soldiers who have been 
transferred to civilian work. 
  Comrade Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau Standing Committee and vice premier of the 
State Council, delivered a speech at the tea party. He said: 
Comrades, Happy Lunar New Year! I am very pleased today to 
attend the 1994 Sichuan Provincial Lunar New Year Tea Party. I 
would like to take this opportunity to extend -- on behalf of 
the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the leaders of 
State Council departments who have come with me to Sichuan -- 
festival greetings to the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and 
People's Government; to the leaders of all party, government, 
military, and mass organizations who are present at the tea 
party; to veteran comrades who have made enormous contributions 
in different historical periods; and to all PLA officers and 
soldiers, as well as the Sichuan people! I wish all of you 
happy Lunar New Year! I also wish all of you good health, good 
work, and happy family! 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji went on: In 1993, guided by Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, Sichuan forged ahead energetically and scored 
phenomenal achievements on all fronts. Last year, Sichuan not 
only witnessed fast-paced national economic growth, but also 
handled properly the relations between reform, development, and 
stability to a certain extent, thus conforming with both the 
work principles formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the 
overall national interests. The CPC Central Committee has 
called for seizing each and every excellent opportunity to 
deepen reform, expand opening up, push ahead with development, 
and maintain stability. Sichuan's enormous achievements have 
been fully affirmed by all the State Council department leaders 
who have come with me to Sichuan this time. After going back to 
Beijing, we will study conscientiously the demands you have 
raised this time, and will take practical steps to help you 
resolve problems. I believe that led by the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and by the 
Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and People's Government as 
well, the Sichuan people surely will be able to score greater 
achievements in the year 1994! I wish all the comrades present 
at this tea party good health! Thank you! 
  A number of excellent entertainment performances were staged 
at the Lunar New Year tea party.

  [Text] On the morning of 10 February, more than 2,000 
people of the military region gathered happily at Bayi 
Auditorium to attend the Spring Festival gathering and 
celebrations for organs of the military region. 
  Leading comrades of the military region and of organs of the 
military region, including Zhang Taiheng, Song Qingwei, and 
veteran leaders of the military region, zealously celebrated the 
Spring Festival and spent the festive day along with the people. 
  Political Commissar Song Qingwei presided over this 
gathering 
and Commander Zhang Taiheng addressed it. First of all, he 
wished a happy Spring Festival to veteran leaders of the 
military region, and to all cadres, soldiers, workers, and staff 
families of organs and subordinate units of the military region, 
and extended festive greetings and cordial regards to comrades 
on behalf of the standing committee of the party committee of 
the military region. 
  He said: The past year was one during which the officers and 
men at the higher and the lower level throughout the military 
region worked with one heart and one mind, exerted vigorous 
efforts to forge ahead, and won greater progress in 
comprehensively building the Army. The whole Army was full of 
vigor and vitality. We should attributed all this to the 
regular hard work of the officers and men throughout the 
military region. This year, the work tasks of Army building 
will be heavier and more arduous. We should strive to meet the 
demands of the new situation, actively strengthen the 
self-development of various organs, realistically turn them into 
a group of leading organs with a strong political sense, good 
professional skills, solid work style, and high working 
efficiency, lead the Army units across the military region to 
comprehensively implement Chairman Jiang's proposal of building 
the Army into a politically qualified Army with a perfect 
mastery of military skills, strict discipline, and good work 
style that can defend the country effectively, and successfully 
fulfill all tasks entrusted by the higher level. 
  Commander Zhang Taiheng called on commanders and fighters 
across the military region to work with one heart and one mind, 
engage in arduous struggle, actively seek new development in 
Army building, and strive to create a new situation in building 
the Army under the correct leadership of the party Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang 
  Zemin as the nucleus and the Central Military Commission. 
  Colorful large-scale Spring Festival celebrations were held 
after the gathering.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yongli (3769 3057 7787): "One Month After the New </F>
Taxation System Comes Into Effect"] 
  [Text] During the first collection of tax under the new 
taxation system, one month after the new system came into 
effect, this reporter contacted some enterprises and interviewed 
Jin Xin, director of the State General Administration of 
Taxation and some officials from grass-roots tax offices. 
<H5>  Taxpayers Support Taxation System Reform </H5>
  After meeting the directors, managers, and tax personnel 
from 
some enterprises, especially large and medium enterprises, this 
reporter's overwhelming impression was that they are good at 
accounts and have a detailed understanding of the reform of the 
taxation system, especially value-added tax [VAT]. 
  Xu Shizhen, chief accountant at the Beijing Electrical 
Machinery Plant, said: This reform is a positive one and 
constitutes a major measure for bringing the socialist market 
economy in line with the international market. As VAT will not 
lead to duplicate taxation in the links of social reproduction, 
it enhances coordination among specialized departments. It also 
encourages direct export because the export tax rate is zero. 
The electrical machinery plant has the right to export its own 
products. Xu Shizhen estimated that exports would increase this 
year. In the course of implementing the new taxation system, 
the plant has also issued two documents to the appropriate 
personnel: "The Handling of Accounts After the New Taxation 
Comes Into Effect" and "The Points of Attention in Writing 
Receipts and Accepting Receipts From Outside." 
  To adapt enterprises' internal operations to the unified VAT 
special receipts, the Beijing Municipal Department Store and the 
Beijing Municipal Medical Corporation hurriedly printed vouchers 
for internal delivery in late December last year. Foregoing the 
New Year's Day holiday, the Beijing Municipal Mechanical and 
Electrical Corporation carried out advance on-the-spot exercises 
on the method of using VAT special receipts and rushed to made 
seals in coordination with the use of special receipts so as to 
reduce customers' waiting time. In implementing the new 
taxation system, the nine branch factories and one company of 
the Guizhou Organic Chemical Plant have taken the headquarters 
as a unified tax-paying unit and, with some subordinate 
enterprises undertaking more or less tax burdens, the overall 
tax burden has dropped. In light of the rising prices of raw 
and semi-finished materials and the increasing enterprise tax 
burden, the plant has worked out several measures for tapping 
its internal potential. Because it uses bauxite as a raw 
material, the China No. 7 Abrasive Wheel Plant cannot enjoy tax 
credits and hence has to assume a heavier tax burden. The 
plant's chief accountant, Ma Quanbin, said: The introduction of 
the new taxation system has vigorously compelled us to change 
our internal operation mechanism and adapt to the market 
economy. We should budget carefully, raise efficiency by 
improving management, and try every possible means to internally 
absorb the increased tax burden. 
<H5>  Good Order in the First Tax Collection Period </H5>
  The first collection of tax according to the new taxation 
system covers a 10-day period from 1 to 10 February. 
  At the No. 1 tax office of the Dongcheng tax sub-bureau of 
the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau, this reporter discovered that 
most enterprises filled in the "VAT Returns" and other forms in 
pencil first and, after consulting those individuals 
specifically assigned to the task of checking them, officially 
filled in the forms. As these individuals asked questions and 
made calculations column by column and item by item, everything 
was in good order. The No. 4 tax office of the Chaoyang tax 
sub-bureau of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau, which is 
responsible for over 200 large and medium city- level 
enterprises, extended its working hours lest enterprises should 
require a second consultation. They also stipulated that 
administrative personnel should first give guidance on how to 
fill in all forms and then check them before they are submitted 
to the tax collection department, the information is entered in 
the computer, and the tax invoices are printed. This can 
prevent enterprises from making mistakes or enduring long 
waiting periods to submit returns. 
  It has been learned that during the first tax collection 
period under the new taxation system, the order of paying taxes 
has been good in most parts of the country. 
<H5>  Taking the First Steady Step </H5>
  Jin Xin, director of the State General Administration of 
Taxation, said: There are four conditions for judging whether 
the taxation system reform has been successful: First, whether 
it will give rise to price fluctuations and soaring prices; 
second, whether tax revenue can grow steadily; third, whether 
there are numerous counterfeit VAT special receipts and tax 
evasions in violation of regulations on the use of special 
receipts; and fourth, whether the new taxation system boosts the 
transformation of enterprise operational mechanisms and 
production. Judging from the first month, the taxation system 
reform has not given rise to great fluctuations in commodity 
prices, about which people are most concerned; there have not 
been major problems in the use of VAT special receipts; the tax 
revenue maintained a fairly high growth in January; and some 
localities are exploring economic development strategies to 
adapt to the new taxation system and some enterprises are 
readjusting their internal operation mechanisms. Due to its 
vast territory, conditions differ greatly throughout China, and 
all trades and professions have their own special features. 
Given such disparate conditions, many complicated issues have 
yet to be solved in the implementation of a unified taxation 
system. However, through the vigorous coordination of various 
quarters and the joint efforts of both tax departments and 
enterprises, we have taken a steady first step in implementing a 
new taxation system which contributes to the sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development [as published] of the national economy, 
meets the requirements of the socialist market economic 
structure, and conforms to international practice and our 
national conditions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Lu Rongjing Holds Discussion With </F>
Representatives to Political and Legal Work Conference, Calls On 
All Levels of Party Committees To Stress and Study New Situation 
in Political and Legal Work and To Place Emphasis on the 
Character of `Enhancement'"] 
  [Text] The three-day meeting of the provincial political 
and legal work conference ended in Hefei on the afternoon of 30 
January. Lu Rongjing, secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC 
Committee, held discussions with some of the representatives to 
the meeting prior to the conclusion of the meeting. 
  The forum was presided over by Yang Yongliang, deputy 
secretary of the provincial CPC committee. Following the 
briefings presented by representatives from Sixian County, 
Fuyang Prefecture, and Wuhu city on current political and legal 
work, Lu Rongjing delivered a speech in which he emphasized the 
need for various levels of party committees to enhance in a 
down-to-earth manner political and legal work in the new 
situation. 
  Lu Rongjing said it is necessary to seriously study 
political 
and legal work, which are confronted by new conditions and new 
issues in the new situation, and to pay attention to exploring a 
pattern for political and legal work. Increasing economic 
activities and an increasing flow of people have created 
opportunities for criminal elements whose sole purpose is to rip 
people off. Touching on the policy of "promoting the reform and 
opening drive with one hand and cracking down on severe crimes 
with the other," Lu Rongjing noted that some localities and some 
comrades have still been unable to properly put theory into 
practice; they have failed to crack down really hard on 
criminals. Some localities are weak in grass-roots work and 
fail to do a good job in the comprehensive management of social 
order, which create loopholes in social order work. Problems in 
the readjusted relationship between interests brought about by 
reform and increases in the number of ideological and 
work-related problems could produce new contradictions if they 
are not properly dealt with. Generally speaking, the quality of 
the contingent of political and legal workers is good. But in 
ideology, in work, and in work style, there still are areas 
which have not adapted to the needs of the times. All levels of 
party committees and political and legal departments must remain 
sober-minded. To be sure, they should be aware of the excellent 
situation in the current efforts to deepen reform and to 
accelerate development, but they should also make full 
preparations to cope with factors of instability, to formulate 
good countermeasures in advance according to changes in the 
situation, to maintain political stability using all possible 
means, and to help to ensure the smooth progress of reform, 
opening up, and modernization construction. 
  Lu Rongjing said that to strengthen the political and legal 
work in the new situation, it is necessary to persist in the 
policy of a "two-handed approach" and to use Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics to unify our thinking and to guide our actions. 
We need to get really serious about the "two-handed approach." 
We should, on the one hand, stress the building of material 
civilization, and on the other hand, we should emphasize the 
building of spiritual civilization. While persisting in the 
policy of a "severe crackdown," we should step up efforts to 
enhance the comprehensive management of social order; namely, we 
should deal with the root cause and symptoms of crime at the 
same time. While making efforts to improve the greater social 
environment, we should strive for personal improvement. It is 
necessary to stress grass-roots work. The macro- and 
micro-level relationship should be handled correctly. It is 
also necessary to stress building a legal system on the one hand 
and to emphasize building up organizations on the other. 
  Lu Rongjing used the two Chinese characters "jia qiang" 
[enhancement] to emphasize the need for the party committee to 
strengthen leadership over political and legal work. He urged 
all levels of party committees to do a good in the following 
areas: first, enhance leadership of political and legal cadres 
in their theoretical study, and use theory to arm them and help 
them increase their understanding of the importance of political 
and legal work. Second, enhance investigation and study; analyze 
the state of political and legal work in localities; formulate 
problem-solving measures; and improve work. Third, devote more 
efforts to political and legal work and adopt a comprehensive 
view on political and legal work. Fourth, show concern for 
cadres involved in political and legal work; support them 
ideologically; give them support in work; help them to solve 
practical difficulties in daily life; and help political and 
legal departments solve difficulties encountered in enforcing 
the law. Fifth, improve the management and education of 
political and legal cadres and constantly raise the overall 
quality of those involved in political and legal work. It is 
necessary to seriously treat and deal with problems that exist 
among those who are involved in political and legal work. We 
must be resolute in removing a small minority of people who are 
not adapted to the work of political and legal departments. 
  When coming to the issue of giving full play to the 
functions 
and roles of political and legal departments, Lu Rongjing 
pointed out that the political and legal committee is entrusted 
by the party committee with taking charge of political and legal 
work. In addition to fulfilling the primary task of 
implementing the party's principles and policy on political and 
legal work, the other tasks of the political and legal committee 
include doing a good job of organization and coordination in the 
day-to-day work of the political and legal system as stipulated 
by the law; supervising and checking matters related to law 
enforcement according to the law; carrying out massive amounts 
of investigative and study work; and helping party committees to 
manage cadres working in the political and legal departments. 
At present, priority should be given to doing a good job in 
building up the contingent of political and legal workers and in 
building up grass-roots organizations. It is also of great 
importance to stress the building up of leading bodies at 
various levels of political and legal departments. 
  Fu Xishou, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC committee 
and Anhui governor, who is now inspecting work outside the 
province, sent a written message to the forum. He called on all 
levels of party committees and governments to voluntarily put 
political and legal work at the top of the agenda, to help 
safeguard social stability, and to maintain by every possible 
means the current excellent momentum of development in our 
province. Fu Xishou stressed the need for all levels of 
government to attach importance to helping political and legal 
departments solve funding difficulties.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 11 (XINHUA) -- Xie Fei, 
secretary of Guangdong provincial Communist Party committee, 
today visited resettled farmers in Shantang town in Qingxin 
County. 
  Lying 80 kilometers north of Guangzhou city, capital of 
Guangdong Province, Shantang town received 130 households with 
more than 600 people who were moved from limestone mountain 
areas in Qingyuan city. 
  Xie Fei, also a member of the party's Politburo, visited 
Chen 
Quangui's house and gave spring festival greetings to the family. 
  Chen told the local party chief that in the second half of 
last year, when his family was moved to the new village, his 
family had reaped 5,000 kilograms of rice, three times more than 
the harvest in the past three years. 
  He said that his family sold about 2,000 kilograms of rice 
for and 1,400 yuan. 
  Xie Fei then visited six families in the town and he was 
pleased to see that more than 100 new houses for resettled 
people were under construction. 
  Xie said that Guangdong has set a target of modernization in 
the next 20 years. But the limestone mountain areas presented a 
problem -- their barren conditions made them unfit for people. 
  So Guangdong provincial government decied to resettle about 
100,000 people from the mountain areas to the outskirts of 
Guangzhou city, including the counties of Qingyuan city, where 
there is more farmland with fewer farmers. 
  Last year, about 5,700 households with more than 30,000 
people were moved from the limestone mountain areas to the 
counties of Qingyuan city. 
  Xie Fei urged the resettled farmers to open up the potential 
in agriculture and gradually get prosperous.

  [Text] Vienna, February 15 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today agreed to open seven 
sites of nuclear facilities to the inspection of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  A DPRK representative today informed the IAEA that the DPRK 
"accepts the inspection activities ...[ellipses as received] 
requested by the IAEA in the seven declared nuclear facilities" 
after months of negotiations, said David Kyd, spokesman for the 
Vienna-based IAEA. 
  He said that the IAEA would send an inspection team of six 
or 
seven experts to the DPRK as soon as possible. 
  The team is expected to stay in that country for three weeks 
and verify whether there has been any diversion of nuclear 
fissionable materials into military use in those facilities 
since the IAEA's last inspection in February 1993. 
  It was reported that the IAEA had formally requested to 
inspect the seven facilities in January this year. 
  Suspecting that the DPRK is using the facilities to develop 
nuclear weapons, the United States has threatened that country 
with sanctions and with stationing "Patriot" anti-missile 
missiles in South Korea. 
  But the DPRK has forcefully denied any manufacture of 
nuclear 
weapons.

  [Text] Seoul, February 16 (XINHUA) -- South Korea welcomed 
Wednesday [16 February] the agreement reached between the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on reopening nuclear 
inspections. 
  "The agreement is the result of close consultation and 
coordination between South Korea and the international 
community," said a Foreign Ministry official. 
  The DPRK agreed to allow the IAEA to conduct inspections on 
all seven reported nuclear facilities at a working-level contact 
in Vienna Tuesday. 
  But the question of inspecting two unreported nuclear 
facilities is still pending, presumably for the two sides to 
discuss later, according to reports reaching here Wednesday. 
  The two sides reached the agreement after two months of 
see-saw negotiations to resume inspections which was stalled 
since February last year. 
  The South Korean official said that since the agreement 
"leaves unsettled the question of special inspections of two 
major suspected sites, the international community will continue 
its efforts to resolve this matter." 
  The IAEA is expected to send a team of inspectors to 
Pyongyang before February 21, the date on which the IAEA 
convenes a board of governors meeting. 
  Meanwhile, the DPRK and the United States reportedly resumed 
working level meeting in New York Tuesday to negotiate follow-up 
measures on IAEA inspections.

  [Text] Washington, February 15 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States welcomes an agreement by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK) to allow the IAEA inspect DPRK's nuclear facilities. 
  "We look forward to the beginning of these inspections as 
soon as possible," said Mike McCurry, spokesman for the State 
Department, at a regular news briefing. 
  The IAEA, a U.N. organization based in Vienna, announced 
today that the DPRK has accepted the inspection activities 
requested by the IAEA in its seven declared nuclear facilities. 
  The inspectors will take certain measures, such as reloading 
of cameras and changing of seals to facilitate future 
verification, the IAEA said in a statement. 
  The aim of those inspection activities is to verify that the 
nuclear material in the facilities has not been diverted since 
their earlier inspections, the statement said. 
  "It is a necessary step for the IAEA to be able to reassure 
the international community that there has been no diversion of 
nuclear material from that facility," McCurry said. 
  The spokesman also said that "satisfactory completion of the 
inspection at the earliest possible date and resumption of the 
North-South dialogue on de-nuclearization will pave the way for 
the next round of U.S.-North Korea talks." 
  A meeting between the U.S. and the DPRK is likely to be held 
in New York this week, McCurry added.

  [Text] Washington, February 15 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. 
congressman will visit Pyongyang this week at the invitation of 
the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK). 
  Representative Ronald Dellums, a California Democrat and the 
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, hoped to help 
defuse the dispute over the alleged DPRK's nuclear weapon 
programs, according to the NEW YORK TIMES. 
  The newspaper quoted U.S. Administration officials as saying 
that the White House has approved the visit, which is a secretly 
arranged trip. 
  He is expected to meet with the DPRK leader Kim Il-song and 
his top advisers, the newspaper said.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "After Cellular Phones, What's </F>
Next in U.S.-Japan Trade?"] 
  [Text] Washington, February 15 (XINHUA) -- Compared with 
the huge trans-Pacific trade between the U.S. and Japan, selling 
a cellular phone, or 12,900 of them by Motorola Inc., is like a 
drop of water in the ocean. 
  It is not so, said the U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor. "This is an extremely important issue that goes to the 
heart of this administration," he told a packed press conference 
this afternoon. 
  After the failed summit last Friday [11 February], when 
President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa failed to agree on a trade framework, cellular phones, 
for the U.S., show how difficult it is to enter the Japanese 
market. 
  Accusing Tokyo of violating a 1989 agreement to buy more 
U.S.-made cellular phones, Washington hinted today at trade 
sanctions against Japan, whose trade surplus with the U.S. 
surpassed 60 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. 
  "The Japanese Government created a situation favoring 
existing Japanese suppliers over any potential U.S. competitor," 
Christopher Galvin, Motorola's president, told a press 
conference following Kantor's announcement. 
  For President Clinton, the issue of cellular phone was 
"illustrative of our general problems" with Japan. Motorola, 
with leading edge in cellular phone technologies, sells 40 
percent of such phones in the world. 
  In 1989, Japan agreed to let U.S.-made cellular phones enter 
its domestic markets, and the share in Japan's market by the 
Schaumberg, Illinois-based Motorola is supposed to reach one 
third to 50 percent by February 15, 1994. 
  "Despite an accord with Japan that was designed to open the 
cellular telephone markets, we still find ourselves struggling 
to gain access to Japanese market," Galvin said. 
  The issue of cellular phones has nothing to do with the 
trade 
framework talks between U.S. and Japan, although it coincided 
with the summit, whose failure is the first of its kind since 
the end of the second world war. 
  During the eight-month old trade talks, U.S. asked to set 
numerical standards to evaluate the open nature of the Japanese 
market. Naming it managed trade, Tokyo said no and withdrew 
from the talks. 
  The Americans are especially angry at the difficulty to 
enter 
Japan's markets of telecommunications, medical equipment, auto 
and auto parts, and insurance services, the four priority areas 
in the framework talks. 
  Noting that some Japanese officials blamed the lack of 
competitiveness as a reason for limited success of foreign 
producers in Japan, Kantor called the excuse "false and 
disingenuous." 
  Administration officials refused to anticipate if a full 
scale trade war with Japan is in breed, given the fact that such 
a conflict will impact not only Japanese companies but also 
American firms since the two countries are inextricably tied 
together in economies. 
  "We are doing a thorough evaluation. We are moving with our 
deliberate speeds on this issue," said Commerce Secretary Ron 
Brown. 
  He said recent comments by the administration are "very 
serious" and are not threatening words. "We're going to be 
consistent and insistent that American products, goods and 
services have an opportunity to compete fairly in Japanese 
markets." 
  Observers, meanwhile, listed many options facing the Clinton 
administration, including the revival of the Super 301 Trade 
Law, which asks the government to review unfair trade practices 
by foreign countries on an annual basis and impose sanctions in 
designated time. 
  President Clinton is reportedly going to issue an executive 
order this week to revive the trade law, which, in the late 
1980's, was used to pry open Japan's markets of super computer, 
satellite and timber products. 
  The U.S. also intends to target the American affiliates of 
Japanese firms, some of which are accused of violating the 
anti-trust laws in the country, and to eye the European Union 
for multilateral approach in pressing Japan for move concessions 
in trade. 
  "We have a number of options in order to make sure we open 
markets in Japan. That's our goal," Kantor said. "All we are 
asking is for two-way street."

  [Text] Madrid, February 15 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez today urged NATO to refrain from launching air 
strikes against Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo, 
stressing that a settlement of the crisis could be found through 
peaceful means. 
  "Reconciliation dialogue" was the best way to ensure the 
withdrawal of Serb heavy weapons from around Sarajevo in an 
effort to end the siege of the city, Gonzalez said after talks 
with visiting Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has threatened 
to launch air strikes against the Serbs' positions around 
Sarajevo if they fail to withdraw their heavy weapons from 
around the city by midnight GMT on Sunday [20 February]. 
  The Hungarian president shared the view of Gonzalez. He told 
reporters upon arrival here that "every effort should be exerted 
to defuse the crisis without resorting to air strikes." 
  Also today, Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas 
said Spain favored diplomatic efforts to end the siege of 
Sarajevo, instead of the use of force as proposed by NATO. 
  He was speaking after returning from France where he had 
consulted with French officials on the Bosnian crisis. 
  The Bosnian Serbs have been under mounting international 
pressure to withdraw their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo 
since a mortar attack killed 68 civilians and wounded nearly 200 
others in the city earlier this month. 
  The Muslims accused the Serbs of launching the attack, a 
charge the Serbs denied.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 15 (XINHUA) -- Greece has raised 
a new proposal for avoiding NATO air strikes on Serbian 
positions around Sarajevo. 
  Visiting Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias told 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic today that the proposal 
includes two points: To demilitarize Sarajevo and put it under 
U.N. mandate for two years; and to press the Muslim side to 
accept the European Union peace plan which divides Bosnia into 
three ethnic states. 
  Milosevic and Papoulias agreed that any air strike on 
Serbian 
positions will undermine the Bosnian peace talks and will only 
encourage what they called "militants" to continue to refuse 
peace and prolong the war. 
  Papoulias also handed over a letter from Greek Prime 
Minister 
Andreas Papandreou to Milosevic. 
  Greece was the only NATO member country to oppose issuing an 
ultimatum to the warring Bosnian sides to remove their weapons 
from around Sarajevo at the NATO meeting last Wednesday [9 
February] in Brussels. 
  Papoulias promised to do his best, while serving as the 
chairman of the European Union's ministerial meeting, to avoid 
the worst -- air strikes. 
  He said air strikes will not help bring about peace in 
Bosnia, and a political settlement will benefit not only the 
Balkans, but also the whole of Europe. 
  It is not fair to only ask the Serbian side to withdraw 
weapons from around Sarajevo, he said, adding that the Muslim 
side should also be pressed to withdraw their weapons.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zhang Tiegang: "Major's Moscow Visit Bolsters </F>
Anglo-Russian Ties"] 
  [Text] Moscow, February 15 (XINHUA) -- British Prime 
Minister John Major's three-day official visit to Russia has 
helped push Anglo-Russian relations to the "highest level" in 
decades. 
  This conviction was shared by Major and Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  Major arrived in the Russian capital on Monday [14 February] 
night on his first-ever visit to the country. His talks with 
Yeltsin on Tuesday resulted in the signing of a package of 
documents and agreements on international issues. 
  Among the accords, the most important is an "unprecedented" 
statement on reciprocal non-targeting of strategic nuclear 
missiles no later than May 30, 1994. The statement envisages 
everyday control over Russian and British nuclear forces. 
  The two leaders also reached an essential agreement on joint 
military exercises starting from 1995 to increase their armed 
forces' capability "for interaction in peacekeeping operations." 
  Details of further military cooperation between the two 
sides 
were discussed by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd behind closed doors. 
  Moreover, Hurd and his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev 
signed an accord on cooperation in education, science and 
culture. They also signed a convention against double taxation 
to cement the basis of Russian-British economic relations. 
  According to official sources here, Britain was the third 
largest trade partner with Russia in 1993, when a trade volume 
of 2.8 billion U.S. dollars was registered. 
  Major also met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin to discuss further developing trade and economic 
relations. 
  Summing up the results of their talks in the Kremlin, both 
Major and Yeltsin told reporters that they held identical views 
on certain international issues, the Bosnian crisis in 
particular. 
  Major said he found "no major contradictions" with the 
Russian leader on the Bosnian problem and both leaders were 
committed to a peaceful settlement of the conflict. 
  Major said he and Yeltsin also agreed on the necessity to 
place under U.N. control the heavy weapons of the warring 
parties around Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  But major pointed to Russia's "certain misunderstanding of 
the essence of the NATO decision" to unleash air strikes against 
the Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo if the Serbs fail to 
withdraw their heavy weapons from around the city by midnight 
GMT on Sunday. 
  Yeltsin told reporters, "Our stands are identical on the 
main 
point -- it is necessary to hand over to the U.N. forces the 
heavy guns deployed around Sarajevo. This measure will allow us 
to stop the shelling of that city." 
  However, the Russian president stressed, "Some people are 
trying to solve the problems of Bosnia without Russia. We shall 
not allow this to happen." 
  Diplomats here said other topics discussed by Major and 
Yeltsin were Russia's "interaction" with the Group of Seven 
industrialized countries and the European Union and Moscow's 
relations with the Baltic nations. 
  Major will leave Moscow for Nizhniy Novgorod, a major 
Russian 
city on the Volga, on Wednesday and from there he will depart 
for London later in the day.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yu Haisheng (0060 3189 3932) and Wen Jihua </F>
(2429 4949 5478)] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 12 Feb (XINHUA) -- While the Chinese 
people were joyously celebrating the Spring Festival, diplomats 
in Beijing's consular district were also sharing their holiday 
joy. 
  There is still a chill in the air of Beijing in February, 
but 
the Friendship Palace of the Friendship Guesthouse is full of 
spring. On the stage, students from the Central University of 
Nationalities were displaying costumes and styles of China's 
minority nationalities. [passage omitted] Among the audience, 
Israeli Ambassador to China Ya'agov praised: "It's so beautiful! 
The long history and splendid culture of China are 
intoxicating." 
  It seems that China's achievements have even more impressed 
the ambassador who has been here for a half year. He said: "I 
am not long in China, but everything in China, particularly her 
progress over these years, has surprised me." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The "Sinologue" "No Longer Recognizes China" </H5>
  Speaking on China, Russian Ambassador to China Rogachev, who 
has enjoyed the nickname of "Sinologue," looked a little 
excited. He said: Since the founding of China, particularly 
since the 1980's, China has changed so greatly that "I can 
hardly recognize her." [passage omitted] 
  Rogachev said the greatest changes in China over these years 
can be seen in people's attitudes, words, and behavior. He 
said: "They are all very busy and have their own goals; they are 
very optimistic, which is obviously the result of continuous 
improvement in living standards." 
<H5>  The Practical "New Generation" </H5>
  Cheerful Cuban Ambassador to China Guerra maintained that 
China's development over the decade or so is a "miracle." 
  Guerra paid his first visit to China in 1967, when the 
"Cultural Revolution" was in progress. At that time, he said, 
"People wore the same style of clothes, spoke, and behaved 
almost identically; one could hardly tell who was man and who 
was woman." 
  When he returned to Beijing in 1988, he found that Beijing 
had "completely changed." People's clothes have turned from 
dull blue, grey, and green to distinct colors; the wide streets, 
skyscrapers, and incessant flow of traffic all display the 
city's vitality. 
  From ordinary people's daily activities and codes of 
conduct, 
Guerra concluded: The most profound change in China is the 
renewal of people's thinking -- the emergence of "a practical 
new generation." 
<H5>  The Large, Attractive Market </H5>
  French Ambassador Presant [name as received] just returned 
from Shenzhen. He had participated in the ceremony for putting 
the No. 1 generator of the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant into 
commercial operation there. In conversations, Presant showed 
his joy for the successful operation of this project. 
  Although he has been in office for one month, he has deeply 
sensed this country's vitality. He said: "Commercial complexes 
stand in Beijing everywhere; the thick commercial air here seems 
to match that in Paris." A two-day tour in Shenzhen allowed him 
to witness an extraordinary development in China. He said: "It 
is hard to imagine that Shenzhen was a small fishing village 15 
years ago!" 
  Speaking on the prospects for economic cooperation, he said: 
The trade volume between France and China accounts for only 1.8 
percent of France's foreign trade; "France's share in the big 
market of China does not match her position in the international 
economy and does not correspond to the potential of both 
countries. Presently, French enterprises in the energy, 
transportation, and telecommunications sectors strongly desire 
to cooperate with China, and the normalization of Franco-Chinese 
relations is good news to these enterprises." 

<H5>    "Difficulties in the Course of Development" </H5>
  The ambassadors have also noticed some difficulties 
confronting China, including transport and energy shortages, 
unbalanced development among regions, the need to readjust the 
industrial structure, and others. 
  "Take transport as an example; nearly one-third of 
Russo-Chinese trade contracts could not be fulfilled in 1993 
because of transport shortages," said Rogachev with regret. 
  As for the gap between eastern and western China, Guerra, 
who 
has inspected both Shanghai and Xinjiang, said: "They are at 
different levels, but they are both advancing. It is like two 
high jumpers -- one jumps to the two-meter mark from his 
starting point at the one-meter mark, whereas the other jumps to 
the four-meter mark from the three-meter mark. In one sense, 
Xinjiang may be undergoing greater change, despite the fact that 
it will still take a long time to catch up with Shanghai." 
  Indian Ambassador to China Dasgupta felt that China needs to 
improve her basic education and occupational training. "As a 
country with a large population, China and India are both facing 
the problem of improving their population quality as quickly as 
possible," otherwise the population will adversely affect their 
"economic development and social progress." 
  Rogachev maintained: "There would be no progress if there 
were no difficulties. China's difficulties are occurring in the 
course of development; she will overcome all kinds of obstacles 
and accomplish greater achievements." 
<H5>  China's Progress Is "A Contribution to World Development" </H5>
  [Passage omitted] Dasgupta maintained: As a country in 
which one-fifth of the world's population lives, China's rapid 
development will produce a profound influence on the whole 
world; it will be "a contribution to world development" and will 
inspire development in other countries. 
  Klara Meszaros is a female ambassador from Hungary; female 
ambassadors have been rare in China. She said in fluent 
Mandarin: "China is a country full of vitality and hope." 
[passage omitted] 
  This female ambassador was infatuated with China's ancient 
civilization, but she obviously showed more concern for China's 
reform. She said: "I am very glad to see China's progress; it 
will benefit the whole world."

  [Text] Washington, February 14 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton sent a 400-page economic report to the U.S. Congress 
today, saying that the U.S. economic expansion looks far 
brighter now than they did a year ago. 
  The economic report of the President, prepared by the 
council 
of economic advisers, forecast the economy will grow 3 percent 
in 1994 and will remain on track to create 8 million jobs in 
four years. 
  In 1993, the economy generated 162,000 new jobs per month, 
twice the 1992 pace. During the bush presidency, fewer than 1 
million new private nonfarm jobs were created, the report said. 
  It also said that consumer spending should remain healthy 
because of continued gains in employment and output, and 
investment spending should remain strong because of low 
long-term interest rates and increasing demand. 
  The annual message from the president to the congress 
represented the first comprehensive exposition of the 
administration's short-term and long-term strategy. 
  The economic report argued that the administration's deficit 
reduction plan has been a major factor in the dramatic decline 
in long-term interest rates. 
  The report also laid out the administration's economic 
rationale for investing in people, technology, defense 
conversion and the environment. 
  Among the other solid signs of economic renewal cited in the 
report are: 
  -- Business investment is surging over 1993. Spending for 
producers' durable equipment has expanded at the fastest pace 
since 1972. 
  -- Housing construction has now clearly begun to accelerate. 
By December, housing starts had reached a 1.54 million annual 
rate, up 25 percent from their July rate. 
  -- Real spending on household durable goods was more than 11 
percent higher than the level of the year earlier in the fourth 
quarter of 1993. 
  -- Inflation rate was just 2.7 percent during 1993, the 
smallest increase since 1986, while the core consumer price 
index, excluding food and energy, increased 3.2 percent, the 
smallest since 1972. 
  -- The factory workweek reached its highest level in the 
post 
war period and overtime was the highest since the 1950s, 
indicating future increases in manufacturing output will be 
coupled with gains in employment.

Successive Years 
  The Clinton administration introduced its budget for fiscal 
year [FY] 1995 (from October 1994 to September 1995) on 7 
February. This is a contracting budget. According to the 
budget, the financial budget for FY1995 will be reduced to 
$176.1 billion through cutting defense expenditures, suspending 
over 100 government undertakings, laying off redundant civil 
servants, and administrative restructuring. The deficit will be 
$100 billion less than estimated by the Bush administration. If 
this plan can be carried through, it will be the first time 
since the Truman administration that the United States has 
succeeded in reducing its deficit for three successive years. 
  The Clinton administration has focused on reforming the 
medical insurance system. If reform can be carried out 
successfully in FY1995, another $11 billion will be saved. 
  According to the Clinton administration's new budget, total 
expenditure in 1995 will be $1.518 trillion, up 2.3 percent over 
the previous year, while the total annual revenue is 1.342 
trillion, up 7.4 percent over the previous year. The increase 
in annual revenue is due to the tax-raising policy introduced 
last year and to increases in tax revenue brought about by 
economic recovery. 
<H5>  The Growth Rate in 1994 is 3.1 Percent </H5>
  Since the Clinton administration's new budget will bring the 
deficit down to $176.1 billion, which is the lowest for the last 
six years, and the unemployment rate will go down slowly due to 
economic recovery, the United States' economic growth for 1994 
and 1995 is estimated to hit 3.1 and 2.8 percent respectively, 
which shows that the U.S. economy is improving. Bill Clinton 
himself maintains that the goal of "a low inflation rate and a 
sustained and steady development of the economy" has been 
attained and he is more confident about future economic 
development. 
  It should be noted that the improvement in some economic 
indicators, such as the improvement in the unemployment and 
inflation rates, began during the Bush administration and have 
become more evident recently. Therefore, we cannot attribute 
all the economic improvement to Clinton, who has only been in 
office for a little more than a year. 
<H5>  Reduced Defense Expenditure in Post-Cold War Period </H5>
  Continued cuts in defense spending in the post-cold war 
period have made it possible for the Clinton administration to 
reduce the deficit and apply itself to revitalizing the economy. 
Total defense expenditure for FY1995 (from October 1994 to 
September 1995) is $263.7 billion, down 0.9 percent from the 
previous year. As a result, the Defense Department reduced its 
existing 1.6 million-strong army by 100,000 and decided to focus 
on improving the quality of national defense by building new 
aircraft carriers and more advanced submarines. 
  Apart from the defense department, 10 of the 14 most 
important departments, including the agriculture, energy, and 
state departments, will slash their administrative expenditures 
according to their actual performance last year, which will 
result in, among other things, the laying off of 118,000 civil 
servants. 
  But the foreign trade deficit cannot be reduced by a big 
margin. The foreign trade deficit for FY1995 is estimated to 
stand at between $135 and $175 billion, and the international 
payments deficit at between $105 and 145 billion, both higher 
than the actual figures for FY1993. What is of top importance 
is how Clinton will carry out reforms in the medical insurance 
system, the result of which is difficult to predict. Reforming 
the old, defective and wasteful medical care system involves the 
immediate interests of the American people. If the government 
cuts subsidies, this will meet great opposition from all 
quarters because smaller government subsidies means bigger 
individual burdens; but if the government gives in, the 
obstinate economic illness will defy a cure. 
  In addition, the government will lay off 252,000 civil 
servants in the next five years. These people, who will become 
jobless, will certainly oppose the Clinton administration's 
austerity policy. Therefore, a number of economists are not 
optimistic about specific reforms to the medical care system. 
It is still too early to say whether the unemployment rate will 
be reduced.

  [Text] Canberra, February 15 (XINHUA) -- The continuing 
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong in the transition to 
Chinese sovereignty are important to Australia, Prime Minister 
Paul Keating told visiting Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten today. 
  During a meeting with Patten in Sydney late this afternoon, 
Keating emphasized the importance of the economic ties between 
Australia and Hong Kong, government sources told XINHUA in a 
phone interview this evening. 
  The talks, lasting for more than one hour, were described by 
sources as friendly. 
  While details about the talks were not provided, sources 
said 
that the two leaders also discussed Hong Kong's role in the Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and regional development 
issues including security. 
  Hong Kong is among Australia's top 10 trading partners and 
has a total Australian investment of over 1.775 billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  Patten, currently on a 7-day visit here, claimed before the 
meeting that he hopes the visit will reinforce the economic and 
trade links between the two sides.

  [Text] Manila, February 11 (XINHUA) -- Senator Blas Ople 
today cautioned against reported move in the House of 
Representatives to review the country's committed one-China 
policy. 
  This could "needlessly complicate our relations with foreign 
countries and even create incidents inimical to our national 
security," said Ople, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
  Ople made the remark in the wake of reports that 97 
congressmen had co-authored a House resolution calling for a 
review of the country's relations with China and Taiwan. 
  The resolution came out just one day after the clandestine 
meeting in Subic of President Fidel Ramos with Taiwanese leader 
Li Teng-hui, for which the Chinese Embassy here had already 
lodged a protest with the Philippine Government saying the 
incident had violated the agreed one-China policy. 
  "The sphere of foreign policy with respect to China and 
Taiwan is fraught with perils and this should be treated with 
great sensitivity, not knee-jerk emotional reactions or rank 
amateurism," Ople said in a statement. 
  He said that "(the House) move will be prone to 
misunderstanding and may cause unintended consequences." 
  He added that the country's political leaders should share 
President Ramos's attitude that friendly relations with China 
should be preserved and nurtured for the sake of the national 
interest. 
  "We want and we seek a mutually advantageous economic 
relationship with Taiwan, and value their cooperation, but this 
should be conducted in a manner consistent with our solemn 
undertakings under the 1975 covenant with China on a policy 
recognizing only one China," he said.

  [Text] Tehran, February 12 (XINHUA) -- Managing director 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) is reported 
to be changed after the IRIB was criticized by the Iranian 
Majles (parliament) since last November. 
  According to the local daily "KAYHAN" today, the IRIB Chief 
Mohammad Hashemi, brother of Iranian President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, has resigned from his post, and Minister of 
Culture and Islamic Guidance 'Ali Larijani would replace him. 
  In a telephone interview with XINHUA, an official from the 
IRIB neither confirmed nor denied the report, saying that only 
the Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i would decide whether the IRIB 
chief will be changed. 
  He said that he did not know if Mohammad Hashemi has given 
his resignation. 
  However, the state-run television tonight reported that 
Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i received Mohammad Hashemi and some 
IRIB directors today, praising the IRIB for its achievement 
during the past years. 
  IRIB has come under criticism for being too liberal. 
  Last November, a committee appointed by the Iranian Majles 
issued a long report, criticizing the IRIB for abusing its 
budget, broadcasting non-Islamic programs, using staff members 
of former shah regime. 
  The report brought out a hot debate between the Majles and 
the IRIB and some IRIB directors were forced to resign. 
  "KAYHAN" also said that Deputy Minister of Culture and 
Islamic Guidance Ahmad Pournajati [spelling of name as received] 
would be caretaker of the ministry before President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani appointed a new minister. 
  The newspaper quoted sources "in some political circles" as 
saying that Kamal Kharrazi [spelling of name as received], the 
top man of Iran's United Nations mission, would be called back 
to head the Guidance Ministry, and would be replaced in New York 
by Hashemi. 
  The aim of the reshuffle is believed here to create a better 
working relationship with the local press.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by staff reporter Liu Shuiming (0941 3055 </F>
2494): "A Positive Step in the Peace Process"] 
  [Text] Cairo, 11 Feb (RENMIN RIBAO) -- Late at night on 9 
February -- just at the beginning of the Islamic Ramadan -- 
'Arafat, chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, and Shimon 
Peres, Israeli minister of foreign affairs, initialed an 
agreement on implementing the principled declaration between 
Palestine and Israel in Cairo (referred to as the "Cairo 
Document" for short). This is another positive step in the 
Palestinian-Israeli peace process following the agreement on 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, which was signed between the two 
sides in Washington last year. 
  The "Cairo Document" was hard-won. As everybody knows, since 
the Palestinian-Israeli Principled Declaration went into effect, 
the two sides have set up four committees responsible for 
holding talks to implement the autonomy accord. Owing to the 
three major obstacles -- control of passage, the Jericho area, 
and security in the settlement sites -- the Palestinian-Israeli 
talks, especially those on troop withdrawal and security 
arrangements, were on and off and almost came to a standstill, 
so that Israel was unable to begin withdrawing its troops as 
scheduled. Over the past few months, Palestinian and Israeli 
leaders took various opportunities to meet in Cairo, Oslo, 
Paris, Grenada, and Davos in a bid to break the stalemate and 
stop dragging on without a solution. Although some progress has 
been made in these meetings, no agreement could be reached 
because of the relatively wide differences between the two sides 
on the above issues. The current Cairo talks also experienced 
hardships and difficulties. It has been learned that President 
Mubarak positively acted as a mediator to help them out of the 
predicament five times in succession, in order to diminish their 
differences and enable the talks to go on. After nine rounds of 
marathon talks, an agreement on a number of crucial issues has 
finally been reached. The initialing of the "Cairo Document" is 
conducive to signing a final agreement between Palestine and 
Israel and will also have a positive impact on pushing forward 
the peace process in the Middle East and making progress in 
other areas. Hence, it has been widely welcomed and seriously 
heeded by public opinion throughout the world. 
  The "Cairo Document," which is more detailed and specific, 
is 
the first document toward the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli principled declaration. It is composed of 
two agreements, which primarily involve the control of border 
passage and security arrangements for the future Palestinian 
autonomous regions. It covers several issues, including the 
general principle on the passage control in Gaza and Jericho, 
the external security during the transition period, the 
supervision of passage control, entry and exit procedures for 
the territory, the examination of passengers, and the 
establishment of a liaison office. Although the "Cairo 
Document" did not resolve all the security problems concerning 
the future autonomous region and the Jewish settlement sites, it 
has removed the major obstacles to the implementation of the 
principled declaration. The signing of the document reflected 
the spirit of trust, cooperation, flexibility, and accommodation 
shown by the two sides. The PLO maintains: "Although the 
"Cairo Document" failed to satisfy all the demands of the 
Palestinian side, generally speaking, it is a good agreement." 
The Israeli side has said that the "Cairo Document" takes its 
security requirements into consideration and does not infringe 
upon the dignity of the Palestinians." 
  Of course, the "Cairo Document" has also met with some 
opposition. For example, Shamir, former leader of the 
ultra-right-wing Likud and prime minister of Israel, called the 
"Cairo Document" an "investment agreement," which, he said, has 
ruined all the "fruits of victory" gained by Israel in the past 
27 years and runs counter to Israel's future, security, and 
interests. 
  The initialing of the "Cairo Document" does not mean that 
the 
Palestinian-Israeli peace train is now on the easy path, given 
the great number of outstanding problems that are awaiting a 
solution between the initialing of the document and the 
conclusion of a final agreement. An example is the actual area 
covered by the Jericho region and the Jewish settlement sites in 
Gaza, which have not been determined up to now. Although 
'Arafat has signed the map that indicates the scope of the 
future Jericho autonomy, he still has some reservations on the 
issue. The Israeli side promised to make its final decision 
during the meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin. Also, the size and 
power of the future Palestinian police and the role of the 
electoral organs of the Palestinian autonomy have not been 
defined, and the detailed rules regarding the transfer of 
administrative power and the economic relations between 
Palestine and Israel still require further negotiations. Even 
though such problems and difficulties exist on the road of 
implementing the Palestinian-Israeli principled declaration, 
they will possibly discover relatively satisfactory ways of 
settlement and achieve the anticipated goals, as long as both 
sides continue to work assiduously for these aims.

<F P=106> [Report by Graham Hutchings in Hong Kong: "Patten Hits at </F>
Asian Leaders Who Oppose Democracy"] 
  [Text] The Governor of Hong Kong, Mr Chris Patten, stepped 
up his battle with Beijing yesterday by attacking opponents of 
democracy and human rights in Asia. 
  Mr Patten said the view that democracy was unsuited to Asian 
societies was patronising and racist. He also described 
communism as "wicked" and "a failure". 
  His remarks will infuriate Beijing, which opposes his plans 
for democratic reform in Hong Kong. 
  Mr Patten, who is visiting Sydney, asked in a speech: "Are 
some Asian leaders really prepared to argue that respect for 
human dignity is an exclusively European or North American or 
Australian concept"? 
  "I don't believe for a moment that human rights stop at the 
borders of Asia, and nor, I believe, do most Asians". 
  "If you argued outside Asia that human rights weren't really 
appropriate for Asians, or for Latin Americans or for Africans, 
that would rightly be regarded as a deeply patronising argument 
-- not to say a racist one." 
  On Sunday, Mr Patten told reporters he would not be using 
his 
visit to Australia to canvass support for his political reform 
plans. He was mainly concerned to promote trade and investment. 
  But following yesterday's remarks, China will see the visit 
as another attempt to internationalise an issue it believes 
should remain a strictly bilateral affair between London and 
Beijing. 
  More to the point, it will regard the Governor's speech as 
an 
attack on its own human rights position, which was restated in 
yesterday's Communist Party newspaper, People's Daily. 
  The paper accused foreign critics of trying to impose alien 
values on China, and of failing to live up to their own lofty 
standards at home. All factors should be taken into account in 
any dialogue on human rights, and the developing world should 
not blindly accept doctrines handed down by the West. 
  "The human rights philosophy of the European capitalist 
revolution has made historical contributions ... but the world 
has gone through great changes, and we should make our choices 
with judgment," People's Daily said. "Outside Europe, there are 
other, even older glorious civilisations with which to compare 
and make choices." 
  Mr Patten said the argument about cultural relativism and 
human rights did not stand up, and denied that those who stood 
up for individual freedoms were interfering in the internal 
affairs of other countries. 
  "The truth is that those who try to sweep human rights under 
the carpet tend to do so for baser motives -- to stamp on 
opposition and keep a tight grip on political power," he said in 
an address to the Australia-Asia Society. 
  "Communism failed because, in attempting to crush initiative 
and suppress individualism, it went right against the grain of 
human nature. It collapsed because of its wicked and expensive 
failures." 
  He dismissed arguments that Asia was barren ground for 
democracy. "First, there is nothing inherent in Asian society 
that makes democracy a non-starter. Japan is evidence enough of 
that". 
  "Second, there is no evidence to support the claim that 
while 
rising living standards in Europe, in Latin America, in Africa, 
may lead to rising political aspirations, the same does not 
apply in Asia". 
  "I accept there may not be a mechanistic relationship 
between 
growing prosperity and an increasing demand for participative 
government. But the evidence is that in Asia, as in other 
places, people who have more in their wallets sooner or later 
want more say in the way they are governed." 
  Mr Patten's remarks amounted to further evidence, if any 
were 
needed, that his approach to problems inside and outside of Hong 
Kong is fundamentally at variance with China's, and that the 
prospects for cooperation between Britain and Beijing over the 
territory seem virtually non-existent.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Chris Patten Exposes His Own Ugliness in His </F>
Trip to Australia"] 
  [Text] Chris Patten will put the first part of his 
constitutional reform package to the vote at the Legislative 
Council [Legco] on 23 February. Yesterday Chris Patten said in 
Australia that the first part of the constitutional package has 
won the support of most Legco members and is expected to be 
passed intact. Meanwhile, the British side announced that, now 
that the first part of the package has been passed, Chris Patten 
will very soon put forward the second part of his constitutional 
reform package "without delay" and push it through in the same 
manner. Chris Patten is seizing the opportunity to step up his 
efforts to bring his ideas into reality and render Hong Kong a 
quasi-independent [ban du li 0584 3747 4539] political entity in 
order to extend British influence in the colony. 
  Before embarking on this political gamble, Chris Patten 
racked his brains to garner public opinion in support of his 
constitutional reform package. He arranged a visit to 
Australia, once again playing the international card. After 
this trip, he will immediately rush back to Hong Kong to push 
through the first part of the constitutional package. It is 
obvious that these activities are two closely linked, 
consecutive steps in a schedule which was meticulously drawn up 
beforehand. 
  In Australia, Chris Patten delivered speeches in a righteous 
tone, declaring that the purpose of his Australian trip is to 
ask the Australian people "to extend assistance to Hong Kong" 
and "to defend the value of democracy." He encouraged Australia 
to "support democracy in Asia," boasted about his constitutional 
reform package, and spoke extravagantly, assuring the Western 
countries that his constitutional package was bound to overcome 
China's objections. He brazenly publicized the relationship 
between his package and the demise of the socialist system and 
fiercely attacked the idea of one country, two systems: "No 
totalitarian regime can coexist peacefully with a free economy 
for any substantial amount of time. The collapse of communism 
and its replacement with the free market offers a lesson to the 
entire world as well as Asia." 
  This remark vividly defines the Far East mission that Chris 
Patten is undertaking in his capacity as the last governor of 
Hong Kong and exposes his real motive in inducing international 
forces to intervene in Hong Kong in support of his 
constitutional reform package -- he wants to resist China's 
resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and opposes the idea of 
"one country, two systems." Chris Patten has openly challenged 
China's sovereignty, as he maintains that it is impossible for 
two systems to coexist peacefully within a country. He has not 
only strongly maligned the Asian countries' successful 
experiences in maintaining a balance between social stability 
and economic prosperity, but he has also slandered socialism as 
a totalitarian system and has pronounced a curse on China, 
saying that the Chinese Government is bound to collapse. Based 
on his mistaken appraisal of the situation, Chris Patten went 
all out to confront China in the vain hope that his attempt 
would succeed. Thus one can anticipate his repeated failures in 
the future. 
  Going against the trend, he is playing the international 
card 
everywhere he goes and is trying to pull together an 
anti-Chinese camp. He has failed in this attempt, however, as 
very few people are echoing his appeal. The Australian 
Government has simply ignored his call for support for his 
constitutional reform package, giving him a direct rebuff. That 
is why Chris Patten is now trying to explain away his vain 
attempt, saying that his current visit to Australia is not 
trying to seek support for his constitutional reform package but 
for the Sino-British Joint Declaration. He is just hoping to 
gloss over his awkward position. 
  Meanwhile, former Australian Prime Minister John Malcolm 
Fraser wrote to a newspaper to acutely expose Chris Patten's 
bluff and lie, pointing out that Patten knows little about Asia 
and Hong Kong and that his constitutional reform is mischief 
aimed at creating chaos in Hong Kong. Fraser refuted Chris 
Patten's absurd assurance that "even if the Australian 
Government supports the constitutional reform package, it will 
neither affect Australia's economic and trade relations with nor 
its investments in China." Fraser pointed out that, if 
Australia wants to strengthen its relations with Asian 
countries, it should strongly urge Chris Patten to withdraw his 
rash and mistaken policy. Prime Minister Keating declared long 
ago that he was not interested in the Patten package. During 
his meeting with Chris Patten yesterday, he absolutely refrained 
from touching on Chris Patten's constitutional reform package, 
nor did he express any intention of supporting it. Keating did 
not shake hands with Chris Patten before reporters, because 
shaking hands with him as the governor to a colony would not be 
in keeping with Australia's political goal of becoming a 
republic. The Australian mass media have played down Chris 
Patten's visit. Many local Chinese community leaders, as well 
as figures from the business circles, have expressed their 
views, noting that what Chris Patten has been doing in Hong Kong 
is unpopular with the Australian Chinese community. Chris Patten 
has found himself in a very isolated position, and his mission 
will prove fruitless. 
  Chris Patten opposes the Asian countries' policy that 
places political stability before economic development. His 
preaching has been refuted by Australian scholars. Before Chris 
Patten came to Hong Kong, the territory had properly handled the 
relationship between stability and prosperity as well as its 
relations with the Chinese mainland, thus maintaining sustained 
high economic growth. The Asian countries have established 
their unique political-economic model in light of the local 
historical and cultural realities and based on their own 
interpretation of human rights, which is different from that of 
the Western countries. As a result, they have created economic 
miracles and have emerged as a region which has enjoyed the most 
rapid economic growth in the world in recent years. In the 
meantime, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have 
mistakenly copied the western model. Being too anxious for 
quick success, they introduced drastic changes which have 
resulted in civil wars, economic decline, a worsening public 
security situation, and poverty and starvation among the people. 
As the Asian people uphold their Asian social development 
model, Chris Patten's fantasy of forcing Western value concepts 
into Asia is bound to arouse criticism from the Asian world. 
  While in Australia, Chris Patten has also talked glibly 
about 
the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The 
very soul of the Joint Declaration is China's resumption of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, on which date Britain 
will return Hong Kong to China, and then all Hong Kong affairs 
will become China's internal affairs, and China will apply the 
principle of one country, two systems to Hong Kong in accordance 
with the Basic Law. If Chris Patten thinks that his 
manipulation of Legco will enable him to push through his 
constitutional reform package and then have it extended beyond 
1997, then he is certainly making a terrible mistake. According 
to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, international law, and 
the Basic Law, no colonial government has the right to establish 
any organizations of political power on behalf of the Special 
Administrative Region government which is to rule the territory 
after 1997. Therefore, Chris Patten's constitutional reform 
will be short-lived, and the three-tier councils he is to 
establish will inevitably be dismissed on 1 July 1997.

<F P=106> [By Mary Binks, Political Editor] </F>
  [Text] Britain and China are to return to the negotiating 
table in a week to attempt to resolve differences on the 
sensitive question of military sites in Hong Kong after 1997 -- 
an impasse which has already spanned more than seven years. 
  While both sides have been close to an agreement for some 
months, the obstacle remains China's demand for a much bigger 
naval base for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) than the one 
being built on Stonecutters Island. 
  Joint Liaison Group (JLG) experts from the two sides will 
meet for three of the four days scheduled from 22 to 25 February 
in Hong Kong to resolve differences over the disposal of 
military sites -- an issue which China believes goes to the 
heart of its sovereignty. 
  The discussions will also involve military site inspections 
of as yet undisclosed locations. There are up to 30 military 
sites in Hong Kong. Alan Paul, who will be heading the British 
team, yesterday expressed optimism over the forthcoming 
discussions, saying China's agreement to three days of talks 
rather than the usual two days augured well for a satisfactory 
outcome. 
  The last bilateral meeting of defence experts, held from 21 
to 23 December, made only limited progress towards an agreement 
on details of future defence arrangements. China's insistence 
on a bigger naval base on Stonecutters Island is based on its 
argument that its size must be comparable with HMS Tamar on the 
Central waterfront. 
  But in the last round of talks the British side stood firm 
on 
demands for a bigger base. It is concerned that legislators 
will baulk at approving more funds to expand the site. Moving 
the naval facilities from Central has already cost more than 
$358 million. 
  JLG discussions will also focus on Britain's demand for a 
guarantee from China to return to the post-1997 Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) government any military sites unused 
by the PLA. Another area of contention is the Chinese side's 
desire to keep the married quarters currently used by British 
troops as quarters for PLA officers. 
  The prospect of next week's meeting has raised hopes that 
strained relations over the political row will not impede 
co-operation on other crucial handover issues. 
  Sources on both sides yesterday expressed the hope that the 
pace of work by the JLG might now pick up, averting the need by 
Britain to take unilateral action. However, concerns remain 
that talks on funding for Chek Lap Kok airport and Container 
Terminal No 9 have been hindered by the political reform row. 
  The Chinese side is expected next week to propose a meeting 
of the JLG's airport committee to discuss Britain's latest 
financing proposal.

  [Text] The Provisional Airport Authority has appointed 
Hank Townsend as its Chief Executive Officer for the next three 
years. But as Cliff Bale reports, the appointment is likely to 
be criticized by legislative councillors. 
  [Begin Bale recording] Dr. Townsend was appointed as Chief 
Executive Officer one year ago following the sudden departure of 
Richard Allen. He was seconded from the International Bechtel 
which is in charge of the project management of the airport core 
program. The Provisional Airport authority said in a statement 
that Dr Townsend would now sever his links with Bechtel and the 
Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod was quoted as welcoming 
the three-year appointment. He said he was sure Dr Townsend 
would provide the authority with the confidence and continuity 
needed to complete the airport to the maximum extent possible by 
mid-1997. However that is unlikely to calm the worries of 
legislative councillors over the appointment. The infrastruture 
spokesman for the United Democrats, Albert Chan, says that the 
move violates the authority's localization and open recruitment 
policy. He will discuss the issue with the Secretary for 
Economic Services, Gordon Siu, this afternoon [end recording].

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 15 (XINHUA) -- The Vietnamese 
boat people held protest demonstrations and hunger strikes here 
today in response to the repatriation proposals endorsed at a 
multi-national meeting being held in Geneva. 
  About 400 Vietnamese boat people staged a mass demonstration 
at Tai A Chau Detention Center against the new repatriation 
measures which order all the 52,000 Vietnamese asylum-seekers in 
camps of Asian countries to return to their homes by the end of 
next year. 
  Tension mounted in the detention camps Monday [14 February] 
when detainees awaited the outcome of the Geneva meeting which 
agreed to speed up the repatriation by returning all those who 
did not actively object to returning. 
  Camp protests swelled across the detention centers in Hong 
Kong. Some 90 people, including a few of pregnant women, staged 
a hunger strike at Kai Tak Transit Center Monday, shouting 
slogans in protest against the Hong Kong Government's screening 
policy to determine refugee status. 
  However, the overall atmosphere in the camps had become calm 
and peaceful although a number of peaceful demonstrations in 
various detention centers took place coinciding with the Geneva 
meeting, local acting secretary for security announced at a 
press conference held here today. 
  Of all the 52,000 Vietnamese asylum-seekers in Asian camps, 
about half, or 25,660 Vietnamese boat people, are staying in 
Hong Kong. The majority of them have been screened out and the 
rest are awaiting for screening, according to the latest 
government figures. 
  Hong Kong Acting Secretary for Security Ken Woodhouse said 
today that he welcomed the U.N. new decision on repatriation. 
  "While voluntary repatriation remains our preferred option 
for securing the return of the Vietnamese to Vietnam, there is a 
need to speed up the process of repatriation to meet the 
internationally agreed two-year timetable," he said at a press 
conference held here today. 
  The Vietnamese boat people have been a heavy burden for Hong 
Kong in the past 18 years and the recent decision will send a 
clear message to the camp population that their future lies in 
Vietnam not in camps in Hong Kong, he added. 
  It was reported Hong Kong may offer three options to 
detainees: the existing voluntary repatriation program, a forced 
repatriation program and the non-objectors program for those who 
do not volunteer to return. 
  "We will begin to work out the details for the non-objectors 
scheme with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees as 
soon as practicable," Woodhouse said.

  [Text] Macao, February 16 (XINHUA) -- Some 1,000 people 
from all walks of life attended here today a party sponsored by 
the XINHUA news agency Macao branch to celebrate the lunar new 
year of the dog. 
  Guo Dongpo, director of the branch who presided over the 
party, said that tasks concerning the transition in Macao are 
expected to be completed in 1994. He expressed the hope that 
the two governments of China and Portugal will continue to work 
for the strengthening of the friendly cooperation between the 
two countries to safeguard the social stability and economic 
development in Macao. 
  He also hoped that the Macao compatriots and people from all 
walks of life will learn more about the Basic Law of Macao 
Special Administrative Region, understand better the policy of 
"one country, two systems" and actively participate in handling 
the various matters in the transitional period so as to 
contribute more to the smooth transition in Macao. 
  Macao Governor General Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira said since 
the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and 
Portugal 15 years ago, the two countries have cooperated 
friendly on the basis of mutual trust. 
  "Our responsibility is to try our best to maintain forever 
this friendly cooperation and make Macao a symbol of this 
spirit," he added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Feb 15 (AFP)--Chinese authorities have 
given a written guarantee to the Macao Supreme Court that two 
suspects awaiting extradition from Macao will not be sentenced 
to death in China, a report said Tuesday. 
  The Lusa news agency, in a report monitored here, said the 
guarantee was contained in a letter sent to the court by Macao 
Xinhua Vice-Director Ke Xiaogang. 
  China has asked for the extradition of Bolivian passport 
holder Antonio Ti Luo, 45, who is wanted on charges involving a 
50 million dollar joint venture fraud, and Hong Kong British 
Passport holder Yeung Yuk-leung, who is wanted on murder 
charges, Lusa said. 
  The Supreme Court in the Portuguese enclave is due to rule 
on 
the request, although no date has yet been set. 
  Portugal abolished the death penalty in the last century and 
under its constitution extraditions cannot be carried out for 
crimes involving capital punishment. 
  The Macao lawyer of the two accused, Pedro Redinha, has 
questioned the guarantee, saying the Xinhua bureau is only a 
consular entity which would not have the power to commit state 
authorities to the pledge. 
  London-based Amnesty International has also taken an 
interest 
in the case of Antonio Ti Luo and called on Macao not to 
extradite him as Portugal has no extradition treaty with China 
and because of its constitution, the agency said.

<F P=106> [Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Hoping the </F>
`Tang-Chiao Talks' Will Be Fruitful"] 
  [Text] Brother: 
  This year's spring festival will arrive soon. On this 
traditional festival of the Chinese nation for reunion, Chiao 
Jen-ho, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] vice chairman 
and concurrently its secretary-general, and his entourage have 
arrived in Beijing; their arrival has added a propitious 
atmosphere for national reunion in the capital. 
  The current meeting is the first between high-ranking 
responsible persons of the nongovernment organizations 
separately authorized by Taiwan and the mainland since Chiao 
Jen-ho was transferred from being Taiwan "Mainland Affairs 
Council deputy director" to the office of SEF vice chairman and 
concurrently its secretary-general, and since the Wang-Koo talks 
held in Singapore in late April last year. Some ups and downs 
took place before the current meeting, which is finally to be 
held, which is most comforting. 
  According to the "Accord on Institutions of Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]-SEF Contacts and 
Talks" reached during the Wang-Koo talks, "the ARATS acting vice 
chairman and SEF deputy vice chairman, or the two organizations' 
secretaries-general will conduct talks on routine affairs every 
six months in principle, on each shore on a rotating basis, or 
in a negotiated third place." To implement this accord, the 
mainland has exerted unremitting efforts. With the reshuffling 
of SEF high-ranking personnel, ARATS acting vice chairman Tang 
Shubei and its secretary-general Zou Zhekai sent a 
congratulatory cable to Chiao Jen-ho, who had just taken up the 
office of SEF vice chairman and concurrently its 
secretary-general, and invited him to visit Beijing to negotiate 
routine affairs of the two organizations. 
  In early December last year, when Chiao Jen-ho first took 
office as SEF vice chairman and concurrently its 
secretary-general, he stated that "the tenure of 
secretary-general is three years, and I hope that some 
achievements will be scored." According to the spirit of the 
accord of the Wang-Koo talks on regular reciprocal visits 
between the two organizations, Chiao Jen-ho decided to set 
Taipei as the place for the third ARATS-SEF work negotiations; 
at the same time, he twice invited ARATS Acting Vice Chairman 
Tang Shubei to visit Taiwan. Although no accord was reached 
during the Taipei ARATS-SEF talks, results of a certain stage 
were scored, and laid a foundation for work negotiations from 
now on. Regrettably, a precondition of Chiao Jen-ho's 
invitation to Tang Shubei to visit Taiwan was that an accord 
should be reached in the Taipei talks; consequently, the purpose 
of the trip was not fulfilled. Even so, when Chiao Jen-ho 
expressed the hope that he would visit Beijing to meet ARATS 
Acting Vice Chairman Tang Shubei when the Taipei talks had just 
concluded, the mainland side expressed its consent, taking into 
consideration the overall situation of cross-strait relations. 
  Just when the ARATS and the SEF had officially settled that 
the "Tang-Chiao talks" were to be held in Beijing in late 
January, the Taiwan "Mainland Affairs Council" raised unexpected 
trouble, saying that the signing of a joint communique by China 
and France in which France pledged that it would no longer sell 
weapons to Taiwan, and China's restoring diplomatic relations 
with Lesotho were "various unfriendly actions" by the mainland 
toward Taiwan," and stated that it would "reassess" the 
"Tang-Chiao talks." For a while, there was an uproar in Taiwan 
public opinion. Under pressure from the people, the Taiwan 
"Mainland Affairs Council" made another decision to authorize 
Chiao Yen-ho to go to Beijing to talk with Tang Shubei, and thus 
the storm was pacified. 
  The ups and downs of the "Tang-Chiao talks" gave people much 
food for thought. To my mind, mutual trust is today still not 
on the horizon in cross-strait relations; and one of the 
important causes is that there have been insufficient ties 
between them, especially comparatively high-ranking exchanges. 
In the "Accord on Institutions for ARATS-SEF Contacts and 
Talks," meetings of ARATS and SEF responsible persons of various 
levels are stipulated. However, it is not very easy to implement 
the accord, which more often than not is subjected to 
interference from artificial factors. 
  At the press conference held at the conclusion of the third 
session of the first council of the association for cross-strait 
relations last 13 January, a reporter asked ARATS Chairman Wang 
Daohan what his deepest experience had been during his two years 
in office as ARATS chairman. He answered: Taiwan and the 
mainland should augment ties and exchanges; constant contacts 
and ties between high-ranking responsible persons would be 
helpful to removing misunderstanding while deepening 
understanding, expanding common understanding, and pushing 
forward the sound mutual development of cross-strait relations. 
Wang Daohan's experience reflected the universal aspirations of 
people on the two shores as well as his expectations on 
augmenting the contacts and ties between the ARATS and the SEF, 
these two authorized nongovernment organizations. 
  At present, the regular, institutionalized ARATS-SEF ties 
and 
contacts are just a beginning. A good beginning means something 
is half done. It is expected that during the new year, the 
cooperation between the ARATS and the SEF, these two authorized 
nongovernment organizations, will take on a new atmosphere, with 
still greater progress in the comprehensive implementation of 
the accord of the Wang-Koo talks, especially in augmenting 
cross-strait economic exchanges and economic and trade 
cooperation. We sincerely hope that the "Tang-Chiao talks," the 
first round of talks between responsible persons since the 
Wang-Koo talks, will score positive results. 
  Best regards, 
  [Signed] Bao Xin 
  [Dated] 25 January

Exploitation of Offshore Oil Resources"] 
  [Text] "The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should begin 
their economic cooperation in the area of offshore oil 
resources. They should choose the forms and areas of 
cooperation they agree on and start cooperation in various 
activities related to offshore oil resources as soon as 
possible." This was the strong wish expressed by the members of

during their mainland trip. The association's primary member is 
the Taiwan China Petroleum Company. 
  Chen Bingqian, vice president of the China National Offshore 
Oil Corporation, told the delegation that for many years the 
mainland has hoped that Taiwan's petroleum industry would 
participate in the mainland's offshore oil prospecting and 
exploitation activities. He also praised the delegation's trip 
as a good beginning for and a successful step toward cooperation 
in oil resources between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
  The delegation is visiting at the invitation of the China 
National Offshore Oil Corporation. It arrived in Beijing on 6 
January and will return to Taiwan on 5 February.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 15 (CNS)---Deputy Director of 
the Guangzhou Municipal Taiwan Affairs Office, Mr. He Jiaxin, 
speaking in an interview with this agency, said that Guangzhou 
Municipality would further enlarge its economic cooperation and 
exchanges with Taiwan. 
  According to Mr. He, Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong 
Province, now has 673 Taiwan-funded enterprises and 277 
enterprises invested in by people who have relatives in the 
island and of these enterprises, 10 each have investment of 
U.S.$10 million and 90 percent of these enterprises are earning 
profits. The newly-set-up enterprises of this kind have their 
businesses shifting away from simple shoe-making into light 
industry, chemical industry, electronics, textiles, machinery, 
real estate and domestic animal-breeding. 
  Mr. He said that the new tax system starting to be 
implemented this year would pose no bad influence to Taiwan 
businessmen's earnings in the city and the city's favorable 
policies set for them remained unchanged. Moreover, the city 
would continue to improve its services to them. 
  Mr. He held that though much effort was being made in the 
introduction of funds from Taiwan, the city was backward in this 
sector compared with the Yangtze River delta area. The city 
would, therefore, grasp the present opportunity, make every 
effort to improve the environment for investment and find new 
ways for making greater progress in the introduction of capital 
from the island. 
  Mr. He revealed that the city would engage in four main 
activities in this sector. First, it will convene a meeting on 
Taiwan-related economy and trade. Second, it will invite a 
batch of Taiwan compatriots to take part in the Litchi Festival 
to be held in the city. Third, it will send a delegation of 
entrepreneurs from the city to visit Taiwan and fourth, it will 
invite big financial groups, famous entrepreneurs and personnel 
from economic circles in the island to pay inspection visits to 
the city.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA) -- Taiwan will not be 
adversely affected by a collapse in trade talks between the 
United States and Japan, Economics Minister P.K. Chiang said 
Wednesday [16 February]. 
  As a matter of fact, Chiang said, Taiwan might end up 
benefiting from the appreciating Japanese yen and eventually 
increase its exports of semi-finished products and spare parts 
to Japan. 
  In the wake of collapsed trade talks with Japan, the Clinton 
administration is taking steps to impose trade sanctions against 
the Japanese. 
  Chiang said Japanese-made cellular phones could be the first 
victim in a string of US trade actions against Japan as the 
Clinton administration seeks ways to reduce a trade deficit with 
Japan that soared 20 percent last year to nearly US$60 billion. 
  As the yen soars, Chiang said, the Japanese manufacturers 
will be forced to increase imports of semi-finished products and 
parts to cut production costs. Such a move would bring more 
orders for Taiwan exporters, he added. 
  Chiang warned, however, that many Taiwan manufacturers will 
suffer from the yen's appreciation because of their heavy 
dependence on Japanese parts and components.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui's 
current trip to Southeast Asia has won recognition from the 
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). 
  Li, who started the unofficial visit on Feb. 9, is scheduled 
to return to Taipei late Wednesday. He has met with Philippine 
President Fidel Ramos, Indonesian President Suharto, and 
Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Likphai during the three-country 
tour. 
  H.I. Lu, chief of the DPP caucus at the Legislative Yuan, 
said Wednesday that the president's tour certainly has had a 
positive impact on both Taiwan's international relations and 
economic policy toward Southeast Asian nations. 
  The government has been promoting its "southern strategy" to 
encourage Taiwan manufacturers to increase investments in 
Vietnam and member countries of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations, which groups Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, 
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Brunei. 
  "The DPP is positive toward Li's efforts in strengthening 
Taiwan's external relations and in helping Taiwan investors find 
more investment channels," Lu noted. 
  The DPP lawmaker, however, pointed out that the president 
alone should not dominate Taiwan's foreign affairs. Foreign 
relations should be the common responsibility of both ruling and 
opposition parties, he said.

  [Text] In an attempt to further develop the cult of 
China's "chief architect of reform", Deng Xiaoping, a new film 
about the patriarch's later life is about to go into production. 
  The movie follows the publication of the third volume of Mr. 
Deng's collected works, the first volume of the biography 
written by his daughter, Deng Rong, and numerous semi-official 
books and magazine articles about his life and works. 
  Posters and badges featuring the face of the "chief 
architect" have also started to make their appearance in the 
shops, evoking memories of the personality cult which surrounded 
Chairman Mao Zedong towards the end of his life. 
  Analysts said the mass of publicity surrounding Mr. Deng was 
designed to establish a definitive place for the patriarch in 
the annals of Communist Party history before he finally dies. A 
Western diplomat said: "Deng is obviously in a very poor state 
of health and I get the feeling there is an increased sense of 
urgency about getting the Deng cult in place before he goes to 
meet Marx." 
  The new film is to be directed by Ding Yinnan, who has 
previously made feature films about the lives of the founder of 
the Chinese Republic, Sun Yat-sen and the late premier of the 
People's Republic, Zhou Enlai. 
  Film industry sources say that Ding was chosen largely 
because of his sycophantic and sanitised depiction of Zhou in 
the 1991 movie. Although the director and the screenplay have 
been finalised, the film studio has still not found an actor for 
the lead role. Such roles have traditionally gone to actors a 
close resemblance to the lead character. 
  "I heard the main problem was finding someone the same 
height," a Beijing based film producer said Mr. Deng is just 
over 1.5 metres tall.

Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 
1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Feb (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng chaired 
the fifth (enlarged) plenary session of the State Council this 
afternoon to discuss the government work report (draft for 
soliciting comments) to be submitted to the second session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] for deliberation. 
  Li Peng said at the meeting that 1993 was a year in which 
the 
nation fully implemented the guidelines laid down by the 14th 
national party congress and proceeded victoriously along the 
course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; major 
successes were achieved in reform, opening up, and 
modernization; new situations appeared in work in all fields; 
and the tasks which the first session of the Eighth NPC set for 
the year were basically accomplished. 
  He said: The year 1994 is important for the national economy 
to maintain its good developmental momentum and a year crucial 
for expediting reform. On the basis of fully analyzing the 
situations at home and abroad, the CPC Central Committee has 
clearly defined the basic principle governing the work of the 
whole party and the whole country. This principle is: Under 
the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidance of the 
party's basic line, we should fully implement the guidelines 
laid down by the 14th national party congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; accelerate 
the process of building a socialist market economic system; 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic 
development; maintain political stability; and expedite social 
progress in all fields. The CPC Central Committee stressed that 
seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to 
the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability are requirements of overall importance for the whole 
party and the whole country. The State Council and governments 
at all levels must clearly understand these requirements while 
doing their work in all fields and must earnestly and properly 
handle the relationship among reform, development, and 
stability. We must continue to be firm in handling things in 
two areas at the same time, namely: While concentrating our 
efforts on promoting economic development and reform, we must 
make positive efforts to develop science and technology 
education and cultural services, intensify construction of 
socialist spiritual civilization, and intensify construction of 
a socialist democracy and legal system. This is also the basic 
principle we followed while drafting the government work report. 
  Li Peng said: The government work report has been printed 
and distributed to all departments, all relevant units, and all 
provinces, municipalities, and regions to solicit their 
comments. The purpose of doing so is to pool the ideas of all 
quarters so that the government work report can embody the views 
and wishes of all social circles, and so that the government 
will be able to do its work more effectively. 
  During the meeting today, Wang Mengkui, deputy director of 
the State Council Research Office and person in charge of the 
government work report drafting panel, reported on the drafting 
of the report. 
  Taking the floor one after another, Zhu Kaixuan, minister in 
charge of the State Education Commission; Cao Qingze, minister 
of supervision; Li Boyong, minister of labor; Wu Jiquan, 
minister of posts and telecommunications; Liu Jiang, minister of 
agriculture; Xu Youfang, minister of forestry; Chen Minzhang, 
minister of public health; Lu Peijian, auditor general; Zhu Xun, 
minister of geology and mineral resources; Hou Jie, minister of 
construction; Shi Dazhen, minister of power industry; Gu 
Xiulian, minister of chemical industry; and Wu Yi, minister of 
foreign trade and economic cooperation, discussed the government 
work report (draft for soliciting comments) and expressed their 
views on places that need to be amended. 
  Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, Chi 
Haotian, 
Li Guixian, Chen Junsheng, Peng Peiyun, Luo Gan, and other State 
Council members attended the meeting. 
  Responsible persons of relevant departments under the CPC 
Central Committee, the State Council, the NPC, the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, the Central Military Commission, the Supreme 
People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate attended 
the meeting as observers. Responsible persons of various 
democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and 
Commerce, and mass organizations, as well as personnel without 
party affiliations also attended the meeting as observers.

  [Text] Beijing, February 15 (XINHUA) -- The State Council, 
or Chinese cabinet, this afternoon held its fifth plenary 
meeting. 
  It discussed the draft of its report on government work 
which 
will be submitted to the forthcoming second session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) for deliberation. 
  Premier Li Peng presided over today's enlarged plenary 
meeting. 
  He told the council that 1993 was the year when China 
carried 
out the spirit of the 14th national congress of the Communist 
Party of China (CPC) in an all-round way, and marched 
victoriously forward along the road of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  Great achievements were made during the year in the reform, 
opening up and socialist modernization drive and all other 
aspects of work. The annual tasks set for the year by the first 
NPC session were basically accomplished, he said. 
  Premier Li said 1994 is an important year for China to 
maintain a sustained and healthy development of the national 
economy and a critical year for the country to make further 
reforms. 
  On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the current 
domestic and international situation, he said, the CPC Central 
Committee had put forth a basic principle for the work of the 
whole party and the whole nation this year. 
  The principle is to be under the guidance of comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, carry out in an 
all-round way the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
speed up the pace of building a socialist market economic 
system, ensure a sustained, quick and healthy development of the 
national economy, maintain political stability, and promote 
social progress in an all-round way. 
  Premier Li said that the CPC Central Committee had 
emphasized 
that to seize the current opportunity to deepen the reform, open 
wider to the outside world, promote development and maintain 
stability are the major tasks of the whole party and the whole 
nation. 
  The State Council and governments at other levels should 
keep 
this in mind in every aspect of their work and seriously handle 
the relations between reform, development and stability. 
  While concentrating efforts on promotion of economic 
development and reform, it is also necessary to actively develop 
the causes of science, technology, education and culture, 
greatly promote cultural and ideological progress of the 
socialist society, raise the level of socialist democracy, and 
improve the socialist legal system. 
  The draft of the government work report has been printed and 
distributed to all the departments, provinces, municipalities, 
autonomous regions and other units involved to solicit 
suggestions so as to draw on collective wisdom and absorb all 
useful ideas. 
  Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the Research Office of the 
State Council and head of the group in charge of drafting the 
government work report, gave today's meeting an introduction to 
the process of drafting the report. Many ministers of the State 
Council voiced their opinions on revisions of the draft. 
  Among those at today's meeting were Vice-Premiers Zhu 
Rongji, 
Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen and Li Lanqing, as well State 
Councillors Chi Haotian, Li Guixian, Chen Junsheng, Peng Peiyun 
and Luo Gan. 
  Some other leaders of the CPC Central Committee, State 
Council, NPC, National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, Central Military Commission, 
Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, 
non-communist parties, and mass organizations also attended the 
meeting as observers.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] A ferocious debate has started over the final draft 
of Prime Minister Li Peng's Government Work Report to the 
National People's Congress (NPC) which will lay down the 
directions of economic development for 1994. However, in the 
interest of preserving the facade of unity, the senior 
leadership has asked officials, academics and the media to stop 
open debates about controversial issues including the national 
growth rate. 
  In a rare move, Mr. Li yesterday invited regional cadres, 
experts and noncommunist politicians to air their views on the 
report, which will be presented to the NPC when it opens on 
March 10. 
  The principles underlying the report were disclosed by the 
premier at an enlarged meeting of the State Council yesterday. 
"We must seriously handle well the relationship between reform, 
development and stability," XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) 
last night quoted Mr. Li as saying. 
  The premier repeated the development strategy adopted by the 
Politburo last month: "Seize the opportunity; deepen reform; 
expand the open door; promote development; maintain stability." 
He added the report would be guided by patriarch Deng 
Xiaoping's theory for building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  The drafting team of the report is headed by the Deputy 
Director of the State Council Research Office, Wang Mengkui, 
regarded as a cautious technocrat. 
  Sources said the report would give pride of place to 
stability, and that in spite of the reference to Mr. Deng's 
edicts, his ideal about "fastpaced reform and growth" had been 
dropped. For example, the Politburo has decided that, to curb 
hyperinflation and fixed-assets investment, the growth rate must 
be scaled down from 13 per cent last year to nine per cent. 
  The sources said, however, that the leadership was thrown 
off 
balance by statements made by Mr. Deng in Shanghai last week. 
Following his practice for the past three years, Mr. Deng 
exhorted the Shanghai leadership to "go faster" in economic 
development. 
  While the patriarch had made no direct reference to other 
provinces and open cities, his words of encouragement to 
Shanghai were seen by regional cadres as support for their 
high-growth strategies. 
  Chinese economists said the nine per cent growth rate, which 
would be written into the report, would encounter opposition. 
They said if Beijing failed to restore financial discipline, a 
new austerity programme similar to the one launched in June, 
could not be ruled out for the second half of this year. 
  Beijing, however, was anxious to keep the debates about the 
growth rate under wraps . 
  While Mr. Li was preparing the final drafts of his 
Government 
Work Report, the Politburo and Cabinet were mapping out ways to 
ensure that local administrations and enterprises did not embark 
on another wave of excessive investments.

  [Text] Beijing, 6 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Tibetan Year of the 
Dog starts on 11 February. Hu Jintao, member of the Standing 
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee 
and member of the Secretariat, celebrated this traditional 
Tibetan festival with 300 Tibetan compatriots in Beijing today. 
  Nima Ciren [1441 3854 2945 0088], director of the Office of 
the Tibet Autonomous Region in Beijing, spoke at today's tea 
party marking the Tibetan Year of the Dog. He said: Under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and thanks to the generous support 
of people across the nation, Tibet made heartening progress in 
socialist construction in the past year. The region crossed a 
new threshold in its economic development, and achieved major 
progress in all sectors including education, science and

<F P=106> [By special reporter Ching Chi (5427 2765): "Four Major </F>
Problems in China's Society Connected With the Serious Situation 
of Abusing Power for Private Gain and Corruption"] 
  [Text] As China's restructuring and economic construction 
has entered a critical period, the development of the social 
situation is becoming more and more important. A few days ago, 
a number of experts spoke on four major existing problems when 
analyzing and forecasting the social situation in China. 
  1. Severe conflicts and problems have arisen in some 
important social and economic fields. Consequently, social 
lives are being markedly affected, and there are more unstable 
factors appearing in the social order. 
  It has been learned that, from January to September 1993, 
the 
cost of living in large and medium cities in China reached the 
highest growth rate compared with the same periods over the past 
several years. At the same time, the unemployment rate has been 
increasing, and the number of all sorts of cases handled by the 
public security organs has also increased slightly compared with 
that of the same period of last year. In addition, the blind 
establishment of development zones became a very severe 
phenomenon. This kind of chaotic economic life affects the 
overall mentality of society and has an adverse effect on the 
country's political, economic, and social life. 
  2. Corrupt practices committed by a handful of officials 
have been quite severe. They have abused power for private gain 
and have squandered and embezzled state property, which does 
great damage to the image of the party and the state and 
corrupts social values. According to the statistics, from 
January to September 1993, over 5,000 party and state 
functionaries were involved in cases cracked by procuratorial 
organs throughout the country, including 20 cadres at the 
department and bureau levels, one cadre at the vice-minister 
level, and more than 1,100 judicial personnel who were 
prosecuted for committing crimes. During this period, over 
40,000 economic cases of corruption, bribery, and embezzlement 
of public funds were placed on file for investigation, including 
nearly 24,000 large cases, each involving over 10,000 yuan, and 
a total of 504 officials at and above the county and department 
levels. 
  3. Not much progress is being made in readjusting various 
social relations. Those which are most important are: The 
relations between the central and local authorities are being 
affected by some negative factors, and the gap between the 
coastal developed areas and other localities is widening. The 
growth of investment along the coastal areas in eastern China is 
obviously higher than that of the areas in central and western 
China. As far as the investment made by state-owned units in 
October 1993 was concerned, investment made by 12 coastal areas 
in East China exceeded 43 billion yuan, registering an increase 
of nearly 76 percent over that of the same period last year. 
Investment made by eight areas in central China exceeded 16 
billion yuan, an increase of 40 percent, and investment made by 
nine areas in West China reached 8.6 billion yuan, which merely 
increased 20 percent. Moreover, it is still very obvious that 
the gap between urban and rural income is putting more and more 
peasants in a psychologically unbalanced state . 
  4. The extent of conformity in terms of social ethics and 
value concepts is lower; money worship has become a prevailing 
trend; the "blank spots" of social norms have not been filled 
promptly; all kinds of immoral behavior still exist even though 
efforts are repeatedly made to check it; and the phenomenon of 
lacking ethical progress is worsening. 
  The experts have advised that real progress in the 
anticorruption struggle should be made this year, and a critical 
step should be taken to establish sound laws and systems 
accordingly. 
  They maintained that the central government's authority 
should be strengthened to straighten out the relations between 
the central and local authorities and that the promotion of the 
divisional taxation system should be used as opportunity to 
establish new relations between the two. 
  In addition, they also suggested that the media should be 
used to give wide publicity to the central government's policies 
and that it is necessary to let the people air their opinions 
more frequently, to communicate with them, to monitor changes in 
public opinion, and to promptly redress the grievances of the 
masses. Meanwhile, it is also necessary to strengthen the 
supervisory and communication functions of the media so as to 
purify the general mood of society and to enhance social 
cohesion.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on crime, investigations, trials, sentencings, and other 
judicial- related activities in the PRC during the period 15-31 
January. The source and mode of processing are given in 
parentheses at the end of each entry. 
  As evidenced by the stories listed below, during the month 
PRC crime reportage focused on robbery, economic crime, and 
corruption. 
<H6>  CENTRAL </H6>
  In accordance with the Public Security Ministry's 
instruction 
to "do a good job in security work during the New Year and 
Spring Festival season and to ensure that the broad masses can 
spend an untroubled and harmonious holiday" in light of their 
respective local situations, the public security authorities in 
various localities have embarked on a "winter offensive" against 
crime with the theme of "cracking major cases and seizing 
escaped criminals." 
  Since the offensive began, Beijing Municipality, Shanghai 
Municipality, and Hubei Province alone have cracked 7,638 
various security and criminal cases, have arrested 6,472 
criminal offenders of all kinds, have smashed 781 criminal 
syndicates, and have seized illegally obtained money and goods 
worth more than 1.6 million yuan. 
  Beginning on 12 November last year, the public security 
bureau of Xian City, Shaanxi Province, carried out consecutive 
operations for over 10 days in a row and smashed a syndicate of 
14 criminals, headed by Liu Qiang and Liu Dongwei, who had been 
robbing taxi drivers at knifepoint. The public security bureau 
of Anshan City, Liaoning Province, solved an extremely large 
case of stolen gold and prevented state losses of nearly 200,000 
yuan. The Shanghai Municipal public security bureau solved a 
heinous case of robbery and homicide which had remained unsolved 
for three years by catching the arch-criminals Wang Xiaolong and 
Zhao Guofa. (Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 8 Jan 94 p 1) 
  Four members of a gang of masked burglars armed with knives, 
all unemployed young men from Zhejiang Province, were seized in 
Beijing while committing a robbery on 15 January. They are 
believed to be responsible for three other cases of burglary 
which occurred during the 11-14 January period, involving a 
total value of more than 100,000 yuan. The police are rounding 
up other members of the gang who are still at large. (Beijing 
ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in Chinese 0954 GMT 17 Jan 94) 
  A few days ago, the Shenzhen public security authorities 
smashed a gang that had been robbing Hong Kong container trucks. 
Three individuals were arrested during the operation. While 
waiting for customs clearance, many Hong Kong truck drivers pull 
up alongside roads near check points and sleep overnight in 
their cabs, where they are easy prey for the gang because the 
appropriate security measures have not been taken. 
  The Guangzhou Rail Transport Intermediate People's Court 
held 
rallies in Guangzhou, Changsha, Huaihua, and Hengyang to 
pronounce sentences on a group of individuals convicted of 
crimes committed on trains. Eighteen received death sentences, 
while the remaining 28 received death sentences with reprieve, 
life imprisonment, or jail terms of various lengths. The 
individuals were all convicted of robbing train passengers, some 
of hassling trains along certain railways, some of stealing 
passengers' property or train cargo, and some of murdering 
station guards. Between 1989 and 1992, Sun Changshan and 10 
others on 42 occasions stole train passengers' property, worth a 
total of 730,000 yuan, on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, 
Beijing-Guangdong, Hunan-Guizhou, and Beijing-Shanghai railways. 
All 11 were sentenced to death. (Hong Kong HSIN WAN PAO in 
Chinese 24 Jan 94) 
  On 24 January, the PEOPLE'S COURT NEWS reported that the PRC 
authorities have executed eight people in Guizhou and Sichuan 
Provinces for drug smuggling and train robbery. Yang Cangrong 
and Zhou Yu, both from Guizhou, were arrested in the southern 
city of Guangzhou while trying to sell 757 grams of heroin which 
they had purchased in Vietnam. Qin Changgui and Yang Lin, also 
from Guizhou, were arrested for the possession of 3.9 kg and 3.4 
kg of opium respectively, which they had purchased in Yunnan 
Province. All four were executed in Guizhou earlier this month. 
Four members of a gang implicated in 16 train robberies were 
executed in Sichuan. (Hong Kong AFP in English 1029 GMT 24 Jan 
94) 
  On 24 January, the Yunnan Frontier Defense Forces of the 
Armed police held a commendation meeting on the struggle against 
the smuggling of guns and drugs in Kunming. At the meeting, it 
was announced that the Yunnan and Guangxi Frontier Defense 
Forces had received a Collective Award of Merit for their 
"remarkable results" in the struggle against gun and drug 
smuggling. Since the campaign against gun and drug smuggling 
began in June 1993, the Yunnan Frontier Defense Headquarters has 
cracked a total of 218 gun-smuggling cases, seizing 119 military 
guns, 3,582 grenades, and 4,605 rounds of ammunition, and has 
solved 596 drug-trafficking cases, seizing 427.477 kg of heroin 
and 283.77 kg of opium. The Guangxi Frontier Defense 
Headquarters has solved a total of 100 gun- smuggling cases, 
capturing 208 military guns, 148 grenades, and 5,722 rounds of 
ammunition, and has cracked 39 drug-trafficking cases, seizing 
4.849 kg of heroin and 64.537 kg of opium. (Beijing GUANGMING 
RIBAO in Chinese 25 Jan 94) 
  The customs authorities in five coastal provinces, 
Guangdong, 
Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Hainan achieved marked results in 
their antismuggling activity last year, completely cracking 210 
maritime smuggling cases and seizing goods worth 493.86 million 
yuan, an increase of 40.6 percent over the previous year. The 
smuggled goods included cars, cigarettes, color television sets, 
and air conditioners. Car smuggling was prevalent on the seas 
of western Guangdong and Guangxi last year, while cigarettes 
were the main smuggled goods along the coastline of Fujian and 
Zhejiang. Some mainland ships were involved in smuggling under 
the guise of normal freight transportation activity. (Beijing

<H5>  Beijing </H5>
  The ninth plenary meeting of the capital's Committee for the 
Comprehensive Control of Public Order and Security has announced 
that the capital city has made major breakthroughs in three 
aspects of the "severe crackdown" against crime in 1993. 
  --A seven-member armed murderer gang was seized in the 
investigation of the taxi driver murder case on 31 January, and 
10 major and serious cases were cracked at the same time. Two 
Wuyi pistols and more than 100 bullets were seized. As a 
result, all the cases of armed crime that had occurred in 
Beijing in recent years were completely solved. Under the 
unified command of the Ministry of Public Security, the 
Municipal Public Security Bureau and the other departments 
concerned joined hands in solving serious robberies on 
international trains and arrested all the criminals in one move, 
restoring order on international trains. 
  --A number of major cases of economic fraud were solved, 
recovering property and cash worth 500 million yuan. In 
cooperation with Hebei Province, a case in which a criminal had 
been using the bank's reserve letter of credit to embezzle $10 
billion was cracked. Other major cases that were solved include 
the fraud case in which Zhang Xiangyu and other people illegally 
speculated in foreign exchange valued at 750 million yuan by 
falsely introducing "foreign investors," the fraud case in which 
Shang Yubin and other people obtained several hundred million 
yuan and $100 million of foreign currency through deceit and 
trickery, and the case in which Deng Fusen and other individuals 
gained 87,280 yuan by signing false steel sale contracts. 
(Beijing FAZHI RIBAO in Chinese 7 Jan 94 p 2) 
  The BEIJING EVENING NEWS on 25 January reported that six 
criminals found guilty of crimes ranging from rape to murder 
were executed in Beijing on 25 January. Another 12 individuals 
were sentenced to death for murder, armed robbery, and fraud, 
but the paper did not report when the sentences would be carried 
out. (Hong Kong AFP in English 1043 GMT 25 Jan 94) 
<H5>  Fujian </H5>
  Since last year, the Fujian Armed Police Headquarters has 
been cracking down on criminals who impersonate armed police 
officers in order to extort money from shops, restaurants, and 
bars and detain people under the pretense of checking identity 
cards or who use fake armed police driving licenses to carry out 
criminal activities. The authorities have discovered over 20 
"bogus armed policemen" and four bogus armed police driving 
licenses. (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in Chinese 0752 12 Jan 
94) 
  Today, the Higher People's Court of Fujian Province 
announced 
final sentences and second-trial sentences for 12 serious 
criminals accused of corruption and taking bribes. Six of them 
were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, and two were 
sentenced to life imprisonment. The 12 criminals were 
separately involved in seven major corruption cases and one 
bribe-taking case in eight prefectures and cities. A former 
section chief of the Fujian Foreign Trade Center was sentenced 
to death for embezzling $2.74 million and 640,000 yuan of public 
money. According to the president of the Provincial Higher 
People's Court, between August and December last year, his court 
handled and concluded 568 economic criminal cases and tried 888 
accused people. (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in Chinese 1000 
GMT 15 Jan 94) 
  The FUJIAN LEGAL NEWS, in its issue received in Hong Kong on 
24 January, reported that six managers and employees of state 
enterprises in southeastern Fujian Province have been condemned 
to death for accepting bribes totalling millions of dollars. A 
Fujian high court also condemned six others accused of 
corruption to jail terms, in two cases to life in prison. (Hong 
Kong AFP in English 0956 GMT 24 Jan 94) 
  Last year the frontier departments in Fujian's coastal areas 
cracked 86 cases of smuggling human cargo involving a total of 
1,408 people, arrested 294 organizers and transporters, and 
received, examined, and handled 3,325 repatriated illegal 
immigrants. In the meantime, they also seized 47 cases of 
smuggling goods involving a total of 197 people and smuggled 
goods worth more than 30 million yuan. They cracked six cases

  The authorities have been cracking down on robberies along 
the Guangzhou-Shantou highway. The economic development of 
recent years has meant that highway transportation has become 
busier and highway robberies have become more prevalent. In 
Yangxi County last year, 44 highway robbers were arrested -- 
four of whom were executed -- and 99 highway robbery cases were 
solved, of which 89 could be considered major. Most highway 
robbers are young people approximately 20 years old. (Guangzhou

  A number of offenders who had committed serious crimes were 
severely punished today. This represents the city courts' first 
large-scale crackdown this year. 
  This morning, mass rallies to pronounce judgments on 
criminals involved in serious cases were held simultaneously in 
Guangzhou's eight districts -- Liwan, Haizhu, Fangchun, Yuexiu, 
Dongshan, Baiyun, Tianhe, and Huangpu -- as well as in the 
cities of Huadu and Fanyu, at which 30 criminals involved in 19 
major cases of robbery, murder, theft, and illegal trading of 
guns and munitions were sentenced to death with the approval of 
the upper-level courts. They were escorted to the execution 
grounds immediately after the rallies to be shot. 
  Among the convicts sentenced to death was Lu Guiqiang, who, 
in collaboration with other people, on two occasions illegally 
purchased 10 Soviet-made model 54 military hand guns, 138 rounds 
of ammunition, and two pineapple-type hand grenades from Guangxi 
and other places during January and December 1991 and sold eight 
hand guns and 116 rounds of bullets to people in Guangzhou. In 
addition, Lu also collaborated with others to falsify two forged 
"deposit receipts for the options of savings and fixed 
accounts," purportedly issued by the Industrial and Commercial 
Bank of China Guangzhou Branch. He hurried to savings offices 
in Beijing Lu and other streets to cash 414,000 yuan and divided 
the illicit money with his accomplices. Lu's actions constitute 
the crimes of illegal gun and munitions trading and of 
swindling, so he was sentenced to death and was deprived of his 
political rights for life.

  Shenzhen's Wenjindu Customs cracked a drug-trafficking case 
on 11 January, the first of its kind in 1995. When conducting a 
routine border check on a Hong Kong truck bearing the name of a 
Shenzhen transportation company, customs investigators found 
that the cargo area of the truck was empty, with the exception 
of a travelling bag behind the driver's seat. When the 
officials started to examine the bag, the driver jumped out of 
the truck in an unsuccessful attempt to escape. When the bag 
was opened, 40 bricks of heroin were found inside, weighing 
approximately 14 kg. The case is still under investigation.

  Police in Yunnan Province smashed 4,174 cases of drug 
trafficking last year, with 6,191 criminals of Chinese or 
foreign nationality arrested. The official in charge of the 
provincial anti-narcotics office said that the police had seized 
3,546 kg of refined drugs, including heroin, a rise of 11 
percent, and 1,062 kg of opium, an increase of 57 percent over 
the previous year, while the number of cases solved last year 
was 14 percent up over 1992, with the number of suspects 
arrested rising by ten percent. The provincial authorities 
helped some 20,000 drug addicts get rid of their drug addiction. 
Yunnan was also involved in international cooperation against 
drug trafficking, including one supported by the United Nations 
which achieved a measure of success. The official added that the 
area under cultivation of opium poppy in the so-called Golden 
Triangle had increased in size in recent years. Drug trafficking 
from beyond the borders of Yunnan has imposed a direct and 
serious threat to the province because the infiltration of drugs 
into the province has become a serious problem. Yunnan will go 
further in strengthening its work in fighting drugs and will try 
its best to stop narcotics from flowing into the province.

  On 19 August 1993, three foreigners holding Maldivian and 
Costa Rican passports cashed more than 600 Westpac Banking 
Corporation traveler's checks, worth a total of some 270,000 
yuan, with various Bank of China money changers in Kunming. The 
numbers of the traveler's checks were found to form a sequence, 
which raised suspicion. When one of the swindlers went back to 
a money changer, he was detained for interrogation, and 
confessed to the police. This syndicate was composed of eight 
Pakistani nationals, five of whom were operating in Kunming at 
the time. 
  After they were arrested, two others flew in from Bangkok 
the 
next day, only to find themselves in a police car upon arrival. 
On 18 September, the boss of the syndicate, Aslam, arrived in 
Shantou, Guangdong Province. On 6 October, he was taken to 
Kunming by the police. Police findings indicate that all the 
traveler's checks held by this syndicate had been stolen in 
Bangkok. They cashed 1,075 of them in Kunming alone, worth 
100,750 Australian dollars. They also were found to be carrying 
British sterling and U.S. dollar traveler's checks, plus eight 
forged passports. On approval of the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, four members of the gang, including Aslam, were 
officially arrested. The other members were deported and 
refused re-entry for five years. (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on crime, investigations, trials, sentencings, and other 
judicial-related activities in the PRC monitored during the 
period 1-14 February 1994. The source and mode of processing 
are given in parentheses at the end of each entry. 
  As evidenced by the stories listed below, during the month 
PRC crime reportage focused on corruption, economic crimes, and 
the annual round of executions taking place around Spring 
Festival.

  Twenty-two Chinese have been executed in the past few days 
in 
what has become a traditional clampdown ahead of the Lunar New 
Year. A total of 13 people were executed in Shanghai on 1 
February, all charged with murder and theft. Several more were 
condemned to death or prison terms. 
  Nine criminals were executed on 29 January in Jinan, and two 
bank employees were sentenced to death for corruption in Inner 
Mongolia recently. (Hong Kong AFP in English 1028 GMT 2 Feb 94) 
  More than 200 Chinese have been executed since 1 January, 
condemned for such crimes as murder, rape, drug trafficking, and 
financial crimes. 
  The run-up to the Lunar New Year is traditionally used by 
the 
government to press the Chinese regional authorities to sentence 
common-law criminals in order to avoid unrest during the festive 
season. Amnesty International says it recorded 1,890 death 
sentences and 1,079 executions in 1992, but believes these 
numbers to be conservative. (Hong Kong AFP in English 0911 GMT 
8 Feb 94) 
  In 1993 public security forces and border guards in Yunnan 
and Guangxi took effective actions to crack down on firearms and 
drug trafficking and smuggling. In the whole year, the public 
security organs and border guards in these two provinces cracked 
324 firearms trafficking cases, seizing 374 pieces of military 
firearms. They also cracked 961 drug trafficking cases, seizing 
812.3 kg of opium and 762.5 kg of heroin. The actions totally 
destroyed 136 criminal gangs. 
  The public security organs and border guard units in these 
two provinces transferred some 500 people from commanding organs 
to replenish the troops on active duty. The border inspection 
stations were on duty 24 hours a day, and strictly examined the 
vehicles and personnel moving to the interior mainland. 
  On the afternoon of 22 December 1993, the border security 
checkpoint in Mukang of Dehong Autonomous Prefecture discovered 
46.5 kg of heroin divided among three vehicles moving through 
the border to the interior area. 
  In order to mobilize the masses, the public security and 
border guard forces in Yunnan and Guangxi also dispatched a 
large number of police officers to border villages to publicize 
the government's policy on capturing smuggled drugs and firearms 
and to build up the police-civilian security network. According 
to Yunnan's incomplete statistics, in 1993 the masses provided 
148 pieces of information for the public security organs and 
assisted the police force in 193 actions. (Beijing RENMIN RIBAO

  According to data provided by procuratorial organs in 
Beijing 
Municipality, in 1993 the municipal procuratorial organs handled 
1,466 corruption and other economic criminal cases, and placed 
844 cases on file for investigation and prosecution, including 
618 corruption and bribe-taking cases, which accounted for 73.2 
percent of the economic criminal cases. One ministerial-level, 
10 bureau-level, and 48 section-level corrupt officials were 
investigated and prosecuted. 
  Last August, procuratorial cadres in Beijing launched an 
unprecedented anticorruption campaign and they cracked a large 
number of major corruption and bribe-taking cases in party and 
government institutions, law enforcement institutions, banking 
institutions, and economic management institutions. Fourteen 
major corruption and bribery cases involving an amount of over 1 
million yuan were placed on file for investigation and 
prosecution, 38 corruption cases arising in law enforcement and 
judicial organs were handled, 128 criminal cases involved 
officials in various party and government institutions, and 37 
criminal cases involved personnel of banking institutions. 
  The procuratorial organs achieved such marked results 
because 
the chief procurators at all levels personally organized and 
directed the handling of all major and serious cases. The 
leaders of the municipal procuratorate personally took charge of 
the investigation and prosecution of 22 major cases involving 
over 1 million yuan of ill-gotten money or involving cadres at 
and above the bureau level. (Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 1 
Feb 94 p 3) 
  Public security organs in Beijing Municipality achieved 
remarkable results in using the news media to issue "wanted" 
circulars for criminals at large. In 1993 a total of 428 
criminals were arrested through such means, which helped crack 
520 major criminal cases. (Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in 
Chinese 0600 GMT 14 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Fujian </H5>
  In 1993, Fujian's public security organs cracked a total 62 
drug- related cases, captured over 220 drug traffickers, and 
seized 57.2 kg of drugs, as well as over 1.5 million yuan in 
profits from drug deals. 
  Over recent years, drug-trafficking rings and lawbreakers 
outside China have opened secret sea smuggling routes into 
Fujian. Driven by high profits, some wrongdoers inside China 
are willing to risk their lives and engage in drug trafficking. 
Since the beginning of this year public security organs of all 
prefectures, cities, and major counties have stepped up efforts 
in deploying antidrug police forces and setting up special 
investigation organs for cracking drug-related cases, while 
leaders of public security organs at all levels have attached 
great importance to such investigations. 
  From May to June 1993, public security organs across the 
province carried out a joint operation and cracked six 
"ice"-manufacturing dens set up by Taiwan drug dealers in 
Fuzhou, Putian, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou. On 8 May, the Quanzhou 
public security organs cracked a drug-trafficking ring involving 
drug dealers and lawbreakers from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the 
mainland, and seized 36 kg of drugs and heroin. Meanwhile, 
public security organs in all localities have made great efforts 
to trace drug sources of drug addicts, and successfully smashed 
a number of secret dens which "used drug trafficking to finance 
drug taking." (Fuzhou FUJIAN RIBAO in Chinese 23 Jan 94 p 7) 
  At a 15 January news briefing, He Xiaofang, vice president 
of 
the Fujian Provincial People's Court, announced eight cases of 
serious economic crime out of which 12 people were been 
sentenced to death, death with reprieve, life imprisonment, and 
fixed terms of imprisonment. 
  The criminals sentenced to death included: The former first

  Eighteen criminals in Changle and Pingtan Counties involved 
in the smuggling of people have been sentenced to one to five 
years of imprisonment. The 18 criminals were all "snakeheads." 
  This move is aimed at curbing the activities of illegal 
emigration from the province and is the biggest campaign for 
this purpose since the beginning of 1994. Officials have 
revealed that the province will continue its severe crackdown on 
these criminal activities. (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in

  Cao Zidong, deputy director of the Public Security 
Department 
of Guangdong Province, said on 1 February 1994 that the public 
security organs last year arrested over 110,000 criminal 
offenders of all types, an increase of more than 30 percent over 
the previous year. He also said they cracked over 80,000 
criminal cases, including more than 40,000 major cases. 
  Cao Zidong said: Since late December the public security 
organs have arrested over 2,000 train and bus robbers, and have 
also arrested more than 18,000 criminals. In this period, 
railway and highway robbery cases decreased sharply, and 
criminal cases of other types also decreased to a certain 
degree. (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in Chinese 1248 GMT 1 Feb

sentences of five years, or even more, including life-in-prison 
and death sentences, according to Xu Liang, Guangdong Provincial 
Higher People's Court vice president. 
  Through hearing the aforesaid cases, the court believed that 
car and train robbery cases in Guangdong were marked by four 
characteristics: First, cases in this category continued to 
rise. Second, there was an increase in the incidence of car and 
train robberies organized by gangs. Third, there was a growth 
in heinous armed robbery cases, with homicide involved. Fourth, 
many bandits ran away with help of cars, and they had 
intelligent and technical ways of committing crimes. (Hong Kong

Teleplay `The Hidden Front' To Be Shown During Spring Festival 
Period"] 
  [Text] The 10-part counter-espionage television series 
"Hidden Front," jointly produced by the Chinese Central 
Television Movie and Television Department and the Guangdong 
Television Station, will be shown on the second channel of 
Chinese Central Television during the spring festival period. 
Based on the struggle of our brave and resourceful scouts -- 
who uncovered a spy network that had lain low for 40 years and 
who frustrated the "Emperor's Sister Plan," according to which 
enemy spies sneaked into China to steal secret information under 
the command of the "intelligence king" -- the teleplay vividly 
reproduces the soul-stirring fight between China's national 
security organs and hostile forces outside its borders since the 
reform and opening-up policy were introduced, through a true 
story and complicated plots. The teleplay was conducted by 
well-known conductors Ding Yinnan, Zhao Wenxin, and Ma Zhongyi, 
and was written by Ma.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- China will launch seven 
satellites this year, a record year for satellite launching. 
  Except for "SJ-4" ["Shijian-4"], a space probing satellite, 
and a simulated satellite, which were successfully launched 
today, the other six are "FY-2" ["Fengyun-2'] meteorological 
satellite, "DFH-3" ["Dongfanghong-3"] communications satellite, 
a satellite for scientific exploration and technological 
experimentation, all of which were developed and manufactured by 
China; "Asia-Pacific-1" and "Asia-Pacific-2" satellites, 
operated by the Asia-Pacific Satellite Company; and Australia's 
"Aussat B-3" satellite. 
  According to a briefing by relevant experts, in the 
launching 
of the abovementioned satellites, new models, different types, 
complex performance, and high technological demand are their 
characteristics. Some satellites represent the popularization 
and application of mature technology, others signal the opening 
up of new technology and a new domain; some are for experiments 
ascending to a new level; and others mark an important move by 
China to ensure its place in the world domain of high science 
and technology. Among them, the "SJ-4" space probing satellite, 
which was launched by the "Long-March 3A" carrier rocket, was 
launched for the first time on an experimental basis -- as will 
the other second-generation applied satellites, such as the 
"FY-2" meteorological satellite" and the "DFH-3" communications 
satellite.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Feb (XINHUA) -- The "SJ-4" [Shijian-4] 
satellite, which was successfully sent into space on 8 February 
1994, has entered its prearranged large, flat orbit. 
Researchers at the Space and Applied Research Center of the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences said that ground control received 
the satellite's remote measurement signals at 0423 [2023 GMT] on 
9 February immediately after the satellite entered China's 
airspace for the first time. Initial scientific data has been 
obtained following the decoding of some signals indicating that 
the six scientific probing instruments on board have started 
working normally. 
  According to a person in charge at the Space and Applied 
Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences who had just 
returned to Beijing from the Xichang Satellite Launching Center, 
the "SJ-4" is China's first special large, flat, 
high-altitude-orbit satellite designed to study the space 
environment and its effects [as received]. Immediately after 
the satellite entered orbit, the Satellite Measurement and 
Control Center of the State Commission of Science, Technology, 
and Industry for National Defense captured the satellite's 
remote measurement signals and measured the satellite's orbit. 
The satellite's greatest altitude from the earth is 36,133 km, 
its lowest altitude from the earth is 217 km, and its dip angle 
is 28.58 degrees. On 12 February, the Measurement and Control 
Center began an experiment which applied high pressure on its 
static analyzer remote control. Monitoring and measuring data 
indicated that the high pressure applied on instruments was 
normal and that the instruments had begun to sent back 
space-plasma data. Now, all the probing instruments on board 
have been put into normal operation. 
  With the special characteristics of the present orbit of the 
"SJ- 4" the major purpose of the "SJ-4" is to probe and study 
charged particles in near-earth space and their effects on space 
vehicles. Its obtaining of systematic environmental data will 
help boost our country's research into the plasma environment. 
The successful launch of the "SJ-4" is helping to accumulate 
experience in using our country's powerful carrier rockets to 
launch applied satellites and in using experimental rockets to 
carry small scientific research satellites.

<F P=106> [By GUANGMING RIBAO reporter Lin Ying (2651 5391) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- At a national conference 
on environmental protection that closed today, State Councillor 
Song Jian pointed out: It is necessary to promote the 
development of China's environmental law system more quickly and 
vigorously, and emphasize investigations in environmental law 
enforcement this year. This is the most fundamental measure for 
implementing various environmental policies and plans. 
  Song Jian said: To promote the development of the 
environmental law system, it is first necessary to quicken and 
perfect legislation, such as the enactment of regulations on 
natural preserves, laws preventing solid waste pollution, and 
other environmental protection laws. Meanwhile, localities 
should also quickly enact local environmental protection laws. 
Second, it is necessary to strengthen supervision in law 
enforcement. For governments at all levels to realistically 
shoulder law enforcement responsibilities, government 
organizations and leaders must take the lead. Environmental 
control is the government's fundamental function, while 
environmental departments are representatives of the government 
in enforcing environmental protection laws. This is the mission 
empowered by the law, and the departments must be bold and 
strict in enforcing it. If we do not undertake effective 
environmental protection measures, heavy pollution will affect 
people's production and lives, and it will be impossible to 
maintain social stability and progress. 
  Song Jian said: The enforcement of environmental protection 
laws will be investigated in over a dozen provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions this year. Localities 
must also conduct their own law enforcement investigations. 
These investigations should focus on checking and penalizing 
serious violators of the environmental protection law. 
Seriously harmful souces of pollution will be closed down, 
while others will be given deadlines to undertake remedial 
measures. We must also include biodiversity in our work this 
year as there are many problems in this respect. We must 
strengthen our control over environmental problems caused by 
village and town enterprises. For example, we must not allow 
the heavy pollution caused by small paper mills in the upper 
reaches of the Huai He to continue. 
  It is learned that the "Ninth Five-Year Program" on 
environmental protection as well as the 2010 long-term 
environmental protection and development plan will be formulated 
this year. The environmental program for adjoining regions of 
Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia as well as the pollution 
prevention program for the Three Gorges Dam region on the Chang 
Jiang will also be drawn up. In addition, comprehensive plans on 
acid rain prevention will be developed. An investigation and 
sewage disposal registration system will be implemented for 
tertiary industries such as the catering and service sectors. 
Meanwhile, environmental control in rural areas will be 
strengthened; pollution caused by village and town enterprises 
and its control will be investigated; and namelists of village 
and town enterprises nationwide as well as regions causing 
serious pollution will be announced. To further promote our 
country's environmental protection work, international 
cooperation will be actively sought and international 
conventions, of which China is a member, will be earnestly 
implemented.

  [Text] Nanning, February 16 (XINHUA) -- Construction is due 
to start on the Longtan Hydroelectric Power Station, on the 
Hongshui River in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region. 
  Cheng Kejie, chairman of the region, told reporters that the 
hydropower station is believed to be second only to the 
projected Three Gorges Hydropower Station in scale, and when it 
is completed it will be the second-biggest in Asia. 
  During the first-phase construction, a water control dam 
with 
a height of 375 m [meters] will be built, and seven generating 
units with a total generating capacity of 4.2 million kw will be 
installed. When this phase is completed the hydropower station 
will generate 15.67 billion kwh of electricity a year, according 
to Cheng. 
  During the second-phase construction, two more generating 
units, with an aggregate generating capacity of 5.4 million kw, 
will be installed. 
  The entire project will require a total investment of 30 
billion yuan (about 3.448 billion U.S. dollars), of which 970 
million U.S. dollars will be provided in the form of World Bank 
loans. 
  The chairman explained that the station will not only 
provide 
more electricity for Guangxi, but also play a positive role in 
fighting flooding on the lower reaches of the Hongshui River. 
  He said that the new hydropower station will be jointly 
built 
by the State Energy Investment Corporation, Guizhou and 
Guangdong Provinces and Guangxi. 
  Guangxi will bear 25 percent of the total investment needed 
and will be able to use 50 percent of the electricity to be 
generated. 
  The Hongshui River abounds in hydroelectric resources. The 
State Council has approved the building of ten stepped 
hydropower stations, with a total generating capacity of 11 
million kw. 
  Construction has started on most of these hydropower 
stations; four of them have finished their first phases and are 
already transmitting electricity. 
  The chairman added that local departments are already busy 
with the preparatory work, including the building of highways 
leading to the construction site, for the formal launching of 
the Longtan Hydropower Station Project.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 </F>
1627): China Has Decided That the Authorities Will Purchase 
Grain to Control Grain Sources and Guarantee Stable Grain 
Prices"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Feb (WEN WEI PO)--An authoritative 
source here has leaked word that the central authorities have 
decided that from now on grain can only be purchased by state 
grain departments, that grain purchasing prices can only be 
fixed by the state, and that no businessman is allowed to 
purchase grain in order to guarantee that the price of grain -- 
a special, fundamental commodity -- will remain stable. 
  The authoritative source quoted the central policy 
decisionmaking body as saying that the central authorities, 
which have drawn a lesson from last November's sharp increase in 
grain prices, maintained that the retail prices of grain can be 
freed in the future. The grain sources, however, must be 
controlled by the state rather than by small tradespeople and 
peddlers, because China's is a big socialist market, and the 
normal market order will be easily jeopardized by small 
tradespeople and peddlers if they are allowed to purchase grain. 
  The central authorities made it clear that, in order to 
carry 
out the state policy for keeping grain prices stable, the state 
grain departments will in the future be in charge of 
policy-related grain purchases while joining businessmen in 
selling grain at retail prices. 
  To carry out the above policy, the State Council called a 
national conference on matters related to the "shopping basket" 
and grain, cotton, and oil. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji presided 
over the conference. 
  Premier Li Peng said at the meeting: The present situation 
with agricultural production and market supply is good in 
general. There have been bumper harvests for years running, and 
the "shopping basket" project has achieved remarkable results. 
The total supply of farm produce -- foodstuffs in particular -- 
which had fallen short for quite some time, is comparatively 
ample now. Under such a good situation, however, fluctuations 
in the prices of grain, oil, and non-staple foods were seen in 
certain regions for a period following last November. The 
fluctuations were caused by many factors. But the most 
important factor, in my view, was that we lacked an adequate 
understanding of the need to exercise macrocontrol over the 
market under the new situation of lifting price controls. The 
current meeting is designed to seek unity in thinking, sum up 
positive and negative experiences, and find ways for our work on 
the "shopping basket" project and on grain, cotton, and oil to 
meet the demands of the socialist market economy. 
  He pointed out: China will make major strides in reform by 
introducing important reform measures this year. Whether we can 
smoothly carry out these major reform measures will have a 
bearing on the success or failure of the reform and a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. To 
carry out reform successfully, it is necessary to maintain 
social stability and reassure the people. We must make great 
efforts to keep prices relatively stable, especially the prices 
of grain, oil, meat, vegetables, and eggs. 
  He continued: We must take into account the interests of 
people of all social strata in deepening reform. China's reform 
accords with the fundamental interests of the overwhelming 
majority of the people. In the course of reform, however, it is 
unlikely that each stratum or each person will gain the same 
interests and same substantial profits at the same time. 
Therefore, in doing our work we must take special care of the 
people who are not well off for the time being, especially those 
who are still leading a rather difficult life. 
  Li Peng said: At present, to control the farm produce 
market, we should do a good job in three respects. First, we 
should be careful to establish a system of reserves to regulate 
the prices of staple agricultural products, including grain, 
cotton, oil, meat, vegetables, and sugar; second, we should 
establish a system of market risk funds for grain and non-staple 
foods; and third, we should establish a system for supervising 
and controlling farm produce markets and strengthen the 
construction of a network providing information on farm produce. 
  Li Peng added: I have repeatedly stressed that governments 
in various localities, especially governments of large and 
medium cities, must be put in charge of the "shopping basket" 
project and that a responsibility system should be introduced 
under which mayors are held responsible for the project. The 
mayor must regard making adequate arrangements for the people's 
daily life his priority task, because this is a matter of prime 
importance for maintaining overall stability. This should be 
made a requirement of the mayors' responsibility system. The 
mayors' performance should be appraised every year, and the 
results should be reported to the relevant city people's 
congresses and all citizens.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter from Hong Kong: "Wages in Mainland China </F>
Rise by an Average of 36 Percent"] 
  [Text] Mainland China completed its wage reform before the 
Spring Festival and gave a big Spring Festival gift to 
approximately 38 million servicemen, cadres, and teachers who 
were included in the wage reform so they could spend a 
"harmonious" Spring Festival. 
  Wage reform, which had been discussed and planned for a long 
time, was originally introduced with the civil service system. 
Due to the current high inflation, the grim economic situation, 
and the heavy tasks of reform, however, the CPC senior 
leadership decided at the end of last year that wage reform for 
cadres, servicemen, and teachers should be sped up and that it 
should be completed before the Spring Festival so as to maintain 
the stability of the "backyard" [hou yuan 0683 7108]. 
  Following the wage reform, Jiang Zemin has become the 
official who receives the highest income. Of the many titles he 
holds, he receives his salary with the highest-paying title of 
the Central Military Commission chairman, a monthly income of 
1,600 yuan. 
  This time, there were not many new elements in the wage 
reform. It still determines pay scales with such indexes as 
seniority, post, and technical title; the higher the position, 
the higher the wages. 
  The wage reform's increase rate was 36 percent on average. 
The troops had higher rates than those for officials in the 
localities, and cadres had slightly higher rates than those for 
teachers. In the wake of the reform, high-ranking military 
officers and officials at the local ministerial level receive 
approximately 1,000 yuan; field officers and cadres at the local 
department or bureau level receive approximately 700 yuan, and 
cadres at and below the sectional level and general teachers 
receive approximately 400 yuan. The wage gap has obviously 
widened. 
  The wage reform was implemented at a time of rather large 
financial difficulties. For the 3 million troops, the state had 
to spend approximately 3 billion yuan and for the 30 million 
cadres and teachers, it had to spend another 20 billion yuan or 
so; so that their wages are paid according to the new pay scale 
retroactive to October 1993. 
  There are advantages and disadvantages in wage reform. The 
advantages are that it has stabilized the long shaky moral of 
the troops and the general moral of cadres and teachers. But 
its disadvantages seem to outnumber the advantages. First, at a 
time when organizational reform has not been completed and when 
organizations are overstaffed, wage reform has not succeeded in 
improving work efficiency. Second, under the current social 
situation, it will inevitably lead to competition and spark off 
big increases in wages. For large numbers of loss-making 
state-owned enterprises particularly, it will lead to rising 
labor costs and accelerate financial difficulties while their 
efficiency does not seem to improve. Third, the substantial 
wage increases will accelerate inflation. At a time when China 
is a the buyer's market, an increase in the currency that people 
hold in their hands will pave the way for a worsening economy.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The 10 
institutes of higher learning in Beijing plan to adopt a new 
policy: Full-time college students enrolled this year will have 
to pay their tuition fees. 
  The individual in charge of the Beijing Office of the 
Institutes of Higher Learning said that these 10 institutes are: 
Beijing University, Qinghua University, Chinese People's 
University, Beijing Teachers' University, Beijing Foreign 
Studies University, Beijing College of Architectural 
Engineering, United College of Tourism, Central Institute of 
Fine Arts, Central Conservatory of Music, and Beijing College of 
Linguistics. 
  According to the authorities concerned, the payment amount 
will be based on a certain ratio of the educational cost. The 
annual tuition fees for full time students are between 1,000 and 
1,500 yuan. 
  Concerned personnel pointed out that, in pushing for this 
reform, the 10 institutes must establish and perfect a 
scholarship and student loan system. Teachers' and specialized 
institutes in disadvantaged circumstances will be given 
government support. Graduates from these institutes will benefit 
from preferential policies.

<F P=106> ["Review and Outlook" column by Jiang Ying (1203 5391) and </F>
Gan Hongtao (3927 3163 3447): "Auto Industry Heads for New 
Development"] 
  [Text] [photo shows Mao Zedong standing with four 
unidentified people looking at a car] This is a valuable 
historical photo. The date is 21 May 1958, and Comrade Mao 
Zedong is in Huairentang of Zhongnanhai, looking with great 
interest at "Dongfeng," our country's first domestically 
produced sedan. He later said happily: Finally I can ride in a 
sedan that we manufactured. (the photo above) 
  But people in the know know that the sedan did not come from 
a modern assembly line, but was a sample car that was "hammered 
out" by highly skilled mechanics. The hand-crafted work was 
produced and presented to Comrade Mao Zedong as a token "gift" 
for the "Great Leap Forward." 
  Back then, the assembly line only produced trucks. For a 
long time, any discussion of China's auto industry was actually 
about the country's truck industry. There was a saying which 
characterized the situation well: "A lack of light (vehicles), 
a shortage of heavy-duty (vehicles), and no sedans whatsoever." 
  Thirty-five years have passed. Having started from scratch 
and expanded to a great scale, China's auto industry has made 
enormous achievements. 
  In particular, in the 15 years of reform and opening up, 
China's auto industry grew at a high annual rate of 19 percent, 
with its output volume jumping from 185,000 in 1979 to 1.28 
million vehicles in 1993. The output volume of last year alone 
was four times the total volume of the 30 years prior to reform. 
The total output value rose from 7.2 billion yuan in 1981 to 
120 billion yuan in 1993, one third of the total output value of 
the entire machinery industry. The auto industry was launched 
in the 1980's; its output volume rose from 5,000 in 1985 to 
225,000 in 1993, a 32-fold increase over eight years. For the 
last 15 years, through joint ventures and cooperation, the auto 
industry has imported 200 various advanced technologies and has 
initiated 126 joint-capital firms. Direct foreign investment has 
amounted to over $900 million, and all automobile products have 
introduced new models and have offered new ranges of models. 
There are now a dozen auto-production bases, such as those that 
produce the Jiefang, Dongfeng, Heavy-Duty, and Nanqi models in 
the country's capital, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. China 
now can produce 103 ranges of basic car models, from heavy-duty, 
medium, and light-duty to mini types, and 750 types of 
specialized and remodeled vehicles. Manufacturing standards, 
product quality, and management levels have all entered a new 
stage. 
  The 14th Party Congress proposed speeding up the development 
of the auto industry as a pillar industry for the national 
economy. Between now and the end of this century will be a 
critical period for our auto industry, which will take on key 
development problems. During this time, the auto industry will 
increase investment, will work to create as quickly as possible 
a number of business conglomerates capable of responding to the 
two markets which are internationally competitive, and will 
establish an independent product development system with 
decisionmaking powers. By 2010, the industry will be producing 
6 million vehicles annually. The economical sedan, most 
suitable for carrying the whole family, will be the leading 
product. 
  Most encouragingly, the state is going to unveil an 
industrial policy designed to speed up the development of the 
auto industry. At the same time, car business groups are 
pursuing a "power-power" [qiang qiang 1730 1730] type of joint 
venture which links up different enterprises, regions, 
industries, and departments, with all partners investing jointly 
to import new and high technologies. For China's auto industry, 
today is a historical turning point. It signifies the end of 
isolated and disparate management and the repetitive imports and 
projects that have long plagued auto production. China's auto 
industry will finally be on its way to a high technological 
starting point, mass production, specialization, and production 
based on economies of scale and will enjoy healthy and rapid 
development. (The photo to the left: the general assembly line

Opinions of State Economic and Trade Commission, MOFTEC, and 
Domestic Trade Ministry on Delegating Power in Import and Export 
Operations to Commercial and Material Supply Enterprises on a 
Trial Basis--State Council Document No 76, 1993"] 
  [Text] To all provincial, autonomous regional, and 
municipal people's governments, ministries, commissions, and 
organizations directly under the jurisdiction of the State 
Council: 
  The State Council approves the "Opinions on the Delegation 
of 
Power in Import and Export Operations to Commercial and Material 
Supply Enterprises on a Trial Basis" of the State Economic and 
Trade Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation [MOFTEC], and the Ministry of Internal Trade [MIT]. 
We hereby relay this document to you; please implement it 
accordingly. 
  Delegating import and export powers to commercial and 
material supply enterprises is one important measure to deepen 
circulation restructuring, expand opening up, augment the 
vitality of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and 
quicken pace of developing tertiary industry. All localities 
and related departments may select some large and medium-sized 
commercial and material supply enterprises that fall in line 
with the conditions of the experiment based on the opinions of 
the three ministries on the implementation of the measures on a 
trial basis in different stages and batches in an active, sure, 
and steady way. 
  The State Economic and Trade Commission, MOFTEC, and the MIT 
should promptly summarize experiences in delegating powers to 
commercial and material supply enterprises on a trial basis and 
earnestly resolve enterprises' problems which surface in 
unfolding exports to push the smooth progress of this work on a 
trial basis. 
  PRC State Council 
  4 November 1993 
  ANNEX 
<H3>  Several Opinions on Delegating Powers of Import and Export 
Operation to Commercial and Material Supply Enterprises </H3>
  Based on the spirit of the "Resolution of the Central 
Committee and the State Council on Quickening the Pace of 
Developing Tertiary Industry" and the State Council's 
requirements on selecting large and medium-sized commercial and 
material supply enterprises where conditions are mature to 
delegate import and export operational powers to them on a trial 
basis, we hereby set out several opinions on this issue as 
follows: 
<H3>  I. Principles for Delegating Powers of Import and Export to 
Commercial and Material Supply Enterprises </H3>
  1. Delegating powers of import and export operations to 
commercial and material supply enterprises on a trial basis aims 
chiefly at deepening restructuring of circulation, expanding 
opening up, and augmenting the vigor of large and medium-sized 
state-owned commercial and material supply enterprises to 
quicken the development of tertiary industry. 
  2. First, it is necessary to select a small number of 
commercial (including commercial, grain, supply and marketing) 
and material supply enterprises, with comparatively satisfactory 
economic returns and a certain foundation in import and export 
work, to delegate powers to them on a trial basis. 
  3. To enable work in this aspect to be conducted in an 
active, sure, and steady way, when determining an enterprise to 
conduct import and export operations on a trial basis, it is 
necessary to conform with the actual conditions of China's 
commercial and material supply enterprises; at the same time, it 
is imperative to take into consideration the present conditions 
of China's foreign economic and trade structure in conducting 
examination and approval and strictly abide by the stipulated 
conditions. 
  4. While chiefly examining an enterprise's own conditions, 
it is imperative to give appropriate consideration to the 
distribution of trades and regions in selecting enterprises for 
the experiment. 
  5. Commercial and material supply enterprises granted powers 
of import and export operation (limited to experimental 
commercial and material supply enterprises as follows) should 
achieve a basic balance, and the scope of their import and 
export operations should be unanimous with the approved scope of 
their domestic operations. In principle, experimental commercial 
and material supply enterprises should refrain from operating in 
commodities imported with central foreign exchange in unified 
joint operations stipulated by the state. Commercial retail 
enterprises are not to participate in wholesale operations for 
imported commodities or act as agents for imported commodities; 
an enterprise's import volume should not exceed the annual sum 
of hard currency it brings in. 
  6. Experimental commercial and material supply enterprises 
should take up the task of bringing in hard currency issued by 
the state and handing over hard currency to the central 
treasury, report and submit statistical materials to responsible 
economic and trade departments according to the regulations, and 
accept guidance and supervision of the departments in charge of 
import and export operations, while subordinating themselves to 
the coordination of related import and export commercial 
chambers. Experimental commercial and material supply 
enterprises enjoy the same treatment as foreign trade 
enterprises in state import and export policy. 
  7. In principle, powers of import and export will be 
directly delegated to those commercial and material supply 
enterprises who apply for the experiments; in general, no other 
foreign trade companies will be examined and approved. 
<H3>  II. Conditions Which Experimental Commercial, Material 
Supply Enterprises Must Fulfill </H3>
  1. They must be economic bodies with the government and 
enterprise separated, operating on their own, and assuming sole 
responsibility for their own profits and losses. The core 
enterprise of the enterprise group must implement unified 
control over enterprises in its inner circle, and general 
companies (including joint companies) should do likewise 
regarding those enterprises directly under their jurisdiction. 
  2. They must own permanent operational sites as well as the 
installations and funds needed for unfolding import and export 
operations, and they must have complete and healthy internal 
organizations and professionals in foreign trade and technology 
corresponding to import and export operations. 
  3. Material supply and commercial wholesale enterprises 
directly under departments and in the coastal areas should 
import a minimum of 1 billion yuan of commodities each year, and 
material supply and commercial wholesale enterprises in the 
hinterland must import a minimum of 300 million yuan. 
  4. With regard to those material supply and commercial 
wholesale enterprises mainly operating in electrical machinery 
products directly under the jurisdiction of departments and in 
the coastal areas, they must accomplish a minimum annual import 
and export volume of 600 million yuan, and the minimum annual 
import and export volume in the hinterland must be 200 million 
yuan. 
  5. The minimum annual import and export volume of commercial 
retail enterprises must be 300 million yuan. 
  6. Generally, the export volume should not be less than 
one-third of the aforesaid import and export volume. 
  7. Taking into consideration the realities of China's 
commercial and material supply enterprises, when their import 
and export volumes fail to meet the aforesaid standards, their 
marketing volumes may be regarded as their reference figures for 
the initial stage of the experiment. 
  8. Regarding those commercial retail enterprises who 
specialize in Chinese commodities and stores which have already 
opened in the former USSR, Eastern Europe, and other peripheral 
countries, powers of barter trade may be delegated to those 
which have established such enterprises in those countries. 
<H5>  III. Procedures For Application, Examination, and Approval </H5>
  1. Applications for local enterprises should be sent to the 
State Economic and Trade Commission, MOFTEC, and the MIT by 
economic commissions and economic and trade commissions (foreign 
trade administrations) of all provinces, autonomous regions, 
municipalities, and cities with individual listings in plans. 
  2. Applications for enterprises directly under jurisdiction 
should be sent to the State Economic and Trade Commission, 
MOFTEC, and the MIT by the various responsible departments. 
  3. Materials which should be included in the application 
are: A report on the feasibility of the enterprise operating in 
imports and exports, the opinions of the responsible 
administrative department on the enterprise, the operational 
conditions of the enterprise in the previous two years (State 
Statistics Bureau or local statistics bureau's original 
statistics) and its actual results in imports and exports, the 
enterprise legal person operational license, the enterprise's 
actual funds situation, and a catalogue of the import and export 
commodities of the applicant enterprise. 
  4. After the MIT receives the applications from various 
localities and departments, it will set out its opinions on its 
preliminary examinations to the State Economic and Trade 
Commission, which will examine the applications of enterprises 
sent by departments and localities, then it will submit its 
opinions on those enterprises that fall in to line with MOFTEC's 
conditions, which will examine and give its official written 
reply.

  [Text] Beijing, February 15 (CNS) -- Vice Minister of 
Agriculture, Mr. Hong Fuzeng, speaking in an interview with this 
agency, said that China now was implementing the "Green 
Project", a huge programme to train 160 million farmers in 
agricultural technology in the broad rural areas of the country. 
  Mr. Hong, also vice chairman of the Jiu San society (one of 
the eight democratic parties in China) and in charge of this 
project, said that there were three methods for teaching farmers 
agricultural technology. The first is to train a contingent of 
laborers with technology through popularizing agricultural 
science and technology among farmers. The second is to give 160 
million farmers who now have middle school education a 
qualifying certificate in the "Green Project" after its 
implementation, enabling them to take a lead in agricultural 
production, and the third is to develop a contingent of 
agricultural management cadres and technicians for townships and 
villages by giving them technical secondary education. 
  According to Mr. Hong, the "Green Project" was now being 
implemented in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and 
municipalities with more than 300 trial counties and over 
200,000 participants taking part while over 60,000 have already 
been awarded the certificate of the "Green Project". By the 
year 2000, farmers receiving this kind of education will number 
8 million to 10 million, enabling every 20 farming households to 
have one backbone farmer amongst them with the practical rate of 
agricultural scientific and technological results raised to 
between 60 percent to 70 percent, up from the present 30 percent 
to 40 percent. 
  In addition to the implementation of this project, another 
important measure for the reform of agriculture in the country 
is to practice ecological agriculture. Agriculture in China is 
now facing a number of problems such as increasing environmental 
pollution, the worsening of water quality in coastal areas, the 
deteriorating ecological environment, the shortage of resources, 
the increasing of population and the increasing of the burden 
placed on agriculture. Regarding this situation, seven 
ministries and commissions under the State Council will, 
together with relevant provinces, autonomous regions and 
municipalities, engage in the construction of ecological 
agriculture in 50 counties from this year to 1997, in order to 
create ecological agriculture with Chinese characteristics in 
the country.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Beijing: "Township and Town </F>
Enterprises Face Five Major Crises"] 
  [Text] According to surveys conducted by the department 
concerned, township and town enterprises on the Chinese mainland 
are facing the following five major crises: 
  --Crisis of mechanism. State-owned enterprises currently 
have decisionmaking powers and a more flexible operational 
mechanism. The market mechanism has given the state-owned 
enterprises an opportunity to compete with township and town 
enterprises on an equal basis, thus weakening the flexibility of 
the latter's economic mechanism. Furthermore, because their 
operational mechanism has yet to be perfected, the 
competitiveness of township and town enterprises has been 
seriously weakened. 
  --Crisis of dependence. Most township and town enterprises 
attach themselves to large enterprises in the cities for 
coordinated or joint processing. Due to their processing 
nature, their economic patterns, management methods, techniques, 
equipment, and technical personnel have become fixed over a long 
period. For this reason, they tend to depend heavily on others, 
giving rise to the lack of competition and risk concepts. 
  --Crisis of management. Not having received systematic and 
regular basic training, most directors, managers, and managerial 
personnel from township and town enterprises cannot do as much 
as they wish in the face of an unpredictable market. 
  --Crisis of science and technology. In the past, scientists 
and technicians worked for township and town enterprises because 
they were upbeat about the flexibility of the latter's 
operational mechanism. After being invigorated, state-owned 
enterprises have an edge over township and town enterprises in 
terms of scientific research expenses and conditions. As a 
result, the shortage of talented personnel facing township and 
town enterprises will become worse. 
  --Crisis of products. Township and town enterprises are 
generally plagued by problems of outmoded equipment, crude 
technology, and backward techniques. Moreover, due to the 
constraints of funds, technology, and other factors, they are 
obviously inferior to state-owned enterprises in terms of 
upgrading products.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814): "Reform Has </F>
Liberated the Most Active Factor of Productive Forces -- The 
Lesson of Our Country's Grain Output Increasing by Leaps and 
Bounds"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Feb (XINHUA) -- Despite a decreasing 
amount of arable land, our country's total grain output reached 
456.4 billion kg in 1993, thus exceeding the previous record 
high by 10.2 billion kg. These figures signify that our 
country's overall grain production capability has stabilized to 
reach the level of producing 450 billion kg annually. 
  China's grain output has jumped by leaps and bounds over the 
past 15 years, increasing from 300 billion kg in 1979 to 450 
billion kg in 1993. Fifteen years is a very brief period in the 
long history of humans. The sharp increase in grain output over 
the 15 years represented a quantum jump in the several thousand 
years of history of farming in China. It is exactly because of 
this quantum jump in grain production that the Chinese people 
have realized the dream of having attained the sufficiency in 
food and clothing that had long eluded our ancestors. 
  With only 7 percent of the world's arable land, China has 
solved the problem of feeding and clothing 22 percent of the 
world's people. This undoubtedly represents a great 
contribution to the entire human existence and development, and 
it has surprised the entire world. According to a foreign 
economist's analysis, between 1980 and 1991, China contributed 
20 kg out of every 50 kg of the increase in the world's gross 
grain production. The same foreign economist observed: "It is a 
miracle in the history of the world economy; it is simply 
incredible." 
  This is a towering monument to bountifulness erected by 
China's 900 million farmers on some 1.4 billion mu of farmland. 
The most fundamental reason behind it is the reform that has 
liberated the most active factor for productive forces -- human 
beings. 
<H5>  (1) </H5>
  When New China resolutely parted with the old age, which had 
lasted for thousands of years and which was a synonym for hunger 
and poverty, it failed to establish a set of excellent operating 
mechanisms that could effectively encourage production and help 
increase the market supply. Possessing neither the right to 
manage the land nor to manage the produce, farmers' enthusiasm 
for production was greatly dampened. From 1957 to 1978, a span 
of 21 years, our country's per capita annual increase in grain 
production was less than 0.6 kg. This cruel reality had forced 
the state to practice a rationing system for the supply of some 
staple agricultural products. By 1978, when the Republic marked 
its 29th anniversary, there were still more than 200 million 
people in the nation struggling against hunger. 
  "If people go hungry, can we call this socialism?" In 
December 1978, farmers in Xiaogan village, in Fengyang County, 
Anhui, while running the risk of being thrown into prison, 
ignited the spark of the contract responsibility system and 
unveiled the curtain on rural reform. The spark spread 
throughout the nation and in one stroke reversed the stagnation 
that had long affected the agricultural sector. In 1982, the 
total national grain output reached 354 billion kg, an increase 
of about 50 billion kg over 1978. By 1984, the nation's gross 
grain output increased to 407.30 billion kg, a further increase 
of 50 billion kg from 1982, and the per capita possession of 
grain reached 400 kg, thus nearing the world's average level for 
the first time. 
  Farmers elatedly hummed tunes while harvesting. Ordinary 
people, however, were puzzled by the agricultural miracle that 
the farmers had helped to create. They noted that before the 
introduction of the reform, the emphasis on "taking agriculture 
as the key link" had been repeated time and again and that 800 
million farmers were bound to the earth for farming. Despite 
all this, grain production remained stagnant. Following the 
introduction of the contract responsibility system, not only 
grain production posted sharp increases but the production of 
other agricultural sideline products, forestry products, animal 
husbandry products, and aquatic products also registered great 
increases. 
  An economist had the following explanation: A comparison 
between 1949 and 1952 showed that because of farmers' heightened 
enthusiasm for production due to farmland having been 
distributed to them, they helped boost overall annual grain 
production by 13 percent. However, we miscalculated the 
situation, thinking that collective farming would bring about 
higher efficiency than family-style operations. Farmland 
operations were then turned into collective and unified 
operations, and areas of farming activities that were put under 
control were further expanded. Because laborers, who in the 
first place should be the most active factor of the productive 
forces, were "dead," the key production element for farming 
could not be "enlivened." The household contract responsibility 
system, which links remuneration with output, gave the farmers 
the right to manage the land. The benefit mechanism fired up 
farmers' enthusiasm for farming, which brought about creativity 
that was unthinkable in the times of people's communes. 
  Farmers had a simpler explanation: "After fulfilling the set 
quotas for the state and for the collectives, the rest is ours." 
The results of labor and the benefits for the producers were 
thus closely interlinked. The contract responsibility system 
elicited a sense of responsibility, inspired enthusiasm, and led 
to bumper harvests. 
<H5>  (2) </H5>
  Today, if we take a walk through urban and rural market 
places, we will find an abundant supply of grains, fowls, fish, 
meat, eggs, vegetables, and dairy products. There is a dazzling 
display of various lines of food products in stores. Following 
the successful solution of the basic problem of "filling the 
hungry stomachs" in the mid-eighties, we then entered a stage 
where we become particular about the nutrition, tastes, and 
varieties of what we eat. This shows the historical change that 
has occurred to grain varieties and product quality. 
  Production and consumption is an inseparable "pair." Market 
is an indispensable link between them. But before our country 
carried out the rural reform, the link was artificially cut off 
and the "pair" was separated. In the area of crop planting, 
people were told: "Plant as told." In the area of eating, 
people were told: "Eat whatever is available." Both producers 
and consumers lost the right of autonomy. 
  Reform finally dismantled the barrier that separated the 
producers and consumers and established a link for the market. 
From 1985, the year that saw the issuance of the CPC Central 
Committee Number 1 Document, which announced the reform of the 
system of the state's monopoly over grain purchase to the 
nineties which saw the lifting of controls on grain procurement 
and marketing, grain has entered the market as a commodity. 
Amid the gradual yet positive and steady reform, the market's 
role was recognized, market forces were constantly expanded, and 
market mechanisms were introduced one after another. 
  The opening of the market gave the right and room of 
maneuver 
for farmers to decide on production on their own. This 
undoubtedly is another liberation of the productive forces in 
rural areas. 
  Now, hundreds and thousands of farmers can hold their heads 
high. They plant crops with market demands in mind. They say: 
"I will plant whatever the market demands." In 1992, farmers 
in six provinces, including Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Fujian, 
riding on the crest of the tide of reform, reduced the acreage 
of long-grained nonglutinous rice which suffered sluggish sales 
on the market; instead, they increased the planting acreage of 
17.90 million mu of superior-quality rice. The following year, 
the craze to engage in "high-yield, high-quality, and 
high-efficiency farming" infected the entire nation. According 
to the Agriculture Ministry, the nation saw the shrinking of the 
planting acreage for long-grain nonglutinous rice by over 12 
million mu and the increase over 100 million mu of acreage for 
superior-quality rice in 1993; compared to the previous year, 
the acreage for superior-quality wheat was increased to over 3 
million mu; acreage for soya bean and other food grains was 
increased to over 34 million mu over the previous year. It may 
be said that the product quality and the structure of varieties 
of the current 450 billion kg of grain are far superior to those 
in the past. 
  "When the people are alive, the market gets enlivened, and 
the earth also awakes." The folks use the above simple yet 
concrete language to describe the truism that has brought about 
all the changes that have occurred so far. 
<H5>  (3) </H5>
  Capital, materials, and science and technology are three 
major factors for developing grain production. But these three 
major factors require the efforts of farmers. Increasing 
chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic sheeting output 
and widespread promotion of agricultural science and technology 
over the past 15 years have greatly contributed to the increase 
in grain production by leaps and bounds. 
  What gives us much food for thought is that prior to reform 
and opening up, there existed the same key elements for 
production and the same degree of importance had been attached 
to those key production elements. But they were like "a 
cesspool of dead water." 
  People still remember the policy of the "Eight-Point 
Character for Agriculture" proposed by Mao Zedong. However, 
even at Mao Zedong's personal prompting, it was difficult to put 
that Eight-Point policy into practice. The state invested a lot 
of funds into the agriculture, but they produced little results. 
Despite a lot of scientific achievements in those days, they 
failed to take root. 
  It's easy to find the reasons for the above problems. Under 
the shackles of the old system, farmers "started and stopped 
working at the sound of the whistle." They just did not care. 
As they did not have autonomy, they were powerless to make 
things move. They used to say: "What is the use of producing 
more grain?" 
  Reform has liberated millions and millions of farmers from 
the shackles of the old system. When this human factor becomes 
brisk, all other key elements for production will no longer 
remain in "a cesspool of dead water." Statistics show that in 
15 years of reform, the overall generating power of our 
country's farm machinery jumped 1.6 times, the number of 
tractors owned by farmers increased 3.4 times, trucks for 
farm-use grew 8.5 times, of which 80 percent of the growth in 
farm machinery came through farmers' purchases. The fact that 
hundreds and thousands of farming households' snapping up 
farm-machinery has brought about the following changes: Acreage 
plowed by farm machinery in China has increased 26 percent; 
acreage sown by farm machinery jumped 95 percent; and farmland 
harvested by farm machinery is up 3.5 times. 
  Reform and opening up have liberated the most active factor 
in the productive forces and enabled science and technology to 
display its power as the "primary productive force." When the 
prairie fire of the contract responsibility system swept through 
the great earth of central China, there were reports of news on 
people "fighting for the god of fortune." Now, the farmers' 
longing for science, technology, and talented people is the 
strongest of any time. They not only try every possible means 
to "fight for things that grow money," for "technology," and for 
"patent rights," but are willing to spend money to train "local 
talents." In just five years during the Seventh Five-Year Plan 
period, the acreage of China's cross-bred paddy rice fields was 
expanded from 100 million mu to 230 million; cross-bred corn 
field from 190 million mu to 270 million; and farmland covered 
by plastic sheeting from 31.50 million mu to 53 million. 
  When talking about the tremendous changes that had been 
brought to agriculture, farmers invariably attributed those 
changes to the party's good policies. They did not say that 
just to flatter the party; they really meant it. 
  The lesson from the grain output increasing by leaps and 
bounds over the past 15 years is: Human beings are the most 
active element of the productive forces. When the human factor 
gets activated, it will produce a chain reaction upon other key 
elements for production and lead to a situation where "one will 
try his or her best; things will serve their proper purpose; and 
the earth provides of its own accord."

"Enlightenment Gained From Grain Price Fluctuations"] 
  [Text] Grain prices in the south China market have been 
experiencing broad fluctuations recently, giving rise to great 
concern at various levels of the government. A series of 
regulatory and control measures has been implemented, and grain 
prices have now stabilized. 
  But what does this unanticipated round of grain price 
fluctuations mean? What lessons and experiences can we learn 
from the situation? People have not stopped pondering these 
questions since the grain prices stopped fluctuating. 
<H5>  The Problems Exposed by the Grain Price Fluctuations </H5>
  Last year, after restrictions on grain prices were lifted in 
the country, the peasants, who had experienced "difficulties in 
selling grain" for years, hoped that grain prices would increase 
but also feared that they could not be able to sell their grain. 
When the summer grain purchasing season arrived, the advantages 
to peasants brought about by the lifting of restrictions on 
grain prices and by the provision of many channels for 
purchasing grain became immediately apparent and peasants no 
longer worried about grain selling difficulties. Under these 
conditions, many peasants compared the prices offered by several 
purchasers and sold their grain to the one who offered the 
highest price. Particularly after the early crop witnessed a 
drop in output, the peasants became more reluctant to sell their 
grain at low prices. In this way, state-owned grain enterprises 
experienced "difficulties in purchasing grain," and this to some 
extent led to the illusion of a grain shortage. 
  State-owned grain enterprises contributed to the problem 
because they failed to adapt to the new situation when the 
restrictions on the grain market were lifted, and the number of 
loss-makers among them increased dramatically. The situation 
was exacerbated by the fact that many local governments cut 
financial subsidies to grain enterprises, and, therefore, grain 
enterprises also hoped to see an increase in grain prices in the 
market. 
  In addition, because the areas under grain cultivation in 
the 
coastal region in south China have decreased substantially, the 
market areas in the coastal region have approached the producing 
areas in central China to purchase grain and are competing with 
the grain-purchasing departments there, leading to an upsurge of 
prices in the grain market. 
  Experts pointed out that, following the lifting of the 
restrictions on the grain market, a moderate increase in grain 
prices is understandable and is also good for the development of 
grain production. In a bumper harvest year and during the 
autumn grain purchasing season, however, it is abnormal to see a 
great increase in grain prices, which even skyrocketed in some 
localities. The state has decided to increase the purchase price 
of grain this year, and a sharp increases in grain prices would 
be very unfavorable to stabilizing prices throughout the 
country. If the government still does not come out to intervene 
in the market at this time, the interests of the consumers will 
be badly harmed, and social stability and the overall situation 
of deepening reform will be affected. 
  When we reflect on the situation, the main motive forces 
behind thoroughly lifting the restrictions on the grain market 
last year were: Lifting the restrictions on selling prices in 
cities, changing the situation whereby purchasing prices were 
higher than selling prices, reducing the government's financial 
burden, and, through developing the market's role in regulating 
production, to arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for producing 
grain and increase grain supply for all of society. This 
original plan of "killing two birds with one stone" was not 
wrong. The problem was that, after the restrictions on the 
grain market were lifted, we failed to respond to the situation 
by quickly building a new protection system ensuring stability 
in grain supply and demand. 
  State-owned grain enterprises have been slow in changing 
their operational mechanisms, and they have been facing 
operational difficulties since the lifting of restrictions on 
the market. In many cities, the business volume of state-owned 
grain enterprises accounts for only one-third of grain supply in 
society. In the rural areas, being restrained by the system and 
certain policies, state-owned grain-purchasing departments also 
cannot compete with other grain purchasers who are operating 
within other channels. Following the lifting of restrictions on 
the grain market, this stripped the government of a "handle" on 
macro regulation and control. 
  On the government side, for various reasons, the money 
originally used as subsidies could not be transformed into risk 
funds as people have expected, and, therefore, some 
administrative means have been taken unavoidably. 
  Speaking in a certain sense, the price fluctuations in the 
grain market during a bumper harvest year have revealed the 
shortcomings of the grain market system and have pointed out the 
direction in which the reform of grain system should be deepened 
further. 
<H3>  "Cheap Grain Hurts the Peasants" and "Expensive Rice Hurts 
the People" </H3>
  What is noteworthy is that, within the government's 
regulation and control of the grain market, handling relations 
between the producers and the consumers is the most difficult 
problem. 
  "Cheap grain hurts the peasants," and this has been known to 
the people since ancient times. Throughout the history of China 
we can see the authorities resorting to a regulatory method in 
which they buy rice when its market price is too low and sell 
rice when its price has increased. We are currently reforming 
the centralized system for purchasing and selling grain and are 
marketizing grain production and operation. One of the major 
reasons for doing this is to increase returns from grain 
production and operation through the establishment of a new 
system in order to arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for 
production. 
  Generally speaking, at a time when the market is regulating 
the economy, production elements will usually flow toward the 
sectors which have high profit rates, whereas grain production 
has a relatively low profit, and grain supply can be ensured 
only when certain protection is given to the producers. Grain 
is not an ordinary commodity, and changes in the relations 
between supply and demand have a direct bearing on social 
stability; as the most basic necessity of life, grain is a 
strategic commodity which ensures the country's security. 
Therefore, even in developed countries, grain production and 
operation is not purely marketized. To a big country such as 
ours -- which has 1.1 billion people, 200 million peasant 
households, and a comparatively weak agricultural production 
foundation -- the degree of difficulty in marketization of grain 
production and operation will be even greater. 
  Experts maintain that the government's regulation and 
control 
over grain, which is a special commodity, is difficult because 
it cannot just "take care of one aspect." When grain prices in 
the market are low and "cheap grain hurts the peasants," it will 
eventually lead to inadequate production and a rapid increase in 
grain prices; when grain prices in the market are too high and 
are breaking the consumers' backbones, not only will there be a 
cobweb effect in the market and social instability, but the 
sharp increase and decrease will distort market signals, lead to 
an unbalanced agricultural production structure, create new 
"difficulties in selling grain," and eventually bring 
disadvantages to producers. 
  Therefore, after restrictions have been lifted from the 
grain 
market, we must build a forceful, authoritative, and keenly 
responsive system as quickly as possible to exercise 
macroregulation and control over the market, and to carry out 
flexible regulation at any time depending on fluctuations of 
grain prices in the market; this is the correct way to properly 
handle the relations among producers, operators, and consumers 
on the premise of protecting the peasants' enthusiasm for 
growing grain. 
<H5>  The Market Calls for a New Regulatory and Control System </H5>
  After analyzing the fluctuations of grain prices this time 
and the experience of the 15 years of reform, economists have 
pointed out that, in a big country such as China, in order to 
ensure the stability of the grain market, the government must 
build a regulatory and control system which is forceful, 
authoritative, and responsive to changes in the market 
situation. In particular, attention must be paid to properly 
protecting the interests of producers. Because, from a 
long-term perspective, the shortage of grain supply will be the 
main contradiction; in the short term, relative and regional 
surpluses will be a secondary contradiction. In concrete 
terms, in the areas of grain purchasing, grain selling, and 
market regulation and control, the government must build a whole 
set of systems which adapt to the new situation and are in line 
with the country's conditions. 
  Experts have pointed out that, following the lifting of 
restrictions on the market, the government's purchasing behavior 
-- how much it purchases and at what price -- will have a direct 
impact on the economic behavior and economic interests of the 
main body of the market. Therefore, the government will still 
be the most crucial factor contributing to market stability. 
Whereas the building of a reserve system is the core of the 
building of a grain system as well as an important means by 
which the government can regulate, control, and intervene in the 
market. 
  A complete state grain reserve system should at least 
include 
the following aspects: A price protection system, a grain risk 
fund system, a grain reserve system participating in 
international grain trade system, and a system of targeted 
subsidies. 
  The price protection system is the government's most 
important tool for protecting peasants and regulating the 
interests of various quarters of the market. After the lifting 
of restrictions on the market, there will be fluctuations in the 
market every year, and the government's duty is to buy the 
peasants' grain at protected prices when market prices are too 
low to protect the interest of the producers; when market prices 
are too high, the government will release to the market grain 
that was purchased at protected prices, to check the upsurge of 
grain prices and protect the interest of the consumers. The 
price protection system must be supported by the grain risk fund 
system. The size of the fund determines the government's 
ability to give protection. Furthermore, the system of macro 
regulation and control over grain must have the right to 
participate in the international grain trade. With such a 
right, when the country has bumper harvests for several 
consecutive years, the reserve system can resort to export as a 
form of regulation in order to solve the difficulties in 
purchasing and storing grain, and vice versa. An understanding 
of the international market can be seen as a necessary condition 
which must be acquired by an open macroregulation and control 
system. 
  A system of targeted subsidies should also be considered 
while we are building a new system. Under the system of state 
monopoly for the purchase and sale of grain, what our country 
has implemented is a policy of subsidizing the whole people. At 
present, within the wages of each and every urban worker there 
is nearly 20 yuan in food subsidies. When the income gap among 
urban residents widens, there will be no need for the government 
to continue subsidizing the portion of population which earns a 
lot of money; it should, however, concentrate its financial 
strength on subsidizing the low-income population. Experts 
maintain that effective procedures to implement this idea should 
be formulated, such as opening some state grain shops selling 
ordinary government-subsidized food at low prices, to ensure 
that "people are fed but not with quality food." 
<H5>  Separation of Government and Enterprises </H5>
  After the lifting of the restrictions on the market, another 
urgent reform is to change operational mechanisms within 
state-owned grain enterprises and establish a new system in 
which a policy-based grain regulation and control system 
coexists with an enterprise-like grain operation system. 
  At present, state-owned grain enterprises have their own 
economic interests, but at the same time they perform a 
regulatory function of a policy nature. The consequence is 
that, during actual practice, it is easy to have contradictions 
between enterprise behavior and government behavior, to the 
extent that government regulation and control cannot be really 
implemented, or even that market contradictions are intensified. 
This point has become very clear during the several rounds of 
fluctuations in the grain market over the past 15 years of 
reform. Therefore, economists maintain that the crucial link in 
the new system is to solve the problem of mingling government 
and enterprises in state-owned grain departments, that is, to 
separate grain of a policy nature from grain of an operational 
nature, so that at the same time when state-owned grain 
enterprises truly walk toward the market, the government 
acquires a means of macro regulation and control which can 
discharge government functions and duties independently. 
  After the lifting of restrictions on the market, another big 
thing the government must do is to establish a number of 
regional grain wholesale markets and a series of corresponding 
market regulations to enable the flow of grain to have a channel 
through which the state can conveniently exercise control. 
  At present, our country has already established a large 
number of grain wholesale markets, as well as several futures 
markets. But a market order has not been formed, and there are 
enthusiastic transactions outside the market and unenthusiastic 
transactions within the market. According to experts, the state 
should stipulate that interprovincial grain regulation should be 
traded in the large-scale wholesale markets established by the 
state. Only in this way can we form a new pattern in which the 
state regulates and controls the market, the market guides 
enterprises in operation as well as guiding the flow of grain of 
producers. 
  A special policy must be adopted for a special commodity and 
a special market. This is an enlightenment with profound 
contents which has been left to the people by this round of 
grain price fluctuations.

<F P=106> [Dispatch from Fuzhou by correspondent Pan Didu (3382 1593 </F>
6757): "Fujian Township and Town Enterprises Enjoy Increases in 
Growth Rate and Efficiency"] 
  [Text] The total output value of Fujian township and town 
enterprises in 1993 for the first time has exceeded 100 billion 
yuan and has made Fujian one of the nation's 100 billion yuan 
provinces. 
  Encouraged by the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's southern 
inspection tour addresses, Fujian township and town enterprises 
further emancipated their minds, unified understanding, and 
increased reform efforts and the pace of development. In 1993, 
they achieved a total output value of 101.3 billion yuan; the 
total value of delivered exports was 19 billion yuan; and total 
profits and taxes reached 8 billion yuan; up 85 percent, 75 
percent, and 45 percent respectively from the year before and 
indicating simultaneous increases in the growth rate and 
efficiency. 
  The characteristics of the rapid growth of Fujian's township 
and town enterprises are: 
  --Increasing inputs and the continued expansion of the 
development scale. Last year, the province's township and town 
enterprises injected 15 billion yuan -- more than double the 
amount in the previous year -- and there were 61,800 new firms 
and 94 business conglomerates which developed some strong 
industries and widely marketed products. 
  --The rapid growth of joint stock enterprises. An operating 
mechanism is adopted in which financing, benefits, accumulation, 
and risks are all shared. A joint stock cooperation system was 
vigorously promoted in rural areas, through which a total of 10 
billion yuan was raised from across the province. Nineteen 
thousand enterprises participated in the rural joint stock 
cooperation system, giving new vitality to township and town 
enterprises and their rapid development. 
  --Active nongovernment-run scientific research activity and 
notable scientific and technological progress. Township and 
town enterprises throughout the province last year invested 2.3 
billion yuan, launched 2,799 key technological transformation 
projects, developed 23 new provincial- and prefectural-level 
products, popularized approximately 400 new scientific and 
technological products, and established 135 nongovernmental 
scientific and technological organizations, greatly speeding up 
the progress of township and town enterprises toward high and 
new technologies. 
  --Mushrooming small industrial zones and continued expansion 
in operating scale. Across the province, there are now 725 
small industrial zones with a certain scale. Ten townships and 
towns saw their output value top 1 billion yuan, while 69 
villages and 40 enterprises saw their output value top 100 
million yuan. 
  --Opening up on all fronts and breakthroughs in establishing 
domestic lateral ties and in introducing foreign investment. 
Last year, the province approved approximately 1,800 new 
foreign-invested enterprises commanding $1.8 billion in foreign 
capital, approximately 800 million of which -- about 40 percent 
of the new investment by all township and town enterprises in 
the same year -- has been committed. Thirty-one enterprises 
located outside the province were established, and approximately 
1,950 new domestic lateral projects were launched, which brought 
with them 3.9 billion yuan in domestic funds.

  [Text] Shanghai, February 15 (CNS)--Statistics released by 
the Shanghai Bureau of Statistics indicate that the gross 
national product (GNP) realized in 1993 in Shanghai was 150.993 
billion renminbi, 14.9 percent up over the year before when 
calculated on constant prices. 
  The statistics show that industry, which is considered the 
most important pillar for the economy of the municipality, 
proceeded at a quick pace last year by following the market 
demand. The gross industrial sales value was 323.74 billion 
renminbi for the whole of last year, a gain of 20.1 percent over 
the previous year. The sales rate for industrial products 
reached 98.9 percent. Following structural adjustment, backbone 
industries including automobiles, communications, equipment for 
power stations, computers, and household appliances saw rapid 
development in Shanghai. 
  Tertiary industry, including transportation, posts and 
telecommunications, commerce, the catering business, the supply 
and marketing of materials and financial as well as insurance 
business tended to go further. The added value in this sector 
was 57.207 billion renminbi for the whole year, a rise of 13.2 
percent over the year before. This added value in tertiary 
industry made up 37.9 percent of the GNP. 
  The municipality saw massive construction of infrastructural 
facilities in the urban area last year when improvements to 
urban road traffic facilities were given priority. Year-round 
spending on roads, electricity, gas, supply and drainage of 
water, and posts and telecommunications services was 16.419 
billion renminbi, an increase of 94.7 percent over the previous 
year. A number of major urban facilities including the Yangpu 
Bridge were completed last year. The statistics, however, reveal 
that traffic congestion across the municipality remained 
serious. The total traffic volume handled by the public 
transportation system reached 5.6 billion person/times, an 
average daily volume of 15.34 million person/times. 
  The rate of growth of population in Shanghai maintained a 
negative trend while the natural growth registered a gain of 
negative 0.8 per 1,000, the second year in succession to witness 
a negative growth in population in the municipality, not yet 
seen in other provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. 
The statistics also said that the annual wage for a worker in 
Shanghai was 5,600 renminbi on average in 1993, posting a gain 
of 9.1 percent when taking into consideration the price rise in 
living expenses.

(1728 1031 1869): "The Total Output Value of Guangdong's Rural 
Enterprises Exceeds 200 Billion Yuan"] 
  [Text] The latest statistics show that, after two years of 
rapid development, last year Guangdong's township and town 
enterprises saw their total output value and total income 
increase by 100 percent over the figures from two years earlier. 
Both indices surpassed 200 billion yuan; of the 220 billion 
yuan of total income, the net increase was 72.4 billion yuan 
over the previous year. Last year, Guangdong's township and 
town enterprises earned a net profit of 16 billion yuan, turned 
over 6.7 billion yuan in taxes, and earned $7.5 billion through 
exports. These three economic indicators rose by more 40 
percent compared to those of the previous year. 
  Enhancing competitiveness by having an appropriate 
operational scale, developing high and new technologies and 
opening up new markets, and making efforts to earn foreign 
currency by utilizing Guangdong's advantage as the native land 
of overseas Chinese were the three main reasons why Guangdong's 
township and town enterprises could make break-through 
developments last year, and they were also a major embodiment of 
the greatly increased overall economic strength. In the process 
of developing township and town enterprises, governments at all 
levels in Guangdong have paid good attention to maintaining an 
appropriate scale of operation, have optimized the organization 
of the finished projects in many respects, and have promoted the 
rational flow and recombination of personnel, capital, 
technology, resources, and other means of production so as to 
obtain returns through an economy of scale. For new projects, 
they have adopted various means of management such as stepping 
them up, slowing them down, or stopping them, to ensure the 
development of key projects, infrastructure, and projects that 
meet market needs. 
  During the period of macroscopic regulation and control last 
year, Zhongshan and Sanshui cities stopped or slowed down the 
development of 100 projects, thus reducing an investment of 
approximately 2.2 billion yuan and ensuring the development of 
some key projects there. In order to improve the market 
competitiveness of township and town enterprises and 
continuously open up new markets, they can only rely on 
technology-intensive quality products. It has been learned 
that, of the new projects started by townships, towns, and 
villages throughout the province last year, a fairly large 
number were high-technology projects. Once these 
technologically advanced projects have been put into operation, 
it not only will greatly enhance the economic strength of these 
places but will bring along the development of related 
industries. 
  At present, Guangdong has over 130 township and town 
enterprises whose output value has reached 100 million yuan 
each, representing a 1.4-fold increase over last year; Foshan 
city alone has 80 of these enterprises. These township and town 
enterprises which have strong capital support, which are 
technologically advanced, and whose products sell well have 
become a powerful and important force in Guangdong's economy.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 14 (CNS) -- Last year saw an 
abundant supply of goods in Guangdong's markets with the value 
of retail sales reaching RMB [renminbi] 140.26 billion, an 
increase of 34.4 percent over the year before and an actual 
increase of 13.3 percent taking inflation into consideration, 
making it the second biggest increase since 1988 from the time 
reform and opening to the outside world started. 
  Of 34 main goods, 24 of them increased in terms of sales 
volume. Increasing by more than 30 percent were colour TVs, 
air-conditioners, tape-recorders, refrigerators, garments, 
cloth, woolen goods, silk, satin and fresh eggs. 
  There was also an increase in people's level of consumption 
with purchases of well-known brand-name goods being markedly 
greater. People showed a preference for those domestically 
produced ultra-modern electrical goods of better quality and 
imported well-known brand-name goods, despite their being more 
expensive. An increase in sales was also seen in clothes, 
shoes, bedding and foodstuff.

  [Editorial Report] On 3 February, Hong Kong Bureau 
monitored the "Today's Hotline" program, a daily listener 
call-in show carried on Guangzhou Guangdong People's Radio 
Network in Mandarin scheduled from 1035 to 1200 GMT. The 
program ended at 1130 GMT on this particular day because of a 
special program series, "Talks on the New Taxation System," 
which was broadcast from 3 to 6 February. Reception ranged from 
poor to unmonitorable. 
  The following is a summary of the program: 
  1. "Today's Hotline" commenced when the program presenter, 
Wen Tao, gave a brief introduction to today's topic: 
Management-labor relations within foreign-funded, township and 
town, private, and other nongovernment-run enterprises. Wen Tao 
cited a report carried in the 18 January issue of LAODONG BAO 
[LABOR NEWS], on the resignations of more than 200 employees 
from the Shanghai Hongxiang Department Store, a Shanghai-Hong 
Kong joint venture inaugurated only four months ago, over a 
period of 40 days. The collective resignation, Wen Tao said, 
was due to poor management-labor relations, and staff members 
complained that the Hong Kong management personnel had 
arbitrarily searched their lockers, disregarding their personal 
dignity. In one case, security guards in the department store 
illegally detained and publicly beat a young saleswoman from 
Anhui Province whom they suspected to have stolen some goods. 
She was detained, interrogated for 24 hours, and later fired. 
At about 600-700 yuan a month, the salaries of the department 
store staff are not high, the presenter said. He then invited 
listeners to call in to express their opinions on this social 
phenomenon. 
  2. A Mr. Yang called in to point out that employers and 
employees are equal, therefore management should not search 
employees' lockers. According to the law, only public security 
authorities have the right to do so. Illegally searching 
employees' lockers constituted a violation of the employees' 
human dignity. He stressed that a corporation can be run well 
only if employee enthusiasm is aroused. 
  Wen Tao agreed with what Yang had said and said: Some bosses 
are good at arousing workers' enthusiasm with moderate measures, 
but others only attach importance to efficiency. They take 
ironhanded measures to deal with their workers, and put pressure 
on them. They fail to respect social ethics, human dignity, and 
self-respect. 
  3. A pop song was broadcast during a short break at 1047 
GMT. 
  4. Another listener called in to express his appreciation of 
overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan investors. He 
said: On the one hand, they want to make money in China. On the 
other hand, they also want to contribute to the mainland's 
economic development. Under whatever circumstances, employers 
and employees have common interests although there may be 
conflicts between them. Laws and regulations have been set up in 
our country to protect foreign capital, employers, and laborers. 
They should be strictly enforced. He urged foreign investors 
to take the initiative in observing China's laws concerning 
laborers' rights. 
  5. Newscast at 1100 GMT. 
  6. Commercial break. 
  7. At 1110 GMT "Today's Hotline" continued, but with poor 
reception. A Mr. Chen called in to invite the labor department 
and trade union's intervention in this sort of case. Despite 
reform and opening up, trade unions must still play their role. 
Labor departments and trade unions must send cadres to give 
workers lectures on laws, decrees, and regulations protecting 
their rights, so that they understand their rights. 
  9. Short commercial break. 
  10. Another listener pointed out that the department store 
management's search of its employees' lockers was 
"inappropriate" and "illegal." It seemed that the boss had 
violated employees' human rights, he said, adding that workers 
and staff members are protected by laws in our country. 
  11. Another listener called in to support the employees. He 
also complained about insufficient and imperfect laws and 
regulations in China on protecting workers' rights, which was 
why foreign-funded enterprises could use this loophole. He 
stressed that workers' rights and interests must be clearly 
stated in contracts. 
  12. A call from a Mr. Wu reminded the employees of the 
function of laws as a means of struggle against the employer. 
  13. Another listener stressed that the problem could be 
solved through peaceful consultation between bosses and trade 
unions. At the same time, he said, he also felt puzzled at the 
lack of impulse to stage a strike. Workers should be allowed to 
resort to a strike, he added. 
  At this point in the program, shortly before 1130 GMT, the 
presenter cut off the caller and announced that this was the end 
of the discussion. He also emphasized that views aired by 
callers were their own personal opinions and did not represent 
the stance of Guangdong People's Radio Network. 
  14. The special program series, "Talks on the New Taxation 
System," began at 1130 GMT after a short news roundup. Tao 
Fengtan, deputy director of the provincial taxation bureau, was 
invited to open the program and give the first talk on the 
reform of the taxation system. 
  He said: At present, the reform of the taxation system is a 
hot topic for discussion. Our former taxation system had been 
improved since reform and opening up, but it still could not 
satisfy the demand of economic development in various fields. 
There was much room for improvement -- for instance, there were 
many defects in the old value-added tax -- and it was necessary 
to reform the old taxation system. A new policy has been 
formulated for reforming the old system. The nucleus of the 
taxation reform system is to establish a standardized 
value-added tax. The new value-added tax is extended to the 
fields of industrial production, commodity circulation, imports, 
processing industry, repair and spare parts business, and so on. 
  Tao added: The new income tax will standardize income tax 
rates and ensure the fair competition of various quarters under 
the socialist market economy. It will also ensure that various 
economic sectors start from the same starting line to 
participate in fair competition. In addition, we have created a 
new land value-added tax. The purpose in doing so is to further 
standardize transactions of the land and real estate market, 
rationally adjust the incomes from value-added land, and protect 
the rights and interests of the state. 
  Tao stressed: The new taxation system will not increase the 
burdens of enterprises as a whole, or affect prices of goods. 
However, the taxes levied on certain products or enterprises may 
possibly change, and I hope our community will understand this. 
  Tao also explained the reasons for recent price fluctuations 
and other issues.

  [Text] Our reporter learned from the relevant department 
that last year the province's total investment in fixed assets 
amounted to 16.938 billion yuan, an increase of almost 100 
percent over the previous year. The increase in investment in 
houses of commercial value declined compared with the previous 
year. But its investment in infrastructural construction 
including energy, transportation, and telecommunications 
increased by a wide margin over the previous year. Last year 
the province's total investment in transportation, energy, 
telecommunications, urban roads, water and power supply, and 
other basic facilities amounted to 8.959 billion yuan, an 
increase of more than 100 percent over the previous year. 
  To speed up basic facilities construction, Hainan has 
introduced a preferential policy to encourage people in all 
social circles to invest in key construction projects, thus 
expediting energy, traffic, and telecommunications construction. 
  The completion of a number of infrastructural projects last 
year greatly improved the province's investment environment. 
[words indistinct] Newly built expressways totaled 129 km, 
newly formed port handling capacity totaled 800,000 metric tons, 
4,320 long-distance electric transmission lines were installed, 
105,000 gates of program control telephone exchange equipment 
were installed, and the popularization of telephone sets in the 
province outstripped the country's average. Telephone 
subscription rate in Haikou was 16.6 percent in the previous 
year and rose to 27 percent last year, ranking first among 
provincial capital cities throughout the country.

"Analyze the Economic Situation and Explore Ways for Development 
-- Regional Planning Meeting Ends, Relevant Leaders Speak at the 
Meeting, Urging All Concerned To Liberate the Mind, Deepen 
Reform, and Open Wider to the Outside World To Expedite Tibet's 
Economic Progress"] 
  [Text] A four-day regional planning meeting ended on 23 
January. Yang Song [2799 2646], vice chairman of the Tibet 
Autonomous Regional People's Government, attended and spoke at 
the meeting. Characteristics of this year's regional planning 
meeting are that the meeting touched on both the intangibles and 
tangibles. It was different from previous meetings both in form 
and content. When holding the meeting, we changed our normal 
practice that stressed investment allocation, project 
formulation, and continued fulfillment of incomplete targets. 
Instead, we concentrated our energies to analyze Tibet's 
current economic situation and to predict changes in various 
factors that will affect Tibet's future economic progress. We 
also studied ways and means to resolve problems in accordance 
with the tasks and objectives laid down by the regional economic 
work meeting. 
  Attending the meeting were more than 170 people, including 
commissioners and mayors from various prefectures and cities; 
chairmen of planning and economic commissions; directors of 
commodity price and labor bureaus; and responsible comrades of 
Tibet's various commissions, offices, departments, and bureaus. 
  Wu Shunxiang [0702 7311 4382] and Ciren Doje [2945 0088 1122 
0679], vice chairmen of the regional planning and economic 
commission, respectively relayed the guidelines of the national 
planning meeting and the national economic and trade meeting. 
Sun Qiwen [1327 1477 2429], chairman of the planning and 
economic commission, delivered a report entitled "Further 
Liberate the Mind, Deepen Reform, and Open Wider to the Outside 
World So As To Strive To Facilitate Sustained, Rapid, and 
Healthy National Economic Development." He made arrangements to 
implement the tasks laid down by the regional economic work 
meeting. Meanwhile, he also proposed to further transform the 
functions of planned administration so that planning tasks can 
more effectively fulfill the requirements resulting from changes 
in the new situation in an effort to enhance the establishment 
of a new market economy. Additionally, attending comrades 
discussed concepts and issues concerning Tibet's long-term 
development programs by the year 2010. At the end of the 
meeting, Xiang Yang [0686 2799], secretary of the regional 
planning and economic commission party committee, gave a speech 
entitled "Liberate the Mind and Change Concepts So As To Make 
Fresh Contributions to Tibet's Reform and Progress." 
  The meeting pointed out: In accordance with the basic 
requirements for establishing a socialist market economy, the 
party Central Committee, the State Council, and Tibet have 
formulated a series of important general and specific policies 
and reform measures, and we are shouldering the important 
historic mission of implementing them. While carrying out 
reform and opening up, how to link up with other localities of 
China and gear Tibet's economy toward the market are important 
issues facing us as Tibet's economy is very backward. The 
regional economic work meeting proposed that we should make new 
progress and breakthroughs in enhancing Tibet's economic 
development, in raising the per capita income of peasants and 
herdsmen, and in building more markets. We should also make 
major progress in village and town enterprises. All these tasks 
are arduous. 
  We are facing the formidable reality that the work is new 
with tough requirements and that the mission is demanding and 
difficult. Xiang Yang, secretary of the regional planning and 
economic commission party committee, proposed that our most 
important task is to study. First, we should study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinsee 
characteristics. We should also study the guidelines of the 
14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee. Moreover, we should integrate our 
thinking and understanding with the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, and the Fifth (Enlarged) Plenary Session of 
the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional Party Committee. 
Additionally, we should adhere to the party's basic line, 
strictly concentrate our efforts on the central task of economic 
construction, strive to develop the socialist market economy, 
and further pursue Tibet's policy of reform and opening up. 
Second, we should further study and properly implement various 
general and specific policies that have been newly formulated by 
the state and Tibet so that these policies can effectively 
enhance Tibet's reform and progress. Third, we should intensify 
our study of professional knowledge, which offers many topics. 
We should study matters that we do not understand. If we are 
in the dark, we should not guide others; otherwise, we cannot 
handle our work competently. To further cultivate the 
contingent of cadres and raise their professional skills, the 
Regional Cadre Training Center plans to hold different study and 
research classes on various vocations in 1994, and to engage 
some experts and comrades with practical experiences from Tibet 
and other localities to lecture in the classes so that our 
professional skills can be considerably raised. These efforts 
aim to fulfill the requirements for carrying out reform and 
opening up and for establishing a new economic system in Tibet.

  [Text] Today, the second session of the 10-day study and 
discussion session for city and autonomous prefectural party 
committee secretaries and leading cadres of provincial organs to 
study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
opened, following the end of the first session. 
  Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, presided over the report meeting. Members of the 
theoretical study central group of the provincial party 
committee and responsible comrade of provincial organs attended 
the report meeting. He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial 
party committee, delivered a speech on studying the concept of 
development of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and on upgrading the leadership work concerning 
the construction of a developed border province near the sea to 
a first-rate level. 
  Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: In essence, Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as 
the Marxism of the contemporary China, is the theory of 
development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In 
studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping or even all the works of Comrade Xiaoping, we 
should pay close attention to the issue of development and 
regard it as a basic task to study and uphold the concept of 
development of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Judging from the current practice, this has 
very important and urgent immediate significance on studying and 
upholding the concept of developing the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. With the deepening of 
reform and acceleration of development, the inherent 
contradictions in development, especially the problems in 
coordination between the three major factors of economy, 
politics, and culture, have become more and more conspicuous in 
front of leading persons at all levels. Only when we master the 
scientific concept of development, can we become qualified and 
capable of leading development, can we easily resolve the 
numerous contradictions in development, and can we ensure that 
development continues smoothly along the right track. 
  He Zhukang said: The purpose for us to study and uphold the 
concept of developing the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics is to enhance our understanding and to 
improve our ability for organization, for coping with changes, 
and for implementing policies in our effort to lead reform and 
development in line with the reality in leadership work so that 
our socialist cause can develop in a faster and better manner. 
  Based on the reality in the endeavor of building a developed 
border province near the sea, He Zhukang gave four profound 
expositions on the theory and practice of accelerating 
development. 
  First -- to understand development as a socialist historical 
task in order to enhance the sense of leadership toward 
accelerating development. He Zhukang said: In the final 
analysis, leadership work is designed to take the lead in 
development. Whether we can firmly embrace the concept of 
accelerating development is a key factor determining whether 
leadership activities are correct and whether work is effective. 
The most important point in the concept of development in 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics is to emphasize the important 
significance in development and regard development as the 
essential criterion for guiding all our work. In studying and 
upholding the concept of developing the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should, above all, 
achieve a good command of this essential criterion, continuously 
enhance our sense of strategy toward the leadership over 
development, and strive to study and promote development with 
utmost efforts. In the process of building a developed border 
province near the sea, we should firmly grasp development, the 
lifeline determining the future of China's socialism, attach 
importance to the development of our own province, cities, and 
counties from the perspective of the overall situation, include 
localities under our own leadership in the systems engineering 
project for the overall development with a strong sense of 
historical responsibility and mission, strengthen and improve 
leadership over development, and attain our respective 
development targets so as to contribute to overall development. 
  Second -- with the guidance of the concept of development 
of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, to establish and form new ideas and mechanisms 
for development. He Zhukang pointed out: Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has not only clearly 
pointed out the strategic position and strategic significance of 
the issue of development, but it has also provided systematic 
answers to the several questions concerning the theory and 
practice of development under the conditions of contemporary 
China, thus forming a fairly complete development concept in the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This 
concept of development is a scientific summary of experiences in 
China's socialist construction, especially the experiences in 
development achieved since reform and opening up started. It 
profoundly promulgates basic changes in the pattern of 
development in socialism and indicates an orientation for us to 
establish new ideas and mechanisms for development. With the 
guidance of this Marxist and scientific concept of development, 
we should make the pattern of development compatible with the 
transformation from the planned economy into the market economy 
and change the reliance on the arrangements by higher levels 
into pursuit of development geared to market demand. In 
accordance with new situations in agriculture, rural areas, and 
peasants under a market economy, we should shift the focus of 
rural work to increasing the income of peasants; meeting the 
challenges presented by the new scientific and technological 
revolution and enterprise revolution, change the structure of 
the essential elements of production from one dominated by 
natural resources into one dominated by science and technology; 
suiting the needs for continuously raising the level in 
systematic and overall economic and social development, we 
should change unbalanced development of just one sector into 
coordinated development of all sectors; and in accordance with 
the new tendency to institutionalize economic and social 
development, we should put development on a legal footing. 
  Third is to resolve the conspicuous contradictions in 
economic development and channel the implementation of the 
strategic target of building a developed border province near 
the sea onto a track characterized by high speed and high 
efficiency. He Zhukang said: The new ideas for development have 
set new and still higher demands on the leadership work of party 
committees and governments at all levels. On the one hand, we 
should accelerate reform and cultivate new mechanisms for 
development and, on the other, lose no time in strengthening 
leadership over development. At present, we should make earnest 
efforts to do practical work, achieve success in implementing 
the strategic target in a creative manner, deepen reform, 
strengthen management, create momentum for development, adjust 
the structure, better organize industries, further improve the 
distribution of resources, step up efforts to standardize and 
supervise economic activities, and protect development with 
effective measures. 
  Fourth is to have the ability to observe and handle issues 
from a political viewpoint and firmly hold the initiative in 
leading development. He Zhukang said: To better unify the 
thinking and action of the vast number of party members, cadres, 
and ordinary people in line with Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and its concept 
of development and with the grand practice in building a 
developed border province near the sea and to promote Jilin's 
development in a down-to-earth manner, we should also have the 
ability to observe and handle the issues on development from a 
political viewpoint, comprehensively consider the numerous 
political, economic, and social issues from the political angle 
of view, and note their relations. We should correctly analyze 
and handle the contradiction among the people in the new 
historical period, trust and rely on the masses, and fully boost 
their enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity. In particular, we 
should solve the problems for the workers of enterprises who 
have suspended production and of rural areas who are having a 
difficult time. We should strengthen army-government unity, 
army-civilian unity, and national unity. We should educate the 
masses with patriotism, collectivism, and socialist ideas and 
enhance the unity of party organizations. During the Spring 
Festival period, leaders at all levels should go deep into the 
grass-roots level to visit the poor and people who are having 
difficulty making ends meet. 
  In conclusion, Comrade He Zhukang said: Promoting reform, 
opening up, and the socialist modernization drive is a sacred 
mission entrusted to us by our era, our nation, and our people. 
With the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the correct 
leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the core, let us unite as one to brave the way forward, 
pioneer new causes through hard work, work in a down-to-earth 
manner, accelerate development, and strive to fulfill the grand 
target of building a developed border province near the sea. 
  After the report meeting, the provincial party committee 
held 
at its party school a forum of the city and autonomous 
prefectural party committee secretaries who had attended the 
study and discussion session. Comrade He Zhukang chaired the 
forum, and Comrades Zhang Dejiang, Wang Jinshan, Liu Xilin, and 
Feng Ximing attended. Comrade Wang Jinshan gave a report on the 
guidelines of the recent standing committee meeting of the 
provincial party committee. The participants discussed their 
experiences in the study and discussed and offered ways to 
succeed in the current work.

<F P=106> [By Xin Lijuan (6580 7787 1227): "Provincial Party Committee </F>
Holds Rally To Mark Centennial of Birth of Comrade Mao Zedong"] 
  [Text] The 100th birthday of the great man created a warm 
current that kept out the cold in the hearts of the people of 
various nationalities throughout the country. On the afternoon 
of 24 December, a huge color picture of Mao Zedong, the great 
man the people are familiar with and respect, was hung at the 
center of the rostrum of the fully seated auditorium of the 
provincial cultural activity center. A streamer with glistening 
characters reading "1893 to 1993" flanked by resplendent red 
flags, dark green pine and cypress trees, and fully blooming 
flowers were placed up front. The "rally to mark the centennial 
of the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong" held by the Jilin provincial 
party committee started amid the magnificent playing of the 
"national anthem." 
  Gao Yan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee 
and governor of the province, presided over the rally, and 
Comrade He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
gave an important speech. 
  Over 1,600 people attended the rally. They were leading 
comrades of the provincial party committee, people's congress, 
government, committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, and military district; former 
provincial-level comrades; leading comrades of the provincial 
court and procuratorate; leading comrades of army units 
stationed in Changchun and the provincial people's armed police 
force; chairmen of the provincial committees of the various 
democratic parties and the federation of industry and commerce; 
responsible comrades of various provincial departments and 
retired departmental-level comrades; responsible comrades of the 
large enterprises, scientific research units, and colleges and 
universities in Changchun; representatives of veterans of the 
Red Army, veteran party members, labor models, workers, 
peasants, intellectuals, Liberation Army, minority 
nationalities, Taiwan compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao 
compatriots, overseas Chinese, people from religious circles; 
and some cadres of some provincial organs. 
  He Zhukang pointed out in his speech: We gather here today 
with feelings of respect, to ceremoniously commemorate the 
centennial of the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong, a great Marxist, 
proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theorist, and the 
primary founder and leader of the CPC, the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army, and PRC. 
  Mao Zedong, a great man of history who later had a 
tremendous 
influence on China and the world in this century, was born in 
Shaoshanchong in Xiangtan County of China's Hunan Province on 26 
December, 100 years ago. When Mao Zedong stepped up onto 
China's political stage and became the CPC leader, he and his 
comrades-in-arms accomplished the great cause that fundamentally 
changed China's history and destiny, so that his name will 
always be remembered and respected by the Chinese people. 
Integrating the universal truth of Marxism with the specific 
practice of China's revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong created the 
Marxism of China--Mao Zedong Thought. The crystallization of 
the collective wisdom of the CPC, Mao Zedong Thought is 
extremely rich in content, including the idea on persistently 
seeking truth from facts, integrating the fundamental tenets of 
Marxism with the specific practice of China, and blazing China's 
own road of revolution and construction; the idea on People's 
Army and people's war; the idea that the CPC is the leadership 
core of Chinese people and that only socialism can save China; 
the idea of building and consolidating a republic under the 
leadership of the communist party that exercises people's 
democratic dictatorship; the idea on correctly handling the 
contradiction among the people, mobilizing all positive factors, 
uniting all the forces that can be united, and building a great 
and strong socialist country; the idea on establishing and 
developing the patriotic united front; the idea on independence, 
self-reliance, plain living, hard work, constantly striving to 
become stronger, and standing in the world; the idea on people 
being the motivation to create history, persistently uniting and 
relying on the masses, and serving the people wholeheartedly; 
the idea on maintaining and carrying forward the fine work 
styles of integrating theory with practice, maintaining close 
ties with the masses, and self-criticism; and the idea on 
comprehensively strengthening party building. Seeking truth 
from facts, the mass line, and independence are the living soul 
dominating Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the 
precious spiritual wealth of our party and the great banner 
guiding our advance. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong made immortal contributions to the 
country, the nation, and the people during his lifetime. Two of 
these were most prominent. One was that he discovered the road 
to the victory of the Chinese revolution during the period of 
the new democratic revolution; and the other was that he led 
Chinese people in establishing the socialist system and 
conducted great exploration on building socialism. Comrade Mao 
Zedong accomplished two great undertakings that changed China 
and influenced the world. His great contributions have been 
acknowledged by the world and become indelible. His meritorious 
service is indelibly engraved in history, and his thought is 
deeply rooted throughout China's vast lands. 
  Communists in contemporary China are the successors to 
carrying out Mao Zedong's cause. Carrying out the cause 
pioneered by Comrade Mao Zedong and upholding and developing Mao 
Zedong Thought are the historical responsibility of communists 
in contemporary China. As the chief architect of China's 
reform, opening up, and modernization drive, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, after acquiring a profound understanding of Marxism, 
achieving accurate mastery of the national situation of the 
contemporary China, making a thorough analysis of the changes in 
the world situation and continuously summarizing the fresh 
experiences in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, 
gradually created and established the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and brought Marxism to a 
new realm and new height in contemporary China. This theory 
provides, for the first time in the history of the international 
communist movement and the history of the development of 
Marxism, a fairly systematic and initial answer to the important 
historical task of how economically and culturally backward 
countries should build, consolidate, and develop socialism. 
This is a new and tremendous theoretical contribution made by 
Chinese communists to the international communist movement and 
is the vivid manifestation of the youthful vigor of Marxism on 
China's vast land. As has been proven in history, in the period 
of democratic revolution, Chinese revolution would not have 
succeeded without Mao Zedong Thought. Likewise, in the period of 
socialist construction, China's reform, opening up, and 
socialist modernization drive will not succeed without Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  Comrade He Zhukang emphasized: In commemorating Comrade Mao 
Zedong, our most fundamental task is to uphold and develop Mao 
Zedong Thought, arm our minds and guide all our work with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, and continue to promote reform, opening 
up, and the socialist modernization drive. 
  The purpose behind our commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong 
is 
to always adhere to the party's ideological line of emancipating 
the mind and seeking truth from facts. Emancipating the mind 
and seeking truth from facts constitutes the quintessence of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the ideological line the entire 
party should uphold at all times. As we are pioneering a 
brand-new undertaking, new conditions, new problems, and new 
contradictions will emerge in an endless stream, and 
opportunities will coexist with challenges, and hopes with 
difficulties. At this moment, we should all the more adhere to 
the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth 
from facts because it is key to the smooth progress of reform. 
To further emancipate the mind, we should continue to shake off 
the fetters imposed by the traditional pattern of the planned 
economy, truly understand reform as a profound revolution, and 
channel people's ideas onto a track compatible with the 
socialist market economy system. Emancipation of the mind 
should be reflected not only in a change of concepts but also in 
the courage to innovate and pioneer the way forward in the 
practice of reform. 
  In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should clearly 
understand the essence and characteristics of socialism and take 
the initiative in firmly adhering to the party's basic line 
consisting of "one central task and two basic points." To 
uphold socialism, we should first clarify the most important 
basic theoretical questions of what socialism is and how 
socialism should be built. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: 
"The essence of socialism is to liberate and develop productive 
forces, eliminate exploitation and polarization, and ultimately 
achieve common prosperity." This incisive scientific theory 
provides the most fundamental answers to the important questions 
of what socialism is and how socialism should be built and helps 
unify the thinking of the entire party and the people across the 
country. His emphasizing that reform is to liberate and develop 
productive forces and to ultimately achieve common prosperity 
means his persisting in the unity between means and purpose; his 
emphasizing that the superiority of socialism should be 
reflected in the development of productive forces and that 
socialism is to eliminate exploitation and polarization means 
his persisting in the unity between the criterion of productive 
forces and the criterion of people's interests; and his 
emphasizing that development of productive forces should be 
promoted by upholding the four cardinal principles, deepening 
reform, and opening wider to the outside world means his 
persisting in the unity between the "one central task" and the 
"two basic points" of the party's basic line. 
  In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should devote more 
efforts to reform and opening up and establish the socialist 
market economy system more rapidly. Economic development is the 
foundation for us to solve all problems. Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
clearly pointed out: "Development is the essential criterion," 
and "development decides on the basic solutions to problems." 
The momentum for development lies in reform, and the basic way 
to accelerate development lies in accelerating reform. Reform 
has reached a crucial period, a period for resolving the 
greatest difficulty in combining package reform with 
breakthroughs in key areas. This requires that we devote 
greater efforts to accelerating reform. The "decision of the 
CPC Central Committee on the several issues concerning the 
establishment of the socialist market economy system" adopted at 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee 
systematizes and specifies the reform targets and basic 
principles of the economic system defined at the 14th party 
congress and formulates a program of action for changing the old 
system to the new and for accelerating reform. We should 
conscientiously implement the guidelines of the "decision," 
emphasize reform, extend the degree of reform, and accelerate 
development by accelerating reform. 
  In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should 
conscientiously strengthen party building and improve the 
party's combat effectiveness. Party building is a magic weapon 
to win the success in Chinese revolution and construction. 
Strengthening party building means to arm the entire party with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to raise the ideological and theoretical 
level of cadres with party membership, especially leading 
cadres; means to do a good job in improving leading bodies at 
all levels, resolutely implement the principle of democratic 
centralism, safeguard the unity and solidarity of the party, 
raise the awareness and be more steadfast in adhering to the 
party's basic line, and improve the ability to lead reform and 
develop the market economy; means to persistently build the 
material civilization and improve the socialist spiritual 
civilization and to be strong in doing both as consistently 
advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; means to correct party 
style, step up efforts in building a clean government, wage the 
anticorruption struggle, and carry it on with unremitting 
efforts; and means to do a good job in improving grass-roots 
party organizations, give full play to the leading and exemplary 
role of party members, firmly remember the purpose of serving 
the people wholeheartedly, maintain close ties with the masses, 
and better unite and lead the masses to plunge themselves into 
the great practice of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong, we should learn from 
the noble examples and characters of Comrades Mao Zedong and 
Deng Xiaoping and other revolutionaries of the older generation. 
Their revolutionary examples and characters tempered through the 
long revolutionary struggle are the valuable spiritual wealth of 
our party. We should learn from their strong sense of 
historical mission and responsibility manifested in their 
lifelong concern for the future and destiny of the country and 
the nation; learn from their sacrificing spirit manifested in 
their respect for the masses, ardent love for the people, 
concern at all times for the interests and desires of the 
broadest part of the masses, and dedication to the liberation 
and development of the nation; learn from their firm faith in 
socialism and their tremendous courage to get rid of 
difficulties when the revolution encountered detours and was at 
a low tide; learn from their foresightedness, ability to observe 
and handle issues by taking the whole situation into account, 
and scientific approach to adopt specific measures to solve 
specific problems; learn from their patriotic values manifested 
in their unyieldingness toward external pressure and firm 
defense of state sovereignty and national dignity; and learn 
from their noble character of openheartedness and their 
awareness in party spirit manifested in their unselfishness and 
adherence to principles. We should take them as good examples, 
draw strength from their noble examples and characters, perform 
our duties more successfully, and work harder to live up to the 
ardent expectations of the proletarian revolutionaries of the 
older generation. 
  The rally concluded amid the magnificent playing of the 
"national anthem." A large literary and art performance was 
held there by the propaganda department of the provincial party 
committee and the provincial culture department after the rally. 
With respect for Comrade Mao Zedong, performers of the 
provincial song and dance ensemble, the provincial national 
orchestra, the provincial Beijing Opera troupe, and the 
institute of art staged rich and colorful music, dance, and 
Beijing Opera programs.

(1728 2529 3134): "Jilin Economic Work Conference Defines 1994 
Economic Development Ideas"] 
  [Text] Deeply implement the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee and the second 
plenary session of the sixth provincial party committee, 
concentrate more energy on reform and development, speed up the 
setup of the socialist market economic system, further expand 
the scale of opening up, emphatically readjust the industrial 
structure, increase economic results, comprehensively fulfill 
all tasks for elevating the economy to a new height, and ensure 
a sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national 
economy. These are the 1994 economic work guiding principles as 
defined at the provincial economic work conference on 21 
December. 
  Present at the conference were Wang Guofa, Quan Zhezhu, and 
Wei Minxue, vice governors of the provincial government; and 
Sang Fengwen, secretary general of the provincial government. 
  Comrade Gao Yan first divided the guidelines of the national 
economic work conference into nine parts and relayed the 
guidelines. The contents of these nine parts are the current 
situation, the 1994 economic work principles and tasks, the 
vigorous development of the rural economy, the increase in the 
peasants' income, the stress on economic results, the efforts to 
realistically grasp the industrial and communications 
production, the several major reform measures as put forward in 
line with the general targets for accelerating the setup of the 
socialist market economic system, the efforts to grasp favorable 
opportunities to further expand the scale of opening up, the 
efforts to appropriately handle the relations of reform, 
development, and social stability, and the enhancement and 
improvement of the leadership over the economic work. After 
that, Comrade Liu Xilin comprehensively arranged the 1994 
economic work. 
  After analyzing the 1994 economic development trends and 
defining the national economic development targets, he first 
used conclusive figures to introduce the province's new 
achievements in reform and economic construction. He said: The 
14 managerial rights which are delegated to enterprises 
according to the "regulation" are being delegated in a 
step-by-step manner. Noticeable achievements have been made in 
experimenting with the shareholding system. The state-owned and 
civilian-run enterprises have been popularized on a large scale. 
Simultaneously, the company system is carried out on a trial 
basis. Key headway has been made in price reform, new headway 
has been made in carrying out the social insurance system and 
reforming the economic system, and new strides have been made in 
reforming the planning and investment system and the housing 
system and setting up the market system. Based on the 1992 
rapid economic growth rate, in 1993, the province continues to 
maintain the good faster development trend. The major targets 
for elevating the economy to a new height have been fulfilled. 
The GNP is expected to reach 5.5 billion yuan, an increase of 
14.3 percent over 1992. Of this, the added value of the 
tertiary industry is expected to reach 13.3 billion yuan, an 
increase of 17.3 percent; the total agricultural output value is 
expected to reach 22.4 billion yuan, the second peak year in 
history; the total output value of town and township enterprises 
is expected to reach 30 billion yuan, an increase of 40 percent 
over 1992; the total industrial output value is expected to 
reach 81 billion yuan, an increase of 18 percent; the total 
volume of retail sales of commodities is expected to reach 35.2 
billion yuan, an increase of 17.9 percent; and the foreign 
export trade volume is expected to reach $1.6 billion, an 
increase of 23 percent. A total of 1,400 foreign-funded 
enterprises of three types have been approved and $650 million 
foreign capital has really been used, an increase of more than 
200 percent over the figures of last year. The capital profit 
and tax rate reaches 6.24 percent. (If calculated according to 
comparable factors, the targets of elevating the economy to a 
new height can be fulfilled.) The per capita labor productivity 
of the independent accounting industrial enterprises at or above 
the township level reaches 9,686 yuan. The turnover of the 
working funds is 1.27 times. The energy consumption for per 
10,000 yuan of industrial output value is 3.46 tonnes of 
(standard coal.) The revenues are expected to reach 6.8 billion 
yuan, an increase of 19 percent. The bank savings deposits 
reach 48.39 billion yuan, an increase of 7.5 billion yuan over 
the figure at the beginning of the year. The per capita net 
income of the peasants reaches 864 yuan and the urban dwellers' 
income for living expenses reach 1,735.6 yuan. The investment 
in fixed assets of society reach 20 billion yuan, an increase of 
33 percent over 1992. The investment in the fixed assets of 
localities reach 14.07 billion yuan, an increase of 34.9 
percent. Of this, the investment in technological 
transformation reaches 2.8 billion yuan. 
  Liu Xilin said: The year 1994 is a year to implement the 
"decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party 
Central Committee, to wholly promote the economic structural 
reform, and to make key breakthroughs in the economic structural 
reform as well as the last year to attain the three-year target 
of elevating the economy to a new height as required by the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government. The 
1994 major national economic and social development targets are 
defined as follows: 
  The GNP should increase by 12 percent and strive to increase 
by 16.5 percent. Of this, the added value of the tertiary 
industry should increase by 20 percent and strive to reach 28 
percent. 
  The total agricultural output value should increase by 6 
percent and strive to reach 7.4 percent. The total grain output 
should reach 19 billion kilograms. The total output value of 
town and township enterprises should increase by 33.3 percent. 
  The total industrial output value should increase by 15 
percent and strive to increase 18.4 percent. 
  The capital profit and tax rate of the industrial front 
should increase by 2 percentage point. The per capita labor 
productivity of the independent accounting industrial 
enterprises at or above the township level should increase by 14 
percent. The energy consumption for per 10,000 yuan of output 
value should be reduced by 3 percent. The turnover of the 
working funds should reach 1.37 times. 
  The revenues should increase by 8 percent. 
  The bank savings deposits should increase by 8.5 billion 
yuan, an increase of 17.5 percent. 
  The volume of retail sales of commodities should increase by 
17 percent. 
  The foreign export trade volume should reach $2 billion, an 
increase of 25 percent. A total of $750 million foreign capital 
should really be used, and the use of foreign capital should 
strive to reach $800 million foreign capital. 
  The per capita net income of the peasants should reach 910 
yuan and the urbanites' income for living expenses should reach 
more than 1,800 yuan. 
  The retail price index should be controlled within 10 
percent. 
  The 1994 reform tasks are extremely arduous. Liu Xilin 
pointed out: Setting up the modern enterprise system is an 
effective way for realizing the public ownership form under the 
conditions for exploring the market economy as well as a reform 
orientation of the state-owned enterprises. According to 
different actual conditions, enterprises should adopt different 
forms to reform the property right system. First, develop the 
shareholding system. Next year, we should strive to transform 
50 to 100 state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises with 
good foundation and good economic results into limited companies 
or shareholding corporations. Second, reorganize, on a trial 
basis, state-owned, wholly funded limited companies. Next year, 
100 enterprises in the province should be changed into companies 
of this kind. In addition, we should also carry out various 
forms of property right systems, such as "state ownership and 
civilian management," grafting management, shareholding 
cooperative management, "separate management," management based 
on reformed system, amalgamation, and bankruptcy. 
Simultaneously, we should also positively reform the financial, 
investment, planning, and foreign trade systems in the 
macroeconomic spheres; positively and steadily promote the 
reform of price, housing, social insurance systems; focus on 
cultivating the markets for production factors; and vigorously 
strengthen the construction of capital, land, labor, technology, 
information, and property right markets. 
  In regard to the issues of speeding up the economic 
development and striving to fulfill the task of elevating the 
economy to a new height, Liu Xilin stressed: We should 
strengthen agriculture's role as the foundation of the national 
economy, vigorously develop the shareholding cooperative 
economy, and cultivate and expand the mainstay of the markets. 
It is necessary to ceaselessly perfect the responsibility 
system dominated by the contracted responsibility on the 
household basis with payment linked to output and the dual 
management system of linking centralized management with 
decentralized management and along with the setup of the 
socialist market economy. We should stabilize the land contract 
relations and extend the land contract periods. Under the 
conditions of persisting in the collective ownership of the land 
and not changing the purposes of utilization of land, the 
peasants are allowed to sell the land utilization rights within 
the contract periods. Barren hills and wasteland can be rent, 
mortgaged, and used in exchange for stocks. In this way, land 
resources will effectively be distributed and appropriately be 
managed. The shareholding cooperative system is created by the 
peasants in order to suit the new situation of developing the 
market economy. Therefore, all localities should run and 
transform town and township enterprises in the form of the 
shareholding cooperation system and organize and set up 
circulation organizations and socialized service organizations. 
  In regard to the industrial production, Liu Xilin set 
forth: Next year, we should carry out our work emphatically in 
line with the requirements for readjusting structures, 
transforming mechanisms, grasping management, and increasing 
efficiency. In the course of readjusting the industrial 
structure, we should further expand such two pillar industries 
as the petrochemical and vehicle industries; develop the 
industries with advantages, such as food, medicine, 
metallurgical, building materials, and paper-making industries; 
and strengthen such basic industries as energy and raw material 
industries. We should also positively develop the electronics 
industry. We should emphatically grasp the construction of a 
large number of key projects, such as the 300,000-tonne ethylene 
project of Jilin Chemical industry Company, the sedan car 
manufacturing project and its auxiliary projects of the 
Changchun No. 1 Vehicle Manufacturing Plant, and the first phase 
of the Shuangliao power plant project; and conduct technological 
transformation among the "bottle neck" and weak links that 
affect the economic development. The enterprises should 
organize structural readjustment according to the requirements 
for the market economy, further develop specialized and 
integrated management, and adopt various forms to optimize the 
reorganization of enterprises. The product mix should be 
readjusted according to the principle of supporting the 
production of the products with advantages, creating new 
products, increasing the production of readily marketable 
products, controlling the production of unmarketable products, 
and limiting the production of ordinarily marketable products. 
we should support the production of quality products in line 
with the preferential policies. Next year, we should develop 
2,400 new products and focus on developing 50 new products each 
creating 2 to 5 million yuan of profits and taxes annually. 
  Keeping a proper scale of investment in fixed assets is a 
key 
condition for economic growth. Next year, the investment in 
fixed assets should be 24 billion yuan. The total investment 
will be used for key construction projects and technological 
transformation projects. 
  We should speed up the economic development pace; vigorously 
develop the collective, private, and individual sectors of the 
economy; cultivate new national economic growth points; pay high 
attention to science and technology and education; positively 
develop the tertiary industry; organize market supply; and make 
good arrangements for the people's livelihood. 
  Further expanding the scale of opening to the outside world 
and vigorously developing the export-oriented economy is one of 
the province's economic work priorities. Liu Xilin urged: In 
the new year, we should positively expand the international 
market and vigorously develop foreign trade. We should further 
improve the export commodity structure; vigorously grasp the 
export of additional-value machinery and electronics products 
and complete sets of equipment with strong competitiveness on 
the international market, high foreign exchange earnings, and 
good export projects and new high-tech products. We should 
expand the export of labor-intensive light and textile products. 
We should accelerate the transformation of a number of 
export-oriented town and township enterprises; gradually set up 
a system where the production of grain, oil, meat, vegetable, 
fruit, and timber is comprehensively developed; and establish 
enterprise groups with foreign exchange earnings. We should 
improve the environment of opening to the outside world and 
positively and effectively use foreign capital. Next year, we 
should approve 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises and strive to 
use $800 million foreign capital. We should realistically 
achieve the construction and management of development zones, 
continue to run four state-class development zones, and strive 
to gain approvals for setting up several provincial-level 
development zones. 
  Liu Xilin urged: To suit the 1994 reform and development, 
the leading organs at various levels and the leading cadres 
should noticeably improve their leadership forms and work style. 
Next year, the provincial, city, and county government organs 
should conduct reform in succession. The reform targets are to 
change functions, balance relationship, streamline 
administration, and improve efficiency. The most urgent task 
for changing the government functions is to realize the 
transition from direct management of enterprises to 
macroeconomic regulation and control, to grasp the setup of the 
markets for production factors, and to create conditions for 
sending enterprises to markets. He hoped that the cadres at 
various levels should clearly understand the situation, have 
firm faith, overcome difficulties, vigorously promote reform and 
opening up, and fight for promoting a sustained, fast, and sound 
development of the national economy. 
  Present at the conference were principal leaders of the city 
(autonomous prefectural) governments, leaders of the 
provincial-level and city (autonomous prefectural) departments 
concerned, and plant directors (managers) of some large 
enterprises.

  [Text] Shenyang, February 11 (XINHUA) -- Giving 
decision-making powers to state-owned enterprises in northeast 
China's Liaoning Province has proved the key to modernizing the 
production facilities and improving product quality. 
  That is the view of experts in Liaoning, China's oldest 
industrial base which has made strenuous efforts since 1991 to 
renew its old facilities and enhance the quality of products. 
  Between 1991 and 1993, the province, employing 33.36 billion 
yuan, fulfilled 1,800 projects of technology enhancement. 
  At the beginning of the 1990s, only 32.5 percent of the 
installed equipment in this industrial region, formed as early 
as the 1950s, was up to satisfactory 1980s levels, lower than 
the country's average standard. 
  That resulted in the poor quality of processed products and 
final products. The output value from the mining and raw 
material sectors accounts for over 41 percent of the province's 
industrial total. 
  Focusing on 50 major products, Liaoning's improvement 
program 
has kept its eye both on domestic and overseas markets in the 
past three years. 
  In the current market economy drive, enterprises in the 
province have used flexible means to raise funds. More than 60 
percent of the total investment in the improvement project was 
self-raised. 
  In just this way, Huludao Zinc Smeltery has successfully 
renovated itself into the world's largest smeltery in the 
nonferrous metal industry. Its annual capacity is expected to 
reach 400,000 tons, while three years ago it was 100,000 tons. 
  By the end of 1993, technological progress achieved in 
Liaoning had enhanced the proportion of semi-finished products 
to final products from 8:2 to 7:3, and in exports, from 81:19 to 
66:34. 
  Medium and large-sized enterprises in the province have also 
gained competitive strength, with about 10 percent of them 
becoming well-known in markets at home and abroad.

<F P=106> [Report by the Policy Research Office of the Ningxia </F>
Regional CPC Committee: "Another Year of Major Advances in 
Rural Areas -- Commenting on Rural Developments in Our Region in 
1993"] 
  [Text] This region scored gratifying achievements in rural 
economic development in 1993 through replacing the old system 
with a new one. 
  In the field of agricultural production, the total grain 
output hit 2.03 million tonnes, breaching the 2 million-tonne 
line for the first time, up 11 percent on the previous year. 
The total output of oil-bearing crops was 63,000 tonnes, up 1.4 
percent on the previous year. The total output of 
sugar-yielding crops was 480,000 tonnes, 30,000 tonnes more than 
the previous year. The total output of aquatic products was 
15,000 tonnes, up 12.5 percent over the previous year. Both the 
cultivated area for and the output of vegetables and other cash 
crops increased by a wide margin. The numbers of butchered 
pigs, cows, and chickens climbed, and total meat production was 
greater than inthe previous year. The task of afforestation was 
overfulfilled, and there was a bumper fruit harvest. Gross 
agricultural output value stood at 3.187 billion yuan, up 6.7 
percent over the previous year in terms of comparable items. 
  Township enterprises gained a robust momentum of growth, 
with 
1993 gross output value likely to reach 2.9 billion yuan, up 36 
percent over the previous year. Individually owned and 
privately owned enterprises grew rapidly, with their workers 
accounting for 61.4 percent of the total number of workers 
employed by township enterprises, and their output value 
accounting for 50 percent of the total output value of township 
enterprises, so they have become the mainstay of this region's 
township enterprises. 
  In 1993, the peasants' per capita net income was 667.04 
yuan, 
an increase of 7.8 percent compared with the previous year. 
  The year 1993 was a difficult one for the rural economy, and 
also a year in which party committees and governments at all 
levels strengthened agriculture and made earnest efforts. To 
boost agricultural production and increase the peasants' income, 
the autonomous regional government set up a leading group for 
rural work to coordinate and strengthen the comprehensive study 
of rural work. Departments concerned at all levels 
conscientiously served agricultural production and discontinued 
unreasonable charges, with the result that the peasants' burden 
decreased by 6.2 percent acorss the region as compared with the 
previous year. Large numbers of cadres at the basic level 
energetically helped peasants explore ways to prosperity and 
solve problems arising in the course of agricultural production 
in every possible way so as to promote rural economic 
development. 
  The year 1993 was one in which the market mechanism was 
strengthened. Most agricultural products were open to market 
forces, control over the marketing of grain was entirely lifted, 
and market building was accelerated so that the economic 
vitality increased noticeably. The region made new progress in 
developing a highly efficient agriculture that provides greater 
and better yields. First, the structure of the growing industry 
was adjusted at a greater pace according to market needs, and 
the mix of crops, of varieties, and of growing techniques also 
was improved. The area sown to barley -- which is used for 
brewing beer -- and to beans increased 71 and 43 percent, 
respectively, over the previous year. The area sown to perilla 
seed, vegetables, asparagus, and artificially cultivated 
licorice root also was expanded. A total of 169,000 mu of 
one-tonne-yield-per-mu fields, as well as 22,000 mu of 
"twin-thousand [shuang qian 7175 0578] fields" were built across 
the region. The greenhouse area increased to 6,179 mu, with the 
maximum per-mu value coming to 20,000 yuan. Second, various 
stereoscopic compound growing models [li ti fu he zhong zhi mo 
shi 4539 7555 1788 0678 4429 2784 2875 1709] were spread and 
became important means of increasing production and income. The 
stereoscopic compound area sown to grain, oil-bearing crops, 
sugar-yielding crops, and vegetables -- including the area for 
interplanting wheat with corn -- was to the tune of 2.758 
million mu across the region. In the irrigated area, the 
stereoscopic compound growing area constituted 48 percent of the 
total area sown to crops. In the mountain area, peas were 
interplanted with potatoes, so that summer crops could be 
supplemented with fall crops, and vice versa, with the result 
that the per-mu output value increased by 50 to 80 percent. 
Third, to meet the market needs, many production bases for 
superior and quality crops were built up, and an integrated 
system for production, processing, and marketing was formed. A 
more dynamic market mechanism greatly adjusted peasants' 
operational behavior and fluctuations in the prices of 
agricultural products told them they must choose efficient 
products and trades. This was an important reason for the 
increase in peasants' income last year. 
  The year 1993 was one in which the rural economy and society 
developed hand in hand. Since the beginning of last year, 
another 13 central market towns have been built or reformed, and 
a total of 87 million yuan has been spent on the construction of 
market towns. The area of newly built housing in rural areas 
totaled 1.25 square meters, and the quality and functions of 
housing were greatly improved. 
  In 1994, the rural areas will face new opportunities and 
challenges. The major reform measures taken by the state with 
regard to finance, taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade, 
and state enterprises will give an enormous impetus to 
agricultural production and the rural economy, but they also 
will entail some undesirable effects, owing to the great 
adjustment in interest relationships. Therefore, we must effect 
a strategic change in our guiding principle for rural work in 
order to meet the needs of the new situation. We must make 
setting up a market economy system our goal, focus on increasing 
peasants' income, accelerate rural reforms, and adjust the setup 
of production in rural areas at a greater pace. Organizations 
at all levels must seize the opportunity, make concerted 
efforts, and continue to clear the way to forge ahead to add new 
luster to rural areas across the region.

<F P=106> [Report of interview with Zhao Leji, director of Qinghai </F>
Provincial Finance Department, by staff reporter Zuo Xiling 
(1563 6007 3781): "Our Countermeasures Under the New Tax 
System"] 
  [Text] The State Council has decided that a tax sharing 
management system is to be fully implemented throughout the 
country as of 1 January this year. This important 
transformation in the financial distribution system will 
undoubtedly bring about new changes in our province's financial 
distribution structure and produce great impact on our 
province's economic development. For this reason, this reporter 
recently interviewed Comrade Zhao Leji, our provincial finance 
department director. 
  This reporter has learned from Director Zhao's briefing 
that, 
in the long run, with the implementation of the tax sharing 
financial system, the financial capacity of the central 
authorities will be strengthened and able to regulate financial 
distribution among various localities, optimizing resource 
disposition to gradually narrow the gaps between various 
localities in terms of economic and social development. 
However, a fairly long period of time will be needed. 
According to the principle of structural reform characterized 
by separating the system from difficulties and giving priority 
to ensure the smooth promulgation of the new economic system, in 
establishing the tax sharing financial management system 
involving the central authorities and localities, no special 
consideration has been given to our province as a region of 
minority nationalities. It is obvious that we are encountering 
financial difficulties. 
  Although the tax system reform has not increased the tax 
loads of enterprises in our province as a whole, our province 
has faced greater challenge in the competition in the unified 
market of the whole country because the level of economic 
efficiency of enterprises in our province is generally low. In 
this connection, Zhao Leji maintained that our province must 
adopt the following relevant countermeasures: 
  We must be firm and unshakable in developing the economy. 
Value-added tax is our province's major source of financial 
income. According to the new tax system reform, the central 
authorities will get 75 percent of the tax. Value-added tax is 
a general tax category. As long as our economy has been 
developed, we can get 25 percent of the tax. If we add the 30 
percent rebates from the amount of tax increase to this, we can 
get about 40 percent returns. The tax income rebates which the 
central authorities give to various localities will definitely 
be linked to the growth of the value-added tax and consumption 
tax of the whole country according to a certain coefficient. It 
is obvious that, as long as we are firm and unshakable in 
promoting economic development, the central authorities can get 
more and so can we. This is the only way out for our province 
to extricate itself from its financial predicament. 
  We must regulate our ideas on development and cultivate 
local 
financial resources. With the implementation of the tax sharing 
system, the structure of our province's financial resources will 
also change. This new setup will definitely have an impact on 
the growth of our province's local financial resources and also 
play a role in guiding our province's economic development. 
Under the prerequisite of conforming with the state industrial 
policy, the focus of augmenting our province's financial 
resources should be shifted to the vigorous development of those 
trades and products which are directly connected with our local 
financial resources. We should pay attention to devoting our 
limited funds to projects and links which have obvious 
efficiency and can increase local financial incomes to expand 
Qinghai's local financial capacity. According to the new tax 
system, the resource tax on the majority of items is regarded as 
local income. Our province is rich in natural resources and we 
must fully exploit this strong point. We must promote the 
exploitation of our natural resources such as hydropower, salt 
lakes, petroleum, natural gas, metals, mineral products, and 
asbestos mines. Business tax and income tax from local 
enterprises are the main sources of local revenues. We must 
vigorously develop our tertiary industry, speed up the pace of 
reform and opening up, fully combine the importing of advanced 
technology with internal economic connections, and develop 
nongovernment-owned economic sectors, including collective, 
individual, private, and joint-stock enterprises. Our tertiary 
industry has very great potential and we have bright prospects 
for developing our financial resources. 
  We must try in every possible way to increase economic 
efficiency in our state-owned enterprises. According to the tax 
sharing system, localities will have their own due shares. The 
purpose in doing so is to encourage localities to enhance 
economic efficiency in state-owned enterprises. However, in our 
province one-third of our state-owned enterprises obviously lose 
money in business, one-third losing money latently, and only 
one-third is truly making profit. Although the tax loads of our 
state-owned enterprises have not yet become heavier as a result 
of the implementation of the tax sharing system, various systems 
have been strictly standardized, including those governing 
enterprise tax, tax reduction and exemption, repayment of 
investment loans, income distribution, and so on. The majority 
of state-owned enterprises in our province cannot adapt 
themselves to such changes. In particular, they are facing a 
big challenge in the unified markets of the whole country and in 
the great environment of fair competition. To enhance 
enterprise efficiency under the new financial system, we must, 
at least, grasp the following focal points: First, we must 
develop a sense of efficiency. The economic work focus of local 
governments is to grasp enhancement of enterprise efficiency. 
Efficiency should mainly be regarded as a yardstick for 
examining enterprise achievements. Second, we must enhance the 
efficiency of scale (gui mo xiao yi 6016 2875 2400 4135) and 
establish a base for efficiency resources to develop a structure 
of group-type financial resources (xing cheng ji tuan xing de 
cai yuan ti xi 1748 2054 7162 097 0992 4104 2088 3293 7555 4762) 
to promote development of scale, management of scale, expansion 
of scale, and enhance enterprise competitiveness in market 
competition. Third, we must establish supervisory mechanisms for 
financial resources and examine the efficiency of financial 
resources at all levels. Fourth, we must establish a modern 
enterprise system to invigorate our state-owned enterprises and 
gradually relieve the state of its unlimited responsibilities 
for enterprises. 
  We must transform government functions, speed up socialized 
management, and provide excellent services. With the 
implementation of the tax sharing system, on the basis of 
defining the control powers of the central government, it is 
necessary to further define the control powers of local 
governments. In other words, trades and projects which are 
closely connected with the development of the local social 
economy and undertakings should be independently developed by 
local governments. This can clearly show the direction for 
speeding up the changeover of local government functions. Local 
governments must firmly seize on this favorable opportunity to 
switch from directly running enterprises and commanding their 
production and business operations activities to strengthening 
social management and basic facilities projects and providing 
still better services for the operations of enterprises to 
create an environment which is more beneficial to macroscopic 
economic environment. 
  Comrade Zhao Leji also pointed out that apart from relying 
on 
ourselves to increase incomes considerably, strictly exercise 
control over expenditure, and solve some difficulties, the key 
lay in striving for the help of the central authorities, so that 
when they are establishing a system which governs the transfer 
of payment system they will fully consider Qinghai's 
difficulties and give our province the necessary support.

<F P=106> [Article by Ma Hongbo (7456 3163 3134): "Handle Well </F>
Relations Between Central Administration and Localities in 
Economic Development"] 
  [Text] Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, our reform has been progressing along the 
lines of "delegating power and yielding profits" [fang quan rang 
li 2397 2938 6245 0448]. The central administration and the 
localities have separated their management functions, and 
localities have expanded their competence in terms of finance, 
capital, investments and foreign trade. With the implementation 
of the policy enabling localities to be responsible for their 
finances, namely "dividing revenue and expenditure between the 
central administration and localities, and holding each 
responsible for balancing their budgets," the previous practice 
of "eating from the same kitchen" has been changed into "eating 
from separate kitchens." This has embodied the idea exactly. 
The expansion of localities' economic competence has aroused 
their enthusiasm for developing the economy, and has changed the 
situation in which local economic development and structural 
adjustment are completely controlled by the central mandatory 
plans and incremental investments [zeng liang tou zi 1073 6852 
2121 6327]. This has changed the passive state of localities 
having to wait for, rely on and look to the central 
administration to promote local construction. All this has 
promoted local economic development in an unprecedented fashion, 
and has set off an upsurge of construction the like of which 
never occurred in the past. 
  However, owing to the fact that when the central 
administration "delegates power and yields profits," when 
macroscopic constraint mechanisms, and a system to govern 
interest relationships has not been established, various 
localities' responsibilities do not conform with their power and 
interests. Under such circumstances, localities were prompted 
to distort price signals, and maximize their interests. They 
vied with one another to invest in high-price and huge-profit 
processing industries. They repeatedly imported items and 
carried out construction projects one after another. This 
happened everywhere. As a result, the proportion of the 
processing industry in the total output value of industrial 
production increased from 38.1 percent in 1982 to 43.9 percent 
in 1988. In recent years, although the central administration 
has strengthened its regulation and control to a certain extent, 
the changes in proportion have not yet proved ideal. 
Consequently, areas producing resources and are separated from 
processing zones, and various areas have developed the same kind 
of operational setups. The local industrial structure situation 
was tending toward the same pattern became increasingly serious. 
This triggered off local economic frictions and coincident 
market fluctuations. There occurred an "economy of feudal 
princes" [zhu hou jing ji 6175 0186 4842 3444], characterized by 
scrambling for natural resources and imposing trade blockades on 
one another. Thus the efficiency of natural resource 
disposition was greatly reduced. In addition, the central 
administration had increasingly weaker capability in 
concentrating its financial and material resources, but its 
burdens were very heavy. It was unable to invest in basic 
facilities projects, which needed huge amounts of investment and 
longer periods of time for completion. The development of basic 
industries and infrastructure projects -- including energy, raw 
and processed materials, communications and transportation, and 
so on -- lagged far behind the development of processing 
industry. This aggravated the imbalanced structure of supply 
and demand in the national economy. In particular, our railways, 
which undertake the main transport task, were heavily overloaded 
to maintain a normal transport situation. 
  It is obvious that the deep root of these chaotic phenomena 
in the sustained development of the national economy, and the 
increasingly serious conflicts among energy, raw and processed 
materials, and processing industry, in particular, lies in 
improper handling of the relations between the central 
administration and localities. So what is to be done? Should 
we return to the previous traditional system, in which the 
central administration exercised rigid control over the 
localities? Or take a laissez-faire attitude toward the present 
situation? In his "On the Ten Major Relationships," Comrade Mao 
Zedong said: To build a powerful socialist country, it is 
imperative to have a strong and unified central leadership, and 
unified planning and discipline throughout the country. 
Disruption of this indispensable unity is impermissible. At 
the same time, it is essential to bring the initiative of local 
authorities into full play, and to let each locality enjoy what 
is particularity suited to its local conditions. Since the 
differences between various localities in China in terms of 
natural, social, and cultural conditions, and the level of 
economic development are so great, it is impossible to demand 
conformity in everything. There is obviously a dualistic 
structure in the coastal area, the interior, the southeast, the 
northwest, in urban and rural areas, and developed and backward 
regions. Furthermore, our commodity economy and domestic markets 
are not developed, and the proportions of natural and 
seminatural economies still are fairly high. This has decided 
that we need a unified planning and program to organize local 
economic operations effectively. In the meantime, we must not 
neglect regional differences that objectively exist, or the 
local interests caused by such differences. 
  Therefore, in the process of deepening our reforms in the 
future, we must handle well the relationship between the central 
administration and the localities. On the one hand, we must 
continue to arouse the enthusiasm of localities for economic 
development and must maintain their economic vigor. On the 
other hand, while further transforming enterprise operational 
mechanisms and cultivating the market system in order to 
strengthen local economic capabilities, the central 
administration will increase the weight of macroeconomic 
regulation and control, with emphasis on finance, tax, monetary 
matters, investments, the planning system, and so on, so as to 
prevent anarchy in economic operations, or an economy of feudal 
princes.

<F P=106> ["Regional Party Committee's Enlarged Meeting Comes to </F>
Successful End -- Calling for Emancipating Minds To Accelerate 
Pace of Reform and Opening-up and To Achieve High Growth Rate in 
High Pioneering Spirit"] 
  [Excerpts] The sixth (enlarged) plenary session of the 
fourth regional party committee ended yesterday afternoon. The 
session called on party organizations at various levels, 
Communist Party members, and the people of various nationalities 
across the region, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and led by the 
party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, to 
bestir themselves, work hard for the prosperity of the country, 
advance in a pioneering spirit, and strive to accomplish the 
strategic objectives set by the 14th party congress and the 
Third Plenary Session of the party's 14th Central Committee and 
to carry out the tasks of reform and development set by the 
regional party committee for this year. 
  Abulaiti Amudurexiti, deputy secretary of the regional party 
committee and acting chairman of the region, presided over 
yesterday afternoon's meeting. Song Hanliang, secretary of the 
regional party committee, made a concluding speech. [passage 
omitted] 
  In his speech, Song Hanliang stressed: To further promote 
Xinjiang's reform and development, the most crucial thing is to 
emancipate our minds and seek truth from facts. In recent 
years, Xinjiang's economy has developed rather fast. But 
compared with other parts of the country, especially some 
coastal and inland provinces and regions, our growth rate is far 
behind theirs, and the gap between our region and those 
provinces and regions continues to widen. Objectively speaking, 
Xinjiang had a poor foundation to start with, and another 
important reason is that it is far away from economic centers 
and developed areas. However, the most crucial matter remaining 
is that we have not sufficiently emancipated our minds. So the 
biggest gap is a gap in conception [guan nian shang de cha ju 
6034 1819 0006 4104 1567 6415]. First, some of our comrades 
have yet to ideologically solve the question of whether a move 
is "socialist" or "capitalist." It can be said that they still 
have "doubts and misgivings in mind." When they are faced with 
a matter, they still ask themselves first "which course to 
take." Some other comrades have seemed to free themselves from 
the trammels of whether a move is "socialist" or "capitalist," 
but they have a "lingering fear" -- glancing about, they are 
afraid of "taking risks" and of "changes." They just cannot 
stride forward. Second, our region has been deeply fettered and 
influenced by the traditional structure of planned economy for a 
long time, and some of our comrades are still ideologically 
shackled by the old concept of planned economy. Third, the 
traditional, self-sufficient oasis economy has given rise to an 
ingrained sense of isolation, complacency, and conservatism 
among people. As a result, they lack the idea of opening to the 
outside world and the spirit of forging ahead. Fourth, as an 
autonomous region inhabited by minority nationalities, Xinjiang 
must consider its own characteristics in carrying out reform and 
development, which is undoubtedly correct. This is also a matter 
we must always pay close attention to. But "the theory of a 
minority region being special" is incorrect. When touching on 
reform, some comrades always stress the "special conditions" in 
the region and warn against taking big strides. They want to do 
things slowly and hope to receive more special consideration. 
When touching on changing ideas, they stress objectivity and 
history; they dare not to boldly break away from old or outworn 
ideas. [passage omitted] 
  Song Hanliang emphasized: The party's basic line means "one 
central task and two basic points." The key to implementing the 
party's basic line in an all-round way lies in unswervingly 
carrying out economic construction as the central task. Because 
our region has been deeply fettered and influenced by the 
traditional structure of planned economy for a long time, some 
of our comrades are still ideologically shackled by the old 
concept of planned economy. Although given a good opportunity to 
carry out reforms and open to the outside world, some comrades 
have failed to seize the opportunity and to boldly try things 
out and develop themselves; they are still keen on seeking ways 
to get help and let slip a golden opportunity. Putting fear 
before everything else, some cadres are just used to being an 
official in a tranquil environment and living a peaceful life. 
They not only do not do but even dare not think about what is 
not said in a book or official document or by a leader, or what 
is not done by others. In a word, they are afraid of touching 
on "capitalism." Still some other comrades always complain 
about the macroenvironment and the macroclimate although they 
have yet to clean out the silt (yu ji 3226 4480] in the depths 
of their hearts. As a matter of fact, to boldly carry out 
reforms and open to the outside world, it is very important for 
us to untie, surpass, and liberate ourselves. For what we 
regard as correct, we should not wait, delay, or depend on 
others but resolutely do it. When we are not sure for the time 
being whether we can succeed in doing something, we also should 
not wait, delay, or depend on others but explore and try it 
boldly. The basic criterion for judging whether a move is 
"socialist" or "capitalist" is whether or not it is conducive to 
developing the productive forces of socialist society, 
increasing the overall strength of the socialist country, and 
improving the people's living standards. Only by honestly 
admitting that we are ideologically behind, only by further 
emancipating our minds, and only by breaking ideological 
shackles will we be able to strike forward in carrying out 
reform and opening to the outside world. Only by so doing will 
we be able to make rapid economic developments with high 
efficiency. 
  To implement the "decision" [adopted by the plenary 
session], 
it is crucial to have a good mentality, to improve our work 
style and efficiency, and to create a fast-paced, highly 
efficient work environment for reform, opening-up, and economic 
development. Conditions in Xinjiang are different from those in 
developed coastal areas, and conditions vary from prefecture to 
prefecture even in the autonomous region. So we should not 
indiscriminately copy instructions from higher levels [bu neng 
zhao ban zhao chao shang ji zhi shi 0008 5174 3564 2239 3564 
2113 0006 4787 2172 4355] and experiences from other areas. We 
must grasp what the instructions from higher levels really mean 
as well as the conditions at lower levels, and do our work 
creatively according to actual conditions. We should not stress 
conditions only, nor should we disregard such conditions. We 
should suit measures to local conditions and give specific 
guidance. Doing away with the practice of idle talk, we should 
concentrate our energies on our work; we should make more time 
for study and engage in as little socializing as possible. We 
should do more research and investigation and refrain from 
subjectivism; we should do more practical work and less empty 
talk. The masses have a potentially inexhaustible enthusiasm for 
socialism and potentially inexhaustible creativity, which are 
waiting for us to guide and develop. Leaders at various levels 
should go deep into the realities of life and immerse themselves 
among the masses to acquaint themselves with new conditions and 
problems arising in reform and construction; they should sum up 
and popularize new creations and experiences made by the masses; 
and they should unite and lead the masses of various 
nationalities in carrying out reforms, building enterprises 
through arduous effort, and implementing the guidelines and the 
"decision" adopted by the sixth (enlarged) plenary session of 
the fourth regional party committee.

1472): "The Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Government 
Cosponsor Report Meeting To Sum Up 1993 Work and Arrange 1994 
Work"] 
  [Text] From 8 to 10 January, the municipal party committee 
and the municipal government cosponsored a report meeting to sum 
up the work done in 1993 by departments, commissions, and 
offices and to make 1994 work arrangements. Chen Xitong, 
secretary of the municipal party committee, pointed out in his 
speech: The principles for guiding this year's work are to 
emancipate the mind, firmly grasp favorable opportunities, make 
breakthroughs in key areas, and make bigger strides for reform 
and construction so as to realize the target of becoming fairly 
well-off ahead of schedule. 
  Li Qiyan, mayor of the municipal government, chaired the 
report meeting. Making reports at the meeting were responsible 
persons of the municipal planning commission, the municipal 
scientific and technological commission, the municipal 
commercial commission, the municipal commission for foreign 
economic relations and trade, the municipal economic 
restructuring commission, the organizational department and the 
propaganda department under the municipal party committee, and 
the municipal agricultural office. 
  Last year, the municipality created a new situation in 
reform 
and opening up, comprehensively increased economic targets, and 
comprehensively fulfilled or surpassed the 38 planned targets of 
nine major categories that were approved at the first session of 
the 10th municipal people's congress. In 1993, the GNP reached 
85.2 billion yuan, an increase of 12 percent when calculated in 
terms of comparable prices. The grain output reached 2.84 
billion yuan and the per unit yield of grain reached 690 
kilograms, setting a record. The total industrial output value 
reached 125.6 billion yuan, an increase of 18.5 percent. The 
profits and taxes realized by the enterprises at or above the 
township level reached 15.42 billion yuan, an increase of 15 
percent. The total volume of retail sales of commodities 
reached 54.92 billion yuan, an increase of 27.8 percent. Local 
investment in fixed assets reached 27.1 billion yuan, an 
increase of 49.4 percent. A total of 11 million square meters 
of houses were built, including 5.5 million square meters of 
residential houses. A total of 3,752 new foreign-funded 
enterprises of three types were approved and $6.28 billion worth 
of foreign capital were used according to agreements, 
respectively increasing by 70 percent and 3.3 times. The volume 
of export through foreign trade totaled $1.698 billion, an 
increase of 10.6 percent. A total of 2.03 million overseas 
tourists were received, an increase of 16.1 percent. Foreign 
exchange earnings reached $1.24 billion, an increase of 15.9 
percent. The local revenues reached 8.41 billion yuan, an 
increase of 4.8 percent. 
  Viewing the general situation, we know that last year, the 
national economy of the municipality developed in a sound and 
orderly way, the biggest improvement was made in the appearance 
of urban areas, new breakthroughs were made in deepening reform, 
key strides were made in building markets, the biggest 
breakthroughs were made in using foreign capital, and people's 
livelihood was noticeably improved. 
  Li Qiyan said in his summing-up speech: This report meeting 
has been successful. All departments, commissions, and offices 
have made full preparations, conscientiously studied the summing 
up of the 1993 work and the arrangements for the 1994 work, and 
worked out new ideas for 1994's work. The report meeting 
implements the guidelines of Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th Party Central Committee and generally upgrades the 
understanding about the policy on linking theory with practice. 
Many reports dialectically ponder over problems. All this shows 
that the people have new ideas and good skills and are full of 
the awareness of emancipating the mind, conducting reform, and 
opening to the outside world. Many reform projects of 
breakthrough significance, as set forth in the reports, have new 
ideas and embody the new measures conforming to the current 
international big markets. The way of thinking is clear. We 
have great determination and forceful and solid measures to 
speed up the capital's modernization. The report meeting makes 
a good start in carrying out the municipality's work in 1994 and 
helps lay a good foundation for realizing the 1994 fighting 
goals. We should strive to make greater achievements. 
  Chen Xitong started out in his speech by expounding on the 
guiding principle for the work of the whole municipality during 
this year. He said: The year 1994 is the first year for 
comprehensively implementing the decision of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th Party Central Committee on the establishment 
of the socialist market economic structure, an important year 
for realizing the goal of becoming well-off three years ahead of 
schedule, and a year of increased domestic and international 
opportunities for us. In line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, we have proposed the guiding principles for 
the work of the whole municipality during 1994 through 
conducting investigation and studies, extensively listening to 
opinions, and holding consultation and discussions in all 
sectors on emancipating the mind, seizing opportunity, making 
major breakthroughs, meeting the goal of becoming well-off ahead 
of schedule, and making greater strides in reform and 
construction. 
  Chen Xitong said: Emancipating the mind is an endless 
long-term task. Emancipating the mind is aimed at seeking truth 
from facts, unceasingly freeing ourselves from the shackle of 
idealism and mataphysics, and understanding and transforming the 
objective world in line with dialectics. Just as Comrade Jiang 
Zemin said: "Emancipating the mind is aimed at making ideology 
match reality, and subjectivity match objectivity, in other 
words, it means seeking truth from facts." We conducted general 
discussions on emancipation of minds for four successive years, 
and each discussion brought progress in ideology and played an 
active role in promoting all fields of work. What is the 
priority of the municipality's emancipation of mind during this 
year? Generally speaking, the priority is to further emancipate 
the minds in line with the work of accelerating the 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure, 
expanding the extent of reform, establishing a modern enterprise 
system, and firmly seizing the opportunity to accelerate 
development in difficult and hot spots that disrupt the progress 
of all departments and units. Specifically speaking, priorities 
in emancipating minds this year are: 
  First, we should continue to emancipate the minds according 
to the rate of development. The development rate of Beijing 
last year was quite rapid at 12 percent. Our problem is that we 
cannot seem to make it faster. The development rate of Beijing 
is lower than the national average and lower than Shanghai and 
Tianjin. A gap exists when compared with the favorable 
conditions of the capital. If we give further play to advantages 
and tap into potential, it is possible for us to achieve faster 
development. This development rate should be realistic and 
sound. 
  Second, we should further emancipate the mind in building 
the 
socialist market economic structure. In building the socialist 
market economic structure, we should pay attention to the law of 
value, give play to the basic regulatory role of market 
mechanisms, and at the same time, build a sound marcoeconomic 
regulation and control system, and never take blind action. 
Macroeconomic regulation and control is not a synonym of the 
planned economy, therefore, we must not regard it as going back 
on the old track. We should comprehensively understand this, 
and never be one-sided. 
  Third, we should further emancipate the mind in running 
state-owned, large and medium-sized enterprises. State-owned, 
large and medium-sized enterprises are the leading forces of the 
socialist market economy. We must invigorate them because if we 
fail to do it this way, it will be impossible for us to 
establish the socialist market economic structure. One-third 
of the number of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises 
are good, average, and running in the red. We should try our 
best to invigorate enterprises that have heavy internal burdens 
but are needed by the market by pushing them forward with help 
and support to operate in order to serve the market economy, and 
strive to invigorate them. 
  Fourth, we broke the old structure and stressed the 
importance of daring to go ahead, to blaze new trials, and to 
take risks in reform and construction, and now central 
authorities have formulated a basic pattern for the socialist 
market economy and will establish a new structure, so is it 
still necessary for us to go ahead, to blaze new trials, and to 
take risks? We believe that in building a new structure, we 
still need to advocate the practice of daring to go ahead, blaze 
new trials and take risks. Because the old structure has not 
been completely eliminated, shackles and obstacles remain, and 
many old things have yet to completely disappear from the stage. 
The newly established systems also need to be replenished, 
revised, implemented, developed, and improved in practice. We 
should make bold explorations and experiments for the new system 
by proceeding from realities. We should also continue to 
emancipate the mind and dare to give everything a try and go 
ahead. 
  Fifth, we should further overcome blind complacency and a 
passive pessimistic view. It is a lopsided view to feel 
complacent over a little bit achievements and then refuse to 
make progress. It is also a lopsided view to blame others and 
shift responsibilities onto external reasons whenever there is a 
difficulty and then refuse to exploit one's subjective activity. 
Both of these views should be tackled conscientiously. 
  Sixth, we should overcome the situation in which some units 
have been weak in doing one thing but tough in doing another, or 
have been tough in words on both but stressed on neither in 
deeds. Failing to overcome such a metaphysical situation will 
affect the central link of economic construction. We must 
persist in the principle of taking a two-handed approach and 
being tough with both hands. This is the only way to ensure the 
smooth progress of economic construction. 
  Seventh, we should overcome the idea of choosing and 
promoting cadres according to seniority. In using cadres, we 
should persist in the requirements of making cadres more 
revolutionary, younger, better educated, and professionally more 
competent and making cadres have ability and political 
integrity. We should solve the problem concerning the provision 
of leading bodies at various levels. We should boldly choose 
and promote young cadres. This is a long-term policy, and we 
must emancipate our mind in this regard. 
  Chen Xitong stressed: Only by emancipating the mind can we 
blaze new ideas and act boldly. If we are plagued by all sorts 
of fears and dare not to do this or that, we will be unable to 
make big progress. New ideas, bold actions, and emancipation of 
the mind are closely integrated. All units and all departments 
should emancipate whatever binds their ideas and actions. By 
doing so, they can go all out to do their work without 
restrictions, make progress rapidly, and accelerate the pace of 
reform and opening up. 
  When talking about the seizure of opportunity, Chen Xitong 
pointed out: Opportunity is a special manifestation at the 
present stage, and it does not exist at any stage. Failing to 
seize the opportunity, it will be missed. The present situation 
at home and abroad is extremely advantageous to our development, 
and thus it is a race opportunity. Seizing the opportunity 
loosely means failing to seize it. We must firmly seize the 
opportunity, cherish it, and make good use of it so that we can 
beef up the economy. Just like some comrades said, seizing the 
opportunity means having new resources, new financial sources, 
and high growth speed. Some comrades have failed to seize the 
opportunity because they have caught sight of things belatedly, 
understood things slowly, and lacked the sense of 
responsibility, the sense of urgency, and the sense of crisis. 
Some other comrades have lacked practical experiences and 
indulged in empty talks. Still others have aimed too high and 
buried themselves in studies all day long, thus missing 
opportunities. We should keep firmly in mind what Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping said, that is, "the opportunity should be seized and 
policy decisions should be made in time," otherwise, "the time 
will pass in a flash." Therefore, seizing the opportunity 
should be regarded as a principle for our work this year. 
  Chen Xitong said: By making breakthroughs in key areas, we 
mean to make breakthroughs in major contradictions, in central 
links, or in key points. Without emphasis, there will be no 
policies, and our work cannot be promoted. This year, the 
central and key point of the work of the entire municipality 
still lies in economic work. We should achieve success in the 
work in all fields around the central link of economic 
construction. Each field has its own major contradictions. 
Only by making breakthroughs in major contradictions first and 
solving non-essential contradictions second can we achieve 
results in our work. To find out correct points in making 
breakthroughs, we are required to conduct investigation and 
study and think it over conscientiously. All fronts should sort 
out their contradictions, put them in right order, and strive to 
solve them in the order of importance. This means making 
breakthroughs in key areas. We should solve a central problem 
in a period, and solve some major problems throughout a year. 
Successfully solving problems, we will make a breakthrough and 
make big progress. As all fronts have their own special 
contradictions and key areas, we should not use a fixed pattern 
to address their problems. When issues of a specific character 
are resolved, it will be easy to resolve the issues of a general 
character. Achieving a fairly comfortable living standard three 
years ahead of time is an issue regarding general character, in 
which making mountainous areas prosper, people's housing 
problem, and the problems of low-income workers require great 
efforts to resolve. We should also pay attention to the work of 
social stability and the spiritual civilization. As long as the 
key areas are clearly defined and breakthroughs are made in 
them, greater progress will be achieved in the work of the 
municipality. 
  Speaking on strengthening party building and improving party 
leadership, Chen Xitong said: Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out 
that we should "strengthen and improve party building, strive to 
raise the party's ruling and leadership levels, and enable our 
long-tested Marxist party to play a better role as the 
leadership core in the great cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics." To make a greater step in reform and 
construction this year, we need to carry out plenty of work, and 
we must not slacken efforts in party building. We should step 
up efforts to achieve two improvements. First, we should make 
unremitting efforts to achieve ideological and theoretical 
improvement. The major tasks are to deeply study Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. After reading 
through Volume 3, we should conduct intensive reading of special 
topics in an effort to understand it more thoroughly. In 
studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, the focus is to study and master dialectical 
materialism and historical materialism and to study their stand, 
viewpoints, and methods. We should use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a 
tool to attain Beijing's targets of reform, opening up, and 
construction and promote all work. Meanwhile, we should 
transform our world outlook and outlook on life and oppose money 
worship and ultra- individualism. In particular, leading cadres 
should embrace the communist world outlook and outlook on life 
and work hard all their life towards their ambitious goal. We 
should also coordinate the study of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping with the study of the basic theories of 
Marxist works, including philosophy, political economics, and 
scientific socialism. Only when we thoroughly understand the 
basic theories, can we acquire a better understanding of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theories. Ideological and theoretical 
improvement should be the criterion in assessing cadres, 
especially young cadres. Chen Xitong pointed out that focusing 
on establishing the socialist market economy system, we should 
study the knowledge on the market economy, the modern enterprise 
system, and modern science, technology, and management. He 
urged: The study should become a system, should be examined, 
supervised, and appraised, and should become a criterion for 
selecting and promoting cadres. Propaganda through the media and 
through cultural and art works should all be linked to Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and the major melody should be given prominence 
so that efforts can be pooled to achieve a fairly comfortable 
standard of living together. 
  Speaking on organizational improvement, Chen Xitong pointed 
out: The focus should be on improving leading bodies. 
Breakthroughs should be made in organizational work, especially 
in the orderly succession of cadres to make leading bodies 
younger. We should promote a number of young cadres who uphold 
the four cardinal principles, are loyal to the party's cause, 
and pay attention to the overall situation. We should also 
promote women cadres and cadres of minority nationalities and 
make a breakthrough in selecting cadres without party 
affiliation or with democratic parties to participate in the 
administration of state affairs. We should improve grass-roots 
organizations and build party branches well. In particular, we 
should be determined to rectify backward party branches and, at 
the same time, summarize the experiences of advanced party 
branches so as to promote the work of the middle branches of the 
party. We should build party organizations of enterprises and 
also pay attention to improving the party organizations of the 
three types of foreign-funded enterprises, collective 
enterprises, and private enterprises. Only when grass-roots 
organizations are improved, can the party fully develop its 
role. We should achieve success in improving party style and 
building a clean government. This is a major task concerning 
the life and death of our party. Administrative honesty should 
be linked with administrative diligence. Two major experiences 
were gained in the improvement of administrative honesty in the 
previous stage. First, meet with the masses to directly hear 
their opinions and accept their supervision. Second, 
administrative honesty is closely linked with administrative 
diligence, so be sure to be honest and diligent. We should 
always use the enthusiasm gained through improvement of 
administrative honesty to do good and real deeds for the people 
and start an upsurge before the Spring Festival. 
  Chen Xitong urged to vigorously promote the setup of 
socialist democracy and politics and pointed out the necessity 
to reform the political system accordingly while restructuring 
the economy. At present, we should achieve work in the 
following few aspects: First, we should further improve the 
people's congress system; strengthen and perfect the functions 
of the municipal, district, and county people's congresses and 
their standing committees; upgrade the prestige of the local 
organs of state power; bring into better play the functions of 
the people's deputies; and work out systems to enable the 
deputies to bring their functions into better play after the 
congresses. Second, we should further perfect the system of 
multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the 
leadership of the communist party and consolidate and develop 
the united front in the new situation. We should continue to 
persist in the principle of "long-term coexistence, mutual 
supervision, showing utter devotion, and sharing woe and weal"; 
strengthen and improve the leadership of the party; and bring 
into full play various democratic parties and non party 
personages' roles in participating in and discussing political 
affairs and conducting democratic supervision. We should 
strengthen the consultation and discussions with democratic 
parties; improve the work of handling the motions put forward by 
the democratic parties, including the federations of industry 
and commerce; and positively create conditions for democratic 
parties to participate in and discuss political affairs and 
conduct democratic supervision. The party-member cadres at 
various levels should pay attention to the united front work and 
strengthen the work toward nationalities, the religious work, 
and the work toward Taiwan. Third, the most important 
foundation of the united front is the masses of workers and 
peasants. The key to ensuring that the masses of the people 
play the role as a master is to carry forward democracy, to make 
the people have the right to handling their own affairs, to link 
responsibility with right and benefits, and actually mobilize 
the people's enthusiasm for being the master of the people. 
Fourth, we should achieve the setup of the socialist legal 
system. Without the legal system, there will be no guarantee 
for the sustained, fast, and smooth progress of the national 
economy. We should speed up the legislation to promote the 
setup of the socialist market economic system, strengthen the 
construction of the law enforcement worker contingents, attend 
to the education on general knowledge of laws, and really ensure 
that there are laws to abide by. Fifth, we should safeguard the 
political and social stability of the capital just as we cherish 
our eyes. This is of primary importance. Development creates 
conditions for stability, and stability provides an environment 
for development. One's existence depends on the another. 
  Chen Xitong stressed the necessity to vigorously advocate 
the 
tendencies of conducting investigations and study. Last year, 
we did this for the whole year and made good achievements. This 
year, we should continuously persist in it. This is a 
fundamental duty for leading organs. The leading organs of the 
municipal party committee and the municipal government, 
departments, commissions, offices, districts, counties, bureaus, 
and all units should work out plans for investigations and 
study. It will be possible to form a regular work method if we 
persist in it for several years. Through investigations and 
study, all units should report back as to what aspects they have 
emancipated their minds in, what obstacles they have in grasping 
favorable opportunities, what contradictions they should solve, 
and what methods they should adopt to solve contradictions. All 
these should be regarded as the main contents of the 
investigation and study activities as well as the basis for 
year-end examinations. 
  Li Qiyan urged that all departments should relay and 
implement the guidelines of the meeting, readjust their own work 
plans, divide their planned tasks to lower levels, and ensure 
the implementation of the tasks. Before the Spring Festival, we 
should further do solid and concrete deeds for the people; 
achieve the things that have direct bearings on the personal 
interests of the people, such as market supply and the supply of 
gas, heat, and electricity; and also resolutely ban the setting 
off of firecrackers. 
  Present at the meeting were some municipal leaders, 
including 
Zhang Jianmin, Wang Daming, Li Zhijian, Zhang Baifa, and Wang 
Baosen.

  [Text] United Nations, February 15 (XINHUA) -- The 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today informed the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that DPRK accepted the 
IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  According to a U.N. press release, following discussions 
held 
in Vienna during the recent months the DPRK authorities accepted 
the inspection activities requested by the IAEA in the seven 
declared nuclear facilities. 
  The release said the DPRK representatives conveyed their 
authorities' acceptance following the explanations and 
clarifications that the agency had provided during the 
discussions. 
  Inspectors would take certain measures, such as reloading of 
cameras and changing of seals, to facilitate future 
verification, it said, adding that the aim of the inspection 
activities was to verify that nuclear material in these 
facilities had not been diverted since earlier inspections. 
  Welcoming the new development, the IAEA had confirmed today 
in writing to the DPRK the agency's readiness to send a team of 
inspectors to the DPRK as soon as the necessary formalities for 
entry had been arranged. 
  For the past several months, the DPRK and the United States 
had had many rounds of negotiations on inspection activities.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Feb 15 (AFP)--A group of Hong Kong-based 
U.S. Christian missionaries returned to the colony Tuesday after 
being detained for five days under China's sweeping new laws to 
control religious activity. 
  Cathy Balcombe, wife of Reverend Dennis Balcombe of the 
Revival Christian Church, said her husband and his companions 
returned from China late in the day, exhausted and hungry. 
  "They are very tired," she said, adding that Balcombe was 
not 
giving telephone interviews for the time being. 
  Amnesty International had earlier said that a total of 10 
Christians had been detained in central China last week, but the 
U.S. Embassy in Beijing said Tuesday that the three Americans 
among them had been freed. 
  Two Indonesians, two Hong Kong residents, and three Chinese 
detained along with the Americans were apparently still being 
held by the Public Security Bureau in Henan province, the 
London-based human rights group reported. 
  They were believed to be the first Christians detained under 
new regulations governing religion which took effect January 31 
and restrict the religious activities of foreigners in China. 
  The U.S. Embassy said in a statement it had been informed by 
the Henan authorities that "the American Christians were 
released this morning." 
  Police and religious affairs bureau officials in the central 
province, contacted by AFP by telephone, said they were "unaware 
of the whole affair." 
  Amnesty International said Balcombe, Daughin Chan and Paul 
Star, all U.S. nationals, were put under house arrest in a 
guesthouse in Fangcheng city following their detention last 
Thursday. 
  They were detained along with Hong Kongers Kok Fai Kwok and 
May Chong, Indonesian nationals Bam Bang Yang and Ina Yang, and 
three unidentified Chinese. 
  Amnesty urged the Chinese authorities to release the 
detainees, saying they were "at risk of being held without 
charge" for carrying out "peaceful religious activities." 
  Amnesty said the detainees "should be released 
unconditionally if not promptly charged with recognizable 
criminal offences in accordance with international standards." 
  It said the three Chinese were being held separately from 
the 
foreigners, who had been in Fangcheng since February 8 and 
intended to meet with Christians in villages in Henan.

latest funding package for the new airport. The Chinese team 
leader of the Joint Liason Group, Guo Fengmin, says Beijing has 
studied the fourth financial package but it needs to discuss the 
remaining problems with the Hong Kong Government. The latest 
package implies that the government will inject equity worth 
about 60,000 million dollars into the project. However, Mr Guo 
refused to say whether the problems relate to the size of the 
government's equity injection. He added that the Sino-British 
Airport Committee would discuss the land to be granted along the 
airport rail link and he hoped that the committee could meet 
soon.

1627): "Usher in a New Situation for Work Consultations--A 
Spring Festival Gift to Compatriots on Both Sides of Taiwan 
Strait"] 
  [Text] Plum blossoms herald the spring. On the eve of the 
Chinese New Year, a traditional festival of the Chinese nation, 
the fact that great progress was made and several common 
consensuses were reached in the talks between the heads of the 
Association for Relations Across the Straits [ARATS] and the 
Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] in Beijing has brought a 
meaningful spring-festival gift to compatriots on the two sides 
of the Taiwan Strait. 
  Following the Wang-Koo talks, ARATS and SEF held three 
rounds 
of talks on routine affairs in Beijing, Xiamen, and Taipei. 
This time, ARATS Executive Vice President Tang Shubei, and Zou 
Zhekai, vice president and secretary general, held frank and 
wide-ranging consultations with Chiao Jen-ho, SEF vice chairman 
and secretary general, on the work and routine affairs of the 
two organizations and on related issues. During consultations, 
the two sides maintained that they should avoid political issues 
with pragmatic attitudes. They discussed three routine topics 
which included the repatriation of personnel entering each 
other's territory in violation of relevant provisions and other 
related issues, and they reached a high degree of consensus. 
They agreed that the fourth round of consultations on routine 
affairs will be held in Beijing and unanimously agreed that in 
the fourth round, they will exchange views or hold consultations 
on a number of economic, scientific, and technological topics as 
listed in the common agreement at the Wang- Koo talks. We can 
say that with their concerted efforts this time, some 
differences in previous routine affairs consultations between 
ARATS and SEF have been resolved, to a considerable extent, 
laying the groundwork for the routine affairs consultations next 
time. Mr. Chiao Jen-ho said: "This is conducive to the ties 
and cooperation between ARATS and SEF in the future and 
conducive to promoting the virtuous and interactive development 
of relations between the two sides of the Strait." 
  The talks this time lasted for five days and were very 
fruitful. The experience of the talks this time and the 
preceding rounds of consultations gives us these inspirations: 
  First, for routine affairs consultations, we should insist 
on 
the nongovernmental role of ARATS and SEF. Their major 
functions are to handle specific routine problems arising from 
contacts and exchanges between the two sides of the Strait. The 
two organizations, whose roles are clearly specified in their 
own articles, are officially empowered nongovernmental bodies. 
Having a good understanding of this, one does not need to 
attach too much political significance to the contacts and 
consultations between the organizations. 
  One still recalls that at last year's Wang-Koo talks in 
Singapore, the two sides of the Straits stressed ARATS's and 
SEF's nongovernmental and economic nature, their being limited 
to handling routine affairs, and their functionality. Precisely 
because the two sides adhered to this pragmatic spirit, the 
Wang-Koo talks were a complete success. In the wake of the 
Wang-Koo talks, some people in Taiwan argued that they gave 
prominence to the fact that "the two sides of the Strait are 
divided and ruled separately, and are on an equal footing." 
These irresponsible remarks which did not tell the truth about 
the facts have made the just-begun routine affairs consultations 
between ARATS and SEF more complicated and more politicized and 
are, at a time when the political differences between the two 
sides of the Straits have not been resolved today, nonconducive 
to promoting the building up of mutual trust between ARATS and 
SEF and between the two sides of the Straits, and nonconducive 
to the smooth development of relations between the two sides of 
the Straits. 
  At the consultations this time, the two sides reached a 
common consensus on adhering to the nongovernmental nature of 
the routine affairs consultations between ARATS and SEF and 
avoiding sensitive political issues. This is objective and 
pragmatic and will play a positive role in the implementation of 
the various agreements reached at the Wang-Koo talks and in 
future consultations on routine affairs topics. 
  Second, keeping the linking channels between ARATS and SEF 
unblocked is an important means for the two sides of the Straits 
to improve understanding and strengthen mutual trust. The two 
sides of the Straits have been separated for a very long time, 
and their differences have deepened. The establishment of a 
systemized linking and communication channel will undoubtedly 
help alleviate their differences and clear up their 
misunderstandings, "erecting a bridge of friendship and paving a 
road to success" for the development of relations between the 
two sides of the Straits. 
  One important achievement at the Wang-Koo talks was the 
signing of an agreement on the system of ties and talks between 
the two sides of the Straits. The function and obligation of 
ARATS and SEF are to implement the agreement loyally. Over the 
past year, ARATS has been positive and serious about 
implementing the agreement. Last November, in order to strictly 
implement the provision in the agreement that the secretaries 
general or vice presidents of ARATS and SEF have one meeting 
every six months, ARATS took the initiative to write to SEF, 
inviting Mr. Chiao Jen-ho to Beijing for a meeting. Afterward, 
they went through a tortuous course: Tang Shubei could not make 
a trip to Taiwan for some reason on the Taiwan side, and Mr. 
Chiao "had to reconsider whether or not he would have to 
postpone" his trip to Beijing. Therefore, the talks this time 
did not begin with ease, and the achievements made should be 
cherished doubly. 
  Meeting with Mr. Jen-ho Chiao, Director Wang Zhaoguo said: 
"Although ARATS and SEF are nongovernmental organizations, their 
good or bad cooperation can often reflect the development of 
relations between the two sides of the Strait. Despite the fact 
that the two sides of the Strait still have political 
differences, it is very important to establish a channel of 
communication on issues of routine affairs." This affirms the 
function and significance of keeping the linking channel 
unblocked between the two organizations from a higher and wider 
field of vision. Based on this, we maintain that, on the one 
hand, the two sides should strictly abide by the relevant 
agreements and continue to keep the linking and communication 
channel, unblocked between the two organizations, and that, on 
the other hand, it is of course good if the two sides can reach 
agreement or consensus at each round of consultations, and if 
they fail, they should not be disappointed because there is hope 
and there will be achievements as long as they come into contact. 
  The saying runs: One makes plans in the spring. The talks 
this time was the first consultations between the heads of the 
two organizations following the Wang-Koo talks as well as their 
first contact and consultations in 1994. The success of the 
talks is a good beginning for ties and cooperation between the 
two organizations and for various routine affairs consultations 
between them for this year. Compatriots on the two sides of the 
Straits look forward to the earliest possible implementation of 
the important consensuses reached at the talks in their 
consultations and relevant agreements.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 15 Feb (XINHUA) -- Vice President Rong 
Yiren recently inspected work in Guangdong and emphatically 
noted: In establishing a socialist market economy, it is 
necessary to attach importance to and meet people's increasing 
demands for material and spiritual culture. Every economic 
activity should be profitable, but that does not mean we should 
be intent on nothing but profit. As long as we develop material 
civilization as well as spiritual civilization, the prospects 
for developing a socialist market economy are great. 
  In the company of Lin Ruo and Xie Songkai, chairman and vice 
chairman of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress Standing 
Committee, and Vice Governor Li Lanfang, Rong Yiren visited 
large state enterprises, Zhuhai Special Economic Zone [SEZ], a 
high agro-technology breeding base, and farmers' markets for 
inspection from 1 to 15 February. 
  In Jiangmen Fufa Glass Factory, Rong Yiren was briefed on 
the 
factory's situation. Production has been in a depression since 
operations began in 1988. The factory registered over 10 
million yuan in losses in 1991. In the past two years they 
strived to develop markets and vigorously set up joint ventures, 
and last year they registered 140 million yuan in profits and 
taxes. After the briefing, Rong Yiren said happily: It was not 
easy for you to withstand losses and develop at such a rate over 
the past two years; you should seriously sum up experiences and 
lessons. Under the new situation of an increasingly changable 
market, output of some products should be cut back, whereas that 
of others should be increased greatly. It is very good that you 
have met the market's demands and enhanced the enterprise's 
staying power by relying on scientific progress, engaging in 
sophisticated processing, and developing new products. State 
enterprises can expand their scale of production and business 
scope by running joint ventures with foreign capital, but they 
should pay attention to properly assessing state assets and make 
sure that their value is maintained and increased. While 
foreign investors are making money through the joint ventures, 
we should not be suffering losses. This is equality and mutual 
benefit. 
  Rong Yiren visited Zhongshan Weili Group Corporation's two 
production lines for washing machines and air conditioners, 
carefully inquiring into the company's production, management, 
and development plan. He emphatically noted: Enterprises 
should grasp the word "competition" in development. An unwaning 
competitiveness should be built up by constantly meeting 
people's demands. This will require excellent product quality, 
a steady stream of new products, and good after-sale service. 
Many enterprises with difficulties should study your new 
development method of upgrading technology and developing new 
products on your own. 
  At the beginning of the [lunar] new year, Rong Yiren 
inspected western Zhuhai's port and airport, still under 
construction, in spite of the rain and was briefed on Zhuhai's 
development by Liang Guangda, party secretary and mayor. He 
expressed his satisfaction with the achievements made in Zhuhai 
SEZ and its overall development program currently under way. He 
hoped that comrades in Zhuhai would make meticulous plans, 
develop steadily, and do a good job in two important tasks -- 
collecting capital for construction and absorbing persons of 
different skills. Rong Yiren also went to Jiangmen Ostrich 
Breeding Farm and three farmers' markets in rural areas of 
Zhongshan City. He encouraged agrotechnologists in Jiangmen 
City to promote ostrich breeding -- a highly technological 
project with good economic returns -- strive to industrialize, 
and create a new industry through scientific means. 
  On the eve of the Spring Festival, Rong Yiren extended his 
holiday greetings to citizens of Zhongshan City and Overseas 
Chinese via TV in Zhongshan City -- a city known as hometown of 
many Overseas Chinese. He warmly welcomed "fellow townsmen" 
abroad to come back and have a look at their hometown and 
generously support its economic construction.

<F P=106> [Article by Peng Lixun (1756 4539 8113) from the "Earnestly </F>
Study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" column: "Deng Xiaoping's Idea of Building 
Special Economic Zones Is Successfully Put Into Practice in 
Shenzhen"] 
  [Text] Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea about building special 
economic zones is an important part of the theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
said: "A special economic zone is a window on technology, 
management, and knowledge as well as a window on foreign policy. 
From the special economic zones, we can introduce technology, 
acquire knowledge, and learn management skills, which are also a 
kind of knowledge. The special economic zones can function as 
bases for opening up, thus not only enabling us to gain benefit 
in the economic field and in the field of training competent 
personnel but also in expanding our country's foreign 
influence." Comrade Xiaoping's brilliant thesis on special 
economic zones gave a scientific expression to the position and 
functions of the special economic zones in opening up and their 
significance in our country's four modernizations and also 
directly guided the construction and development of the special 
economic zones in our country and promoted the great practice of 
reform, opening, and modernization in the whole country through 
the exemplary role of the special economic zones. 
  The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone was China's first special 
economic zone founded and developed according to Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's personal design and guidance. Over the past 14 
years, under the guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics -- especially 
his idea about building special economic zones -- Shenzhen has 
developed from a backward border town into a modern metropolis, 
in which the productive forces have been growing rapidly and the 
people's living standards have been enhanced substantially. 
Between 1979 and 1992, the city's gross domestic product 
increased from 196 million yuan to 28.43 billion yuan, or 
multiplied 147 times; the gross income of the people [guo min 
shou ru 0948 3046 2392 0354] increased from 160 million yuan to 
19.35 billion yuan, or multiplied 121 times; the gross 
industrial output value increased form 70 million yuan to 37.138 
billion yuan, or multiplied 531 times; the annual export volume 
increased from $9.3 million to $5.097 billion, or multiplied 548 
times. The gigantic achievements in the construction of the 
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone fully demonstrated the strong 
vigor and dynamism of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on building 
special economic zones. 
<H3>  First, Going All Out To Develop an Outward-Oriented Economy 
and Accelerating the Process of Internationalizing Economic Life </H3>
  Comrade Xiaoping instructed that "the orientation of the 
special economic zones' economies should be shifted from the 
domestic market to the international market." That is to say, 
the special economic zone should go all out to develop an 
outward-oriented economy, and this is a major criterion for 
judging whether the special economic zone is being run 
successfully. 
  According to the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's instruction, 
the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone went all out to develop an 
outward-oriented economy. Through its efforts over more than 10 
years, Shenzhen has formed an outward-oriented economic 
structure which takes industry as the main component and is 
composed of industry, agriculture, trade, and technology. The 
zone has made great progress in the two aspects of introducing 
foreign funds and technologies and exporting products to earn 
foreign exchange. In 1992, Shenzhen concluded more than 10,000 
agreements and contracts for using overseas funds with more than 
30 countries and regions and had actually used $4.5 billion in 
foreign funds. In the aspect of using foreign funds, Shenzhen 
had gradually upgraded from the stage of processing materials, 
assembling parts and components supplied by external clients and 
processing materials according to external buyers' samples, and 
conducting compensation trade to the stage of establishing the 
three types of foreign-funded enterprises and moving from 
labor-intensive projects to capital-intensive and 
technology-intensive projects. In addition to the use of 
external funds, Shenzhen also attached importance to importing 
equipment, technology, and intellectual resources. At the same 
time, Shenzhen made efforts to develop its overseas markets, 
actively advanced transnational operations, and boldly 
participated in international competition and cooperation. In 
1992, Shenzhen had developed trade relations with 122 countries 
and regions throughout the world, and its import and export 
volume was close to $8 billion. In particular, the volume of 
exports exceeded $5 billion, taking second place among all large 
and medium cities in China. In 1992, exported products 
accounted for 56.8 percent of the total industrial output value. 
Shenzhen had also gradually become an "entrepot" for the vast 
interior of the Chinese mainland, as it exported products from 
the interior and imported materials, equipment, and technology 
needed by those areas. Facts have shown that breaking the 
closed economic pattern, continuing to open up, going all out to 
develop an outward-oriented economy, and realizing the 
internationalization of economic life are the fundamental 
requirements for giving play to the "window" functions of the 
special economic zone and is also the only way to successfully 
conduct economic development in the special economic zone. 
  In the course of developing its outward-oriented economy, 
Shenzhen brought in foreign capital to establish three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises. This used to be a controversial 
issue in the past. Some people maintained that this would 
develop capitalism and would affect the socialist public 
ownership system. During his inspection of the south in 1992, 
Comrade Xiaoping gave an explicit reply to this question by 
citing the facts in Shenzhen as an example. He said: "We 
should not fear the establishment of more foreign-funded 
enterprises, as long as we keep ourselves sober-minded. We have 
advantages, as we have large and medium state-owned enterprises 
and township and town enterprises. More importantly, political 
power is in our hands." He added: "The three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises are constrained by the political and 
economic conditions of our country, and they are a useful 
supplement to the socialist economy. In the final analysis, 
they are conducive to socialism." This is a scientific 
conclusion drawn from reality, and has great guiding 
significance in both theory and practice for the formation of 
the ownership structure with public ownership as the main body 
and with the individual economy, the private economy, and the 
foreign-funded economy as supplements, in which a variety of 
economic elements will coexist and bring about common 
development in the long term. 
<H3>  Second, Boldly Carry Out Economic Structural Reform and 
Establish a New Socialist Market Economic Structure </H3>
  The special economic zone should not only play a role as a 
window and a base in the course of opening up to the outside 
world, but should also play an experimental and sampling role in 
the course of reform and opening up to other domestic areas. 
Comrade Xiaoping emphasized many times: "The Shenzhen Special 
Economic Zone is an experiment." During his inspection tour to 
the south in 1992, he warmly affirmed that "Shenzhen's major 
experience is that it dared to make breakthroughs and break new 
ground [gan chuang 2413 7068]." This required that the special 
economic zone be courageous enough to carry out reform 
experiments and to make explorations and innovations by breaking 
through the old systems and conventions that hindered the 
development of the productive forces. 
  In the past more than 10 years, Shenzhen persistently 
carried 
out market-oriented economic structural reform and carried out 
bold and advance tests in many fields, thus providing a great 
deal of important experience for the in-depth development of 
economic structural reform throughout the country. 
  In the field of reforming the enterprise property rights 
system and transforming the enterprise operational mechanism, 
Shenzhen took the management system in the foreign-funded 
enterprises as a point of reference in the course of 
transforming the management system and the operational mechanism 
of the state-owned enterprises. In 1987, it took the lead in 
the whole country in setting up the state-owned assets 
management organ -- an investment management company -- thus 
separating the function of managing state assets from the 
economic functions of the government. This was a useful 
experiment in exploring ways to separate management power over 
state assets from state ownership. At the same time, Shenzhen 
also took the lead in the whole country in carrying out pilot 
schemes for the adoption of the joint-stock system. At the end 
of 1992, there were more than 150 share-limited companies in 
Shenzhen, and 24 of them had been listed on stock exchanges. 
Because their operational mechanism underwent rapid changes, 
the companies that had been listed on stock exchanges 
substantially increased their net assets, profits, and 
tax-profit contributions. Practice shows that the joint stock 
system is a good model for the reform of the enterprise property 
rights system. It is conducive to the clear definition of 
enterprise property rights, represents the separation of the 
ownership over the enterprise assets from management power over 
such assets, and remolds the enterprise into a commodity 
producer and dealer that operates on its own, bears sole 
responsibility for its own profits and business losses, has the 
ability to make development on its own and to exercise 
self-control. 
  In the field of cultivating the market, Shenzhen has 
basically formed a comprehensive market system full of dynamism. 
In Shenzhen, there are markets for consumer goods such as farm 
produce and manufactured goods for daily use; markets for 
producer goods such as building materials, mechanical and 
electrical equipment, electronic assembly parts, and nonferrous 
metals; service markets providing storage, transportation, 
communications, tourist, and cultural services; and also the 
auction market for movable property, the market for property 
rights transfers, and the futures market. Many of these markets 
have developed on a considerable scale. Various types of 
markets have become rather mature, and the degree of their 
openness is quite high. The market rules are almost perfect, 
and the competition is rather fair. Market operation has 
basically moved onto a healthy and orderly path. At the same 
time, prices are basically free, and price control is exercised 
on only a small number of goods and services. The prices of 
most commodities are determined according to the law of value 
and the supply-demand relationship on the market. The 
market-determined pricing mechanism has basically taken form. 
  In the area of transforming government functions and 
reforming economic control patterns through vertical and 
horizontal power devolution, government functions in Shenzhen 
have been gradually changed from direct to indirect economic 
control. Such economic means as financial and taxation 
policies, banking policies, foreign trade policies, and 
industrial policies have been used increasingly to regulate and 
control the market and guide enterprises. The economic 
functions of the government have been changed, and the 
enterprises have been basically separated from the government. 
  Over the past 14 years, Shenzhen constantly promoted 
development through reform and promoted economic growth at a 
high speed and in high efficiency through the transformation of 
the economic structure and the economic operational mechanism. 
Violent economic fluctuations were prevented. The vivid 
practice proved the correctness of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
brilliant thesis that "reform is also the emancipation of the 
productive forces." 
<H3>  Third, Correctly Using the Useful Achievements of Capitalism 
to Serve Socialist Construction </H3>
  Opening up to the outside world, developing an 
outward-oriented economy, reforming the old structure, and 
establishing a new market economic structure are all related to 
the correct use of the useful achievements of capitalism for our 
own purposes. Comrade Xiaoping explicitly pointed out: We 
should adopt and use all achievements of advanced civilization, 
including those made by the developed capitalist countries, to 
develop socialism. In a certain sense, a major point in the 
experiments of reform and opening in the Shenzhen Special 
Economic Zone is how to use the useful achievements of 
capitalism to serve socialist construction. This includes the 
development of foreign economic and trade relations, the 
adoption of foreign funds, the introduction of advanced 
technology and various types of professionals, the adoption of 
the advanced operational forms and management methods prevailing 
in the capitalist countries as they reflect the general laws 
governing modern socialized production and the commodity 
economy, and taking as reference some economic policies and 
legislation in the capitalist countries that reflect objective 
economic laws. Being limited by the space, this article will 
only talk about how Shenzhen has used the effective capitalist 
practice in pursuing the market economy to serve the purpose of 
establishing the socialist market economy. 
  Over the past several hundred years of capitalist 
development, a whole set of market organizational forms, 
operational mechanisms, and "game" rules have taken form. They 
represent the achievements of human civilization. Shenzhen 
boldly adopted and creatively applied them according to the 
needs of economic structural reform. For example, in the area of 
reforming the enterprise management system through running three 
types of foreign-funded enterprises, Shenzhen creatively adopted 
and applied the operational mechanism and management experience 
of Western enterprises, trained a large number of managerial 
personnel, and enhanced the level of enterprise management. The 
joint stock system that was adopted by enterprises in Shenzhen 
was also first developed in the West. By learning from the 
Western experience in developing joint stock companies, Shenzhen 
took the lead in China in transforming the state-owned 
enterprises according to the joint stock corporate system. 
Practice has shown that the joint stock system is not 
exclusively applicable to capitalism; rather, it is also an 
effective form of transforming our enterprise operation 
mechanism. Shenzhen also adopted the Western practice of 
handling enterprise mergers and bankruptcies, and thus 
established the enterprise property rights transfer system and 
the enterprise bankruptcy system. This promoted the flow of 
production factors to enterprises that achieve good economic 
results and increased effective supply in society. In the area 
of organizing and building markets, Shenzhen boldly adopted the 
Western countries practice of distributing resources through the 
market and commercializing the factors of production and took 
the lead in the whole country in establishing the labor and real 
estate markets. Land was transferred on a paid basis or was 
openly put up for auction. Shenzhen also adopted Western 
marketing methods, used Western market channels and sales 
networks, adopted international market regulatory mechanisms, 
and sold large quantities of products to the international 
market. In the area of economic control, Shenzhen also adopted 
the economic management methods of Hong Kong, Singapore, and 
other capitalist countries and regions. The original government 
departments responsible for managing various trades were 
transformed into enterprises, and a series of trade associations 
were set up to play a coordinating and intermediary role. The 
government of the special economic zone formulated a series of 
local laws and regulations with reference to the legal system in 
Hong Kong and other places and according to international 
practice, thus ensuring the orderly operation of the market 
mechanism under the control of the "game rules." It can be said 
that a major reason why Shenzhen could rapidly and smoothly move 
onto the path of the socialist market economy was that it dared 
and was good at adopting and absorbing the effective capitalist 
practices in developing the market economy. 
  When using the useful achievements of capitalism, Shenzhen 
adhered to the principle of "mainly applying elements to serve 
our own purposes," always proceeded from the realities, 
selectively adopted and introduced those elements that were 
useful according to our own needs, and creatively applied these 
elements. Practice has shown that, as long as we have adhered to 
this principle, we would be able to correctly use the 
civilization achievements created by capitalist society in order 
to promote the development of the productive forces in socialist 
society. 
<H3>  Fourth, Constantly "Using Both Hands to Grasp" the Work, and 
Actively Exploring the New Way To Develop Spiritual Civilization 
Under the Conditions of the Market Economy </H3>
  Comrade Xiaoping's instruction that the special economic 
zones are special "economic" zones rather than special 
"political" zones determines that the special economic zones 
must maintain the party's leadership and adhere to the socialist 
road. Therefore, in the course of building the special economic 
zones, we must always pay attention to properly handling the 
relationship between persisting in reform and opening and 
adhering to the four cardinal principles and must use both hands 
to grasp the work. Comrade Xiaoping said: "In the early 1980's, 
when establishing the special economic zones, I told the leading 
comrades in Guangdong that we should use both hands to grasp our 
work. That is, one hand should be used to grasp reform and 
opening, and the other hand should be used to severely crack 
down on economic crimes and to handle the ideological and 
political work. This is the two-point outlook [liang dian lun 
0357 7820 6158]. During his inspection tour to the south, he 
once again stressed: "Guangdong should catch up with the `four 
little dragons' in Asia. Not only should it boost the economy, 
but its public order and public conduct should also be improved. 
It should catch up with them in the construction of both 
civilizations, and only this can be called socialism with 
Chinese characteristics." 
  Will Shenzhen be able to maintain the socialist spirit while 
carrying out reform, effecting opening, and making rapid 
economic development? This is an important question about which 
many people are concerned. We should say that such concern is 
not uncalled-for. Shenzhen is effecting a high degree of opening 
and is also adjacent to Hong Kong. It is situated at the 
marginal point of the two social systems and is undergoing 
changes brought about by the rapid pace of reform and the 
comparatively developed commodity economy. All these special 
conditions have indeed brought many new contradictions and 
problems to the construction of spiritual civilization. The 
party committee of the special economic zone was always soberly 
aware of this and attached great importance to strengthening the 
construction of socialist spiritual civilization while advancing 
reform, opening, and economic development. At the same time, it 
also actively explored the new way to build spiritual 
civilization while dealing with new issues under the new 
conditions of reform, opening, and the market economy. 
  While building spiritual civilization, the special economic 
zone mainly gave guidance to people's values and enhanced 
people's quality in order to cultivate people with a lofty 
ideal, with moral integrity, with good education, and with a 
strong sense of discipline. The measures in this regard were 
rather concrete and effective. For example, the activities of 
"being good citizens and advanced units, and making Shenzhen a 
civilized city" were carried out consistently over a long time 
to promote Shenzhen's spirit of "pioneering, creation, unity, 
and dedication." Advanced individuals and institutions were 
elected regularly in the whole city on a large scale. Such 
activities played a positive role in giving value guidance to 
the people in Shenzhen. The party committee of the city also 
dialectically analyzed and treated the changes and influence 
brought by the commodity economy on the people's mentality. For 
example, the concepts of equality, competition, and efficiency 
are positive and progressive and should be promoted. Comrade 
Xiaoping also affirmed the slogan that "time is money; 
efficiency is life," which first appeared in Shekou. This idea 
has now taken root in the people's minds. On the other hand, 
Shenzhen was also soberly aware of the negative impact of the 
commodity economy on the people's thinking and mentality and 
effectively resisted money fetishism. In this regard, opinion 
media played a positive guiding role. Shenzhen also made great 
efforts to develop the cultural, educational, sports, and public 
health undertakings. In the 11 years between 1980 and 1991, 
Shenzhen's investment in educational undertakings accounted for 
15.7 percent of the city's total expenditure. At present, there 
are all types of large and modern cultural, education, 
scientific and technological, sports facilities in Shenzhen. 
This is a major achievement which makes the people in Shenzhen 
proud. 
  Another important measure for building spiritual 
civilization 
in Shenzhen was to seriously carry out anticorruption struggle 
among cadres and party members, and always take anticorruption 
as a major task in ideological and organizational building. 
Shenzhen successively adopted a series of regulations and rules 
and adopted anticorruption measures such as the "two openings 
and one supervision." It took the lead in the whole country in 
setting up the administrative supervision bureau and the 
complaint centers against economic crimes in order to intensify 
management and supervision over party and government cadres. At 
the same time, it strengthened the comprehensive control over 
public security,and severely cracked down on various economic 
crimes and other crimes. All this played an important role in 
maintaining good public order and public conduct in the special 
economic zone. Practice shows that, as long as we use both 
hands to grasp the work, the special economic zone will 
certainly be able to maintain the socialist spirit and 
simultaneously develop both material and spiritual civilization 
while making rapid economic development.

  [Excerpts] When visiting grass-roots level financial and 
taxation personnel in Guiyang yesterday, Chen Shineng, 
provincial party secretary and governor, stressed: All levels 
of financial and taxation departments should carefully organize 
the implementation of the new taxation system. Not only should 
the income index be assessed, but a full set of reform and the 
establishment of a new mechanism and structure should also be 
taken into account. 
  In Guiyang yesterday Chen Shineng and his entourage visited 
the cadres and staff members of the Weixing Financial Office, 
the Toutiao Taxation Office, the Jinhua Taxation Office, and the 
Zhongnan Financial and Taxation Office. He expressed his Lunar 
New Year greetings to them and all financial and taxation staff 
members in the province on behalf of the provincial party 
committee and government. 
  After listening to a feedback report by the Weixing 
Financial 
Office, Chen Shineng said: In the major reform projects to be 
carried out in the province this year, financial reform will be 
given top priority, and its success or failure will have a 
direct bearing on the entire reform. Because there is no 
ready-made experience to go by, we will carefully proceed with 
financial reform according to Marxist-Leninist methods and 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, keeping in mind Guizhou's specific 
conditions. We should not merely consider increasing indices in 
task fulfillment, but we should also formulate practical and 
coordinated measures and policies and should establish a new 
financial and taxation mechanism and structure. [passage omitted] 
  Chen Shineng pointed out: In the course of deepening 
financial and taxation reform, financial and taxation 
departments in all localities should consider new situations and 
new problems. In particular, they should consider and resolve 
prominent problems during the replacement of the old structure 
by the new. In the meantime, we should do a good job in 
promoting the economy at the county level. 
  In the Toutiao Taxation Office, which has won the 
designation 
of a nationally renowned taxation office, Chen Shineng wrote an 
inscription, which reads: Learn From This Nationally Renowned 
Taxation Office. In the Jinhua Taxation Office, which has been 
cited as an advanced collective by the State Taxation Bureau, 
Governor Chen Shineng explicitly indicated the need for all 
financial and taxation departments in the province to learn from 
the Jinhua Taxation Office in increasing revenue and improving 
their mental attitude and professional quality. Chen Shineng 
also took a group photograph with some financial and taxation 
personnel.

<F P=106> [Report: "Chairman Bai Lichen Delivers Important Speech at </F>
Opening Session of Regional Economic Work Conference"] 
  [Text] The regional economic work conference opened on the 
morning of 26 January 1994. This is an important meeting in the 
process of reform, opening, and economic development in this 
region. 
  The tasks of the conference are to: Comprehensively 
implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee and the national economic work conference; 
analyze the current economic situation; arrange this year's 
economic work; and mobilize cadres and the masses in Ningxia to 
further emancipate their minds, unify their thinking, grasp the 
opportunity, quicken reform and development, and create a new 
situation in the economic work of this region. 
  Party and government leaders of the autonomous region Huang 
Huang, Bai Lichen [chairman of the regional government], Ma 
Qizhi, Ma Xiguang, Wang Yu, Ma Wenxue, and Liu Zhong attended 
the meeting. Wang Qixing, vice chairman of the autonomous region 
government, presided over the opening session. Responsible 
comrades from all prefectural, city, and county governments and 
departments in charge of economic work; leaders of all relevant 
regional departments; representatives of large and medium 
industrial enterprises in Ningxia; and responsible comrades from 
the democratic parties, totalling over 300 people, attended the 
meeting. 
  At the opening session, Bai Lichen, chairman of the regional 
government, delivered an important speech entitled: "Deepening 
Reform, Adjusting Thoughts, Grasping the Opportunity, and 
Accelerating Development." The speech was divided into five 
major parts. While analyzing the current economic situation, 
Bai Lichen pointed out: In 1993, we comprehensively implemented 
the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and continued to 
carry out the instructions Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave on his 
inspection tour to the south; we also made positive explorations 
regarding the establishment of the socialist market economy and 
made major progress in this region's economic and social 
development. On the basis of the economic recovery [hui sheng 
0932 0581] in 1992, economic growth moved onto a faster lane 
last year and the GDP for the whole year reached 9.5 billion 
yuan, an increase of 10 percent over the previous year and 
exceeding the target of 9 percent. The output value of primary 
industry increased by 4.5 percent; that of secondary industry 
increased by 13.2 percent; and that of the tertiary industry 
increased by 9.2 percent. Local financial revenue reached 1.08 
billion yuan, increasing by 40.6 percent over the previous year. 
When affirming that the region's economy was developing 
healthily and stably, Bai Lichen also analyzed the existing 
difficulties and problems in the course of economic development: 
People's thinking was still not completely free from the 
shackles of the old concepts and systems and was still not 
commensurate with the requirements of the new situation; the 
pace of reform was not quick enough and some deep problems in 
economic life have not been thoroughly solved; a considerable 
number of state- owned enterprises have not effectively 
transformed their management mechanisms and continue to incur 
serious business losses due to poor management and poor economic 
efficiency; and no marked results were achieved in handling the 
"bottleneck" problems which constrained economic growth with 
some becoming even more serious. 
  This year, reform in the whole country will make advances 
across the board and breakthroughs will be made in some key 
areas; economic construction will enter a new development period 
as the process of establishing the socialist market economic 
structure will be quickened; and this region will also grasp the 
opportunity to advance reforms and accelerate development. In 
his speech, Bai Lichen said: According to the "Decision" 
adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and the spirit of the national economic work 
conference, the guideline for this year's economic work in 
Ningxia is: Follow the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory about building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
profoundly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee and the national economic work 
conference, further emancipate our minds, advance reforms across 
the board, expand opening to the outside world, adjust the 
structure in an intensive way, enhance the economic efficiency, 
take firms steps to build the basic framework of the socialist 
market economic structure, and promote the sustained, rapid, and 
healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] 
development of the region's economy. 
  The second part of Bai Lichen's speech called for deepening 
understanding, emancipating the minds, and boosting morale to 
meet the new opportunities and challenges. When analyzing the 
favorable and unfavorable impact of the international and 
domestic situations on this region's reform and development, he 
pointed out seriously that, apart from being constrained by 
certain objective conditions, people still lack the sense of 
market and have not yet emancipated their minds thoroughly. 
They are still affected by the traditional concepts of the 
planned economy over a long period of time, so they are slow to 
react under the new situation and lack a sense of crisis and 
urgency. This is a major obstacle to our current work. In 
order to accelerate development, such mental obstacles must be 
removed; otherwise, we shall not be able to make advances. Only 
through substantial emancipation of the minds can great 
developments be made in reform and economic construction. 
Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the concepts of reform and 
development, to increase the sense of competition and 
efficiency, and to adopt the concepts of self-strengthening, 
self-reliance, and self-development. It is also necessary to be 
fully aware of the favorable conditions, increase confidence, 
and boost morale. We must be bold in making advances and we 
must not hesitate and let opportunities slip. We cannot slow 
down reform because we are afraid of difficulties and continue 
to wait; cannot slow down development by holding a negative 
attitude of complaining about the difficulties; and we cannot 
see the widening of the gap between this region and other 
localities by having a parochial and complacent attitude. 
  In the third part of his speech, Bai Lichen called for 
intensifying reforms, advancing reforms across the board, making 
breakthroughs in key areas, and quickening the pace of 
establishing the socialist market economic structure. He said: 
This year will witness the adoption of more reform measures 
than in the past 10 years and more and the breadth, depth, 
difficulty, and intensity of reform will all be unprecedented. 
Our main reform task is to further deepen the enterprise reform 
and more rapidly establish the modern enterprise system. This 
is a key point and also a difficult point in the economic 
structural reform of this region. We must take major actions 
and adopt decisive measures to strive for major breakthroughs. 
We shall conscientiously reform the financial and taxation 
system, steadily advance the banking reform, quicken the reform 
of the investment system, deepen the reform of the foreign trade 
system, more quickly establish the social guarantee system, and 
further advance the price reform. Bai Lichen stressed: When 
advancing reforms in all fields, it is necessary to properly 
handle the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability. We must effectively advance reforms while keeping 
stability, and, in turn, promote social stability through 
deepening reform and accelerating development. 
  The reforms for the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure will inevitably produce a major impact on 
economic development in this region. Therefore, in the fourth 
part of his speech, Bai Lichen said that we should act 
positively in compliance with the reform trend, increase the 
intensity of adjustments according to the actual conditions of 
this region, sort out our ideas and plans, fix a clear and 
correct orientation, and effectively shift the economic work to 
the path of being focused on the enhancement of economic 
efficiency. First, we should renew our understanding of the 
conditions of this region, adjust the investment structure, and 
use the limited financial resources on the projects which will 
yield the best returns. Second, we should constantly take 
enhancement of economic efficiency as the central link in our 
economic work and give top priority to optimizing the structure, 
strengthening management, and enhancing efficiency. Third, 
foreign trade should produce effects in nurturing production 
development so that the Ningxia economy can be linked with the 
international market. Fourth, new economic growth points should 
be fostered and the individual and private economies and the 
township and town enterprises should be developed greatly. 
Fifth, great efforts should be made to foster and develop the 
market system and to raise the market-oriented proportion of the 
economy. 
  In the fifth part of his speech, Bai Lichen required 
governments and departments at all levels to transform their 
functions more intensively and improve their style of work more 
effectively, thus guaranteeing the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the economy. In this regard, Bai Lichen stressed 
three major points: First, it is necessary to quicken the 
administrative structure reform of the governments in the course 
of functional transformation. Government functions must be 
separated from enterprise management and the administrative 
structure should be streamlined and unified so that higher work 
efficiency can be achieved. Through reform, we will establish a 
new administrative structure which is suited to the requirements 
of the socialist market economy and functions flexibly and 
efficiently. Second, it is necessary to change the style of 
work effectively and strive to improve the work quality. Local 
governments and departments at all levels should overcome 
seriously the superficial style of saying more than doing, 
issuing general calls rather than giving concrete guidance, and 
they should resolutely overcome the bureaucratic and formalistic 
style in their administrative work. Leaders at all levels 
should spend more time on making in-depth investigations and 
studies in grass-roots units and among the masses and should pay 
more attention to settling concrete problems in the work. It is 
necessary to make qualitative and quantitative analyses, find 
out the position of their own departments in the whole country 
and find out their shortcomings, work out feasible measures, and 
adopt the target responsibility system. It is also necessary to 
bear in mind the overall interests and properly handle the 
relationship between the overall interests and the local or 
departmental interests, thus ensuring the smooth implementation 
of all reform measures. Third, it is necessary to use both 
hands to grasp the work and to keep both hands tough. At 
present, it is necessary to use the theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics to educate cadres and the masses; 
form the consensus of understanding, supporting, and 
participating in reform in the whole society; and actually turn 
the reform measures into the conscious actions of the masses. 
While concentrating on reform, opening, and economic 
construction, it is also necessary to attach importance to 
education, science and technology, culture, public health, 
family planning, and the work in other fields. 
  Finally, Bai Lichen said: We are now in a crucial historical 
period and are facing arduous reform and development tasks. 
Doing the economic work well this year is of great significance 
for Ningxia's future development. As long as we further 
emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, maintain unity, 
boldly break new ground, and handle our work in all fields in a 
down-to-earth manner, then we shall certainly be able to fulfill 
all tasks; effect the sustained, rapid, and healthy development 
of the economy in this region; and take new steps in the course 
of establishing the socialist market economic structure.

Municipal CPC Committee, at the 25 December municipal forum to 
mark the centenary of the birth of Mao Zedong: "Study Mao Zedong 
Thought, and Persist in Dialectical Materialism"] 
  [Text] Comrades! 
  December 26 of this year marks the centenary of the birth of 
Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people of various 
nationalities throughout the country and the founder of the CPC, 
the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the PRC. 
  During the days when the entire party and the people 
throughout the country ceremoniously commemorate the centenary 
of the birth of Mao Zedong with great respect, the vast number 
of party members, cadres, and the masses of Beijing 
Municipality, like the people in other areas of the country, 
cherish the deep memory and particularly warm feeling toward 
Comrade Mao Zedong. As early as the 4 May Movement, Comrade Mao 
Zedong came to Beijing twice to explore the truth of revolution 
and the road to the liberation of the Chinese nation and, 
enlightened by Marxism-Leninism, became a firm communist. On 
the eve of the national victory in the Chinese revolution, Mao 
Zedong and his comrades-in-arms devised strategies in Beijing 
and commanded the great army of a million people to cross Chang 
Jiang, occupy Nanjing, and put an end to the reactionary rule of 
the Kuomintang. On 1 October 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong 
personally raised the first five-star red flag of the new China 
on the rostrum of Tiananmen and solemnly declared to the world 
that Chinese people were standing. After the founding of the 
country, Comrade Mao Zedong lived and worked in Beijing all the 
time. In the process of leading China's socialist revolution 
and construction, he was always concerned with the people and 
the various works of the capital. He left footmarks in many 
places and gave instructions to many people. This is what the 
people of Beijing Municipality will not forget. The purpose for 
the Beijing municipal party committee, people's congress 
standing committee, government, and committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference and the Beijing 
Garrison in holding this forum marking the centenary of the 
birth of Comrade Mao Zedong today is to review Comrade Mao 
Zedong's great achievements, further study Mao Zedong Thought, 
always hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and 
advance bravely; and to pursue the road to socialism with 
Chinese characteristics that was pioneered by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, persist in reform, open wider to the outside world, 
and express our deep memory of Comrade Mao Zedong with 
outstanding results in various work. 
<H6>  1. </H6>
  Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great 
proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theorist. His 
greatest historical achievement was to integrate the fundamental 
tenets of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of Chinese 
revolution, lead our party and people to find a correct road for 
new democratic revolution, fulfill the task of opposing 
imperialism and feudalism, and put an end to the Chinese history 
of semi-colonial and semi- feudal society; and to eliminate the 
exploiting class and the system of exploitation and establish a 
brand-new socialist system. Proceeding from China's reality, he 
then began to explore the road of building socialism. Based on 
the fundamental tenets of Marxism-Leninism and with Comrade Mao 
Zedong as the major representative, the Chinese communists came 
up with a theoretical summary of the series of original 
experiences in China's long practice of revolution and 
construction to form a scientific guiding thought compatible 
with China's conditions which we refer to as Mao Zedong Thought. 
  Mao Zedong Thought is extensive and profound. It has 
enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism with its original theory 
in the fields of philosophy, political economy, scientific 
socialism, military science, culture and art, and party 
building. It is the treasure-house of the theory of our party 
and the spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation and is the 
constant guide to our building of a modern socialist country. 
  In the practice of leading the revolution and construction 
of 
China, Comrade Mao Zedong attached high importance to the great 
role of ideological theory. He demanded that we arm the whole 
party with Marxism-Leninism, regard the adherence to Marxist 
dialectical materialism as a conspicuous part of the party's 
building of ideological theory, and wage an unremitting struggle 
against idealism and metaphysics that deviate from dialectical 
materialism. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong made many profound and brilliant 
expositions on the extremely great significance in studying and 
grasping Marxism-Leninism. He highly praised the following 
remarks of Lenin: "Without the theory of revolution, there would 
be no revolution movement." Comrade Mao Zedong maintained: 
Without the theory of revolution, it is impossible to achieve 
success in guiding a great political party of revolutionary 
movement. He pointed out: The salvos of the October Revolution 
brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped 
advanced elements of the whole world and of China to use the 
proletarian world outlook, that was regarded as the instrument 
to observe the destiny of our country, to reconsider the issues 
of their own." Chinese Communists, represented by Comrade Mao 
Zedong, found the proletarian world outlook, a sharp weapon we 
used to observe the issues of China, initiated the 
Chinese-oriented Marxism-Leninism--Mao Zedong Thought, and 
guided the whole party and all the people in the country to win 
a victory in the new democratic revolution. Right after the 
founding of the PRC, he again explicitly pointed out: "The 
theoretical foundation that guides our ideology is 
Marxism-Leninism." The Chinese Communists were able to make 
difficult and tortuous explorations in the revolution and 
construction of China and in the march from victory to victory 
precisely because they were armed with Marxism- Leninism-Mao 
Zedong Thought. 
  In studying Marxism-Leninism, what should be studied first? 
Comrade Mao Zedong maintained: What is most important is to 
grasp -- dialectical materialism and historical materialism, the 
essential components of Marxist philosophy. He repeatedly 
admonished the whole party: "Marxism-Leninism is science" and 
truth. The founding of Marxism-Leninism is an unprecedented big 
revolution in the history of mankind's understanding. Marxists 
and Communists "have applied materialist dialectics to many 
fields of the analysis of mankind history and the analysis of 
natural history and to many fields of the change in society and 
the change in nature, thus obtaining extremely great success." 
Comrade Mao Zedong called on the whole party to conscientiously 
grasp the proletarian world outlook and methodology of 
dialectical materialism and historical materialism, in 
approaching, analyzing, and solving the practical problems of 
China by studying the fundamental theory of Marxism-Leninism. 
Comrade Mao Zedong himself set a glorious example for us with 
his immortal philosophic works, such as "On Practice," "On 
Contradiction," and "Whence the People's Correct Ideas?," will 
radiate with the light of truth forever. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong constantly stressed that the key to 
studying Marxism and Leninism is to be well acquainted with 
their stands, viewpoints and methods, and oppose subjectivism, 
dogmatism, idealism and metaphysics. In the study of Marxism 
and Leninism, if we fail to exert efforts to grasp their stands, 
viewpoints and methods, and understand only some phrases, we 
will surely fall into idealism and metaphysics; if we use them 
to guide our work, we will surely commit subjective and dogmatic 
mistakes. Comrade Mao Zedong firmly defended the Marxist 
dialectical materialism. He pointed out explicitly and 
profoundly that Marxism is a "theory which can be used as a 
criterion all over the world," that we should not treat it as a 
dogma but a guide to action, and that we should not "only study 
some phrases and sentences of Marxism and Leninism but study it 
as a science of revolution." Mao Zedong believed that 
subjectivism, dogmatism, and empiricism was all ideology and 
metaphysics, and that they all have the "characteristics of 
dividing subjectivism and objectivism and disconnecting 
recognition and practice." The ideology of bourgeois 
liberalization that negates the four cardinal principles emerged 
in the course of reform and opening up, while "leftist" ideology 
that negates reform and opening up has not conformed to reality 
and the national conditions of our country. As far as the source 
of the theory of knowledge is concerned, it also separates 
subjectivism from objectivism and disconnects theory from 
practice. Therefore, only by grasping the stands, viewpoints 
and methods of Marxism and Leninism well can we be able to 
uphold a correct viewpoint, correctly sum up experience, 
overcome difficulties, make less mistakes and do more work. 
  Why should we study and grasp Marxism and Leninism ? It is 
because we want to apply them to solving practical problems. 
Comrade Mao Zedong stressed: " We should purposefully study 
Marxist and Leninist theories," "have a definite object in 
view," and "use the arrow of Marxism and Leninism to shoot the 
target of the revolution of China." He particularly criticized 
the aimless attitude of studying the stands, viewpoints and 
methods of Marxism and Leninism not for the purpose of solving 
the theoretical and strategic issues of the revolution of China 
but "to simply study theories," and strictly criticized the bad 
study work style of merely taking the "arrow" of Marxism and 
Leninism "in the hand, praising it repeatedly, saying that it is 
a `good arrow,' but not wanting to shoot it out." He pointed 
out sharply that if we fail to clarify and solve this issue 
well, "our party's theoretical level will never be raised and 
China will never win a victory in its revolution." 
  Comrade Mao Zedong always upheld the viewpoint of attaching 
prime importance to the practice of dialectical materialist 
theory, constantly undertaken investigations and studies, and 
stressed that while correct ideology and understanding can only 
come from practice, they must be tested by practice. He 
believed that the "correct ideology of man can only comes from 
social practice," and that "a correct understanding can be 
formed through repetition, such as turning material 
understanding to spiritual understanding and spiritual 
understanding to material understanding; in other words, 
practice into understanding, and understanding into practice." 
We should test and develop truth in the course of practice. He 
held that our party's correct and unshakable tactics could never 
be formulated by a small number of people who stayed at home to 
"cudgel their brains to `think of ways' and `make decisions'" 
"based on their subjective desires," and that we should "learn 
about social conditions and conduct realistic investigations 
often." Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong advocated within the 
party the need to vigorously conduct investigation and study. 
"No investigation, no right to speak," "No correct 
investigation, no right to speak, either" were his famous 
maxims. It was our efforts to uphold and carry forward the 
party's fine tradition of investigation and study and to adhere 
to Comrade Mao Zedong's line of dialectical materialist theory 
of knowledge -- "practice-knowledge-again practice-again 
knowledge -- that enabled our understanding to be improved to a 
new height following developments in practice and enabled the 
cause of our party and people to advance in the practice of 
continuous exploration. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong advocated the need to extensively launch 
an education movement to study Marxism-Leninism in the entire 
party and among the people throughout the country. He 
maintained that everyone should study some philosophy. Soon 
after the war of resistance against Japan, he called on the 
entire party to launch an emulation in studying Marxism-Leninism 
to "see who has truly learned something, learned more, and 
learned better." In 1942, he personally led the Yanan 
rectification movement and launched an extensive 
Marxism-Leninism education movement for studying dialectical 
materialism, historical materialism, and Comrade Mao Zedong's 
basic works on the rectification movement, such as "Transform 
Our Study," "Rectify the Party's Work Styles," and "Oppose 
Stereotyped Party Writing," thus liberating the vast number of 
party members from the mental shackles of dogmatism, empiricism, 
and, especially, Wang Ming dogmatism and then enabling the 
entire party to achieve unprecedented unity and further maturity 
and ensuring the victory of the war of resistance against Japan 
and success in the new democratic revolution in the country. 
After the founding of new China, he again issued calls on many 
occasions for extensively studying Marxism-Leninism and 
organizing "a powerful theoretical contingent in which millions 
of people study the theoretical foundation of Marxism, namely 
dialectical and historical materialism, and oppose various types 
of idealism and mechanical materialism." He called for 
"liberating philosophy from the classrooms and books of 
philosophers and turning it into a sharp weapon of the masses." 
This weapon, once mastered by the masses, will become a 
tremendous material force to transform society and the world. 
Thanks to Comrade Mao Zedong's advocacy and promotion, an 
atmosphere of attaching importance to theories and studying 
theories took shape in the party, which still benefits us a 
great deal. 
<H6>  2. </H6>
  The second-generation leadership collective of the party 
Central Committee with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core 
scientifically accomplished the important task of correctly 
appraising Comrade Mao Zedong and safeguarding the historical 
position of Mao Zedong Thought, a task concerning the future and 
destiny of the party and the state, and pooled the wisdom of the 
entire party and the people of the whole country with the 
tremendous political courage to blaze a new road of building 
socialism and the tremendous courage to pioneer a new realm of 
Marxist theory. It established, in a creative manner, the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This 
represented another, even greater historical leap after our 
party successfully found a road for new democratic revolution 
and established the socialist system. It unfolded before the 
entire party and the people of the whole country a magnificent 
prospect for a prosperous, democratic, civilized socialist 
modern country. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping inherited and developed Mao Zedong 
Thought, regarded adherence to and defence of Marxist- Leninist 
philosophy -- dialectical materialism and historical materialism 
-- as the most important and fundamental link, and used this 
philosophy to guide practice in China. He particularly paid 
attention to using the dialectical materialist theory of 
knowledge to guide the practice of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  Following the "Cultural Revolution," Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
upheld the Marxist materialism and brought order out of chaos in 
the field of knowledge with a great Marxist's boldness of 
vision. After the smashing of the "gang of four," he took the 
lead in resisting and criticizing the erroneous principle of 
"two whatever," and supported, guided, and promoted the 
nationwide discussion of regarding practice as the sole 
criterion for testing truth, thus breaking with the trammels of 
"leftist" ideas. He always maintained that "true Marxists and 
Leninists must understand, inherit, and develop Marxism-Leninism 
in accordance with the present situation." "Marxists refusing to 
use new ideas and viewpoints to inherit and develop Marxism are 
not true Marxists." In light of the confusion and misgivings 
among some comrades within the party, he repeatedly stressed the 
necessity of "completely and accurately understanding Mao Zedong 
Thought," and the necessity of "being good at studying, 
mastering, and applying the system of Mao Zedong Thought to 
guide all the work. This is the only way to prevent us from 
cutting apart and distorting Mao Zedong Thought and from 
damaging Mao Zedong Thought." This enabled the whole party to 
again go back to the correct Marxist line of knowledge and laid 
ideological and theoretical foundations for the convocation of 
the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, 
which is of great historical significance. 
  Another major contribution made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping to 
the party's ideological and theoretical building is the 
establishment of the ideological line of emancipating the mind 
and seeking truth from facts using Marxist dialectical 
materialism as the weapon. Comrade Deng Xiaoping proceeded from 
China's reality to form the theory of the initial stage of 
China's socialism to formulate the party's basic line of "one 
central task and two basic points," and to seek the road of 
developing the socialism with Chinese characteristics, precisely 
under the guidance of the Marxist line of knowledge, thus making 
China's socialist cause embark on a new period of vigorous 
development. Also, precisely under the guidance of the Marxist 
line of knowledge known as emancipating the mind and seeking 
truth from facts, Comrade Deng Xiaoping thoroughly overhauled 
the long-standing conclusion of plans being the essential 
characteristic of socialism and pointed out "that having more 
plans or more markets is not the essential difference between 
socialism and capitalism. While a planned economy is not 
tantamount to socialism and capitalism has plans; a market 
economy is not tantamount to capitalism, and socialism also has 
markets. Both of plans and markets are economic means." 
"Whatever is conducive to the development of productive forces 
can by utilized." The third plenary session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee adopted the "CPC Central Committee's decision 
on some issues of establishing a socialist market economic 
structure," in line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress. This is an extremely 
important contribution made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping to the 
treasure-house of the Marxist theory. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has specifically and flexibly applied 
the development view of dialectical materialism of 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to the reality of building 
socialist modernizations. His noted inference is that "only 
development represents an essential criterion". All things in 
the world are in the course of ceaseless movement, development, 
and changes. They never remain in a period or at a level 
forever, so does socialism as long as it has become a brand-new 
social system. In dealing with this issue in the past, we 
lacked the viewpoint of Marxist theory of dialectical 
materialism; somewhat had one-sidedness in understanding the 
socialist essence; did not stress "the emancipation of 
productive forces through reforms"; and did not totally master 
the meaning between "emancipating productive forces and 
developing them". All of these have enabled us to experience a 
tortuous path and to pay for them. By studying Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and particularly studying his viewpoint and 
thought relating to development, we have suddenly seen the light 
and upgraded our understanding on socialism to a new realm. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Poverty does not mean 
socialism and extremely slow development does not also." By 
being divorced from development, we cannot firmly grasp the 
upholding of socialist systems, direction, and road. "The most 
fundamental task in this regard is to develop productive forces. 
In the final analysis, the socialist superiority should give 
expression to productive force development being faster or 
higher than that of capitalism and to steadily improving the 
people's livelihood based on developing the productive force". 
Then, "efforts should be made to prepare a foundation for 
entering the age of Communism". "By not doing so will we never 
be able to develop productive forces, to do away with the 
egalitarianism and the practice of eating from the same big pot, 
to improve the people's livelihood, and to bring the people's 
enthusiasm into play". Thus, the socialist undertakings of 
modernizations will come to nothing. Comrade Deng Xiaoping also 
pointed out: "We should not block localities that are able to 
achieve development and localities whose conditions meet should 
engage in development as faster as possible. It is nothing for 
us to worry about as long as these localities stress economic 
results and quality and develop the export-oriented economy". 
Based on this development ideology, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has 
formulated for the entire party a set of strategies, principles, 
and policies for accelerating the socialist development. The 
entire party and the people throughout the country should arm 
themselves with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on development 
being an essential criterion and extremely play their enthusiasm 
and creativeness so as to promote the construction of socialism 
with Chinese characteristics to forge ahead and bring about 
changes day after day. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has applied the Marxist philosophical 
viewpoint of practice being the first to the practice of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and urged the 
entire party to dare to try, to pioneer, and to take risk in 
building socialism. Upholding practice being the first, 
respecting the objective law, bringing the subjective initiative 
into full play, and "daring to try and pioneer," truly represent 
the upholding of Marxist theory of dialectical materialism. 
Marx once said: "Philosophers only adopt different styles to 
explain the world, however, the issue in this regard lies in 
changing the world". Those who have just sat there to talk 
about theories, indulged in empty talks, and not dared to do 
this or that, do not know Marxism even slightly. Comrade Mao 
Zedong once pointed out: In fighting the revolutionary wars, 
"we have not learned them well in advance but we begin to study 
them after we have engaged in. Thus, fighting means learning." 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping also repeatedly emphasized that socialism 
is achieved through hard work. He said: Socialism with Chinese 
characteristics that we are developing has been "unheard of in 
China's several thousand years of history" and "an undertaking 
never developed in other socialist countries. Therefore, there 
is no ready experience to learn from. We can only learn in the 
process of work and explore in the process of practice." He 
urged us to "boldly experiment and blaze new trails regarding 
the endeavors whose worth we are certain" and never act slowly 
and overcautiously like women with bound feet. Otherwise, we 
"will be unable to blaze a good road or a new road and unable to 
pioneer a new cause." He repeatedly reminded people: "It is 
necessary to overcome fear and have courage. There must be 
someone to conduct the first experiment in any field. Only then 
can a new road be opened. We should be prepared for failure 
when conducting the first experiment. Failure is nothing 
serious." What is important is that we should have the ability 
to summarize experiences and "persist in what is right and 
rapidly correct what is wrong." This philosophical idea of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's has greatly encouraged and inspired our 
spirit and has extremely important guiding significance in 
accelerating China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that in studying Marxist 
theory, we should achieve proficiency, find use for, become 
familiar with, and master the fundamental tenets. The classical 
works of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought are as vast as the 
open sea. In studying them, we should adhere to the principle 
of studying less more proficiently, and make them useful. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping earnestly said to new and old cadres on 
many occasions: "Time and tasks are different for our current 
endeavor to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, and 
there is indeed plenty of new knowledge to study. This requires 
that we master the basic theory of Marxism to comply with the 
new reality because only then can we improve our skills to use 
basic principles and basic methods to actively explore ways to 
resolve basic political, economic, social, and cultural issues." 
We should "familiarize ourselves with the basic theory of 
Marxism to acquire a stronger sense of adherence to principles 
in work, a systematic approach, foresight, and creativity." He 
particularly pointed out: "The several hundred members of the 
party Central Committee and the several thousand central and 
local high- ranking cadres should take the lead in assiduously 
studying modernized economic construction." Standing at the 
crest of the tide of this era, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is not only 
a brilliant example for the entire party in emancipating the 
mind and conducting exploration bravely but also a brilliant 
example in the creative application of the fundamental tenets of 
Marxism-Leninism. 
  Thanks to his mastery of the historical law governing social 
development with Marxist historical materialism, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping is confident in the success of Marxism and communism. 
In view of the abrupt changes in East Europe, the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, the serious setbacks and low 
tide of socialism in some countries, and some people's doubts 
and waverings about Marxism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping showed great 
foresight to point out: "I firmly believe that people who 
approve of Marxism will increase in the world because Marxism is 
a science, which uses historical materialism to bring to light 
the law governing the development of human society." This fully 
shows Comrade Deng Xiaoping's adherence to truth, loyalty to 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and firm faith in working 
hard all his life for the communist cause. 
  Comrades! When we commemorate the centenary of the birth 
of Comrade Mao Zedong, the most fundamental task is to uphold 
the theoretical foundation of the Marxist dialectical 
materialism, arm the whole party with Marxism-Leninism-Mao 
Zedong Thought and with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, actually 
strengthen the building of the party's ideology and theory, and 
guide and promote the sustained, rapid, and sound development of 
the capital's reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  First, we should profoundly study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping in close combination 
with realities. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping has collected Comrade Deng Xiaoping's most 
important and most creative works written in the process of 
forming and developing the theory of building the socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, thus being a scientific guide to our 
continuous advance. The central authorities have already 
adopted the decision of studying Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping. We should carry forward the style 
of study of integrating theory with practice, that was initiated 
by Comrade Mao Zedong. In studying this book, we should have a 
good command of focal points, study and read original works in 
deptb, and profoundly comprehend the essence of guidelines. In 
close combination with the realities of work and ideology, we 
should conscientiously summarize the experiences gained from the 
practice of reform, opening up, and economic construction over 
the past dozen of years, further clarify all sorts of confused 
understandings of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and strive to master the theory of building the 
socialism with Chinese characteristics in an all-round and 
specific manner rather than in a fragmentary and empty manner in 
order to continuously push forward the cause of reform, opening 
up, and economic construction. 
  Second, we should persistently implement the knowledge line 
of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, 
continuously renew our concepts, continuously break with the 
trammels of idealism and metaphysics, and strive to avoid 
subjective one-sidedness. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: 
"Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts are the 
quintessence of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and are the magic weapon to ensure that our 
party will be vigorous and vivid forever." By emancipating the 
mind, we mean extricating the people's ideas from the yoke of 
idealism and metaphysics; making ideas conform to practice and 
subjective things conform to objective ones; and persisting in 
dialectical materialism and seeking truth from facts. 
Emancipating the mind precisely means seeking truth from facts. 
On no account should we separate the emancipation of the mind 
from the seeking of truth, still less set any of them against 
the other. In recent years, we have launched mass discussions 
on emancipating the mind on four occasions in succession 
throughout the municipality, and every mass discussion has 
brought us a new leap in ideology and understanding and brought 
big enhancement to all items of work. It should be noted that 
the objective world undergoes constant change, and the ideas and 
concepts that reflect the objective world are also undergoing 
constant change. There is no end to the emancipation of the 
mind as a process of continuously deepening the understanding of 
the objective world. If we do not understand this point and pay 
no attention it, our ideas will become stagnant, rigid, and fall 
into subjective one-sidedness. At present, we should emancipate 
our minds to focus on the endeavors to accelerate the 
establishment of the socialist market economy system, to extend 
the degree of reform in establishing the modern enterprise 
system, to seize the opportunity to accelerate development and 
promote the economy of the capital to a new height every few 
years, and on the long-standing difficulties and hot issues that 
have prevented various departments and units from advance and 
the fear of difficulty resulting from this. Rapid construction 
of the capital and comprehensive progress in all sectors of 
society can be achieved only when we continuously emancipate our 
minds, eliminate ideological obstacles, free ourselves form the 
fetters of subjectivism and metaphysics, seek truth from facts, 
and proceed from reality in doing everything. 
  Third, we should continue to vigorously develop the trend of 
investigation and study to put our policy decisions on a more 
scientific and reliable base. "No investigation, no right to 
speak." As far as the leaders of a locality or a department are 
concerned, no right to speak means no right to make decisions. 
Leading organs and leading persons who cannot make decisions, in 
reality, have no right to leadership although they assume 
leading posts. The investigation and study activities 
extensively conducted throughout the municipality since the 
beginning of this year have not only helped cadres enhance their 
understanding of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics but also built a bridge to integrate theory with 
practice. Through investigations and study, many leading cadres 
have achieved a good command of knowledge, namely emancipating 
the mind and seeking truth from facts, and learned to use the 
Marxist stand, viewpoints, and methods to analyze and summarize 
the new problems and new experiences in reform, opening up, and 
economic construction. Many new ideas, new measures, 
large-scale moves, and creations compatible with their 
respective localities and departments have been put forward, and 
the work of their units have also taken on a new look. The 
vigorous trend of investigation and study has had a good 
beginning in the municipality. The municipal party committee 
has conducted investigation and study four times this year. 
Next year, it should set forth topics for investigation and 
study, include it in its plans, assign persons to be responsible 
for it, and conduct it four times. The good tradition of 
investigation and study must persist on a long-term basis. 
  Fourth, we should make continuous efforts to resolve the 
issues on world outlook and the outlook on life and truly join 
the party ideologically. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "A 
change in world outlook is a fundamental change." Only when we 
master the scientific, dialectical materialist, and historical 
materialist world outlook, can we embrace a firm communist 
outlook on life, truly join the party ideologically, never be 
subdued by force or shaken by poverty, be impervious to the 
temptation of wealth and high position, and never shake our 
communist faith under any circumstances. Many revolutionary 
martyrs did not yield or bend their will even when faced with 
the knife of the enemy. Today, as long as we embrace a firm 
communist world outlook and outlook on life, the plot of western 
hostile forces to effect our peaceful evolution will never 
succeed. Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and other old 
proletarian revolutionaries firmly embraced the communist world 
outlook, the communist faith, noble moral character, and the 
spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, thus becoming 
models for our times. Comrade Mao Zedong always stressed: "At 
any time and any place, communists should not put their personal 
interests at the fore, but should subjugate their personal 
interests beneath the interests of the Chinese nation and the 
people." He sharply criticized: "Selfishness, slackness in 
work, corruption and embezzlement, and the practice of being 
fond of the limelight are most contemptible." Those who indulge 
in such practices "do not understand at all what the proletarian 
idea is, what communism is, and what the party is." Under the 
new situation of developing the socialist market economy, we 
should guide the vast numbers of party members, leading cadres 
of the party in particular, to firmly embrace the communist 
world outlook and the communist outlook on life, to consciously 
resist and overcome the inroads of corrosive capitalist and 
feudal ideas, to consciously resist the influence from money 
worship, extreme individualism, and corrosive style of life, to 
honestly perform official duties, and to work diligently for the 
people so that they can truly become "noble persons," "pure 
persons," "persons absolved of bad taste," "persons conducive to 
the masses," and "persons with lofty ideals, moral integrity, 
cultural accomplishments, and a sense of discipline, so that 
they can struggle for the communist cause all their lives. If 
we pay no attention to remolding the outlook on the world and on 
life, we will eventually be eliminated by the times, and will 
certainly witness the situation pointed out by Comrade Mao 
Zedong in which some persons always think: "What on earth are 
proletarian ideas, and isn't it the same old stuff? How can 
they know that it is not easy to obtain it." These persons will 
"have lack communist flavor all their lives, and thus they 
cannot but deviate from the party." 
  Fifth, we must closely combine the building of ideology and 
theory with the implementation of the party's political line. 
The party's basic line of "one central task and two basic 
points" was formulated under the guidance of the ideological 
line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts and 
by proceeding from the basic conditions of our country. 
Therefore, this line has manifested the fundamental interests 
of the people throughout the country, is in keeping with the 
realities, and is scientific, correct, and unchanging for a long 
time. Only by understanding the scientific nature and 
correctness of this line in ideology and theory, can we even 
more consciously persist in the party's basic line without 
deviation for a hundred of years in line with the demands set by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping. We should educate the vast numbers of 
party members, cadres, and the masses to always pay attention to 
the central task of economic construction, to always set to 
right the relationship between reform and opening up and the 
adherence to the four cardinal principles, and to always persist 
in the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and being 
tough with both hands." At the same time, we must continuously 
get rid of the interference from the erroneous "left" and right 
ideas. We should guard against the right, but should primarily 
prevent the "left." Only by unswervingly upholding the party's 
basic line, can we ensure that our country will maintain 
long-term stability and order, can we put our socialist cause in 
an invincible position, and can we again win the glory of the 
Chinese nation. 
  Sixth, in studying Marxist theories we should particularly 
apply the Marxist "theory" at present to aim at overfulfilling 
the municipal "target" of becoming better-off in three years. 
In line with the current world situation and our country's 
reality, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has formulated the grand 
blueprint for the entire party and the people throughout the 
country regarding the realization of socialist modernization in 
three steps. As a matter of fact, people should eat their meal 
one mouthful after the other and cultivate their fields one by 
one. According to this saying, the current task of Beijing 
Municipality is to overfulfill the target of becoming better-off 
based on the results of having had the people dress warmly and 
eat their fill. We should accelerate the pace in reform, 
opening up, and economic development in line with the guiding 
principle of it being favorable for developing socialist social 
productive forces, for enhancing the comprehensive strength of 
socialist countries, and for upgrading the people's livelihood. 
Localities where conditions allow faster development should 
strive to achieve development as quickly as possible to 
contribute to the national undertakings of socialist 
modernization and to realizing the strategic target in three 
steps. 
  Comrades: The Marxist theories of dialectical and historical 
materialism constitute a system of revolutionary ideological 
theories, which is most perfect, systematic, and scientific. 
The more than 100-year history has eloquently proven that the 
powerful ideologically theoretical weapon of dialectical 
materialism is invincible. The law of human historical 
development, which has been exposed by the dialectical 
materialism, tells us that socialism will replace capitalism as 
capitalism did in the feudalist society. Such historical 
progress cannot be changed by anybody. China is determined to 
become prosperous and the victory scored by socialism with 
Chinese characteristics in China cannot be blocked by any force. 
We should rally round the CPC Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin at the core; uphold the dialectical materialism; 
earnestly study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought; study 
contemporary Marxism in China, Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and boldly 
march forward in line with our fixed fighting targets. We must 
realize the teaching by Comrade Mao Zedong during his life time, 
which reads that "China should make greater contributions to 
mankind." We must make efforts to build China, whose population 
accounts for one fifth of the total of the world, into a rich, 
strong, democratic, civilized, and socialist country. A 
success, itself, made by us in this regard represents an 
important contribution to mankind and will become the best 
commemoration offered by us to Comrade Mao Zedong.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb (AFP)--China defended Thursday [17 
February] its detention of five foreign missionaries, including 
three US citizens, saying they had violated sweeping new laws 
introduced this month to control religious activity. The three 
Americans and two Indonesians had "conducted illegal religious 
activities," in violation of new regulations governing religion 
which took effect January 31 and restrict the religious 
activities of foreigners in China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu 
Jianmin said. 
  Wu did not specify the nature of the activities, nor did he 
refer to two Hong Kong Chinese who were also detained February 
11 in central Henan province after attending an outdoor 
Christian prayer meeting. All seven missionaries -- led by 
Reverend Dennis Balcombe, a Mandarin-speaking evangelist and 
pastor of the Revival Christian Church in Hong Kong -- returned 
to the colony on Tuesday. The fate of three local Chinese 
detained at the same time remains unknown. 
  Wu said the local security officials had carried out 
"investigation, interrogation and detention" of the foreign 
missionaries in accordance with Chinese law, and had issued 
stern warnings. Balcombe, a frequent traveller to China, also 
had his visa revoked, Wu added. In a statement Wednesday, 
Balcombe said cash and property worth thousands of dollars had 
been taken by police from the group during their ordeal, during 
which the Hong Kong Chinese were also beaten and pulled by their 
hair. 
  "These people have acknowledged that they had violated 
Chinese laws and made guarantees that they would not conduct 
such activities anymore," Wu said. 
  They were believed to be the first Christians detained under 
the new regulations which prohibit foreigners from cultivating 
religious disciples in China and setting up religious offices or 
schools. While foreigners may bring in religious material for 
their own use, any materials which have contents harmful to 
China's social public interest are banned. 
  The regulations "embody the principle that China's religious 
bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign 
domination," Wu said, adding that foreigners would not be 
allowed to "harm the social public interest or interfere in 
China's religious affairs." Although freedom of religion is 
guaranteed in the Chinese constitution, the communist government 
has waged a constant campaign to prevent the spread of all 
faiths and limit contact between domestic and foreign religious 
organisations. 
  "As long as foreigners abide by the Chinese laws, they will 
have no trouble at all," Wu said. Well aware of the important 
role played by the church in the downfall of eastern European 
communism, religious repression -- including torture and 
detention of believers -- has intensified since early 1992, 
international human rights organisations say.

  [Text] Beijing, February 17 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said here this afternoon that the Chinese 
Government and people stand firmly opposed to the Taiwan 
Relations Act. 
  He made the statement at the weekly press conference when 
asked to comment on the assertion by the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act of the State Department of the United States 
for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 that on the issue of U.S. arms 
sales to Taiwan, the Taiwan Relations Act should supersede the 
Sino-U.S. Joint Communique issued on August 17, 1982. 
  He noted that the essence of the Taiwan Relations Act is to 
attempt to overrule the August 17 joint communique between China 
and the United States and legalize U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, 
stressing that this is what the Chinese Government and people 
stand firmly opposed to. 
  The August 17 joint communique is an international agreement 
reached between the two Governments of China and the United 
States, which the U.S. Government is obligated to strictly abide 
by in the principle that international laws prevail over 
domestic laws and take necessary measures to prevent the U.S. 
Congress from making any remarks and taking any actions which 
are in violation of this principle with a view to the 
maintenance of Sino-U.S. relations.

  [Text] Beijing, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei will visit Mozambique, 
Zimbabwe and Namibia from February 20 to March 2 at the 
invitation of the three countries' foreign ministries. 
  This was announced by a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign

  [Text] Beijing, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said here this afternoon that it 
is a basic policy of the Chinese Government to develop friendly 
relations and co-operation with Japan in a sustained and stable 
manner on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
co-existence. 
  He said this at the weekly press conference when asked to 
comment on an article of a Japanese magazine which asserted that 
China views Japan as a major enemy in 20 years. 
  He said this assertion is untenable and is designed by a 
very 
small number of people to sow discord. He pointed out that it 
is the common aspiration of the two peoples to carry on 
Sino-Japanese friendship from generation to generation, and it 
is a basic policy of the Chinese Government to develop friendly 
relations and co- operation with Japan in a sustained and stable 
manner on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
co-existence. 
  He noted that long-standing friendship and co-operation 
between China and Japan will not only benefit the two countries, 
but also contribute to the stability and prosperity of the 
region and the world at large.

"In What Direction Will U.S.-Japanese Trade Relations Go?"; 
Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 0853 GMT on 16 
February transmits a service message canceling the following 
item and asks that it be replaced with another version 
transmitted immediately after the service message; differences 
between the two items are noted] 
  [Text] Washington, 15 Feb (XINHUA) -- U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor announced here today that because 
Japan failed to fulfill the 1989 bilateral U.S.-Japanese 
agreement on telecommunications products, the United States 
would raise import tariffs -- in other words, impose so-called 
trade sanctions -- on Japanese-made cellular phones. Thus, the 
U.S.-Japanese trade conflicts that have been boiling for some 
time have eventually come to an "end." [variant version reads 
"U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced here today 
that he was sure that Japan had failed to fulfill the 1989 
bilateral U.S.-Japanese agreement on telecommunications 
products, and so Japan might be subjected to retaliatory 
actions." -- rewording paragraph] 
  Five year ago, the Japanese Government agreed that cellular 
phones produced by the U.S. Motorola company may have access to 
Japan, and Japan also promised that by 15 February 1994 the 
company's products would account for one-third to one-half of 
Tokyo's cellular phone market. Motorola, which is headquartered 
in Champion, Illinois, announced a few days ago that owing to 
the many restrictions imposed by the Japanese Government and by 
business circles, the company's products accounted for only 5 
percent of the Tokyo market, which is a far cry from Japan's 
promise. 
  In fact, the cellular phone trade is just a miniscule 
portion 
in terms of the economic interests of these two largest 
industrialized countries in the world. However, since the 
announcement of the trade sanctions was made on 11 February 
after the breakdown of the U.S.-Japanese summit talks, the 
dispute has become particularly eye-catching. The issue of 
where will U.S.-Japanese trade go from here has become a major 
topic of discussion and concern here. [variant version reads 
"Kantor added: `We have said many times that we are determined 
to achieve results in carrying out our trade agreement.' He 
stressed that the United States would announce within 30 days 
certain trade sanctions that had been contemplated." -- 
rewording paragraph] 
  Because it failed to reach an agreement on the eight months 
of talks on a framework for U.S.-Japanese trade, President 
Clinton's meeting with Prime Minister Hosokawa last Friday [11 
February] became the sides' first unsuccessful summit meeting 
after World War II. During the negotiations, the U.S. side 
insisted on using numerical targets as the yardstick for 
measuring the two countries' trade relations and said that Japan 
should first open for the United States its markets for 
automobiles, auto parts, telecommunications products, medical 
equipment, and insurance, but Japan stated that this was 
unacceptable. The negotiations ended unsuccessfully. 
  U.S.-Japanese trade relations over the last 20 years show 
that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan has soared drastically. 
The $1.3 billion trade deficit in 1971 soared to $21.6 billion 
in 1983 and to $54 billion in 1992. It is estimated that the 
trade deficit in 1993 would reach $60 billion. Meanwhile, the 
United States has also started to solve this problem through 
various channels of negotiations. The "market-oriented 
negotiations in individual sectors" during the early eighties 
involved telecommunications products, medical equipment, 
pharmaceuticals, timber, and automobiles; and during the latter 
part of the eighties, the United States tried to adopt the 
so-called "Super 301" section of the trade law to eliminate the 
trade barriers that Japan had imposed on U.S.-made 
supercomputers, satellites, and timber products. Ever since the 
1990's, the United States has started to tackle structural 
issues concerning U.S.-Japanese investment and trade -- issues 
such as investment barriers, antimonopoly measures, trade 
exclusivity, and so forth. 
  The Clinton administration has described the framework 
negotiations on U.S.-Japanese trade -- which started last July 
-- as the first U.S.-Japanese trade negotiations that paid 
attention to results, but Japan was offended by the U.S. attempt 
to "manage trade" using numerical targets. 
  In President Clinton's words, the 30 or so bilateral trade 
agreements that the United States and Japan have reached during 
the last decade or so are just "for show" because they have 
achieved nothing substantial in opening up Japan's markets. 
According to U.S. Government statistics, compared with other 
industrialized countries, the Japanese market is the smallest 
for foreign goods. Among other goods, [foreign] 
telecommunications products, insurance, and automobiles account 
for 5, 2, and 3 percent, respectively, of the Japanese market. 
Because expanding exports to Japan is one of the measures that 
the United States is pursuing to create job opportunities at 
home, President Clinton said that the United States can no 
longer wait. He said that while the U.S. sanctions on Japanese 
telecommunications products would be "just a coincidence," they 
may explain where the problems lie. 
  In their talks with the press, White House officials have 
tried everything to avoid using the phrase "trade war." 
Observers here maintain that U.S.-Japanese economic relations 
have developed to such an extent that they need each other and 
that neither side can gain in a large-scale trade war. Laura 
Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said on 
14 February that the time "is not yet ripe" for waging a trade 
war with Japan. She added, however, that a trade war might 
occur and so the "Japanese should think thrice." Observers here 
maintain that the United States has yet to state clearly what 
actions it will take following the failure of the U.S.-Japanese 
summit, and that the United States wants Japanese business 
circles to exercise pressure on the government and to force it 
to concede and that it also wants to force the Japanese yen to 
strengthen and affect the Tokyo stock market. 
  Currently the U.S. Government may have these options: 
restating the "Super 301" section of the trade law through an 
executive order of the President; demanding that the GATT 
conduct a special examination of Japan; accusing Japanese 
companies in the United States of violating the "antitrust law"; 
and classifying light trucks and sports cars imported from Japan 
as trucks so that the tariffs imposed on them can be raised from 
25 percent to tenfold [shi bei -- 0577 0223]. What moves Japan 
may take after the United States has contemplated taking 
retaliatory measures remain to be seen. [variant version reads 
"what moves the United States and Japan will take during the 
next 30 days merit attention." -- rewording last sentence]

"China Pays Close Attention to Consequences of Air Raid on 
Sarajevo"] 
  [Text]Stepping Up Preparations for Air Raid on Serb 
Troops 
  NATO fighters have doubled their number of sorties over the 
last few days. The fighters, which took off from U.S. aircraft 
carriers in the Adriatic Sea and from bases in Italy, kept a 
close watch on the movements of Serb troops besieging Sarajevo 
in a bid to force them to withdraw their heavy weapons, 
including artillery. Large-scale air raids seem unavoidable. 
The whole world is closely following developments in Bosnia, 
because the war is likely to develop into a long-term civil war, 
which will greatly jeopardize stability in Europe. 
  NATO took the trouble to sternly demand that Serb troops 
withdraw their heavy weapons within 10 days and place them under 
UN supervision. It is now only three days away from the 
deadline, but the Serb authorities, instead of withdrawing their 
heavy weapons as demanded, have warned the UN and NATO that Serb 
troops will retaliate if attacked. In that case, the war will 
escalate and the UN will become a belligerent, making the 
situation more complicated. 
<H5>  Interference Will Spread the Flames of War </H5>
  Since the civil war broke out in Bosnia, 200,000 people have 
unfortunately been killed, while Sarajevo has suffered the 
heaviest casualties. Serb troops are now besieging Sarajevo, 
which is in danger of falling into enemy hands, and they are 
trying to bottle up the Moslems by using hunger and the terror 
of war. A large number of Sarajevo citizens were attacked by 
mortars while lining up for bread on 5 February, and 68 people 
were killed and 198 wounded. This was the blackest tragedy since 
the beginning of the civil war. The Bosnian Government, which is 
mainly composed of Moslems, strongly condemned Serb troops for 
the atrocity, which made one's blood boil. The Serbs, however, 
solemnly claimed that the Moslems had tried to win the sympathy 
of the outside world by inflicting casualties on their own 
people. They said a similar incident also occurred in Sarajevo 
in May 1992, when citizens queuing for bread were attacked by 
three mortars, killing 17 people and wounding more than 100. 
After the incident, Moslems and Serbs accused each other of the 
crime. For this reason, the Security Council applied sanctions 
against the new Yugoslavia [name as published], including a ban 
on petroleum exports to the country. 
  Up to now, no evidence has shown who should be held 
responsible for the tragedy. This being the case, it is 
imprudent [zao ci 6644 2945] for the UN to carry out bombing 
raids. 
  Chen Jian, China's deputy representative to the UN, said at 
a 
Security Council meeting yesterday that the use of air power in 
Bosnia by the UN should be restricted to protecting its 
peace-keeping forces. He also pointed out that further military 
action in Bosnia could possibly lead to undesirable consequences 
rather than helping provide a political solution to a local 
conflict. 
<H5>  Air Raids Will Not Solve Any Problems </H5>
  Russian Defense Minister Grachev also expressed his 
opposition to air raids on 14 February for the reason that, 
after air raids, if Serb troops wage a guerrilla war against UN 
peace-keeping forces, NATO will be unable to defeat these 
guerrilla forces unless it sends large numbers of ground troops. 
  In the Gulf war, the powerful U.S. Air Force could play a 
decisive role because the war was fought over a stretch of 
desert. But Sarajevo is surrounded by mountains. The UN air 
forces can destroy Serb artillery bases at one stroke, but it 
will find it difficult to eliminate guerrilla forces in the 
mountains. The former Soviet Union, which suffered great losses 
because of its interference with internal conflicts in 
Afghanistan, provides a good example in this respect. Again, as 
soon as any air raid begins, hopes for peace talks among the 
three nations in Bosnia will be killed, the war will drag on, 
and there will more casualties. The UN should think about these 
consequences thrice before it acts.

  [Text] Moscow, February 16 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl exchanged views 
over the Bosnia crisis and explored the possibility of a 
peaceful solution to the problem in a telephone conversation 
today. 
  The Russian president stressed that the settlement of the 
current crisis should correspond to UN resolutions, the INTERFAX 
NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  However, the news reports did not give details of the 
discussion, saying that the two leaders agreed to continue their 
dialogue over the Bosnia situation. 
  In a related development, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Sergey Lavrov today accused the Western threats to bomb Serb 
military positions of "illegitimate." [sentence as received] 
  "We are doing everything to prevent air strikes," Lavrov 
said. "and we consider the NATO ultimatum illegitimate." 
  Russian officials have opposed NATO air strikes against the 
Serbs, who have ethnic and religious ties to Russia. Yeltsin 
told reporters Tuesday [15 February] after a meeting with 
British Prime Minister John Major that Russia sought to resolve 
the crisis by peaceful means. 
  "Russia will play an active role in the negotiating process 
in order to resolve the Yugoslav conflict by peaceful means," 
said Yeltsin. 
  The decision on air strikes should be left to the United 
Nations, the Russian president said, adding that air raids would 
be justified only if UN peacekeepers were attacked.

  [Text] Moscow, Feburary 16 (XINHUA) -- Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said here today that the current 
Russian diplomatic activities are aimed at blocking the 
implementation of NATO's ultimatum on air strikes against 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  "We are doing everything to prevent air strikes," Lavrov 
announced in parliament, "and we consider the NATO ultimatum 
illegitimate." 
  Russian repersentatives to the UN Security Council were 
instructed to oppose NATO air strikes, he said, adding that as a 
request by Moscow, the UN Security Council had created a special 
committee to investigate the earlier mortar shell explosion in a 
downtown Sarajevo marketplace, in which 68 civilians were killed 
and 200 wounded. 
  The Russian official said that even a limited air strike 
against Serb military positions would alter fundamentally the 
political and military situation in Bosnia and the whole of 
Europe. 
  It would mean, he said, the failure of a peaceful settlement 
of the Bosnia conflict. 
  The deputy foreign minister said that NATO's threat to bomb 
did not correspond to UN decisions. Russia was prepared to 
object to any actions running counter to UN resolutions, he 
noted.

  [Text] Bucharest, February 16 (XINHUA) -- Romania and 
Croatia today urged the international community and warring 
sides in Bosnia to continue their efforts of peace to solve the 
conflict in the former Yugoslav republic. 
  This call was made by Romanian President Ion Iliescu and his 
Croat counterpart Franjo Tudjman at a joint press conference 
here. 
  The two leaders said they do not want to see the NATO plan 
for air strikes on Bosnian Serbs become a reality. 
  Iliescu said resorting to force could not help solve any 
problem and, on the contrary, will befoul the political 
atmosphere and hinder efforts to solve the problem. 
  Tudjman said air strikes will result in more casualties and 
escalate the conflict. He hoped Romania will play an important 
role in seeking a political solution. 
  Tudjman ended his three-day visit here on Wednesday. During 
the visit, the two countries signed a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation and one on trucking and scientific research 
cooperations.

  [Text] Washington, February 16 (XINHUA) -- Following 
refusals from major European countries to send more troops to 
Sarajevo, the United Nations is asking the U.S. for extra troops 
to the Bosnian capital, the State Department confirmed today. 
  "The United Nations has sought the request for additional 
troops. The United States was among the group of countries 
approached by the United Nations," State Department Spokeswoman 
Christine Shelly said. 
  The United States has all the way insisted that it will not 
send ground troops to Bosnia unless the three warring sides 
reach a peace settlement in good faith. 
  Shelly refused to give more details on the request, but said 
"The U.S. position on troops remains unchanged." 
  A senior State Department official was quoted as saying that 
the administration was looking at the request at the "highest 
levels." 
  The United Nations protection force in Bosnia is asking for 
2,500 to 3,000 more troops to demilitarize Sarajevo to 
consolidate a ceasefire. 
  France, Britain and The Netherlands have all refused to 
dispatch more troops. 
  Russia has also dismissed a request for its paratroops to be 
transferred from Croatia to Bosnia. 
  France, Britain and The Netherlands are the major 
contributors of troops to Bosnia under the U.N., with 6,000, 
2,500, and 2,400 troops respectively.

  [Text] Bonn, February 16 (XINHUA) -- United Nations 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has said it has not been 
decided whether NATO or the U.N. should order to carry out the 
threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions around 
Sarajevo when the NATO ultimatum expires. 
  In an interview published by the German weekly magazine "DIE 
WOCHE," the U.N. Chief said there will be no hesitation in 
implementing relevant Security Council resolutions by means of 
air strikes. 
  "If NATO grants me full powers, I can act immediately, 
because I already have the full power of the U.N.," he was 
quoted as saying. 
  When asked whether Germany should send troops to participate 
in proposed U.N. actions, the secretary general said that in 
strengthening the status of the U.N., Germany plays a very 
significant role in the world. 
  NATO issued a 10-day ultimatum ordering Bosnian Serbs to 
withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo by midnight 
GMT on Sunday [20 February], or face allied air strikes. 
  The ultimatum came after a mortar attack on a Sarajevo 
street 
market in early February killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200. 
  Over the past few days the international community has tried 
to avert an escalation of the Bosnian war in hopes that the NATO 
ultimatum will be able to end the Bosnian war. 
  In Washington, meanwhile, Clinton administration officials 
have reiterated that the Bosnian Serbs must turn over their 
artillery and mortars to the United Nations, move the weapons 
out of range of Sarajevo, or render them "inoperable."

  [Text] Belgrade, February 16 (XINHUA) -- The speaker of 
the Bosnian Serb parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, said Wednesday 
[16 February] that the Serbian side will fully carry out the 
ceasefire agreement with the Muslims by submitting all their 
heavy weapons to UN control. 
  Speaking at the "Poeitika" television station, Krajisnik 
said, "We are committed to fully respect the Muslim-Serb 
agreement and its provisions calling for the control of heavy 
weaponry and demarcation lines." 
  "This concerns the basic interests of the Serbian people, 
and 
we cannot in any way raise any problem to the agreement," he 
said. 
  He warned that the danger of Serbian people being bombed 
"has 
never been greater than now." "We are very serious about the 
threat. We must be fully prepared for air strikes," he said. 
  He expressed the hope that by submitting the heavy weapons, 
"The will of the forces calling for the bombing of Serbian 
positions will be partially satisfied." 
  Meanwhile, former commander of the United Nations Protection 
Force (Unprofor) General Jean Cote said the Serbian side has 
promised to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo 
before the NATO deadline of midnight GMT Sunday, or put them 
under UN control. 
  He said the Muslim side has promised to do the same. 
  United Nations commander Lieutenant General Michael Rose 
today warned that if the warring sides do not submit their 
weaponry before the NATO deadline, the Western alliance will 
definitely use force. 
  NATO also said today that it will not wait one minute more 
in 
executing the air strike plan after the deadline is reached. 
  Bosnian Serb Defense Minister Dushan Kovachevich said today 
that if NATO really carries out air strikes on Serbian 
positions, the Serbians will defend themselves by all means 
necessary. 
  He expressed the hope that a "wise party" will be heeded 
within NATO. 
  Reports said convoys of artillery could be seen moving along 
the highways outside Sarajevo toward destinations selected by 
the UN command. 
  Spokesman Bill Eikman said today that the UN is deploying 
forces in preparation for air strikes, and that 3,000 more UN 
troops are expected to arrive in Sarajevo soon. 
  However, Spain and France have reportedly refused to 
increase 
the number of their troops, and Russia has refused to allow its 
UN soldiers to move close to Sarajevo.

  [Text] Washington, February 16 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States urged Greece today to reconsider its decision to close 
the port of Salonika to Macedonia and its consulate in the 
former Yugoslav republic's capital. 
  "Constructive relations between Greece and the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are certainly essential to 
regional stability," State Department spokeswoman Christine 
Shelly said. 
  Meanwhile, a senior administration official was quoted as 
saying that the U.S. ambassador to Athens would submit a 
diplomatic note to the Greek Foreign Ministry Thursday [17 
February] and the Greek ambassador to the U.S. might also be 
summoned to the State Department. 
  The remarks came after Greek prime minister's announcement 
earlier that Athens would stop the flow of goods from the 
Salonika port to the land-locked Macedonia, except humanitarian 
supplies. 
  Washington recognized Macedonia on February 9, but using the 
name of "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" in order not 
to anger either side. 
  "We would certainly hope that every effort could be made to 
try to avoid any particular actions which might aggravate the 
situation or lead to some kind of an increase in tensions," 
Shelly said. 
  Greece has been trying to block international recognition of 
Macedonia, saying the name "Macedonia" could be exploited for 
territorial claims against its province with the same name. 
  About 50,000 Greek citizens protested Tuesday against the 
U.S. recognition of the Balkan republic. 
  Macedonia, with a population of some two million Slavs and 
ethnic Albanians, declared its independence in 1991.

<F P=106> ["Comment on International Issues" by Xiao Feng (5135 2800): </F>
"The Transitional Characteristics of Key Points of U.S. 
Diplomatic Strategy"] 
  [Text] After the Seattle meeting, Clinton told reporters: 
"Western Europe will continue to be the center of our relations 
with our allies, but the United States remains most concerned 
about economic issues. The future of the United States is 
closely related to the Asia-Pacific region, which is recording 
the fastest economic growth in the world, so we must develop our 
relations with this region." U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher also said: "In the 21st century, no other region 
will be more important than the Asia- Pacific region to the 
United States." All this shows that the United States has 
substantially adjusted its diplomatic policy, which has become 
noticeably inclined toward the Asia-Pacific region. 
  People made different assessments on the degree to which the 
United States would adjust its Asia-Pacific strategy. One 
opinion holds that the focus of U.S. diplomatic strategy had 
shifted to the Asia-Pacific region. The other opinion holds 
that the focus of U.S. diplomatic strategy as a whole remains in 
Europe, and it will only be shifted to the Asia-Pacific region 
in the future. It seems that both opinions are not completely 
correct. As the Cold War just ended recently, U.S. diplomatic 
strategy remains in a process of adjustment, and its strategic 
focus still bears the characteristics of being "transitional" 
and replaceable. One should not simply follow the conventional 
concept of "only one focus." After the dissolution of the 
Soviet Union, tremendous changes occurred in the world pattern, 
and U.S. diplomatic strategy is also facing comprehensive 
adjustments. In the process of adjustments, actual conditions 
and objective contradictions did not develop to a degree which 
required a comprehensive shift in focus. That is, the original 
focus could not be removed immediately, and the new focus could 
not be established in one single move. Instead, there would be 
a period of transition and replacement. In such a period, there 
would not be only "one focus"; instead, "two" different "foci" 
would appear at the same time. This has been shown by the 
speeches of U.S. Government leaders. Shortly after the Seattle 
meeting, Christopher said that during the cold war, the United 
States had naturally focused its strategy on Europe, because it 
had to contain the Soviet Union. "Today, we are watching every 
region of the globe at the same time. Due to our economic and 
security needs, we have interests in Asia." When attending the 
NATO summit meeting in Brussels, Clinton also said explicitly: 
"The core of U.S. security remains in Europe." However, he 
added: "It is beyond doubt that Europe is not the only key 
point about which the United States cares." They made it clear 
that the United States would "watch every region at the same 
time" and that Europe would remain the "core of U.S. security" 
but "not the only key point." All this means that there is more 
than one key point in U.S. diplomatic strategy. 
  Europe remains the focus of U.S. diplomacy, because most of 
the world's developed countries are in Europe. In the present 
stage and for a fairly long time to come, Europe will continue 
to be the center of international struggle, and the United 
States must lay the focus of its diplomacy in Europe. Because 
many allies of the United States are European countries and the 
United States is trying to maintain its status as the leader of 
the West and the world, it will have to first maintain its 
leading position in Europe. Recently, extreme nationalist 
forces have risen in Russia, and this cannot but cause concern 
and apprehension to the United States. In addition, the United 
States is still trying to keep more than 100,000 troops in 
Europe after the end of the Cold War, and this shows that Europe 
remains the key point of U.S. security interests. However, 
because of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the direct 
threat to U.S. security has disappeared, and the United States 
has also adjusted and scaled down its European strategy. For 
example, in order to lighten the European defense burden, the 
United States has tried to let the European nations bear as much 
of the defense role as possible. Therefore, although Europe 
remains the focus of U.S. strategy, it is not quite the same as 
in the Cold War period. 
  The United States not only has major security interests in 
Europe, but it also has major economic interests there. At 
present, the United States gains 60 percent of its profits 
earned overseas from Europe, over half of its overseas 
investments are in Europe, and 65 percent of foreign investment 
in the United States is from Europe. Although Europe is so 
important to U.S. economic interests, the United States has 
begun to shift the strategic "focus" of its "economic security" 
to the Asia-Pacific region, because U.S. investment in Asia has 
been increasing faster than in other regions, and its bilateral 
trade with Asia greatly exceeds that with Europe. According to 
statistics, between 1989 and 1992, U.S. direct investment in 
Asia (excluding Japan) increased by 56 percent, far higher than 
the 26-percent growth in overall U.S. investment overseas in 
this period. According to a survey conducted by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, the rate of return from U.S. investment 
in Asia between 1989 and 1991 exceeded 23 percent, which was 
almost twice as much as the average rate of investment returns 
in the 24 major industrial countries in the world in the same 
period. The annual volume of bilateral trade between the United 
States and Asia exceeds $360 billion, which is more than four 
times that of 15 years ago and nearly 40 percent higher than the 
volume of bilateral trade between the United States and Europe. 
Although it will still take time for U.S. economic interests in 
Asia to exceed those in Europe in all fields, the development 
tendency as a whole has already shown that the focus of U.S. 
economic interests is being shifted to the Asia-Pacific region. 
  In short, it is still too early to say that the focus of 
U.S. diplomatic strategy as a whole has been completely shifted 
to the Asia-Pacific region, and it is also unrealistic to say 
that the focus of U.S. diplomatic strategy as a whole remains in 
Europe. In the post-Cold War transitional period and at the turn 
of the century, adjustments in U.S. diplomatic strategy will 
bear a transitional nature. At present and for a certain period 
to come, there cannot be just "one focus"; instead, there will 
be two different "key points." Concretely speaking, the focus 
of political and military "security interests" in U.S. 
diplomatic strategy remain in Europe for now, but the focus of 
its economic interests has been shifted to the Asia-Pacific 
region. Because the United States places economic policy at the 
center of its diplomatic strategy, the development tendency 
shows that the Asia-Pacific region will hold an increasingly 
important position in U.S. diplomatic strategy.

  [Text] Beijing, February 16 (XINHUA) -- Apples from 
Washington state, in the north-west of the U.S.A., are to be 
allowed into China -- with provisos that they are free of the 
Mediterranean fruit fly pest. 
  China's National General Institute of Animal and Plant 
Quarantine has recently agreed to the apple imports, provided 
they meet a number of conditions. 
  It has signed an agreement with its counterpart in the 
United 
States on the hygiene conditions of the apples of Washington 
state to be exported to China, and the conditions of the 
orchards. 
  Under the agreement, the apples to be exported to China must 
be produced in the area designated by the Chinese National 
Animal and Plant Quarantine Institute. That area must be free 
of the Mediterranean fruit fly. The fruit must be packed, 
frozen and stored by designated factories after being strictly 
quarantined by the U.S. quarantine institutes. 
  The fruit will have to meet the quarantine requirements of 
China and must enter the country through designated ports. Only 
after being quarantined by the Chinese quarantine institutes can 
the fruit be put on sale in China. 
  Mediterranean fruit fly is destructive to fruit. So far, 
China is free from the pest. But it has been found in some 
parts of the United States, though not in Washington state. 
  In recent years, the demands of the Chinese market for 
foreign fruit have kept growing.

  [Text] Beijing, February 16 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
is actually stepping up efforts to export its own prison-made 
goods, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR newspaper reports. 
  The newspaper, in an article published on February 9, quoted 
American prison rights activists as criticizing the U.S. policy 
as "hypocritical." 
  The U.S. newspaper quoted Brad Haga, marketing director for 
Oregon Prison Industries, the state agency overseeing the 
manufacture of prison goods, as revealing that Oregon will 
export an estimated 3 million U.S. dollars worth of prison-made 
jeans and shirts this year to Japan, Italy and other countries. 
  According to the article, California prisons export less 
prison-made clothing than Oregon, but have so far sent test 
orders to Japan and Malaysia. 
  Corey Weinstein, a board member of the California Prisoners 
Rights Union, was also quoted as saying that the U.S. Government 
typically "complains of human-rights violations in other 
countries but cares not one bit about human-rights violations in 
the United States". 
  Haga admitted that the two different policies the U.S. 
Government is pursuing on prison exports "may smack of 
old-fashioned imperialism." 
  Weinstein stressed that as long as California exports 
prison-made goods, the United States "has no basis" for 
criticizing other countries involved in the same practice.

  [Text] Moscow, February 15 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin stressed today that the Bosnian crisis should be 
resolved through negotiations, but insisted that Russia would 
take an active role in helping end the war in former Yugoslavia. 
  Yeltsin explained: "Some people are trying to solve the 
problems of Bosnia without Russia. We shall not allow this to 
happen." 
  In an interview with reporters after he and visiting British 
Prime Minister John Major signed a joint statement on reciprocal 
non-targeting of strategic missiles, the Russian president also 
stressed the need for the heavy guns deployed around Sarajevo, 
the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to be handed over to U.N. 
forces. 
  Yeltsin told reporters that the Bosnian problem was 
discussed 
in detail during his talks this morning with Major. 
  "Our stands are identical on the main point; that it is 
necessary for the heavy guns to be handed over to U.N. forces to 
bring an end to the shelling. 
  "Moreover," Yeltsin said, "both sides have confirmed during 
the talks that the Bosnian problem should be resolved primarily 
by peaceful means, through negotiations." 
  "This will allow us to put an end to the war in former 
Yugoslavia," he said. 
  He reminded reporters that the Bosnian problem was now being 
discussed in the U.N. Security Council. 
  "This body must issue a mandate to the blue helmets (U.N. 
peacekeepers) to accept the guns removed from positions around 
Sarajevo. This is important," he said. 
  However, the president added that he believed that the 
strategic positions of the hostile parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
could be bombed only if U.N. forces were attacked and called for 
help. 
  Meanwhile, the joint statement signed by Yeltsin and Major 
immediately after their talks in the Kremlin stipulates that the 
two countries would not order their strategic nuclear missiles 
to be targeted at each other. The agreement come into effect 
not later than May 30, 1994.

"DPRK Is Willing To Accept International Nuclear Inspection"] 
  [Text]It Helps Ease the Tense Situation on the Korean 
Peninsula 
  The International Atomic Agency [IAA] and the DPRK reached 
an 
agreement on nuclear inspections on 15 February in Vienna. 
According to the IAA spokesman, the DPRK informed the IAA that 
it is willing to let the IAA inspect its nuclear installations. 
If there is no abrupt change or turnaround, it will ease the 
situation on the Korean peninsula and will have a good impact on 
the DPRK's economic development. 
  The DPRK made public its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty last March. Suddenly, the international 
community put more stake in the widely circulating rumor that 
the DPRK was secretly and intensively developing nuclear 
weapons. In particular, the anxiety of the ROK, the United 
States, and Japan was expressed repeatedly by their officials 
and their media. Not long ago, the United States said that 
economic sanctions would be applied against Pyongyang and that 
U.S. "Patriot" missiles would be deployed in the ROK. Japan 
also suggested indirectly that it had the capability to rapidly 
develop nuclear bombs. The ROK was particularly on alert. 
  For a long time, the DPRK has seldom made contact with the 
outside world, and the international community does not have an 
appropriate and normal understanding of its political, economic, 
and military situations. Moreover, the annual U.S.-ROK joint 
military exercises cause the authorities in Pyongyang to lose 
their trust in the outside world and make them more nervous. 
Not long ago, there was a rumor that the DPRK had deployed many 
more troops in areas north of the 38th parallel. The DPRK has 
strong military strength, but its domestic economic situation is 
extremely difficult. In particular, with the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union, regular economic aid has been cut off, 
gasoline and energy are in short supply, foreign exchange has 
been exhausted, and its people are living in privation. 
Moreover, President Kim Il-song is getting old, and it is still 
not known whether his son Kim Chong-il will be able to succeed 
him. The outside world has expressed different views on the 
question of whether Kim Chong-il can assume the great task of 
leading the DPRK, but most are pessimistic. 
<H3>  China Is Concerned About the Situation on the Korean 
Peninsula </H3>
  The DPRK should, however, pay closest attention to its 
economic problems. The DPRK has still failed to break away from 
its impoverished state. Naturally, China, as a close neighbor 
of the DPRK, is very concerned about the situation. From the 
Korean war to the post-war construction period, China paid a 
high price for selflessly aiding the DPRK. However, with the 
changes in the global situation, particularly after China 
started implementing the policy of opening up to the outside 
world in the 1980's, tremendous new changes have taken place in 
China's economy. China very much hopes that the DPRK can draw 
on its experience and adopt flexible domestic and foreign 
policies to attract foreign investment, to develop the domestic 
economy, and to ease relations with the ROK first before 
discussing economic exchanges between the North and the South. 
  To our disappointment, however, the two Koreas have not been 
able to get beyond their feelings of mutual distrust, even 
though they have repeatedly held contacts with one other. 
Consequently, financial groups in the south still cannot invest 
in the north. The two sides of the strait are engaged in 
massive economic dealings with one another, which brings many 
advantages to compatriots on both sides. Hence, the DPRK should 
draw on China's example to adopt its own flexible policies. 
<H3>  The Improvement of U.S.-Vietnamese Relations Does Have an 
Impact </H3>
  Pyongyang's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty has damaged its international image. If it really 
develops nuclear weapons, it will not have the national strength 
to bear the burden of the consequences, which may even slow down 
economic development. Today, the DPRK has come to the stage in 
which it must change course and strike out on a new path. 
  Ronald Dellums, chairman of the U.S. House of 
Representatives 
Armed Services Committee, will visit Pyongyang in the next few 
days to try to break the deadlock over U.S.-DPRK relations. 
This kind of high-level direct contact helps promote mutual 
understanding. The fact that agreement has been reached on the 
issue of nuclear inspections will be more advantageous to 
improving bilateral relations between the United States and the 
DPRK. It was reported that Kim Il-song had asked Billy Graham, 
a U.S. religious figure who had earlier visited Pyongyang, to 
convey to Clinton his suggestion of holding a U.S.-DPRK summit. 
Viewed from this angle, it seems that Pyongyang is ready to 
change its U.S. policy. 
  The United States and Vietnam fought a bloody war for a 
decade, but their relations have greatly improved recently, and 
this should help awaken Pyongyang.

  [Text] Chen Xitong, secretary of the Beijing Municipal 
party committee and honorary president of the Beijing Municipal 
People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, met 
with Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi, president of the 
Beijing-Matsushita Color Kinescope Company Limited, who had just 
left his post, and his wife on the evening of 24 January. 
  Chen Xitong said: Beijing's enterprise signed a cooperation 
contract with the Matsushita Company eight or nine years ago. 
Now the Beijing-Matsushita Color Kinescope Company Limited has 
built three production lines and put its new product "Huawang" 
on the market. This shows that our cooperation has blossomed 
and has borne fruit. 
  He said: Mr. Matsushita Konosuke died several months before 
the inauguration of the Beijing-Matsushita Company, which was 
very regrettable. However, he had great foresight to select 
such a man as Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi to carry on his 
unfulfilled wish. Chinese people have a good tradition of 
remembering all the friends who have helped us. When China is 
conducting reform and opening up today, we particularly need the 
cooperation of the friends in the world and are also very 
grateful to them. 
  Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi expressed thanks for his appraisal. 
He said: This project in Beijing is merely the first step of 
the ideals of Mr. Matsushita Konosuke and it must succeed. 
Therefore, I have exerted my utmost efforts during my six-year 
stay in Beijing. The success should be attributed to the 
comprehensive support of Beijing Municipality and the selfless 
workers of the entire company. 
  After the meeting, Chen Xitong gave a wall carpet bearing 
the 
drawing of the Great Wall and an album to Mr. Ninagawa 
Chikayoshi and his wife. 
  Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing, also met with Mr. Ninagawa 
Chikayoshi and his wife recently. Li Qiyan said: Today's 
development of the Beijing-Matsushita Color Kinescope Company 
Limited is the result of the concerted efforts of both sides. 
You are a very competent entrepreneur and we thank you for your 
contributions. After returning to your country, it is hoped 
that you will continue to publicize the friendly causes 
developed by China and Japan and draw more Japanese friends to 
Beijing to make investments and build plants. You and your wife 
are also welcome to visit Beijing anytime. Li Qiyan also 
presented a certificate of honor to Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi. 
Municipal leaders Tie Ying, Lu Yucheng, Li Runwu, and Zhang 
Peng were present at the meetings.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Israel and China are set to renew high-level 
diplomatic contact after a three-month hiatus which followed the 
death of a Chinese politician in a mysterious helicopter crash 
near the Dead Sea. 
  The Communist Party General-Secretary, Jiang Zemin, and 
another member of the politburo are likely to visit Israel in 
the first half of the year. China's ministers of power 
industry, water resources and construction are also prospective 
visitors, according to Israeli diplomatic sources. 
  Israel's Minister of Trade and Industry and the Minister of 
Finance will visit China during the same period. 
  None of the visits will be officially announced until later 
this month when the Israeli Ministry of Transport releases its 
report on the death of the Shenyang mayor, Wu Disheng, in a 
helicopter crash last November. 
  High-level contacts between Beijing and Jerusalem were 
unofficially suspended after Wu's death. The helicopter crashed 
after a mysterious explosion shortly after take-off. 
  The Ministry of Transport report is likely to attribute the 
crash to a "grave technical fault", the source said. 
  Diplomats on both sides say there is no suspicion of 
sabotage, although Shenyang took the precaution of hiring a 
lawyer to watch its interests as the investigation proceeded. 
  Beijing signalled its desire to put the matter to rest last 
month when it appointed the former vice-mayor of Shenyang, Zhang 
Rongmao, as acting mayor. 
  "We had a good thing going until the accident," one Israeli 
diplomat said. 
  "We're trying to rebuild the relationship in good taste, but 
it will only be appropriate after the report is released." 
  Details about the visit by Wu and other Shenyang officials 
remain unclear, but sources in Shenyang said Zhang Li, the head 
of the city's economic development zone, who was also killed in 
the crash, was there to discuss an "Israel technology centre" 
planned for the zone. 
  Shenyang is home to one of the People's Liberation Army's 
largest firms, Shanyou Industrial Company, which already has 
joint technology projects with South Korea and countries in the 
former USSR. 
  An Israeli diplomat said: "Our ideal project is to bring 
Israeli technology to China. Shenyang was a good example of 
where this could have happened." 
  Burgeoning military links between Beijing and Tel Aviv in 
such fields as fighter aircraft, air-to-air missiles, tanks and 
airborne radar were revealed by the United States Central 
Intelligence Agency last October. 
  "Building on a long history of close defence industrial 
relations ... China and Israel appear to be moving towards 
formalising and broadening their military technical 
cooperation," the CIA said. 
  It pointed to recently signed technology exchange deals 
covering electronics and space as evidence of the growing trend 
to formalise the relationship. The CIA feared this could lead 
to a transfer of Western technology to China in violation of 
Western bilateral pacts with Israel. 
  The Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, who was in 
Beijing 
when the CIA report was made public, said the estimate that 
sales might amount to "several billions of dollars" was grossly 
exaggerated. 
  In 1992, he said, the figure was about HK$470m [Hong Kong 
dollars].

  [Text] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto's special envoy, 
Professor N.D. Khan, has held talks in Beijing with the Chinese 
foreign minister, Mr. Qian Qichen, and other leaders on human 
rights abuses by Indian troops in occupied Kashmir. During the 
talks, he delivered a letter from the prime minister for 
President Jiang Zemin. 
  Later, talking to APP [Associated Press of Pakistan] before 
his departure for Tehran, the special envoy said that the letter 
was very specific on human rights violations and atrocities by 
the Indian troops in occupied Kashmir, particularly the 
molestation of women. He said the Kashmir issue was among the 
top priorities of the present government and is the arch-pivot 
of Pakistan's foreign policy. He said that Pakistan intended to 
move a resolution in the third week of this month in Human 
Rights Commission in Geneva on the situation in occupied 
Kashmir. It will express concern on the happenings there. He 
described his talks with Chinese leaders as fruitful and 
constructive.

  [Text] Tunis, February 15 (XINHUA) -- Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat has chaired a series of meetings of the 
Central Committee of Fatah movement and the PLO Executive 
Committee during the last few days, reliable Palestinian sources 
said here today. 
  The meetings discussed the Cairo deal and the latest 
developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. 
  Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres signed a 
partial agreement in Cairo last Wednesday [6 February], which 
deals with the implementation of the September 13 PLO-Israeli 
peace accord. 
  The sources told XINHUA here today that the Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee held a meeting 
last Sunday, with PLO Chairman 'Arafat presiding. A number of 
committee members were absent. 'Arafat explained the Cairo deal 
at the meeting. 
  Abu-'Alaa' [Ahmad Quray'], head of the Economic Department 
of 
the PLO, made a speech on the economic talks between the PLO and 
Israel, pointing out obstacles in these talks. 
  No agreement was reached on finance, trade or customs so 
far, 
he said. 
  As for the meetings of the Central Committee of Fatah 
movement -- PLO's major group, the sources said that differences 
on the Cairo deal are still standing, pointing out that some 
members called for amendment to some articles. 
  These amendments, the sources say, must be compatible with 
the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people. 
  The Palestinian sources stressed that President 'Arafat 
convinced his aides that what was signed in Cairo was a draft 
agreement, but not a final agreement. 
  The draft is amendable and negotiable and it prepares for 
the 
signing of a final agreement on the implementation of Israel's 
pullout from Gaza and Jericho, 'Arafat said.

<F P=106> [Report: "The Chinese Side Is Studying the Airport </F>
Financial Arrangements and Is Willing to Exchange Views With the 
British Side"] 
  [Text] Guo Fengmin, Chinese chief representative to the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, said yesterday (16 February) 
that the Chinese side has initially studied the British side's 
fourth set of financial arrangements for the airport, adding 
that there is still one question to study and a need to exchange 
views with the British side. He hoped that the Airport 
Authority experts group could call a meeting this month. 
  Guo Fengmin made these remarks while attending a Lunar New 
Year gathering sponsored by the Heung Yu Kuk [local consultative 
bodies in the New Territories]. He pointed out: On the airport 
issue, not long ago, some people from the British side said that 
the Chinese side had not raised comprehensive suggestions at 
all, but subsequently they said that the British side's 
proposals completely met the Chinese side's demands. This is 
contradictory. 
  Guo Fengmin further explained: Since the Chinese side did 
not raise any comprehensive suggestions, why did the British 
side say that its proposals completely met the Chinese side's 
demand? As a matter of fact, at an Airport Authority meeting in 
August last year, the Chinese side had already systematically 
put forward its suggestions. It took almost six months for the 
British side to raise its proposals. Who is delaying after all? 
  On granting land approvals, he said that the Airport 
Authority would certainly discuss land approvals, but some 
detailed questions would have to be discussed by the Land 
Commission [Sino-British Land Commission]. 
  Guo Fengmin said that the defense experts group meeting of 
the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group had been delayed too long 
by the British side. He hoped that major progress would be made 
at this meeting.

<F P=106> [By Political Editor Mary Binks] </F>
  [Text] China has dashed hopes of a speedy resolution to 
the protracted wrangling with Britain over the financing of the 
Chek Lap Kok airport. Beijing yesterday gave its first 
indications of dissatisfaction with the latest financing 
proposal submitted by the British side more than a week ago. 
Britain's fourth funding proposal in a year was believed to 
have met China's demand for a bigger equity injection to cushion 
debts incurred by the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) and 
the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC). But Chinese 
sources yesterday said the obstacles to agreement remained 
two-fold. 
  The proposed equity injection of $60 billion is contingent 
on 
China's approval of an additional land grant. Britain wants 62 
hectares of land along the airport rail link sold under a 
gradual sell-off. The grant would be in addition to the annual 
50-hectare ceiling for land sales stipulated in annexe three of 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration. But the Chinese side 
remains concerned about the effect of this on the coffers of the 
post-1997 Special Administrative Region (SAR) government. 
Sources said the Chinese side was reluctant to change the 
arrangement under which this land could be disposed of only by 
the SAR government. 
  The other obstacle was the Chinese side's dissatisfaction 
with what it regarded as Britain's failure to establish an 
independent committee to monitor the cost of the airport 
project. It maintained that the British side had persistently 
circumvented the Airport Consultative Committee, a body set up 
to oversee financing arrangements. 
  Despite China's concerns over the latest funding proposal, 
it 
is expected to propose a meeting of the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG) Airport Committee next week. Chinese JLG 
team leader Guo Fengmin yesterday confirmed that Beijing had 
studied the fourth financing proposal, but that there were 
problems which needed to be discussed. Mr Guo would not 
elaborate. Three rounds of JLG expert meetings are expected to 
be held in the next two weeks. Next week, the two sides will 
try to resolve the impasse on the future of military sites in 
Hong Kong after 1997.

<F P=106> [By Jim Cheung] </F>
  [Text] Pro-Beijing candidates in this year's district 
board elections have been urged to avoid splitting their vote. 
The call came from the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the 
Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB). 
  September's election looks set to be a litmus test of 
democracy in Hong Kong, with a close contest between the liberal 
and pro-China factions. The United Democrats, Meeting Point and 
the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood have 
already struck an unprecedented electoral deal to avoid putting 
up competing candidates. Now, pro-China factions are looking at 
similar measures. 
  The DAB's vice-chairman, legislator Tam Yiu-chung, said 
yesterday he would welcome the co-operation of other pro-China 
candidates or parties intending to contest the election. He 
added that his party had not yet canvassed support for the idea. 
"This is not just to counter the liberal forces, but to avoid 
clashes within the pro-China camp," he said. Despite successes 
in the previous election, the liberals might have difficulty 
coordinating a pact to maximise their vote, Mr Tam predicted. 
"It's not easy to compromise since there are so many liberal 
factions competing." He revealed that the DAB itself was facing 
some internal friction over candidates. 
  Meeting Point legislator Zachary Wong predicted a bitter 
battle in each constituency between liberal and pro-China 
candidates. "I believe most of the constituencies will be a 
one-to-one battlefield with a pro-China and a liberal candidate 
fighting each other," he said.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zheng Guoxiong Stresses That the Chinese Side </F>
Will Never Accept the So-Called Constitutional Reform Pursued 
Unilaterally by the British Side"] 
  [Text] Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch, stressed yesterday that given the fact that the 
Chinese and British sides have not reached agreement on 
arrangements for the 1994-95 elections, the Chinese side will 
not accept any political reform proposals the British Hong Kong 
Legislative Council [Legco] may adopt. The Chinese side will 
step up "preparing its own package [ling qi lu zao 0659 6386 
3619 3501], and will reorganize the three-tier councils on 1 
July 1997 in accordance with the Basic Law. 
  After attending a New Territories Heung Yee Kuk Spring 
Festival gathering yesterday, Zheng Guoxiong answered reporters' 
questions, saying: The Chinese side has repeatedly stated that 
on the issue of arrangements for the 1994-95 Hong Kong 
elections, the Chinese side has hoped right from the very 
beginning that an agreement would be reached through talks. 
But, as everybody knows, the British side unilaterally 
announced the end of the talks and tabled the political reform 
proposals in Legco, resulting in the termination of the talks. 
In this situation, whatever resolutions Legco may adopt, and in 
accordance with whatever resolutions the three-tier councils are 
to be established, their tenures will only continue until 30 
June 1997. On 1 July 1997, the Chinese side will reorganize the 
three-tier councils in accordance with the provisions of the 
Basic Law. This is the Chinese side's firm position. The 
Chinese side will make preparations in keeping with this plan. 
He urged the people of Hong Kong to strengthen communication 
and solidarity and jointly carry out this work properly. 
  Zheng Guoxiong reiterated: The Chinese side has consistently 
taken a positive attitude toward things that have a bearing on 
Hong Kong residents. Cooperation between Guangdong and Hong 
Kong and between Hong Kong and Shenzhen in traffic, public 
order, and antismuggling operations is there for all to see. He 
said that the Chinese side adopts a positive attitude to promote 
cooperation between the two sides so as to resolve livelihood 
problems that have a bearing on Hong Kong residents. He urged 
Hong Kong residents to rest assured that the Chinese side will 
be devoted to maintaining Hong Kong's social prosperity and 
stability. 
  Asked about the financial arrangements for the new airport, 
Zheng Guoxiong said that the Chinese side is currently studying 
the fourth new airport financial proposals put forward by the 
British side. He held that the fact that Guo Fengmin, chief 
representative to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, recently 
proposed first holding a meeting of the expert group of the 
Airport Committee is a responsible attitude and a pragmatic 
practice. He said that if the two sides hold Airport Committee 
meetings on the basis of the expert group's studies, they are 
heading forward in the direction of resolving problems.

  [Text] Paris, February 16 (XINHUA) -- French Senate 
president Rene Monory today expressed the hope that Paris and 
Beijing will further develop their equal and mutually beneficial 
cooperation in politics, economy, science, and culture. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, Monory, who will pay an 
official 
visit to China on February 22-27, said that his trip will aim to 
"further improve our relations, especially economic, financial, 
and political, which have now entered an active and positive 
phase." 
  Monory will be the first French Senate president to visit 
China since the two countries established diplomatic ties 30 
years ago. 
  Noting that he had recently met with Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur on Franco-Chinese relations, Monory stressed that "the 
french government has declared that there will be no more arms 
sales to Taiwan," and that this expresses "the government's 
intention to develop friendly economic and political ties with 
China." 
  He added that he fully supports the government's position. 
  Monory said that France, as a major European country, should 
play an active role in promoting political and economic ties 
between China and Western Europe. 
  Monory said he believes there is great potential for 
Franco-Chinese cooperation, and China's rapid economic growth is 
also in the interest of Europe. 
  He said he will attempt to give medium and small enterprises 
in France a full picture of China's opening policy and economic 
situations after his return in order to expand bilateral 
cooperation beyond large enterprises and big projects. 
  Monory visited China in 1988 when he was the French minister 
of national education.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has approved plans for the first Taiwan-run 
school in mainland China at Shenzhen. But the unofficial wink 
at the new primary school -- intended for the children of Taiwan 
investors in the area -- was obtained only on condition that the 
Shenzhen government appoint the headmaster. 
  Taiwan's national flag and song will be forbidden. Set to 
open next year with about 200 students, the school has become a 
symbol of the sensitive nature of cross-straits relations. 
  The head of Shenzhen's Taiwan business association, Wu 
Sheng-shun, spent a year convincing Beijing that primary schools 
were no threat to communism. 
  "I told them that up to lower middle school, education has 
no 
political implications," he said. 
  The school will be allowed to use Taiwan teachers and 
schoolbooks, provided they are screened beforehand. But Beijing 
has warned that teachers must avoid spreading "political and 
ideological influences". 
  Wu needed longer to convince Taipei, where education 
officials feared the pupils might be polluted by communism. But 
last week he won guarantees that the students would be able to 
enter middle school in Taiwan automatically, without any testing. 
  In a symbolic tit-for-tat, Taipei demanded assurances that 
the mainland teachers at the school would not teach simplified 
Chinese characters, which the Communists introduced to fight 
illiteracy. 
  Education is not the only reason for setting up the Shenzhen 
school, which will be enclosed in a compound with 210 luxury 
homes for the families of students. 
  Taiwan investors on the mainland, especially those in 
Guangdong, have suffered from countless kidnappings, robberies 
and beatings in recent years. Security and comfort will be 
assured inside the fortified compound. 
  "I've been living in my factory ever since I came here six 
years ago," said Wu, whose company makes bicycles. "There's 
nowhere else safe at the moment." 
  After the school is built, at least some of the 10,000-odd 
Taiwan managers and technicians working in Shenzhen and Dongguan 
will find safety in numbers. "We'll all be together. That's 
one of the main benefits," Wu said. 
  But, to Beijing, that is one of the dangers. The 
establishment of Taiwan-run organisations in the mainland has 
long been blocked for fear they may become touchstones for 
pro-Nationalist, or at least anti-Communist, sentiments. Taiwan 
business groups are required to have a mainland Chinese as head. 
  Beijing's approval for the Shenzhen school appears to be 
part 
of its courtship of Taiwan investors, many of whom are reluctant 
to bring their wives and children to the mainland. 
  Wu says it was the lure of more Taiwan investment that won 
the school the support of the head of the Chinese Communist 
Party's Taiwan Affairs Office, Wang Zhaoguo, whom he met in 
November. 
  "I told him that if you want to improve conditions for 
Taiwan 
investors, you had better pay attention to the Taiwanese men in 
their thirties and forties, whose children are still young," Wu 
said. 
  Taiwan officials, led by the secretary-general of Taiwan's 
Straits Exchange Foundation, Li Ching-ping, will visit the 
mainland next month to discuss primary schools with Beijing. 
  Wu says if the Shenzhen school proves a success, other 
mainland cities could have Taiwan-run primary schools.

  [Text] Chengdu, February 16 (CNS)--Director of the Sichuan 
Provincial Taiwan Affairs Office, Mr. Li Xiyan, speaking in an 
interview with this agency, said that the province was expected 
to make new breakthroughs in its cooperation with Taiwan in the 
fields of economy, trade, science and technology this year. 
  According to Mr. Li, with the environment for investment in 
the province gradually improving, Sichuan has seen an increasing 
number of Taiwan businessmen investing in the province in recent 
years with some 426 Taiwan-funded enterprises being newly set up 
last year alone. The province now has a total of 800 
enterprises of this kind with contracted investment value of 
U.S.$850 million, U.S.$520 million of this in Taiwan funds. 
  Mr. Li said that Taiwan investment in the province had 
shifted from single items to whole-pieces of land development. 
Taiwan businessmen recently joined efforts with the Chengdu 
municipal government in developing a piece of land of 1,000 mu 
in an industrial development zone set up for Taiwan businessmen 
and another industrial town designed for foreign businessmen has 
received investment of U.S.$2.8 million from Taiwan. In 
addition, a commercial group in the island has worked out its 
development programme in Sichuan and a considerable amount of 
Taiwan capital will be seen entering Sichuan's market. 
  According to Mr. Li, the province has attracted a number of 
big enterprises and financial groups from Taiwan to invest in 
Sichuan, including an enterprise group with U.S.$ 40 million 
registered in the province for businesses in Leshan City, 
Wenjiang County and Xindu County. 
  Mr. Li said that Sichuan would this year see its 
Taiwan-funded enterprises grow to 1,000 and their contracted 
capital to U.S.$1 billion and at the same time, it would 
continue to encourage its nearly one million people who have 
relatives in the island to make every effort in introducing 
Taiwan capital and increase the enterprises invested by them to 
4,000. 
  Mr Li said that besides its economic and trade ties with the 
island, Sichuan would also expand its cooperation with Taiwan in 
science, technology, culture and education this year.

  [Text] Nanchang, February 16 (CNS) -- Taiwan compatriots 
who paid hometown visits to Jiangxi last year donated a total 
amount of close to RMB 10 million [renminbi] for various kinds 
of social undertakings, according to incomplete statistics. 
  Jiangxi saw the greatest number of Taiwan residents paying 
hometown visits there last year, totalling some 40,000, since 
the Taiwan authorities relaxed restriction on hometown visits to 
the Mainland. They were all pleased with the economic build-up 
which was underway and made up their minds to make contributions 
to social undertakings, including the opening of schools, 
construction of bridges and village roads, improvements of the 
power supply, the funding of a home for the elderly and the 
planting of trees. A Taiwan compatriot originating from Leping, 
a place in Jiangxi, donated to a fund for the construction of a 
primary school in his village because of its backwardness in 
education when compared with the economic development there. 
  A total of 45 Taiwan compatriots witnessing the building of 
a 
bridge over the Ganjiang River during their home visits donated 
a total of RMB 300,000 to fund the construction. Ganzhou 
Prefecture saw total donations valued at RMB 1.86 million made 
by 183 Taiwan compatriots last year to fund 91 social 
undertakings. 
  Various levels of local governments in Jiangxi expressed 
their gratitude to these Taiwan compatriots and presented them 
with certificates praising their generosity. Items funded by 
donations by Taiwan residents were carried out in keeping with 
the willingness of these donors.

<F P=106> [Report on a news conference held by Taiwan President Li </F>
Teng-hui with unidentified correspondents at Taoyuan Chiang 
Kai-shek International Airport on 16 February; from the "Hookup" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted containing reporter's summary 
of Li Teng-hui comments] At present, after the end of the Cold 
War, the international situation, especially the international 
economic situation, has gradually shifted toward regional 
cooperation. The further establishment of regional economic 
relations under these circumstances is a matter of great 
importance. There should be an exchange of views between the 
leaders of countries in the Asian region and the Republic of 
China [ROC] with regard to the various countries' conditions and 
their attitudes toward what the ROC thinks and does. This will 
be a great help to us. During my eight-day vacation trip, there 
were many difficulties caused by the absence of diplomatic 
relations. Despite these circumstances, after talking with and 
hearing the officials' views, especially from the leaders of the 
three countries, my conclusion is that the visit has yielded 
fairly good results. It is very important for our efforts to 
further establish relations of multilateral economic cooperation 
in the Asian region in the future. 
  Through our current visit, we can see that all countries' 
views, sentiments, and respects to the ROC in Taiwan are more 
than we can imagine at home. This is a very happy thing. 
Although we met with many unnecessary interferences in the 
course of our visit to the three countries, we handled those 
matters in a very serious manner. We are convinced that the 
whole world will gradually understand that the ROC is a 
progressive country, a country which helps other countries, and 
a peace-loving country. Our endeavors do not reflect different 
opinions toward any region or country, including Communist 
China. Our efforts to help the mainland's development and our 
efforts to help the progress and development of Southeast Asia 
are all the same. Further development of our country [women 
guojia] must be separated from the ideological field. We should 
continue to make greater efforts in the three directions, namely 
peace, cooperation, and prosperity. [passage omitted containing 
reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui comments] 
  The benefits to foreign relations through the current visit 
cannot be seen in the short term. We must patiently make 
contacts with many countries step by step. By doing this, we 
will achieve genuine results. However, we do not have a 
political agenda. Everyone should realize that the ROC on Taiwan 
must develop. It is safe to say that the ROC is a country of a 
divided China [zhonghua minguo keyi shuo shi zhongguo fenlie 
zhong de yige guojia]. The whole world should realize that a 
unified China is a goal we will attain in the future. However, 
at present the reality is that China is divided. As a divided 
country under separate rule, we should set the direction for our 
own development. This will produce greater benefits for China 
when it achieves unification. The Chinese of the world should 
not approach this unofficial visit from a political point of 
view, regarding it as something that was intended to create one 
China, one Taiwan, or two China's. There is no need to see the 
visit in this way, and quite obviously, that was impossible. 
This may be a year the ROC will develop a new direction for its 
international relations. I will visit countries with which we 
have formal diplomatic ties and countries with which we do not 
have formal diplomatic ties. It is too early now to say which 
countries I plan to visit. We will let you know after every 
preparation has been made. The country I would like to visit 
most is the United States [Li and other people's laughter]. 
[passage omitted containing reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui 
comments] 
  All the countries in the world, including their leaders and 
officials, are very pragmatic. They have their own way of 
looking at economic growth and democracy. Therefore, we need 
not worry about this issue. Nor should we adopt an unfriendly 
attitude toward the mainland simply because of its attitude. We 
shall continue to maintain our existing ties with the mainland. 
What we are doing is trying to strengthen mutual trust. We 
should continue to do so. We should tell them: Your acting like 
this will do no good to yourselves. We should use this 
opportunity to let everyone know. We should help the countries 
concerned. These countries will gradually come to realize that 
the ROC can help them better than any other country. Once they 
realize this, they will change their attitude. [passage omitted 
containing reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui comments] 
  Whether it is an achievement or not, I will be very happy if 
anything I did is beneficial to the country. My state of mind 
has not changed as a result of the visit. I would feel very 
good if I, at my age and with the last flames of a burning 
candle, could help improve the life of ordinary citizens and 
enable them to live peacefully in the country and region. It is 
not appropriate to grade myself. Nobody has ever graded 
oneself. However, I am very happy. [passage omitted containing 
reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui comments].
