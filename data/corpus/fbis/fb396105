"Espionage Case Pushes Russo-American Relations to Low Ebb"] 
  [Text]A Stab in Clinton's Back 
  A senior CIA agent, Aldrich Ames, and his wife Maria have 
been uncovered as Russian spies. This incident has caused a 
great uproar in the U.S. Government and among the public. In 
particular, the U.S. Congress sternly criticized Yeltsin, who is 
relying on U.S. political and economic support, for his 
hypocrisy and maliciousness in stabbing Clinton in the back. 
Secretary of State Christopher gave a serious warning, saying 
that this kind of practice was unacceptable. All of a sudden, 
apart from the discord sown by the Bosnia question, 
Russo-American relations have once again turned to a low ebb 
because of the Russian spy case. Now, what must be seen is 
whether or not the United States will accept Congress' view and 
take retaliatory action? How will they retaliate? What impact 
will the retaliation have? 
  The Russian Government was embarrassed by the revelation, 
but, at the same time, it openly admitted the issue and stressed 
that this was an ordinary matter which should not be overstated. 
Russia also hit back at the United States by saying that U.S. 
espionage against Russia has never stopped, but is as intense as 
during the Cold War era. Hence, Russia urged the United States 
not to exaggerate the case as if it was a political incident and 
not to "revert to the psychology of the Cold War, since making 
use of the espionage issue to vigorously stir up trouble is 
against the spirit of international partnership." (Yeltsin's 
press secretary Kostikov) 
  Ames, the arrested Russian spy inside the CIA, started 
working in the CIA in 1983 [date as published] and was the CIA's 
counter-narcotics section chief. Since 1985, from the time of 
the former Soviet Union until recently, including the period 
when the Soviet Union dissolved and Yeltsin assumed office, Ames 
had been passing secret information on U.S. espionage activities 
against the former Soviet Union and Russia and received $1.5 
million from the former Soviet Union and his Russian contacts. 
<H5>  Movie-Like Trick Used To Pass Information </H5>
  Two years ago, the FBI started a secret investigation into 
Ames' suspicious activities and discovered that, when Ames had 
gone secretly to Venezuela and Columbia in South America on 
counter- narcotics investigations, he had seized the opportunity 
to contact intelligence agents of the former Soviet Union and 
Russia. Ames also marked a post box in suburban Washington and 
dropped pieces of information so that other Russian spies could 
secretly find them by following the clue. The trick was like 
something from the movies. 
  The Clinton administration was shamed into anger after the 
case was revealed. Apart from lodging a formal protest with 
Russia, the U.S. Government also asked a Russian diplomat at the 
Russian Embassy in the United States, who was known to be 
directing Ames' activities, to voluntarily leave the country. 
<H5>  Difficult To Build Relations of Mutual Trust </H5>
  Of those people whose identities as U.S. agents were 
betrayed 
by Ames to the former Soviet Union and Russia, 10 were executed. 
In this connection, the United States considered it intolerable 
and suggested that retaliatory action ought to be taken. 
  This incident has been revealed at a time when the Cold War 
has ended and when the two former enemies of the United States 
and Russia have become allies. The KGB of the former Soviet 
Union has ceased all of its activities and the CIA no longer 
considers Russia as its biggest prospective enemy. However, the 
Russian spy case has precisely emerged at a time when the two 
countries are jointly greeting the 21st century, and both sides 
feel that it is difficult to explain away this case to their 
peoples and to the world. 
  (Stiaposen), first deputy chief of the "Russia Federal 
Counterintelligence Bureau," said at a press conference in 
Moscow as early as last month that, although the Cold War had 
ended, foreign espionage in Russia had never abated. In 
particular, U.S. and British intelligence agents have been 
capitalizing on Russia's economic difficulties to recruit a 
large number of Russians, including officials, to gather 
information for the United States and Europe. Over the past 
year, a total of 20 Russians recruited by the CIA have been 
arrested. He said that Yeltsin was aware of these cases. 
  The United States and Western Europe were displeased with 
Russia's announcement that it was to interfere and send troops 
to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now, the Russian spy case will make it 
more difficult for the United States and Russia to build 
relations of mutual trust.

  [Text] Moscow, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today that the case of a former 
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer should not be 
politicized and highlighted as a major issue in relations 
between the two countries. 
  Kozyrev spoke during an interview with the ITAR-TASS news 
agency, commenting on the arrest of Aldrich Ames and his wife 
who are accused of spying for Russia and the former Soviet Union 
for nine years. 
  The case should be left to the decision of relevant special 
agencies, the foreign minister said. 
  He expressed regret over the incident, but added that such 
cases occur all the times between countries, even between member 
states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and between 
the United States and Israel. 
  He stressed that the partnership between Russia and the 
United States has reached a high level and will not be affected 
by such a spy case. 
  He hoped that the American couple's case would not be 
related 
to President Boris Yeltsin's latest initiative for settling the 
Bosnian crisis. 
  It is inadvisable to turn the case into a political and 
ideological scandal, he said. 
  It has also been reported that the CIA will soon send a 
delegation to Moscow to work out a solution to the issue with 
the Russian Intelligence Agency. 
  Ames, chief of the Soviet branch of the CIA's 
Counterintelligence Group during 1983-1985, allegedly sold 
information about CIA operations and personnel for more than 1.5 
million U.S. dollars. 
  The Clinton administration lodged a strong protest over the 
case and warned that Russian diplomats involved in the case 
would be punished.

4801): "United States Readjusts Its Bosnia-Herzegovina Policy"] 
  [Text] Washington, 19 Feb (RENMIN RIBAO)--On the eve of 
the deadline set by the ultimatum the NATO served on the Bosnian 
Serbs, U.S. President Clinton gave a nationwide televised speech 
on 19 February, elaborating U.S. interests in and its policy on 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict. 
  U.S. policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina experienced a major 
change over the past two weeks. Originally the United States 
objected to any attempt to exert pressure on the Moslem 
"victims," maintaining that the arms embargo on the Bosnian 
Moslems should be lifted. But now the United States has changed 
its mind, asking the Moslems to give up armed resistance and 
accept the offer to open negotiations in pursuit of a solution 
to the dispute. It was originally opposed to the peace plan 
based on a partition between the Serbs and Moslems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but now it has begun to persuade the Moslems 
to accept the partition plan. Originally the United States had 
always maintained a hard line against the Bosnian Serbs and 
stressed the need for sanctions and military action against 
them, but now it has suggested that the United Nations lift step 
by step the economic sanctions against the Serbs. 
  After the NATO summit, especially after the tragedy caused 
by 
the bombing of civilians in Sarajevo on 5 February, the 
settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict has become a more 
and more pressing need. The further extension of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina war will inevitably impaired NATO's 
reputation to an extreme extent, and will be unfavorable to the 
efforts to consolidate relations between the United States and 
its European allies as well. So U.S. policymakers have begun to 
consider a readjustment of their Bosnia-Herzegovina policy. 
They have changed some hardline measures that used to be 
practiced in the past, and started playing a more active part in 
seeking a solution to the issue. Clinton's speech serves as a 
concrete indication of this change, and it has also clearly 
defined the orientation of the updated U.S. policy toward 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  First of all, in his speech Clinton stressed that the United 
States, as the only existing superpower, cannot give up its 
leadership over global affairs, and its involvement in the 
settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict is in line with 
U.S. interests. The U.S. policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina has 
undergone several stages since Clinton assumed office at the 
White House last year. At first, the United States proposed 
lifting the arms embargo on the Moslem armed forces, which was 
vetoed by European countries. After that, the United States sent 
airplanes on the mission aimed at ensuring the delivery of 
relief supplies to the people in distress. Later on, it 
advocated an air raid operation against the Serb armed forces, 
which was given up, again because of British and French 
opposition. For quite a while, the stance taken by the United 
States had made an impression on Europe that it was looking on 
at others' trouble with indifference. Now that the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is further deteriorating and Britain and 
France have shown a greater flexibility on the air raid 
proposal, the United States will lose its leadership over the 
NATO if it still keeps looking on at the conflict with 
indifference. Under such circumstances, the United States needs 
to readjust its Bosnia-Herzegovina policy. 
  Second, the United States, while wanting to retain its 
leadership over global affairs, does not want to be involved too 
deeply in the conflict in Europe. In his speech Clinton 
stressed that Europe "must assume the major responsibility" for 
settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict. The protracted 
Cold War has very much worn out the United States. Nowadays it 
can no longer meddle or directly play a part in regional 
conflicts wherever it wants to as it once did. Therefore, more 
and more Americans maintain that they should first deal with 
domestic problems. And this tendency has been highlighted in 
the Clinton administration's Bosnia-Herzegovina policy. The 
United States will take a more cautious attitude toward direct 
military involvement abroad in particular. In his speech 
Clinton emphasized the United States has not dispatched and is 
not intending to dispatch any ground force to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Third, while dealing with the European security issue, the 
United States needs to properly handle its relations with Russia 
as well. For the moment, despite the many economic difficulties 
it is facing, Russia remains quite influential militarily and 
politically. Recently, in assuming a dominant posture, Russia 
first managed to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the 
conditions set by the NATO in the ultimatum and withdraw their 
heavy arms from Sarajevo or turn them over to the UN 
peacekeeping forces. After that, Russia decided to send troops 
to join the U.N. peacekeeping force in their Bosnia- Herzegovina 
mission. Russia's moves have shown the world that the 
settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict would be 
impossible without Russia's participation. The Clinton 
administration, surprised at Russia's act at first, could not 
but give it a welcome with reservations afterward. In his 
speech President Clinton said: Russia has made an important 
contribution to bringing forth a change in the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to analyses by the U.S. press, in adjusting its 
Bosnia- Herzegovina policy and changing its mind to support its 
European allies' partition plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
Clinton administration's greatest expectation is that all the 
parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina will achieve a sustained armistice 
under the threat of the NATO's ultimatum, so that the United 
States will be exempted from direct military involvement in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-President Rong Yiren met with Sakhat Muradov, chairman of 
the Grand National Assembly of Turkmenistan, and his party here 
today. 
  Rong welcomed the delegation led by Muradov visiting China. 
  Muradov said his delegation were impressed deeply during 
their five-day trip. 
  He believed that China had made impressive progress in the 
fields of education, natural science and the humanities. 
  Rong said China and Turkmenistan, with their parliaments, 
enjoy good relations. The 1992 tour of China by Turkmenistan 
President Saparmurad Niyazov had remarkably promoted the 
development of Sino-Turkmenistan relations. 
  He said the visits of high-level leaders between the two 
countries were important for the expansion of bilateral 
relations. 
  He expressed the hope that leaders of the two countries will 
increase their contacts in order to enhance the friendly 
cooperation concerning politics, economy, culture and other 
aspects. 
  Rong extended greetings from President Jiang Zemin and 
himself to President Niyazov through Muradov. 
  He also briefed the visitors on China's economic development 
and reform of the education system. 
  Muradov said that Turkmenistan is now on the independent 
path 
of development while learning from foreign experience. So his 
delegation visited the economic development zone and bonded zone 
in Tianjin, an important industrial city in north China. 
  He hoped bilateral relations in the fields of economy, 
science, culture and education will be developed through more 
exchanges between the two countries' leaders. 
  Also taking part in the meeting was Meng Liankun, chairman 
of 
the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee of the National 
People's Congress (NPC). 
  Muradov arrived here February 20 for a visit to China as 
guest of Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. 
  Muradov and his party are scheduled to leave for home this 
afternoon.

  [Text] Moscow, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin stressed on Thursday [24 February] that Russia 
should occupy a "worthy place" in the changing world. 
  Addressing the parliament on Thursday morning, Yeltsin said 
Russia's foreign policy will be firmly based on the universally 
acknowledged principles and norms of international law. 
  "For Russia to occupy a worthy place in a changing world, it 
must have a strong state," the Russian president pointed out in 
his first-ever state of nation message delivered to the 
lawmakers. 
  Yeltsin said: "Russia respects the sovereignty, territorial 
integrity and independence of other nations including naturally 
its neighbors, and demands that they do the same." 
  "The consistent advancement of national interests through 
openness and cooperation, the provision of favorable conditions 
for the internal development and continuing reforms are the main 
objectives of the foreign policy of the Russian state in 1994," 
the president said in his 110-page address. 
  He devoted part of the message to relations with the new 
independent states including three Baltic nations which border 
Russia and the cooperation within the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS). 
  He said: "Experiences show that no other country besides 
Russia can shoulder the burden of peacekeeping in the former 
Soviet space. Russia does not have the right to scale down its 
activity in protecting minority rights in the CIS and Baltic 
states." 
  The Russian president also stressed the need to further 
expand the economic cooperation within the CIS. 
  On relations with the West and other regions' countries, 
Yeltsin said: "Partnership has become a key characteristic of 
Russia's relations with other states. The new character of 
relations with the West provides favorable opportunities for a 
more effective pursuit of Russia's interests in the fields of 
security, economy, trade and business."

  [Text] Moscow, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin stressed on Thursday [24 February] that the 
Russian strategic nuclear forces will remain the major 
deterrence force. 
  Addressing the parliament on Thursday [24 February] morning, 
the Russian president said: "The strategic nuclear forces will, 
as before, remain the major deterrence form unleashing a nuclear 
war." 
  Listing the major tasks before the lawmakers in his 
first-ever state of nation message, Yeltsin stressed the urgent 
need to "ensure nuclear security of the country, equip the armed 
forces with the latest means of combat command, communication 
and armaments." 
  Due to changes in geopolitical situation, he continued, a 
major bulk of work in reforming the Russian armed forces has 
been made. 
  Their combat composition was determined, new groups of 
troops 
are being created, mobile forces are being formed, the 
strategic, tactical and mobilization plans for the use of the 
armed forces have been drafted, the number of fully-manned 
formations has increased, the president listed. 
  As a result, he pointed out, the armed forces are in combat 
capability and ensure in general the fulfilment of tasks before 
them. 
  As to the Russian troops deployed abroad, Yeltsin said they 
are withdrawn from abroad according to schedule and with due 
account of "the emerging situation."

  [Text] Moscow, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin admitted today that democratic principles are 
being discredited in Russia and political struggle is taking 
place among state officials and in society as a whole. 
  In a 110-page address delivered to the parliament, Yeltsin 
said the struggle revolves around how to further social and 
economic reforms. 
  He complained that although the country had abandoned the 
Soviet-era command style of management it has not learned to 
abide by the law. 
  "It has to be admitted bluntly that the democratic 
principles 
of the power structure are being discredited more and more," 
Yeltsin stated. 
  He urged the legislature to adopt laws enforcing "strict 
rules" on powerful state bodies, on the government itself, on 
federal state services, on the basic organization of regional 
bodies and on the status of lawmakers. 
  Meanwhile, he stressed the need to carry out a legal reform 
in Russia, pinpointing the need to introduce efficient justice 
based on strict legal and democratic principles. 
  Yeltsin also called on the people and various political 
forces to cooperate with the new Russian Constitution. 
  "It is the duty of all those who are linked with the fate of 
Russia to use this chance for renewal and stability offered by 
the new Constitution," he added.

  [Text] Moscow, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin stressed on Thursday that state management is 
necessary for Russia in promoting market reforms. 
  In a 110-page state of the nation message to the parliament, 
the Russian president said: "The creation of a system of 
regulations of market economy is not a regress, but movement 
ahead, development of the reform, strengthening of the Russian 
state." 
  Market reforms in the country are impeded by excessive 
monopolism, according to the president, who warned that 
demonopolization is not an easy process and will take 
considerable time. 
  The taxation system is also to be considerably changed. "At 
least it should be understandable and stable during a year. The 
number of taxes is to be reduced and the rules of their payment 
eased," Yeltsin said. 
  Summing up the results of two years of economic reforms in 
the country, the president stressed that the "cost of reforms 
was high." 
  The high cost of reforms which Russians have to afford is 
explained by the difficult starting situation in 1991 when the 
economy was in a very complicated state, Yeltsin said. 
  Besides, he continued, the price of the reform also 
increased 
because of the political stand-off in the country which lasted 
for two years. 
  Mistakes of state authorities in carrying out reforms 
comprised yet another reason. He accused the government of not 
working for reform, but concentrating on "solving routine 
problems."

  [Text] Moscow, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin expressed his determination on Thursday to 
continue economic reforms and said backtracking would mean a 
catastrophe. 
  In his first-ever state of the nation message addressed to 
the parliament, Yeltsin urged Russian lawmakers to lay a "legal 
foundation for Russian entrepreneurship." 
  Among most vital tasks for 1994, the president listed the 
creation of a modern settlement system, a deep reform of the 
central bank in order to create a federal reserve system. 
  Yeltsin said he will himself control the reform of the 
central bank as it is of a key importance to economic reforms in 
the country. 
  According to the president, 1994 should become a year of 
creating financial and industrial groups. He said it is 
necessary that they emerge on a voluntary basis and do not 
reanimate the old government ministries. 
  The current year should also see major changes in state 
support to agriculture, Yeltsin said, urging to carry out a real 
reform in the agro-industrial complex rather than provide 
unlimited subsidies to it.

  [Text] Moscow, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Russian Presidential 
Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov today denounced the decision of 
the lower house of parliament to free political prisoners who 
are "anti- Yeltsin opponents." 
  The lawmakers at the State Duma (the lower house of 
parliament) voted 253-67 for the resolution on an amnesty to 
organizers of the 1991 "August 19 Event" and leaders of the 
armed rebellion in the parliament building in Moscow last 
October. 
  Kostikov stressed in a statement that the decision is 
detrimental to cooperation between the president and the 
newly-elected parliament. 
  He said that the State Duma had "not learned lessons from 
the 
bitter experience of the former parliament" which was dissolved 
by President Boris Yeltsin after over two years of stand-off. 
  He accused the State Duma of "playing ruinous political 
games" and struggling for power. 
  When the president was "making resolute steps to strengthen 
the weight and dignity of Russia in the world," the State Duma 
adopted decisions which would lead to destabilization and "a 
weaker Russia," he said. 
  "This is a dangerous way," the spokesman added. 
  Meanwhile, Emil Paine, an aide to the Russian president, 
told 
reporters that Yeltsin would not approve the decision. 
  The aide described the Duma's amnesty decision as "an open 
symbolic challenge" to the president on the eve of addressing 
his state of nation message. 
  However, he said the decision would not delay Yeltsin's 
speech which is a message to "the whole society instead of the 
parliament solely." 
  Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council (the 
upper house of parliament), said in a televised interview this 
afternoon, "the public prosecutor's office and court will handle 
this issue. Lawmakers should not be involved in it." 
  Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's choice, warned that the 
freed rebels would retake their activities against the 
president, which might result in a new bloodshed. 
  However, Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Duma Committee 
on CIS (the Commonwealth of Independent States) Affairs, 
stressed that the amnesty and the memorandum on accord adopted 
by the lawmakers would "give Russia a chance to civic 
reconciliation." 
  Russian Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov expressed 
"a 
feeling of certain satisfaction" when the decision was passed by 
most Duma factions.

Thus, the Sino-Pakistani ties are an excellent example of 
mutual contacts among states. The future of Sino-Pakistani

  [Text] Islamabad, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Pakistan 
temporarily closed its embassy in Kabul Thursday [24 February], 
one day after it was attacked by angry demonstrators in protest 
against the killing of three Afghan kidnappers in Islamabad by 
Pakistan commandos. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman, when contacted, told XINHUA 
today 
that all the staff has been evacuated from the embassy after 
Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali left Kabul 
Thursday. 
  "Nobody remains in the embassy in Kabul," he said. 
  Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, who paid a brief 
visit to Kabul on Wednesday and Thursday, is expected to give 
more details this afternoon at a press conference about his 
visit and the closure of the Pakistan's embassy in Kabul. 
  "The present condition of the chancery in Kabul is such that 
it cannot serve as a diplomatic mission till major repair and 
maintenance is carried out," said a foreign office statement. 
  On Wednesday, several embassy employees were beaten and part 
of the facility set on fire during a violent anti-Pakistan 
demonstration by hundreds of Afghans. 
  They protested against Monday's killing of the three armed 
Afghans who had hijacked a school bus and held over 70 children 
and teachers hostage, demanding ransom, food supply to 
Afghanistan and opening of Pak-Afghan border.

  [Text] Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is currently 
visiting Japan, held separate meetings with Kosaku Inaba, 
chairman of Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Gaishi 
Hiraiwa, chairman of Japan Federation of Economic Organizations 
[Keidanren], on the afternoon of 23 February. He also attended 
a welcome reception held by Keidanren. 
  In his meeting with Chairman Kosaku Inaba, Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji said as follows: My visit to Japan this time is a very 
timely one. This is an important year for China's economic 
reform, and our Japanese friends are very interested in the 
Chinese economic situation. One of the purposes of my visit is 
to introduce the economic situation in China to our Japanese 
friends. Market prices of goods and [word indistinct] are all 
stable in China. This is a very important year for Japan as 
well. Reportedly, the Japanese Government is planning to 
stimulate economic growth by introducing several important 
measures. It is necessary for Japan and China to exchange 
opinions in a timely manner to promote bilateral cooperation. 
  In response, Chairman Inaba said: When the delegates from 
the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry visited China last 
year, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji made a proposal for us to send a 
delegation to China each year. We accepted the proposal and 
decided to visit cities in the central and western regions of 
China this year. 
  Moreover, in his meeting with Keidanren Chairman Gaishi 
Hiraiwa, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said that Keidanren has been 
rendering great services to the development of economic 
relations between Japan and China for a long time. 
  Regarding the economic situation in China, Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji stated: Many reform measures were introduced in China 
early this year. These measures were enacted on the basis of 
Deng Xiaoping's idea of constructing a socialism which reflects 
the characteristics of China. They have been implemented 
smoothly in the past 50 days or so. Because of this, we have 
deepened our confidence in our effort to promote reform. In our 
economic measures, we introduced the experiences of the 
developed countries, including Japan. 
  In response, Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa said: Japan is very 
much interested in the Chinese economy. Keidanren formed the 
Chinese Committee in May last year. Its purpose is to develop 
trade relations with China.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji today called on Japanese entrepreneurs to increase 
trade with China and invest more in the country's developing 
economy. 
  Bilateral trade and economic cooperation is still short of 
its potential despite Japan's overtaking Hong Kong as China's 
biggest trading partner and in 1993 China becoming Japan's 
second largest trading partner after the United States, Zhu said. 
  The value of two-way trade reached a record 39 billion U.S. 
dollars, an increase of 54 percent over 1992. 
  "But the amount of 39 billion dollars is still too small a 
figure," Zhu told a welcoming party for him sponsored by 
Japanese trade organizations in a downtown Tokyo hotel. 
  He called for improved economic ties which would benefit the 
Asia-Pacific region as well as the world at large. 
  Welcoming Zhu on a nine-day visit that began Wednesday, 
Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi 
Kumagai said Japan pays much attention to China's economic 
development, especially as it is now working hard to establish a 
socialist market economy. 
  Japan shares much in common with China because the 
administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is also 
reforming the country's politics and restructuring the sluggish 
economy, Kumagai said. 
  He renewed Tokyo's support for China's bid to have its 
membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
restored, saying China's re-entry would help promote the 
expansion of global free trade.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji said today that China will scrap its foreign exchange 
swap market before April following the recent unification of its 
dual-track foreign exchange system. 
  Zhu, also governor of the People's Bank of China, made the 
announcement in a question-and-answer session after delivering a 
speech on China's economic reforms in a downtown Tokyo hotel. 
  He explained that instead, the government will establish a 
unified inter-bank foreign-exchange market to transact money. 
  The new unitary and controlled floating exchange-rate 
system, 
based on market supply and demand, was introduced on January 1. 
  Zhu said his government will soon announce details of 
regulations on foreign currency for foreign-funded firms, adding 
that they will find no inconvenience in purchasing hard 
currencies as long as they adhere to deals already struck. 
  On the transaction of renminbi by foreign banks, he said it 
is still too early to allow them to begin such business in China 
since the country's banks have not yet transformed to full blown 
commercial activities. 
  "If we say yes over the renminbi deal now, the Chinese banks 
will cease to exist," he said. 
  He added that the government plans to change the present 
banking system and restructure all the banks, except the central 
bank and other specially designated banks. 
  "This will be done along with the ongoing reforms of 
state-owned enterprises," he added. 
  The vice premier made a cautious reference to the listing of 
stocks by domestic firms due to insufficient regulations and 
said his government is currently not considering allowing 
foreign firms to list their shares in China. 
  Zhu arrived here Wednesday for a nine-day visit and is 
scheduled to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and hold 
talks with Foreign Minister Isutomu Hata later in the day. He 
will also travel to western and southwestern Japan to take a 
personal look at corporate activities there.

  [Text] Tokyo, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Japanese Deputy Prime 
Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata met with Chinese Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji here this evening. Both sides exchanged 
views on bilateral relations in a sincere and friendly 
atmosphere. 
  After briefing Hata on China's current economic situation 
and 
the implementation of its reform measures, Zhu Rongji said: "We 
are confident that China will maintain a growth rate of 9 
percent in the years to come. In the course of reform, China 
will try to protect foreign investor's interests. We hope the 
Japanese Government will continue to encourage and guide 
Japanese enterprises to invest in setting up factories in China. 
This is also one important way to enliven the Japanese economy." 
  Hata said: "I feel relieved after listening to our 
excellency's briefing on China's current economic situation. 
The development of Sino-Japanese trade and economic ties has 
been rapid in recent years. This also demonstrates that China 
has made tremendous achievements in its economic reform. In my 
talks with leaders of other countries we have talked about 
China's economic reform. Japan will, as in the past, continue 
to support China's reform and open-door policy, and offer 
cooperation. This will not only benefit Japan and China but 
will also benefit the world." 
  Hata reiterated Japan's support for China's bid to restore 
its contracting status within the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade. 
  After the meeting, Hata hosted a banquet in honor of Zhu 
Rongji and his party. 
  Participating in the meeting and banquet were other 
principal 
members of Zhu's entourage, including He Chunlin, deputy 
secretary general of the State Council General Office; and 
Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Dunxin.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa today 
expressed satisfaction over the smooth and rapid development of 
Sino-Japanese relations, Chinese Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  In a 40-minute meeting at the prime minister's official 
residence here, Hosokawa told Zhu that his coalition government 
is pleased to see the development in bilateral relationships. 
  He added that deeper ties between Japan and China benefit 
not 
only the two countries but also the Asia-Pacific region and the 
world at large. 
  "It will promote Japan's economic recovery as well," he 
said. 
  The prime minister said be believed Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's visit to Beijing last month helped boost bilateral ties. 
  Zhu agreed that the relationship has been solidified in both 
quantity and quality, according to the ministry officials. 
  They quoted Zhu as telling Hosokawa that joint ventures 
between the two countries helped advance China's technology 
development last year which in turn would benefit Japanese 
products in international competition. 
  The vice premier told Hosokawa that China's ongoing reform 
and improved environment for investment will attract more 
Japanese entrepreneurs to do business there and hoped that the 
Japanese Government will continue its support for China's reform 
efforts. 
  Zhu, who arrived in Tokyo Wednesday [23 February] for a 
nine-day visit, said Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Hosokawa 
helped enhance bilateral ties when they met during November's 
unofficial summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum 
in Seattle. 
  He invited the Japanese leader to visit China in March, 
telling him that Beijing is already preparing for the trip. 
  Later in the day, the vice premier met Japanese Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii to discuss bilateral financial 
cooperation.

  Zhu Rongji conveyed to Hosokawa the best regards of 
President 
Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. Hosokawa expressed his thanks 
for this and asked Zhu Rongji to convey his best regards to 
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. 
  Zhu Rongji said to the prime minister: "You have attached 
great importance to the development of Sino-Japanese relations 
since you assumed office. We appreciate your efforts. 
President Jiang and you had a very fruitful meeting in Seattle 
last November. The common views shared by the two sides are 
important for promoting the development of the two countries' 
relations." 
  Hosokawa said: "President Jiang Zemin and I indeed had very 
successful talks in Seattle. I myself am looking forward to 
visiting China in mid- or late March to further promote the 
development of Japanese-Chinese relations." 
  Zhu Rongji said: "We are actively making preparations for 
your visit. You will be accorded a grand reception. Both 
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng are looking forward to 
meeting you in Beijing in mid- or late March." 
  Hosokawa said: "The Japanese Government is pleased to see 
the very rapid development of Japanese-Chinese economic 
relations and trade. Japanese-Chinese friendship is extremely 
significant. Not only is it in the interest of the two 
countries, but it also will benefit the Asia-Pacific region and 
the world as a whole. China's economy is full of vitality, and 
it is developing very fast. The development of Japanese-Chinese 
relations plays an important role in expediting Japan's economic 
recovery. During Deputy Prime Minister Hata's recent visit to 
China, our two countries reached a consensus of views on the way 
that the fourth yen loan should be extended. I evaluated the 
success highly." 
  Zhu Rongji agreed with Hosokawa's observation. He said: 
Sino-Japanese joint ventures have played a major role in the 
rapid development of Sino-Japanese economic relations and trade. 
The goods produced by joint ventures, instead of competing with 
Japanese goods, will enhance Japanese-made goods' competitive 
and exploratory capabilities in the world market. 
  Zhu Rongji said: "Ever since China embarked on the reform to 
build a market economy, the investment environment in China has 
improved significantly, and this is good for Japanese 
enterprises' investing in China and developing bilateral 
economic cooperation and trade. It is hoped that Japan will 
continue to render its support in this field. The deepening of 
the mutually beneficial and interdependent economic cooperation 
and trade between China and Japan will enhance the two 
countries' prosperity and will help promote peace, stability, 
and the development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world as 
a whole." 
  Present at the meeting were He Chunlin, State Council deputy 
secretary general, and other principal members of Zhu Rongji's 
entourage, as well as Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Dunxin.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji on Friday [25 February] stressed the importance of 
Japanese technology and know-how in helping China to modernize 
its economy. 
  He called for further Japanese investment in the country's 
booming market. 
  With a 28 percent share of Chinese high-tech imports, Japan 
is China's most important supplier of modern technology, Zhu 
told a news conference. 
  This is not only a "very important factor" for China's 
economic development, but it also benefits Japan's economy by 
strengthening the competitiveness of Japanese products in the 
world market, he said. 
  Zhu arrived Wednesday for a nine-day trip to drum up 
Japanese 
investment and support. 
  Know-how transfer through Japanese production in China is 
what benefits both sides most, said Zhu, pointing to Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Co. Ltd.'s production of heads for video 
recorders at a plant in Beijing. 
  Japan-China trade soared by 54 percent to 39 billion dollars 
last year, but it nevertheless is "still small" considering the 
potential of China's huge market, he said. 
  Zhu, who also heads the central bank, played a major role in 
the drafting of a comprehensive reform package introduced at the 
beginning of this year. 
  Since the start of Chinese market reforms in 1979, Japan has 
provided Beijing with trillions of yen in loans through its 
overseas development assistance program. Another 819 billion 
yen have been allotted for the 1990-95 term. 
  As part of the ambitious modernization program, the 
country's 
burdensome state-owned sector will be privatized along different 
lines, including selling them off to foreign companies, Zhu 
said. Already, two-thirds of them are in the red. 
  Beijing also is considering mutual stockholding as practiced 
by many Japanese companies, he said. However, for the time 
being most companies will be turned into ordinary corporations 
and not into stock-holding companies. Zhu said Beijing is eager 
to avoid the occurrence of the asset-inflated economy of the 
late 1980s that afflicted Japan. 
  Beijing hopes that a total overhaul of the tax system will 
help gradually increase the central government's revenue share 
from the present 30 percent to about 60 percent by 2000. 
  While the provinces grew rich over the last decade by 
pocketing more levies, the falling tax revenue has left the 
central government with a cumulative budget deficit of 400 
billion yen (70 billion dollars). 
  Zhu, dismissing allegations that local governments will try 
to defend their vested interests, said Beijing has their full 
support for the reallocation of tax revenue. 
  Zhu said he is confident that the Chinese yuan eventually 
will become a fully convertible currency. 
  The yuan's value has been stable since the introduction of a 
single, market-oriented foreign exchange rate on January 1 and 
"will continue to be stable," he said. 
  Zhu, who leaves Saturday for the Kansai region, has had a 
busy schedule in Tokyo meeting Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi 
Mieno, and a number of former prime ministers. He will visit 
the Kansai region to study Japanese corporate structures. 
  He indirectly warned against inviting Taiwanese President Li 
Teng-hui to Tokyo saying that "the Taiwan question has always 
been a very sensitive matter" between Japan and China.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji asked Japan Friday [25 February] for early formulation of 
its fourth yen loan program for China, officials said. 
  Zhu made the request during a 30-minute meeting with 
International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai. 
  Kumagai said China must do more on environmental issues if 
the government is to receive full public understanding on aid to 
China. 
  Zhu promised that projects to be financed by Japan's yen 
loan 
program will contain measures designed to address China's 
environmental conditions. 
  Chinese companies failing to meet environmental standards 
would not be allowed to take part in yen loan projects, Zhu said. 
  Kumagai called for Beijing's efforts to narrow the 
industrial 
gap between inland and coastal areas. 
  Zhu replied that Beijing will formulate ways to upgrade its 
traffic system in the inland area while doing its utmost to 
create new industries there, taking advantage of abundant 
natural resources. 
  Kumagai voiced hope that Japan's yen loan and other economic 
assistance will help promote industrial restructuring in China.

  [Text] Beijing has extended an invitation to North Korean 
President, Kim Il-sung, to visit the country in the near future. 
  Diplomatic sources said that while Pyongyang had yet to 
respond to the invitation, the Kim visit would help boost 
China's power as a major arbiter in regional affairs. 
  Two major heads of government in East Asia, Japanese Prime 
Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, and South Korean President, Kim 
Young- sam, are scheduled to call in on Beijing next month. 
  The visit by President Kim (Il-sung) would help cement 
Beijing's role as a mediator among the major players in East 
Asia. 
  The sources said while Pyongyang had been angered by the 
growing ties between Beijing and Seoul there was little doubt 
that Mr Kim would accept the invitation. 
  However, the sources added, if Mr Kim's health was failing 
or 
if he was too preoccupied with the increasingly ferocious power 
struggle that had broken out within the "Kim Dynasty", North 
Korean Prime Minister, Kang Song-san, would pay the visit on his 
behalf. 
  It is understood that Mr Kim II-sung was anxious to see 
Chinese supreme leader Deng Xiaoping in case the patriarch's 
health failed. 
  Despite Beijing's recent "tilt" towards Seoul, President Kim 
Il-sung and his advisers have not given up hope that 
"first-generation revolutionaries" like Mr Deng still have a 
sentimental attachment to the old "lips-and-teeth" relationship 
between the two communist neighbours. 
  According to Chinese sources, however, Beijing's major goal 
in having President Kim Il-sung arrive after the visits of the 
leaders of Japan and South Korea was to demonstrate its 
influence in East Asia. 
  Japan and Western governments, particularly the United 
States, have urged Beijing to persuade Pyongyang to put a freeze 
on, if not dismantle, its nuclear weapon programme. 
  Chinese diplomats have also indicated their willingness to 
help promote the peaceful unification of North and South Korea. 
  Diplomatic analysts said, however, that Beijing's ability to 
influence Pyongyang's policy had been diminished. 
  They said President Kim Il-sung would visit Beijing after 
the 
end of March and Kim Chong-il, probably before the summer. 
  Aside from economic aid and co-operation, President Kim 
Il-sung will probably seek Beijing's support for his son and 
anointed successor Kim Chong-il. 
  Sources said despite his avowed desire not to meet any more 
foreign leaders, Mr Deng would probably agree to see President 
Kim Il-sung in private. 
  Meanwhile, President Kim met a Chinese Communist Party 
official in Pyongyang yesterday. 
  Mr Kim received Li Shuzheng, head of the international 
liaison dapartment of the Chinese Communist Party, and her 
entourage and held talks in a "cordial and friendly atmosphere" 
the Korean Central News Agency said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said today that early 
inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) depends on whether the United States 
carries out its agreed commitments on this issue. 
  An editorial, carried by the official newspaper NODONG 
SINMUN, said that the DPRK is willing to accept IAEA's 
inspections of its nuclear sites aimed at sefeguarding the 
consistency of the nuclear security. 
  However, only when the DPRK and the U.S. reaches an 
agreement 
on simultaneous action on the basis of the commitments made 
earlier can early inspections take place, the paper added. 
  According to the principles of simultaneous action, if the 
DPRK accepts the IAEA's inspections, the U.S. should cancel its 
annual military exercise with South Korea and issue a joint 
decision with the DPRK on the timing of the third round of 
meetings, said the newspaper. 
  The editorial concluded that only after these actions have 
been implemented can the nuclear issue be fairly solved. 
  It also criticized some U.S. news media for blaming the 
failure of the implementation of the IAEA's inspections on the 
DPRK's refusal to give entry visas to inspectors. The failure 
was not the DPRK's fault, the paper said.

  [Text] Yesterday [23 February] the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] demanded that the DPRK designate the date 
of inspection of nuclear facilities before next Monday [28 
February]. 
  The statement, announced after the meeting of the IAEA Board 
of Governors in Vienna that day, noted that the IAEA is 
concerned with the fact that DPRK has been delaying the date of 
nuclear inspection, and warned that if Pyongyang fails to 
designate the date of nuclear inspection by the end of this 
month, the Board of Governors would convene a plenary meeting 
and would demand that the IAEA Secretary- General 
comprehensively (?reexamine) the issue of North Korea's nuclear 
inspection. 
  According to a report, the DPRK will not yield to pressure. 
The DPRK representative to the IAEA said that only on the 
condition that the United States make certain concessions 
[iljonghan yangbo] including the cancellation of the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise with the ROK, can the DPRK declare an 
inspection date for the seven nuclear facilities in the DPRK.

  [Text] Beijing, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman 
of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress 
(NPC), expressed his hope here today that France would be a 
partner in China's economic development. 
  Qiao made the remarks when meeting with visiting French 
Senate President Rene Monory here today. 
  He said that though China's economy has developed rapidly 
over the past years but an overall development requires the 
efforts of several generations to come. 
  "So, we hope that France would be a very good partner in the 
development of China's economy and the two countries would 
strengthen bilateral cooperation in various fields," said Qiao. 
  He noted that this year is the 30th anniversary of the 
establishment of Sino-French diplomatic ties, and generally 
speaking, China and France have conducted effective cooperation 
during the past 30 years, but there were also difficulties and 
setbacks. 
  Now that the two countries have opened up a new page in 
their 
bilateral relations, Qiao Shi said, they should make concerted 
efforts to promote the development of such relations. 
  Qiao expressed the belief that that monory's visit, which 
precedes that to be made by French Prime Minister Balladur, 
would play a good role in strengthening Sino-French 
parliamentary relations and in the bilateral relations as a 
whole. 
  Monory said that the purpose of his visit is to strengthen 
mutual understanding and create a good atmosphere for Balladur's 
coming visit to China. 
  He said that he hopes the difficult period in the bilateral 
relations will come to an end soon and a harmonious atmosphere 
would prevail. 
  He also hoped that bilateral cooperation in economy, 
education, scientific research and other fields can be 
strengthened, so as to ensure a good fresh start in the 
bilateral relations. 
  The two sides exchanged views on international issues of 
common concern. 
  After the meeting, Qiao and his wife Yu Wen hosted a banquet 
in honor of the French guests. 
  Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
NPC, was present at the meeting and the banquet. 
  Monory and his party will leave here for Shanghai tomorrow.

  [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Trade between China 
and the European Community (EC) will continue to grow this year 
as bilateral trade volume last year reaching a record high of 
26.1 billion U.S. dollars, according to an official of China's 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC). 
  The official said that EC Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan is 
scheduled to arrive here on Saturday [26 February] to attend the 
13th Sino-EC joint commission on trade and economic cooperation 
and he will also hold talks with MOFTEC Minister Wu Yi. 
  They are expected to touch on issues of bilateral economic 
and trade relations and new ways to further expand cooperation. 
  The official said that China attaches importance to its 
imports from the EC and the import volume has been on the rise 
during the past few years, with last year's trade volume hitting 
14.4 billion U.S. dollars. 
  He especially mentioned that between 1991 and 1993 China 
sent 
three purchasing delegations to Europe. 
  China purchased as much as 6 billion U.S. dollars worth of 
goods in 1993 alone, mostly technical equipment. 
  However, he pointed out, the expansion of China's imports 
from Europe is limited by the quota restrictions on China 
exports to Europe and the discriminatory moves in protecting the 
European market. 
  Last year, China had a trade deficit of nearly 3 billion 
U.S. 
dollars with Europe, he said. Traditional items, including 
textiles, light industry goods, local and livestock products and 
grain and edible oils, remain the major commodities of China's 
exports to Europe. 
  In recent years, with the increasing inflow of foreign 
capital to China, light industrial products take a larger share 
in the exports to the EC, he said. 
  During the meeting of the Sino-EC joint commission of trade 
and economic co-operation, the two sides will hold consultations 
on the restoration of China's signatory party status in GATT, he 
said. This is the first time China and the EC will have 
exchanged views on China's re-entry into GATT. 
  The official hoped that the EC could reach an agreement on 
China's restoration protocol as soon as possible. 
  It is known that there are the basis and wishes on both 
sides 
to develop bilateral economic and trade relations. 
  From 1979 to 1993, the EC's contracted investments in China 
amounted to five billion U.S. dollars, 40 percent of which had 
been poured into the productive fields of automobiles, 
telephones, glass and medicine. 
  Though the EC's investment in China is smaller than those 
from the U.S. and Japan, it increased rapidly in the past few 
years, and some large enterprises, in particular, strengthened 
their involvement in China. 
  The official welcomed the EC countries to invest in China, 
and said that China will provide favorable conditions for their 
business activities.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou] </F>
  [Text] Soured relations between Britain and China over 
Hong Kong's political future was only a minor factor behind 
British companies' failure in their bids for the Guangzhou 
subway contracts, a senior Guangzhou official said yesterday. 
  Ou Guangquan, chairman of Guangzhou Urban and Rural 
Construction Commission, denied that British companies had been 
penalised by Beijing for the British Government's stance over 
Hong Kong. 
  Guangzhou last month awarded the city's subway contracts to 
German companies which had strong backing from the German 
Government. 
  Mr Ou whose commission oversees the city's urban 
construction 
projects said economy, not politics, was the deciding factor. 
  "Our key consideration is whether their products are 
competitive in price and quality and delivery terms," he said. 
  The Germans were chosen, Mr Ou said, because of their 
Government's soft loans which carried a lower interest rate and 
longer repayment period than those provided by their competitors. 
  And British companies, the chairman added, still had an 
equal 
chance in competing in the eight remaining Guangzhou subway 
contracts which carried a total value of about U.S.$200 million 
(HK$1.54 billion). 
  These contracts covered the supply of electrical equipment, 
communications, power transformation, elevators and ticketing 
systems. 
  According to Mr Ou, the Government would soon announce the 
winners of the remaining contracts. So far, companies from 
Britain, U.S., Japan, Italy and Germany have submitted bids. 
  "We will make a decision (on these contracts) in the first 
half of this year," the chairman said. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Ou yesterday outlined an ambiguous [as 
published] transport plan for the South China metropolis 
including the second phase subway project and a connecting 
light-rail system. 
  After completion, the three networks will have a combined 
daily transport capacity of 1.2-1.5 million passengers. 
  According to Mr Ou, Guangzhou will likely finance the phase 
Il subway construction and the light-rail network through land 
sale and soft loans provided by foreign governments. 
  While the light rail system will cost about three billion 
yuan (HK$2.66 billion), cost figures for the phase II subway 
were not available yet. 
  On a related subject, Mr Ou confirmed that the municipal 
Government would begin negotiations with the Army and aviation 
authorities over the future use of the land where Guangzhou 
Baiyun airport is located. 
  Guangzhou Government announced last year that it would build 
a new international airport at Huaduo City to replace the 
heavily- congested Baiyun airport. 
  According to Mr Ou, negotiations have not yet started 
because 
the central Government has yet approved [as published] the new 
airport plan. 
  "I am confident that the army and municipal Government will 
reach a deal over the land," said Mr Ou.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yang Chengming (2799 2052 2494) and Jiang </F>
Yaping (3068 0068 1627)] 
  [Text] Pale, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- In an interview with 
reporters of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in his office on the afternoon 
of 22 February, President Karadzic of the "Republic of Serbia" 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina emphatically noted: The protracted civil 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has brought great disasters to people 
of various nationalities, and Bosnian Serbs are determined to 
achieve final peace through political negotiations. 
  Speaking on the NATO ultimatum about air strikes at Bosnian 
Serbs' positions, he said: "This is a shameful act of the 
Western countries to practice power politics and show off their 
military forces to small nations." 
  Speaking on the bloodshed in Sarajevo on 5 February, 
Karadzic 
said: It was "created by Islamic jihad warriors from abroad," 
who attempted to put the blame on somebody else. He maintained 
that the bloodshed "had damaged the process of peace talks for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina"; "it was a base action against not only 
Serbs but also Muslims." 
  Karadzic continued to stress: The civil war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has so far claimed over 200,000 lives, 
produced millions of refugees, and caused more than $100 billion 
in material damages, pulling the economy of the area back to the 
level of several decades ago. He believed that the Bosnian war 
could be ended if the international community treats all sides 
of conflict equally. 
  Karadzic said he was grateful for the Chinese Government's 
principled stand of firmly opposing foreign military 
intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina and advocating a resolution 
to the Bosnian crisis through political negotiations. He felt 
that the Chinese mass media have fairly and objectively reported 
the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and have fully respected the 
facts.

  [Text] Beijing, February 18 (XINHUA) -- A delegation from

this afternoon for a goodwill visit to China. 
  The delegation, headed by Carlos Alberto Gonzalez, chairman 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee, are here as guests of the

Affairs Committee, Gonzalez said the delegation, composed of 
members of the main political parties in the senate, was here to 
learn about China's economic, cultural and other developments 
and for its members to deepen their knowledge of the country. 
  He noted that Paraguay received with pleasure a NPC 
delegation last year and that the contact laid a basis for the 
development of relations between the two countries. 
  He expressed the belief that the current visit would help to 
promote the development of these ties. 
  Zhu voiced his satisfaction with the increasing contacts 
between the two countries in recent years, adding that China 
attaches importance to the development of its ties with Paraguay. 
  Both China and Paraguay are developing countries and faced 
with the common task of maintaining world peace and developing 
national economies, Zhu said. 
  He expressed the hope that the current visit would be 
conducive to the development of the relations between the two 
parliaments and the two countries.

  [Text] Beijing, February 21 (XINHUA) -- China's top 
legislator Qiao Shi said here today that China is willing to 
develop friendly cooperative relations with all Latin American 
nations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful 
Co-existence. 
  Qiao Shi, chairman of China's National People's Congress 
(NPC) Standing Committee, made the remark in meeting with a 
delegation from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate of 
Paraguay, which is headed by Committee Chairman Carlos Alberto 
Gonzalez, here at the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. 
  Paraguay is the only country in South America that has not 
established diplomatic relations with China, and the delegation 
is the first one to visit China at the invitation of the NPC 
Foreign Affairs Committee since the founding of the People's 
Republic of China. 
  According to an NPC official, the two sides, in a "cordial 
and friendly atmosphere", exchanged views on further developing 
relations between the two countries, especially on the 
strengthening of bilateral economic and trade ties. 
  During the meeting, Qiao briefed the guests on the situation 
of China's current reforms, opening up and economic development, 
as well as China's policies concerning foreign affairs. 
  Gonzalez expressed his appreciation over China's reforms and 
policy of opening to the outside, adding that though Paraguay 
and China have big differences in terms of population and 
territory, both are developing countries with agriculture as 
their foundation. Therefore, he added, China's experiences are 
useful to Paraguay. 
  Both Qiao and Gonzalez expressed the hope that the 
parliaments of the two countries will keep long-term exchanges. 
  Gonzalez and his party arrived here last Friday [18 
February]. Besides Beijing, they are also scheduled to visit the 
cities of Xian, Shenzhen and Shanghai.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China will further 
step up the fight against corruption so as to guarantee reforms, 
development and social stability, a senior official of the 
Chinese Communist Party said here today. 
  This year's anti-corruption drive will be more firmly and 
thoroughly carried out, said Wei Jianxing, secretary of the 
Party Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. 
  Wei, also a member of the party's Politburo and Secretariat, 
made the remarks at the opening of the commission's third 
plenary session, which lasts for a week. 
  He said that leading officials at and above county 
(division) 
levels must strictly follow the rules concerning the building of 
a clean government made by the party Central Committee and the 
State Council. 
  At today's session, the Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection set a package of five requirements for leading 
officials to keep clean and honest: 
  -- No-one is allowed to violate regulations and buy or 
change 
to imported and luxury cars, or use power to change with and 
borrow cars from subordinate enterprises and units, or collect 
money from them for buying cars; it is not allowed to buy cars 
for leading officials with loans, money gathered from people and 
funds for special projects; party and government administrations 
and units above county level which still owe wages to staff are 
not allowed to buy cars. 
  -- No-one is allowed to run against the regulations of the 
State Council on reforming the housing system and buy houses at 
prices lower than promulgated, or use power to provide 
preferential treatment for spouses, children, relatives or 
friends, or decorate private houses lavishly with public funds. 
  -- Leading officials should attend domestic public 
activities 
in a simple manner; their accommodation should not exceed the 
local criteria for reception and no special dance parties should 
be organized for them. 
  -- No-one is allowed to organize lavish activities and spend 
without restraint at occasions of marriage, funeral, change of 
jobs, birthday and moving to new housing, either for oneself or 
family members. Using public money and materials for such 
activities or earning money through these occasions are 
especially forbidden. 
  -- No-one is allowed to mis-use power and refuse to return 
public money, or buy or build houses with public money for 
oneself, relatives and friends, or engage in profitable 
activities. 
  Addressing the meeting, Wei Jianxing said that China has 
made 
big headway in the struggle against corruption since the holding 
of the second plenary session of the commission last August. 
  However, he pointed out, the fight against corruption 
remains 
a protracted and arduous task that should be unremittingly 
carried on. 
  He said investigation into and crack-down on major cases 
involving corruption of leading officials at various levels will 
still be put on top of the agenda in 1994. The commission will 
known [as received] to the public typical cases of corruption. 
  Efforts will be made further to check unhealthy tendencies 
of 
random collection of fees and using public money for overseas 
tours. 
  Problems such as officials and employees acquiring cars and 
computers through unfair means will be probed, while burdens of 
farmers will be further alleviated. 
  While stepping up the fight against corruption, Wei said 
various discipline inspection bodies should strengthen 
supervision over enforcement of the law.

<F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang and political editor Mary Binks] </F>
  [Text] A senior official from China's top advisory body 
and once the most influential regional leaders has urged local 
officials in Guangdong to keep a low profile in the Sino-British 
row over Hong Kong--expected to reach a new pitch this week. Ye 
Xuanping, the executive vice-chairman of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], urged local officials 
in the southern province to keep out of the row for economic 
reasons. He urged them to concentrate more on solidifying 
economic exchange and cooperation with neighbouring Hong Kong, 
according to Chinese sources. 
  The central government has taken a hard line against the 
decision by Britain to unilaterally implement political reform 
in Hong Kong. It has vowed to dismantle the territory's three 
tiers of government in 1997 if the reforms proceed. The threat 
has created apprehension in neighbouring Guangdong over possible 
economic ramifications. 
  This will intensify today as Hong Kong's Executive Council 
sanctions a decision by Governor Chris Patten to implement the 
remainder of his constitutional reforms. Later this week, 
Britain will also issue its account of the Sino-British 
negotiations reinforcing an end to cooperation on political 
reform. Tomorrow legislators are expected to pass the first 
stage of the constitutional reform package, to be followed by 
the gazetting of the remainder of the reforms on Friday [25 
February]. 
  By highlighting the importance of economic co-operation 
between the two neighbouring regions in his recent meetings with 
local officials, Mr Ye attempted to persuade local officials to 
side-step the Sino-British controversy over constitutional 
reform and airport financing. The former provincial governor 
said close commercial relations between the two neighbours were 
not only crucial for Guangdong's economic development but also 
contributed significantly in easing the transition of 
sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997. 
  Mr Ye was concerned that the ongoing Sino-British quarrel 
would jeopardise economic ties between the two communities and 
urged local leaders not to join the chorus to fuel the row. The 
Sino-British dispute was a diplomatic affair between the 
sovereign governments of Beijing and London, and relations 
between Guangdong and Hong Kong was a commercial one between two 
local communities, Mr Ye was quoted as telling officials. 
  Guangdong sources said Mr Ye was disappointed with some 
local 
officials' comments on the Sino-British row and was concerned 
about its effect on the development of the local economy, which 
was becoming intertwined with that of Hong Kong. Mr Ye was also 
apparently trying to prevent local officials passing resolutions 
or issuing public statements on the Sino-British dispute during 
the ongoing provincial legislative session, one Guangzhou-based 
analyst said.

Society for Studying the Yanan Spirit: "The Times Need the 
Yanan Spirit, People Call for the Yanan Spirit"] 
  [Text] We all know that it was Comrade Mao Zedong who 
cultivated the Yanan spirit and sowed its seeds in the whole 
country, turning them into flowers and fruits. Therefore, in 
today's time of great change, upholding and developing Mao 
Zedong Thought and fostering the Yanan spirit is of extreme 
importance to the great undertaking of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  At present, the CPC Central Committee calls on the whole 
party to vigorously foster the main melody of our times. What 
is the main melody? It is Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, patriotism, collectivism, socialism, 
the dedicated spirit of the masses in the process of reform and 
modernization, the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, 
and the outstanding revolutionary traditions created by the 
communists in the course of revolution and construction, 
including, of course, the Yanan spirit. Central leading comrades 
have said that grasping this main melody, emphasizing this main 
melody, and loudly singing this main melody can better inspire 
the people's enthusiasm, enhance the fighting spirit among the 
masses, concentrate the strength of the nation, arouse vigor in 
society, and push the times forward. We wholeheartedly support 
the decision by the CPC Central Committee, respond with all our 
strength to its call, and join the choir in singing the main 
melody to sing Yanan spirit more loudly, more clearly, and more 
forcefully. "We must publicize, restore, and develop the Yanan 
spirit (speech by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in 1980)," and let the 
"Yanan spirit shine forever," (words written by Comrade Jiang 
Zemin in 1990), and this is the purpose and goal of the struggle 
of the China Society for Studying the Yanan Spirit. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping pointed out in his speech, entitled "Implement the 
Principle of Adjustment, Ensure Stability and Unity," which he 
delivered on 25 December 1980, that "we must publicize, restore, 
and develop the Yanan spirit, the spirit we had shortly after 
the liberation, and the spirit with which we overcame 
difficulties in the early 1960's. We must first have confidence 
ourselves, then we can gather the masses and educate them on 
enhancing confidence." Along with reform, opening up, and the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of socialist economic 
construction, when we review these words today, we can more 
clearly see that situated in the initial stage of socialism, and 
at the time of changing the old economic system into a new one, 
we must develop the Yanan spirit all the more vigorously. 
  The theory and practice of building a socialist market 
economy is a major breakthrough in the traditional concept and 
model, a great development of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought, a 
very difficult and arduous undertaking never tried by our 
predecessors, and a brand new topic in the history of the 
development of our country. It requires us to inherit and 
develop the spirit of emancipating the mind and seeking truth 
from facts. The development of a socialist market economy is 
for the country's prosperity and affluence. Our country has 
limited strength, a weak foundation, and many difficulties, and 
this requires us to continue to inherit and develop the 
pioneering spirit which is characterized by independence, 
self-determination, self-reliance, hard struggle, willingness in 
spite of difficulties, diligence, frugality, being uncorrupt and 
law abiding, carrying out vigorous efforts in administration, 
and selfless dedication. 
  We should launch activities among young people, and take 
this 
as the key point of our work, passing on the Yanan spirit from 
one generation to the next. According to the CPC Central 
Committee's strategic arrangement, our country's national 
economic development should reach the third goal of struggle to 
basically realize socialist modernization by the middle of the 
next century, that is, by the time of the 100th anniversary of 
the nation's founding. History determines that the realization 
of this grand blueprint and undertaking, which faces the whole 
party and the people of various nationalities in the whole 
country, rests on the century-spanning youths and their 
descendants. With what kind of spirit will they meet this 
historical mission? Can they properly take over the job of 
upholding the party's basic line unswervingly for 100 years and 
ensuring long-term peace and order in the country? Can they 
ceaselessly promote the great undertaking of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and maintain a sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development of it? Can they play an exemplary role 
and educate their offspring in struggling for the great ideals 
of communism in the generations to come? This is a big matter 
which has a bearing on the future and fate of our party, 
country, and nation. Grasping this strategic duty, we must 
coordinate closely with the relevant party and government 
departments and with the relevant groups of the masses, to help 
the broad masses of young people to gradually build up great 
faith and ideals when they carry out the solemn historical 
mission, to establish a correct outlook on life and the world, 
to inherit and develop the party's excellent traditions, to 
change their own subjective world when they change the objective 
world, and to grow up as socialism-building successors who have 
ideals, morals, culture, and discipline. 
  We must care for clean government building, oppose 
corruption, and vigorously preach the noble Yanan spirit, which 
is characterized by being clean, law abiding, and selfless in 
dedication. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We have scored quite 
a result in economic construction, and the situation is 
gratifying, and this is our country's success. But if the 
social atmosphere continues to deteriorate, then what is the 
point of economic success? A change of nature will take place 
in another area and then induce a change of nature in the whole 
economy, and such a development will lead to a world of rampant 
corruption, theft, robbery, and bribery." He also pointed out: 
"We struggle for socialism, not only because socialism has the 
conditions for developing the productive forces more rapidly 
than capitalism, but also because only socialism can eliminate 
the greed, corruption, and unfair phenomena inevitably produced 
by capitalism and other systems of exploitation." Indeed, this 
is an issue which has a bearing on our offspring, on communist 
ideals and faiths, on the inheritance of good traditions from 
the party and the nation, on the quality and hopes of the 
Chinese nation, on whether achievements made by hundreds of 
thousands of revolutionary martyrs can be consolidated and 
developed, and on whether socialism can be upheld and developed 
under the current world pattern. These sincere words and 
earnest wishes of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, a long-tested 
proletarian revolutionary of the older generation as well as the 
creator and architect of the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, merit our deep thinking! Since the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, in the 
process of reform and opening up and socialist economic 
construction, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has time and again 
instructed us to do two kinds of work simultaneously, and 
equally firmly. What is the reason for the frequent deviations? 
This is a question which merits deep thinking. 
  Since last summer, the central leadership has made decisions 
and clear arrangements to launch the struggle against corruption 
and for clean government; it said the struggle would be grasped 
for a long time and spiritual civilization construction must 
really become solid. The central leadership's determination has 
encouraged the whole party and the whole people and has fostered 
confidence in anticorruption and clean government. It is 
believed that under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee 
which has Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, problems will be 
solved step by step, and, in fact, some problems are being 
solved. In order to solve these problems, the whole party and 
people in the whole country will surely make the biggest 
efforts. In this area, we should have confidence and view it as 
an important duty of our own, we must do various tasks in 
society well and propose various constructive ideas, and, under 
the party's leadership, enthusiastically serve the purpose of 
anticorruption, clean government building, and correction of 
party work style. Our party's excellent traditions, especially 
the Yanan spirit, can play an active role in combating various 
kinds of corrupt phenomena and unhealthy practices. 
  The three major work styles cultivated by Comrade Mao Zedong 
and the proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation, 
that is, linking theory to practice, fostering close ties with 
the people, and criticizing and accepting criticisms, are the 
three magic weapons ensuring that our party's purpose of 
wholeheartedly serving the people can materialize, as well as 
the main sign distinguishing our party from any other political 
party. The China Society for Studying the Yanan Spirit must 
look at how we can develop the party's three major work styles 
and overcome various kinds of healthy practices within the 
party. When these three major work styles are on the rise, the 
party will become prosperous, and this should be the irrefutable 
truth. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics has also integrated the universal truth 
of Marxism with the actual conditions of our country, followed 
our own road, and revealed the true rationale for building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics; it is a model for 
inheriting and developing Mao Zedong Thought. The theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics will surely lead 
the Chinese people to completely cast off poverty and build the 
country into a strong, prosperous, and modern nation. The 
publishing of Volume Three of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping has provided good conditions for us to profoundly and 
systematically learn from and understand Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory. Only by thoroughly grasping this scientific theory, can 
we do a good job in inheriting and developing the Yanan spirit 
and make our own contributions to building a socialist 
undertaking which has Chinese characteristics.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China's domestic 
airlines have received seven new U.S.-made Boeing passenger 
planes so far this year. 
  Sources from the China Aviation Suppliers Corporation said 
of 
the seven planes three Boeing-737s went to China Southern 
Airlines (Group), one Boeing-737 to Xinjiang Airlines, and 
another to central China Airlines; Southwest Airlines received a 
Boeing-757 while Air China (Group) received a Boeing-747. So

planes. 
  Last year China added 71 passenger planes, of which 47 were 
boeings. At the same time the China Aviation Suppliers 
Corporation signed agreements with foreign companies for buying 
or leasing 104 planes, which will be delivered between this year 
and 1998.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Beijing by the Mainland News </F>
Center: "Mainland Academics Call for Strict Prohibition of Army 
Units Engaging in Business"] 
  [Text] Recently, many mainland scholars have successively 
issued appeals, demanding that the authorities strictly prohibit 
the Armed Forces from doing business and using tax revenue to 
support the Armed Forces. Some scholars even pointed out that 
it was a serious mistake for the government to allow the Armed 
Forces to do business, and this might bring certain hidden 
dangers for mainland China. 
  Whether the Armed Forces should be supported by state 
finances and whether the Armed Forces should be engaged in 
business operations are undisputed questions in modern 
countries. However, such questions are controversial in 
mainland China. 
  The scholars held: The Armed Forces can only be "fed" with 
the state's military budget and should be supported with the 
state's tax revenue, and they must not be allowed to engage in 
business. National defense is public property that can neither 
be divided nor sold on the market; instead, it must be kept by 
the government (mainly by the central government). In a modern 
country, the government levies mandatory taxes and provides 
public property through arranging public expenses, especially 
national defense expenses. "Supporting the armed forces with 
tax revenue" is international practice. For example, in the 
United States, the armed forces are strictly prohibited from 
doing business, still less are they allowed to join hands with 
local governments to run all sorts of profit-making industries. 
This thus ensures the non- commercialization and 
nonlocalitization of the armed forces. At present, only in a 
very small number of countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand, 
are there business companies run by the armed forces. There, 
corruption in the armed forces is notorious. The armed forces 
have become special interest groups with their own political, 
economic, and military interests independent from the state's 
interests. International experience shows that allowing the 
armed forces to engage in business operations is to turn on a 
green light for corruption in the armed forces. 
  Since the 1980's, the Armed Forces in mainland China have 
been deeply involved in business activities on a large scale. 
At present, the three services, the three general headquarters 
departments, all the field armies, and all the military regions 
and provincial military districts have set up their own business 
companies without exception. These companies are making profits 
to compensate for serious deficiencies in the military budget. 
As a result, the Armed Forces have been rapidly commercialized 
and localized, and corruption in the Armed Forces has become 
increasingly serious. Military cadres are also unhappy with 
such phenomena. 
  Many investigations show that, in mainland China, the 
business operations of the Armed Forces have developed to the 
degree of their going beyond the authorities' control. Some 
military units use planes with special passes to transport 
products which should be brought under the strict control of the 
state, naval units have used their ships to engage in smuggling 
activities on the high seas, and some units have even been 
involved in the international underground arms trade. Such 
facts deeply worry mainland leaders, who found it necessary to 
ask the scholars to work out some urgent countermeasures. 
  A national situation analysis report drafted by a group from 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences put forth five major proposals: 
  --Strictly prohibit the Armed Forces from engaging in 
business operations, and suspend all sorts of business companies 
run by the Armed Forces or with the participation of the Armed 
Forces, including military-run farms. Assets may be transferred 
or auctioned. The Armed Forces must not be allowed to 
participate in various profit-making activities in civilian 
communities, and military units must not be allowed to accept 
any gifts or allowances given by local governments or civilian 
institutions. 
  --Substantially increase the military budget and support the 
Armed Forces with tax revenue. It is necessary to greatly 
increase the central government's financial capacity in order to 
feed the Armed Forces, the Police Force, officialdom, and 
teaching staff. The expenses of the Armed Forces should come 
completely from the government's financial appropriations, which 
should be sufficient to maintain the normal operations of the 
Armed Forces in peacetime. That is, the actual income of troops 
should increase at a rate slightly higher than the growth rate 
of average income of all people throughout the country so that 
the troops have sufficient money to maintain their weapons and 
equipment, quicken the depreciation and modernization of their 
equipment, and to arrange military training. In wartime, special 
appropriations should be made to make up for deficiencies in the 
military budget. 
  --Part of national defense public property should be 
produced 
through the market. Being the most important part of public 
property, national defense should be provided by the central 
government. However, some national defense materials may be 
produced by civilian manufacturers through the market. For 
example, military rations, medicines and medical equipment, 
clothing and other supplies, military airports, roads, and some 
buildings, instruments can be ordered by the military from 
civilian suppliers, and the orders may be placed through the 
invitation of tenders. The Armed Forces do not need to effect 
"self-sufficiency" in such materials. 
  --Most military industrial enterprises should be separated 
from the regular military establishment so that the Armed Forces 
can streamline their non-combat parts. Only a very small number 
of highly confidential and key military industrial enterprises 
will remain inside the military establishment. Similar 
practices should also be adopted among scientific research 
institutes serving military purposes. A ministry of military 
industry could be set up under the State Council on the basis of 
the existing State Commission of Science, Technology, and 
Industry for National Defense. It would specialize in arranging 
the development and production of weapons and military 
equipment, and the Armed Forces would become the buyer of such 
products. Under the conditions of a market economy, the new 
model should be that the central government spends money to keep 
the Armed Forces, the Armed Forces place orders and buy what 
they need, and the ministry of military industry arranges 
production. As for nonweapons materials and supplies, the Armed 
Forces should place orders with civilian manufacturers through 
the invitation of tenders. 
  --Redefine the tasks of the Armed Forces, and reduce 
excessive nonmilitary expenditure and burdens borne by the Armed 
Forces. The Armed Forces should not take part in various 
productive and business activities in the market, still less 
should they be engaged in activities of reaping staggering 
profits or reaping illicit gains, such as through smuggling 
cars, selling arms, running luxurious hotels, and speculating in 
real estate. The Armed Forces should not be involved in local 
economic construction and turned into a low- cost labor force. 
This may also increase extra financial burdens on military 
units and affect the military training of troops. 
  In the eyes of the scholars, the five proposals are 
completely correct, but they mean that major changes would have 
to be made in the sources of mainland China's military 
expenditures. First, it is not known whether the central 
government would be able to pay such a huge military bill; 
second, it is not known whether some people who are used to 
doing business by taking advantage of the Armed Forces' 
privileges are willing to give up such enviable benefits. All 
this causes people to worry about the fate of the report.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Learn From Xu Honggang"] </F>
  [Text] Xu Honggang, the name of a common soldier in the 
People's Liberation Army, has now spread among more and more 
people. A squad leader in a communications company in the Jinan 
Military Region, Xu Honggang bravely stepped forward and fought 
heroically against four odious thugs armed with knives at a 
critical time when people's lives and property were in serious 
danger. Even while suffering from 14 knife wounds, he still 
jumped off a long-distance bus and chased the thugs until he 
fainted. With a heroic deed of not fearing evil and being ready 
to take up the cudgels for a just cause, he has set a good 
example for us to follow. 
  What is equally praiseworthy, while Xu Honggang was 
suffering 
from serious wounds for the sake of the masses, some comrades in 
Junlian County Taxation Bureau, including Zhan Benfang, together 
with cadres and masses from Junlian, Yibin, and Shengchi, spared 
no effort to save him. In saving this hero, cherishing love for 
this hero, and emulating this hero, they performed a great deal 
of touching deeds causing the song of justice written by this 
hero to reverberate louder and louder. All this not only 
suggests that at a time when we are carrying out reform and 
opening up and establishing the socialist market economic 
structure, the fine tradition of the Army loving the people and 
the people supporting the Army is still thriving across Chinese 
soil; this all the more indicates that the virtue of being ready 
to take up the cudgel for a just cause has been inherited by 
most Chinese descendants. 
  The report RENMIN RIBAO publishes today relates in detail Xu 
Honggang's deeds of bravely fighting for a just cause. Frankly 
speaking, the present situation in social order is not quite 
satisfactory. In broad daylight, some law breakers have made 
trouble and endangered the people's lives and property as well 
as social tranquility. Sometimes, some people are not willing 
to save others from danger. China's reform, opening up, and 
modernization are in a crucial period. There must be a fine 
social environment for the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure and the materialization of the second-step 
strategic objective. Thus we are required to learn from Xu 
Honggang, cultivate a social mood of taking pride in and 
respecting the spirit of fighting for a just cause, and 
encourage more people to combat bad deeds and bad people so that 
the millions will work hard for the people's tranquility and 
social stability.

<F P=106> [Report by Liu Donggeng (0491 2639 5087) and Zhang Junxiong </F>
(1728 6511 7160) from Nanjing on 11 February: "Wu Bangguo, 
Huang Ju Pay Special Trip to Nanjing Military Region, Thank 
Soldiers for Rendering Meritorious Service to Shanghai's 
Development"] 
  [Text] This morning, Comrade Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai 
municipal party committee, and Comrade Huang Ju, mayor of 
Shanghai Municipality, paid a special trip to the Nanjing 
Military Region. They cordially held a forum with Fang Zuqi, 
political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region, and other 
leading comrades in which they happily reviewed the Army's 
friendship with the government and the people and jointly 
discussed matters of vital importance on double-support work. 
  During the forum, Comrades Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju first 
extended New Year's greetings to the leaders of the Nanjing 
Military Region on behalf of the Shanghai municipal party 
committee, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the people of 
Shanghai. They also extended season's greetings to all 
commanders and fighters in the military region. After giving a 
briefing on economic construction and spiritual civilization in 
Shanghai Municipality, Comrade Wu Bangguo said: Under the 
leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin at the core, the people of Shanghai have proceeded 
simultaneously in economic construction and spiritual 
civilization in accordance with the party Central Committee's 
directive on carrying out both tasks simultaneously and paying 
equal attention to both. They have made every effort to ensure 
success in both tasks. Troops in the Nanjing Military Region, 
especially those stationed in Shanghai, have contributed 
tremendously to promoting the two civilizations. Last year, the 
Shanghai municipal party committee and the Shanghai Municipal 
Government launched commemorative activities on the 30th 
anniversary of the naming of the "Good 8th Company on Nanjing 
Road," viewing such activities as an important measure for 
promoting socialist spiritual civilization. Such activities 
played an excellent role in inspiring a hard-working spirit 
among the people of Shanghai and in advancing the two 
civilizations. Partly because of soldiers' contributions, 
Shanghai has made fairly rapid progress in economic construction 
and spiritual civilization over the past two years. Just as the 
song "The Moon on the 15th of the Lunar Month" goes, your feats 
take up half the chapter of military exploits. On behalf of the 
Shanghai municipal party committee, the Shanghai Municipal 
Government, and the people of Shanghai, I would like to express 
my heartfelt gratitude to the commanders and fighters in the 
Nanjing Military Region. 
  Comrade Huang Ju said: Army units have supported the most 
difficult tasks during the most difficult periods in Shanghai's 
economic construction. Commanders and fighters were among those 
undertaking difficult tasks, such as blowing up the dam in the 
Taipu He to release the water, expanding the Yanggao Road, and 
building the Yangpu and Nanpu Bridges. Shanghai Municipality 
has a fine double-support tradition, which we should inherit and 
carry forward in the interest of greater unity between the Army 
and the government and between the Army and the people. 
  On behalf of party committees, government departments, and 
all commanders and fighters in the Nanjing Military Region, 
Comrade Fang Zuqi expressed heartfelt thanks to the leaders of 
the Shanghai municipal party committee and the Shanghai 
Municipal Government, as well as to all people in Shanghai, for 
their concern and support for Army building. He said: It was 
very heartening to see Comrades Xiaoping and Chen Yun in very 
good health [fei chang jian kang 7236 1603 0256 1660] on the 
television newscast featuring Shanghai municipal party and 
government leaders offering New Year's greetings to them. On 
behalf of commanders and fighters in the entire military region, 
please extend our regards to Comrades Xiaoping and Chen Yun and 
wish them long lives. This is the greatest wish of the vast 
numbers of commanders and fighters. Comrade Xiaoping spoke 
highly of Shanghai's work, and we were very glad to hear that. 
Shanghai Municipality has not only developed rapidly in the 
economic field but has also made phenomenal gains in 
double-support work. National defense education has been 
legislated in Shanghai. Activities launched by Comrade Jiang 
Zemin while he worked in Shanghai to encourage leading cadres to 
"spend a day in military barracks" have not only been 
institutionalized but have also expanded to include 
entrepreneurs, teachers, students, non-CPC people, and the broad 
masses. These activities have become an important means for 
conducting mass education on national defense. Shanghai 
Municipality has actively taken various measures to solve 
practical problems and render practical service to troops, such 
as resettling demobilized and retired soldiers, helping military 
dependents settle down and seek jobs, helping soldiers' children 
enroll in kindergartens and schools, assisting troops in 
training dual-purpose personnel, and improving logistical 
operations. It has done a great deal of useful work in this 
respect. Improved double-support work has greatly benefited 
military units. We are keenly aware that difficulties, however 
formidable, will not unnerve us, given the party's correct 
leadership, the worthy masses, and the Army's good relationship 
with the government and the people. It is the sacred duty of 
the People's Army to defend and build the motherland. We are 
duty-bound to carry out the large-scale construction of 
Shanghai. From now on, we should continue to do more work, and 
the Army and the people should work together to further defend 
Shanghai and carry out the large-scale construction of Shanghai. 
  Leaders from the Nanjing Military Region, Shanghai 
Municipality, and relevant departments attending the forum 
included Yan Zhuo, Xie Decai, Wang Yongming, Lan Baojing, Chen 
Bingde, Wang Tongzhuo, Wang Chuanwu [3769 0278 2976], Sui 
Shengwu, Xu Wenyi, and Zhou Yupeng. 
  Prior to the forum, Wu Bangguo, Huang Ju, and other leading 
comrades from Shanghai Municipality braved the rain to call on 
veteran comrades in the Nanjing Military Region, such as 
Comrades Du Ping, Xiang Shouzhi, Fu Kuiqing, and Liu Anyuan, in 
the company of Lan Baojing, deputy political commissar of the 
Nanjing Military Region. They extended New Year's greetings to 
the veteran comrades, wishing them good health, long lives, and 
a happy New Year.

<F P=106> [By Li Yang (2621 2254) of Chinese Academy of Social </F>
Sciences Finance and Trade Research Institute: "Establishing a 
Highly Efficient Capital Market Is an Important Part of Banking 
Reform"] 
  [Text] The CPC Central Committee's decision on building 
the socialist market economic structure set forth the general 
principle for the "sustained, rapid, and healthy" [chi xu kuai 
su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the 
national economy. Here, the necessary condition for the rapid 
development of the national economy is the maintenance of a high 
investment rate over a long period and the full condition for 
the healthy development of the national economy is that the high 
investment rate is supported by a corresponding high savings 
rate. Only when the savings rate and the investment rate are 
kept balanced can there be sustained development of the national 
economy. To put it in a nutshell, balancing savings and 
investment is the key to the implementation of the general 
principle. In China, investment demand is always brisk so an 
effective way to mobilize savings or the establishment of a 
highly efficient capital market is of greater significance. 
  In the traditional structure, there was basically no capital 
market in our country. In those years, under the centralized 
financial system, savings in the whole society were mainly 
concentrated in the hands of the government and were then 
distributed to various enterprises for the purpose of investment 
in the form of financial appropriation. This form of raising 
and using funds can be regarded as a special form of internal 
financing [nei yuan rong zi 0355 3293 5816 6357]. Since the 
beginning of the economic structural reform, with the 
readjustment of the elementary distribution structure of the 
national income, the government savings in the gross social 
savings have been gradually decreasing (and the net savings have 
now become negative), while the savings kept by enterprises and 
individuals have been gradually increasing. Being supported by 
such a savings structure, external financing [wai yuan rong zi 
1120 3293 5816 6357] has gradually come to prevail in our 
country. According to statistics, external financing accounts 
for about 70 percent of the current sources of enterprise 
investment funds. This is reflected in the fact that in the 
"cake" of state investment, bank loans and the funds raised by 
the enterprises on their own are the main financial sources. 
The rate of external financing in our country is rather high as 
compared with the between 30 and 50 percent rate in the 
countries with developed market economies. 
  The abovementioned change has caused the monetary policy to 
hold a decisive position in our macroeconomic control and 
regulation system. Signs of such change appeared in the early 
stage of reform and people could obviously see it after the 
three-year economic rectification. However, the reform of the 
financial control system did not keep pace with such change. 
This was mainly reflected in the following facts. First, we 
still maintained the traditional means of credit distribution to 
exercise financial management and it was increasingly difficult 
to effectively control the gross quantity of credit and money 
supply in the whole society by this means. Moreover, the 
distribution and circulation of credit funds in the economy 
became far distant from the subjective wishes of financial 
authorities. Second, we still used the method of managing 
credit funds to deal with the issuing of various securities by 
imposing quantitative limits on such issues. Third, we still 
lacked an effective means of managing the fund-raising 
activities launched by enterprises on their own beyond the 
direct financing under the state's control. All this brought 
about a disorderly situation in the financial field during the 
last few years. 
  It is indeed important to rectify the financial order. 
Behind various disorder phenomena there exist various types of 
misconduct and the inertial effects of the old system but there 
also exist sprouts of the new financial system. We can even say 
that many of the current financial problems are in fact a type 
of spontaneous reaction from the market economic forces against 
the ossified financial system. If we do not properly analyze 
various factors, we cannot achieve the expected results in our 
rectification efforts and China's further economic growth may 
encounter other obstacles. As we have noticed, since the 
beginning of the economic reform, major changes have occurred in 
China's economic growth mechanisms. The country's economic 
growth in the past more than 10 years was mainly attributed to 
the rapid development of the nonstate-owned enterprises, the 
expansion of the tertiary industry, and the high-speed growth in 
the coastal areas. However, such economic entities and 
industries, which made major contributions to the economic 
growth, did not hold any significant position in the state's 
credit plan; and what was actually gained by the economically 
developed areas was obviously insufficient as compared with the 
demand. This brought about a profound contradiction. On the 
one hand, economic development had to rely heavily on the 
nonstate-owned enterprises and the tertiary industry and on the 
economic growth in the coastal areas; on the other hand, the 
financial demand in such enterprises, trades, and areas could 
not be satisfied by the state's official credit plan. As a 
result, funds were "loaned" from the state-run banks to 
nonstate-owned banks, nonbanking financial institutions, 
nonstate-owned enterprises, trades in the tertiary industry, and 
economically developed areas and this became an inevitable 
trend. Because the derived financial demand was not aimed at 
adjusting the monetary position, "daily loans" were inevitably 
changed into "monthly loans," "quarterly loans," or "yearly 
loans." Because most of such loans were not allowed by the 
state, there naturally existed instances of violating financial 
discipline and funds were offered at much higher costs. Similar 
problems also occurred in the field of direct financing. 
Because many new investment projects could not obtain funds 
through official channels, it was rather common that they raised 
funds on their own in various ways without the approval of the 
administrative authorities. 
  Can we then improve the situation by means of "perfecting" 
the fund distribution method? In our opinion, this should not, 
and also cannot, be done. First, if social funds are 
distributed by the monetary authorities, this is a typical 
practice in the planned economy and logically comes into line 
with the across-the-board planned management and distribution of 
materials and funds. Such practice has now lost the necessary 
economic conditions. Second, smooth funds distribution still 
needs certain institutional conditions in the financial system: 
1) The financial institution must be large and highly 
centralized (as we had only one bank in society in the past) so 
that funds do not move in and out of the financial system on a 
large scale. 2) Social expenditure is made by entities bearing 
the same character (as in the past, the state-owned enterprises 
assumed an overwhelming proportion and their revenue and 
expenditure were totally controlled by the government). Thus, 
funds will not move between different economic elements. 3) 
There should only be one single financial product (as in the 
past, there were only simple deposits and loans in society) so 
that there will be no replacement between different financial 
products and no consequent transfer of funds. 4) The national 
economy should be closed (as we laid lopsided stress on 
self-reliance in the past) so that changes in international 
reserve and in foreign exchange rates do not produce any 
unexpected impact on domestic money supply. Obviously, all such 
conditions no longer exist in China. As the foundation and the 
conditions no longer exist, it is impossible to "improve" the 
system being established on such foundations and under such 
conditions. More importantly, when the market-oriented reform 
has been carried out in depth today, credit planning can less 
and less satisfy the increasingly active needs in economic 
development and has become increasingly a huge "rent-seeking" 
hotbed [xun zu yuan sou 1416 4436 3220 5674]. So, it should be 
terminated as soon as possible and replaced with a new mechanism 
for indirect control of the money supply. Under the new system, 
the monetary authorities should apply indirect regulatory means 
to control and adjust the gross quantity of money supply and 
market interest rates. The movement of social funds should 
mainly be directed by the profit- oriented financial 
institutions and by the securities market according to market 
signals. 
  In the new pattern of monetary regulation and control, the 
establishment of an effective capital market is an important 
task. 
  In the field of indirect financing, it is of course very 
important to organize and establish some policy-oriented banks 
[zheng ce xing yin hang 2398 4595 1840 6892 5887] but they can 
only meet the financial needs of a small number of key trades 
with a bearing on the national economy and the people's 
livelihood. It is definitely necessary to transform the 
existing specialized banks but, if long-term funds are mainly 
provided by the commercial bank, the financial demand in society 
still cannot be satisfied and the situation may become rather 
dangerous in a certain sense. This is because the funds of the 
commercial banks mainly come from the savings of individuals and 
enterprises and the mobility of such funds is rather high. 
Their liabilities constitute the main part of the money supply. 
If such financial sources are used to make long-term 
investments, a financial crisis can easily arise. This is the 
reason why the monetary authorities must require the commercial 
banks to keep reserve funds and provisions, lay down a strict 
requirement on the rate of their own capital, and exercise 
strict control over the operation of their assets. In the 
countries mainly practicing the market economy, the long-term 
funds supplied through some indirect financing channels mainly 
come from nonbanking financial institutions, which mainly refer 
to various insurance companies, pension funds, trust and 
investment companies, common funds, savings and loans 
associations, and financial companies. A common characteristic 
of these financial institutions is that they all have long-term 
and stable funds sources. It is precisely under such a 
liabilities structure that they can play a major role in the 
capital market. If our financial institutions are still not 
well developed, then our nonbanking financial institutions are 
just at the starting stage. Therefore, in order to establish an 
effective capital market, it is necessary to greatly develop 
nonbanking financial institutions and make them one of the key 
points in our new financial system. 
  In the field of direct financing, we should mainly 
substantially develop the standardized stock and corporate bond 
markets. We should be soberly aware that exercising scale 
management over the issuing of securities will inevitably hinder 
the ongoing process of adopting the corporate system in the 
reorganization of the existing enterprises and this is a 
management method which goes against the principle of the market 
economy. Only by abolishing such scale management can the 
securities market and the market economy as a whole develop 
healthily. With regard to stocks, some concepts should be 
clarified. The adoption of the corporate system in the 
reorganization of the existing enterprises certainly requires 
that existing assets be turned into a certain quantity of 
shares. However, first, this does not mean that the enterprise, 
while turning its assets into shares should at the same time 
increase its assets and shares. It is absolutely necessary to 
prevent them from trying to increase investment and neglecting 
the adjustment of the property rights structure. Second, while 
an enterprise is reorganized into a joint-stock company, this 
does not mean that its stocks must be negotiable in the market; 
even if the stocks can be traded, it does not necessarily mean 
that they should be listed on a stock exchange. After the 
joint-stock company becomes the main enterprise form in our 
country, the stocks of most enterprises should be negotiable in 
the counter market [gui tai shi chang 2681 0669 1579 1034]. 
That is to say, we can adopt certain steady steps for listing 
stocks in the exchange but it is certain that we should promote 
the development of stocks counter trade [gu piao de gui tai jiao 
yi 5140 4384 4104 2681 0669 0074 2496]. We hold that any 
enterprises, as long as they meet the requirements for issuing 
securities, should be allowed to raise funds through the market. 
Limiting the scale of securities issuance will only lead to the 
spread of irregular fundraising activities. In view of the 
abnormal situation in which the rate of liabilities in the 
enterprises of our country is too high, it is necessary to 
change the enterprise capital structure in order to thoroughly 
change this situation. To achieve this purpose, we must 
substantially develop the stock market and the corporate-bond 
market. 
  To sum up, we should make efforts to create a relaxed, free, 
diverse, and competitive financial system through carrying out 
financial reform. Only on the basis of such a financial system 
can the central bank hold a detached position to play a role as 
a referee in the competition. On the contrary, if there are 
only a small number of financial institutions and a small number 
of financial tools in the economy, they will become too 
cumbersome and will not be able to play an effective role; 
neither can the central bank play an effective role in 
exercising macrocontrol.

<F P=106> ["Random Talk on Economic Life" column; interview with </F>
Professor Meng Xianzhong (1322 2009 1813) of Jilin University 
Social Development Institute by staff reporter Zhang Yulai (1728 
3768 0171): "Improve the Quality of the State Economy"--first 
paragraph is RENMIN RIBAO introduction] 
  [Text] Recently, this reporter interviewed Professor Meng 
Xianzhong of the Social Development Institute of Jilin 
University on how to respect objective laws and promote the 
healthy development of the socialist market economy in our 
country. 
  [Zhang Yulai] Since the 14th CPC National Congress, the 
building of the socialist market economy structure has developed 
very quickly. However, some problems worthy of attention have 
cropped up, such as overheated investment in fixed assets, 
excessively fast development in the development zones, and 
excessive credit scale and monetary input. Why is it that 
whenever we talk about developing the economy, people think of 
speeding up capital construction, expanding scale, and 
increasing investment? 
  [Meng Xianzhong] All these problems reflect a long-standing 
conspicuous problem in the economic construction of our country: 
People have attached importance to the speed of the economy 
while ignoring the quality of the state economy and have been 
accustomed to the quantitative type of economy which increases 
extension while failing to meet the requirement of taking 
economic results as the center. 
  Economic development, of course, includes accelerating the 
speed of economic development and increasing the percentage 
growth of the GNP and this is of great significance. However, 
we cannot belittle the improvement of the quality of the state 
economy. In view of the present tendency to attach importance 
to quantity while belittling quality, I think that it is 
urgently necessary to make clear that to improve the quality of 
the state economy is a pressing task in building the market 
economy. 
  [Zhang] What is the meaning of the concept "the quality of 
the state economy?" 
  [Meng] All things are determined by quality and quantity. 
In the same way, the state economy is also determined by 
quality and quantity. The quantity of the state economy means 
the scale and speed of economic reality and economic 
development. The quality of the state economy is about whether 
or not the economic structure of a country is rational and 
whether or not its economic operations are highly efficient. To 
be specific, the quality of a country's economy is determined by 
various factors, such as the rationality of the industrial 
structure, the foundation and main propelling forces of economic 
development, various rates of input and output, labor 
productivity, and the amount of national income generated by the 
social GNP. 
  As viewed from our macroindustrial structure, facts clearly 
show that the second and tertiary industries are not developed. 
Therefore, we must make great efforts to develop the second and 
tertiary industries. As viewed from the industrial and 
transportation fields, structural contradictions between 
industries have become more and more conspicuous. In 
particular, infrastructure like railway transportation and the 
support capacities of basic industries are still quite weak. At 
present, railway transportation can only meet 60 to 70 percent 
of the needs of freight transport and has become a "bottleneck" 
in our economic development. To speed up our economic 
development, we are first faced with the task of readjusting the 
industrial structure to make it more rational and modern. 
  In assessing the quality of the economy from the angle of 
the 
industrial structure, it is also necessary to look at the 
internal structure of each industry. In recent years, for 
example, although the percentage of industrialization in some 
localities has been greatly increased, the industrialization in 
many localities is at a low level. This means that, although 
industrial production has become the dominant social production 
activities in these localities, the products turned out are 
mainly primary products which consume visible resources and the 
value added to them by means of high-technology and 
new-technology is quite low. They are in an unfavorable 
position in commodity exchanges. In 1992, it turned out that of 
the 500 enterprises with the best economic results, over 70 were 
cigarette plants; of the top 500 enterprises in handing over 
profits and taxes to the state, more than 90 were breweries. In 
1993, ranking first and second in the 500 enterprises with the 
best economic results in our country were also tobacco 
processing and beverage enterprises. In the United States and 
Japan, almost all of the top 500 enterprises with the best 
economic results are industrial enterprises using 
high-technology or using a large percentage of high technology. 
Only a few tobacco enterprises, Philip Morris, British American 
Tobacco, Japan, Spain, and Renault [lei nuo 7191 6179] are among 
the world's 500 biggest financial groups. [names as published] 
Besides, all these tobacco enterprises have diversified 
business. Just think, when the tobacco processing and beverage 
industries have become the main industrial enterprises with good 
economic results in a country, how can we talk about economic 
competitive power or comprehensive national strength? 
Nevertheless, some localities are still expanding the production 
of cigarettes and wine. 
  [Zhang] You said there are problems in the industrial 
structure of our country. What is the relationship between the 
foundation and propelling forces of economic development and the 
quality of the state economy? 
  [Meng] The central resources and propelling forces of 
economic development vary in different historical periods. In 
the agricultural society, land was the central resource and 
agricultural labor was the main force propelling economic 
development; in the modern society, industrial capital was the 
central resource and production with machines on a large scale 
was the main propelling force; and since the second half of the 
20th century, human capital has become the central resource for 
economic development and science, technology, and culture have 
become the main propelling forces in economic development. At 
present, 50 to 70 percent of the GNP in developed countries is 
created by the input of science, technology, and culture. That 
the input of science, technology, and culture has become the 
main propelling force implies among the input of resources, 
power, capital, labor, science, technology, and culture, that 
science, technology, and culture account for a greater 
percentage and the output of science, technology, and culture is 
high. Only this represents the level of modern production. 
China proves definitely inferior in this respect. The rate of 
industrial products contributed by science, technology, and 
culture is less than 30 percent and, in recent years, the 
percentage in a few provinces and municipalities has tended to 
decrease. 
  [Zhang] Please tell us more about the question of the 
input-output ratio. 
  [Meng] Viewed from various individual input-output ratios, 
the quality of the energy utilization coefficient, the profit 
and tax rate of capital, and the economic results of investment 
in fixed assets are low. The energy consumption of unit GNP of 
China is six times that of Japan and more than twice that of the 
United States. The profit and tax rate of capital in China is 
only equivalent to one-quarter to one-third of that of the 
developed countries. The economic results of investment in 
fixed assets in our country is even more worrying. Of the 
existing 2,200 billion yuan in fixed assets, those lying idle 
and those with a low utilization rate account for one-third, 
almost as much as 700 billion yuan. This means the economic 
result of one-third of them is very little. 
  [Zhang] It seems that a low input-output ratio implies great 
waste. Please tell me more about the level of social labor 
productivity in our country. 
  [Meng] Compared with the developed countries, the social 
labor productivity in our country is quite low. Let's take the 
auto industry for instance. The biggest auto production group 
in our country has 100,000 workers and staff members. Its total 
sales volume in 1991 was about 6.2 billion yuan. The 
accumulated number of automobiles produced since the plant was 
set up 40 years ago is less than 2 million. Japan's Toyota Auto 
Corporation has less than 100,000 workers and staff members. 
Its sales volume in 1991 was $65.454 billion. Germany's 
Mercedes-Benz has 376,000 workers and staff members. Its sales 
volume in 1991 was $54.259 billion. The number of automobiles 
turned out each year by either of the last two auto corporations 
exceeds 2 million. Just think, without a high labor 
productivity and without a good quality of the economy, how can 
we compete with other countries after reentering the GATT. 
  What is especially worthy of our attention is that in recent 
years, although the output value of some provinces and 
municipalities has grown very fast, the labor productivity has 
fallen. This shows that the economic growth of these provinces 
and municipalities is the outcome of a high input of manpower, 
financial resources, material resources, and energy resources 
instead of raising the labor productivity. It should be pointed 
out that this kind of high output and high speed have covered up 
the fall in the labor productivity. 
  [Zhang] It seems that without improving the quality of the 
state economy, it will be difficult to increase our economic 
strength and the comprehensive national strength, or to compete 
with other countries. In particular, the per capita possession 
of reserves of major minerals, clean water, farmland, forests, 
or pastoral land in our country is below the world's per capita 
level and the per capita possession of nonregenerated energy 
reserves is also below the world's per capita level. If we 
blindly seek a high output value and a high speed by means of a 
high input, we shall inevitably damage the conditions for 
sustained production and the capacity to expand reproduction. 
  [Meng] It is precisely so. Let us look again at the 
question of the formation of the national income by the social 
gross output value. This question has a bearing on the final 
economic results. In the 1950's, 100 yuan of social gross output 
value resulted in over 50 yuan in national income. However, in 
the 1980's, the amount went down to just over 30 yuan instead of 
going up. This shows clearly that the quality of our economy 
urgently needs improvement. 
  In short, developing the economy by improving the quality of 
the state economy or one-sidedly developing the economy by a 
high input and a high consumption rate are two different ways of 
thinking which will lead to two different results and prospects. 
We should never overlook this. During his inspection tour of 
the south at the beginning of 1992, Deng Xiaoping, while 
stressing the necessity of quickening economic construction, 
explicitly pointed out: It is necessary to pay attention to 
quality, economic results, and the export-oriented type 
enterprises and "to develop the economy faster, we must depend 
on science, technology, and education." In the report from the 
14th CPC National Congress, it is also explicitly pointed out 
that the economic construction of our country should realize two 
kinds of transition. One is the transition from the planned 
economy structure to the market economy structure and the other 
is the transition from a quantity-type economy to an economic 
result-type economy. Many of us have paid attention only to 
speeding up the development of the economy while overlooking the 
necessity of depending on science, technology, and education to 
develop the economy. At present, the people have a greater 
awareness of the transition to the market economy but their 
awareness of the transition to an economic result-type economy 
is still very vague. 
  [Zhang] How do you think the quality of the state economy 
can be improved? 
  [Meng] Consumers should have awareness of the quality of 
commodities, enterprises should have awareness of the quality of 
the products, and the leadership at all levels should have 
awareness of the quality of the state economy. To the 
leadership at all levels, awareness of the quality of the state 
economy is the most important awareness of the economy. The 
improvement of the quality of the state economy is a system 
engineering project and there is much work to do in this 
respect. The most important thing is to depend on improving the 
quality of the national science, technology, and culture and on 
training capable personnel.

  [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- China is relying on 
property rights reform to invigorate its many state-owned 
enterprises in its drive to establish a market economy. 
  Medium-sized and small enterprises with less than desirable 
management and profits are being sold, transferred or merged 
with others, said Jia Heting, deputy director for the Production 
System Department under the State Commission for Economic 
Restructuring (SCER). 
  He said 10,000 enterprises in the country underwent such 
reforms last year. Two thousand nine hundred medium-sized and 
small enterprises in China's 16 large cities were sold or 
merged, and property rights worth 6 billion yuan (about 1 
billion U.S. dollars then) were effectively made productive. 
More than 400,000 employees were offered other jobs, according 
to Jia. 
  These cities include Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and 
Shenzhen. 
  "Such property rights reform helps to optimize the 
allocation 
of state assets in the socialist market economy," said Jia 
Heting. 
  More and more enterprises from different regions or trades 
are being merged, instead of only those from within the same 
regions or trades, Jia said, adding that enterprises in 
Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing are taking over others by buying 
up their stock. 
  To transfer property rights, some enterprises agree to 
shoulder old debts, or pay in cash immediately, he said. 
  The SCER official said a major move in the property rights 
reform--the share-holding system--is gaining ground in China. 
More and more pilot companies are going public, and nine 
enterprises have been chosen to issue stocks in Hong Kong. 
  There are 3,800 pilot stock companies in China, Jia said. 
  China has promulgated a series of laws and regulations to 
govern property rights reform, which include the Bankruptcy Law, 
the Corporate Law, and the provisional regulations on enterprise 
mergers, on management of state assets, on selling the property 
rights of small enterprises and the assessing of state assets. 
  Economists expect large and medium-sized state enterprises 
to 
be transformed into stockholding enterprises, while small state 
enterprises will be turned into non-state but publicly owned 
enterprises through auctions or rental arrangements. 
  The large state enterprises will absorb non-state funds from 
the market, and new state assets can be formed through stock 
issues and creating income through investing in weak points of 
the national economy, experts said.

  [Text] China still faces problems implementing its 
financial reforms, according to a senior official of the Bank of 
China. 
  Bank vice-chairman Huang Diyan yesterday said difficulties 
included managing the bad debts arising from policy-driven 
lending, and maintaining a stable yuan. 
  In a speech on China's financial system, Mr Huang, who is 
also the chief executive of the bank's Hong Kong-Macao Office, 
said inherent problems were a result of the wide exposure of the 
reform measures. 
  "Their success will mainly depend on transformation of the 
mechanism of state-owned enterprises, and a healthy fiscal 
system," he said. 
  Mr Huang said the latest financial reforms were the most 
thorough in China over the past 15 years. China, since January 
1, has launched a series of financial reforms on exchange rates 
and taxation, following the economic austerity programme 
introduced last July in a bid to rein in the country's heated 
economy. 
  He said the current financial system had problems which had 
not been touched by previous reforms. They included a confusion 
of responsibilities among financial institutions that limited 
their ability to tune the economy, and an incomplete financial 
regulatory framework, which had led to a proliferation of 
lending. 
  He also pointed to the limitations of interest rates as a 
tool of regulating the demand for funds. 
  The latest reforms, gave the People's Bank of China greater 
authority over note issue, monetary management, credit 
adjustment, foreign exchange policy and interest rates, 
strengthening its role as a central bank. 
  The reforms also took away the responsibility for 
policy-driven decisions from the four specialist banks, which 
include the Bank of China, freeing them to act as commercial 
banks.

  [Text] Shanghai has unveiled an ambitious and 
comprehensive plan to replace Hong Kong as the most important 
financial centre in Asia over the next 15 years. 
  Measures include persuading all Hong Kong-based red-chip 
conglomerates to relocate their headquarters to Shanghai, 
opening doors to foreign brokerages and rating agencies and 
setting up various specialist short-term fund markets. 
  Shanghai, which outshone Hong Kong in the 1940s, has long 
been talking about regaining its past glory. But this is the 
first time that the city has come up with concrete measures to 
match its words. And it has enlisted an important ally in the 
People's Bank of China. 
  The country's central bank had urged the government, in a 
comprehensive report, to allow Shanghai to realise its dream by 
the year 2010, the Beijing-backed HUANAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL 
reported yesterday. 
  The newspaper did not say how the government had responded 
to 
the report. 
  According to the People's Bank report, Shanghai would try to 
persuade the Hong Kong- and Beijing-based China Merchant Group, 
China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC), 
China Everbright Group, Bank of China and others to relocate to 
the city. 
  It would also try to get all the new national financial 
institutions to set up bases in the city, and the People's Bank 
would like to station a deputy governor permanently in Shanghai. 
  In an attempt to link-up with international financial 
markets, the city would allow foreign brokers or joint-venture 
brokerages into the Shanghai Stock Exchange. 
  Two international rating agencies, possibly Moody's and 
Standard &amp; Poor's, would be allowed in to assess Chinese 
companies for domestic and international listings. 
  The city would soon abolish restrictions to allow free trade 
in A and B shares. At present A shares are traded solely by 
domestic shareholders while foreign investors can only trade B 
shares. 
  Shanghai would step up efforts to attract foreign banks, 
insurance companies and other financial institutions, and 
broaden its business scope. Foreign banks have been lobbying 
for the right to accept yuan deposits from mainlanders, whose 
savings in Chinese banks total 1.4 trillion yuan (about HK$1.243 
trillion). 
  The city plans to set up several specialist short-term fund 
markets in the hope of linking with other international 
financial markets. 
  These include markets for commercial notes, inter-bank 
borrowing, short-term loans, bank discounts, one-year Chinese 
state-treasury bonds, Euro money and international currencies. 
  The Shanghai bourse plans to expand its issues of new stocks 
and bonds in a bid to increase its market turnover to 65 percent 
of national volume by the end of next year. In the short term, 
it plans to increase its membership to 800, with 3,000 trading 
seats. 
  To attract foreign investors, the city would introduce more 
financial instruments such as foreign-currency and interest-rate 
options, share buy-back arrangements, convertible bonds, mutual 
funds and loan securitisation. 
  A report in the Beijing-controlled Hong Kong newspaper, TA 
KUNG PAO, said yesterday that about six international companies, 
including Mercedes-Benz, were still negotiating for secondary 
listings in Shanghai, and a breakthrough was expected this year. 
  The report said the Shanghai exchange was negotiating to buy 
a telecommunications satellite.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "11 New Firms To Go Public in Shanghai"] </F>
  [Text] Eleven new firms are expected to be listed on the 
Shanghai Stock Exchange today, boosting the number of A-share 
companies on the market to 139. 
  The shares the 11 firms put in circulation will have a total 
face value of 169.85 million yuan ($19.523 million). 
  Seven of the new companies are from Shanghai. They are: 
Shanghai Shangling Electric Appliance, Shanghai Jielong 
Industry, Shanghai Lingqiao Water Plant, Shanghai Commercial 
Real Estate Development, Shanghai Oriental Pearl, Shanghai No. 9 
Department Store, and Shanghai SAIC [expansion unknown] Multiple 
Trading. The other four are Huanghe Machinery and Electrical 
from Xian, Shaanxi Province; the Chengdu People's Shopping 
Centre from Sichuan; the Harbin Tianer Industry from 
Heilongjiang; and Ningbo Chenghuangmiao from Zhejiang. 
  Officials expect the value of new shares listed on the 
exchange in the first quarter of this year to be 1.48 billion 
yuan ($170.1 million). 
  Meanwhile, the exchange has approved membership of four 
securities companies to its clearing system to make it more 
efficient. 
  They are the Hunan and Dalian securities trading centres and 
the Guangdong Maoming and Gansu securities registering companies. 
  So far, the clearing system has developed 103 member 
companies, 51 of which are Chinese. 
  Meanwhile, Shenzhen Securities Exchange has decided to 
suspend the listing of new firms to reverse the bearish trend in 
the stock market. 
  Many investors and analysts believe the problem is caused by 
the continued listing of new shares, which absorbs large amounts 
of capital, which causes share prices to slip. 
  In another development, five securities companies from the 
provinces of Hubei, Guangdong, Shaanxi, and Sichuan have 
recently gained membership of the Shenzhen Securities Exchange.

  [Text] Beijing, February 24 (CNS)--The levying of 
value-added tax on land is not something new in China as there 
have been precedents at home and even in Hong Kong, Taiwan and 
foreign countries, the former director of the State Land 
Administration Mr. Wang Xianjin said today. He noted that such 
tax was regarded as a necessity in the regulation of the real 
estate market because it could effectively curb land speculation 
and unreasonable profits, a move playing a guiding role in the 
placing of investment. 
  Promulgation of the provisional ordinance on value-added tax 
on land, according to Mr. Wang, received a strong reaction from 
the real estate sectors at home and in Hong Kong and Taiwan as 
well as overseas with many saying that the taxation rate was too 
high. Mr. Wang said that some of the opinions expressed were 
worth taking notice of by the authorities when working out 
details on the value-added tax on land. 
  Mr. Wang said he believed that a price rise and investment 
risk should be taken into account when calculating the added 
value, a common practice employed in Hong Kong, Taiwan and 
overseas. It is, however, yet to be decided what weight the 
risk factor should be given. 
  Preferential treatment should be given to some transactions 
involving the transfer of real estate, especially housing units 
approved by the government for their construction and sold at a 
price set by the government. Such housing should be exempted 
from the value-added tax. The tax should be cut by the half for 
sales of real estate resulting from planning by the government 
while sales of residential units should be subject to the 
value-added tax on land. Tax refunds are, however, possible for 
sellers of housing who buy another flat for their own use within 
a specific time. Real estate donated to the government or to 
charitable groups should be exempted from the value-added tax. 
Donated real estate should be turned over to the government in 
cases of disbandment of a particular charitable group which had 
received the donation. Transfer of land without any development 
following its sale should be subject to the value-added tax and 
such cases should also be dealt with in accordance with law. 
  Mr. Wang said that the regulation set earlier on real estate 
developers that they must undertake construction of welfare 
housing which must make up 20 percent of their total volume of 
their real estate development should be rescinded because such 
practice was not in line with the market mechanism.

  [Text] In the first clear evidence that Beijing has lost 
its battle on the capital-gains land tax, Shanghai has decided 
to delay imposing the tax until 1995 and permanently exempt 
primary developments. Mayor Huang Ju met little opposition when 
he informed Beijing of the decision last week, a senior Shanghai 
government official said yesterday on condition of anonymity. 
  Although the controversial tax was to be levied from January 
1 this year, Shanghai will delay implementation until 1995 at 
the earliest, the official said. Meanwhile, the city 
government, which is counting on receiving ample foreign 
property investment for green-field sites in the new Pudong area 
and for inner-city redevelopment, will exempt all primary 
land-development projects from the tax. "Even if the central 
government decides to include these projects, we will give them 
a permanent tax holiday," the official said. 
  The news will come as a blow to the State Taxation 
Administration in Beijing, which has asserted all along that the 
tax must be levied this year in line with the State Council's 
edict last month. Beijing's grip on the matter is expected to 
fall apart in the next few weeks as other cities and provinces 
announce their own delays and exemptions. 
  Hong Kong businessmen have voiced strong concern about the 
tax, saying it would scare away property investments. Some have 
made plans to lobby officials in Beijing and current projects 
are believed to be on hold.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Hotline to Help Fight Labour Abuses"] </F>
  [Text] A nationwide hotline for reporting labour law 
violations will open soon, the Ministry of Labour announced 
recently. 
  The move is in response to growing complaints from workers, 
ministry officials said. 
  The tipline will enable citizens to directly contact labour 
officials, making it easier to supervise factories, said Ren 
Zeming, a senior labour official. 
  Over the past few years, more and more workers have had 
their 
rights violated, particularly in foreign-funded firms. 
  Since 1988 there have been 250,000 strikes and labour 
disputes, the Tianjin-based JINWANBAO evening paper said. 
  They were usually caused by ambiguous contracts, long hours, 
low pay and unsafe working conditions. 
  Most occurred In coastal areas where millions of Chinese 
workers have taken jobs in foreign-funded companies. 
  Even in the capital, workers in a foreign-funded enterprise 
went on strike against low pay before Spring Festival. 
  In response to these problems, some labour departments have 
opened local hotlines for reporting abuses. 
  Late last year in Shenzhen a hotline tip led to the 
investigation of a local hardware factory where 27 workers had 
lost their fingers because of unsafe machinery. The case was 
quickly settled. 
  The nationwide hotline will begin "as soon as possible," Ren 
said. 
  Phone calls from the public will keep labour departments 
abreast of all news Ren noted. 
  He also said those who call can remain anonymous. And 
relevant departments will protect informers from retaliation.

  [Text] Harbin, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Six old industrial 
centers in China have restored their leading status in the 
national economy through three years' efforts in upgrading their 
production facilities. 
  The six cities are Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, 
Chongqing and Harbin. 
  According to the latest statistics from a symposium in 
Harbin, these cities have completed more than 15,800 projects 
since 1991, costing 57.71 billion yuan, of which some 8 billion 
yuan were state loans. 
  Going into operation, they will bring in 95.36 billion yuan 
in increased output value, 19.938 billion yuan in taxes and 
profits and 4.313 billion U.S. dollars in exports. 
  The industrial modernization process in these cities has 
seen 
good results in many aspects. 
  Thanks to it, the cities' pillar industries have achieved a 
rapid growth. At present, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang and Wuhan 
are technically strong in the auto sector, regaining the leading 
position in the country. And power facilities from Shanghai and 
Harbin have obtained over two-thirds of the domestic market 
share. 
  A batch of enterprises with high efficiency have become 
honey 
pots in these cities. During the 1991-1993 period, two-thirds 
of the cities' output value and taxes and profits increment had 
resulted from improved facilities. For example, taxes and 
profits in Chongqing Steel and Iron Company jumped from 1991's 
200 million yuan to 1993's 650 million yuan. 
  Also, the process has reinforced the competence of quite a 
few large and medium-sized enterprises. 
  In Tianjin, about 45 percent of some 60 big enterprises 
which 
used 5.2 billion yuan in technological upgrading have 
established a niche in the domestic and overseas market. 
  In Shanghai, many technological enhancement projects have 
been undertaken, involving the sectors such as communications, 
computers, bio-medicine and micro-electronics. 
  Experts hold that problems like capital shortage and rigid 
management still hinder the process. This year's newly-issued 
investment and tax policies may also bring about challenges as 
well as chances. 
  These six cities, most of whose medium and large enterprises 
were set up in the 1950s, had exerted an important impact on 
China's development at that time. 
  Since the 1980s, their industrial strength has been weakened 
owing to out-of-date facilities and products. 
  So the Chinese Government launched the campaign of 
industrial 
modernization in the cities in 1991.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China's imports and 
exports of nonferrous metals came to a record 3.6 billion U.S. 
dollars-worth in 1993, a national meeting has been told. 
  The meeting heard that imports accounted for 1.2 billion 
U.S. 
dollars of this amount. 
  Sources at the meeting said 458 million U.S. dollars-worth 
of 
exports and 890 million U.S. dollars-worth of exports were 
handled by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and 
Export Corporation. 
  That made the corporation's accumulated export since its 
founding ten years ago 5 billion U.S. dollars, the sources said. 
  Over the decade the corporation developed 45 subsidiaries in 
China, and 17 companies and representative offices abroad. Its 
annual business volume rose from 77 million U.S. dollars-worth 
in the beginning to 1.35 billion U.S. dollars-worth in 1993. 
  With mines and factories all over China as well as in the 
United States and Australia, and its powerful Hong Kong 
subsidiaries, the corporation is quickly growing into a large 
international group, the sources said.

  [Text] Beijing, February 23 (XINHUA) -- The output of 
China's aquatic products industry has been leading the world for 
four consecutive years, the "PEOPLE'S DAILY" reported today. 
  The country's annual quantity now takes up about one-sixth 
of 
the world's total. In comparison, China turned out only 
one-45th of the world's aquatic products in 1949, when the 
People's Republic of China was founded. 
  During the past 15 years in particular, a time of economic 
reforms and opening up to the outside world, the output of 
aquatic products rose by 2.8 times, reaching 17.86 million tons 
in 1993. 
  One distinct change is that the proportion of China's ocean 
fishing decreased while the freshwater fishing industry has 
grown markedly, the ratio now is three to two. 
  In addition, 48 percent of the country's output of aquatic 
products is from artificially bred stock, according to the paper. 
  However, on average, China's output is 14 kg of aquatic 
products per capita, only equal to two-thirds of the world's 
average, the newspaper noted.

  [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- China's advertising 
enterprises numbered 31,000 in 1993 with an annual turnover of 
13.4 billion yuan (about 2 billion U.S. dollars then), showing 
sharp increases of 90 percent and 98 percent respectively over 
1992 figures. 
  This was revealed today by Liu Baofu, head of the 
advertising 
department under the State Administration of Industry and 
Commerce (SAIC). 
  Specialized advertising companies in China totalled 11,000 
last year, earning 4.6 billion yuan, that is, a hike of 150 
percent over 1992, according to Liu. 
  To boost the advertising sector, the four publishing media 
of 
TV, radio, newspapers and magazines vigorously developed their 
own advertising enterprises in 1993, which gained an average 
business volume rise of 64.5 percent over the 1992 figure. 
  The advertising enterprises affiliated with cable TV, 
airlines, railways and theaters reaped a total of 1.54 billion 
yuan, sharing 11.5 percent of the total advertising business 
volume of the country, said Liu. 
  The SAIC official attributed the vigorous growth in the 
advertising sector to various reasons. 
  According to Liu, Chinese entrepreneurs have become more 
aware of the importance of advertising for their products amid 
fierce market competition and are willing to spend more on the 
sector. 
  Meanwhile, advertising companies are offering more 
satisfactory services in market investigation and research, 
advertising planning and media arrangement, in line with the 
so-called "modern advertising concept." 
  More significantly, the overall quality of advertising 
services has been heightened through the government's efforts in 
regulating the advertising market, in which all private, 
collectively-owned or state-run enterprises are encouraged to 
compete for market share. 
  Besides, more and more foreign enterprises are vying for the 
Chinese market and are investing more to advertise their 
products. 
  To ensure a sound and healthy development of the sector, the 
government has promulgated a series of rules and regulations to 
tighten control over advertising for food items, cosmetics and 
medicines in 1993, Liu added.

  [Text] Wuhan, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Construction of a 
ship lift at the Geheyan key water control project on the 
Qingjiang river, which empties into the Chang Jiang river 
eastward of the Three Gorges, started recently. 
  The building of the ship lift project, which requires a 
total 
investment of more than 200 million yuan, is aimed at 
establishing a reliable basis for the design and construction of 
another ship lift at the gigantic water control dam at the Three 
Gorges on the Chiang Jiang, said engineers responsible for the 
construction of the ship lift on Qingjiang river. 
  According to them, the main technical indexes of the ship 
lift under construction, designed and being constructed by the 
Wuhan Ship Building Company, observe a general proportion of one 
to ten with the ship lift to be built at the Three Gorges water 
control dam. 
  The ship lift now under construction is a major part of the 
Geheyan water control project. The ship lift, consisting of two 
separate vertical ship lifts, is expected to have a maximum 
lifting height of 122 m and a maximum lifting weight of 15,000 
tons when completed and put into use in 1997, said the engineers. 
  Construction of the ship lift at the Geheyan water control 
project of Qingjiang river is of great importance for promoting 
the economy of Hubei and opening up mountainous southwestern 
Hubei in the Qingjiang river watershed.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China's 
infrastructure, including energy, transport and 
telecommunications, a bedrock of China's investment environment, 
has clearly been improved during the past decade and more, 
though still lagging far behind China's economic development. 
  The situation has attracted overseas investors into the huge 
market in this field. 
  This is a view shared by representatives of nearly 20 
overseas business offices in Beijing, as shown in recent 
interviews with XINHUA when asked about China's investment 
environment. 
  According to Chun Song-Chin, chief representative of the 
Beijing office of the Lucky-Goldstar International Corporation 
from the Republic of Korea, the Chinese Government has long been 
aware of the importance of developing its infrastructure and has 
put large sums into it, as signally manifested by its 
determination to build the three gorges project and some other 
large water conservancy projects. 
  Klaus Kaltenthaler, chief Beijing representative of 
Germany's 
BASF Chemical Corporation, appreciated China's rapid development 
in telecommunications, saying that when the BASF came to China 
at the beginning of the '80s, China's telecommunication 
facilities were very backward, especially international 
telecommunication services. 
  But now, he said, China's telecommunications system was much 
better, with portable telephones and pagers widely in use. 
  H.T. Kung, director of the Public Relations Department of 
the AT&amp;T China Company, noted that China has invested 
heavily in 
the development of telecommunications satellites, cables and 
program- controlled telephones, which will increase the 
telephone users rate from 2.15 percent of the population last 
year to 3 percent this year, and the rate is expected to reach 6 
to 7 percent by the end of this century. 
  He added that this will in turn greatly promote China's 
economic development. 
  China's communication's development also left a strong 
impression on these overseas business people. 
  They felt that China's transport systems have been improved 
drastically, with great increases in the handling capacity of 
ports like Tianjin, Dalian and Shanghai, construction of more 
highways and electrification of railways, and opening of more 
domestic and international air routes. 
  They said, however, that China's infrastructure, still a 
weak 
point in China's investment environment, was lagging behind 
China's economic development, while from a long-term point of 
view, this field holds a huge market and vast potential for 
overseas investors who are also eager to be involved in this 
development. 
  With the speeding up of China's reform and opening up, Anne 
Stevenson-Yang, director of the Beijing office of the U.S.-China 
Business Council which has more than 250 U.S. member 
corporations, said that more and more U.S. companies want to 
take part in China's construction of airports, railways, 
highways and power stations, which has created a "craze" in the 
U.S. 
  On China's working efficiency and the quality of its 
personnel, these business executives believed that "the change 
in people's hearts and heads" and improvement of education are 
vitally important to China's reform and further improvement of 
China's investment environment. 
  On this point, China's finance sector attracts more of their 
interest. They said that they were pleased to see so many 
professional Chinese people engaged in that sector. 
  While thinking highly of the service of China's banks, they 
expressed their expectation of even better services in the 
future. 
  Dick Liu, president of the Du Pont China Company, said that 
Chinese Government officials are "more open, more cooperative 
and more efficient." 
  He took Du Pont as an example: the first contract signed in 
1991 between Du Pont and China took a year and a half to 
achieve, while the second one signed last year only took a year, 
and the third one which is under negotiation is expected to be 
signed in several months.

<F P=106> [Report by Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] A high-level reshuffle is expected in China's air 
industry in the wake of conflicts within the Chinese leadership 
over the allocation of six aircraft. 
  The president of China Southern, Yu Yanen, is likely to be 
stripped of power and replaced by a manager from another Chinese 
airline, according to mainland sources. 
  The conflict erupted in the State Council last month after a 
Vice-Premier, Zou Jiahua, backed Yu in resisting attempts by 
civil aviation officials to force China Southern to buy six 
Airbus A-340s, the sources said. Zou's 10-character letter of 
support for Yu, a copy of which was sent confidentially to Yu, 
read: "He [Yu] has a point. We need to reconsider it." 
  But Zou's attempt to intervene on behalf of his close 
associate was criticised by other senior leaders. "Mr Zou does 
not speak for the whole State Council," several unidentified 
state councillors said in an internal circular. 
  When China signed contracts for the aircraft, during a visit 
to Beijing last November by the Gerrnan Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
the main motivation was to show the United States "we can do 
without Boeing", the sources said. 
  Yu, whose China Southern flew only Boeings, argued that 
individual airlines should have autonomy in making aircraft 
purchase decisions. He accused the Civil Aviation 
Administration of China (CAAC) of withholding approval for 
long-haul flights to Europe and the U.S. unless China Southern 
accepted the A-340s. 
  But CAAC officials cited a 1984 document which said airlines 
could make decisions on "aircraft-related equipment" but did not 
have the power to determine which aircraft are purchased. The 
State Council decided to support the CAAC's enforcement of the 
document, allowing the agency to determine which airline would 
be saddled with the aircraft. 
  But Yu had remained defiant. "What are you dragging out this 
old document for?" he reportedly demanded in a meeting with CAAC 
in late January. "It was written before our airline even 
existed." 
  China Southern was created as a regional carrier in 1988, 
three years after China began breaking up its civil aviation 
monopoly. "If you really want us to take the planes, then you 
pay for them!" he is reported to have told officials. 
  Yu's outspokenness on the issue, which included drawing on 
his close relationships with the Premier, Li Peng, and the 
Guangdong Government, as well as Zou Jiahua, has landed him in 
the CAAC's bad books. "This was the worst example of Yu's 
belligerent behaviour towards the administration," a source said. 
  Yu will be stripped of his president's office and moved into 
the newly-created symbolic position of chairman of China 
Southern. The changes were being handled by CAAC's deputy 
director, Shen Yuankang, who has been given the task of whipping 
independently minded regional airlines into line. 
  This move, as well as other senior management changes within 
China's main airlines, will be announced when the CAAC holds its 
first national work meeting under its new director, Chen 
Guangyi, at the end of this month or in early March. 
  Airbus officials said they are confused by the affair. "I 
don't know their reasoning for signing a contract with no 
airline in mind. Only the Chinese can answer that," a spokesman, 
David Vellupilai, said. However, he said a decision needed to 
be made this year so that peripheral equipment selections could 
be made in preparation for the scheduled first delivery in 1995. 
  China Southern hoped to order Boeing 777-Bs, equivalent to 
the A-340, to begin its long haul flights. The airline 
management has been told its technical staff would have to be 
doubled to service the complex and unfamiliar Airbus planes.

<F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "85 Percent Rise in Technical Service </F>
Companies"] 
  [Text] Scientific research and technological services are 
in demand. Last year, the number of firms engaged in such 
activity jumped by 85 per cent. 
  By the end of last year, 98,000 firms were involved in 
scientific services, statistics from the State Administration 
for Industry and Commerce indicated. Public health, sports, and 
welfare services also grew, as the number of firms in these 
areas grew 54 per cent over 1992. 
  Tertiary firms and companies in the fields of geological 
prospecting, education, art and culture, real estate, 
residential community services, and consulting also increased. 
  "This shows that the tertiary industry is developing 
smoothly" said officials with the State administration, which is 
in charge of issuing business licences. 
  However, transportation, postal and telecommunications, 
finance, and insurance services have failed to grow at a similar 
rate, the statistics indicated. 
  "The tertiary industry has great potential for development," 
the officials said, predicting that the country's service sector 
will develop rapidly in the coming years. 
  By the end of last year, 7.28 million enterprises employing 
252 million workers were registered at the State administration 
and its local branches. 
  In 1993, they had a record 4,236 billion yuan ($486.9 
billion) in registered capital, surpassing the 2,780 billion 
yuan ($319.5 billion) set in the previous year. 
  Never before in China's history have the number of 
enterprises grown so rapidly. 
  Among the country's enterprises, 5.02 million are engaged in 
tertiary industry, about 70 per cent of the total. 
  The average amount of capital registered by service sector 
corporations was about 1 million yuan ($114,942), a 9 percent 
rise over 1992. 
  Hainan Province, Beijing, and Shanghai were hot spots for 
such firms. They listed 2.38 million yuan ($0.27 million), 1.22 
million yuan, and 1.17 million yuan in registered capital 
respectively. 
  While more than 1.83 million new enterprises and firms 
opened 
for business last year, some 340,000 companies folded--33 per 
cent more than in 1992--indicating increasing competition 
nationwide.

Seminar on China's Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Reveals 
That China Will Adopt New Strategy of Exchanging Markets for 
Technology"] 
  [Text] At a seminar on China's foreign economic relations 
and trade in the 1990's held a few days ago, senior officials 
from China's foreign economic and trade departments revealed an 
"overall strategic concept" for foreign economic relations and 
trade in the 1990's. In the sphere of utilizing foreign 
capital, it covers the practice of exchanging markets for 
technology, a change from providing preferential treatment to 
certain regions to guiding them with industrial policies, 
amendments made to relevant policies according to GATT 
requirements, the provision of "citizen treatment" for 
foreign-invested enterprises, and so on. 
  The concept also proposed that 10 extra-large foreign trade 
enterprises should be capable of competing with large 
multinational corporations and should be set up in China within 
five to eight years. 
  As pointed out in the "strategic concept," China's foreign 
trade increased by 16 percent each year between 1978 and 1992, 
which was seven percentage points higher than the national 
economic growth rate. 
  Foreign trade in the 1990's should continue growing at a 
rate 
three to five percentage points higher than that of economic 
development. 
  Taken as a whole, this "overall strategy on economy and 
trade" formulated by senior economic and trade specialists 
includes the following aspects: 
  -- The formation of a domestic and international open 
pattern 
of multiple directions, channels, and areas; the development of 
a diversified markets with stress on the Asia-Pacific region; 
and the accelerated unification of the domestic and 
international economies. 
  -- An extensive merger of foreign economic and trade 
undertakings, including the merger of foreign trade, foreign 
capital, foreign investment, and other foreign economic and 
trade businesses; "integrated" and coordinated development of 
commodities, technology, services, and trade; the close 
integration of multilateral, regional, and bilateral economic 
and trade cooperation; the close integration of trade, industry, 
agriculture, technology, banking, and commerce; and the 
integration of macroeconomic regulation and control at home and 
abroad, thus forming a concerted force for China to participate 
in international competition. 
  -- Great changes in function, such as the expansion of the 
scope of foreign economic and trade, increasing contributions 
made to the economy as a whole, the promotion of industrial 
structural readjustment, and exercising a comprehensive, guiding 
role in economic and technological advances and industrial 
development. 
  In the utilization of foreign capital, it is necessary to 
increase scale, pay more attention to quality, and enhance the 
level of utilizing foreign capital in the regions of central and 
western China; carry out the practice of exchanging markets for 
technology; change from providing preferential treatment to 
certain regions to guiding them by industrial policies; expand 
the investment scope of multinational corporations; participate 
in the international division of labor with regard to technology 
and knowledge-intensive industries; grant treatment as citizens 
to foreign-invested enterprises; and extend the utilization of 
foreign capital to banking, insurance, transportation, commerce, 
and so on. 
  In importing technology, it is necessary to strive to 
increase the proportion of advanced technological equipment from 
30.8 percent in 1990 to 40 percent by the end of this century, 
and greater emphasis should be laid on importing strategic 
industries. 
  In overseas investment, the proportion of investment abroad 
and the importation of foreign capital should be around 1:0.15, 
and work should be focused on giving export guidance, developing 
natural resources, and importing technical know how. 
  The concept put forth the necessity of establishing a number 
of large, comprehensive and internationalized foreign trade 
enterprises operating as enterprise groups, Chinese-style 
business firms with the nature of industrialized and 
internationalized foreign trade enterprise groups, and 10 
extra-large economic and trade enterprises capable of competing 
with big multinational corporations within five to eight years.

<F P=106> [Report on interviews by staff reporters He Jiazheng (0149 </F>
0502 2973) and Zhou Hongyang (0719 3126 3152): "How To Carry 
Out Comprehensive Agricultural Development?--Interview With Li 
Yanling, Vice Finance Minister and Director of the State Office 
for Comprehensive Agricultural Development"] 
  [Text] Comprehensive agricultural development, a huge 
project with an influence on the whole country, has already been 
implemented for five full years. The project has entailed a 
total investment of 20 billion yuan, has transformed 100 million 
mu of medium and low-yield fields, and has added 17.16 billion 
kg of grain over the past five years.... 
  Nevertheless, many people do not have a good idea of what 
the 
project is, what goals it supposed to achieve, and how it is 
being carried out. Some confuse it with ordinary agricultural 
development, as we usually call it. For this reason, we called 
on Li Yanling, vice finance minister and director of the State 
Office for Comprehensive Agricultural Development. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] What is the distinction between 
"comprehensive development" of agriculture and ordinary 
development, as we usually call it? 
  [Li Yanling] Comprehensive agricultural development is 
distinguished by its "comprehensiveness." Comprehensive 
agricultural development has a special meaning. It is a real 
engineering project with fixed sources of funds, clear 
principles of development, strict management methods, and 
special organizations for its organization. Its use of 
resources is comprehensive. It emphasizes the transformation of 
medium and low-yield fields while increasing the area of 
farmland at the same time. Its main contents are to increase 
production of grain, cotton, edible oils, meat, and sugar, and 
to carry out the comprehensive management and development of 
hills, water, level fields, afforestation, and road construction 
with high starting points and high standards. It carries out 
project management in development areas with reference to 
industrial management methods. The State Office for 
Comprehensive Agricultural Development coordinates planning, 
finance, and banking, as well as agriculture, forestry, and 
water works. It is specifically in charge of selecting and 
deciding on projects in various development areas and is in 
charge of project development, examination, and acceptance as 
well as the achievement of targets. Development funds are 
shared by the center, the local authorities, and the banks. The 
center's financial expenditures on this now comes to 2 billion 
yuan or so each year, while the province, prefecture, and county 
contribute one-third each and banks extend loans in keeping with 
the proportion of the center's financial appropriations. These 
funds, plus the deposits of vast numbers of peasants, form a 
huge development force. Over the past five years, we have 
invested a total of 20 billion yuan in various project areas and 
have obtained very obvious comprehensive efficiency. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] Such a large investment, with 20 billion yuan 
spent over five years on land development, is rare. Could you 
tell us what the main direction for development is? 
  [Li] This large-scale, comprehensive agricultural 
development set up as a project by the state is an important 
measure by the state to increase agricultural investment and 
enhance the comprehensive productive capability of agriculture. 
Since the measure has integrated an appropriate scale of 
operation with the contract responsibility system on a household 
basis with remuneration linked to output, integrated the state's 
macroscopic regulation and control with the full utilization of 
incentives for peasants, and integrated an improvement of basic 
conditions for agricultural production with increasing peasants' 
incomes; this has produced remarkable achievements. Development 
areas have taken on a rural look where one can find tracts of 
fields, rows of trees, and networks of canals and roads are 
linked and bridges and dams are linked and matched. Conditions 
for production have improved, peasants' incomes have increased 
accordingly, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, 
sideline occupations, and fisheries are developing in an 
all-round way. Practice over the years shows that the 
investment direction is clear and the input-output ratio is very 
high, and that financially speaking, capital returns on 
comprehensive agricultural development are good as well. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] Where do you think the success of the "method 
of project management" adopted for comprehensive development 
lies as far as the procurement, use, and management of funds is 
concerned? 
  [Li] Carrying out comprehensive agricultural development in 
line with project management is a World Bank-aided project 
carried out with reference to industrial management methods. It 
is also managed by employing these methods. The most 
distinctive characteristic of project management is that we 
invest funds right into these projects, rather than "scattering" 
them everywhere without a definite goal. With state investment 
taking the lead, all localities now have the incentive and can 
choose projects in their own areas according to the requirements 
of the projects. After deciding on these projects, and when the 
funds from the center arrive, they can attract the same amount 
of funds as supporting funds. Most of this portion of the funds 
is used to improve the conditions for agricultural production, 
while a small proportion is used to develop diverse economic 
sectors, thus stabilizing grain and cotton production and 
increasing incomes simultaneously. As for bank loans, a small 
proportion of them is used to improve production conditions and 
the main proportion is used to develop high-yield, high-quality, 
and high-efficiency agriculture and diverse economic sectors so 
as to ensure that peasants' incomes will increase after 
development. 
  There is a regulatory mechanism which provides a very high 
incentive to all localities and ensures projects are done well. 
If your project proceeds well and is passed in keeping with 
requirements, then the center and the banks will continue to 
pump in funds. If it does not proceed well, then they will 
withdraw the funds. The better a project proceeds, the more 
funds will be pumped into it. These investments are directly 
made in the land of the localities and conform to local 
interests. The state has also achieved government control 
[zheng fu xing wei 2398 1650 5887 3634] over land development by 
means of macroscopic regulation and control. 
  As for the use and management of funds, since development 
areas have various levels of responsibility systems or 
contractual restrictions for comprehensive agricultural 
development at all levels, the effective use of development 
funds is guaranteed. Zhejiang has done very well in the 
procurement of agricultural development funds. They have 
reached the financial ratio of 1.47:1, exceeding the ratio of 
1:1 demanded by the center. In keeping with the principle that 
"whoever borrows the money repays it, whoever lends the money 
gets it back, and whoever profits assumes responsibility," 
repayment measures for the repayable funds are practical. 
Despite the fact that the amount of funds invested by the 
center is not very large at the present time, since 50 percent 
is used with compensation, it can form a revolving investment 
mechanism when this is retrieved. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] At present, some of the funds for 
comprehensive agricultural development must be repaid. Could 
you tell me what specific contents this has? 
  [Li] This is also a question I wanted to talk about. In the 
course of establishing a socialist market economic structure, it 
is necessary to renew concepts, improve our understanding, and 
change the traditional idea that "the state finances while the 
peasants farm." The partially compensated use of the 
comprehensive agricultural development funds was confirmed right 
from the very beginning. The specific arrangements are: 50 
percent of investment is made by the center in projects without 
compensation, while the other 50 percent must be repaid in due 
time. The funds retrieved can be reinvested for revolving 
investment purposes. The compensated use of agricultural 
development funds is a great reform in agricultural-support 
funds. On the one hand, it can enhance the sense of 
responsibility of the funds user and improve the efficiency of 
funds use. On the other hand, it is possible to gradually 
alleviate the long-standing shortage of agricultural funds 
through revolving use. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] In interviews, we mostly heard calls to 
initiate projects and ask for funds, and this shows the great 
appeal of comprehensive development to all localities. We would 
like you to talk about how the funds are invested in this area. 
  [Li] Comprehensive development funds are divided into three 
parts, which I have mentioned previously. The main source of 
funds or the original main channel was agricultural development 
funds, which included proceeds taken out of budget regulating 
funds, farmland use tax, tax levied on special agricultural and 
forestry products, and others. Since the introduction of some 
reform measures, some of the original funds channels have 
disappeared and others channels have no funds coming in. 
Following the continuous development of comprehensive 
agricultural development, investment will surely be increased in 
the future. At present, the center directly makes provisions 
for these funds in its budget each year. Moreover, it is going 
to increase this year by year. The net land value-added tax 
portion of the property value-added tax recently levied by the 
state should be included in the investment plan for 
comprehensive agricultural development by all possible means. 
Moreover, the portion of tax levied excessively on special 
agricultural and forestry products in previous years should 
mostly be used for comprehensive agricultural development. Bank 
loans should be increased year by year on the present basis. 
The strategic consideration is that funds for comprehensive 
agricultural development should gradually tilt toward the 
central and western regions. On the whole, funds used for 
comprehensive agricultural development can only be increased, 
but not the other way round.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ban Mingli (2432 2494 7787): "A </F>
Laborer's Letter to RENMIN RIBAO Voices His Thinking on Labor 
Flow"] 
  [Text] Many people are talking about the "wave of peasant 
laborers" these days but how many people have listened to the 
words from their hearts or have a real understanding of them? I 
dare not say I do. I am only one of these people. 
  On 26 January 1993, I wrote a report entitled "`Ten Thousand 
People Want' To Become `Another Thousand People's Friends,'" 
introducing Tianjin's labor service market. In it, one short 
paragraph mentioned how the market guided the "wave of peasant 
laborers" and it also carried a short commentary affirming that 
the labor service market's exploration about that was very 
meaningful and that this should be continued. Honestly, 
although the short commentary discussed the question of how to 
guide and manage peasant laborers, I cannot but admit that I had 
misgivings about whether I could shoulder this heavy task for 
the labor force market. 
  The labor force market now has limited conditions but the 
"wave of peasant laborers" is great. Although it may be 
possible to find jobs for some peasant laborers, the number is 
insignificant. Moreover, peasant laborers can move about freely. 
Are they willing to accept orderly management? 
  My misgivings have been dispelled since I received a letter 
on 5 February from "a man who has a job," voicing his thoughts. 
  The man is called Zhang Dejin, a worker in the service 
detachment of Shilou Fire Service in Fangshan district, Beijing. 
Although we never met, I can say for sure from his letter that 
he is a peasant worker, a villager from the hills. After 
reading the report of how Tianjin's labor force market guided 
the "wave of peasant workers," he wrote me a letter with great 
excitement, saying that "he had had this idea for six or seven 
years and had finally found the person to talk to about it." I 
am honored that as an author, I have the trust of a reader but I 
feel that the weight of the letter lies in the words which 
profoundly analyze the "indiscriminate flow of laborers" and 
which call for the founding of a peasant labor market with full 
expectations. 
  Let me reveal the original contents of the letter to all of 
you. 
  "After working for one year outside, I had this idea: 
Why does society call peasant laborers "indiscriminately 
flowing laborers." It means that first, they are flowing 
indiscriminately; second, there is a gap between city and rural 
people; third, peasant laborers create many unhealthy trends in 
society, exert a very bad influence on social stability, and so 
forth." 
  The "wave of peasant laborers" makes a "wave" because 
of the large number of laborers who need transport each year and 
cause a big headache. Service personnel in buses and on trains 
are disgusted with them. Their bulky personal baggage causes 
inconvenience to work personnel. What they do causes harm to 
those who are touring, visiting friends and families, and on 
business trips.... How do city dwellers look on peasant 
laborers. Most of the laborers do filthy manual work and they 
do not change their working clothes. In a bus, if a peasant 
laborer stands by the side of a seated passenger, he will 
immediately stand up and give him the seat. What effect do 
their words and deeds have on city children.... City dwellers 
look down on them. They have reason to discriminate against 
them. When a person comes to a strange place without a cent, 
with very little education, and holding extreme views, what can 
he do in order to survive. What will he get up to? So long as 
someone gives him money and food he will do whatever he wants 
including committing crime. The starting point for prostitution 
in society is like this: A country girl whose head is full of 
feudalist ideas has been deceived. In order to fight back and 
survive, she can only live like this. What excuse do they use 
to abduct and traffic in women. Most of them use the pretense 
of employing workers, child workers from society. The article 
"Where Have the Hill Girls Gone" on page 10 of the 25 January 
edition of RENMIN RIBAO, was just part of the story. I am 
illiterate because I began to work very early and this has been 
very harmful to my own body." 
  Here I have quoted large paragraphs of Zhang Dejin's 
original 
words. I did not even change his grammar and the mistake of not 
using question marks at the end of questions. Although the 
letter may have flaws, it does not cause the peasant laborer, 
who is in the wave, produce an inferior analysis of himself. If 
we say that city dwellers mostly see the surface of the 
"indiscriminate flow," then peasant laborers themselves dare to 
analyze the question from the angles of society and themselves. 
  The beginning of the decadent phenomena. Peasant 
laborers consider bribing and giving presents as paying a debt 
of gratitude. Many have come to work in cities. I know that 
some of them, the quick minds as they are called in society, are 
up to some bad things. Now that peasant laborers need to be 
managed, they seize this opportunity to invite guests, give 
presents, and become laborers' foremen. Will these foremen 
still participate in labor? Many shoddy and fake products come 
from the hands of peasant laborers. For example, taking 
advantage of peasant laborers, many small private enterprises do 
not register for a place of temporary residence and do not 
obtain temporary residence certificates. They do not register 
with the authorities and yet begin production in out-of-the-way 
places on the outskirts and they sell their products by improper 
means. Moreover, these units also evade taxes and their 
products seriously affect the market. How do the small 
businessmen from the flowing population lead a life, and so 
forth? Can all these phenomena be resolved equitably? Yes, 
they can but who will trouble to do this?" 
"In areas where peasant laborers abound, there are no 
village-run enterprises and nearly no township-run enterprises. 
So what are the village and township work personnel doing? 
They have time, energy, and ability to rationally send peasant 
laborers to employing units. For what do peasant laborers hope? 
Before I left home, I had thought that it would be a little 
easier to make money in a place nearer home. There were already 
three parties that had asked for money, and there would not be a 
fourth party. A person who has a wife and children hopes that 
his family will be taken care of properly. It is more 
appropriate for him to be near home. There was an article on 
page five of the 29 January edition of RENMIN RIBAO entitled: 
"The Core of Rural Work Cannot be Independent of Developing 
Agriculture." Parents hope that their children will go to a 
definite place so they do not have to worry about them. Female 
housekeepers and female workers in individually-run restaurants 
are particularly afraid. Families hiring the housekeepers fear 
that they will not behave themselves. Bosses of individual 
entrepreneurs are the same. Employing units and individuals 
have the backing of the government's labor department. Peasant 
laborers have the backing of a basic-level village or township 
government and both sides have the sense of security. If 
villages or townships act as employment agencies, they can 
increase incomes and lessen peasant burdens at the same time. 
If so, foremen who only invite guests and give presents and who 
do not do labor must also participate in labor, thus promoting 
the current "anticorruption" work. It is the same now as when I 
worked as a worker that foremen do not work a single day and 
that, at the end of each month, they give presents, settle 
accounts, retain their portion, and give out the remainder as 
wages." 
  Zhang Dejin's hope for the use of rural labor force is that 
it "be like conscription in which a certain unit registers at a 
designated place." He said: "The following are some of 
my suggestions for the rational arrangement for peasant 
laborers. My suggestion is that every city should have a labor 
service market. How many markets are like that of Tianjin. What 
figure makes the "wave of peasant laborers" a "wave." In order 
to cope with this, we can only begin work with the government 
first. Take back the portion previously taken by foremen and 
peasant laborers contribute their part. For example, 
registration fees and labor insurance can be used to develop the 
labor force market. If so, it would develop much faster than it 
does. For example, our Pingyuan County has a vast flowing 
population. Through the county's labor affairs bureau, peasant 
laborers had to pay several dozen yuan without going out in 
order to vie for vacancies in the Huabei Oil Field and Beijing's 
police and public security units. What vacancies there were, I 
did not have a good idea. Anyway, peasant laborers thought this 
was reasonable. The government labor affairs bureau can collect 
an introductory charge from employing units and individuals. 
They are very willing to pay the money. Establishing and 
improving the labor force market, step by step, by pooling funds 
from laborers is much quicker than the natural establishment. 
The greatest beneficiaries are the whole society, whole 
country, and laborers themselves." 
  This ordinary, letter which is full of genuine feelings, is 
enough to enable city dwellers to understand more about the 
so-called "indiscriminate flow." The opinion on the 
significance, ways, and means of establishing a labor service 
market for peasant laborers in the letter does enough to win the 
respect of city dwellers. 
  Having an idea of something is the foundation of 
understanding it and understanding precedes the "resolution" of 
a problem. Cities have a great responsibility to resolve the 
"wave of peasant laborers" and they are an important market for 
absorbing the rural work force. Only by first understanding 
peasant laborers can we enthusiastically think of the ways to 
take action to help them find a way out. Not only labor affairs 
departments should do this but also the government and all 
quarters of society should care for them. Peasant laborers are 
the main body of the labor force market. The fact that they have 
such earnest aspirations and ideas to establish a labor force 
market offers a good foundation for the establishment of this 
market. 
  If we can find more jobs or make good arrangements for 
peasant laborers, their livelihood can be guaranteed and 
stability will prevail in society. Moreover, it is possible 
that many a good and talented people, such as entrepreneurs and 
scientists, will emerge from these peasant laborers one day! 
  The opportunity is now. Zhang Dejin's letter also tells us 
one thing: "As a national traditional festival, the Spring 
Festival is a very good opportunity. Peasant workers are now 
spending the holiday back home and village and township 
governments have the best time to control their flow." Places 
charged with the task of exporting labor services must not miss 
this opportunity from now on. With the great importance attached 
to it by governments at all levels, with organization by labor 
departments, and with the support of peasant laborers and 
employing units, the rural labor force market will surely and 
undoubtedly grow and expand.

  [Text] Hefei, February 24 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui 
Province has fostered the development of multi-level labor 
markets to exercise control over the formerly disorganized 
outflow of rural labor forces to cities and towns. 
  Improvement of rural productivity has resulted in a labor 
surplus in many rural areas. These surplus laborers push into 
new areas, especially into cities which seem to promise more 
work opportunities and better lives. 
  Individual introduction used to be the most common way for 
farmers to find employment. But the spreading of false 
information or even downright swindling commonly left farmers 
with losses of money and time. 
  To eliminate the blind seeking of employment and better 
organize the surplus labor force, labor markets have been 
established in 16 cities and 68 counties of the province and 
more than 400 career-introduction institutions have mushroomed 
in rural towns and villages. 
  Offering a series of services including registration, 
arrangement of interview, supervision of signing and 
implementation of employment and labor insurance contracts, 
those labor markets have successfully satisfied the demands for 
laborers in enterprises and accorded employment to many rural 
laborers. 
  Zhang Gongyou, a farmer from Wuwei county, was employed as a 
salesman for a Beijing-based commercial enterprise only ten days 
after his registration in the county's labor market. He said 
happily that the labor market had saved his money and time and 
he could hardly believe that seeking a job could be so quick and 
easy. 
  According to officials of the provincial labor bureau, up to 
now 600,000 rural laborers, or one-fourth of the total who had 
crowded into cities seeking opportunities and temporary jobs, 
have been channeled through labor markets. 
  The Huainan and Huaibei coal mines, which once experienced 
much difficulty in hiring enough miners, have managed to employ 
20,000 rural contracted laborers thanks to the introduction of 
labor markets. 
  The Anhui Labor Bureau has also for the first time sent 
nearly 1,000 laborers to Japan and the Philippines. 
  The province plans to further strengthen the implementation 
of relevant laws and improve quality and effectiveness in 
offering labor services to its five million surplus rural 
laborers this year, said the labor bureau official.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yonghong: "State Loans To Help </F>
Spark Rural Power Plan"] 
  [Text] The government plans to increase investment in its 
ambitious rural electrification programme. 
  The ongoing second phase of the scheme, which will supply 
electricity to 90 per cent of households in 200 counties 
nationwide, will get a big help from loans. 
  In 1991 the State began annually allocating 200 million yuan 
($23 million) from its fiscal budget to the project. 
  This year the loans will be increased, said Vice-Minister 
Chen Yaobang of the State Planning Commission. 
  Chen made the statement at the opening meeting yesterday of 
the national conference on rural electrification. 
  The loans from the China Agricultural Bank and other 
domestic 
banks will increase from last year's 1 billion yuan ($115 
million) to 1.7 billion yuan ($181 million), said Zhang 
Chunyuan, Vice-Minister of Water Resources. 
  China launched the project in 1991, aiming to develop 
hydroelectric power. 
  Most of the counties covered by the programme are in the 
South. 
  The State has targeted 200 counties in 24 provinces and 
autonomous regions -- most on the government's list of 
underdeveloped areas. 
  It is part of the national bid to lay a solid foundation for 
rural social and economic development. 
  In the past three years, machinery capable of generating 
3.77 
million kilowatts of electricity has been installed. They can 
now generate 594 million kilowatt-hours in electricity. 
  More than 18 million farmers from 5 million families in 
programme-covered counties now have electricity as a result. 
  At the conference, which ends tomorrow, 14 counties were 
awarded for meeting the programme's electricity target. 
  Under the scheme, the annual electricity consumption of 
households in the counties is expected to be more than 200 kwh 
-- the national average for rural areas. 
  And industry and agriculture in these areas will be assured 
of electricity for at least 330 days a year. 
  Zhang said machinery capable of generating 15 million 
kilowatts in electricity needs to be completed by 1995 to meet 
the project's goals. 
  At the meeting Zhang said the programme will be extended to 
another 300 counties for the Ninth Five-year Plan period 
(1996-2000).

<F P=106> [By Wang Ma: "Northern Crops Are Devastated by Drought"] </F>
  [Text] A chronic drought has destroyed many winter crops 
in North and Northwest China and is threatening to wipe out 
spring harvests of grain and cotton. 
  A Shaanxi drought control official said that combating the 
protracted water shortage is at the top of his province's agenda. 
  Many crops have grown poorly and some seedlings have even 
died because of the drought, the official told China Daily. 
  The city of Xianyang lost 2,700 hectares of winter wheat 
when 
seedlings died, he said. 
  Meanwhile, many rivers and dams in the province are rapidly 
losing water. 
  "The drought has seriously affected the preparation for 
spring farming, especially of cotton," he said. 
  An additional 1.2 million hectares of winter wheat--or 
two-thirds of all farmland for summer harvest--are threatened by 
the drought. 
  The problem has persisted since the start of winter, leaving 
more than 6.7 million hectares of farmland across the north and 
northwest which have not been irrigated difficult to sow, 
People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] reported yesterday. 
  And the lack of moisture in some winter wheat areas also 
makes spring ploughing more difficult, the paper said. 
  The drought-control official said irrigation departments 
have 
pumped water to 646,600 hectares of farm land. 
  Yuncheng Prefecture, another hard hit area in North China's 
Shanxi Province has used every irrigation facility and power 
capacity to get water to its farms. 
  But as provincial governments in the north are scrambling to 
find adequate water supplies, the rest of China is ready for a 
bumper crop. 
  The government's price hikes on rice and cotton last year 
left farmers in higher spirits with more money for labour and 
investment. 
  In Hubei and Hunan, two major grain and cotton producing 
provinces in Central China, fertilizers and grain and cotton 
seeds are in great demand. 
  Statistics from Hunan Province said its farmers had bought a 
record 337,100 tons of fertilizer in December, 120 per cent more 
than the year before.

  [Text] Changsha, February 24 (XINHUA) -- An international 
prize-winning high-yield hybrid rice seed production technology 
has been made into TV programs, both in English and Chinese, in 
central China's Hunan Province. 
  The technology, which was invented by the young agronomist 
Huang Peijin after five years' painstaking efforts, is believed 
to be able to solve the long-existing problem of low yields per 
ha [hectare] when producing hybrid rice seeds. 
  The application of the technology in Lingling Prefecture has 
recorded a per ha average output of 4,500 kg on a large area of 
farmland over the past three years, and helped save more than 
3,000 hectares of improved farmland from making rice seed, 
bringing about 40 million yuan in output value. 
  Domestic and overseas experts say that the technology is of 
high value in application. 
  The invention of the technology, which has also obtained a 
national patent, has brought Huang many honors, including the 
gold prize given by the International Intellectual Property 
Organization. 
  Professor Yuan Longping, dubbed "father of hybrid rice" and 
a 
chief technical advisor for the technology, wrote inscriptions 
for the TV programs made by the seed company in Lingling 
Prefecture of Hunan. 
  Teaching materials, both in English and Chinese, have also 
been published by China Scientific and Technological Publishing 
House in tandem with the TV programs, according to local 
officials.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon [23 February], provincial 
leaders Jia Qinglin [provincial party committee secretary and 
governor], Lin Kaiqin, and Shi Xingmou came to the conference 
hall on the sixth floor of the provincial expressway 
headquarters and praised expressway builders present there. 
  Comrade Jia Qinglin said: Last year, expressway builders 
worked day and night for Fujian's expressway projects. The 
provincial party committee, provincial government, and people 
throughout the province are thankful to them. We must build 
highways if we want to live a happy life. Since the deepening 
of reform, more and more people have understood the importance 
of building expressways and have acknowledged your achievements. 
Owing to speedy economic development in the province, however, 
Fujian's transportation facilities have become incompatible with 
economic construction. Therefore the people throughout the 
province urgently feel the need to have expressways built. In 
this situation, you have a heavier burden to undertake and a 
more glorious task to fulfill. We should seize the opportunity 
and do a good job in expressway construction. [words indistinct]

  [Text] Fuzhou, February 23 (CNS) -- Fujian has in recent 
years seen rapid development of its civil aviation industry with 
the province now having three airports for civilian purposes, 
two airlines and 80 domestic and international air routes, 
forming an air transport network linking up with various places 
in the country as well as with the international community. 
  The province has raised capital through many channels 
including governmental financial allocation and joint investment 
of various kinds to promote the development of the civil 
aviation industry there with the newly-built Gaoqi International 
Airport in Xiamen and the Fuzhou Airport being transformed and 
expanded at a cost of several hundred million renminbi now 
making it capable of simultaneously housing eight Boeing 757 
airliners and handling a passenger flow of 1.165 million and 18 
million tonnes of freight annually. The growth for this industry 
is expected to be 30 percent every year. 
  At present, the province owns four civil airliners and 
operates 390 regular flights each week, linking up 70 cities at 
home and abroad. The annual volume of air passengers handled in 
the province exceed 3.7 million and cargo of 30 million tonnes, 
ranking the province tenth in the country in this sector up from 
one of the more backward ones in the past. 
  In addition, the province has plans to build several other 
airports including international airport in Changle, the Shaxian 
Airport in Sanming City and the Qingyang Airport in Jinjiang 
City.

  [Text] Fuzhou, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Job-finding has 
become an increasingly active service in East China's Fujian 
Province, with the market economy developing rapidly in China. 
  Recently, Jinan labor market in the capital city of Fuzhou, 
the largest labour market in Fujian, celebrated its success in 
finding the 10,000th job since 1992. 
  Sample statistics show that there are now more than 300 
job-finding agencies in the province, which have found jobs for 
more than a million people. 
  In contrast, job-finding agencies were unknown in China 
before it initiated its market economic reform in the early 
1980s. People were then allocated jobs instead of finding them 
and had little freedom of choice. 
  The year 1988 saw the establishment of the Fujian Company of 
Talent Development and Service of the provincial personnel 
bureau, the first job-finding agency in the province. Over the 
past five years, it has found jobs for thousands of job seekers, 
including returned students from overseas. 
  The majority of the job-finding agencies are sponsored by 
labor departments. By June 1993 some 255 such agencies had been 
so sponsored. The markets play an important role in the 
distribution of labor resources. 
  The job seekers in the markets have to show their I.D. cards 
and other relevant certificates and the markets have a list of 
employers and job-seekers, to match them up. The agency is paid 
both by the employer and the job-seeker. 
  In the second half of last year, the provincial government 
decided to give greater support to non-governmental bodies and 
individuals in opening job-finding agencies. 
  The decision gave a boost to the prosperous service. 
  in quanzhou, a coastal city where the non-state-run economy 
dominates, 93 job-finding agencies had been set up by the end of 
last year. 
  At present, nearly a million laborers needed by the 
foreign-funded, township and private-run enterprises in the city 
come mainly from the labor markets.

  [Text] Nanjing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The Hongze River in 
northern Jiangsu Province, which used to be notorious for 
disastrous floods, has been tamed and now irrigates fields, 
offers convenient transportation and is a rich source of fish. 
  The bed of the Hongze River is higher than the surrounding 
areas as a result of silt caused by the overflowing of the 
Yellow River in the past. 
  A 67.25-km-long dam has been built to prevent leakage of 
water. The dam is five to nine meters higher than the ground 
level. 
  According to Lu Senlin, director of the Hongze River 
Harnessing Committee, the government has organized the local 
people to dig and renovate irrigation ditches, dredge the mouth 
of the Huaihe River, and build three major floodgates to allow 
floodwaters to drain off at a rate of 11,800 cu m [cubic meters] 
per second since the 1950s. 
  While diverting water to irrigate farmland, local people 
have 
made full use of the water resources. 
  A survey shows that the output of aquatic products amounted 
to 71,000 tons last year, an increase of 4.7 times over 1985.

  [Text] At the 25 January provincial united front work 
conference, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, emphasized: The party's united front is an important 
magic weapon for us to fulfill the various tasks in the new 
situation. Party committees at all levels in the province 
should attach importance to and strengthen the party's united 
front work and, following the changes in the situation and 
tasks, continuously study the new conditions, put forward new 
demands, create new experiences, further consolidate and develop 
the broadest patriotic united front, and ensure the 
inexhaustible source of strength and the broad and solid mass 
foundation for reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  In his speech, Jiang Chunyun first emphasized the need to 
further enhance the understanding of the importance of the 
united front work in the new situation. He pointed out: The 
united front that our party established under the leadership of 
Comrade Mao Zedong was an important weapon for China to win 
victory in revolution and construction. In the new historical 
period, Comrade Deng Xiaoping led our party to again make new 
and significant contributions to consolidating and developing 
the united front and clearly defined it as an important 
component of the theory and practice of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward clear 
requirements on the united front work in the new situation and 
gave important instructions. We must profoundly understand the 
importance of the united front work in the new situation and 
continuously raise our awareness and have more initiative in 
making united front work successful. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Under the leadership of party 
committees at all levels, the united front work departments in 
the province have united the forces of all quarters and 
mobilized all positive factors to accomplish large amounts of 
fruitful work and achieve notable results in promoting 
Shandong's two civilizations over the past few years. The 
provincial party committee is satisfied with this. 
  Jiang Chunyun emphasized: As China's reform, opening up, and 
economic construction are in a crucial period, the position of 
united front becomes more important, and its role greater. It 
is a great historical task for the entire party and the people 
of various nationalities throughout the country to establish an 
initial system of the socialist market economy by the end of 
this century. Based on the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee and the reality of 
Shandong, the recent sixth provincial party congress defined the 
three-step strategic objective of Shandong's economic and social 
development. To attain this grand objective, we should unite 
all the forces that can be united, mobilize all positive 
factors, and strive to liberate and develop productive forces; 
we should address in a timely manner and correctly handle the 
various social contradictions to ensure social and political 
stability; and we should fully develop democracy, extensively 
give heed to the voice of the masses, strengthen supervision, 
and make sure that party and government organs at all levels are 
clean and honest and reduce and avoid major mistakes in 
policy-making. All these are basic functions and tasks of the 
patriotic united front in the new period. Jiang Chunyun pointed 
out: To make a success of the united front work in the new 
period, we should persistently take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line as the guide, conscientiously study to 
master the guidelines of the important instructions on united 
front work given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other 
central leading comrades, resolutely implement the party's 
principles and policies on the united front work, and, 
proceeding from Shandong's specific conditions and the overall 
situation in reform, development, and stability, develop the 
advantages, give prominence to work priorities, perform work in 
a creative manner, and strive to open up a new situation in the 
united front work and win new achievements continuously. 

    First, we should continue to improve and develop the system 
of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the 
leadership of the CPC, which is China's basic political system 
and also the major characteristic and advantage of the political 
system. Continuous improvement and development of this system 
is a need in strengthening and improving party leadership, a 
need in developing democratic politics with Chinese 
characteristics, and also a need in realizing long periods of 
order and stability of the state. Active participation of 
democratic parties and personages outside the party from various 
circles involved in consultation, discussion, and democratic 
supervision of the various policy-making groups for reform, 
opening up, and the modernization drive can help make 
policy-making more democratic and scientific. We should conduct 
full consultation with democratic parties and personages outside 
the party from various circles on major issues and ensure 
consultation before making policy. This should become a system 
and be conscientiously implemented. Recommending personages 
outside the party to assume leading posts in governments and 
judicial organs is the important work for adhering to and 
improving the system of multiparty cooperation and political 
consultation under party leadership and the important content of 
China's endeavor to develop democratic politics. Party 
committees at all levels should further enhance understanding, 
have a stronger sense of urgency toward this work, and adopt 
effective measures to make sure that new and significant 
progress is achieved in the job arrangements for cadres outside 
the party in the near future. We should cooperate with the 
cadres outside the party who have assumed government leading 
posts and make sure that they are entrusted with duties, powers, 
and responsibilities so that they can truly play their due role. 
  Second, united front work should be firmly focused on 
economic construction, the central task, and its advantages 
should be developed in order to improve service. The party's 
central task for the new period lies in economic construction, 
of which united front work should be geared. With the "three 
advantages" put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the 
criterion, we should emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, 
actively conduct exploration, adopt various measures, open up 
various channels, mobilize all positive factors, concentrate the 
will and forces of all nationalities, democratic parties, mass 
organizations, and personages from various circles on the grand 
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as much 
as possible, and strive to transform the advantages of united 
front, such as a galaxy of talent, extensive contacts, and large 
social influence, into actual productive forces. United front 
work departments should fully perform their functions, embody 
their characteristics and advantages, and place their work 
emphasis on creating a united, stable, and harmonious social 
environment conducive to reform, opening up, and economic 
construction and on participating in and discussing the 
administration of government and state affairs focusing on 
economic construction, offering ideas, serving as advisers, and 
providing good service. 
  Third, we should attach importance to the work for the 
representative personages outside the party. Party committees 
and united front work departments at all levels should consider 
it an important task. In particular, we should attach 
importance to and strengthen the work for nonparty 
intellectuals, representative personages of the nonpublic 
sectors of the economy, overseas targets of united front work, 
and representative figures from nationalities and religious 
circles. We should put the work of nonparty intellectuals in an 
important position. In connection with the work assigned them 
respectively, party and government leading comrades at all 
levels should make friends with the personages outside the 
party, define the scope and the targets, and strengthen contacts 
with them. Respect is the prerequisite for establishing 
friendship, treating others with sincerity is the channel for 
friendship, and mutual understanding is the bridge of 
friendship. We should respect, trust, and show concern for the 
friends outside the party. 

    Fourth, we should attach greater importance to and 
strengthen 
nationality and religious work. Party and government 
departments at all levels should fully understand the importance 
of achieving success in nationalities work, regard it as a major 
task, and conscientiously carry it out. The education on 
Marxism and the party's nationalities policies should be 
intensified within and outside the party, and communist party 
members, Communist Youth League members, cadres, and ordinary 
people of various nationalities should be educated to 
conscientiously implement the party's nationalities policies. 
We should adopt measures, such as support of certain projects, 
support by counterpart departments, and preferential policies to 
actively and effectively accelerate the economic and cultural 
development of minority nationalities to promote the common 
prosperity of all our nationalities. We should attach 
importance to training cadres of minority nationalities to 
continuously improve their political quality, professional 
proficiency, and their ability to participate in and lead 
economic construction. Party and government organs should 
comprehensively and correctly implement the party's policy on 
freedom of religious belief, strengthen management of religious 
affairs according to law, actively guide religions to comply 
with socialist modernization, and lead religious believers to 
make contributions to social stability and economic development. 
  In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The new conditions 
and new tasks have set new and still higher demands on united 
front work. To raise Shandong's united front work to a new 
level and open up a new situation, we should further strengthen 
and improve party leadership over united front work. Party 
committees at all levels should include united front work high 
in their agenda, discuss it several times a year, listen to 
reports, and study ways to resolve some major issues. Their 
chief leading comrades should take the lead in united front 
work, attend to it personally, and implement the party's united 
front work policies in an exemplary manner. Comrades in charge 
of united front work should conscientiously meet their 
responsibility and make earnest efforts to carry it out. United 
front work departments should fully perform their functions, 
serve as good advisers and assistants to party committees, and 
accomplish their specific work in an outstanding manner. We 
should conduct extensive and intensive propaganda and education 
on the theories and policies on united front work, increase the 
dynamics of the propaganda, and broaden the channels for it. 
Newspapers, radio, television, and other mass media should 
report and publicize the knowledge, work, and activities of 
united front, as well as the advanced deeds of the 
representative personages outside the party. Through propaganda 
and education, we should enhance people's understanding of 
united front work and strive to create a situation in which the 
entire party and society show concern for and attach importance 
to united front work. We should intensify investigation and 
study to learn about new conditions and resolve new problems. 
Firmly focusing on economic construction, the central task, we 
should make great efforts to study ways to guide specific work 
with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on united front and to make 
united front work meet the needs for establishing the socialist 
market economy system. We should conscientiously summarize the 
guiding experiences to counter the new conditions and new 
characteristics of united front work and offer valuable 
suggestions to guide and lead united front work to make new 
headway. United front work departments should attach importance 
to improving themselves and do a good job in division of work 
and cooperation. We should intensify the training and education 
of the cadres in charge of united front work, arm their minds 
with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, and strive to upgrade their 
theoretical, political, and professional quality. 
  Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of the province, presided over the 
conference and spoke on opinions on how to relay and implement 
the guidelines.

Pointed Out at the Shanghai Municipal Meeting on Rural Work: `It 
Is Necessary To Raise Agricultural and Rural Work to a New Level 
To Maintain a Good Trend of Sustained, Fast and Healthy 
Development of the Economy in Shanghai's Suburban Areas'"] 
  [Text] The municipal party committee and the municipal 
government yesterday held a meeting on rural work. The meeting 
called on cadres and masses in suburban areas and various trades 
of the municipality to further explore new ways for promoting 
reform, opening up, and economic development in the suburban 
areas of the extra large municipality from a higher plane with a 
more positive attitude, a broader vista, greater courage, and 
more solid measures in order to raise agricultural production, 
rural work, and the entire rural economy to a new level. 
  Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC 
Central 
Committee and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, 
gave an important speech at the meeting. Wu Bangguo first fully 
affirmed the achievements of the people in Shanghai's suburban 
areas, their basic experience, and the work of cadres. He said: 
Rural work in Shanghai's suburban areas registered good progress 
last year. The broad masses of cadres and people in the 
suburban areas have seriously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
emancipated their minds, adhered to the ideology of seeking 
truth from facts, and promoted a sustained, fast, and healthy 
development of the economy in Shanghai's suburban areas. The 
rural economy in Shanghai's suburban areas has become an 
important component part of economic development in the entire 
municipality and has also become an important part of Shanghai's 
economic growth. The achievements of rural work are the results 
of the hard work of the broad masses of cadres and people in the 
suburban areas and of support by various trades in Shanghai. On 
behalf of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, I wish to take 
this opportunity to extend my cordial regards and express my 
heartfelt gratitude to the broad masses of cadres and people in 
the suburban areas who have worked laboriously. 
  Wu Bangguo pointed out: To maintain social stability, we 
must promote economic development and attach importance to the 
"Shopping Basket" Project. In light of new problems that 
emerged in the "Shopping Basket" Project, we must carry out 
reform, develop production bases, improve the marketing system, 
and enforce macro control to ensure the supply of supplementary 
food products for the municipality. We should enrich the 
market, promote statiblity in society, and improve the people's 
living conditions. 
  Wu Bangguo emphatically pointed out: In the new year, we 
should seize the opportunity to deepen reform, further open up, 
promote development, ensure stability, raise agricultural 
production and rural work to a new level, and maintain a good 
trend of economic development in Shanghai's suburban areas. All 
trades and professions in society should show concern for and 
support agriculture and take the initiative to serve economic 
development in rural areas. We should firmly adhere to the 
policy of "grasping the two links and attaching equal importance 
to both." In line with the actual situation of rural work, we 
should strengthen the construction of party organizations at 
various levels in rural areas, pay attention to fostering an 
advanced culture and ideology, and build an honest government. 
We should show concern for the living conditions of the masses 
and unite with the broad masses of people in rural areas to 
jointly build a new socialist countryside. 
  Mayor Huang Ju also gave an important speech at the meeting. 
After fully affirming the great achievements in various work 
made by cadres and people in rural areas during 1993, Huang Ju 
pointed out the general guiding principle for this year's rural 
work. He said: We should fully implement the guidelines of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the 
Central Rural Conference, and the Second Plenary Meeting of the 
Sixth Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee; seize the opportunity to 
deepen reform, further open up, promote development, maintain 
stability; and strive to keep a good trend of sustained, fast, 
and healthy development of the rural economy. In promoting the 
development of the rural economy, we should give prominence to 
"one service and three coordinated actions." In other words, we 
should serve the "Shopping Basket" Project for Shanghai's urban 
residents and take coordinated actions with Shanghai's major 
industries, with Shanghai's large markets, and with Shanghai's 
foreign trade departments. 

    Huang Ju emphatically pointed out: This year's rural work 
has four main tasks: First, we should effectively strengthen 
agricultural work and firmly grasp the construction of the "two 
greens," namely promoting the production of green vegetables and 
planting trees. Second, we should further deepen reform, open 
up, and strive to achieve a new breakthrough in our work. 
Third, we should seriously draw up a blueprint for developing 
suburban areas and promoting the urbanization of rural areas 
step by step. Fourth, we should strive to raise peasants' 
income on the basis of developing the economy and protect 
peasants' enthusiasm for production. 
  Huang Ju said: We should stress promoting the production of 
green vegetables, achieve a breakthrough in developing vegetable 
gardens, and attach importance to greening projects to improve 
the ecology and environment in urban and rural areas. Those are 
major tasks to be firmly grasped in the next few years in 
Shanghai. We should spend three years to further raise the 
level of the "Shopping Basket" Project and establish a sound 
engineering system for it. We should explore new ways for 
developing the "Shopping Basket" Project to suit the needs of 
the internationalized metropolis [guo ji hua da du shi 0948 7139 
0553 1129 6757 1579] in the 1990's and the next century. We 
should protect the production bases for vegetables and other 
supplementary food products according to the 10-15 year plan, 
form a new management system for production and marketing, and 
implement various measures for developing the "Shopping Basket" 
Project in a solid manner. 
  This year, we should achieve the goal of greening an average 
of 1.4 square meters per person in the afforestation project and 
the total area of forest cover should reach 15 percent. We 
should plant trees on "four sides" [house side, village side, 
roadside and water side] in rural areas, strengthen the 
construction of forest belts along sea dikes, and develop flower 
gardens. In this way, we will be able to form a beautiful 
environment in all the suburban areas where "there are flowers 
in spring, shade from trees in summer, fruits in autumn, and 
green trees in winter." 
  Huang Ju called for raising the standard of development in 
the suburban areas this year and accelerating the urbanization 
of the countryside. He said: In making plans for various 
districts and areas, we should not limit the development plan 
within each county, but should coordinate with the overall 
strategic plan for Shanghai's development. We should make great 
efforts to improve infrastructure construction with special 
emphasis on road construction. Various counties should 
concentrate their financial power on building one or two main 
highways first; construct water, electric power and gas and 
other facilities; and strive to complete a relatively sound road 
network within the next two to three years. 
  Huang Hu also pointed out: Industry in the suburban areas 
has great vitality in Shanghai's economic development, and so we 
should concentrate our efforts and financial power on promoting 
industrial development in the suburban areas. Each county 
should start with the construction of a key industrial zone, and 
take on the new road of cooperation between counties, districts, 
and bureaus. We should give full play to our combined strength 
and strive to set up a number of enterprise groups with special 
characteristics. Meanwhile, we should seriously sum up 
experiences and actively promote the establishment of 
"Sino-foreign" joint ventures with funds from the agricultural 
and industrial sectors and foreign companies. In this way, we 
can raise the level, scale, and efficiency of village and town 
enterprises. 
  In conclusion, Huang Ju emphatically pointed out: Stability 
in agricultural production and rural areas is the foundation for 
stability in the entire society. The development of 
agricultural production and rural areas is an important part of 
Shanghai's overall society. Governments at various levels and 
other units should all consider the work of developing the rural 
economy and increasing the peasants' income as a starting point 
and standpoint. We should mobilize the whole municipality, 
promote cooperation, and raise the economic and social 
development in rural areas to a new level. 
  Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Wang Liping, deputy 
secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, and Vice 
Mayor Meng Jianzhu, respectively. Vice Mayor Xie Lijuan 
attended the meeting. Head of Minhang District Huang Furong and 
head of Qingpu County Li Jinsheng introduced their experiences 
in developing the rural economy at the meeting. Vice Mayor Meng 
Jianzhu disseminated the guidelines of the national conference 
on "Shopping Basket" Project and the production of grain, 
cotton, and edible oil.

  [Text] Shanghai, February 23 (XINHUA) -- While continuously 
absorbing foreign capital, Shanghai is striving to improve 
investment conditions to attract more domestic funds. 
  Altogether 4,641 enterprises from all parts of China 
invested 
a total of 15 billion yuan in this city, China's largest 
economic center, last year. 
  According to economists here, the surge of domestic 
investments in Shanghai can be characterized by the enthusiasm 
in the development of the New Pudong Area and the interest in 
service trade and transforming the old urban districts. 
  The New Pudong Area is a newly-established economic zone 
that 
is expected to lead in the transformation of Shanghai's 
industrial and financial sectors. 
  A survey shows that over 1,700 enterprises with a combined 
investment of 10 billion yuan from outside Shanghai settled in 
Pudong in 1993. 
  Regarding it as a new corridor to the market of the Pacific 
region, Anhui Province, which was hit by natural disasters over 
the past two years, still has invested large funds in Pudong. 
Many of the projects have now begun to make profits. 
  Among the 350 securities companies in Shanghai, 176 were 
founded by investors from outside Shanghai. The intensifying 
interest in real estate has brought 60 new projects to Pudong, 
with a total construction area of 1.5 million square meters. 
  Shanghai's nine urban districts have used domestic 
investment 
of more than 300 million yuan respectively, to transform old 
buildings and improve infrastructure facilities. 
  The business volume of enterprises from outside Shanghai 
topped 20.6 billion yuan in 1993, and they delivered 300 million 
yuan to the government in taxation last year.

<F P=106> [By Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member </F>
and Secretary of Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee: "Exercise 
Comprehensive Control, Improve Social Order--Excerpted From 2d 
Issue of CHANGAN (7022 1344) Magazine, 1994"] 
  [Text] How to successfully exercise comprehensive control 
over public security and improve social order has now become a 
major concern for the entire society. Over the past few years, 
with a view shaping a public security system, Guangdong has 
gradually gained a consensus from practice and carried out 
numerous explorations on ways to strengthen comprehensive 
control over public security. 
<H3>  I. The Complexity of Public Security Problems Requires Us 
To Exercise Comprehensive Control. </H3>
  The significance of maintaining a sound social order is 
known 
to all because it has a great bearing not only on the safety of 
thousands of thousands of families, and on the interests of 
millions of people, but also on bringing about a stable and 
sound environment for economic development and on the decisions 
of foreign businessmen to run factories, do business, and go 
sightseeing in China. Meanwhile, it is also a very serious 
political issue which will produce a direct impact on the 
confidence of the masses in upholding the four cardinal 
principles and in carrying out reform and opening up. That is 
why we have never relaxed our efforts in exercising control over 
public security. However, despite the arduous efforts we have 
made, the public security situation still remains quite grim. 
This fact serves to show the complexity, severity, and 
protractedness of our work to keep tight control over public 
security, which is actually a tough social system project 
involving many aspects of social life. Therefore, we cannot 
succeed in our work if we just simply launch a few campaigns or 
rely on the strength of one or two departments. To find 
effective solutions to security problems, what we must do is to 
acquire a correct understanding of the protractedness and 
severity of the work, and persistently exercise comprehensive 
control over public security. 
  First, the public security situation involves various 
complicated social factors. With complicated ideological and 
social roots of various sorts, different violations of the law 
are a comprehensive reflection and the result of interactions of 
the negative factors existing in many fields in society, 
including the political, economic, ideological, and cultural 
fields. Such violations are born of many adverse objective or 
subjective influences which exist in the country or come from 
outside the country. Problems generated from various 
complicated factors have to be dealt with comprehensively from 
various angles and using different measures. 
  Second, we should have a correct understanding of the many 
rampant, stubborn, and repetitive negative factors which can 
lead to security problems. Both international and domestic 
political struggles are protracted in nature, as is the 
corrosive influence from decadent ideologies and cultures of the 
declining classes in the ideological field. For a considerably 
long period of commodity economic development, the influence of 
negative factors inherent in the commodity economy has also been 
protracted. To resist and eliminate these influences, we must 
be prepared for an extended struggle, undergo repeated trials of 
strength, and never relax our efforts. 
  Third, during the process of reform, the shift of the new 
and 
old economic structures, readjustments of interest relations, 
and changes in people's ideological concepts have inevitably 
given rise to many contradictions and frictions, as well as 
various factors leading to security problems. Since it takes 
the lead in reform and is also on the forefront of opening up, 
Guangdong may be the first to face more conspicuous and severe 
problems in public security. Various criminal activities are 
running rampant in the province and lawbreakers coming from 
inland areas as well as triad forces from outside China have 
committed many crimes, including drug-trafficking and 
drug-taking, prostitution and patronizing prostitutes, 
smuggling, robbery, and blackmail. All these problems keep 
surfacing despite repeated bans, adding greater difficulties to 
our control over public security. Under such circumstances, we 
can attain greater results only when we make greater efforts to 
unswervingly give full rein to all social forces and fight in 
coordination when exercising comprehensive control over public 
security. 
<H3>  II. Give Play to Superiorities and Exercise Comprehensive 
Control Over Public Security </H3>
  Exercising comprehensive control over public security is a 
societywide system project mainly characterized by integrating: 
Special campaigns and the strength of the masses; central and 
local supervisions; the efforts of the province itself and its 
coordination with other provinces and foreign countries; 
anticorruption struggles inside the party and the elimination of 
evil-doing in society; and integrating short-term campaigns of 
"severely cracking down on criminal activities" and "elimination 
of seven evils" on the one hand and long-term efforts of 
comprehensive control on the other. As regards the concrete 
methods used by the system project, party and government leading 
organs will coordinate all sides concerned and strive to bring 
about a comprehensive effect by making use of various political, 
economic, administrative, legal, educational, and cultural 
means. Judging by the realistic situation in Guangdong, a 
number of localities have done a good job in exercising 
comprehensive control and their experience can be summarized as 
follows: "Developing the economy, intensifying functions, 
arousing the masses to exercise comprehensive control, paying 
attention to education, and reinforcing management." 
--Developing the economy. A better economy can 
enable the masses to live in peace and comfort, ease up various 
social contradictions, lay a foundation for reducing crime, and 
provide conditions for increasing security input and upgrading 
the necessary equipment. Therefore, we have persistently paid 
attention to developing the economy and regarded and carried out 
the work as a basic task of the system project of comprehensive 
control. 
  --Intensifying functions. This means that we need 
to give full play to the functions and roles of organs of 
dictatorship, as well as the dual role of the law in protecting 
the people and cracking down on criminal activities. The 
procuratorial and judicial contingents are backbone forces in 
the work of comprehensive control. Therefore, we need to 
strengthen the building of these contingents in real terms and 
we must not begrudge the money spent on reinforcing police 
forces and upgrading their equipment. It is imperative to 
enhance the political and professional qualities of 
procuratorial and judicial workers, help them improve their 
skills in struggling against crime, and nurture procuratorial 
and judicial personnel who are able to act in strict accordance 
with the law, handle cases with a high efficiency, and refrain 
from acting impetuously or using penalties instead of adopting 
legal actions. With coalitions between provinces and 
municipalities, and between local governments and such special 
departments as the railway and customs, we will make continued 
efforts to carry out the campaign of "severely cracking down on 
criminal activities," as well as other special-purpose 
struggles, and strike relentless blows at criminal activities of 
various sorts. 
  --Arousing the masses to carry out comprehensive 
control over public security. The masses comprise the 
biggest deterrent force against criminals and evildoers. To 
prevent crime, we should not only rely on professional 
contingents but also arouse and organize the forces of the 
masses in an extensive way. By so doing, we can spread a 
dragnet so that the criminals have no way to escape. Judging 
from Guangdong's practice, we have mainly paid attention to the 
following several links: 1) A joint defense has been set up by 
the army, police, and militia. Security patrols, factory and 
neighborhood joint defense commands, and residential quarters' 
security squads have been organized in urban areas, with militia 
patrols and peasants' joint defense commands in rural areas. 
All these security-keeping units are on patrol duty round the 
clock in key districts, sections, and units; open and covered 
sentinels have been posted in hotbeds of criminal cases; and a 
patrol duty system as well as police information posts have been 
set up in all neighborhoods, buildings, residential quarters, 
and key vital communication lines. 2) Giving full play to the 
roles of security teams in public places, especially hotels, 
shopping malls, and banks, and establishing a strict internal 
management system. 3) Setting up and perfecting the militia and 
joint defense organizations and bringing the roles of these 
grass-roots organs into full play. 4) Setting up antigambling 
and antidrug associations across the rural areas, organizing 
youths and women and helping them enter contracts and supervise 
each other in the struggle against gambling and drugs. 5) 
Encouraging the masses to exercise supervision, inform against 
lawbreakers, and to give assistance in cracking criminal cases. 
We need to commend and give people handsome rewards for their 
heroic behavior and their contribution to solving criminal 
cases, thus creating a general social mood that "everybody has 
responsibility for maintaining sound social order." 6) 
Earnestly strengthening management over the floating population 
and apartments rented by the hour. 7) Carrying out 
rectification in areas and units where there are relatively more 
problems to prevent them from becoming criminal dens. Practice 
has proved that all these measures are workable and effective 
and have played an important role in maintaining public security 
and stability in our province. 
  --Paying attention to education. The process of 
comprehensive control, viewed from a vertical angle, mainly 
consists of three links: Preventing and cracking down on crimes 
and transforming criminals. Of the three, prevention and 
transformation are positive measures. To reach the goal of 
preventing crimes and checking the reemergence of crime, a 
fundamental way is to do a good job in ideological, ethical, and 
cultural education and enhancing the ideological, ethical, and 
cultural qualities of the people. Therefore, we should regard 
education as a system task and provide people of different ages 
with education at different levels. Particularly, we should pay 
great attention to teenagers and youths, for it is the need of 
comprehensive control and the need of rearing a generation of 
people of a new type. We should strengthen ideological and 
ethical education in schools, education on vocational ethics in 
enterprises, and education on social morality and the legal 
system in the entire society, to bring about a favorable turn in 
the general mood of society. We should base our education on 
problems emerging during reform and opening up, guide the masses 
to resist the adverse influence of the negative factors of the 
commodity economy, guard against erosion from the incorrect 
concept of "evaluating everything in terms of money" and become 
rich through legalized operations and honest labor. Careful 
ideological education, mediation, and guidance are also required 
in solving contradictions and disputes among the people, so that 
these contradictions and disputes do not turn into security 
problems. Departments in charge of reeducating criminals through 
labor should work together with society; give full play to the 
roles of enterprises, neighborhoods, townships, and villages in 
reeducating and transforming criminals; and do a good job in 
arranging the resettlement and employment of personnel who have 
undergone reeducation through labor. In addition, we also need 
to adopt vivid forms to enable the masses to educate themselves. 
--Reinforcing management. Setting up and perfecting 
rules and regulations on social security and management is a 
basic task of comprehensive control. With strict rules and 
regulations, as well as careful implementation, we can plug all 
loopholes and eliminate all evildoing in the light of the 
system. First of all, we need to set up a target responsibility 
system and implement the target down to the grass-roots levels 
by translating the general target of security into various 
concrete and workable goals, requirements, and measures in 
accordance with the principle that: "Whoever takes charge 
should assume the responsibility." Leaders at all levels as well 
as persons in charge of grass-roots units should take charge of 
security affairs and regard security work as one of the contents 
of the target responsibility system during their tenure. 
Second, efforts should be made to set up and perfect various 
concrete management systems, including management of floating 
and temporary population; of guest houses, cabarets, roadside 
inns, and apartments rented by the hour; of financial and 
accounting; of outward remittances; and the management of 
passports, frontier permits, and documents for multiple visits 
to Hong Kong and Macao. Third, we should set up various 
corresponding inspection and supervision systems and firmly 
check violations of rules and regulations. Country rules on 
maintaining social order should also be extensively drawn up in 
rural areas. 
  All the aforementioned measures are interrelated and 
inseparable and not a single one of them can be dispensed with. 
Only by successfully mobilizing the entire society, taking 
concerted efforts, and doing a good job at every link can we 
bring about effective solutions to public security problems. 
<H3>  III. Strengthening Leadership and Coordinating the Work of 
All Sides </H3>
  Comprehensive control over public security is a common task 
for the entire society. To properly coordinate the forces of 
all sides, we need a powerful command center. Therefore, party 
committees and governments at all levels should place the work 
of comprehensively controlling public security on their major 
agenda; devote a great deal of effort, time, and resources to 
the work; reinforce concrete guidance; ensure the implementation 
of all measures; and set up corresponding work organs. 
Departments under the party and mass system, including party 
and youth league organizations, trade unions, women's 
federations, and the militia; sectors on the propaganda, 
cultural, and education front, including the press, publication, 
films, television, broadcasting, schools, and hospitals; organs 
on the procuratorial and judicial front, including public 
security organs, procuratorates, people's courts, judicial 
organs, and departments in charge of reeducation through labor; 
and government departments, including industrial and commercial 
bureaus, taxation departments, banks, audition departments, and 
the customs should all work together to make the work a success. 
Party committees and governments at all levels should draw up 
unified work plans on the comprehensive control of public 
security and strengthen, in particular, the building of 
grass-roots organizations. If we succeed in the building of 
leading bodies at the grass-roots level, we can surely fulfill 
the task of comprehensive control down to every grass-roots 
organization. 
  Whether or not the command center of comprehensive control 
over public security can work with high efficiency and high 
authority depends on whether or not it can perform an exemplary 
role in observing and acting in strict accordance with the law. 
Therefore, party and government leaders at all levels should 
integrate comprehensive control of public security with the work 
of opposing corruption and maintaining a clean administration. 
So long as the leaders succeed in taking a good lead, the 
entire system project of comprehensive control can be carried 
through efficiently and all problems with public security can be 
solved properly.

underground railroad, the west coast expressway, the Guangdong 
section of the Beijing-Hankou- Guangzhou optical fiber cable, 
the Feilei Xia key water control project, and the Dahe reservoir. 
  Speaking of price control, provincial Governor Zhu Senlin 
remarked: Given the growing state construction scale and the 
deepening price reform, commodity prices are bound to go up. 
Thus we should make every possible endeavor to force price 
hikes to stay at an appropriate level. To this end, governments 
at all levels across the province should intensify macroeconomic 
regulation, control, and management of commodity prices; persist 
in and perfect the existing price control responsibility system; 
strengthen market price supervision and examination; further 
both distribution and wage system reform among enterprises, 
administrative organs, and undertakings; and enable people to 
earn more on the basis of expanded production.

  [Text] Guangdong will invest 15 billion yuan (HK$13.3 
billion) this year to upgrade its highways, but Beijing has 
already indicated it will only make a token contribution, a 
provincial official said yesterday. Li Peiwu, director of the 
province's Communications and Traffic Bureau, said Beijing would 
only promise to provide 300 million to 400 million yuan. He 
said the provincial Government would offer 3.1 billion yuan, 
while at least 10 billion yuan would have to be shared by county 
and municipal governments. The remaining money would come from 
foreign investors. 
  Facing another deficit this year, analysts said the Central 
Government had already demanded provinces such as Guangdong to 
make a greater contribution to the central coffers. The sharing 
of tax revenue and the annual financial contribution to the 
state coffers by the provinces were two major issues in the tug 
of war between regions and the central authorities under the new 
tax reform programme introduced by Executive Vice-Premier Zhu 
Rongji. Under the tax policy Beijing regained control over much 
of the revenue that had been monopolised by localities in the 
past. 
  Speaking to reporters while attending the continuing 
Guangdong People's Congress, Mr Li said the province would be 
able to meet its financial needs despite the lack of financial 
support from Beijing. He said much of the investment would come 
from bank credit and he did not expect the financing would lead 
to more taxes and levies. 
  There were reports that many local chiefs raised taxes and 
imposed new fees on villagers to finance road construction. The 
added financial burden has been a source of confrontation in the 
country side. According to Mr Li, an other channel for 
financing came from the floating of new bonds and stocks. For 
example, the Guangdong Highway Company is considering issuing 
new stocks to the public to raise part of the investment money. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Li admitted the traffic problem in Guangdong 
had been worsened by the influx of millions of migrant worker 
after the Spring Festival. However, the total volume attributed 
to the arrival of job-seekers was about eight percent down so 
far this year. He attributed the drop to an increasing number 
of migrant workers taking special coaches chartered by their 
employers.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong 
Province will become an even more attractive "hot spot" for 
overseas investors with the deepening of various new reforms, 
Vice Provincial Governor Lu Ruihua said here today. 
  Two new reforms involve foreign investors, namely, the 
reform 
of the taxation system and the reform of the foreign exchange 
management system, Lu told a news conference. 
  These reforms are beneficial to overseas investors because 
they are designed to adapt China to the global market, he 
explained. 
  According to Lu, Guangdong's unique advantages in wooing 
overseas investors include a relatively developed market 
economy, a fast pace of reforms and preferential policies 
granted by the central authorities. 
  "More importantly, Guangdong Province is near Hong Kong and 
Macao and is the ancestral home of millions of our Hong Kong, 
Macao and Taiwan compatriots, overseas Chinese and foreigners of 
Chinese origin," he said. 
  These advantages have enabled Guangdong to score rapid 
progress in its economic and trade cooperation with the rest of 
the world, he said. 
  He cited the following facts to illustrate Guangdong's 
achievements: 
  -- Guangdong's exports soared by 46 percent to 27 billion 
U.S. dollars in 1993, roughly 29 percent of China's total 
exports; 
  -- Its imports shot up by 71 percent to 19.1 billion 
dollars, 
20 percent of China's total imports; and 
  -- It introduced 9.65 billion dollars in overseas funds last 
year, 40 percent of the country's total. 
  To date, the province has brought in a total of 29.6 billion 
dollars in overseas funds, excluding the Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Station, Lu Ruihua said. 
  He invited more overseas companies to invest in Guangdong in 
such areas as the power industry, ports, railways, roads, 
airports, automobiles, metallurgy, electronics, chemicals, new 
materials, biological engineering, farm and sideline products 
processing, export-led processing, and services.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou] </F>
  [Text] Senior officials in Guangdong yesterday expressed 
concern that their battle against inflation might fail this 
year. Speaking at a special session with about 30 delegates to 
the Guangdong People's Political Consultative Conference at the 
state Zhudao Guesthouse yesterday, Executive Vice-Governor Lu 
Ruihua, admitted they faced a tough battle. Representatives 
attending the annual conference session, however, still pressed 
the senior leader to keep inflation down. 
  In his Government Work Report tabled at the Guangdong 
People's Congress last week, Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin said 
the Government hoped to keep inflation within 12 percent this 
year. Last year's inflation rate stood at 18.6 per cent. 
  Mr Zhu last year insisted that this year's target could be 
achieved if strenuous efforts were made. But the Governor's 
right hand man, Mr Lu, said the government was shorthanded to 
keep prices down to that level. He told conference delegates 
the government felt it was sandwiched between enterprises and 
consumers in its fight against inflation. The Vice-Governor 
said while some enterprises pressed the government to take a 
hands-off approach, consumers wanted more aggressive measures. 
  The Government faced an awkward situation because it was 
obliged to raise prices of farmers' harvests to protect their 
interests but also had to keep prices of staple food at a 
reasonable level. In addition, the Vice Governor admitted the 
value-added tax introduced by Beijing had led to price hoarding 
in some areas, further deepening the inflation crisis. But he 
reiterated the Government would take every possible means to 
ensure a stable market and keep the prices of vegetables, grain, 
and oil down. 
  But Mr Lu's assurances apparently failed to satisfy some of 
the representatives, who kept urging the Government to strike a 
better deal with Beijing on fiscal arrangements. A Guangdong 
Industrial and Commercial Bank representative said Guangdong 
should forge one step ahead of other provinces in reforming the 
banking sector. He feared that Guangdong might lose its 
competitive edge because Beijing has indicated it will give 
priority to key infrastructure projects and large state owned 
enterprises in 1994.

21 February: "Price Situation in Guangdong Is Still Grim This 
Year"] 
  [Text] Although Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin has made a 
commitment to people's congress deputies that every effort will 
be made to keep price hikes at around 12 percent this year, the 
grim price situation is still an issue of general concern to the 
participants. This is because historical experience shows that 
it: will be by no means easy to attain this objective. 
<H5>  Prices Rose by 18 Percent Last Year </H5>
  A few days ago, the Guangdong Commodity Prices Bureau 
provided deputies attending the Guangdong Provincial People's 
Congress meeting with a document on the market price situation. 
According to the document, Guangdong's general index of retail 
prices last year rose by 18.2 percent over the previous year. 
Market prices rose considerably across the province, with hefty 
increases registered at the beginning and end of the year and 
prices stabilizing in the middle of the year. 
  According to analyses, the steep price increases in 
Guangdong 
last year were caused by economic growth, the introduction of 
various reforms, and other normal factors, and by natural 
disasters, artificial, and other abnormal factors. Through hard 
work, the momentum of excessive price hikes has been curbed to a 
certain extent, but the planned control target was still 
exceeded by 8.2 percentage points. 
  The principal cause of Guangdong's consistently high prices 
was rapid economic and investment growth. The originally 
planned price control target was determined according to planned 
growth of 12 percent in Guangdong's GNP. In fact, Guangdong's 
GNP grew by 21 percent last year, which was certainly reflected 
in the general index of retail prices. Rapid economic growth 
gave rise to rapid investment and credit growth. On the one 
hand, this led directly to hefty increases in the price of 
capital goods, especially steel products and cement; on the 
other hand, as some 40 percent of the investment was turned into 
consumption funds, pressures to raise prices increased, bringing 
about a hefty increase in the price of relevant products. In 
terms of the macro environment, this determined that Guangdong's 
general index of retail prices outstripped the originally 
planned control target by a big margin last year. 
<H5>  Great Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Swap Prices </H5>
  Last year, the state increased the weight of reform, 
readjusted tax rates, allowed exchange price fluctuations, and 
carried out price reform. All these have also directly 
contributed to price hikes in Guangdong. For example, the state 
raised the retail sales tax rate from 3 to 5 percent. As retail 
prices for over 90 percent of commodities in Guangdong were 
subjected to market regulation, the increase in tax rates was 
also reflected in prices. Moreover, as a lot of operators also 
jumped on the bandwagon, the actual impact was greater than had 
been theoretically estimated. 
  Besides, foreign exchange swap prices fluctuated wildly last 
year. As Guangdong imported large amounts of energy, raw and 
semifinished materials, and household electrical products, a 
drop in the exchange rate directly drove up prices of these 
commodities by a big margin, and, at the same time, caused some 
people to expect that the renminbi would be devalued. With the 
acceleration of price reform across the nation, prices of most 
commodities, such as grain, steel products, and coal, were 
liberalized, and prices of railway cargo transport were also 
adjusted upward substantially. The impact was especially 
serious in Guangdong, which principally relies on imports of 
energy materials and raw and semifinished materials from other 
provinces and which sells most of its products to other 
provinces. 
  Guangdong was repeatedly hit by natural calamities last 
year. 
What with the low-temperature cold front at the beginning of the 
year and typhoons and rainstorms in the middle of the year, 
there was a sharp drop in the output of fruit, vegetables, and 
grain. This exacerbated the contractions caused by supply 
falling short of demand. The impact of natural calamities on 
vegetables, in particular, was most severe, and vegetable prices 
soared three times. Furthermore, some localities relaxed or 
neglected the "shopping basket" project by turning vast tracts 
of vegetable fields into real estate. As newly cultivated 
vegetable fields are remote and their output is low, vegetable 
prices tended to rise when natural calamities occurred. 
<H3>  Artificial or Indiscriminate Collection of Fees Adds Fuel to 
the Flames </H3>
  Artificial or indiscriminate price increases and collection 
of fees also contributed to rising prices. For a time last 
year, the phenomena of jumping on the bandwagon and artificially 
forcing up prices were rampant in Guangdong, but they were 
curbed by the provincial government through vigorous 
rectifications. By late November last year, however, because 
some newspapers erroneously reported that grain was in short 
supply and grain prices were likely to rise, and because some 
rice traders and self-employed grain shops took advantage of the 
opportunity to jack up prices, the price of rice soared in the 
short space of half a month and in Guangzhou rose by about 60 
percent. 

    Maintaining the basic stability of market prices bears 
heavily on social and economic stability. Last year, Guangdong 
Province took measures to curb wanton price increases, such as 
organizing a general inspection of fees collection and commodity 
prices across the province, seizing the right time to introduce 
price reform in light of the market price situation to reduce 
the impact on prices, and doing a good job in the production of 
staple food to stabilize prices of those commodities that bear 
heavily on the people's well-being. 
  Guangdong also stepped up controls over the collection of 
administrative and operational fees in accordance with the law. 
According to statistics, in the first 11 months of last year, a 
total of 2,189 fee collection items were abolished and another 
608 rectified in the province as a whole, thus reducing social 
burdens by about 300 million yuan. Moreover, individual 
dynamic, direct management at different levels was also 
administered toward prices of commodities and services that are 
monopolies, mandatory, and protective and have public welfare 
characteristics. 
<H5>  Establish Price Regulation and Control System </H5>
  Looking ahead into the new year, the price situation in 
Guangdong will still be very grim because many reform projects 
will be introduced and the economy is still growing at a fairly 
high speed. The various price hike factors have not been 
eliminated. For example, in reforming the taxation system and 
readjusting the tax burden structure, tax reduction does not 
necessarily lead to price reductions and a rise in taxes will be 
shifted onto prices. The current overheated social demand will 
also drive up the price level. 
  Wen Wuhan, secretary general of the Guangdong Commodity 
Prices Association, gave an incisive analysis of the strong 
motives behind the government's attempt to "control commodity 
prices." In his view, of the price reform aimed at establishing 
a socialist market economic structure, liberalizing competitive 
prices constitutes only part of the price reform. What is more 
important and arduous is to establish a price regulation and 
control system suited to a market economy. Viewed from this 
angle, price reform still has a long way to go. 
  He stressed: First, it is necessary to make clear that the 
objective of reform is to establish, under state macroeconomic 
regulation and control, a price structure based on fixed market 
prices so that the government can regulate and control the 
market, the market can fix prices, and prices can guide 
enterprises. Second, it is necessary to have corresponding 
economic, legal, and administrative means to exercise regulation 
and control over prices, and to place these reform tasks on the 
government's agenda. If we pay attention only to price 
controls, we are likely to return to the old path of direct 
regulation and control.

  [Text] A senior Guangdong official yesterday reassured 
property developers that their investments in the province would 
be protected, in spite of a new tax introduced by Beijing. Yuan 
Zheng, director general of the Lands Department of Guangdong 
said although the province would follow Beijing's order and 
implement the Capital Gains Tax, the Government was confident 
the new levy would not jeopardise investors' interests. "I 
don't think the impact will be serious. The formulation of the 
new tax will have to protect the healthy development of the real 
estate market. So (I believe Beijing) will be very prudent in 
formulating the (tax)," he said. 
  The controversial levy, only briefly mentioned in government 
reports tabled at the ongoing Provincial People's Congress, 
might trigger fresh friction between the central Government and 
regions. Regional cadres have indicated that foreign investors 
should be given a "reasonable return" for putting their money 
into the property market in face of the higher risk involved. 
Mr Yuan said the mainland's property development would also 
suffer if foreign investors were unable to make a profit on 
their investments. 
  The official said the Government would continue to give 
priority to basic infrastructure projects in its land-use 
programme, although Guangdong still faced an insatiable demand 
for houses. It was unlikely that projects signed before this 
year would be affected by the new tax, he said. According to 
him, a set of detailed regulations on the implementation of the 
tax which will be promulgated by Beijing soon, will help clarify 
certain controversies over the new levy. They would take into 
account factors such as inflation, loan costs, and project risks 
for developers. 
  Property transactions contributed 11 billion yuan (HK$9.76 
billion) to government coffers last year and the sum was not 
included in the Government's Budget. The Government has 
earmarked 8,240 hectares of land to be sold through auction and 
tender to real estate developers this year. Mr Yuan also said 
Guangdong would control the development of golf courses in the 
province. He admitted there was already an oversupply and said 
authorities would limit each city to one or two courses.

  [Text] Guangdong will try to maintain its competitive edge 
by imposing more, not less, control over the economy, according 
to its Executive Vice-Governor, Lu Ruihua. Contrary to popular 
belief that Guangdong will further dismantle the "birdcage" 
imposed by Beijing over the operation of the economy, Mr Lu said 
the province would stay in tune with the central authorities in 
the next round of reform. 
  In financial reform Guangdong will seek to establish an 
overseas Chinese bank and a provincial bank. 
  Guangdong shared much of the same policies with other 
provinces in areas such as restrictions on foreign financial 
institutions, control over the retail market, and a state 
monopoly over the telecommunications industry. 
  Mr Lu defended Beijing's latest reform measures on tax 
revenue and exchange rates, saying these policies would help set 
a level playing field for all competitors. 
  Guangdong, according to the Vice-Governor, was still special 
because it had a better economic foundation more experience in 
the operation of a market economy and close proximity to Hong 
Kong. "Central versus regional", and "liberalisation versus 
controls", are two major themes dominating the Eighth Guangdong 
People's Congress. While many congress delegates urged the 
provincial government to Strike a better deal with Beijing over 
issues such as taxation and banking reform, an equally large 
contingent demanded a more aggressive government in dealing with 
inflation. 
  Although Mr Lu admitted Guangdong was haunted by inflation, 
he said this was the price the province had to pay in order to 
develop. "High-speed growth will always lead to a certain degree 
of inflation. But I believe this is better than keeping prices 
at a very low level and a stagnated growth rate. The question 
now is whether the government can adopt effective measures to 
keep price increases in check." 
  These measures, according to the Vice-Governor, include 
strict control over capital investments and retail markets and 
increased supplies of staple products. He claimed these 
restrictive policies would not hurt foreign investors and 
promised no change to the five-year tax breaks promised in 
China's joint-venture law.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 24 (XINHAU) -- Some domestic 
and foreign businesses in Guangzhou, the capital city of south 
China's Guangdong Province, will be able to sell or transfer 
their property rights freely on the market beginning in April or 
May, according to Guo Xiling, chairman of the city's Planning 
Commission. 
  The property rights exchange, which will be built in two 
months in this south China economic center, will be under the 
management of the city government. 
  Latest figures show that there are now 25 property rights 
exchanges in China, with the first one formed in the early 1980s. 
  Chen Kaizhi, vice-mayor of the city, said that all 
state-owned enterprises in the city will be transformed into 
corporations in the next four or five years. 
  Except for a number of public utilities like transportation 
and telecommunications systems, most of the state-owned 
enterprises will take the form of stock companies, Chen added. 
  Chen also mentioned that in line with the reform of property 
rights, the city will establish some state-owned asset 
management companies to take charge of managing, transferring 
and auction of the state-owned assets of state-owned enterprises. 
  Guangzhou now has more than 20,000 enterprises, more than 
4,000 of which are involved in industrial production. 
  Official sources said that this move is partly aimed at 
revitalizing some loss-making state-owned enterprises which have 
been in the red a long time because of limitations on 
transferring property rights.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou] </F>
  [Text] China's special economic zones [SEZ] -- Shenzhen, 
Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen and Hainan -- have demanded that Beijing 
give them greater economic power so they can stay ahead of other 
parts of the country in reform, Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda said 
yesterday. The plea, he said, was made at a recent national 
meeting on SEZs in Zhuhai attended by central government 
officials. "There are some powers that we believe should be 
delegated to the SEZs.... Power over the vetting of some 
projects should belong to the zones. Now the vetting process is 
too complicated," he said. 
  "These powers have been recentralised during the economic 
rectification and much (of the sharing of power between central 
government and the SEZs) has yet to smooth out. In order to 
allow the SEZs to go one step ahead in reform, these powers and 
conditions should return to the zones," he added. According to 
the mayor the SEZs should have the authority to approve most 
investment projects and investors should be spared the trouble 
of applying to Beijing for their investment. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Liang confirmed that Zhuhai has for the time 
being shelved its plan to build the Lingdingyang Bridge linking 
Zhuhai with Hong Kong. But he said the SEZ, which borders 
Macao, has already started the construction of the Qiao and 
Lingdingyang sections. He said these sections were necessary to 
the development of the island resources of Zhuhai. 
  The project has been delayed partly because of a shortage of 
funds and queries by Beijing over the technicalities of the 
project. Mr Liang said Beijing had asked Zhuhai to conduct more 
feasibility research and at one point suggested Zhuhai consider 
the option of building a tunnel instead of a bridge. 
  "But we have restudied the idea and still believe that the 
bridge is a better option." Tunnels, he said, were more 
vulnerable to disasters such as earthquakes and they cost more. 
  According to Mr Liang, at least eight consortiums had 
expressed interest in the bridge project and negotiations were 
under way. While he said the Government would guarantee 
investors a reasonable return, Zhuhai would not lease out the 
islands to those who invested in building the bridges.

"Grain Output and Income Increases for Guangxi Peasants"] 
  [Text] The growth rates of Guangxi's total agricultural 
output value for the last three years have all been higher than 
the national average, and increases in grain output have 
continued into the fourth year. Despite a smaller crop acreage 
for 1993, the total output value that year still exceeded 1992, 
a bumper harvest year, by 291,000 tonnes. The peasants' 
per-capita net income for last year rose for the first time to 
860 yuan, the national level of peasant income. Closely related 
to peasant income, township and town enterprises also achieved 
major breakthroughs and a 115.39 percent increase in total 
output value last year. 
  Government officials in charge of agricultural affairs here 
characterized last year's agricultural economy as "simultaneous 
growth on three fronts:" Simultaneous growth in total 
agricultural output value and peasants' per-capita income; in 
grain and cash crops; and in farming and breeding industries. 
The rural economy has been developing steadily every year in 
this ethnic autonomous region, which previously lagged behind in 
economic development. Zhao Fulin, secretary of the Guangxi 
Regional CPC Committee, pointed out in analyzing the recent 
increasing momentum of growth of the region's rural economy: 
Guangxi has done much in recent years to strengthen rural work, 
improve and adjust rural economic structures, and develop 
township and town enterprises and has achieved much in 
developing sub-tropical forestry and orchard cultivation and 
concentrating on its strong points. From this, Zhao Fulin felt 
that, as long as the road is right and the measures implemented 
are effective, the provinces and regions which got a late start 
can also eliminate poverty and become comparatively well-off, 
and the prospect of tens of thousands of peasants getting rich 
is not so remote.

billion yuan (about 666 million U.S. dollars), 66.7 percent more 
than in 1992. 
  With the completion of some of the projects, the region 
increased its electric power generating capacity to 563,000 kw 
and port handling capacity to 2.7 million tons in 1993. 
  Some 400 kilometers of highways and five optical fiber cable 
lines, with a total length of 2,000 kilometers, were built last

the region's telecommunications network. 
  The financial and banking departments have give full support 
to the construction of key projects. 
  The regional branch of the Construction Bank of China issued 
3.3 billion yuan more of loans for the projects.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "We Must Have Lofty Ambitions and </F>
Great Ideals"] 
  [Text] From time immemorial it has been true that those 
who intend to accomplish something magnificent must have lofty 
ambitions. Establishing a socialist market economic system is a 
great cause without precedent in history, and there is no 
ready-made experience which we can make use of. We will 
inevitably encounter some difficulties and problems which we 
have never experienced in the past. It is particularly 
imperative for us to aim high and have lofty ambitions. We must 
be bold in making explorations and blazing new trails. Without 
lofty ambitions and great ideals, without pioneering spirit, 
without the spirit of "taking a risk," and without a burst of 
energy and vigor, we cannot break a good, new path and 
accomplish something new. 
  At present, the broad masses of party members, cadres, and 
the people are further emancipating their minds, seizing the 
good opportunity, deepening reform, and struggling hard to 
establish a socialist market economic system and develop a 
socialist market economy. The situation is encouraging and 
presses us to march forward courageously. Some comrades, 
however, are lacking great ideals and ambition. They lack both 
a vigorous spirit and an energetic drive. 
  Some comrades like to compare our province, Hunan, with some 
provinces and regions, such as Guangdong, which are experiencing 
fairly rapid economic development. They always complain that we 
are backward in this respect or no good in that regard. In 
fact, they are mistakenly belittling themselves. There gaps 
truly do exist between us, Hunan, and those coastal provinces 
and regions. For example, if we compare ourselves with Jiangsu, 
we lag behind in township and town enterprises. If we compare 
ourselves with Zhejiang, we lag behind in individual and private 
economy. If we compare ourselves with Guangdong, we lag behind 
in foreign-funded enterprises. If we compare ourselves with the 
entire coastal area, we lag behind in the emancipation of the 
mind. However, we must on no account unduly underestimate our 
own capabilities, despite these gaps. We should realize that 
Hunan's economic development is not slow. Last year, our 
township and town enterprises got on the "expressway." Our 
foreign-funded enterprises, tertiary industry, and individual 
and private economy have been developing fairly rapidly. Our 
GNP has been increasing at the highest speed since reform and 
opening up. We do not object to comparing ourselves with 
economically advanced coastal provinces and regions. The 
purpose of this comparison, however, is not only to discover the 
gaps; it is undertaken in order to make an analysis of the 
reasons contributing to the gaps and study measures for 
narrowing and eliminating them. Material dialectics have told us 
that all things develop and change under certain conditions. As 
long as we take a correct path and go all out in our efforts, 
the gaps can be narrowed. The backward can definitely become 
the advanced. We must aim high, have lofty ambitions, and learn 
to use the views of material dialectics to exhibit judgment. 
While looking at the gaps which have objectively existed, we 
must not lose sight of our achievements in work. While 
understanding the subjective reasons contributing to the gaps, 
we must realize the constraints of the objective conditions. 
While seeing those unfavorable conditions, we must not lose 
sight of those favorable conditions to enhance our confidence 
and pluck up our courage. Let bygones be bygones. The 
latecomers can surpass the old-timers. It is no use feeling 
sorry about losing the previous good opportunities. What is 
important is that we must seize on new opportunities, give play 
to our strong points, take truly practical measures, rouse 
ourselves for vigorous efforts to make our province prosperous, 
and try hard to catch up. 
  Some comrades have the mentality of "not attempting to earn 
praise, but only working to avoid mistakes." They simply muddle 
along and refuse to make progress. This shows that they are 
devoid of lofty ambitions and great ideals. Communist party 
members are vanguard fighters of the working class, who have a 
communist consciousness. They must serve the people 
wholeheartedly. They must be the first to bear hardship, and 
the last to enjoy comforts. They must work selflessly for the 
common good of the people and make more contributions. In 
particular, our party cadres must diligently perform 
administrative work for the people, must set a good example, 
must struggle hard to do pioneering work, must explore the way 
forward to blaze new trails, and must truly make achievements. 
How can they "not attempt to earn praise, but only work to 
avoid mistakes?" Refusing to do administrative work diligently 
is also a type of corruption, albeit an invisible type of 
corruption. If a party member or party cadre fails to work hard 
to make contributions to the party, state and people, he is not 
a qualified party member or party cadre. He will harm the cause 
of the party and the people. It is precisely in this sense that 
we say: "Failing to earn praise means committing mistakes." 

    Besides, some comrades have the mentality of "being content 
with having enough clothes to wear and sufficient food to eat" 
and "being satisfied with small-scale prosperity." This has 
also shown that they are devoid of lofty ambitions and great 
ideals. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, we have made great achievements in reform, opening 
up, and socialist modernization, which have become the focus of 
world's attention. The living standards of our people have been 
significantly improved. On no account, however, can we be 
content with the existing achievements. The Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has set two goals. 
With regard to the goal of reform, we must initially establish 
a socialist market economic system by the end of this century. 
With regard to the goal of development, by the end of this 
century we will realize small-scale prosperity. In the middle 
of the next century, we will reach the level of the middle 
strata of developed nations. These two goals are great, 
glorious, and strenuous. We cannot attain them without lofty 
ambitions, great ideals, and persistent hard work. If we are 
content with the existing achievements of reform and 
development, this will really be too paltry. Even though we 
have succeeded in establishing the socialist market economic 
system, realizing small-scale prosperity, and reaching the level 
of the middle strata of the developed countries, we must not be 
content with them. We must never stop progressing. Fighting 
forever is our quality as communist party members as well as a 
duty we must fulfill in the course of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  To aim high and have lofty ambitions, we must study hard 
Marxism- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theories on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We 
must persist in using the viewpoints of dialectical materialism 
to observe and analyze problems to enhance our dedication to our 
cause as well as our sense of responsibility. This is the 
source of our strength for making explorations courageously and 
advancing incessantly. It is also the source of strength for 
building the socialist market economic system and pushing the 
great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics to victory.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon [19 February] the provincial 
government held a news briefing on the province's 1993 economic 
and social development. In 1993 the province maintained a good 
and speedy trend of economic development and made new 
breakthroughs in major economic indices, which manifested 
themselves in the following aspects: 
  First, the aggregate economic volume increased to a new 
level 
and the national economy developed rapidly. Last year, the 
province's gross domestic product topped 100 billion yuan, to 
stand at 114.6 billion yuan, an increase of 12.6 percent over 
the previous year and the province's highest record since the 
introduction of reform and opening up. The province reaped a 
good agricultural harvest in the course of structural 
adjustment, and maintained rapid industrial growth. The 
fixed-asset investment increased by a wide margin, and markets 
grew brisk amid stability. 
  Second, the province further improved its economic 
structure. 
This manifested itself in the structural change in primary, 
secondary, and tertiary industries. The rural production 
structure improved further. The investment structure was 
adjusted. 
  Third, the economy developed comparatively rapidly. Taking 
the province as a whole, tertiary industries developed rapidly, 
town and township enterprises developed even more rapidly, and 
the individual and private economic sectors made more 
contributions to the province's economy. 
  Fourth, there was good convergence between production and 
marketing, economic results improved, the economic order 
gradually returned to normal as a result of the implementation 
of state macroeconomic control and regulatory measures, and the 
economic environment improved markedly. 
  Fifth, the income of people in cities and towns increased. 
Last year their per capita income amounted to 2,443 yuan, while 
peasants' per capita net income amounted to 851 yuan. Allowing 
for price rises, the former increased by 10.1 percent over the 
previous year and the latter by 2 percent. 
  In 1993 the province registered good development in the 
national economy and in social undertakings, but there also were 
problems and drawbacks. For example, the shortage of funds for 
economic development still remained unresolved, commodity prices 
rose too rapidly, agricultural investment was inadequate, and 
social order needed further improvement. For this reason, the 
provincial government asked departments and governments at all 
levels to take positive and effective measures to bring about 
sustained, steady, and healthy development [chi xu wen ding jian 
kang fa zhan] in the province's national economy and social 
order.

  [Text] Changsha, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The drive for 
reform and opening-up over the past decade or so has boosted 
industry in this capital of central China's Hunan Province, 
according to reliable sources. 
  The average increase rate of Changsha's industrial 
production 
over the past 15 years of reform has hit 17.1 percent, one of 
the fastest rates of growth of any provincial capital in the 
country. 
  In order to make its industrial development stable and 
sound, 
the local government has divided the city's 145 industrial 
enterprises into four categories: rapid development, stable 
development, little development and serious predicament. 
  Apart from macro-control of industry, the local government 
has applied different policies and measures to the four 
categories of enterprises. 
  Priority has been given to the first two categories of 
well-run enterprises, which are usually big profit-earners, in 
allocation of funds, and supplies of electricity and 
transportation, to guarantee the production of popular products 
and exports. 
  For enterprises with the potential to eliminate losses and 
earn profits, on the one hand assistance has been provided to 
solve their problems in capital, transportation and marketing, 
and on the other pressure has been brought to bear on them to 
improve their management and operation mechanism. 
  The city government has also taken bold measures to foster 
the auctioning, annexing and leasing of enterprises in the red.

  [Text] A provincial meeting on building five economic 
zones and one economic corridor ended in Changsha yesterday [23 
February]. The meeting pointed out: The construction of these 
five economic zones and one economic corridor will play an 
important role in making Hunan rank among the country's top ten 
provinces. These five economic zones and one economic corridor 
will become the province's hi-tech industrial thoroughfare and 
export-oriented economic belt. Provincial party and government 
leaders Chen Bangzhu [governor], Chu Bo, Wang Keying, Tang 
Zhixiang, and Pan Guiyu attended the meeting and expressed high 
hopes for the five economic zones and one economic corridor. 
  In 1993, the cities where these five economic zones and one 
economic corridor are located followed the requirements set by 
the provincial party committee and government for making 
breakthroughs and moving forward ahead of others in economic 
construction. They made marked achievements in reform, opening 
up, and economic construction. Calculated on 1990 comparable 
prices, the five cities' GNP's amounted to 46 billion yuan, an 
increase of 14.2 percent over the previous year and 1.6 percent 
higher than the province's average. Their proportion to the 
province's GNP increased. 
  The meeting asked major departments directly under the 
provincial authorities to work out special plans to support the 
construction and development of the five economic zones and one 
economic corridor. The meeting explicitly demanded the 
following: The five economic zones and one economic corridor 
should directly transplant coastal areas' preferential policies 
on reform and opening up, as well as coastal areas' successful 
experience in this respect, and should apply them to large 
regions so they can turn themselves into a rapidly developing 
hi-tech industrial belt with strong functions and vitality. In 
accordance with the provincial leaders' requirements, the 
targets set for the five economic zones and one economic 
corridor leading up to the year 2000 will be divided into three 
parts: 1995, 1997, and 2000. 
  At the meeting, the relevant prefectures and cities made the 
development program for the five economic zones and one economic 
corridor more specific.

  [Text] Changsha, February 21 (XINHUA) -- A plan for the 
second phase construction of Hunan's Dongting Lake area 
anti-flood and flood storage project has passed state appraisal. 
  The appraisal group consisted of experts from the State 
Planning Commission, the state anti-flood headquarters and the 
Ministry of Water Conservancy. 
  The first phase construction started in 1986; the second is 
due to start this year and to be completed in 2000. 
  The Dongting Lake area, known as a natural granary, has been 
extended to create a center for major farm products in central 
China's Hunan Province. 
  The total farm production value of the area is over 50 
billion yuan (about 6 billion U.S. dollars) annually, one third 
of the Hunan Province total. 
  Dongting, one of the country's largest freshwater lakes, is 
a 
main channel and storage lake for floods from the Chang Jiang 
River and other rivers in Hunan. 
  The project is aimed to strengthen anti-flood capacity of 
the 
area and promote local economic development. 
  After eight years of the first phase construction of the 
project, the anti-flood capacity has been improved. 
  But because of long-time high water levels in the flood 
season, floods have left heavy layers of mud in the lake which 
have narrowed the flood channel and water areas of the lake. 
  The second phase construction will consist of seven 
projects, 
including consolidating and building the lake embankment higher, 
clearing the flood channels, flood storage facilities, and 
township anti-flood facilities and flood warning 
telecommunications system, as well as work on prevention of 
snail fever. 
  The second phase will cost nearly 6 billion yuan (about 700 
million U.S. dollars).

<F P=106> [Report: "Why Did Lin Wenqiang Hijack the Plane to Taiwan </F>
on 18 February?"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Today, 
this reporter interviewed a responsible official in the PRC 
Ministry of Public Security [MPS] about this year's first 
hijacking of a plane to Taiwan from the Chinese mainland on 18 
February, and was told that the hijacked Boeing 737/2599 
passenger plane, of China Southwest Airlines, was on Flight 4567 
from Guiyang to Changsha to Fuzhou. That day, the plane took off 
from Changsha at 0928 and flew over Fuzhou at about 1020. At 
that moment, hijacker Lin Wenqiang, carrying a fruit knife and 
an "explosive," forced the crew to open the door to the pilot's 
compartment, demanding that the plane fly to Taiwan. He 
threatened to stab the pilot to death with the knife and to blow 
up the plane if the pilot did not obey him. In order to 
guarantee the safety of the passengers and the plane, the crew 
accepted the hijacker's demand. Now, Lin has been detained by 
the Taiwan police. Lin's wife, stepmother, and two children 
have returned to the mainland on the same plane. 
  What kind of person is Lin Wenqiang? Why did he hijack a 
plane to Taiwan? The official answered this reporter's 
questions. According to the investigation by the mainland public 
security organs, hijacker Lin Wenqiang, male, was born on 2 June 
1958. He originally was a peasant in Huangshi Village, Baizhong 
Township, Minqing County, Fujian Province. In 1982, he managed 
the Wufengqiao ceramic tile factory, but the factory did not 
achieve good business results owing to poor management. He 
transferred the factory's management contract to other people in 
1992. At that time, he owed banks 7,470 yuan and owed the 
workers more than 70,000 yuan in wages. In July 1992, Lin went 
to Changsha, in Hunan, and undertook the management of the 
ceramic workshop at the Changsha fuse factory. As the quality 
and quantity of the workshop failed to meet standards, Lin's 
management contract was suspended by the factory in July 1993. 
Then, together with some people, Lin undertook the management of 
the household electrical appliance sales department of a labor 
service company. As Lin took away more than 2,200 yuan of sales 
income, the other partners stopped cooperating with him. These 
consecutive business failures made Lin unable to repay his 
increasing debts. He borrowed an armed police officer's uniform 
from an officer's wife on the pretext of taking photos for fun. 
He then used forged certificates and passed himself off as an 
armed police officer in order to board the plane he planned to 
hijack. 
  The official stressed: The frequent occurrence of hijacking 
incidents between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits is not 
accidental. This is related directly to the Taiwan authorities' 
policy for handling such criminal cases. Although the Taiwan 
authorities take certain legal actions against hijackers, the 
punishments are too lenient for such a serious crime, and the 
hijackers are not sent back to the mainland. Although the 
Taiwan authorities take certain legal actions against hijackers, 
the punishments are too lenient for such a serious crime, and 
the hijackers are not sent back to the mainland. This has 
abetted some lawless people in making the desperate move. Facts 
demonstrate that if the hijackers are not sent back, there will 
be no peace in the air above the straits. It is hoped that the 
Taiwan authorities will consider the safety of civil aviation 
and of passengers' property, and will assume a realistic 
attitude to promoting the conclusion of an agreement on 
returning hijackers between the two sides of the straits, thus 
thoroughly eliminating the crime of hijacking.

  [Text] Taiyuan, February 22 (XINHUA) -- The economic and 
cultural ties between north China's Shanxi Province and Taiwan 
are getting closer and closer, province officials here said. 
  Among the 28 countries and regions that have invested in 
this 
inland province, the officials said, Taiwan now ranks second 
after Hong Kong in the number of cooperation projects and the 
volume of investment. 
  Taiwan businesses signed 132 cooperation projects with the 
province in 1993, promising to invest as much as 356 million 
U.S. dollars, the officials said. 
  That made the province's Taiwan-funded projects jump to 248, 
and the volume of contracted Taiwan investment to 391 million 
U.S. dollars, the officials noted. 
  Since the province's first Taiwan-funded project started in 
1989, Taiwan businesses have been set up in ten of its major 
cities. 
  The officials believe that Shanxi's rich resources of coal 
and iron, its cheap labor and large market are just what Taiwan 
investors are looking for. 
  They said Shanxi's investment environment is improving 
rapidly. The airport in this provincial capital is under 
expansion, regular flights have started between Taiyuan and Hong 
Kong, and the telecommunication networks of many cities have 
been updated. 
  What is more, the officials said, the interests of Taiwan 
investors are guaranteed by preferential investment policies and 
all-round investment services. 
  So far, 70 percent of the Taiwan-funded businesses are in 
the 
field of manufacturing, including coal processing, textiles, 
metallurgy, machinery, electronics and foodstuffs. 
  While Taiwan investors tended to choose small and 
medium-sized enterprises as their partners in the beginning, the 
officials said, more and more of them are now turning to large 
state enterprises. 
  Besides the manufacturing sector, Taiwan investors 
established new businesses in Shanxi in 1993 -- in a hot springs 
resort, a luxury hotel and real estate. 
  Last year trade between Taiwan and Shanxi was valued at 
29.861 million U.S. dollars. The inland province exported coal, 
pig iron, cast iron, toys and agricultural products and imported 
raw chemicals, steel and machinery. 
  However, the officials said they believed that the biggest 
breakthrough in the relations between the two sides in 1993 was 
in personnel exchanges. For the first time in several decades, 
altogether 155 persons from Shanxi visited the island province. 
  Among the 155 was an official delegation headed by 
provincial 
Director of the Coal Industry Wu Sansong and a folk dance troupe. 
  On the other hand, visitors from Taiwan continue to come in 
ever-increasing numbers. Among the nearly 2,000 Taiwan visitors 
in 1993 was a delegation from the Association for the Promotion 
of Mining and a 48-member group from the Chinese Drama Society. 
  Cooperation between the two sides has also been expanded to 
publishing, the cinema, sports and many other fields, the 
officials added.

<F P=106> [Report by Huang Mei-ping; from the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] Bilateral talks between the ROC [Republic of China] 
and the United States on the former's admission to GATT have 
begun. According to the U.S. assistant trade representative who 
serves as the chief U.S. negotiator, the task force on our 
country's admission to GATT will soon enter the stage of 
substantive discussions. The United States is willing to 
coordinate its actions and assist our country in joining GATT, 
and in becoming a member of other world trade bodies. It is 
hoped that during the current talks, the two sides will make 
substantial progress in reducing tariffs and in opening up the 
agricultural and service markets. Speaking after the talks, 
Vice Economic Minister Hsu K'e-sheng, who is our chief 
negotiator, said: Of the more than 2,700 products in which the 
United States expressed an interest, our side promised to adjust 
the tariff rates for 253 farm products and 2,093 industrial 
goods, but the U.S. side was not satisfied. It also did not 
accept our country's request that talks on initial negotiation 
rights be held only after the conclusion of talks on tariffs and 
the finalization of the tariff reduction scheme. The two sides 
decided to hold more discussions on tariff reductions on 26 
February. The U.S. side, however, accepted our request that 
tariff reductions in preparation for our admission to GATT be 
introduced in a single move so that the cow would not be skinned 
twice. He said: 
  [Begin recording Hsu K'e-sheng] Other than the 2,700 tariff 
items that are of interest to them, we did not respond to their 
demands that we set the overall level of our tariff rates and 
specify the goods to which the U.S. side can claim initial 
negotiation rights. The U.S. side thought this would make 
piecemeal discussions with us impossible. [end recording] 
  During the talks, our side also said: After joining GATT, 
our country agrees to import food grains and to allow the 
gradual import of some farm products based on tariffication and 
tariff quotas in accordance with the results of the Uruguay 
Round of trade talks. The U.S. side, however, emphasized that 
tariffcation measures are inappropriate for our country, which 
is not currently a GATT member. As for the opening of the rice 
market, our side expressed the hope that it be allowed to adopt 
the South Korean model, but the U.S. side did not offer an 
immediate response. According to the agenda for the second day 
of talks, the two sides will continue discussions on opening up 
the service market and on our country's participation in signing 
the Tokyo Round agreements.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan will not make any 
promises regarding US concerns over the opening of Taiwan's 
service industry, Taipei's top negotiator said Friday [25 
February]. 
  Vice Economics Minister Sheu Ke-sheng [Hsu K'e-sheng] made 
the statement on the second day of US-Taiwan trade negotiations 
called to discuss Taiwan's bid for full membership in the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  On the first day of talks Thursday, the US expressed its 
dissatisfaction with Taiwan's proposed tariff reductions, saying 
they were far short of US expectations. 
  The US said Taiwan did not make a "complete" response to its 
Nov. 24, 1993 request that Taiwan lower tariffs on more than 
8,000 farm and industrial products. 
  Taipei Thursday submitted a list of 253 farm and 2,097 
industrial products pegged for tariff cuts. 
  During the talks, the US also asked how Taiwan would handle 
its existing restrictions on the import of agricultural products 
after its admission to GATT. 
  Taiwan delegates said Taiwan hoped to follow the example set 
by South Korea and gradually open its market to foreign 
agricultural products. 
  On the US concerns over Taiwan's export subsidies, 
inspection 
systems and quarantine, the Taipei delegates said Taiwan has 
never subsidized its farm exports and its inspection and 
quarantine practices are all in line with GATT standards. 
  Meanwhile, a Finance Ministry official noted that the US had 
not set any specific agenda for Friday's negotiations on 
financial and service industry issues. 
  He said this was because Taiwan had opened its financial 
market wider than any other Southeast Asian country.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA) -- A forty year old 
monopoly tax on imported alcohol and tobacco will be lifted by 
June 1995, a financial official said Thursday [24 February]. 
  Lin Chien-hsiung, director of the Department of National 
Treasury, made the announcement on the opening day of US-Taiwan 
tariff reduction negotiations. 
  US negotiators had earlier requested Taiwan revoke its 
monopoly alcohol and tobacco tax in accord with General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) regulations. 
  Taiwan currently imposes monopoly taxes on the imported 
products averaging NT$16.6 (US$0.61) per pack of cigarettes and 
NT$660 (us$24.4) per liter of alcohol. 
  After the monopoly tax is lifted, imported alcohol and 
tobacco will be subject to normal taxes, Lin said.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- The European Union (EU) 
supports Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) and hopes to see a GATT membership for Taiwan 
before the end of this year, an EU official said Thursday [24 
February]. 
  Hugo Paemen, a ranking EU official in charge of external 
economic relations, said the EU may also consider establishing a 
representative office in Taiwan after Taiwan becomes a GATT 
member. 
  Paemen made the remarks after leading a 21-member EU 
delegation to two days of trade consultations with an 18-member 
Republic of China [ROC] delegation at EU headquarters. It was 
the first such meeting between European Union and ROC officials. 
  Paemen said the consultations were generally satisfactory 
and 
progress was made on several issues including market opening. 
  The EU official commented that even though the EU has 
maintained a low profile when working with Taiwan, it is willing 
to establish a formal communication channel. "And that's why 
this consultation was arranged here in the EU headquarters," he 
said. 
  The ROC delegation, headed by Board of Foreign Trade 
Director-General Huang Yen-chao, said it was agreed that Taiwan 
will sign an agreement on hazardous waste transportation with 
the EU before May 6. 
  During the meeting, the ROC negotiators also explained 
Taiwan's strenuous efforts in wildlife conservation. They asked 
the EU to help provide details of accusations by world 
conservation groups that Taiwan allows trade in endangered 
species products to help Taiwan authorities in future crackdowns. 
  As to scientific and technological cooperation, the EU 
officials said the union has at present no plan to set up an EU 
sci-tech center in Taiwan. However, it welcomes bilateral 
sci-tech personnel exchanges and EU [as received] and looks 
forward to detailed discussions on this concern. 
  The two sides also talked about Taiwan opening up its 
insurance, stock and securities markets and improvement in 
Taiwan's tariff system on imported tobacco and alcohol. 
  The next ROC-EU trade consultation will be held in Taipei, 
they decided.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- Taiwan is likely to sign a 
special financial exchange agreement with the United States on 
Saturday [26 February] independent of any agreements the two 
reach here concerning Taiwan tariff reductions. 
  Central Bank of China officials said that it's necessary for 
Taiwan to ink such agreements with contracting parties of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, to pave the way 
for Taiwan's admission into the world body. 
  They said that the proposed ROC [Republic of China]-U.S. 
agreement will follow rules set by the International Monetary 
Fund, which requires members to avoid payment restrictions on 
current account trade and discriminative currency practices, to 
provide exchange information, to allow the exchange of national 
currency held in foreign countries, and to hold consultations 
with other contracting parties on existing international pacts. 
  Peng Fai-nan, general manager of the Central Bank's foreign 
exchange department, will sign the agreement with the United 
States on behalf of Taiwan. 
  Central bank officials said that Peng and U.S. negotiators 
will not discuss the U.S. request that Taiwan further ease 
restrictions on the flow of foreign capital, although they said 
future negotiations on the issue are possible.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- An investment guarantee 
law proposed recently by Beijing's State Council is only a ploy 
as part of Mainland China's effort to achieve its goal of "one 
China, two systems," Mainland Affairs Council Chairman [MAC] 
Huang Kun-hui said Thursday [24 February]. 
  Huang, at a Legislative Yuan briefing session, reported that 
although the protection law, made public at the end of last year 
by Mainland China's State Council, seems to have upgraded the 
status of Taiwan businessmen on the mainland, it does not 
include concrete measures to protect Taiwan investors' business 
interests and personal rights. 
  The newly issued investment protection law still considers 
Taiwan investors "special local investors" subject to Mainland 
China's relevant laws and regulations, Huang said. 
  Huang appealed to local industries to act with utmost 
caution 
in the face of any possible policy changes that might cause 
great losses to them, given that Mainland China is undergoing an 
economic transformation from a planned economy to a 
market-oriented one. 
  Mainland China so far lacks a comprehensive law regulating 
Taiwan industries' investment and normal business practices 
there, let alone protecting their property rights and lives, 
Huang said. In other countries, he added, foreign investors are 
usually given special protection. 
  Taiwan investors can be fully protected in Mainland China 
only when a formal and wide-ranging investment guarantee 
agreement is worked out by Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation 
[SEF] and Beijing's Association of Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait [ARATS], he said. 
  The SEF and ARATS are the semi-official agents representing 
Taiwan and Mainland China in cross-strait affairs in the absence 
of formal contacts between Taipei and Beijing.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui on 
Thursday [24 February] pledged to do everything in his power to 
heal the national wounds caused by the Feb. 28, 1947 killing of 
Taiwan civilians by government troops. 
  "I fully understand that to heal the wounds is a very 
difficult task, but I will do my best," Li said while meeting a 
group of families whose relatives were killed during the 
incident. 
  It is still unknown how many people were killed in the 
incident, which Li said was triggered by a misunderstanding 
between native Taiwanese and Chinese who had fled communist rule. 
  According to an estimate by an ad hoc committee formed by 
the 
Executive Yuan to deal with fallout from the incident, between 
18,000 to 28,000 people -- mostly Taiwanese -- were killed. 
  Li said the incident was indeed a "tragedy" that he 
regretted. But he stressed that the government has been active 
in recent years in trying to soothe the spirits of the deceased 
and compensate their families, pointing to the building of a 
monument commemorating the victims and the appointment of a 
special task force to handle related affairs. 
  Li promised to lead a memorial service when the monument is 
completed next year. 
  Prof. Lin Tsung-yi, who represents families of the victims 
on 
the Executive Yuan's special committee, gave a positive 
appraisal of what the government has done to assuage the 
families, and thanked Li for the concern he has shown. 
  Li also guaranteed that he would push for passage of a bill 
regarding compensation to the victims' families. The bill had 
passed a first reading at the legislature, but was shelved when 
the families demanded more money. 
  Many of those in attendance at the meeting [words 
indistinct] 
sobbed when recalling events of the historic day.

  [Text] Madrid, Feb. 22 (CNA) -- Taiwan exports to European 
Union [EU] countries, except Ireland, declined noticeably in 
1993, statistics released by the EU show. 
  Germany was Taiwan's biggest export market in Europe last 
year, taking in U.S.$3.5 billion of Taiwan goods, a 2.6 percent 
decline from 1992. 
  England took second place by absorbing U.S.$2.16 billion 
worth of Taiwan products and services last year, a drop of 1.8 
percent from the previous year. 
  Ranking third was the Netherlands, which posted a slight 
0.03 
decrease in importing U.S.$2.11 billon of Taiwan products and 
services. 
  Taiwan exports to France and Italy also declined by 13.9 
percent and 20.4 percent to U.S.$1.07 billion and U.S.$767 
million, respectively, according to the statistics. 
  Exports to Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Luxembourg last year 
all slid more then 30 percent from 1992 to U.S.$553 million, 
U.S.$125 million, U.S.$99 million and U.S.$5.3 million, 
respectively, while exports to Belgium and Denmark fell 3.1 
percent and 15 percent to U.S.$55 million and U.S.$155 million. 
  Exports to Ireland, meanwhile, climbed by 26.2 percent.

<F P=106> [Question and answer session with Governor Christopher </F>
Patten and members of the Legislative Council at the Legislative 
Council Chamber in Hong Kong--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Andrew Wong, in Cantonese with simultaneous 
translation into English] Mr. President, although yesterday I 
voted against the motion moved by Mrs. Elsie Tu to delay our 
consideration of the first part of the electoral arrangements 
bill, it does not mean that I do not agree with the rationale 
behind her move. I firmly believe that both China and Britain 
should be sincere and open to reach an agreement through talks. 
For this reasons, I hope that you, Mr. Governor, can respond to 
several questions first, which perhaps have been answered in 
your statement; that is: Are the Britain and Hong Kong side 
still willing to talk with the Chinese side? [passage omitted] 
If the Legislative Council and the future legislature can have 
most seats returned through elections and abide by the principle 
of being fair and open, then can you not consider adopting a 
proportional representation [PR] voting system? Thank you. 
  [Governor Patten] The honorable member raised a number of 
issues. Some of them are a little complicated. But let me try 
to respond as clearly as possible. First, on willingness to 
talk. In, I hope, as factual and unprovocative a way as 
possible, let me remind the council that we proposed talks in 
October 1992, that we went on saying that we wanted to talk for 
the next six or seven months while we were not, frankly, getting 
a very warm response from Chinese officials. We were pleased 
when talks eventually got underway in April 1993, only sorry 
that they had taken so long to get underway. We would have liked 
to go on talking even after time had pressed us to put in the 
second of the three bills which the Legislative Council is going 
to have to consider. But, alas, Chinese officials insisted that 
we withdraw the second bill, the partial legislation that was 
passed yesterday, before they were prepared to come to the 
table. Our door is never closed, and we want to talk on a whole 
range of issues and talk constructively and creatively. We 
would like to see more constructive and creative talks in the 
Joint Liaison Group. We would like to see an early meeting of 
the Airport Committee to resolve an issue, which I think the 
whole community thinks has dragged on too long. So, as far as 
we are concerned, cooperation remains something on which we are 
particularly keen. But, I do have to point out that we had 17 
rounds of talks, and I think when honorable members, including 
the distinguished honorable member who has just spoken, see the 
account of those 17 rounds of talks in the White Paper, they 
will be surprised how much time was spent discussing so little 
agreement. [passage omitted] 
  This council has voted pretty decisively now on at least a 
couple of occasions on the question of the voting method for 
geographical constituencies, and I think the arguments for 
proportionality, if I may say so, are somewhat lessened when you 
would seek to achieve proportionality, or you seek to achieve 
balance by having three different sorts of electoral process. 
If every member of this Legislative Council was to be elected 
directly -- as some honorable members would like, as I am sure 
some honorable members will press for during the debates that 
lie ahead -- if every member was directly elected, then I think 
the argument for a proportional voting system would be that much 
stronger. But since we had tried to achieved balance through 
the functional constituencies, through the election committee, I 
think the arguments for PR are much less considerable. And so, 
I notice, does the Legislative Council. If the honorable member 
was able with his powers of eloquence to persuade his colleagues 
differently, then it would require, of course, overturning 
several votes which the Legislative Council has already taken. 
I hope I have responded in some detail to the honorable 
member's question. 
  [Ha Wing-ho, in Cantonese with simultaneous translation into 
English] Mr. Governor, after the release of the White Paper, if 
we read the White Paper and feel that the British side should 
score a higher mark, it does not help us to solve the question; 
that is, in 1995, there may be a new Legislative Council, but by 
1997, all the Legislative Councillors returned in 1995 may have 
to climb down the tree. Mr. Governor, can you solve this 
problem for us? 
  [Patten] I cannot solve unilaterally the question of how we 
secure a through train. I think that the council will see from 
the White Paper that unfortunately we were not able to secure 
Chinese agreement to a through train during 17 rounds of talks, 
though we tried, I think imaginatively and sensibly to do so, 
with the proposals we put about oaths and about other matters. 
But let me just deal briefly with the question of what happens 
in 1997. I choose my words carefully, they do not in any way 
reflect on Chinese sovereignty, they do not in any way change 
the historic fact of 30 June and 1 July 1997, but I do not 
believe there is any reason -- I stress that word -- I do not 
believe there is any reason why China should seek to overturn 
arrangements in 1997 which are entirely in compliance with the 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. The assertion that they 
are not has been made on a number of occasions, but the 
assertion has been made more frequently than any evidence has 
ever been adduced. It goes on being said, but nobody ever 
demonstrates how it happens to be the case. And I say one other 
thing as well, using, since I noticed that metaphors were from 
the beginning of the debate yesterday in much evidence in the 
chamber, using a metaphor to make the point: If my next-door 
neighbor says that in three and a half years he is going to come 
round to my house and break all the windows, that does not seem 
to me to be a very persuasive argument for me breaking all the 
windows this afternoon. 
  [Mrs. Elsie Tu] Thank you, Mr. President. Mr President, 
may I ask the governor, through you, something that has been 
puzzling me for a long time. The proposed political package is 
always referred to as being democratic. Can the governor 
explain to me how it is democratic to give two votes to every 
person who works in a workplace, but only one person, one vote 
to those who work in other places, such as housewives, or 
elderly persons retired, and adult students? I find it very 
difficult to understand how it is democratic. It means that the 
ones who are not working in a workplace are only half a person. 
  [Patten] Well, I am sure the honorable lady, whose vigorous 
eloquence I salute as the Legislative Council has, I am sure 
that the honorable lady would not want me to take that argument 
to its conclusion, because the conclusion of the argument is 
that the proposals that are being put forward in the bill that 
will be published tomorrow are a great deal more democratic than 
the present system. Under the present system -- and perhaps the 
honorable lady wishes to argue the case against functional 
constituencies, perhaps that is her argument -- under the 
present system, only a few people have two votes because of 
functional constituencies and geographical constituencies. Of 
course, some have a lot more than two votes. Some, because of 
corporate voting in constituencies have -- oh -- votes into 
double figure, and that is a situation that we are anxious to 
eliminate with the introduction of individual rather than 
corporate voting. It is perfectly true that because not 
everyone is at work the extension of votes as we have proposed 
in the nine new functional constituencies does not mean that 
everyone in the community has two votes, but that is because of 
the nature of functional constituencies, and I would not want to 
challenge the Basic Law in having the number of functional 
constituencies of 30, which are proposed for 1995 through to 
1999. [passage omitted] 
  [Elsie Tu] I think the present system is quite right, the 
present system does give two votes to some people, and I 
disagree with that. I think people should have a choice, but to 
make it work does not seem any more democratic. Is it not less 
democratic to give more people two votes? 
  [Patten] I think it is an argument which few would accept 
that extending the ability to vote is less democratic than 
limiting the ability to vote. I really cannot follow the 
argument that by ensuring more people are able to vote in 
functional constituencies, one is going down a less democratic 
path. That seems to me to be a considerable contradiction in 
terms, but if the honorable lady is arguing the case in 
principle against functional constituencies, which she may well 
be, all I can say is that we are committed to trying to 
introduce arrangements which are in compliance with the Basic 
Law, and the Basic Law proposes 30 functional constituencies. 
The question is whether those functional constituencies, for 
example, in line with the 1988 White Paper, represent economic 
and professional sectors of substantial importance, and the 
question, secondly, is whether, following I think it is Basic 
Law 68, pursuing matters in an orderly way, whether we try to 
deal with some of the real problems which have arisen in 
functional constituencies in the last few years. Honorable 
members are well aware of some of the problems that have arisen 
in those functional constituencies. They may disagree with the 
proposals that we have brought forward in trying to deal with 
them, in which case they will be able to debate this in this 
Legislative Council. It is very, very difficult to devise nine 
new functional constituencies, and I think that some of the 
inherent difficulties will be demonstrated to all those 
honorable members who read the White Paper and the account of 
our negotiations with our Chinese colleagues on this point. 
  [Reverend Fung Chi-woo, in Cantonese with simultaneous 
translation into English] [Passage omitted] Will the governor 
lobby the councillors to accept your proposals to make sure they 
will go through smoothly. What will you do? 
  [Patten] We will do what we did in the run-up to yesterday's 
debate. Argue our case with all that gentle eloquence for which 
members of the Hong Kong government are renowned. We do not 
have any of the instruments which are perhaps available 
elsewhere in other communities. We recognize that this council 
has to make decisions, and that this council has 60 
independent-minded members who are not going to be pushed around 
by a government, and I hope are not going to be pushed around by 
anybody else in Hong Kong or outside Hong Kong. So we will 
argue our case, but if by lobbying you mean making threats, if 
by lobbying the honorable member means seeking, of course 
metaphorically, to break arms and legs, that is not our way. We 
put these proposals forward in good faith. We will argue the 
case for them and hope that they provide an acceptable basis for 
the electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. I have to say if I 
look back to yesterday, we were told at the beginning of the 
week that we would just scrape through with our bill yesterday. 
Well it proved to be, I am pleased to say, rather better than 
that. And I would like to add one point about it. I think it 
was an extremely important day for Hong Kong. I think it was an 
extremely important mature moment in Hong Kong's history. 
Nobody can wipe it out. Nobody can pretend it did not happen. 
Nobody can turn the clock back on what happened. Not just the 
particular decisions about electoral arrangements that were 
made, but the whole process: what was actually happening in this 
chamber. And happening with considerable maturity, with of 
course, a lot of polite vigor, but happening I am sure in the 
case of every honorable member, happening in a way in which 
honorable members hoped would secure the best interests of the 
people of Hong Kong. And it is entirely right that this 
Legislative Council should be involved in the process in the way 
it was yesterday. 
  [Mr. Howard Young] Mr. Governor, the gazetting and tabling 
of the 1992 version of the second-stage reforms is, as you 
described, without an agreement with China. However, on the 
other hand, British Government says that it is willing to 
continue negotiations. Although slim as they are the chances of 
such happening, has it gone beyond the stage yet where, during 
the legislative process, should there be agreement reached in 
one form or another with China -- not necessarily in 
negotiations, agreements can even be reached by diplomatic 
letters of exchange -- if during that process has it gone beyond 
the stage where the government might even bring up amendments to 
what is being gazetted tomorrow to conform with any such 
agreement that could be reached before the legislative process 
has ended? 
  [Patten] I repeat, in a way, what I said earlier, that our 
door has never been closed, and will never be closed. And if, 
in the course of the next few months, we thought there was the 
chance of an agreed way forward with China, which was also 
acceptable and which secured the objectives which I think the 
community has, then we would of course have to present that to 
the council, even if it meant amending what was already being 
considered by the council. That is, I hope, an earnest of our 
sincerity. But again, I say, time does close in. It is not 
because we wish it were that way, it is part of the ineluctable 
movement of the calendar, and the elections that we have got, 
are, for reasons which the whole council knows are extremely 
complicated, and do involve complicated arrangements. But I 
repeat, it has never been our position that we declined to have 
talks. 
  [Christine Loh] Thank you, Mr. President. I welcome the 
release of the 17 rounds of talks by both the British and the 
Chinese Government. It will at least give the people of Hong 
Kong a change to protest against compromises made in their name. 
What I would like to ask is: Traditionally, the British 
Government's position has always been that these are diplomatic 
issues and they should be kept confidential, but now that since 
both governments are going to release the information, is that 
not really now a signal of the end of Sino-British negotiations 
over electoral reform. And also my second question is: If we 
were to pass these legislations -- and I certainly hope that we 
will pass them before July -- there is no opportunity really to 
ever return to discuss these issues with China, is that correct? 
  [Patten] Well, it is perfectly correct that we would not 
have taken this step, which as the honorable member says has 
already been taken by, in a way, by Chinese officials, if we 
thought there was a rosy prospect of keeping negotiations going. 
But I am an experienced enough politician never to say never. 
There may be a prospect down the road of reviving some sort of, 
within time, some sort of dialogue on electoral matters. The 
whole community, I am sure, hopes that's possible. At the same 
time, my reading of the community is that they would like to get 
this debate over and done with and out of the way, and get on 
with other matters. [passage omitted] 
  [Jimmy McGregor] Governor, it is my impression that the two 
proposals yet to come before us in the form of legislation are 
the two critical proposals in your packages of seven or eight 
proposals, which you started with. It is also my impression 
that one of these proposals may undergo very considerable change 
in discussion in this council. If that proves to be the case, 
and remembering that the British Government has already 
compromised both of these proposals to some extent by entering 
into negotiations and modifying the proposals to become somewhat 
less democratic as far as we can make out, will you be able to 
accept, in good faith, the modification of at least one of these 
two major proposals, and the possible modification of the other 
to some extent, and accept that in good faith this council would 
reach that conclusion and that you will be able to bring 
legislation in to give effect to these changes which, this 
council in its wisdom, requests? 
  [Patten] [Passage omitted] We are not simply going to come 
down to the Legislative Council, put the bill on the table, and 
then scarper. That is not our intention, and it would not be 
honorable to behave in that way. But the Legislative Council 
has an important function. The Legislative Council has to 
consider legislation, and if necessary, the Legislative Council 
has the power to amend legislation. That is true today, and it 
will be true, according to the Basic Law, after 1997. So, if 
the Legislative Council changed the proposals which are put to 
them, then at the end of the day that is a reality which we have 
to accept. I would just add this one point. That I would be 
put in a difficult position, the government would be put in a 
difficult position, the British Government would be put in a 
difficult position, if the Legislative Council appeared to have 
agreed with arrangements which were not fair and which were not 
open and which did not seem to be acceptable to the community. 
But I don't think that is a remotely likely possibility, since I 
think the community's views are extremely well-represented in 
this council. Though, in good faith, if the Legislative Council 
changed the proposals, the government would accept them. 
  [Martin Barrow] Governor, you mentioned earlier other 
issues on the agenda for discussion with China. Could you 
comment on the government's strategy for discussing economic 
issues, such as the airport? 
  [Patten] Yes. Our strategy is to press as courteously and 
constructively for a dialogue on these matters as possible. 
There are discussions going on this week, as I think the 
council knows on the difficult but important issue of the future 
of defense lands. That has an economic aspect as well as other 
aspects as well. We would like to have the opportunity of 
discussing with Chinese officials, sooner rather than later, the 
proposals that we have put, the fourth set of proposals that we 
have put, on financing the airport. There are a lot of other 
proposals touching on Hong Kong's economic well being that we 
would like to carry forward. I was encouraged by what the 
Chinese prime minister said last December about Chinese 
officials being determined not to let any political argument 
affect the livelihood of Hong Kong and to continue to work for 
the interests of Hong Kong. So I hope that we can see a 
dialogue develop rather more constructively than perhaps as 
happened not just for the last 18 months, but for the last three 
years. In the meantime, we continue with the support from time 
to time, when expenditure decisions are necessary, we continue 
to do what we believe is in the long-term interests of Hong 
Kong. That has been, so far I am pleased to say, a beneficial 
process. And the latest round of those benefits will be made 
public when the financial secretary announces his budget next 
week. 
  [Emily Lau] I want to ask the Governor a question about 
electoral arrangements which may be in breach of the Basic Law, 
because earlier this afternoon he kept talking about putting in 
place arrangements which are in line with the Basic Law. But of 
course, when we saw the foreign secretary last year, he said the 
importance is that they are in line with Britain's international 
obligations. As the Governor rightly pointed out just then, 
certain people, including myself, will be moving an amendment 
for 60 seats in the council to be directly elected in 1995, and 
that I guess the governor would say, is not in line with the 
provisions of the Basic Law. Mr. President, I want to ask the 
governor, what will he and the British Government do then? If 
it is blatantly in breach of the Basic Law, will the British 
administration move to block it or will you still say that it is 
line with the Joint Declaration, also in line with Britain's 
international obligations, so you would support it. Thank you. 
  [Patten] Well, I am of course an unqualified and unabashed 
admirer of the honorable lady's political and rhetorical 
talents. But I think I would like to see her majority before I 
answer the question. I know that the honorable lady has an 
unshakable and wholly honorable commitment to a totally 
democratic system in Hong Kong well before 2007, and preferably 
next week. I respect the honorable lady's courage in arguing 
for that and consistency in arguing for that. But I do not 
honestly think that the honorable lady is going to be.... 
[changes thought] she may prove me wrong, she has proved British 
politicians wrong on occasions in the past and asked difficult 
questions of British politicians. I do not think the honorable 
lady is likely to secure the outcome in the next few months 
which she understandably and honorably has said. If she does, I 
will answer the question. 
  [Emily Lau] The governor has not answered my question. My 
question is whether he will block it? If he blocks it, then it 
cannot even be introduced. If it is given a chance, maybe it 
will be defeated by my colleagues, maybe it will be carried. If 
it is not even allowed to be introduced, how can I prove to you? 
  [Patten] Nobody, I will keep my decibel count down, nobody 
is actually saying the honorable lady cannot introduce her 
argument and her ideas. It would be an extremely brave woman, 
an even braver man, who ever tried to stop the honorable lady 
developing a political argument. The political argument she has 
got is one which many people in this community and outside the 
community would regard as wholly reasonable. But I do not think 
that it is ever sensible to answer very hypothetical questions 
in the way that the honorable lady is inviting me to. I answer 
sometimes partially hypothetical questions, but the more 
hypothetical they are, the less sensible I think it is to answer 
them. And just to add one point, I think that it is a strength 
of our proposals, the government's proposals, that they are not 
only in line with the Joint Declaration but also wholly in line 
with the Basic Law. And I think that it is a matter of strength 
as well, that despite the rain forests that have been cut down 
over the last year and a half to try to demonstrate that we have 
violated the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration, no evidence 
which convinces anybody has ever been adduced for that. I do 
not think that we would be in a stronger position if we had put 
forward proposals such as the honorable lady advances, which go 
against the Basic Law. What we are trying to do is build as 
broad a base of support in the community as possible. But 
somebody with my background could not help but admire the 
objectives which the honorable lady has set herself and for 
which she has argued with, as I said, such consistency and 
passion often to the embarrassment of politicians from Britain 
and elsewhere.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chen Yonghong (7115 3057 4767) and trainee Fan </F>
Zhigeng (2868 1807 5087)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- At a news conference 
this afternoon, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang 
commented on the adoption by the Hong Kong Legislative Council 
[Legco] of the partial "electoral bill" submitted by Chris 
Patten and the unilateral decision by the British to make public 
the contents of the Sino-British talks. He said: The door to 
negotiation has been closed by the British. Responsibility for 
the disruption of cooperation between China and Britain on Hong 
Kong's political system rests entirely on the British. 
  A reporter asked: On 24 February, Legco passed the 
first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election 
arrangements. The Hong Kong Government will next submit the 
second-phase draft legislation to Legco for discussion. What 
are your comments? 
  Shen Guofang said: Last December, before the Chinese and the 
British had reached any agreement on district board election 
arrangements, the British side submitted the first-phase draft 
of legislation to the Hong Kong Legislative Council, thus 
directly causing the termination of the talks between China and 
Britain. Now, disregarding repeated dissuasion by China, and the 
aspirations of every social level in Hong Kong for a settlement 
of the question of the 1994-1995 election arrangements through 
negotiation, the British side has had the first-phase draft 
legislation on the 1994- 95 election arrangements passed by the 
Hong Kong Legco and has decided to submit the second-phase draft 
legislation to Legco for discussion. This fully shows that the 
British do not have the sincerity to solve the question through 
cooperation with the Chinese, and are bent on moving further on 
this erroneous path. 
  Shen Guofang said: "The door to negotiation has been closed 
by the British. Responsibility for the disruption of 
cooperation between China and Britain on Hong Kong's political 
system rests entirely with the British. The Chinese side 
reiterates that, without an agreement between China and Britain, 
the framework of the three-tiered political system established 
through British Hong Kong authorities, legislation cannot last 
beyond 30 June 1997." 
  Another reporter asked: The British side today published a 
white paper which discloses the detailed contents of last year's 
Sino- British talks. What are your comments on this? 
  Shen Guofang said: An understanding not to disclose to the 
public the contents of the negotiations was reached between 
China and Britain before the talks began last year. Britain's 
unilateral publication of the contents constitutes a violation 
of the understanding reached between the two sides. The Chinese 
cannot but react in due course. 
  Asked about the comments of Australian Foreign Minister 
Evans 
who, in a recent television interview in Australia, expressed 
strong support for Chris Patten's political package, Shen 
Guofang said the current issue between China and Britain on Hong 
Kong was not whether the territory should have democracy, but 
whether a commitment was to be honored. There had been a series 
of agreements and understandings between the two countries on 
the evolution of Hong Kong's political system. But the British 
were now trying to repudiate them and have their own way. This 
was absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese. 
  He said: In the more than one hundred years of British rule 
there has been no democracy at all in Hong Kong. It is with 
ulterior motives that Britain is pushing Chris Patten's package 
in Hong Kong before it leaves. It is futile to defend the 
package. 
  Shen Guofang emphasized: The maintenance of Hong Kong's 
social stability and economic prosperity is not only in the 
interests of China and Britain, but also of those countries that 
have economic interests in Hong Kong. The question of Hong Kong 
is a matter between China and Britain before 30 June 1997, and 
from 1 July 1997, it will be purely an internal affair of China. 
It is inappropriate to make irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong 
political affairs.

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Some Hong Kong 
legislators have lashed out at Governor Chris Patten for 
sabotaging the Sino-British talks and felt uneasy about the 
adoption of the partial reform bill at the Legislative Council 
earlier this morning. 
  Veteran legislator Elsie Tu, who had tabled a motion to 
delay 
the partial reform bill in the hope that the Sino-British talks 
might resume, said that the adoption of the bill means a total 
breakdown of the Sino-British talks. 
  If the Sino-British talks remain stalled, Tu said, the years 
between now and 1997 will not be smooth for Hong Kong, because 
in a broken family there is inevitably a breakdown in 
communication and a lack of co-operation. 
  "And in a broken family it is the innocent children who 
suffer most. The innocent children in this case are the 
ordinary people of Hong Kong, the silent majority, who seek 
nothing more than to get on with their lives," she added. 
  Tu's adjourn motion was supported by 23 other legislators, 
who described Tu as "courageous," "responsible," "incurably 
optimistic" and with a "whole-hearted love for Hong Kong." 
  The Liberal Party headed by its leader Allen Lee supported 
the move on the grounds that a one-month deadline be stipulated. 
But some others disagreed with the view. 
  Philip Wong, who opposed the reform bill, told the 
Legislative Council that by tabling bill to the Legislative 
Council before any agreement is reached between the Governments 
of China and Britain, Chris Patten has placed the Legislative 
Council above the two sovereign states, indicating that the 
British side had no sincerity to cooperate with China. The 
reform bill would mislead local residents, he said. 
  Another legislator Lau Wong-fat criticized the Hong Kong 
authorities for tabling the reform bill without consultation 
with the Chinese side. "This action does not tally with the 
interests of Hong Kong," he said. 
  In fact, Lau added, the electoral arrangements, which are to 
last only two or three years, would undermine the basis for the 
Sino- British cooperation and cause confusion and instability in 
Hong Kong in the latter half of the transitional period. 
  Peggy Lam MBE [member of the Order of the British Empire] 
stated that the political reform bill proposed by Governor 
Patten in October 1992 has caused the relations between the 
Chinese mainland, Britain and Hong Kong to deteriorate and made 
local residents feel hopeless. 
  The Chinese side has time and again said that the 
arrangements on the 1994-95 election can be discussed so long as 
the British side shows its sincerity. But the Hong Kong 
Government unilaterally advanced a reform package in disregard 
of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and went on to submit it 
to the Legislative Council, thus ditching the last chance for 
China and Britain to resume their talks, she said. 
  It is the Hong Kong authorities that have compelled the 
Chinese side to make its own preparations, she added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Speaking in 
self-defense in the Legislative Council [Legco] this afternoon, 
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten repeated his hackneyed remarks 
about his so- called "disbelief" that China would start a new 
kitchen in 1997, without recognizing the political model 
practiced unilaterally by the British Hong Kong authorities. 
Earlier, veteran British legislator Du Ye Xien [Elsie Tu] 
refuted this absurd argument in Legco, citing remarks made by 
the British foreign secretary two and a half years ago. 
[sentence as received] 
  In a motion filed with Legco requesting the postponement of 
a 
debate about Patten's plan, Du Ye Xien said: "Transferring 
sovereignty and implementing the Basic Law in Hong Kong in 1997 
are a very solemn affair for China. China's establishment of 
the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, as well as 
remarks about starting a so-called new kitchen, are all 
preparations for this major event." 
  She pointed out: "Of course, some people say that if the 
British Government's political model is established in 1995, the 
Chinese Government will not dare replace it in 1997. To those 
who believe this, I would like to quote British Foreign 
Secretary Hurd's remarks to the British House of Commons on 16 
February 1990. It was only some 30 months between the time he 
made such remarks and the time he abruptly changed course to 
support Mr. Patten's political reform draft bill. The remarks 
went like this: `People who believe that in 1997, the Chinese 
Government will accept all that we are currently doing are 
divorced from reality.' These remarks really came from Mr. 
Hurd." 
  After repeating the above remarks by Hurd, Du Ye Xien said: 
"Let us use Mr. Hurd's remarks for verification purposes. Are 
his current actions and the government he represents divorced 
from reality? Who in Hong Kong will be so naive as to think 
that China will allow this British model to continue after 1997? 
The Chinese Government has repeatedly said in unequivocal terms 
that this is a matter of national dignity."

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten announced here this afternoon that his 
government is to gazette the remaining part of the reform bill 
tomorrow and introduce it to the Legislative Council on March 9. 
  The announcement was made by Governor Patten in a speech 
delivered before the start of a debate on the Legislative 
Council this afternoon. 
  The move was followed by the approval of the first part of 
Patten's proposal for electoral reform at the Legislative 
Council early this morning. 
  Patten's government also published a White Paper which 
revealed contents of the 17 rounds of Sino-British talks on the 
arrangements for the 1994-95 election in Hong Kong in disregard 
of China's demand for publication through diplomatic channels. 
Some 200,000 English and Chinese copies of the white paper were 
distributed to the public here today. 
  The Chinese Government pointed out from the very beginning 
that the political reform bill proposed by Chris Patten in 
October 1992 violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
Basic Law of the future Special Administrative Region of Hong 
Kong and the understandings and agreements already reached 
between China and Britain. 
  However, the British Hong Kong authorities introduced parts 
of the bill to the Legislative Council on December 15, 1993. 
The move led to the termination of the Sino-British talks on 
the arrangements for the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong. 
  The Chinese side stated on many occasions China will accept 
no bills passed by the Legislative Council before any agreement 
is reached between the Governments of China and Britain. 
  China also urged the British side to face the fact that 
without agreements with China, the three-tier councils, which 
serve as parts of the political structure of the British Hong 
Kong authorities, will be dismantled when the British rule over 
Hong Kong terminates on July 30, 1997. However, the British 
side has ignored all these advices from the Chinese side and 
clung obstinately on its own course. 
  The escalation of the Sino-British confrontation over the 
1994-95 electoral arrangement in Hong Kong added some 
unfavorable elements to the already violent stock market, 
dragging the Hang Seng index, the key indicator of the local 
blue chips, down 331 points today with thin trading.

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Chengbin (1327 2110 2430)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Zhang Junsheng, deputy 
director of XINHUA's Hong Kong branch, stated here this evening 
that Britain's unilateral move to publicize the contents of the 
Sino- British negotiations is for the purpose of deceiving the 
Hong Kong people and misleading public opinion. He said that 
the publication fully shows that Britain has constantly not 
abided by its diplomatic accords, and that China certainly will 
respond accordingly. 
  Zhang Junsheng made the above statement when interviewed at 
a 
spring reception given by the social work department of XINHUA's 
Hong Kong branch. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: The Sino-British negotiations on Hong 
Kong's 1994-95 elections were conducted between representatives 
sent by the Chinese and British governments. Now the 
negotiations have broken down and Britain will publicize the 
contents of the negotiations. Although we are not against their 
publication, the contents of the negotiations should not be 
publicized until the two countries have held diplomatic 
consultations, because it was clearly stated beforehand that the 
contents of the negotiations are confidential. Without holding 
any diplomatic consultations, Britain has now taken a unilateral 
move to compile and publicize the so- called "white paper" in 
which it has said what it wanted to say for the purpose of 
deceiving the Hong Kong people and misleading public opinion. 
Is it not very clear that Britain has violated diplomatic 
norms? Is it not very clear that it has not abided by its 
diplomatic accords? 
  Zhang Junsheng said: The so-called Sino-British disputes 
that have continued for more than a year are caused by Britain's 
failure to abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration, by its 
own promise that the development of Hong Kong's political system 
must converge with the Basic Law, and by the memorandum of 
understanding and accords reached between China and Britain. 
Now it has unilaterally publicized the contents of the 17 
rounds of negotiations. Is it not very clear that Britain has 
not abided by its diplomatic accords? 
  Zhang Junsheng said: "We expected that China and Britain 
could cooperate very well on the issue of Hong Kong, but now 
Britain has seriously undermined the foundation of cooperation. 
Under such circumstances, Britain still acts as if nothing has 
happened. Is this not an act of deceiving others as well as 
itself?" Zhang Junsheng stressed time and again that Britain's 
unilateral move to publicize the contents of the negotiations is 
for the purpose of deceiving the Hong Kong people and misleading 
public opinion, and that China certainly will respond 
accordingly.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "British Side Has Gone Further on </F>
`Three-Violation' Path"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's partial political 
reform bill was endorsed by the Legislative Council yesterday 
evening. The British Hong Kong authorities prepared to make 
public its version of the details of Sino-British talks on the 
political system today, and will subsequently table the 
remaining portion of Patten's political reform bill to the 
Legislative Council. This series of actions indicates that the 
British side has resolved to abandon the Sino-British 
cooperation and will stubbornly go further and further along the 
erroneous road of the "three violations." 
  The Legislative Council before 1997 is an organization set 
up 
by the British. In this council, there are official and 
appointed members designated by the British side, and there are 
also members of pro-British elements who have been fostered by 
it for a long time. Hence, it is without doubt that the 
political reform bill was approved by the Council. In spite of 
all this, Elsie Tu, chairman of the Council's Internal Affairs 
Committee, who has strived for democracy for Hong Kong outside 
the Council for many years, continued to express her views in a 
clear-cut stance and called on the Council to block the bill by 
laying bare the "constitutional package" put forward by the 
British side for the purpose of disrupting Sino-British 
cooperation rather than offering democracy to Hong Kong people. 
  In general, Hong Kong people do not want to see the dispute 
between China and Britain, and the Chinese side has always 
expressed its hope to avoid this political controversy and 
willingness to seek an agreement through talks. However, the 
British side unilaterally terminated the talks and took further 
actions to completely eliminate any possibility of resuming 
talks. Under these circumstances, the Chinese side has 
explicitly indicated that it will not recognize any decision 
unilaterally made by the British side on the three-tier 
structure for Hong Kong. Similar to other pertinent decisions 
made by the British Hong Kong authorities, the vote the 
Legislative Council made last night will automatically cease to 
be in force on 30 June 1997, along with the termination of 
British rule in Hong Kong. The result of the "marathon" debate 
before the voting last night will prove to be a very short-lived 
one. 
  After 1997, the structure of councils in Hong Kong will be 
reorganized in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 
Basic Law. Sir Percy Cradock, former British foreign affairs 
adviser to the prime minister, also pointed out: The British 
change of policies and the perverse acts of Patten will only 
lead Britain to a situation in which it is unable to put in a 
word on the arrangements in Hong Kong after 1997. 
  The development of events has enabled Hong Kong people to 
see 
even more clearly that since Patten put forth his constitutional 
package, the British side has deviated from the Sino-British 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, abandoned the 
understandings already reached between the two countries, and 
acted willfully and unilaterally to make its own set of 
political arrangements for Hong Kong. The 17 rounds of talks 
which began last summer were only British tricks to disguise its 
disruption of Sino-British cooperation. According to the 
original agreement reached between China and Britain, the talks 
on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements for Hong Kong should be 
conducted on the basis of the "three conformities," but from 
beginning to end the British side stubbornly persisted in the 
"three violations." The course of the 17 rounds of talks is a 
precise reflection of the British side breaking faith, playing 
tricks, and repeatedly going back on its words. Releasing the 
process of talks and disclosing the actual facts will certainly 
help the Hong Kong people see clearly the true color of the 
inglorious colonial hard-liners. It is precisely because the 
Sino- British talks were consultations at the diplomatic level, 
which both sides agreed to keep secret before the talks began, 
and because some Hong Kong people still cherished the hope of 
resuming talks that the Chinese side has refrained from 
releasing the details of the talks. Now the British side wanted 
to be the first to publicize the contents of talks. The British 
Hong Kong authorities are not at all qualified to decide on the 
disclosure of Sino-British talks at the diplomatic level. This 
one-sided decision is another act of breaking promises. The 
hurried release of the British Hong Kong authorities' own 
version of negotiations was simply aimed at producing an effect 
of prejudicing people by preconceived ideas and at continuing to 
fool the masses and deceive the world. However, the facts are 
laid before us, and people understand very clearly whether the 
British side has clung to Patten's bill or has sincerely sought 
an agreement with the Chinese side, and who has taken action to 
close the door of negotiations. The British side is removing 
the cover of secrecy and will only expose its own ugliness. 
  The British side has obstinately taken the "three-violation" 
path to disrupt Sino-British cooperation and has infringed upon 
the interests of Hong Kong people. The failure of convergence 
before and after 1997 will certainly bring about an onslaught on 
the smooth transfer of state power. The size of the onslaught 
will hinge on how various preparatory tasks for the takeover are 
being conducted by the Chinese Government and the Hong Kong 
people. It is gratifying to see that the Preliminary Working 
Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region has accelerated its work, and 
personalities from various strata in Hong Kong are more 
concerned about various kinds of preparations to welcome the 
arrival of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong being ruled 
by Hong Kong people." By 1997 the political structure of 
three-tier councils set up by the British side will be dissolved 
and reorganized, the state power of "Hong Kong being ruled by 
the Hong Kong people" will really be established under Chinese 
sovereignty, and the pro-British state power left over and 
arranged by the British side to foment splits and engage in 
independence or semi-independence will be overthrown. This is a 
serious political mission, and the Chinese people will 
conscientiously cope with it in this trial of strength. Just as 
Sir Percy Cradock pointed out: The difference in strength is 
significant. We are not strong but pretend to be otherwise.

  [Text] Yesterday morning, the Legislative Council passed 
the partial constitutional package submitted to it by Governor 
Chris Patten. Patten also spoke personally to the Legislative 
Council yesterday afternoon in order to continue to cheat Hong 
Kong people. After that, the British Government and the British 
Hong Kong authorities flagrantly violated the principle of 
keeping the talks confidential and unilaterally published the 
White Paper "Representative Government in Hong Kong" to reveal 
the contents of the Sino-British talks, in which they 
deliberately distorted and covered up the fact that the British 
side, especially Chris Patten, undermined the Sino-British talks 
in an attempt to shirk the historical responsibilities that they 
should bear. 
  Chris Patten came to Hong Kong to take office as governor in 
1992, and he brought with him a sinister intention. At home, he 
was discarded by a British constituency, and lost his 
opportunity to play tricks in British political circles. He 
thus accepted the appointment to the Hong Kong governorship. 
Before the British policymakers decided to send Patten to Hong 
Kong, they spied out the land and made their own judgment on the 
international situation and China's future prospects. The 
British press has revealed this many times. The reunification 
of Germany, the political changes in some East European 
countries, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union made the 
gentlemen in London feel that they might again hold high their 
colonialist banner, or at least play the game of election 
politics, which they thought that they were good at, in Hong 
Kong against China in order to create a political structure 
similar to that in Britain before 1997 by changing Hong Kong's 
existing system. They also planned to put an "elite" they had 
painstakingly fostered for their colony inside Hong Kong's 
political structure, thus turning Hong Kong into an independent 
or semi-independent political entity and prolonging de facto 
British rule in Hong Kong so that they might continue to gain 
political and economic interests from Hong Kong. They even had 
a very fantastic idea, being blinded by lust for gain, and 
thought that the Chinese Government would soon collapse and 
China would become divided, so they did not scruple to violate 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the seven diplomatic 
letters exchanged by the two foreign ministers on the Hong Kong 
political structure, challenge the Basic Law that they hated to 
the very marrow of their bones, and set various obstacles to the 
future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. 
  As soon as he took office in Hong Kong, Patten began to 
prepare for making major changes in Hong Kong's political 
structure according to the plan he had brought from London. His 
action was one taken by London as the spearhead of the new China 
policy. In order to change Hong Kong's existing system, Patten 
wantonly damaged the consultation mechanism specified by the 
Joint Declaration, and unilaterally dished out a so-called 
constitutional reform package, the impact of which he tried to 
make extend beyond 1997, without consulting the Chinese side. 
It was certain that the package would encounter the Chinese 
side's criticism and rejection. For the sake of Hong Kong's 
smooth transition, and also in order to observe the deeds of the 
British side while listening to its words and to give the 
British Government an opportunity to change course, the Chinese 
side agreed to hold talks with the British side on the 1994-95 
election arrangements for Hong Kong. However, for the British 
side, the talks were just a fraud. They took the talks as a 
means of playing tricks, and tried by every possible means to 
achieve the purpose of putting Patten's package into practice. 
Therefore, they called for holding talks one day, and refused 
to talk another. On the one hand, they pretended to be willing 
to reach a compromise with the Chinese side; on the other hand, 
they actively made arrangements for forcing the Legislative 
Council to pass Patten's package and put it into practice while 
the talks were going on. In their plan, the talks only served 
the purpose of implementing Patten's package, so they were only 
willing to talk about what was favorable to the implementation 
of Patten's package, and refused to talk about what was not 
favorable to the implementation of Patten's package. This was 
exactly what they wanted to do in the talks. In the 17 rounds 
of talks, Patten did his utmost to deceive public opinion, and 
this was also a fact witnessed by all. Patten's show in the 
last two days was just the epilogue to the fraud, because their 
real features had been completely laid bare and they would not 
be able to deceive people any longer. In Hong Kong and 
overseas, Patten is now bogged down in an increasingly isolated 
position, just like the British cabinet led by John Major, which 
is now besieged on all sides. 
  The British side and Patten tried to describe the dispute 
between China and Britain as a difference over whether there 
should be democracy for Hong Kong or not. This was the point 
expressed by the white paper published by them yesterday. In 
fact, this was just an out-and-out lie. In reality, the dispute 
just reflected the sharp confrontation between the Chinese 
side's "three conformities" and the British side's "three 
violations" and the serious difference between the Chinese 
side's adherence to abiding by diplomatic agreements and the 
British side's behavior of ignoring its international 
commitments. To put it more clearly, this was the contradiction 
between the Chinese side's determination to resume the exercise 
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the British side's attempt to 
hinder and undermine the process of China's resuming the 
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. No matter what 
blandishments the British side and Patten offered, and no matter 
how the authors of the British white paper engaged in 
phrase-mongering, the facts could never be obliterated. Of 
course, they would just be working to no avail if they tried to 
shirk the British side's responsibility for undermining the 
talks. 
  The biggest mistake Patten and his like have made is that 
they still think like their ancestors in the 19th century 
although they are living in last decade of the 20th century. 
They think that they are still facing the decadent Qing 
government and that the Western system and values must be 
imposed on Asia. Such conceit and such an arrogant attitude has 
been scathingly denounced by many leaders of Asian countries. 
Patten and his like absolutely have no right to talk about 
democracy and freedom in Hong Kong, because it is China's 
territory. The British colonial authorities will have to quit 
in just 40 months. The three-tier councils they are going to 
rig up in Hong Kong will certainly be disbanded and reorganized 
after they leave. Patten's fraud will bring no benefit to 
Britain. People who originally conceived illusions about Patten 
have also seen clearly that it is the British side that will 
eventually incur losses as it refuses to cooperate with the 
Chinese side. Yesterday, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
of the State Council and a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry 
separately issued statements on the fact that Patten's 
constitutional package had been passed in part by the 
Legislative Council, and pointed out that the practice of the 
British side had tightly closed the door to the resumption of 
talks. The behavior of the British side has damaged the 
foundation for Sino-British cooperation, and will inevitably 
sour the atmosphere for the settlement of the new airport 
problems and other problems. As Patten and his like perversely 
stick to their course, they will certainly eat their own bitter 
fruit. People may wait and see if they do not believe this will 
come true.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Feb 25 (AFP)--Hong Kong Governor Chris 
Patten on Friday published the second part of his controversial 
1997 democratic reform package which will extend voting rights 
to about 2.7 million people in the territory. Ignoring China's 
vehement objections, he published the bill in the government 
gazette, less than 24 hours after the Legislative Council 
approved the first phase of his reform plans. 
  Publication immediately sent the local stock exchange 
plunging, with the Hang Seng index down nearly five percent at 
the opening, pushing it below the 10,000 point level for the 
first time in three months. It had already fallen 3.1 percent 
Thursday following the Legislative Council's approval of the 
first phase with investors worried by the worsening Sino-British 
relations. China told Britain Thursday that the door was now 
firmly closed on negotiations and said it would scrap whatever 
political system Britain put in place when it resumed 
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. 
  The latest reform bill, which must be adopted by July, will 
dramatically extend the voting franchise so that all 2.7 million 
Hong Kong workers can elect people to 30 seats in the 
legislature reserved for special interest groups. "This will 
broaden the franchise for the commercial, industrial, finance 
and financial services, real estate and construction, tourism, 
social services, and labour functional constituencies," a 
government spokesman said. He said the bill would be introduced 
in the Legislative Council on March 9. 
  China has also expressed its anger over Britain 's 
publication of a 36-page White Paper on why seven months of 
negotiatons with China on Hong Kong's poltical future collapsed 
in November. Beijing has promised "due action" in return, but 
has not specified what this will be. In the White Paper -- of 
which 200,000 copies are being distributed in Hong Kong -- 
Britain alleged that China had refused to clarify whether it 
would retroactively apply a ban on legislators it considered 
were involved in "undermining the socialist system in the 
mainland."

  [Text] Geneva, February 24 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese 
representative to the UN Human Rights Commission said today that 
the organization should strictly follow the UN charter if it 
truly wants to help realize human rights and basic human freedom. 
  Zhang Yishan, vice-representative of China to the 
commission, 
said that the reason why so many countries have called for 
rationalizing the commission's work is that it has deviated from 
the UN charter's purpose and principles in many cases. 
  Such deviations are not good for the promotion of 
international cooperation in human rights and the general 
realization of human rights and basic human freedom, he said. 
China supports such calls for rationalization, he added. 
  He said it is imperative to eliminate such malpratices and 
abnormalities such as politicizing human rights issues, 
employing double standards toward other countries, and using 
human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in other 
nations' internal affairs. 
  He said that some countries are extremely self-important and 
relentless in attacking others for human rights violations while 
still claiming that they are following the international 
standards of human rights. 
  He noted that the practice of exerting pressure on some 
nations by adopting resolutions is absurd and will not truly 
help improve their human rights records. 
  He pointed out that for some countries, it seems to be their 
god- given right to accuse others of human rights violations 
except themselves. 
  He said that this is both anachronistic and unhelpful for 
the 
efforts to truly promote human rights. 
  He also asked the commission to fully discuss the issues 
that 
concern the developing countries most. 
  He said one of the few achievements of the commission last 
year is that it recognized the indivisibility of all kinds of 
human rights, including the right to development and the right 
to have different economic, culture and social systems.

  [Text] Washington, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The Clinton 
administration sent to Congress here today a legislation to 
reform the country's export administration act of 1979, which 
imposed "inefficient and obsolete" control of Cold War era on 
exports. 
  The renewed Export Administration Act, according to Commerce 
Secretary Ron Brown, represented a "very, very important effort" 
and was "the first comprehensive effort to reform export control 
licensing in 15 years." 
  "The legislation strikes the critical balance that is much 
needed between (nuclear) nonproliferation concerns and economic 
interests in our export control regime," Brown told a press 
conference. 
  Among the regulatory changes, officials disclosed, are to 
decontrol computers to most Western countries up to 1,000 
million theoretical operations per second (mtops), which include 
most of the desktop office machines. 
  For the countries which U.S. said it has nuclear 
proliferation concerns, the decontrol was moved up to 500 mtops, 
and for the few countries facing U.S. trade embargo, the 
decontrol of computers will be allowed to 260 mtops. 
  Last September, as part of the national export strategy, the 
Multi-agency Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) 
agreed to a substantial increase from the computers at the level 
of 12.5 mtops, which is an old Apple Macintosh computer. 
  The new regulation for supercomputers was also raised from 
195 mtops, to 1,500 mtops. "This is part of the effort to get 
rid of obsolete Cold War controls that had no effect on 
proliferation," said Barry Carter, undersecretary of commerce 
for export administration. 
  The computer decontrol announced last September is expected 
to generate 30 billion U.S. dollars of exports a year for the 
U.S. Trade in computer and telecommunications sources said. 
  The administration officials, meanwhile, stressed that 
"we're 
halfway to home now," saying that they are going to consult with 
congress and the business community for "even more constructive 
changes." 
  In the new legislation, the administration stressed to use 
multilateral efforts in export control, improve the U.S. ability 
to prevent nuclear proliferation, and streamline export control 
system. 
  The proposed act, which is a combined effort of the commerce 
department, the defense department and the state department, 
also stressed to harmonize U.S. sanction laws against the 
countries with missiles and missile parts, chemical and 
biological weapons.

  [Text] Dhaka, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Bangladesh Foreign 
Minister A.S.M. Mustafizur Rahman hosted a banquet on Thursday 
[24 February] evening in honor of the visiting Chinese 
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen . 
  Qian Qichen arrived here on Thursday at 14:00 for a four-day 
official goodwill visit to this South Asian country. Bangladesh 
is the second leg of his five-country tour including Pakistan, 
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Iran. 
  At the welcoming banquet, the Bangladesh foreign minister 
said, "China is a valuable friend of Bangladesh. We cherish 
this friendship." 
  The Bangladesh foreign minister praised China in its 
modernizing drive and economic reforms. He believed China will 
play an increasingly important role in global trade and economic 
relations. 
  The Bangladesh foreign minister also briefed Chinese guests 
on the ongoing market-oriented economic reforms and 
poverty-alleviation efforts in his country. 
  In his speech, the Chinese vice-premier said, "Under the 
personal care of the leaders of our two countries, the two sides 
are carrying out fruitful cooperation in the economic, trade, 
scientific and technological, cultural and other fields and have 
supported each other and cooperated closely in international 
affairs." 
  Qian said that developing countries should strengthen 
coordination and cooperation to preserve peace and stability, 
promote common economic growth so as to establish a new 
international political and economic order. 
  Qian also praised Bangladesh for its unremitting efforts in 
promoting good-neighborly and friendly relations among the SAARC 
[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] countries and 
in enhancing regional cooperation. 
  Qian described the recent allegations about the so-called 
"China threat" and even China's expansion into the Indian Ocean 
as absurd and utterly groundless. "We have made it clear on 
many occasions that China unswervingly pursues an independent 
foreign policy of peace and will never seek hegemony," he said. 
  He stressed, "China is and will remain a force for 
preserving 
world peace and stability."

  [Text] Tokyo, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- Chinese State Council 
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji met Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa and other 
officials of the Federation of Economic Organizations 
(Keidanren) of Japan at the Shin Otani Hotel in Tokyo this 
evening, and accepted an invitation to attend a banquet hosted 
in his honor by the Keidanren. 
  Zhu Rongji spoke highly of the precious contribution made by 
friends of the Keidanren over a long time to the development of 
Sino-Japanese trade and economic cooperation, and gave a 
briefing on the current state of China's reform at the request 
of people in Japan's economic circles. He said: This year is a 
crucial one for China's economic reform. Many important reform 
measures were introduced at the beginning of this year. These 
reform measures were drawn up on the basis of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. They have been implemented for more than 50 
days and are making relatively smooth progress. This further 
strengthens our resolve to promote reform. In the process of 
drawing up reform bills, we used the experience of developed 
countries, including Japan, in economic development. 
  Keidanren officials, including Hiraiwa, said: Japan is very 
interested in China's economic development. The Keidanren set 
up its China Committee in May last year to promote the 
development of Japanese-Chinese economic relations. 
  Senior personnel in the entourage, including He Chunlin, 
deputy secretary general of the State Council General Office, 
were present at the meeting and were invited to attend the 
banquet in the evening. 
  Zhu Rongji also met Chairman Kosaku Inaba of the Japan 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry [JCCI] at the Shin Otani Hotel 
this afternoon. 
  During the meeting, Zhu Rongji said: "The timing of my visit 
to Japan is very good. This year is a crucial one for China's 
economic reform. Japanese friends have been following with 
interest the economic situation in China. One of the purposes 
of my visit to Japan is to introduce China's domestic economic 
situation. Markets and prices are now stable in China, and so 
is the general mood of the people there." 
  Zhu Rongji said: "This year is also important for Japan. 
The Japanese Government wants to take some important measures 
to stimulate economic development. The timely exchange of views 
between China and Japan is very necessary for the two countries 
in improving mutual understanding and developing cooperation." 
  Inaba said that, when he visited China last year, Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji suggested that the JCCI organize a delegation 
to visit China every year. Inaba said: The JCCI followed up 
the suggestion. This year, it is preparing to organize a 
delegation to visit cities in central and west China to conduct 
survey.

  [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- President Jiang 
Zemin and other top Chinese leaders tonight attended a reception 
to mark the traditional Lantern Festival together with 200 
representatives of the intellectual lights of Beijing. 
  The other leaders were Premier Li Peng, Qiao Shi, chairman 
of 
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li 
Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, Liu Huaqing, 
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, Hu Jintao, a 
Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese 
Communist Party Central Committee, and Vice-President Rong Yiren. 
  On behalf of the party Central Committee, Hu Jintao extended 
festival greetings to intellectuals all over China and expressed 
thanks for their contributions to the country's reforms, opening 
up and modernization drive. 
  He expressed the hope that, guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and led by 
the party Central Committee headed by Jiang Zemin, Chinese 
intellectuals will make still greater contributions to the 
prosperity and development of such areas as arts and literature, 
science and technology, education, theoretic research and 
journalism. 
  He also wished China greater vitality and prosperity. 
  While enjoying a melody played on the pipa (a plucked string 
instrument with a fretted fingerboard), Jiang said, "The pipa is 
our national artistic form and we should carry forward the 
tradition of our national arts." 
  While listening to the song entitled "The Guerrilla Song," 
the leader said, "this is an immortal piece of work."

  [Text] Xian, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The problem of a 
stalling spiral, which had been taboo in test flights and flight 
training for the Chinese Air Forces, was recently tackled by 
37-year-old Lu Jun, a test flight pilot of the Aviation 
Industries of China. 
  Lu's success filled a blank page in the history of the 
Chinese aviation industry, according to experts of the Test 
Flight Research Institute of China. 
  When a stalling spiral happens, an airplane stalls in 
mid-air 
and drops spinning at an accelerating speed, which leads to a 
crash. 
  For decades, the test has not been tried on advanced 
Chinese-made fighters. But Lu Jun took on the task last 
December, and succeeded in 78 stalling spirals during 21 flights 
in a new type of Chinese-made airplane at an altitude of 11,000 
m. 
  Lu has test-flown airplanes of ten models in three kinds in 
the past.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 25 (AFP)--Some 10,000 Chinese firms 
were sold or merged last year, as local governments took 
advantage of property rights reform to invigorate loss-making 
state enterprises, a senior economic official said Friday [25 
February]. Medium-sized and small state firms "with less than 
desirable management and profits" were sold, transferred or 
merged amid the introduction of new legislation aimed at 
clarifying the murky issue of property rights, said Jia Hefing 
of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring (SCER). 
  In China's 16 largest cities, 2,900 medium-sized and small 
firms were sold or merged, and property rights worth six billion 
yuan (700 million dollars) were effectively made productive, Jia 
said. Recent reforms have seen an increasing number of firms 
from different regions or sectors being merged, Jia said, citing 
enterprises in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen which have taken 
over others by buying their stock. According to Jia, the 
growing number of pilot companies going public in China has 
provided a major boost to property rights reform. 
  There are currently 3,800 pilot stock companies nationwide. 
China recently promulgated a series of laws and regulations, 
such as the bankruptcy law and corporate law which provide a 
partial, legal framework for defining property rights. 
  However, according to a senior lawyer with a western law 
firm 
in Beijing, a comprehensive property rights law is still a long 
way off. "The authorities have been considering it for some 
time, but it's a complex and sensitive issue," the lawyer said. 
"For the moment they seem content to muddle through with the 
existing regulations, which are still far from adequate," he 
added. 
  The SCER has pledged to clarify property rights which, 
together with ending management interference by bureaucrats and 
allowing firms to go bankrupt, are considered essential to the 
reform of inefficient state enterprises in China, which continue 
to be a major drain on government coffers.

<F P=106> [By Zong He (1350 4421): "While Inspecting Grass-Roots </F>
Units Recently, Lu Rongjing Stressed: Value Opportunities, Pay 
Attention To Refraining From Complacency, Press On to the Finish 
Without Letup, and Sustain the Favorable Momentum for 
Development"] 
  [Text] We are at a crucial stage whereby, if we push on, we 
may succeed, whereas if we slacken our efforts, we will fail. 
Various localities must comprehensively understand and 
earnestly implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 10th (enlarged) plenum 
of the fifth Anhui provincial party committee; we must 
persistently endure hardships, press on to the finish without 
letup, seize favorable opportunities and make progress, and 
strive in every possible way to sustain the favorable momentum 
for development. These views have been repeatedly stressed by 
Lu Rongjing, secretary of the Anhui provincial party committee, 
during his recent inspection tour of grass-roots units. 
  Lu Rongjing was inspecting and conducting research in 
various 
localities including Fanchang, Tongling, Qingyang, Shitai, 
Guichi, and Dongzhi from 15 to 22 January. He was particularly 
interested in learning how the guidelines of the 10th (enlarged) 
plenum of the fifth Anhui provincial party committee have been 
implemented. He braved severe cold and snowstorms, visited 
deeply in rural areas and enterprises, and studied the actual 
situation through personal contacts. He also held extensive 
discussions with grass-roots cadres and the masses. Wherever he 
went, he fully affirmed and commended cadres and the masses for 
their optimistic spirits and for the large number of laudable 
examples among them. 
  Lu Rongjing said: Anhui's current situation is very good. 
Various localities are earnestly formulating and promptly 
implementing 1994's tasks according to the requirements of the 
provincial party committee and government. However, we should 
also notice that progress has not been balanced enough. After 
achieving certain accomplishments in 1993, some localities 
expressed the idea that they should take a rest, and they 
somewhat slackened their efforts in arranging and carrying out 
their work. We must attach importance to such a situation. Our 
efforts should be enhanced but not slackened, and our enthusiasm 
should be increased but not reduced. Various localities, 
especially leading comrades at various levels, must continue to 
be level-headed, and must not slacken their efforts or 
vigilance. We should value the excellent conditions, should 
seize rare opportunities, should continually promote the efforts 
and enthusiasm we displayed in our work in 1993, and should 
continue to make new efforts so as to attain a higher level of 
fresh accomplishments. 
  Lu Rongjing pointed out: A whole year's work depends on a 
good start in the spring. We should pay closer and closer 
attention to various tasks, without any letup, at the beginning 
of the year. Otherwise, if we are sluggish at the beginning, our 
initial passivity will make us lag throughout the year. At 
present, the situation is progressing very favorably: Everyone 
is competing with one another. Stopping or moving slowly is 
considered regression. Time passes very swiftly, and it will be 
very difficult to catch up later. All of us must fully 
understand the aforementioned concept. The Spring Festival is 
approaching very soon. Our tasks in various fields are very 
heavy. We should make overall plans after taking all factors 
into consideration, should emphasize key tasks, and should 
properly make corresponding arrangements. While strictly and 
properly carrying out various other tasks, we should not 
slacken, even for a moment, our efforts, particularly on 
economic work, so as to lay a good foundation for competently 
completing all the tasks in 1994. 

    Lu Rongjing stressed: Our key to accomplishing the tasks 
laid down by the 10th plenum of the fifth Anhui provincial party 
committee lies in strictly carrying out various tasks. At 
present, our reform tasks have entered a stage whereby we have 
to comprehensively resolve tough problems and a lot of work has 
become more complicated. They include ways to fulfill the 
requirements for establishing a modern enterprise system, how to 
further invigorate enterprises, how to gear up for the market, 
and ways to accelerate economic restructuring in the 
agricultural sector. We need to make great efforts to study and 
resolve many deep-seated contradictions and problems in the 
aforementioned issues. Leading cadres at various levels should 
truly involve themselves, should earnestly collect and 
understand firsthand information, should conscientiously 
summarize the creative work of the broad masses of cadres and 
people during their actual practice of it, and should provide 
specific guidance under various categories so as to help cadres 
and people at the lower level promptly resolve their actual 
existing problems. We should implement a rigorous 
responsibility system so that every task will be earnestly 
carried out. 
  Wherever he went, Lu Rongjing visited peasants' families, 
expressed concern for their well-being, and meticulously 
inquired about their production and lives. He repeatedly told 
local responsible cadres who accompanied him: We must be 
concerned for the masses' lives. We must warmly express 
concerns, particularly for households which have been guaranteed 
that they will be provided with clothing, food, housing, and 
medical services during their lifetimes, and funeral services 
when they die; for destitute families, and for dependents and 
family members of active-duty service members and of 
revolutionary martyrs. We must constantly get to know their 
living conditions and must render timely assistance to them if 
they have difficulties. Before the Spring Festival arrives, 
various localities should mobilize and organize personnel in 
various sectors to launch warmth-extending campaigns so as to 
enable the broad masses of people to happily enjoy a pleasant 
lunar new year. 
  During his inspection tour, Lu Rongjing also visited some 
military garrisons, where he called on and extended festive 
greetings to officers and service members. 
  Accompanying him in the inspection tour were Fang Zhaoxiang, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; Ji Jiahong 
[1323 1367 1347], secretary general of the provincial party 
committee; and Lu Jiafeng [4151 1367 0023], deputy secretary 
general of the provincial party committee and director of the 
provincial party committee policy research center.

  [Text] Nanchang, February 24 (XINHUA) -- A 
120-kilometer-long industrial corridor in east China's Jiangxi 
Province has developed rapidly during recent years. 
  Starting from the provincial capital of Nanchang in the 
south 
and ending at Jiujiang, a port city on the Chang Jiang in the 
north, the industrial corridor is expected to become the pillar 
of the local economy in the foreseeable future. 
  The corridor's total industrial output value topped 26 
billion yuan last year, with a growth of about 40 percent over 
that of 1992. 
  The amount of foreign investment utilized, which was 135 
million yuan, has also more than doubled that of the previous 
year. 
  First established in 1992, the corridor has witnessed a 
conspicuous improvement in its investment environment since then. 
  Nanchang-Jiujiang first-rate highway and the second phase of 
Jiujiang electricity factory project have been put into 
operation in succession. 
  The 2,780-meter-long Nanchang Bridge over the Ganjiang has 
also opened to traffic, alleviating local traffic jams. 
  Thirty-seven communication projects have been completed and 
the number of computer-controlled telephone sets installed have 
reached 143,500. 
  The eight provincial development zones along the industrial 
corridor totally earmarked 200 million yuan for infrastructure 
constructions last year. 
  By now, blessed with the best transportation and 
communication conditions and most advanced energy industry in 
the province, regions along the corridor have aroused interest 
of more and more foreign investors. 
  In 1993, newly-approved foreign-invested projects reached 
764, with a contracted investment of 610 million U.S. dollars. 
Among them, 145 have started business and been put into 
operation and 250 of them are under construction.

<F P=106> [By reporter Fang Zhengjun (2455 2398 6511) and </F>
correspondent Sun Baoguo (1327 0202 0948)] 
  [Text] Wuhan, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- The state security organ 
in Hubei Province recently uncovered a case involving a spy sent 
by Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT); and arrested the spy, Liu Hui 
(0491 1741), in accordance with the law in close coordination 
with the state security organ in Yunnan Province. 
  It was learned that 26-year old Liu Hui was formally a sales 
manager of a company in Hubei's Huangshi city. In March 1992, 
he illegally left the country and was recruited by a foreign 
branch of the military intelligence bureau of Taiwan's KMT. He 
received espionage training and operational funds. In August 
the same year, he was sent by the military intelligence bureau 
of Taiwan's KMT back to the mainland and laid low under the 
cover of conducting business. After returning to Hubei, Liu Hui 
went to Wuhan, Huangshi, and other places to incite defection 
and develop a spy network. He attempted to infiltrate our key 
departments. Meanwhile, he also sent intelligence related to 
our country's secrets to Taiwan's espionage organization. 
  Liu Hui candidly confessed his espionage activities after 
being arrested in accordance with the law. The case is being 
investigated and handled.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- Delegates from Taiwan and 
the United States began three days of negotiations here Thursday 
[24 February] on tariff reductions. 
  Taiwan is required to hold tariff reduction talks with 
member 
countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a 
condition to gaining membership in the world trade body. 
  Taiwan hopes agreements reached at this round of 
negotiations 
will set the tone for its subsequent negotiations with other 
GATT members. 
  Vice Economics Minister Sheu Ke-sheng [Hsu K'e-sheng] and 
Assistant US Trade Representative for GATT Affairs Dorothy 
Dwoskin are the chief negotiators for the two sides. Sheu [Hsu] 
heads up a 170-person delegation. 
  According to sources at the talks, the United States is 
likely to request that Taiwan agree to the bilateral elimination 
of tariffs on 2,172 products. 
  Last year the United States asked Taiwan to lower tariff 
rates on industrial and agricultural goods to 10 and 20 percent, 
respectively. 
  The US side is also likely to claim "initial negotiation 
rights" regarding tariffs on an additional 2,786 of its export 
items to Taiwan, the sources said. 
  Other topics to be discussed include nontariff obstacles and 
Taiwan's monopoly system.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng and Zhu Yucheng Stress That the </F>
White Paper Misleads Public Opinion"] 
  [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch, criticized the British side for unilaterally 
publishing the British-compiled White Paper on Representative 
Government in Hong Kong without Sino-British consultations and 
said this deceives the community and misleads public opinion. 
He said that the Chinese side will surely make a necessary 
response. 
  After attending a private activity yesterday (24 February), 
Zhang Junsheng said that the Sino-British talks on arrangements 
for the 1994-95 elections have been thoroughly ruined by the 
British side and the fact that the British side takes this 
action now moves it farther and farther away from the road of 
Sino-British cooperation. 
  As for cooperation between China and Britain in other areas 
such as livelihood-related questions and the airport issue, 
which Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten hopes for, Zhang Junsheng 
said: The foundation of Sino-British cooperation has been torn 
down by the British side. If the British side imagines that 
nothing has happened, it is, I am afraid, deceiving itself and 
others. 
  Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, 
said that the British side has violated the principle of 
confidentiality regarding the Sino-British talks by unilaterally 
publishing the contents of the talks without mutual 
consultations, and that the so- called White Paper published by 
the British side does not fully reflect the talks. 
  Before the opening of the large carnival "Joy at Kennedy at 
the End of the Spring Festival" in the western Hong Kong branch 
of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong in 
Western District last night (24 February), Zhu Yucheng made a 
response to the British side's publication of the White Paper on 
Representative Government in Hong Kong. 
  He said: What the British has published is precisely what it 
has admitted it to be; that is, it is not all the contents of 
the talks, but only part of the contents adapted and compiled by 
the British side. The contents are not all facts. The Chinese 
side will surely make a response. 
  He said: The Chinese side stated before that it was all 
right to publish all the contents of the talks and that the 
Chinese side would agree to the end on this question. The 
Chinese side will respond to the British side's impractical 
actions which are misleading public opinion. 
  Zhu Yucheng said: The British side notified XINHUA only 
yesterday morning that it would unilaterally publish the 
contents of the talks. It was very late. 
  He criticized the British side's termination of the talks in 
the 17th round while saying repeatedly that the door to the 
talks was still open. He said that this served to deceive the 
public and mislead public opinion. 
  As for the British argument that it did not consult the 
Chinese side before publishing the contents of the talks because 
it wanted to avoid wasting time, Zhu Yucheng said it was 
unrealistic. He maintained that there would have been time if 
the two sides had wanted to carry out talks.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The 13th meeting of 
the China-EC Joint Committee was "productive, practical and 
successful," said Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and 
economic cooperation. 
  She said this at the joint press conference held here at 
noon 
today by her and Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner of the European 
Commission in charge of external economic relations and trade 
policy, upon the conclusion of the 13th meeting of the China-EC 
joint committee this morning. 
  The two sides conducted a broad discussion on China-EC 
relations at the meeting. 
  "Brittan and I briefed each other on the economic situations 
in the European Community and China, and exchanged views on 
China-EC cooperation frankly," Wu said. 
  "Talks have been held on the problems existing in bilateral 
trade and economic relations and the ways to solve them, and 
consensus has been reached in many aspects concerned." 
  It is said that the two parties agreed that all efforts 
should be made to promote a more balanced development of 
bilateral trade. 
  They decided that the working group on economic and trade 
matters, after the first meeting last year, will hold its second 
meeting in Brussels in June 1994, with specific sectoral 
discussions on agriculture, intellectual property and financial 
services. 
  The two sides also decided to hold an industrial cooperation 
meeting in the non-ferrous metal sector, to launch technical 
discussions on the alcoholic beverage sector and to organize an 
information seminar on anti-dumping in China. 
  The EC side welcomed continuation in China's reform of its 
economic and trade system and expansion of opening-up. 
  The joint committee reaffirmed that both parties will 
continue to apply the principle of non-discrimination. 
  The committee was satisfied with bilateral cooperation in 
such areas as the environment, industry and training of Chinese 
experts concerning trade policy, economics, law, management and 
telecommunications. 
  Besides, a working group on environmental cooperation is to 
be set up to analyze Chinese environmental problems and needs as 
well as to propose and coordinate concrete China-EC cooperative 
activities in this field. 
  Both parties underlined their wish to step up business 
cooperation to increase direct contacts between enterprises 
leading to more investment and other forms of industrial and 
trade cooperation. 
  A memorandum between China and the European Commission was 
signed on the establishment of the China-Europe international 
business school. 
  This afternoon, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with Sir 
Leon Brittan and his party, and they exchanged views on issues 
of common concern.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China's re-entry 
into GATT is beneficial economically both to China and the whole 
world, said Leon Brittan, commissioner of the European Community 
(EC), at a news conference here today upon the completion of the 
13th meeting of the China-EC Joint Committee. 
  "The EC not only shows its admiration for China's 
development, but is willing to promote it through trade and 
economic cooperation with China," said Brittan. "it is 
unreasonable to exclude China, the 11th largest trade country in 
the world in 1993, from GATT," Wu said. 
  The China-EC Joint Committee exchanged views on GATT matters 
and expressed its satisfaction regarding the successful 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round. 
  A release at the press conference said that the EC supports 
the successful conclusion of the negotiations on China's status 
as a contracting party to GATT as soon as possible. 
  China reaffirmed its intention to continue the reform of its 
economic and trade regimes to meet the internationally accepted 
rules, in particular those of GATT. 
  The two sides agreed to intensify their efforts, both 
bilaterally and multilaterally, to achieve a satisfactory 
outcome in these negotiations. 
  China and the EC decided to launch bilateral discussions for 
the liberalization of non-tariff measures in China. The first 
meeting will take place next March in Geneva in the framework of 
the GATT working party on China. 
  The EC side insisted on the elimination of the 
discriminatory 
provision on automobile joint ventures of the Sino-U.S. 
Memorandum of Understanding on market access of October 1992. 
  China stated that the provision on imports of auto parts 
does 
not affect the production of Sino-EC joint ventures. Both sides 
agreed to continue discussions on this issue.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 28 (AFP) -- The European Union warned 
China on Monday that any attempt to discriminate against Britain 
in trade terms because of the Sino-British row over Hong Kong 
would be totally unacceptable and have serious consequences. 
  Sparks flew at a joint press conference given here by EU 
Commissioner Leon Brittan and Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu 
Yi, which was cut short after a heated exchange over the issue 
of Hong Kong and Sino-British trade ties. 
  The press briefing followed the 13th meeting here of the 
EU-China Joint Committee, which was co-chaired by Brittan and Wu 
and focussed on the EU's support for China's re-entry to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Responding to comments by Wu that Britain's "unfriendly and 
uncooperative" stance on Hong Kong would inevitably damage 
Sino-British trade ties and economic cooperation, Brittan 
stressed that the basis of EU-China relations was 
non-dicrimination against separate EU member states. "Any 
action that discriminated against one member state on polticial 
grounds would be a very serious matter, not just for that member 
state but for the European Union as a whole," Brittan said. He 
declined to specify what action the EU might take should China 
disrupt trade ties with Britain, but the union's main leverage 
on Beijing would appear to be continued support for China's GATT 
re-entry.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 28 (AFP)--The European Union (EU) 
warned China on Monday that any attempt to discriminate against 
Britain in trade terms because of the Sino-British row over Hong 
Kong would be totally unacceptable and have serious consequences 
for EU-China ties. 
  Sparks flew at a joint press conference given here by EU 
Commissioner Leon Brittan and Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu 
Yi, which was cut short after a heated exchange over the issue 
of Hong Kong and Sino-British trade ties. 
  The press briefing followed the 13th meeting here of the 
EU-China Joint Committee, which was co-chaired by Brittan and Wu 
and focused on the EU's support for China's re-entry to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Responding to comments by Wu that Britain's "unfriendly and 
uncooperative" stance on Hong Kong would inevitably damage 
Sino-British trade ties and economic cooperation, Brittan 
stressed that EU-China relations were based on 
non-discrimination against separate EU member states. "Any 
action that discriminated against one member state on political 
grounds would be a very serious matter, not just for that member 
state but for the European Union as a whole," Brittan said. He 
declined to specify what action the EU might take should China 
disrupt trade ties with Britain, but the union's main leverage 
on Beijing would appear to be continued support for China's GATT 
re-entry. 
  Wu's suggestion that Brittan, as a British citizen, was 
especially concerned with Sino-British ties drew an angry 
response from the commissioner, who insisted that the EU's 
position would be "identical" in the case of dicrimination 
against any other member country. "It would not be acceptable," 
he added. Despite Wu's reply that her comment "was a joke," the 
press conference was abruptly cut short. 
  The question of China's trade ties with Britain was not 
actually discussed during the morning talks, but Brittan said he 
would certainly be bringing it up in the afternoon. 
  The briefing began amiably with both sides voicing optimism 
after what they described as a "frank and constructive" round of 
morning talks. Brittan said the EU was "full of admiration" for 
China's efforts to move towards a market economy, but added that 
while the EU believed China's re-entry to GATT was in the 
interests of the global community, differences on certain 
issues still remain. There are problems to resolve because 
China's development is of course remarkable but not complete," 
Brittan said, adding that the terms under which China re-enters 
the world trade body "have to be negotiated to reflect this and 
accelerate the process of refom and liberalisation." Brittan 
also said that he expressed European concerns about aspects of 
human rights in China. The commissioner had brought a draft 
protocol outlining EU proposals on how to resolve outstanding 
questions and said he hoped "progress can be made on that 
urgently." 
  For her part, Wu also admitted that differences of opinions 
remained, but stressed that both sides were willing to make 
efforts to resolve them. 
  According to a western diplomat here, the EU is concerned 
that China will strike a deal with the United States over GATT 
membership that would see Beijing making exclusive trading 
concessions to Washington at Europe's expense. In an apparent 
reference to the United States, Brittan said he had stressed 
during the morning talks that the EU's relationship with China 
"must be on the fundamental basis of non-discrimination between 
the European Union and other powers." 
  According to Chinese customs statistics, bilateral trade 
between the EU and China grew 50 percent last year to 26.1 
billion dollars, with China posting a 2.7-billion-dollar 
deficit. According to the European Union, however, China enjoys 
a growing trade surplus that amounted to 9.93 billion dollars in 
1992. EU figures for last year were unavailable.

  [Text] Washington, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States today pronounced Russian diplomat Aleksandr Iosifovich 
Lysenko as "persona non grata" relating to the arrest of a 
senior CIA agent on Monday [21 February]. 
  State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said Washington 
did not rule out further steps "against any other Russian 
diplomats who are subsequently implicated in the Ames affair." 
  McCurry was referring to Aldrich Ames, former chief of the 
Central Intelligence Agency's counterintelligence center's 
Soviet section who, together with his wife, was accused of 
selling vital CIA operations and personnel information to Moscow. 
  Lysenko, whom the U.S. said is "the chief Russian 
intelligence official" that is "in a position to be responsible 
for the Ames espionage case, was ordered to leave the United 
States within seven days, McCurry said. 
  The Russian side protested the U.S. move, McCurry said. 
  Before announcing the demarche, McCurry stressed the United 
States would continue its support for Russian reforms that 
"extremely important" to Washington. [sentence as received] 
  Earlier, President Bill Clinton urged the nation not to 
reduce or suspend aid to Moscow because helping Russian reforms 
is in the very interest of Washington. 
  Clinton argued that the bulk of U.S. aid for Russia is to 
help dismantling nuclear weapons "that were aimed at the United 
States for over four decades." 
  Besides, Clinton said, Washington's economic assistance was 
"flowing not to government, but to reformers outside Moscow, 
most in the nongovernmental sector, to help them start business 
and privatize existing businesses." 
  However, Clinton reiterated that Washington took the Ames 
spying case seriously and urged Russia to take steps required by 
the United States. 
  "The Russians ought to be at least told what we know...and 
given an opportunity to take whatever action they wanted to 
take," Clinton said. 
  Local observers said the expulsion of Lysenko was only a 
measured response to the Ames case and relations between 
Washington and Moscow would eventually resume to normal.

  [Text] Moscow, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Relations between 
the United States and Russia are facing a severe test over the 
scandal of two Russian spies which was revealed last week. 
  On February 22, the U.S. Government instituted judicial 
proceedings against Aldrich Hazen Ames, the former chief of the 
CIA's Soviet counter-intelligence branch, and his wife Maria, 
charging them with spying for the former Soviet Union and Russia. 
  Three days later, the U.S. Government expelled a Russian 
diplomat from the Russian Embassy in Washington. 
  It's widely believed that the incident will have a major 
impact on Russian-U.S. relations. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher personally handed 
an statement of protest to the Russian Embassy in Washington, 
declaring that the U.S. could not tolerate Russia installing 
spies in its country and describing the incident as a very 
serious matter. 
  Commenting on the case, U.S. President Bill Clinton 
suggested 
that as a result the U.S. will completely re-evaluate its 
foreign policy toward Russia. Many senators in the U.S. 
Congress insisted that amendments should be attached to policies 
on aid to Russia. 
  In the last two years, the United States and Russia have 
been 
seeking a strategic partnership in their relations. In January 
their presidents met in Moscow and signed a declaration 
announcing that the two countries had entered a stage of 
"strategic partnership". 
  However, there are still contradictions and differences 
between the two countries on matters of vital interests. 
  Russia has always claimed that it has "special interests and 
responsibilities" in the new republics which have emerged in the 
territories of the former Soviet Union. Russia has taken it for 
granted that it has the right to send its peace keeping troops 
into these republics and has taken economic measures to 
safeguard its interests in them. 
  Meanwhile, the United States has been using the carrot of 
economic aid to various republics and countries in the area as a 
means of containing Russia's influence. 
  The United States, for example, has supported the three 
Baltic republics in their request for the withdrawal of Russian 
troops and has offered more economic aid for the Ukraine. It 
also signed an accord of "democratic partnership" with 
Kazakhstan. 
  Observers here consider that the proposed U.S. plan for 
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 
which it has described as a "partnership for peace", poses a 
threat to Russian interests in East European countries where it 
previously had traditional influence. 
  So far, the Russian Government has kept a tight rein on its 
response to the U.S. spy allegations. The Russian intelligence 
agency has also kept silent, despite Russia's known displeasure 
about the U.S. decision to publicly announce the allegations and 
the charges without consulting it in advance. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in a statement 
last Thursday [24 February] that the Ames issue should not be 
placed at the top of the Russian-U.S. relations agenda. 
  Kozyrev said he believed that the issue won't set back the 
hopes for a partnership for peace between Russia and the United 
States. The Foreign Ministry also expressed its hope that the 
issue could be settled before the political and diplomatic 
interests of both countries were put in jeopardy. 
  Sources from Russian intelligence agencies here said they 
were bewildered by the dramatizing of the spy issue on the part 
of their American colleagues and the U.S. Government. 
  An official with the Russian intelligence agency said in an 
informal talk that spies from the U.S. are also active on 
Russian territory and hence the Ames issue should be tackled 
within a framework drawn up between the intelligence agencies of 
the two countries. 
  However, press commentators in Moscow are convinced that the 
uproar in the U.S. about the issue will have an adverse effect 
on the future development of the relations between the two 
countries. They believe that the approach now used by the two 
sides to calm down the row will, to some degree, dictate where 
their bilateral relations will head for.

<F P=106> [From the "World News" program] </F>
  [Text] Moscow and Washington have been taking turns 
slinging mud at each other over alleged espionage cases 
recently. And ties between the two big powers are facing a 
rocky period. Lin Shaowen has the details. 
  Moscow said Wednesday [23 February] that it would expose CIA 
agents in Russia in retaliation for accusations by the U.S. that 
an American spy for Russian bought [as heard] secret documents. 
It is the first time that Moscow has responded since the spying 
case came to light this week. Aldrich Ames, the former chief of 
the CIA's counterintelligence network, and his wife were 
arrested in Washington on Monday. They were accused of spying 
for the former Soviet Union and Russia for nine years. The 
Department of Justice said that they had received more than $1.5 
million for selling vital information on CIA operations and 
personnel. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton described the case as very 
serious and ordered an official protest to the Russian 
Government. Some American senators called on the government to 
freeze aid for Russia immediately. Moscow had no reply in the 
beginning. The U.S. demanded that Russia withdraw diplomats who 
were involved in the spying case or America would take the 
action themselves. But Russia would not bow under the pressure 
easily. It has been enjoying the limelight after its successful 
mediation of the Sarejevo crisis. Senior Russian officials said 
that the spy scandal might have been revealed to discredit the 
success of Russian foreign policy in the Balkan region. Russian 
Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said the case was a 
return to the psychology of the Cold War. He said that 
exaggerating the scandal would be harmful to relations between 
the two countries. Russia has recently taken a tougher stance 
on several issues. President Boris Yeltsin publicly criticized 
the West for trying to resolve major international issues 
without involving the Kremlin. Although the American Government 
is uneasy about a stronger Russia, there is not much it can do 
about it. Even a top White House official admitted that many 
vital American interests are tied up in the relationship with 
Russia. Washington has committed $2.5 billion of aid to Russia 
this year to foster its economic reform. And even after the 
espionage case surfaced, President Clinton reaffirmed that 
Washington will continue to pursue its supportive policy toward 
Yeltsin. Russia isn't likely to ignore the U.S. demands 
completely. If it wants to restore its status as a superpower, 
it will have to learn how to play ball according to a few rules. 
The U.S. and Russia were old competitors for several decades. 
In recent years, relations have become a lot warmer. But a lot 
of negotiations are going to be needed this time to keep the 
honeymoon going and the couple away from divorce court. For 
China Radio International, I am Lin Shaowen.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- The organizing 
committee of the 15th World Petroleum Congress was established 
in Beijing today. Premier Li Peng sent a congratulatory letter 
wishing the congress success. 
  The World Petroleum Congress, an international oil 
representative organization, was founded in London, England, in 
1933 and has 40 major members from oil producers and consumers. 
The World Petroleum Congress, which is held every four years, 
has become an important international event that attracts utmost 
attention from petroleum companies worldwide. China won the bid 
to host the 15th congress in March of 1993 and will host the 
grand gathering of worldwide oil industries in Beijing in 
October 1997. 
  In his congratulatory letter, Premier Li Peng said: "The 
World Petroleum Congress is a large-scale and high-level 
international scientific conference with wide-ranging topics and 
great influence. China is happy to host the 15th World Petroleum 
Congress in Beijing. Hosting this congress fully represents the 
achievements of China's petroleum and petrochemical industries 
in developing oil-related science and technology. I believe 
this meeting will strengthen the scientific and cultural 
exchanges and cooperation of world petroleum and petrochemical 
industries, and it will have a significant and profound bearing 
on China's further opening up and promotion of the socialist 
modernization." 
  Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council, attended the 
inaugural meeting and gave an important speech. He said: To 
convene the 15th World Petroleum Congress in Beijing is a 
significant event for both Beijing Municipality and China, 
reflecting that China's petroleum and petrochemical industries 
have reached the world's forefront. The continuous and stable 
development of China's petroleum and petrochemical industries is 
inseparable from acquiring and developing advanced technology. 
The World Petroleum Congress provides us a good opportunity to 
learn from and conduct exchanges with international 
counterparts. Moreover, it will promote further cooperation. He 
hoped that all sides concerned would coordinate well with one 
another and accomplish various preparatory tasks carefully and 
thoroughly to make this congress a success. 
  Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum 
Corporation, will be the chairman of the organizing committee of 
the 15th World Petroleum Congress. Speaking at the meeting, 
Wang Tao; Sheng Huaren, president of the China National 
Petrochemical Corporation; Wang Yan, president of the China 
National Offshore Oil Corporation; and Zhang Baifa, executive 
vice mayor of Beijing Municipality; said they would make 
vigorous efforts to make this congress a success.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Zhang Li (1728 0500): "A New Trend in </F>
U.S.-Russian Relations as Viewed From the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Issue"] 
  [Text] After the end of the Cold War, the United States 
became the only superpower in the world as a result of the 
Soviet disintegration, while Russia needs U.S. aid from due to 
various political and economic factors. But Russia has recently 
indicated to the West that the settlement of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina issue is impossible without Russian 
participation. 
  As a traditional ally of the Serbs on the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
issue, Russia has always objected to armed threats from the West 
against the Serbs. After NATO's announcement of its ultimatum 
against the Serbs, some Russian officials made threats, saying 
that if NATO really carried out air attacks, a crisis would 
break out in the relationship between Russia and the West. 
Worrying about Russia's possible use of its veto in the UN 
Security Council, the United States insisted that NATO's 
ultimatum should conform with the relevant UN resolution. 
  When diplomats from the 16 NATO countries discussed and 
decided the ultimatum, no one thought of notifying NATO's 
decision to Russia. Russian President Yeltsin and Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev were "extremely unhappy" about this. Thus, a 
"crisis" occurred in the relationship between Russia and the 
West. 
  Under such circumstances, German Chancellor Kohl insisted on 
the need to take into account Russian efforts for peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, regardless of U.S. objections. German 
mediation facilitated Russian influence on the Serbs and played 
a major role in preventing NATO from implementing its planned 
air attacks. The U.S. and Russian stand on the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina issue began to change from antagonism to 
cooperation. 
  On 17 February, Serbian leader Karadzic, and Churkin, the 
special Russian envoy on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, reached 
an agreement under which both sides agreed that Russia should 
send peacekeeping troops to Sarajevo, while the Serbs would 
withdraw their heavy weapons from the areas surrounding Sarajevo 
or would let UN troops control these weapons. Thus, the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis began a turn for the better. As 
reported, Russia did not inform the United States before it 
announced its agreement with the Serbs. Despite its 
dissatisfaction over what Russia had done, the United States 
could not but praise in public that Russia had made an 
"important contribution." When the Serbs began to withdraw 
their heavy weapons from the Sarajevo area, on the one hand 
Churkin claimed that the turn for the better in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina situation was due to Russian efforts; on the 
other hand, he continued to criticize the West for threatening 
air attacks, while the United States attributed the change in 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation to NATO's "determination" and 
"leading role" of the United States. 
  In the last few months, the United States and Russia have 
time and again engaged in disputes over major issues. At the 
end of last year, the U.S. Government considered accepting 
former nations of the Warsaw Treaty as NATO members, with the 
exception of the former Soviet Union. This evoked strong 
dissatisfaction in Russia. To alleviate its contradictions with 
Russia, the Clinton administration introduced a transitional 
"peaceful partnership" program. 
  Not long after Clinton's visit to Moscow in January, Russian 
Foreign Minister Kozyrev stressed that Russia would maintain its 
military presence in the Baltic Sea. Obviously, this ran 
counter to the Russian commitment to withdraw its troops from 
the Baltic as soon as possible--a commitment made to Clinton 
while he was in Moscow. For this reason, the United States 
reacted strongly and demanded a Russian explanation. 
  These disputes between the United States and Russia are not 
accidental. The United States has always been wary of 
developments in Russia, and its diplomatic strategy hopes that 
Russia will play a role which corresponds with U.S. intentions. 
Although Russia is experiencing economic difficulties and its 
international position is declining, it is not willing to act as 
a "co-star" in international affairs. This is even more the 
case when something involves its strategic interests.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Roundup": "CPPCC National Committee Promotes </F>
International Exchanges"] 
  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Last year Li 
Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), paid 
official visits to Nepal, India and Pakistan. 
  His visits marked the peak of increasingly active exchanges 
and cooperation between the CPPCC National Committee and 
parliaments and mass organizations in other countries over the 
past year. 
  This is the first time for the chairman of the National 
Committee of the CPPCC, the largest united front organization in 
China, to visit other countries since the founding of New China 
in 1949. 
  During his visits, Chairman Li Ruihuan briefed the leaders 
of 
the three countries and people from all walks of life on China's 
foreign policy, and its multi-party cooperation and political 
consultation system under the leadership of the Chinese 
Communist Party, promoting exchanges and cooperation between the 
CPPCC National Committee and parliaments in the three countries. 
  Public sentiments overseas confirm that Li's visits 
represent 
the CPPCC National Committee's dual role in expanding both 
governmental and non-governmental exchanges in the diplomatic 
area. 
  Established 45 years ago, the CPPCC National Committee 
consists of various non-communist parties and mass organizations 
and is considered a creation for enhancing socialist democracy 
in China. It plays a significant role in political consultation 
and democratic supervision in managing state affairs. 
  International exchanges held by the CPPCC National Committee 
in 1993 were characterized by frequent visits to other countries 
by the committee's leaders. 
  Also in 1993, Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Seypidin Azizi, Hong 
Xuezhi, Hu Sheng and Sun Fuling, vice-chairmen of the CPPCC 
National Committee, paid separate visits to Vietnam, Laos, 
Thailand, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Syria, 
Oman, Qatar and Bahrain. 
  During their talks with the leaders of these countries, 
these 
vice-chairmen reiterated China's consistent stand in support of 
the just cause of the people in developing countries and 
expounded the positions of the Chinese Government concerning the 
international situation and regional conflicts. 
  Furthermore, they also explained to their guests the role of 
the CPPCC organizations in a bid to expand cooperation with 
parliaments and mass organizations in other countries. 
  To date, the CPPCC National Committee has forged cooperative 
relationships with 46 organizations in 36 countries. 
  The committee focuses its international exchanges and 
cooperation on China's economic construction. Various 
subcommittees also try to expand cooperation with economists and 
scientists overseas. 
  For example, while visiting Britain in 1993, members of a 
delegation sent by the subcommittee of science and technology 
concentrated on learning how scientific and technological 
findings were applied to industrial production. 
  Moreover, they discussed with their British colleagues the 
relationship between scientific research and social progress, in 
an effort to draw on useful experience to perfect the policy 
governing the development of science and technology in China. 
  Also in 1993, leaders of the CPPCC National Committee 
received 250 leaders of overseas Chinese organizations in 
Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the 
Philippines and the United States. 
  This year the committee will continue to expand cooperation 
and exchanges with parliaments in other countries. It will also 
organize specialized groups to visit foreign countries.

<F P=106> ["To Safeguard Human Rights or To Practise Hegemonism? -- A </F>
Comment on U.S. Human Rights Report"] 
  [Text] Beijing, February 27 (XINHUA) -- Despite the 
requirements of international law, the U.S. State Department 
annually issues a worldwide report on human rights, to interfere 
in the internal affairs of other countries and practise power 
politics under the excuse of safeguarding human rights. 
  The 1993 worldwide report on human rights issued by the U.S. 
State Department on February 1 again wantonly distorted and 
unreasonably criticized the human rights situation in China and 
some other countries. 
  However, it said nothing about the human rights problems in 
the United States itself. The report was aimed at forcing other 
countries to accept the ideology and value concepts of the 
United States and change their political systems according to 
the U.S. human rights model. As a result, it met with 
opposition from many countries and the mass media. 
  To enjoy extensive and full human rights is the common wish 
of people all over the world, including the Chinese people. For 
this purpose, the Communist Party of China has led the Chinese 
people to strive in a long-term and arduous struggle. 
  The founding of New China put an end to the long and 
miserable history of the Chinese people's being invaded, 
oppressed and humiliated. The Constitution of China stipulates 
that all the rights of the People's Republic of China belong to 
the people. 
  China has taken various measures to guarantee all the rights 
of the people. Nowadays, the human rights situation in China 
has been fundamentally improved. At present, China's political 
situation is stable. Great progress has been made in building 
democracy and the legal system. The economy and all trades are 
prosperous. The people live and work in peace and contentment. 
This is a fact obvious to all. 
  Of course, the human rights situation in China is not 
completely satisfactory. However, the human rights situation in 
China is better than that in the United States in many aspects. 
  The incidence of crimes such as murder, robbery, rape, drug 
abuse, violence and racial discrimination in the United States 
come first on the list every year, costing many lives of the 
American people, thus infringing upon the human rights of the 
American people. 
  According to the statistics made by U.S. officials, about 
one 
million people in the United States are being imprisoned. 
However, merely 1.2 million people are being imprisoned in 
jails and reform- through-labour farms in China. Since China's 
population is 4.5 times that of the United States, the U.S. 
proportion of imprisoned people to the whole population is four 
times that of China. 
  The U.S. Government has admitted that about seven million 
people in the country are homeless and there are two million to 
three million people in the United States sleeping in the open 
all the year round. In China, however, only 150,000 people are 
found sleeping in the open every year. Moreover, the 
departments of civil affairs would make timely arrangements to 
re-settle them. 
  Why is the United States, which has so many serious problems 
of human rights, so enthusiastic to criticize the human rights 
situation in other countries? 
  To put it bluntly, the United States was not really trying 
to 
"safeguard human rights," but to interfere in the internal 
affairs of other countries and trample on international norms 
under the excuse of the human rights problem so as to serve its 
hegemonist policies of foreign affairs. 
  The United States has long posed as a "worldwide judge", 
judging the human rights situation in other countries with its 
own political norms and legal philosophy. It often imposes 
sanctions on countries which do not tally with its norm of human 
rights by integrating human rights with its external aid, 
economic and technological cooperation and most favored nation 
trading status and using these as the means of political 
pressure. 
  It even demands other countries to change their domestic 
policies and political systems, thus severely infringing on the 
sovereignty and dignity of many developing countries. 
  As known to all, the issue of human rights is in essence an 
internal affair of a country. According to international law, 
to respect the state sovereignty and not to interfere in other's 
internal affairs is a conventional principle of international 
law. To negate the principle of sovereignty means to negate the 
foundation stone of the modern international law. 
  As early as December 6, 1946, the General Assembly of the 
United Nations passed the "Draft Declaration on Rights and 
Duties of States," which points out: "Every state has the right 
to independence and hence to exercise freely, without dictation 
by any other state, all its legal powers, including the choice 
of its own form of government," and "every state has the duty to 
refrain from intervention in the internal or external affairs of 
any other state." 
  On December 9, 1981, the U.N. General Assembly adopted 
Resolution No. 36/103, passing again a declaration which points 
out that every state has the duty to avoid utilizing and 
distorting the issue of human rights and using the issue to 
impose pressure on any other state. 
  The human rights report of the U.S. State Department 
violated 
these U.N. declarations. It shows no concern with human rights, 
but practises power politics. 
  While posing as a guardian of human rights and making great 
efforts to carry out the diplomacy of human rights, the United 
States has not joined some important international conventions 
on human rights passed by the U.N. General Assembly. 
  For example, the U.S. Congress has so far not approved the 
United States to sign "The International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination" passed in 
1965, "The International Convention on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights" passed in 1966, "The International Convention 
on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid" 
passed in 1973, and "The Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination Against Women" passed in 1980. 
  Therefore, it is not strange that Professor John Lawrence 
Hargrove, executive vice-president and executive director of the 
American Society of International Law, stated that the U.S. has 
not participated in major international human rights 
conventions, so on what grounds does it concern itself with 
other countries' human rights situations? 
  On the contrary, China has been in advance of the United 
States in ratifying the international conventions on human 
rights. Since the People's Republic of China resumed its seat 
in the United Nations, it has participated in seven of the 
international conventions, including "The Convention on the 
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide," "The 
International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of 
the Crime of Apartheid," "The Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination Against Women," "The Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination," "The 
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees," "The Protocol 
Relating to the Status of Refugees," and "The Convention Against 
Torture and Other Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment." 
  Besides, the Chinese Government has always submitted reports 
about the situation in carrying out the conventions it has 
already participated and always sternly and seriously 
implemented its duties stipulated in the conventions. 
  After the U.S. State Department's human rights report was 
issued, it has met with denunciation by China and many other 
countries. The United States will certainly not succeed in its 
plot of practising power politics and hegemonism under the 
excuse of human rights.

  [Text] Shanghai, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai 
office of the Morgan Stanley group of the United States opened 
today, John Mack, president of the global financial institution, 
announced here. 
  The reason the group has chosen Shanghai for its first 
office 
in China is that the city is becoming China's financial center, 
Mack said at a ceremony to mark the opening of the office. 
  He said, "I am sure that China will play an increasingly 
important role in the global financial market." 
  Therefore, the Chinese market has become the focus of the 
group's operations, he said. The Shanghai office will offer 
consultancy and advice on how to turn Chinese enterprises into 
shareholding companies, he added. 
  According to Mack, the office will also help Chinese 
companies issue shares in the United States and Europe; help 
Chinese securities institutions enter the international market; 
become involved in issuing shares in China's securities markets; 
offer advice on how to raise money for large industrial and 
infrastructural projects in China; and seek opportunities for 
cooperation with Chinese financial institutions. 
  The Morgan Stanley group intends to undertake a large real 
estate project and plans to participate in foreign exchange and 
futures trading in Shanghai, he said. 
  The group is applying to open another office in Beijing, he 
said.

<F P=106> ["Economic notes" by Qian Hong (0578 4767): "Perplexity </F>
With Economic Growth"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Federal Reserve announced on 4 February 
that it would raise short-term interest rates from 3 to 3.25 
percent. The response on the New York Stock Exchange was swift: 
Industrials on the Dow Jones Index fell close to 100 percentage 
points in one day. 
  The American economy finally picked up some growth momentum 
in the third quarter of last year after a languid 32-month 
spell. As if to show it had lain dormant long enough, the 
economy burst into activity in a great release of all the 
frustrated energy pent up over the years. U.S. GDP growth rate 
in the fourth-quarter hit 5.9 percent. Before Christmas, 
factory inventories dropped to a new low for the previous 20 
years; 83.5 percent of industrial plants were operating; and the 
average work-time in the manufacturing sector was the highest 
since World War II. Economists generally agree that when 
industrial plant use reaches 85 percent, manufacturers will 
start to feel the pressure of rising prices due to labor and raw 
material shortages. It was this concern over inflation that 
prompted the recent raising of short-term interest rates. 
  Despite the fact that the Clinton administration's economic 
policy of increasing taxes, reducing expenditure, and cutting 
budget deficits was the main cause of the revival of the 
American economy, interest rates played a more direct role in 
the recent strong growth within a relatively short time. The 
government determination to cut financial deficits reduced 
government borrowing, releasing funds into capital markets. The 
rate of return on the 30-year Treasury bonds -- the cornerstone 
for long-term interest rates -- dropped accordingly, leading to 
a fall in short-term interest rates such as the mortgage rate, 
consumption credit rate, and rates for corporate debentures. 
Interest rate cuts reduced private and corporate debt burdens, 
encouraged car and house purchases, and promoted rapid growth in 
investment, bringing to light the whole manufacturing sector. 
However, private consumption growth in 1993 far exceeded income 
growth. Behind the wave of consumption were worries about 
interest rate hikes. As the American economy is still in the 
grip of the borrowing-consumption pattern, there is always a 
chance that the interest rate will be raised again. This lends 
a certain short-term and fleeting character to the current 
interest rate-powered economic growth. 
  This is not the whole story of the dilemma for American 
economic growth. As most Western countries are still in 
recession, demand in the growing American economy has risen, 
while demand in its overseas markets remains sluggish. This may 
help ease shortages on raw material markets and inflation 
pressure, but it may also increase the U.S. trade deficit and 
sag the momentum of economic growth. 
  Amid general recession among Western countries, economic 
growth in East Asia and Latin America has injected new vitality 
into the world economy. Moreover, economic growth in these 
countries is no longer one based on borrowings. Now they 
sustain their economic growth more with savings and direct 
investment and spend no more than they earn. With low labor 
cost and effective participation in the world economy, an 
increasingly larger number of technology- and labor-intensive 
products from Asian countries and regions are becoming not only 
self-sufficient, but also gaining a position in international 
markets. Their purchases from Western countries of high 
value-added capital goods are determined by their balance of 
trade. In this sense, they appear first as producers, then as 
consumers on the international market. 
  The year 1993 was a year of intense restructuring for 
American corporations. To position themselves for competition, 
firms spent their funds on information equipment which reduced 
manpower and cut again intermediate-level management staff and 
labor. The restructuring, therefore, was focusing on lowering 
product cost instead of increasing employment opportunity. 
Numerous white-collar workers became unemployed at a time of 
economic revival, and newly created jobs were mostly odd or 
part-time jobs. Reductions in high- paying and stable 
employment greatly restricted consumption power in society, thus 
weakening the dynamics of American economic development. 
  Owing to these factors, the American economy in 1994 may 
very 
likely find itself in a state of low-speed growth, its annual 
economic growth rate estimated at around 3 percent. In a world 
economic system which is increasingly integrated, the American 
economy will have to wait for the revival of the Western economy 
and economic development of developing countries for effective 
growth. Meanwhile, more and more countries are entering market 
competition. Whoever wants to have a lot of room for maneuvering 
and the luxury to advance and retreat as he wishes must acquire 
an advantage in high technology or cost cutting. To stay 
competitive in the international market, American firms will 
have to be further internationalized, work harder to be more 
responsive, and cut costs. Returns on the scale of economy are 
lowering, and medium and small firms can look for long-term 
development. But Americans should not expect any rise in their 
income level, which is high enough for now. This is an 
adjustment process wrought with pain.

a very important sphere of Sino-Japanese trade and economic 
cooperation." 
  Zhu Rongji said: There are 108 Japanese banking institutions 
in China. Both China and Japan are Oriental countries. They 
share very profound cultural origins. China used Japan's 
experiences for reference in carrying out banking reform. Zhu 
Rongji also briefed Yasushi Mieno on China's banking reform. 
  The Japan Association for the Promotion of International 
Trade [JAPIT] and the Japan-China Economic Association [JCEA] 
jointly hosted a reception at the Shinotani Hotel in Tokyo at 
noon today to extend a warm welcome to Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
and his party. About 1,000 people, including figures from 
Japan's various circles and representatives of Overseas Chinese 
in Japan, attended the reception. 
  JAPIT President Yoshio Sakurauchi, JCEA President Ryoichi 
Kawai, and Hiroshi Kumagai, Japanese international trade and 
industry minister, separately addressed the reception and 
expressed their hope that Japanese-Chinese trade and economic 
cooperation will enjoy continuous development. 
  Zhu Rongji delivered a speech at the reception and expressed 
his thanks to Japanese friends in various circles for their warm 
hospitality.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji said here today the ongoing reform in China will push 
forward bilateral cooperation between Tokyo and Beijing, Chinese 
Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Zhu said China and Japan have gained "a historical 
opportunity" to further develop ties as China is now striving 
for a shift to market economy from the traditional planed 
economy, the officials said. 
  He made the remarks when he was lunching with Yoshio 
Sakurauchi, head of the Japanese Association for the Promotion 
of International Trade. 
  The vice premier spoke highly of the association for having 
made "precious contributions" to the strengthening of Japan's 
trade and economic ties with China, they said. 
  In a separate meeting, Zhu briefed a group of leading 
Japanese bankers on the current economic situation in China and 
its reforms on finance and taxation. 
  In the evening, he dined with leaders from six organizations 
for Japan-China friendship and called on them to continue their 
efforts to help solidify bilateral relations, the officials said. 
  Earlier in the day, he met Japan's International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, State Minister for Economic 
Planning Manae Kubota and former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The exchange rate of 
the Chinese renminbi against the U.S. dollar has been stable 
since last July despite the recent unification of China's 
dual-track foreign exchange system, Chinese Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji said here today. 
  Speaking at a press conference at the Japan National Press 
Club in Tokyo, Zhu added: "I hope the renminbi will be stable 
in the future, too." 
  Currently, one dollar is exchanged for about 8.70 yuan on 
the 
Chinese inter-bank foreign exchange market. 
  The new unification and controlled floating exchange-rate 
system, based on market supply and demand, was introduced on 
January 1. 
  Zhu said China unified the system in an effort to pave the 
way for its re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT). 
  "So far the reform of foreign exchange rates has been 
successful and China would eventually make the renminbi a hard 
currency that is exchangeable internationally," Zhu added. 
  The vice premier arrived in Japan Wednesday [23 February] 
for 
a nine-day official visit. He is expected to leave for western 
and southwestern Japan Saturday.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji reiterated today that China will not change 
the system in Hong Kong after 1997 when Beijing restores its 
jurisdiction over the British colony. 
  "Hong Kong will be a special administrative zone after 1997 
with special laws," Zhu told a news conference at the Japan 
National Press Club. "Therefore, there will be no change in its 
system." 
  He said the Chinese Government will continue to protect the 
interests of foreign-funded firms there and work hard to make a 
more prosperous Hong Kong. 
  Zhu, who arrived here Wednesday [23 February] for a nine-day 
visit, lashed out at the so-called "flexible diplomacy" pursued 
by Taiwan, apparently referring to the recent visit to Southeast 
Asian nations by Taiwanese "President" Lee [Li] Teng-hui. 
  He said his government had lodged protests with the 
Southeast 
Asian nations -- Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand -- over 
the issue. 
  On Japan's ties with Taiwan, the vice premier said he 
believes that Tokyo "will not hurt the feelings of the Chinese 
people."

  [Text] Tokyo, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- While attending a speaking 
forum jointly organized by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN, and the Japan Association for the Promotion of 
International Trade today, Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
delivered an important speech on three main topics of wide 
interest in Japan -- a review of China's economic development in 
1993, conditions for the reform of the economic structure in 
1994, and prospects for Sino-Japanese economic and technical 
cooperation -- and answered questions raised by attendees. 
  Zhu Rongji said: The just-concluded year of 1993 was a year 
during which China achieved brilliant successes in reform and 
opening up, as well as in its modernization drive. For the past 
dozen years or so, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we have 
succeeded in exploring an effective way for both reform and 
development while maintaining social and political stability 
amid tremendous changes in both the economic system and the 
social structure. China will firmly proceed along the road of 
establishing a socialist market economic system. 
  Touching on the conditions of China's economic development 
in 
1993, Zhu Rongji said: China has entered a new phase of rapid 
economic development since 1992 with an annual growth rate 
reaching 13 percent for two straight years. Under conditions of 
a sustained, high growth-rate economy, some issues worth paying 
attention to did arise, primarily including overinvestment in 
capital construction, the irrational investment structure, 
heated development in real estate and development zones, and 
aggravated "bottleneck restraints" on economic development 
originating in the communications and energy sectors. To 
guarantee sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development, we 
introduced in June last year a series of timely measures to 
strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control 
which have swiftly turned around the situation and helped 
preserve the favorable trend of economic development. Zhu 
Rongji pointed out: When we strengthened macroregulatory 
control, we did not seek all-round retrenchment. Rather, this 
was aimed at readjusting -- through the correct enforcement of 
the monetary policy and the rectification of the financial order 
-- the investment orientation and structure according to 
industrial policy and market demands, in an effort to channel 
funds to such fields as agriculture, communications, and energy 
to aid the development of the national economy. The enforcement 
has resulted in maintaining rapid economic growth, preventing 
the excessive circulation of money, and bringing inflation under 
control. 
  Zhu Rongji said: We must be moderate in all our endeavors. 
In a country such as China with a population of more than 1.1 
billion people, it is particularly necessary to avert both sharp 
rises and sharp drops in the economy. The dynamics of 
macroregulatory control and a tight- or loose-money situation 
will all depend on our national conditions and the realities of 
economic development. Facts have proved that we have been 
successful in doing things this way. 
  Zhu Rongji emphasized: Although the ongoing macroregulatory 
control has achieved results, the effects of a permanent cure 
lie in the continued deepening of reform and the establishment 
of a socialist market economic system -- a direction decided by 
the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 
  Turning to the question of this year's reform, Zhu Rongji 
said: After long-term preparations, the Chinese Government this 
year has introduced reform measures for finance and taxation, 
banking, investment, foreign trade, and enterprise mechanisms 
that served as major preparations for the establishment of a 
socialist market economic system. These reform measures were 
formulated under the guidance of the party's central leadership 
with General Secretary Jiang Zemin as its core, with the 
concerted wisdom of the people across the nation, and by drawing 
on the successful experiences of the developed countries. 
Judging from the conditions of enforcement over the past 50 
days, the overall situation has been fine and without the 
emergence of major problems. The current market and social 
stability and popular feeling among the people have reinforced 
our determination to push forward reform right up to the finish. 
Zhu Rongji pointed out: The aforementioned reform measures 
will basically take shape this year with more people getting 
familiar with them next year; and by the year 1996, China will 
begin entering the track of a socialist market economy. 
  Zhu Rongji emphasized: In promoting reform, China will 
fully look after the interests of foreign investors, and its 
implementation will further improve investment environments in 
China. With the objective of realizing the principle of 
standardized, uniform, and fair competition, the ongoing tax 
reform has not increased the burdens of foreign-funded 
enterprises, and we will take compensatory measures for 
individual foreign-funded enterprises that may have been 
affected by it. All preferential policies toward foreign-funded 
enterprises will remain unchanged. 
  Touching on Sino-Japanese economic relations, Zhu Rongji 
indicated: The development of Sino-Japanese economic relations 
has been fine, and it was particularly so last year when the 
bilateral trade volume reached $39 billion, a 54-percent 
increase over 1992. Japan has become China's largest trading 
partner, with China becoming Japan's second largest. 
Simultaneously, Japan is also China's largest trading partner 
for technology, with Japanese investment topping other 
foreign-funded enterprises in terms of paid-up capital. 
However, when compared to the potential for Sino-Japanese 
economic cooperation and the potential of the Chinese market, 
this $39 billion was too small a figure. We should make joint 
efforts to broaden the extent of economic cooperation between 
the two countries, which will be significant to the development 
of both nations. To spur an economic recovery, Japan has 
formulated measures to stimulate its economy; the opening up of 
overseas markets, particular the Chinese market, will have an 
important role in revitalizing the Japanese economy. Citing the 
successful, practical example of all-round cooperation between 
Japan's Matsushita Electrical Company and a Chinese enterprise 
in producing video cameras, Zhu Rongji expressed the hope that 
friends in Japanese economic circles will make unremitting 
efforts to promote friendly and cooperative economic relations 
between the two countries. 
  Because of limited accommodations, out of some 2,700 people 
from all walks of life in Japan who expressed an interest in 
hearing Vice Premier Zhu's speech today, only a few more than 
900 were able to attend the function. The speaking forum was 
filled with a friendly and warm atmosphere, during which Zhu 
Rongji also made impromptu replies to questions asked by 
attendees. His speech many times resulted in warm applause.

  [Text] Tokyo, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- Persons in charge of six 
organizations, including the Japan-China Friendship Association, 
the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, the Japanese 
Association for the Promotion of International Trade, the 
Japan-China Friendship and Parliamentarians Union, the 
Japan-China Association of the Economy and Trade, and the 
Japan-China Society, held a dinner party at the Shinotani Hotel 
in Tokyo this evening to give a warm welcome to Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji and his party. 
  At the dinner party, Zhu Rongji thanked the friends from the 
six friendly Japan-China organizations for their valuable 
contributions to Sino-Japanese friendship over the past decades. 
He said that the Chinese people would never forget this. Zhu 
Rongji expressed the hope that the six organizations would make 
new contributions to Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation. 
  At 1200, Zhu Rongji attended the celebration marking the 
40th 
founding anniversary of the Japanese Association for the 
Promotion of International Trade. Zhu Rongji stressed at the 
celebration: The current situation has offered both China and 
Japan a historic opportunity for further developing their 
friendship and cooperation. China's economic development and her 
success in the building of a market economy will surely push 
Sino-Japanese cooperation to a new level. He encouraged both 
old and new friends in the Japanese Association for the 
Promotion of International Trade to make unremitting efforts 
with their Chinese counterparts for this purpose. 
  This afternoon, Zhu Rongji met Masashi Okuda, president of 
the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, and persons in 
charge of some big Japanese banks at the Shinotani Hotel in 
Tokyo, where he stayed during the visit. Zhu Rongji briefed 
them on China's reform of the banking, financial, and taxation 
systems and answered their questions. 
  Also in the afternoon, Zhu Rongji met separately with 
Japan's 
Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister, and 
Manae Kubota, Economic Planning Agency director general, to 
exchange opinions on issues such as further developing 
Sino-Japanese trade and economic cooperation as well as the 
exchange of experience and information. 
  At noon, Zhu Rongji met with Michio Watanabe, Japan's former 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister. In the morning, Zhu 
Rongji also attended a breakfast held in his honor by Japan's 
Mitsubishi group. Following the breakfast, he met with persons 
in charge of the Sankin Kai [san jin hui -- 0005 6855 2585] (the 
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Ltd.) and its subsidiary companies.

  [Text] Tokyo, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- This morning Zhu Rongji, 
vice premier of China's State Council, was invited to attend a 
breakfast hosted by Japan's Mitsui group in his honor. 
  Zhu Rongji said: You all are old friends of the Chinese 
people and well-established Japanese entrepreneurs. I can tell 
you that China's economic reform is bound to succeed, and China 
will maintain its annual economic growth rate at 8 to 9 percent 
for a long time to come. You should have full confidence in it. 
  Zhu Rongji added emphatically: Favorable temporal, 
geographical, human, and other factors bind China and Japan 
closely together. Friendly relations and cooperation between 
China and Japan are an irresistible historical trend. China 
needs Japan's capital and technology for its development, 
whereas Japan needs China's markets and resources for its 
economic development. Only by increasing cooperation can China 
and Japan achieve their own prosperity. In conducting equal and 
mutually beneficial cooperation, China and Japan should show 
mutual understanding, consult with each other in a friendly 
manner, and solve existing problems. 
  Zhu Rongji expressed the hope that Japan's economic circles 
would consider the overall interest in developing Sino-Japanese 
cooperation and work with China in constantly advancing 
good-neighbor and friendly relations between China and Japan. 
His speech won warm applause from those present at the 
breakfast. 
  Prominent Japanese entrepreneurs attending the breakfast 
included Naohiko Kumagaya, president of Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd.; 
Yosuo Matsushita, president of Sakura Bank; Joichi Aoi, 
president of Toshiba Corporation; Katsunosuke Maeda, president 
of Toray Industries; and Yoshiro Sasaki, vice president of 
Nippon Steel Corporation. They related their experiences in 
developing economic relations and trade with China, spoke highly 
of China's achievements in economic reform, and repeatedly 
expressed their wish to vigorously promote cooperation with 
China. 
  He Chunlin, deputy secretary general of the State Council, 
and other key aides attended the breakfast.

  [Text] Hu Jintao, standing committee member of CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau, said yesterday that the CPC hopes to 
promote party exchanges with the Japan New Party [JNP] and 
mutual understanding. He made the remark while meeting a 
visiting JNP delegation led by House of Representative member 
Banri Kaieda yesterday. 
  Speaking to the delegation, Standing Committee member Hu 
Jintao said that, in the 21 years since the normalization of 
diplomatic relations between China and Japan, friendly 
cooperative relations between the two countries had been 
improved in various areas, and the two countries were entering a 
new stage which would allow for a further improvement in 
bilateral relations. He added that, as China maintained its 
policy of attaching importance to improving friendly relations 
with Japan, it intended to keep those relations going from 
generation to generation by deepening exchanges with the JNP, 
the ruling parties, and opposition parties, and by promoting 
mutual understanding. 
  In response, Mr. Banri Kaieda handed over a letter from 
Prime 
Minister Hosokawa addressed to President Jiang Zemin and 
indicated the JNP was committed to further improving relations 
between Japan and China.

  [Text] Beijing, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Nongovernmental 
organizations in China and Japan should make joint efforts for 
environmental undertakings, according to a signed article in 
today's "PEOPLE'S DAILY." 
  The article, authored by Sun Pinghua, former deputy 
secretary 
general of the China-Japan Friendship Association, points out 
that some Japanese non-governmental organizations have been 
enthusiastic about China's efforts at afforestation, sand 
control and improving rural living conditions. 
  China now has more than 66.7 million ha of barren hills and 
swamps waiting to be greened, and every year large areas of land 
are engulfed by sand or threatened by flood, drought, hail or 
mud-rock flows. 
  Without well-planned, long-term and consistent efforts to 
improve the environment, China's climate will be affected, as 
will the climate of China's neighbor, Japan, Sun states. 
  Since its establishment in 1984, the Green China Fund has 
been making efforts to enhance domestic afforestation and 
international cooperation. 
  Sun says he hopes that Japanese afforestation organizations 
can have more contacts with the fund so that Japanese friends 
will be able to support China's greening activities. 
  The cooperation also requires government involvement, 
according to Sun. The increased acid rain over Japan have 
catched [as received] a growing public attention. Some Japanese 
questioned if it was the result of the untreated coal burning of 
the Chinese factories. 
  "To reach the conclusion, proof based on scientific 
researches is needed," Sun noted, adding that this also calls 
for the cooperation of both sides. 
  During the past few years academic seminars have been held 
between Japanese and Chinese scholars. However, few of them 
were related to greening and environmental problems.

  The four points should be implemented simultaneously, Ho 
stressed.

  [Text] Vienna, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Inspectors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency were granted today visas to 
visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), 
according to a news bulletin released by the agency. 
  The bulletin said the group of inspectors were scheduled to 
arrive in Pyongyang on March 1, and then visit seven nuclear 
facilities in the country. 
  DPRK agreed on February 15 to open the seven nuclear 
facilities, but said two other facilities were not included. 
  The U.N. agency urged DPRK on February 23 to grant visas to 
the inspectors as soon as possible and set a one-week deadline. 
  In a related development, the United States agreed to cancel 
joint military exercises this year with South Korea and to begin 
the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks on March 21 in Geneva. 
  The two sides also agreed that the working-level contacts 
between the North and South should resume in Panmunjom.

  [Text] Seoul, February 28 (XINHUA) -- South Korea today 
proposed to hold a fourth contact meeting with the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to discuss the exchange of 
special envoys between them. 
  South Korea said the exchange of special envoys is designed 
to seek a peaceful settlement of the nuclear dispute through 
dialogue and to pave way for improving the South-North relations. 
  The proposal was made by South Korean vice minister of 
national unification and chief delegate of the South in 
inter-korean talks, Song Yong-tae, in a telephone message to his 
DPRK counterpart, Pak Yong-su. 
  Song proposed that the meeting begin from 10 a.m. March 1 at 
the "House of Peace" on the southern side of the Panmunjom 
military demarcation line. 
  He hoped that both sides could reach an agreement as soon as 
possible on the exchange of envoys. 
  The DPRK agreed to begin a new round of dialogue with South 
Korea in its talks in New York with the United States on 
February 26, on the condition that South Korea proposes it first. 
  The two sides have held three rounds of talks on the 
exchange 
of envoys but failed to reach agreement owing to their 
differences over the timing of the exchange, the envoys' 
responsibility, and the agenda. 
  The last meeting was held on October 25 last year on the 
northern side of the Panmunjom demarcation line.

  [Text] President Ramos yesterday appointed Development 
Bank of the Philippines (DBP) Chairman Roberto de Ocampo as 
acting finance secretary replacing Ernest Leung effective 1 
February 1994. Ocampo's designation to the powerful finance 
portfolio has been floated around for quite sometime. 
Apparently, Malacanang has received favorable feedbacks on him, 
especially from the business community. 
  The finance post was vacated in May 1993 when the nomination 
of then Finance Secretary Ramon del Rosario Jr. was rejected by 
the Commission on Appointments [CA]. Leung, a competent 
technical man who shuns publicly, was not keen on being named 
the permanent finance secretary, a Malacanang source said. 
  Leung has been an old hand in the finance department having 
served as assistant finance secretary during the Aquino 
administration. 
  President Ramos scouted for candidates for the finance 
portfolio from the private sector. But his efforts were 
unsuccessful because of the sad fate of Del Rosario at the hands 
of the CA. 
  The president appointed Leung to two important positions -- 
as president of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(PDIC) and chairman of the Central Bank board of liquidators 
effective 1 February 1994. 
  The Board of Liquidators has the task of disposing of the 
assets and liabilities of the old Central Bank. The president 
also designated DBP Vice Chairman Alfredo Antonio as officer in 
charge of the DBP, effective 1 February, said Ocampo.

<F P=106> [By Isidoro S. Chammag] </F>
  [Text] Bontoc, Mt. Province -- Now it can be told. 
  The reason of former rebel priest Conrado Balweg for leaving 
in haste the New People's Army (NPA) group operating in Central 
Cordillera early 1986 was that he was about to be liquidated by 
his fellow rebels for acts inimical to the Communist Party of 
the Philippines (CPP). 
  This was disclosed last week by old man Mario Yag-ao, a 
native of Tinglayan, Kalinga-Apayao, during a dialogue here with 
PNP [Philippine National Police] officers. 
  Yag-ao, who was the first president of the Cordillera Bodong 
Association (CBA), an organization of tribal peace pact holders 
in Kalinga and Mountain Province which was organized by the 
Cordillera People's Alliance (CPA), arrived here with other 
Tinglayan tribal leaders to witness the surrender to the PNP of 
19 M16 rifles by CPLA [Cordillera People's Liberation Army] men 
belonging to Jimmy Sawatang's Group. 
  "Balweg committed some misgivings against the NPA movement 
and was about to be executed when he was rescued by other former 
NPA rebels and was crowned as CPLA chief on the basis of his 
being a Roman Catholic priest," Yag-ao said. 
  It was gathered from another source that during a conference 
of NPA leaders, one Ignacio Capegsan, alias "Bill Bileg," then a 
top NPA officer, reportedly slapped Balweg in the presence of 
other CPP-NPA [Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's 
Army] members for his allegedly grievous mistakes and 
insincerity. 
  Capegsan was arrested by intelligence operatives at the 
Manila International Airport in mid-1980s. 
  Balweg, through the media was later reported to have formed 
and led the CPLA, a supposedly breakaway group of the NPA. 
  However, Mailed Molina, a former NPA officer who is now an 
elected municipal mayor of Bucloc, Abra, said in a recent 
interview that he and other former NPA comrades -- not Balweg -- 
organized the CPLA. 
  Yag-ao said that Balweg showed his untrustworthiness when he 
started committing violations by deciding on matters without the 
consent of the majority of tribal leaders. 
  The Tinglayan tribal leaders denounced Balweg for virtually 
neglecting the CPLA-CBA [Cordillera People's Liberation 
Army-Cordillera Bodong Association] by concentrating on his 
treasure-hunting activities and for not accounting for the 
finances of the two organizations. 
  It was for this reason that most of the CPLA-CBA members 
broke away, leaving Balweg with less than 50 followers in the 
entire Cordilleras. 
  Meanwhile, PNP officials of the Cordillera Regional Command 
(Crecom) at Camp Dangwa, La Trinidad, Benguet also denounced 
Balweg for his continued refusal to surrender the firearms 
issued to his group. 
  Lt. Col. Rey Jucutan, spokesman for PNP-Crecom, said that 
Balweg had been issued more than 120 high-powered firearms by 
the government since the peace conference held at Mount Data, 
Mountain Province. 
  "We are puzzled by the continuous insincerity of Father 
Balweg. If his group continue to refuse to heed our pleadings, 
the full force of the law will have to be applied," he said.

  [Text] The Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] will 
respect the authority of officials of the Autonomous Region in 
Muslim Mindanao [ARMM]. This was the assurance given by MNLF 
Chairman Nur Misuari to Senator Santanina Rasul during their 
dialogue earlier. 
  The apprehension that the term of office of ARMM officials 
would be affected stemmed from Misuari's call for the 
establishment of a provisional government in Mindanao. ARMM 
officials, headed by the regional governor, have a three-year 
term of office.

  [Text] The United States has postponed until early next 
month the decision about Thailand's status on its Priority Watch 
List, or PWL, because an assistant of the U.S. Trade 
Representative will arrive here first to observe Thailand's 
handling of piracy against intellectual property rights [IPR] 
and its copyright law. Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon told 
newsmen that it is good that the U.S. official will make an 
on-the-spot observation to see that Thailand is serious about 
suppression of intellectual property right violations and has 
adjusted its copyright law, making it closer to the 
international standard in order to benefit international trade. 
  [Begin Uthai recording, in progress] ...who will inspect 
trade related to the issue of copyrights or intellectual 
property rights here. In my opinion, this is good because he 
will see with his own eyes and then be able to use that 
information as criteria for the U.S. decision. Regarding the 
decision to be made in January, the United States has informed 
us that it will first send an official to make an assessment of 
the situation. A decision will be made after that. I thanked 
them. This is good because they will be able to see for 
themselves what is going on here. They will be able to see that 
we are serious about solving the problem. We realize that the 
measures taken will also benefit our trade. If our own people 
do their business properly, this will be an incentive for others 
to come here and do business with us. We only stand to lose if 
we think only of copying others' products. By so doing we are 
only blocking the chances of new products and new technologies 
arriving in our country. By copying products we have also 
deprived ourselves of the chance to allow new products and new 
techniques to gain access here; moreover, we have deprived 
ourselves of the use of high quality products because their 
owners are afraid of imitation here. This is a disadvantage 
which only a few of us realize. [End recording]

  [Text] No deal has yet been concluded between South Korea 
and Thailand for the purchase of an unspecified number of 
second-hand American-made F-5 Tiger jet fighters, Royal Thai Air 
Force [RTAF] Secretary VM [Vice Marshal] Nan Sasanan said 
yesterday. 
  South Korea has offered to sell Thailand F-5s jet-fighters 
reportedly for one million to 1.5 million dollars each, but the 
RTAF has yet to enter into discussions on the proposed deal, the 
RTAF secretary said. 
  South Korea has also offered to provide spare parts for 
their 
combat aircraft, he said, but Assistant Air Force 
Commander-in-Chief ACM [Air Chief Marshal] Samat Sotsathit and 
Air Force Chief-of-Staff ACM Kriangkrai Sinthawanon are yet to 
respond to the offer. 
  RTAF Secretary VM Nan dismissed a report by South Korea's 
CHOSON ILBO newspaper that the F-5 deal between Thailand and 
South Korea was being negotiated with US approval. 
  The South Korean newspaper quoted a South Korean Defence 
Ministry spokesman as saying that both sides were in the process 
of finalizing the deal and were discussing how many aircraft to 
sell, the price and other details. 
  Thailand will buy about 10 F-5A Tiger jet-fighters and F-5B 
Phantom jet-fighters, the newspaper said. 
  House Armed Services Committee Chairman Gen Athit Kamlang-ek 
earlier in the week expressed support for the reported sale of 
the F-5s, saying they would be reliable, maintainable and 
cost-effective. 
  The Royal Thai Air Force has repair and maintenance crews 
for 
the F-5 which Thailand also has in commission, he said. 
  In other developments VM Nan disclosed that 36 Czech-made 
L-39 trainer/combat aircraft will be deployed well before 
schedule at Air Wing 1 in Nakhon Ratchasima and Air Wing 4 in 
Nakhon Sawan, beginning this month. 
  The first batch of four two-seat L-39s were delivered to Air 
Wing 1 in October last year, roughly three months before 
schedule. 
  The Royal Thai Air Force secretary said Air Wing 1 would 
deploy 22 of the Czech combat aircraft and Air Wing 4 would 
deploy 14. 
  The Royal Thai Air Force and Cathay Pacific, meanwhile, are 
discussing damage compensation that the Hong Kong-based airline 
will pay for unlawfully making a short-cut flight over Thai 
airspace earlier this month, VM Nan said. 
  The short-cut route prompted F-16 Fighting Falcon 
jet-fighters from Air Wing 1 to intercept the commercial 
airliner on January 8. 
  The normal route for commercial airliners is Surat Thani--U- 
Taphao--Bangkok--Nakhon Ratchasima--Laos. 
  But the Cathay Pacific plane made a short cut by not passing 
over Bangkok and flying straight from U-Taphao to Nakhon 
Ratchasima to save fuel. 
  This kind of breach in airspace regulations has not taken 
place very often in Thailand, he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Case for Foreign Businessmen in Cambodia"] </F>
  [Text] Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh's 
move to gag Funcinpec [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] ministers from 
commenting on a dispute between a foreign company and a group of 
local traders seems to have succeeded in quieting the 
controversy for the time being. But sooner or later the premier 
is going to have to take action to resolve the case which has 
stirred the nationalistic fervor of Cambodians and scared 
foreign investors. 
  The dispute centers around Thai Bun Rung, a Hong Kong based- 
company which has been portrayed as a-Thai concern and was 
awarded a 15 year contract by the former Phnom Penh-based regime 
to renovate the state owned Olympic Market. Vendors who used to 
operate at the market for nominal fees have expressed outrage at 
the company's demands for rents that run from $400 a year to 
several thousand dollars. To press their demands, the vendors 
have staged noisy demonstrations in the capital Phnom Penh and 
have won varying levels of support from Finance Minister Sam 
Rangsi and King Norodom Sihanouk. 
  The row also has far reaching political implications and 
threatens to further strain relations between the two largest 
coalition government partners, Ranariddh's Funcinpec Party and 
the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), which has been a large 
beneficiary of company owner Teng Bunma. 
  Ranariddh himself has also been touched by Teng Bunma's 
largess and was the recipient of a $1.5 million airplane last 
year. The gift has raised eyebrows and questions over 
Ranariddh's motives in seeking to quell the protests. 
  But with the political temperature rising to dangerously 
high 
levels, action was needed to cool down tempers and restore the 
confidence of both existing foreign investors or the potential 
ones, who are vital to the development of this economic 
backwater. 
  By attacking the Thai Bun Rung consortium and many other 
existing foreign companies over dubious deals that were struck 
with the CPP, and pressing for the revision to their contracts, 
the Funcinpec side of the government is capitalizing on 
nationalist sentiment to enhance its popularity. At least one 
of three protests against Thai Bun Rung was believed to have 
been engineered by a Funcinpec minister. 
  However, this political strategy which effectively sent the 
party to victory against the rival CPP in the UN-supervised 
elections last May will this time work against Funcinpec and 
consequently the government's stability if it is allowed to 
continue. There is good reason to believe that there is 
something in the coup rumours which began circulating less than 
a month after the coalition government assumed office in August. 
  It is true some of the foreign businessmen in Cambodia have 
behaved like "cowboys" who came to unscrupulously exploit the 
Farwest and need to be replaced by good investors as Finance 
Minister Sam Rangsi recently advocated. 
  But sadly, they are also the only things holding together 
Cambodia's fragile economy at this stage. In a worse case 
scenario, what will happen if they all abruptly withdraw their 
business from Cambodia? Funcinpec ministers are playing a 
dangerous game by attacking foreign businessmen while the 
country desperately needs investment in all the economic sectors. 
  Like it or not, Ranariddh was right when he said in a 
television broadcast on Sunday to try to resolve the Thai Bun 
Rung case: 
  "We can seek popularity after three or four years when the 
next election comes but popularity is not the issue. The issue 
is to help the people by providing medicine, food, and schools." 
  And whether or not Ranariddh was being pressured by the CPP 
leaders who fear they may lose the ill-gotten gains they are 
alleged to have amassed, it is the entire government's 
responsibility to tackle this troublesome issue in a frank and 
fair manner. Such talks are necessary to instill a habit of 
working together and a test of their sincerity to the world and 
the nation. 
  The trade dispute brought to the simmering conflicts between 
members of the two coalition partners. Moreover, it 
demonstrated there was also a level of conflict within Funcinpec 
itself. 
  At this delicate stage, the government should be expanding 
its energy on securing unity within and working together towards 
establishing a conducive environment to attract "good investors". 
  Once economic development has been assured with strong and 
sound investment, the selfish businessmen can be wiped out.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
and his delegation on 25 January arrived at the Santiago 
airport, the Republic of Chile, for an official visit. The 
group was welcomed on their arrival in Chile by Acting Foreign 
Minister (Rodrigo Diaz Aboligo). On 26 January, the foreign 
minister and his party had a meeting with the Chilean acting 
foreign minister and delegation. The outcome of the talks is as 
follows: 
  1. Both sides agreed to expand bilateral relations in 
politics, economics, and especially trade and investment 
cooperation. 
  2. Chile is pleased with the Thai Government's decision 
to open an embassy in Santiago, with the first ambassador 
capable of speaking Spanish. The opening of an embassy will 
mark a new page in relations between the two countries. Chile 
is thankful for Thailand's support for Chile joining as member 
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] grouping. 
  3. Thailand proposed that Chile serve as a gateway for 
trade relations with South America, while Thailand can be a 
gateway for trade in Southeast Asia and Indochinese countries. 
  4. Thailand stressed its policy of friendship with all 
countries regardless of differences in political or economic 
systems, and its principal policy of cooperation within the 
ASEAN bloc, which extends to cover those in the APEC grouping. 
  5. Both sides agreed to exchange business, trade, and 
investment information under a bilateral and multilateral 
framework. Under the bilateral framework, Thailand proposed 
that meetings of senior officials of both countries be held 
regularly, with the exception of the third meeting of the joint 
trade commission which is based on the results of contacts made 
between the chambers of commerce and the banks of both countries. 
  6. Both sides exchanged views on major world events, such 
as the restructuring of the UN Security Council and the summit 
on social development with a view to achieving international 
cooperation and coordination in the same direction. 
  On 26 January, the foreign minister paid a courtesy call on 
President Patricio Aylwin Azocar of Chile. The Chilean 
president offered him a warm welcome, and thanked Thailand for 
supporting Chile becoming a member of APEC. He congratulated 
Thailand's move to open an embassy in Santiago. The foreign 
minister and his party also called on acting ministers of 
economic and energy affairs, as well as those in charge of the 
Foreign Ministry in the new Government of Chile. They exchanged 
views and discussed efforts of the two countries to promote 
trade ties. The two sides welcome Chile's membership in APEC 
and the opening of the Thai Embassy this year. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Recent news on the alleged abuse of Thai 
prisoners in a Laos jail is worrying for two reasons. Firstly, 
there is the concern on a personal, humanitarian level for the 
welfare of approximately 100 Thai prisoners. Secondly, there is 
the worry about what the story, if substantiated, could do for 
Thai-Lao relations at this crucial juncture. 
  According to a former Thai prisoner who was held for a short 
period in the Pakse jail in Champassak in Laos, as many as 100 
Thai prisoners have died due to cruelty and neglect. The man 
talked of the inhumane conditions and treatment the Thais face 
at the hands of their Lao captors. The former prisoner accused 
the Laotian authorities of chaining the Thai prisoners up and of 
providing only poor food each day. 
  Humanitarian concerns aside, this type of news does little 
to 
help the relationship between Thailand and Laos at this 
important time. [passage omitted] 
  Yet under the surface many of the old animosities remain. 
Racism, in terms of the relationship between Thai and ethnic 
Lao, is still a problem in both countries. This is aside from 
the clash between the Marxist ideology pursued by the government 
in Vientiane and the democratic and free market ideals of 
Bangkok. 
  The niggling animosities are partly a product of struggle 
and 
competition over the centuries, and partly due to a dislike of 
people considered outsiders. 
  Many people in government and private circles in Laos fear 
being swamped by everything Thai. Not only are Thai companies 
and businessmen making major inroads into Laos with their 
products and services, but Thai culture as a whole, brought by 
the mass media, is being lapped up by many Laotian people who 
have televisions, radios and cassette recorders. Modern Thai 
culture -- a cross between Thai and Western influence -- is 
having a significant effect on a country which has very limited 
forms of modern entertainment and is only just emerging from the 
pall of the monotony of communism. 
  This is a period in time when the relationship between 
Thailand and Laos should be handled sensitively. The Lao and 
Thai governments would do well to work together in a spirit of 
cooperation to iron out contentious issues, including how they 
treat each others' nationals. This not only applies to Thai 
people in Laos, but also to Lao people in Thailand. Stories 
about the bad treatment of foreign nationals do not help.

  [Excerpts] Laotian Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat 
will lead a delegation to Bangkok soon for talks on the 
maintenance and administration of the Thai-Lao Mittraphap bridge 
across the Mekong River, informed sources said. 
  Talks, set tentatively for 8-9 February, will also focus on 
official preparations far His Majesty the King's visit to 
Vientiane on the eve of the historic April 8 opening. 
  The bridge, financed and built by Australia, completes the 
first land link between Thailand and Laos. 
  The opening will be presided over by the King and the 
President of Laos, Nouhak Phomsavan, in the presence of Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai, Laotian Prime Minister General Khamtai 
Siphandon, and Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. 
  However, the build-up to the handover is being plagued by a 
lack of agreement on the question of boundaries. Visa issues 
have also yet to be settled. [passage omitted] 
  Thailand maintains that the boundary on the bridge should be 
drawn at the deepest point of the river, the same line which 
marks the frontier along the Mekong River between Thailand and 
Laos. 
  Laos has argued that the two nations should each have 
jurisdiction over and responsibility for half the bridge, in 
accordance with international practice. This boundary would not 
replace the official frontier. 
  The differences have embarrassed both sides, as such basic 
issues were supposed to have been smoothed over earlier in 
anticipation of the historic inauguration of the "friendship" 
bridge that symbolizes cordial ties between the two neighbors. 
  The sources however said the talks are unlikely to focus on 
measures to facilitate the two-way entry into both sides through 
the bridge.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata said Monday [31 January] he plans to visit Russia if 
results of working-level talks between Japan and Russia 
scheduled in February are satisfactory, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. In a meeting with Gennadiy Burbulis, a close 
aide to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Hata said he plans to 
visit Russia but did not specify the timing, the officials said. 
  Burbulis said Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev hopes 
to hold talks regularly with his Japanese counterpart and that 
Russia welcomes a trip by Hata, according to the officials. 
  Hata told Burbulis he hopes frank discussions will be held 
during the bilateral working-level talks February 21 and 22 in 
Moscow on the two countries' territorial dispute and that he 
wants to visit Russia based on the outcome of the meeting, they 
said. The officials said a specific schedule will be worked out 
after studying the results of the February talks. 
  Burbulis, a lower house member of Russia's new Parliament 
and 
president of the Moscow-based Russian Political Strategy 
Research Center, is in Japan to attend a forum on security 
attended by experts from Japan, Russia and the United States. 
  In a 20-minute meeting, Hata told Burbulis reform must be 
achieved in Russia and that instability of the Russian 
Parliament should not be an excuse to delay the process of 
democratization and other reforms. 
  Burbulis voiced optimism toward Russian reform, saying he is 
not worried about the difficulties the new Russian Government 
faces and that he is certain the government will achieve reform, 
the officials said. Yeltsin will not allow the halt of the 
reforms, he was quoted as saying. 
  Earlier in the day, Burbulis met Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and congratulated him on the passage last weekend of 
political reform bills, the officials said. 
  Burbulis told Hosokawa in a 30-minute meeting that reforms 
in 
Russia are "irreversible" and that Yeltsin is making efforts to 
overcome the difficulties, they said. 
  Burbulis also said the enactment of a new Constitution has 
established a basis for Russia's political stability and that he 
hopes the Constitution will open new possibilities in solving 
problems between Japan and Russia, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Japan on Monday [31 
January] denied allegations by a British newspaper report that 
it may abandon its nonnuclear stance and choose to possess 
nuclear weapons. Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a 
press conference that Japan maintains its three-point nonnuclear 
principle of not possessing, producing or allowing nuclear 
weapons into Japan so that developing nuclear weapons is 
"impossible." 
  Saito said the ministry is investigating whether the British 
Ministry of Defense has compiled a report on the possibility of 
Japan's development of nuclear weapons, as was reported by the 
SUNDAY TIMES. The SUNDAY TIMES said the Ministry of Defense has 
warned Prime Minister John Major that North Korea's nuclear 
program may force Japan to abandon its nonnuclear stance. 
  The paper said Japan has acquired all the parts needed to 
make a nuclear weapon and may have built a bomb which requires 
only plutonium to be completed and that the risks were detailed 
in a paper to the Joint Intelligence Committee, the government's 
main security adviser to the cabinet. 
  Saito said the option to possess nuclear weapons would only 
contribute to the instability of the international environment 
surrounding Japan and that it runs counter to Japan's peace and 
prosperity. "So it is totally impossible that Japan will change 
the three-point nonnuclear principle," he said. 
  He added that Japan is a member of the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and that it also supports the indefinite 
extension of the treaty when it is reviewed in 1995. 
  If such a British Government report exists, Japan will have 
to once again make clear that it is impossible that Japan will 
opt to possess nuclear weapons and seek understanding from 
Britain and the international community, he said.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Hosokawa on an agreement on </F>
political reform bills with Liberal Democratic Party President 
Kono at a joint news conference at the Diet building in Tokyo -- 
live] 
  [Text] The pen is not mine, but as for the contents of the 
document, I have made considerable concessions to the 
LDP-proposed compromise plan. Today, as Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] President Kono said a moment ago, he and I 
intermittently held meetings which lasted over six hours with 
some intervals wherein we had time to study each other's 
proposal. As far as the details of our agreement are concerned, 
these are specified in the documents which are being handed out 
to you. As President Kono mentioned, we were summoned by House 
of Representatives Speaker Doi before 1900 this evening -- 
yesterday. Speaker Doi presented her proposal to us. With her 
proposal as the basis, President Kono and I started the 
meetings. I believe that Speaker Doi's proposal served as a 
catalyst or a remarkable start for producing such fruitful 
results. Although the speaker's proposal was not reflected 
satisfactorily in the agreement, we, with the speaker's proposal 
in mind, have agreed on each point specified in the documents 
handed out to you. 
  In conducting the meetings, President Kono and I discussed 
the political situation facing Japan. We have shared the common 
understanding that unless the political reform issue -- which 
has been discussed for over six years and which the people 
expected to be solved -- is brought to an end, it would be 
impossible to solve economic issues and regain the people's 
trust of politics, thus further undermining the international 
community's confidence in Japan. Given such a situation, we 
have shared a mutual understanding that it is necessary to take 
a broad view of the political reform issue to settle it. Based 
on such an understanding, we have had frank talks. As a result, 
overcoming our own difficulties, I, as the representative of the 
ruling parties, and President Kono, as the representative of his 
party -- as I have just said, we have reached the agreement from 
a standpoint of securing the national interest. 
  Since tomorrow is the final day of the current Diet session, 
I cannot make any comments now on specifically how plenary 
sessions will be conducted or the joint committee of both houses 
will be held, as that will be up to the Diet itself. However, I 
cannot find the words to describe how happy I feel that the 
political reform bills have come to be settled in this way. 
Regarding issues which are pending at a time like this, such as 
economic problems and the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, I 
would like to have Mr. Kono spend some time with me as soon as 
early next week to hold frank discussions. This is how I feel 
right now. I will respond to other issues in the 
question-and-answer session.

<F P=106> [Statement by Liberal Democratic Party President Kono on an </F>
agreement on political reform bills with Prime Minister Hosokawa 
at a joint news conference at the Diet building in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] As Mr. Prime Minister has just stated, the 
precondition for reaching this agreement lies in the 
understanding shared by both of us that there are numerous 
issues, both international and domestic, that have to be settled 
by politicians and that politicians have to take up their 
responsibility to settle them. 
  In particular, I understand that it is necessary to work out 
measures as soon as possible to deal with the recent economic 
situation. Moreover, while no decision has been made on the 
specific details concerning political reform, this term -- 
political reform -- seems to have been mentioned all around, and 
my concern is that such a situation may lead to misunderstanding 
in the international community. 
  And when we turn our eyes to the domestic situation, we note 
that it has been voiced all around that political reform has to 
be carried out, and I think many people share serious 
apprehensions about the recent situation because no decision has 
been made on the details of the political reform. 
  Anyway, while the people have persisted in demanding 
political reform, we have reached an accord -- shall I say the 
final accord at this point -- with Mr. Prime Minister on this 
issue. In reaching this accord, what I have called to my mind 
is the faces of many of our predecessors who have persistently 
tackled this issue and who have made efforts for this concern. 
As far as our party is concerned, there are many senior 
comrades, such as Mr. Masagoshi Ito. And while feeling 
gratitude for the efforts made by these predecessors, I have 
come to make this final resolution. 
  And I would like to conclude my report by expressing my 
gratitude to those comrades who have cooperated with me and 
given me their support in making this final decision. Now, I 
would like to invite you to ask your questions.

<F P=106> [Joint news conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa </F>
and Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono with 
unidentified correspondents at the Diet building -- live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] [first sentence indistinct] Prime 
Minister Hosokawa, can you tell us how the coalition parties -- 
particularly, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] -- 
will respond to this agreement? [sentence indistinct] Party 
President Kono, how do you think the group of political reform 
moderates within your party will react to it? Do you think you 
can persuade them to accept it? 
  [Hosokawa] I will answer first. I think there are strong 
voices calling on people, not only in the SDPJ but in all other 
groups, to restrain their own views and accommodate other views 
as much as possible. I am fully aware of that. Meanwhile, Mr. 
Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ, has kept me well informed of the 
views of the people in his party. I had to ask him to entrust 
me with the power to make a final decision, and he said that was 
unacceptable. However, he eventually agreed to give me the 
power to make a final decision to resolve the issues -- on my 
own judgment. 
  For me it was a very difficult decision to make. 
Nevertheless, corporate donations to political funds will be 
abolished after five years. At least the system will be better 
than the current one in that it will be more transparent. The 
agreement clearly states that the donations will abolished in 
five years. As such, it represents progress compared to the 
existing system. I agree with you that it has gone backward, 
somewhat, from the original draft bills, but I would like 
everyone's understanding on that point. 
  [Kono] All the Diet members of my party share the need to 
implement political reform. But as far as the question of how 
it should be done, there have been various views, and 
consequently there have been many discussions. But with the 
current special session of the Diet coming to an end, there were 
also feelings that we must conclude the matter somehow so that 
we can go on to tackle so many other pending important matters. 
Though I was also fully aware, on the other hand, of the views 
of those who think we should be more cautious about political 
reform. I came to this meeting, which began yesterday evening, 
bearing all this in mind. 
  To answer your question, I must say I think the prime 
minister underwent much torment -- or hardships -- in making his 
decision. 
  I once again pointed out to him the points my party has so 
long insisted on, and asked him to understand them. After all, 
agreement would have been impossible unless both sides were 
willing to make some concessions. I know the views of my 
party's people because I have talked to so many of them. I am 
confident the people in my party will accept the agreement. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kono, the meeting of the top leaders was 
held under the mediation of House of Representatives Speaker 
Doi. What conditions were presented to you in agreeing the 
meeting? [sentence indistinct] 
  [Kono] House of Representatives Speaker Doi told me she was 
worried about the state of the Diet -- about whether the Diet, 
now coming to an end of its session, was meeting expectations of 
the people. The two of us were called in separately. Speaker 
Doi noted that the matter needed to be resolved, and presented 
several alternatives, proposing that we reach agreement along 
the lines of one of these proposals. It seems Prime Minister 
Hosokawa received some proposals from Speaker Doi as well. 
After we had received the speaker's suggestions we decided to 
meet and discuss them. 
  I think the prime minister should speak as he, too, met the 
speaker. 
  [Hosokawa] I don't know which of us was called in first, and 
I did not ask about it. But we were separately called into the 
speaker's office and given the proposals as I explained earlier. 
One was on the matter of when the bills should become effective, 
another was a suggestion to set up a negotiating body to deal 
with the contents of the bills. Her proposal was on these two 
points. It was valuable advice which came at a time when things 
were becoming very urgent. At the time I expressed the hope 
that, given the situation, she would impress on Mr. Kono the 
desirability of holding a meeting of top leaders. The meeting 
subsequently took place. At the meeting, much time was devoted 
to discussing the question of setting up a negotiating body, as 
proposed by the speaker. 
  But our discussions were unable to make headway on this, and 
it turned out that we could accept -- or make good use of -- 
only the proposal concerning the date the bills become 
effective. As far as the contents of the agreement were 
concerned, however, both sides were able to narrow their views 
in the course of discussions. I reported this to the speaker. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] ...please let me ask a 
question of both Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. President. [Words 
indistinct] ...could you describe how your latest decision will 
affect the future of the ties among coalition parties as well as 
coalition-opposition relations? 
  [Hosokawa] That is a difficult question. To be honest with 
you, I cannot make a prediction. 
  [Kono] I think that is a very good question. I cannot yet 
make a prediction on how effective the political reform bills 
will be. But as the prime minister said earlier, there are a 
mountain of difficult issues pending, such as the Japan-U.S. 
economic talks and the economic stimulus measures, which have a 
bearing on the lives of the people, and which are still waiting 
to be resolved. I think, when it comes to defending the quality 
of life of the people, it will be possible for the LDP to make 
proposals to the prime minister. We have long experience in 
running government and, as such, have the capability. 
  [Hosokawa] I spoke of it a little earlier, but when you 
realize the seriousness of the situation facing the nation now, 
it is necessary to call a truce in the political war and tackle 
the economic and other pending issues. As for your question 
about the future of the coalition government, I agree it is a 
good question. But, as I said earlier, it is very difficult to 
make a prediction at this stage. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kono, please let me reconfirm some 
points from my previous question. How does your agreement 
define the date the bills take effect? 
  [Kono] That is on the paper. 
  [Correspondent] Do you mean the bills are frozen for the 
time being? 
  [Kono] Please refer to the last two lines of the preface. 
  [Correspondent] I suppose revision of the bills will be 
discussed during the next ordinary Diet session. How soon, 
then, before the Diet is ready for that session? 
  [Kono] That is on the paper. Please read what the paper 
says. The paper says the revision of the bills should be 
discussed before deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget. 
Please read it carefully. 
  [Correspondent] My question is for Mr. Prime Minister. 
Compared to the bills provided by the government, the final 
agreement is very different from the original plan. I thought 
the government worked out the original proposal to pursue its 
ideals and philosophy. Did you forget about your ideals and 
philosophy when you accepted the drastic revision? 
  [Hosokawa] There may be criticism of my decision. However, 
as I repeatedly noted earlier, the enactment of political reform 
bills has been the biggest pending issue of the last six years. 
Taking into account how the issue affects our economic and 
foreign policies, I had to change the basic framework of 
politics taking into account wide-ranging viewpoints. I made my 
final decision from such viewpoints.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa barely managed to hang onto power early Saturday [29 
January] by signing an eleventh-hour compromise pact with 
opposition leader Yohei Kono to ensure passage through the Diet 
of his political reform program. 
  "We agreed to resolve this issue in this manner in 
consideration of the state and the people," Hosokawa said at a 
joint news conference with Kono, president of the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  "I am filled with deep emotion," Hosokawa said about the way 
legislation had been concluded, after signing a 10-point 
agreement on the final shape of the four-bill package. 
  Kono, who signed the accord after Hosokawa, said they 
confirmed that the two are responsible for tackling 
international and domestic challenges now that the conclusion of 
the debate on long-delayed political reform is assured. 
  "We could not have reached the agreement without the spirit 
of concession," he said. "I am happy that we reached the 
accord." 
  Hosokawa and Kono negotiated for nearly six hours with only 
brief breaks from Friday night to early Saturday, the final day 
of the current extraordinary Diet session. 
  Hosokawa had staked his political future on enactment by 
Saturday of necessary measures to revamp Japan's corrupt 
political system through electoral changes and tighter curbs on 
campaign funding. 
  The agreement calls for replacing the present 511 multiseat 
constituencies for the House of Representatives with a mix of 
300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional 
representation seats. 
  The accord also provides one fund-raising group for each 
politician to receive donations from businesses and 
organizations. 
  The government's political reform bills will win 
parliamentary clearance on Saturday, but will be revised in the 
next regular Diet session, according to the compromise deal. 
  Hosokawa, who heads the seven-party coalition government, 
revealed he will hold another round of talks with Kono early 
next week to discuss the languishing Japanese economy and the 
Japan-U.S. framework trade negotiations and other issues of 
national concern. 
  Hosokawa noted that he had to make some painful decisions 
against the largest force in the coalition, the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], in his talks with Kono. 
  While acknowledging that the revision amounts to a retreat 
from the government's original package, the premier noted the 
amended legislation would make the flow of corporate and 
organizational donations to individual politicians "more 
transparent, at least than under the current law." 
  The SDPJ had demanded that individual legislators be 
prohibited from receiving such money, which is seen as a root 
cause of rampant graft in Japanese politics. 
  Asked if the joint appearance before the press with his 
political archrival Kono will affect the framework of the ruling 
coalition, Hosokawa said, "honestly, I cannot make any 
prediction." 
  Kono said a number of national challenges, including the 
bilateral trade talks with the United States and the sluggish 
economy, are critical to the quality of life in Japan, and he 
expressed the LDP's readiness to supply the coalition government 
with its expertise and manpower. 
  The LDP held the reins of government for 38 years until last 
August, when Hosokawa's coalition knocked the party from power. 
  Hosokawa said he and Kono concurred that there are numerous 
issues that cannot be resolved without making a "political truce" 
between the two factions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- The main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] on Saturday [29 January] endorsed a 
compromise over political reform reached between Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono, officials of the 
parties said. 
  The LDP reached the accord at a meeting of the highest 
decision-making body of the Executive Council and the SDPJ, the 
largest force in the seven-party ruling coalition, at a meeting 
of members of both houses of the Diet. 
  Hosokawa and Kono reached a basic accord Friday night in 
eleventh-hour talks to break the impasse over the 
government-proposed political reform bills on which Hosokawa had 
staked his political career.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- The House of 
Representatives on Saturday [29 January] approved the ruling 
coalition's political reform package whose key phases are set to 
be revised at the regular Diet session slated to convene on 
Monday. The two-tier arrangement on parliamentary proceedings 
was hammered out at an eleventh-hour, horse-trading session 
between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Liberal Democratic 
Party President Yohei Kono from Friday night to early Saturday. 
  The powerful lower chamber of Japan's two-chamber Diet gave 
its blessing to the legislation by a stand-up vote. 
  The seven parties of the ruling coalition and the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) endorsed the 
compromise. The opposition Japanese Communist Party voted 
against the package. 
  The legislation is almost certain to clear a subsequent 
House 
of Councillors session later in the day, the final day of the 
current extraordinary Diet session. 
  A date for implementation of the legislation was deleted 
from 
the government's original bills in line with the agreement 
between Hosokawa and Kono. The timing of the enforcement of the 
new law will be finalized through debate at the onset of the 
regular Diet session. 
  Earlier in the day, the joint committee of both houses of 
the 
Diet approved the compromise over political reform reached 
between Hosokawa and Kono. 
  The 20-legislator joint committee was set up after the upper 
house voted down the package on January 21, forcing the ruling 
coalition to mount desperate efforts to salvage the bills. The 
reform package passed the lower house on November 18. 
  After talks at the panel deadlocked, the stalemate was 
finally broken in top-level negotiations between Hosokawa and 
Kono.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at the </F>
prime minister's official residence -- live] 
  [Text] [Unidentified dean of press corps] We are now 
beginning a news conference with Prime Minister Hosokawa. The 
extraordinary Diet session ends today and a package of political 
reform bills has been enacted in the Diet. Ruling and 
opposition parties have agreed to amend the enacted bills at the 
next ordinary Diet session. I think there will be various 
questions about the settlement of the political reform bills, 
but as dean of the press corps, I would like to ask what the 
Hosokawa cabinet will do from now on. The Hosokawa cabinet has 
continued to delay mapping out a new package of stimulus 
measures and compiling a budget for fiscal 1994. Mr. Prime 
Minister, how are you going to deal with these policy tasks? In 
particular, income tax reduction has become a focal point. Mr. 
Prime Minister, how much do you plan to cut income tax? How are 
you going to make up for a fiscal shortfall incurred from cuts 
in the income tax? I hope you will answer my questions 
specifically. 
  [Hosokawa] Among other things, I would like to mention the 
political reform bills. The bills were passed a while ago in 
the House of Councillors but it cannot be said that they have 
been enacted completely. First, I would like to say that the 
government has hurdled a big obstacle, which is the passage of 
the political reform bills. Now, I feel relieved. The passage 
of the political reform bills in the Diet has been the most 
important policy task for my cabinet. Looking ahead, there are 
many mountains I will have to scale, and I believe I will scale 
these mountains one by one. I feel anew that my cabinet is 
saddled with a lot of difficult policy tasks. It is really good 
that both the ruling and opposition parties have managed to pass 
the bills in the Diet in response to the people's hopes, and I 
would like to express my gratitude anew to the people for their 
support. This is what I am now feeling. 
  I was asked about stimulus measures. Now that the bills have 
been passed in the Diet, it goes without saying that the 
immediate task for me is to map out a package of stimulus 
measures. Currently, relevant offices, with the Economic 
Planning Agency at the center, are preparing economic measures. 
However, I am hoping to complete them by the end of next week, 
if possible. We are still not ready to disclose their scale or 
contents. But we want to have a pump-priming package that can 
generate the immediate effect of spurring Japan's economy. 
There was a question about income tax reduction. At 1730 
today, the Economic Reform Council held a meeting and I have 
asked the council to discuss ways to cut the income tax. There 
was a question about compilation of the budget for the fiscal 
1994. As for the third supplementary budget, I would like to 
submit it to the Diet after completing the economic measures, or 
after coming back from the United States. We will submit it as 
soon as we can. Also, as for the fiscal 1994 budget, we will 
tentatively announce it by 10 February if possible -- although 
we are still not at a stage to announce something definite -- 
and approve the government's proposal after I return from the 
United States. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Now that the bills have been passed 
in the Diet, political parties are expected to quickly move 
toward realignment. Mr. Prime Minister, do you have any 
blueprint for forming a ruling coalition party? 
  [Hosokawa] I do not know how the political parties will be 
realigned in the future. It seems to me that the realignment of 
political parties will not take concrete shape so soon. 
  [Dean of press corps] Prime Minister. You are scheduled 
to visit the United States on 11 February to hold Japan-U.S. 
summit talks. You are going to hold the talks while you are 
faced with many tasks, including the Japan-U.S. comprehensive 
trade talks. Can you explain your fundamental stance regarding 
the upcoming meeting with President Clinton? 
  [Hosokawa] This is going to be our third meeting. I think 
it will be a venue for confirming what we have been doing 
through our series of meetings. We are having the final 
discussions on both macro and micro issues. These are very 
difficult issues. We are doing our best to produce an outcome 
satisfactory to both sides before the Japan-U.S. summit talks. 
As for the macroissues, the United States is insisting, more 
than anything else, on the need for Japan to introduce measures 
designed to reduce our trade surplus -- including economic 
stimulus measures, increase of domestic demand, and the tax 
system issue. The United States is strongly demanding we take 
daring measures as much as possible. Well, I should rather say 
this is the largest concern of the United States. We are 
planning to do our best to come up with a package before the 
summit talks. As for the microissues -- such as government 
procurement, insurance services, and autos -- the opinions of 
Japan and the United States are divided over fundamental issues, 
including the two-way dialogue system [sohoko seido], target 
figures, and the extent of the government's influence on private 
companies. However, I am of the opinion that we have to clearly 
insist on our stance. We are now having the final discussions on 
these issues. I have instructed the government officials to 
somehow find a point of compromise and thereby conclude the 
comprehensive trade talks. 
  [Dean of press corps] Will the issue of tax reduction be 
included in the economic measures which will be announced next 
week? 
  [Hosokawa] Well, I still do not know about that. As I have 
said earlier, we are still not at a stage to clearly explain 
their scale or contents. We will complete drawing up the 
measures as soon as we can. 
  [Unidentified reporter] I think the people are worried about 
the new electoral system. Can you explain how much public 
opinion will be reflected under this system? 
  [Hosokawa] We had long discussions at the Diet as well on 
the issue of reflecting the people's will. This issue was 
talked about at council meetings too. As we all know, a 
compromise was reached between the ruling parties and the 
Liberal Democratic Party, which is the largest opposition party. 
I do not think this combination of the single-seat and 
proportional representation systems will only help political 
parties merge into a fewer number of groups. My fundamental 
understanding is that this system was formed after giving 
thorough consideration to the people's will. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister. At the joint 
news conference held last night, you said you will hold a summit 
meeting again with the LDP president to discuss issues regarding 
the economic situation and the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks. I am wondering if such talks will lead to the LDP's 
support of the government from outside the cabinet in the future 
in a broad sense. This is my first question. The next question 
is about the pending issue concerning a merger of your party, 
Japan New Party [JNP] and Sakigake -- which would mean the 
establishment of a new-New Party. How is this issue 
progressing? I would like to ask you these two questions. 
  [Hosokawa] I said to LDP President Kono I would like to 
frankly discuss the issues concerning the economy or Japan-U.S. 
relations -- there may be other issues -- with him as early as 
the beginning of next week. I think it is very important to 
occasionally hold such meetings, particularly with President 
Kono of the LDP, which is the largest party in the Diet. I do 
want to have such meetings when opportunities arise, and I hope 
we can cooperate with each other as much as possible over what 
we can do. But I do not think -- I think your question is about 
the possibility of forming a powerful coalition that includes 
the LDP -- such cooperative moves will lead to forming such a 
coalition. As for the issue of JNP's merger with Sakigake, I 
think it is necessary to see how the political situation and 
moves toward regrouping political parties develop after the 
political reform bills are passed. Forming a collaborative group 
in the Diet, the JNP and Sakigake are actually already 
cooperating with each other, and at present there is no big 
obstacle to the two parties' activities. I would like to study 
this issue while seeing how moves toward the realignment of 
political circles develop. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister. With the 
passage of the political reform bills, government subsidies will 
be provided for political parties. However, originally, the 
ruling coalition's proposal was that the government subsidy 
system should be introduced on the assumption that donations by 
corporations and organizations to individual politicians would 
be banned. But I think the people must be considering the 
agreement on that point as running counter to the original 
proposal. What do you think? 
  [Hosokawa] This question was also raised at the news 
conference yesterday. I am fully aware of the fact that there 
are doubts about that point. However, the LDP asserted that as 
a matter of fact, it is impossible for the party to accept the 
government's original proposal in a single stroke. With the 
LDP's position in mind, therefore, I have reached a compromise 
on abolishing donations by corporations and organizations after 
five years, as an interim measure. However, I believe the 
agreement proposes various measures: namely, politicians will be 
required to report their acceptance of donations if a donation 
exceeds 50,000 yen -- currently the amount of donations subject 
to reporting is over 1 million yen -- and the penal regulations 
will be beefed up. In this way, I think drastic measures will 
be taken to make political donations more transparent, and to 
strengthen penal regulations. I believe the people will 
certainly understand that point.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- The 129th regular Diet 
session opened Monday [31 January] as Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa prepared to draw up an economic expansion program 
following a narrow weekend victory over political reform 
legislation. The House of Councillors started a full session at 
10 AM, kicking off the Japanese parliament's 150-day term that 
ends June 29. The House of Representatives begins its full 
session at 2 PM. 
  The regular Diet session will immediately go into recess, 
probably until February 8, to allow the coalition government to 
map out a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the 
fiscal 1994 budget. 
  Hosokawa, fresh from a tough but successful battle over 
political reform bills, will find his hands full with a long 
list of tasks, including a summit meeting with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11 and a new economic 
stimulus package worth about 15 trillion yen, official sources 
said. 
  The pump-primer package will contain an income tax reduction 
of some 6 trillion yen, which will become part of the fiscal 
1994 budget program starting April 1, the sources said. 
  Hosokawa's policy address to both houses of the Diet will be 
delayed at least until late February, making it increasingly 
difficult for the Hosokawa cabinet to win parliamentary passage 
of the fiscal 1994 budget before the end of the current fiscal 
year March 31, the sources said. Under that pessimistic 
scenario, the sources said, Hosokawa has to fashion a 
provisional budget program to keep the government running, in 
addition to the current fiscal year's third supplementary budget 
to help lift the economy out of its worst postwar recession. 
  At about the same time, his coalition government has to work 
with the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to 
modify the political reform legislation which barely passed the 
Diet on Saturday, the final day of the extraordinary session, 
coalition lawmakers acknowledged. 
  The controversial legislation calls for replacing the 511 
multiseat constituencies for the powerful lower house with a 
combination of 300 single-seat electoral districts and 200 
proportional representation seats. It also provides a single 
fund-raising organization for each politician to solicit 
donations from businesses and other groups. 
  Backed by veteran back room strategist Ichiro Ozawa, 
Hosokawa 
managed to broker the political reform deal with LDP President 
Yohei Kono in what critics called a "dango" or big-rigging 
fashion. 
  The Finance Ministry, under pressure at home and abroad to 
take more effective economic stimulus measures, will unveil its 
fiscal 1994 budget program and the government will formally 
decide on its fiscal 1994 budget around February 15 after some 
modifications, officials said. 
  Additionally, the officials said, the Hosokawa government 
will submit to the Diet the current fiscal year's third 
supplementary budget program aimed at buoying the stagnant 
domestic economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Shusei Tanaka, a special 
adviser to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, leaves his post 
Monday [31 January] in line with a promise to step down 
following completion of the premier's top priority task of 
political reform, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
said. 
  Tanaka earlier told Hosokawa that he would serve as special 
adviser until Diet debate on political reform ended, the top 
government spokesman told a news conference. 
  The government's political reform package, aimed at rooting 
out political graft, cleared the Diet on Saturday after Hosokawa 
and Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party, struck a deal on making modifications in the 
next regular Diet session. 
  Tanaka, the No. 2 man of Sakigake (Harbinger), a small 
component of Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, will concentrate 
on party affairs from now on, said Takemura, who heads Sakigake. 
He has pledged his continued support for Hosokawa, according to 
the chief cabinet secretary. 
  Takemura said Tanaka's resignation has nothing to do with 
his 
remarks last week suggesting Hosokawa would disband the cabinet 
and step down from power if his political reform bid ended in 
failure. 
  Tanaka, 53, has been elected to the House of Representatives 
three times from the No. 1 constituency of Nagano Prefecture.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Shusei Tanaka stepped down 
Monday [31 January] as special adviser to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, saying his job of helping to enact political 
reform was done. 
  "I felt a great responsibility for having advocated a 
political reform government," Tanaka told reporters at the 
headquarters of Sakigake (Harbinger), a small component of 
Hosokawa's seven-party coalition government and a party to which 
he belongs. "I could not have quit if the political reform 
bills had not gone through," he said. "But I can step down with 
a stirring feeling because they were enacted." 
  Tanaka, 53, the No. 2 man of Sakigake, said his resignation 
is in line with an accord with Hosokawa that he would step down 
once Diet debate on political reform ends. 
  The government's political reform package cleared the Diet 
on 
Saturday after Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party, reached a compromise on its 
amendments in the next regular Diet session. 
  Hosokawa had staked his political fate on enactment by the 
Saturday close of the extraordinary Diet session. The measures 
are designed to clean up Japan's money driven political system 
and clamp curbs on political donations. 
  Saying it is now time to fulfill his duty as a Sakigake 
member to meet public expectations for the party, Tanaka 
expressed hope he can continue supporting Hosokawa from outside 
the government. 
  No one will take up the post of special adviser to the 
premier after Tanaka quits, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura told a Monday morning news conference. 
  The Hosokawa administration's next main task should be 
administrative reform, Tanaka said, noting it is politicians, 
not bureaucrats, who should be responsible for the way policies 
are carried out. "I got the impression that the Diet has not 
played its role sufficiently in closely monitoring 
administrative authorities," he noted. 
  Tanaka has been elected to the House of Representatives 
three 
times from the No. 1 constituency of Nagano Prefecture.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- The government and ruling 
coalition will convene a meeting of a newly created consultative 
body Saturday evening [29 January] upon passage through the Diet 
of four political reform bills to draft a package of stimulative 
economic measures and a budget for fiscal 1994 which starts in 
April, government sources said. 
  The consultative body, chaired by Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, began discussions on the fiscal 1994 budget late last 
year. The debate was stalled earlier this month, however, due 
to political turmoil after the rejection of the reform bills by 
the House of Councillors January 21. 
  Friday's agreement on political reforms reached between 
Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party, prompted the government and 
governing coalition to make haste in weaving together steps to 
rev up the flagging economy, the sources said. 
  The consultative body, made up of cabinet ministers in 
charge 
of economic affairs and representatives of the ruling coalition 
parties, is determined to set the timetable for drafting the 
national budget on Saturday, they said. 
  Saturday's discussion is expected to focus on when to raise 
the 3 percent consumption tax as a means of securing funds to 
implement major income and residential tax cuts, the sources 
said. 
  Indications are that the government will announce the 
pump-priming package by the end of next week and have the 
Ministry of Finance adopt its budget proposal around February 10 
ahead of a summit meeting between Hosokawa and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton in Washington February 11. 
  The government intends to adopt its draft budget in 
mid-February, sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- Top businessmen called on 
the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
Saturday [29 January] to implement income tax cuts "as soon as 
possible" to prop up the faltering economy. The request 
followed the Diet's passage of four political reform bills 
earlier in the day as a result of a compromise accord reached 
between Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party in a last-ditch meeting late 
Friday. 
  The attention of the business community now focuses on how 
speedily the Hosokawa administration will carry out economic 
stimulative measures. Business leaders by and large believe the 
foundation has been laid for stimulating the post-bubble, 
stagnant economy. 
  Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation, noted the economy is now in critical shape. 
  "I strongly hope the government will draft a budget (for 
fiscal 1994) and implement pump-priming measures at the earliest 
possible time, including a substantial cut in income taxes," 
said Saito, also chairman of Nippon Steel Corp., the world's 
largest steel producer. The view was shared by Kohei Abe, head 
of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, who said he also 
wants the government to grapple with trade issues with the 
United States in a positive way ahead of a February 11 summit 
between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington. 
  Reiichi Yumikura, chairman of the Japan Chemical Fibers 
Association, said Hosokawa should take the leadership in 
reducing income taxes "retroactively and speedily." 
  Meanwhile, an executive of a major automaker expressed the 
view that Diet approval of the political reform program has made 
it possible for the coalition government of Prime Minister 
Hosokawa to bolster its power base. 
  "This in turn indicates Hosokawa may be able to exchange 
views frankly with Clinton on bilateral problems such as trade 
imbalances and the yen's ascent against the U.S. dollar," he 
said. 
  Japanese automakers, electronics companies and other 
export-oriented manufacturers have been badly hurt by the rapid 
appreciation of the yen in value which makes their products 
abroad more expensive.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- The coalition government of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to work out next week a 
new round of 15-16 trillion yen pump-priming measures that will 
include income tax cuts, officials said Saturday [29 January]. 
  The officials said the decision was made at a meeting of the 
Council on Economic Problems formed by the government and 
parties in the ruling coalition. "A decision (on the tax 
problem) will be made either Monday evening or Tuesday morning 
at the latest," Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, told reporters. 
  Shortly after a compromise political reform program was 
passed by both houses of the Diet earlier Saturday, Hosokawa 
told a news conference that he has no plan at present to raise 
the consumption tax rate from the present 3 percent. 
  The officials said the council also decided to complete 
fiscal 1994 budget by February 15. 
  Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning 
Agency, said it would be difficult to set any definite timing 
for a consumption tax hike in view of the current economic 
situation. 
  Government sources said the ruling coalition plans to carry 
out tax cuts totaling from 6 to 7 trillion yen, separate from a 
consumption tax increase. The sources said the proposed 
reduction, covering both income and local taxes, will be put 
into effect, retroactive to January 1, and deficit-covering 
national bonds would be issued to cover revenue shortfalls. 
  The sources said discussions at the economic council focused 
on how to raise funds for the tax cuts. 
  The Finance Ministry insists that the tax cuts be carried 
out 
in tandem with a hike in the consumption tax from the current 3 
percent to 7 percent around April 1995, the sources said. They 
said the ministry wants to use the revenue increase from the 
consumption tax hike to redeem national bonds to be issued for 
the income tax cuts. 
  The ruling parties, however, contend that measures to ease 
the tax burden on low income earners should be taken first, the 
sources said. They said discussions on the consumption tax hike 
will likely be carried over into fiscal 1996.

  [Text] Takamatsu, Jan. 30 KYODO -- The coalition 
government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to announce 
on Wednesday [2 February] or Thursday a comprehensive package of 
pump-priming measures to shore up the economy now in a prolonged 
slump, the top government spokesman said Sunday. Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura did not reveal the size of the 
package. 
  Government sources say the business stimulating measures 
will 
total 15 to 16 trillion yen and will include 7 trillion yen in 
income and resident tax cuts. 
  Takemura said the cuts and revenue sources for them will be 
specified in the plan. The government and ruling coalition 
parties "will decide in the first half of this week on how big 
the income tax and resident tax cuts should be, whether 
corporate taxes can also be reduced and how to finance such tax 
cuts," he said. 
  Takemura spoke at a reception in Takamatsu, Shikoku Island, 
sponsored by his party, Sakigake (Harbinger). 
  Takemura, who is Hosokawa's chief spokesman and chief of 
staff, said many leaders of the coalition's seven parties share 
the view that the tax cuts should be implemented for a certain 
period of time before the consumption tax is raised from the 
present 3 percent. The Finance Ministry insists the cuts be 
carried out in tandem with a hike in the consumption tax to 7 
percent around April 1995, government sources say.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
parties and the government are split over whether income tax 
cuts should be carried out in tandem with a consumer tax hike as 
part of a pump-priming package to be worked out later this week, 
government sources said Monday [31 January]. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa showed a preference for the 
tax cut and tax hike to be dealt with together, saying Monday he 
did not understand what Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura meant when he said the two issues should be considered 
separately. [passage omitted[ 
  But two other influential figures, Wataru Kubo, secretary 
general of the Social Democratic Party, the biggest party in the 
coalition government, and Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito, 
sided with Takemura. "I think it's a good idea," Ozawa said. 
  Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito secretary general, also indicated 
approval for making the income tax cut ahead of the tax hike, 
describing Takemura as being "brave" in making such a comment. 
  An official of Hosokawa's Japan New Party said Takemura's 
comments " do not necessarily reflect the government's policy." 
  The issue will be discussed later Monday at a joint economic 
forum of government officials and ruling party leaders to be 
presided over by Tsutomu Hata, deputy premier and foreign 
minister. The joint meeting is to start at 5 PM. 
  The issue of income tax cuts is the core of the cabinet's 
pump-priming package to salvage the ailing economy, to be 
finalized Thursday, according to Finance Minister Fujii.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii stressed the government's policy Monday [31 January] of 
implementing a cut in income tax and a rise in the consumption 
tax in a single package. He made the comment at a press meeting 
soon after consulting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura to confirm their 
remarks over the weekend indicating a revision of government 
policy. 
  He said he complained to Takemura over his remarks and said 
they made it difficult for him to fulfill his responsibilities 
as finance minister. 
  Fujii said he reiterated that under the government's basic 
policy of conducting the tax cut and hike as a single measure, a 
joint economic forum of the government and ruling parties is to 
decide on the tax issue "in two or three days." He said 
Takemura agreed and told him that news reports did not reflect 
his "real intention." He later saw Hosokawa, who also agreed 
with him. 
  Takemura had hinted at a reception hosted by his party, 
Sakigake, on Sunday, that there was a possibility of separating 
the tax hike and of issuing deficit-covering bonds to finance 
the tax cut. 
  Hosokawa told reporters Saturday that he was not considering 
a consumption tax hike. 
  Meanwhile, Fujii repeated his strong opposition to the 
issuance of "untreated" deficit-financing bonds, and called for 
the timing and other concrete details of a consumption tax hike 
to be stipulated in the same law as an income tax cut so as to 
guarantee repayment of bonds issued to cover the time lag 
between the tax cut and hike.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31. KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa took issue Monday [31 January] with a remark by the 
chief government spokesman that it would be difficult to propose 
income tax cuts in tandem with an increase in the consumption 
tax. Hosokawa told reporters he did not understand what Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura meant when he said the two 
issues should be considered separately. 
  Takemura made the remark Sunday at a news conference in 
Takamatsu, western Japan. He said many leaders in the 
seven-party coalition share the view that income tax cuts should 
be implemented first. The increase in the consumption tax from 
3 percent would cover revenue shortfall. 
  Takemura seemed to be feeling the political heat Monday 
since 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii complained to him, saying he 
wanted both topics dealt with as a single package. Fujii said 
Takemura's remark made it difficult for him to fulfill his 
responsibilities as finance minister. 
  Takemura tried to allay concern, telling reporters Monday 
that what he meant to convey was that a general view on tax 
issues had emerged within the seven-party coalition. 
  A government source, meanwhile, insisted on spelling out the 
timing and the scale of raising the consumption tax in the bill, 
saying to do otherwise would be irresponsible of the Finance 
Ministry. 
  At Sunday's press conference, Takemura said that on 
Wednesday 
or Thursday the government plans to announce a comprehensive 
package of pump-priming measures to lift the economy out of the 
doldrums. Government sources said the business stimulating 
measures will total 15 to 16 trillion yen and include 7 trillion 
yen in income and resident tax cuts.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Japanese Government offices 
are at odds over an economic growth projection for fiscal 1994, 
beginning on April 1, officials said Monday [31 January]. 
  The government is likely to set an official economic growth 
estimate around February 9 as a basis for its budget for the 
year. But the officials said the Finance Ministry, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Economic 
Planning Agency (EPA) disagree on growth predictions. 
  The Finance Ministry and MITI say the annual growth rate for 
gross domestic product (GDP) should be set at somewhere between 
2.5 and 3.0 percent, while the EPA says it should be slightly 
above 2 percent, the officials said. The estimate for fiscal 
1993 was 3.3 percent. 
  The three departments are scheduled to start ironing out 
their differences as soon as the government announces its new 
pump-priming package on Thursday, which is expected to feature 
major income tax cuts and additional public works spending. 
  EPA officials predicted the real economic growth rate for 
fiscal 1993, which ends March 31, will be slightly above zero, 
managing to stay in the plus column. They forecast the growth 
rate for fiscal 1994 will barely record 2 percent, even taking 
into account the effects of the new pump-priming package. 
  The Finance Ministry, however, says the growth estimate 
should be set at close to 3 percent so that the government will 
avoid issuing deficit-covering bonds other than those for 
offsetting tax cuts. The MITI hopes to set a similar growth 
target.

  [Text] The U.S. Senate has voted to set up a Radio Free 
Asia. Following is our radio comment on the issue: 
  BBC Radio last weekend described the radio service as the 
plan belonging to right-wing Americans who [word indistinct] or 
to popularize American ideal and way of life. 
  The spokesman for the Chinese Government declared that the 
decision trampled upon the principle of international relations 
and interfered in the internal affairs of China and other Asian 
countries. China demanded that the decision be reversed. The 
People's Democratic Republic of Korea or North Korea and Myanmar 
[Burma] also voiced disagreement, and some Americans also 
rejected the move of the U.S. Senate. 
  It is believed that the establishment of the radio is the 
form of the old cold war, and it is not useful and appreciable 
especially when economic ties between the U.S. and Asia are 
developing. 
  A spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said: The 
American radio service harms not only socioeconomic development 
of Asian countries but also relations between the United States 
and these countries. 
  The decision to set up Radio Free Asia is rejected in Asia 
and by some American people. After the cold war, the situation 
in the world and in Asia has changed. Asia has become a more 
peaceful, stable, developing, and dynamic zone in comparision 
with other regions. Therefore, all countries in the region wish 
to broaden multilateral and diversify cooperation relations in 
order to defend peace and security. Many other countries in the 
world and the U.S.A. welcome and respect this intention. As a 
result, the establishment of Radio Free Asia will run counter to 
this trend and will worsen positive development between U.S.A. 
and Asian countries.

<F P=106> [Essay by Doan Chuong: "Dialogue on Human Rights"] </F>
  [Text] In an interview with VNA on 13 January, Deputy 
Foreign Minister Le Mai clarified our policy of holding a 
dialogue with other countries on human rights. This is another 
manifestation of our government's open-door foreign policy. 
  Although being an agonizing victim of the confrontration on 
human rights, we are ready to hold a dialogue on human rights 
because we are Vietnamese. And just as Uncle Ho put it: We are 
clear and straightforward. We only demand independence and 
freedom without harboring any personal hatred. We want the 
world to realize that we are a civilized nation, even more 
civilized than the assets-plundering and country-invading 
clique. It is not that those wanting to have a dialogue on 
human rights with us are in the same situation as us, but rather 
those countries which once confronted us on human rights. We 
are ready to a hold dialogue with them and we wonder if they 
will behave like civilized people while talking with us or will 
they display a lack of civilized attitudes as they usually do? 
  First, we would like to talk about the United States. They 
once helped the French colonialists re-invade our country and 
they were reported to have at times shouldered as much as 60 
percent of the war expense for the French. They then sent their 
troops to invade the southern part of our country and they 
launched barbarous air strikes against the north, creating 
untold deaths and suffering and lingering cultural, social, and 
environmental consequences. They have also imposed a protracted 
embargo against us, thus violating the right to development of 
our people and their legitimate human rights. 
  It is clear that over the past 40 years, they have 
confronted 
us on human rights and now they want a dialogue on the issue. 
Will they prepare to repay their human rights debts for the 
Vietnamese people? Or will they, after failing to defeat us in 
their human rights confrontations, now change their tricks by 
resorting to a human rights dialogue to subjugate us? 
  U.S. political circles have noisily talked about their human 
rights-based foreign policy. Their radio stations are daily 
harping about U.S. human rights values. But everyone knows that 
the United States itself was the mastermind of the nuclear 
disasters at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While boasting about their 
human rights protection policy, they are trying to perfect their 
mass-destruction weapons. We do not want to interfere in their 
internal affairs, but we are aware that the United States' 
Declaration of Independence of 1776 stated that everyone is born 
equal. But since then, African Americans in their country have 
continued to suffer from the bad practice of deep-seated racial 
discrimination. Although the American black makes up only 15 
percent of the U.S. population, the number of black prisoners 
accounts for 50 percent of the nation's total. According to 
figures provided by the Census Bureau in a 1992 report, 32.7 
percent of American blacks live below the poverty line. This 
means that one in every three American blacks live below the 
poverty line. The gap between the rich and the poor is 
extremely wide. In 1991, the annual income of one-fifth of the 
richest Americans constituted 46.5 percent of the total national 
income. Whereas, the annual income of one-fifth of the poorest 
accounted for only 3.8 percent of the total national income. 
  His excellency Mr. (Brzezinski) once said that the 
violence-exalting television- and movie-based culture was 
creating the highest murder rate in any civilized country in the 
world. In 1993, there were 390,000 killings of that nature in 
the United States. One may ask, is this representative of U.S. 
human rights values? 
  Australia is also a country which is very enthusiastic about 
asking for a human rights dialogue. But we wonder if certain 
forces still remember that they once joined with the United 
States in confronting us on human rights during the recent war. 
We also do not want to interfere in their internal affairs but 
we know that after 200 years, it was only in November last year 
that their parliament, after 50 hours of debate, eventually 
agreed to recognize the land ownership of the Aborigines. 
  There are many other countries which once rivaled us on 
human 
rights for a long period of time. We welcomed President 
Mitterand for having personally traveled to Dien Bien Phu to 
close a page of past history. But the human rights debts owed 
to the Vietnamese people are still there and cannot be easily 
ignored. Morals do not allow them to forget. We do not want to 
interfere in their internal affairs but we are aware that in 
their countries, there are numerous problems related to human 
rights. Morally, they must learn to address their own problems 
before talking about teaching other people to do this or do that. 
  With our age-old cultural tradition and with our Ho Chi Minh 
morality, the Vietnamese nation can feel proud of being a human 
nation. There is no need to recall faraway stories; our 
attitude toward the POW/MIA issue and the way we treated Puppet 
government employees and Puppet Army personnel in the past are 
enough to testify to this fact. 
  Those who once confronted the Vietnamese people on human 
rights and who now want to have a dialogue with us on human 
rights should think of the need to pay their human rights debts 
to the Vietnamese people if they regard themselves as civilized 
and thoughtful people. Having already failed in their attempts 
to confront the Vietnamese people on human rights, how can they 
be successful in their bid to use dialogue on human rights to 
subjugate the Vietnamese people? This is unacceptable and 
impractical.

<F P=106> [30 January QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article: "An Act Running </F>
Counter To The General Trend"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Senate voted on 26 January in favor of 
establishing a new radio station called Radio Free Asia, 
designed to direct broadcasts at Asian countries. 
  Many responsible U.S. officials said straightforwardly that 
the purpose of this radio is to propagate U.S. concepts and 
lifestyle to those Asian lands where freedom and democracy are 
absent. 
  The U.S. Senate decision has sparked immediate reactions 
from 
various Asian countries. On 27 January, a Chinese Goverment 
spokesman said that through its decision to set up Radio Free 
Asia, the United States has trampled on the standards of 
international relations and interfered in the internal affairs 
of China and other Asian countries. The spokesman also said: The 
U.S. Senate's 26 January decision must be cancelled. 
  KCNA -- the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY of the DPRK -- issued a 
statement condemning the U.S. decision to set up Radio Free Asia. 
  Myanmar also expressed its concern over this U.S. Senate 
decision. 
  Radio Free Asia is not the first instrument aimed at 
propagating the U.S. outlook and philosophy. Earlier, during the 
Cold War, the United States established Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty to direct broadcasts at European countries and 
former Soviet countries. Then came the recent establishment of 
the Jose Marti radio and television stations to beam broadcasts 
at Cuba. 
  One of the first directors of Radio Free Europe later 
revealed that the purpose of such radio stations was to create 
public insecurity and anarchic conditions for propaganda targets 
in the relevant countries. 
  These radio stations are important tools of the United 
States 
in its peaceful evolution strategy. Not only have relevant 
countries protested against such stations, they have also been 
condemned by the international community on several occasions. 
  After the Cold War, along with the general international 
development trend, Asia has emerged as a dynamic and 
fast-developing zone of peace and stability. Apart from pressing 
for peace, stability, and equal and mutually beneficial 
cooperation among regional countries, Asian countries want to 
expand their cooperative relations with all regions and nations 
on the basis of peace, stability, and mutual benefit, respect 
for independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in each 
other's internal affairs. 
  Aware of the prospects of Asia, many countries and regions, 
including Europe and even the United States, consider their 
cooperative relations with Asian countries important. 
  The Asian people believe that the U.S. Senate decision is a 
product of the Cold War period that runs counter to general 
trends in the Asian region, is detrimental to Asian 
socioeconomic development, and will have a bad effect on 
relations between the United States and many Asian countries. 
  According to a 29 January BBC dispatch, there has even been 
criticism in the United States against the plan to set up Radio 
Free Asia. Those who oppose this plan contend that this is a 
Cold War-style product which is no longer useful and suitable, 
especially when economic relations between the United States and 
Asia are increasing daily. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton and other top-ranking U.S. 
officials once declared that the United States would respect the 
sovereignty of other countries and their right to 
self-determination and that it would not interfere into the 
internal affairs of other countries. Regrettably, the U.S. 
Administration has reneged on its own words by infringing upon 
international law and interfered in the internal affairs of 
Asian countries. 
  It is hoped that the United States will make the correct 
decisions to suit the general trend of the world and the region.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 31 -- "The US Senate's decision to 
set up 'Radio Free Asia' completely runs counter to the trend 
for peace, stability and cooperation, violates international 
law, and blatantly interferes into Asian countries' internal 
affairs", says NHAN DAN paper in a commentary today. 
  The paper continues: 
  "Public opinions in Asian countries and even in the United 
States protest against the decision. Many people held that the 
setting up of 'Radio Free Asia' in the form of Cold War is no 
longer useful and suitable, especially when the economic 
relations between the US and Asia are increasing". 
  The paper recalls that spokespersons for the Foreign 
Ministries of Vietnam, China and Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea and Myanmar [Burma] have expressed their indignation 
against that move. 
  "Asia has emerged as a region of relative peace, stability, 
cooperation and dynamic development, the common aspiration of 
all nations in the region is to expand multilateral and 
diversified cooperation in order to defend peace, security and 
socio-economic development on the basis of mutual respect for 
independence and sovereignty, without interference into each 
other's affairs, and cooperation for equal benefit", the paper 
notes.

called on Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
  The Vietnamese leader welcomed the initial results of 
cooperation between Vietnam and GE in the field of healthcare. 
He informed the US businessmen of the development strategy in 
health-care and energy in the coming years and expressed his 
hope that GE, with its strength and as one of the leading US 
groups in cooperation with Vietnam, will expand its cooperation 
with and assistance to Vietnam, first of all in health care and 
energy. 
  GE President John Trani, for his part, introduced the prime 
minister the group's plan on cooperation in Vietnam, and 
expressed his hope that in 5 to 10 years to come Vietnam will be 
one of the big markets of GE. The president affirmed that the 
US Government's embargo against Vietnam does not effect the

a humanitarian issue. In the immediate time, GE will help 
Vietnam work out a number of healthcare development programmes, 
and build two major healthcare centres in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh 
City. As for energy field, Mr. Donald M. Kusza stated that GE

<F P=106> [Last part of article by Vu Oanh, party Political Bureau </F>
member: "Developing Combined Forces in Mass Motivation Work and 
Renovating the Work Content and Method of the Fatherland Front 
and Mass Organizations"] 
  [Text] Cadres working for mass organizations must get close 
to the people to understand them and create favorable conditions 
for the masses to understand among themselves so that they can 
sympathize and share their ups and downs, develop personal 
feelings to support one another, and provide needed 
encouragement and advice in life. Every citizen must be a mass 
motivation cadre to create a wide mass motivation network for 
the settlement of social issues that impossible for the law to 
cover all. We must form mutual assistance to support one 
another in production, life, crisis, and poverty. We must 
instill family and local traditions to mutually preserve our 
virtues and morality and to strive for more contributions to the 
government and the public. We have to negotiate and reconcile 
disagreements and disputes in the community to limit and reduce 
public grievances. 
  Party committees provide guidance to mass organizations by 
offering thoughts, conceptions, and directions but not orders. 
We understand that revolution is the people's undertaking, and 
revolution is creation. Living things are very diversified and 
continuously changing. Every party directive and resolution and 
state law must meet the people's aspiration. We also have to 
find out how much the people support party directives and 
resolutions in different localities. Therefore, the mass 
organizations must create favorable conditions to arouse and 
develop the public creativeness to match the diversified changes 
of things in life. Mass organization leaders will emerge and be 
selected from those vivid realities. Public movements will 
create new faces who will represent their aspirations and social 
classes. We must avoid subjectively appointing cadres who are 
not suitable to the mass motivation work. 
  The mass organizations' programs of action must be suitable 
to the people's daily activities. For example, if the local 
youths are producing ceramics for sale in the market, the Youth 
Union must outline its program to encourage ceramic production 
and inventions. It cannot introduce programs not relevant to the 
youths' daily activities. 
  What are the masses? What do they want? Why are 
cooperatives inefficient? Why do many people return to their 
old residence from new economic zones? The mass organizations 
must understand these issues, work out resolutions, and suggest 
corrections for better appropriate amendments to create 
favorable conditions for the development of the mass 
organizations. If the mass organizations are inflexible, 
domineering, and neglect the people's aspirations, the public 
movements will be limited and revolutionary achievements will be 
fewer. 
  2. Activities from one organization must be uniformly 
coordinated with other organizations. At the same time, the 
mass organizations must voluntarily carry particular tasks 
suitable to them. 
  The work of a mass organization and its ultimate goal are to 
bring benefits to the people, government, and society. 
Therefore, when a mass organization is doing a particular job, 
other organizations must help to bring about better results. 
For example, if the Peasants Association is implementing a 
program to introduce scientific technologies into rural areas 
without active participation of the Youth Union, Women's Union, 
War Veterans Association, and other professional associations, 
the results will not be high. The development of the family 
economy is also similar. Despite different family members 
joining different organizations and associations, they all 
contribute their efforts to improve the family economy. One 
particular organization alone cannot improve all families' 
economy, but all must join hands to help different members of 
all families to strongly improve their economies. 
  Mass organizations must aim at family units and members in 
their motivation work. A family has all the functions of race 
preservation, education, culture, society, convalescence, 
relaxation, living activity, production, and consumption. In 
future, children can receive their education at home. Teachers 
will teach them from afar via computers. The relations between 
school, family, teacher, and student will be different. 
Therefore, mass motivation must pay attention to the motivation 
in each family. 
  When carrying out any task in a community, a mass 
organization needs the guidance of local party committees and 
the participation of other organizations. To better coordinate 
among different mass organizations, their executive committees 
should include people who are also members of other mass 
organizations. For example, the peasants association executive 
committee should include people who also are leading cadres of 
the youth union, the women's union, the war veterans 
association, and vice versa. 
  On the other hand, public movements also have their own 
natural way of grouping based on professions. People in the 
same profession must correctly evaluate their group capacity and 
rightly chose their main tasks. Every professional group, 
depending on their function, duty, demand, and skill should 
voluntarily carry some major tasks of the common undertaking. 
This will eliminate overlapping, many organizations doing the 
same work, or nobody doing a particular task. We must respect 
the initiative of each organization and help unite all 
fatherland front activities to implement common socioeconomic 
duties. 
  Mass organizations must practically help members to improve 
knowledge, education, profession, and work experience; to solve 
difficulties in life; to meet their healthy demands and hobbies; 
and to actively partake in social activities. 
  The successful division and unification in different works 
among different fatherland fronts and mass organizations will 
create wide and practical public movements to improve the local 
economy and to settle social issues. Guidance for mass 
organizations must be continuous and uniform. We must avoid 
giving inconsistent guidance. And we must regularly review our 
work to draw more experiences in order to expand public 
movements. 
  Mass organizations must build practical programs of action. 
Then they must supervise the grassroots to implement closely the 
program. In these programs, we must define important tasks in 
each period and assign able cadres to execute and supervise 
them. We have to reduce the practice of sitting at our desks 
and managing by directives and reports. We must limit the 
issuance of resolutions and increase public contacts. 
Management must be done with planning, goals, and projects. 
Through the implementation process of a particular project, 
mass organizations will establish better connections with their 
grassroots and with their members's benefits and creative 
capacity. In carrying out goals, the mass organizations must 
establish regular professional, technical, and service contacts 
with related state organs to improve their funding, technical 
knowledge, training, and other activities. 
  Fatherland front and mass organizations must help to build 
strong local party organs and governments. They can contribute 
to party building through discussions of party draft documents 
in their local meetings and mass media. They should suggest 
what the party can supplement or how it can correct policies 
that are not quite meeting the people's legitimate interests. 
  Fatherland front and mass organizations motivate the public 
to implement the party's line and policies. At the same time, 
they must supervise their implementation. They offer comments 
on party leadership, guide the public to offer opinions on 
cadres and members, participate in selecting cadres, and educate 
good people to introduce to the party. At the same time, they 
must create favorable conditions to build localities all with 
good party members and strong party committees. Fatherland 
front and mass organizations must uncover party opportunists and 
degenerated elements. They must actively participate in 
anticorruption movements. They must take part in the process of 
correcting loopholes in structures and policies and uncover 
corruption and smuggling committed by party members. They can 
help the party eliminate bad people from its organization. 
  Fatherland front and mass organizations protect the party by 
pointing out distortions against its history and theory and 
activities to tarnish party members' reputations and the party's 
undertakings, thus significantly contributing to the victory of 
our revolutionary undertaking. 
  The front and other mass organizations must participate in 
administration building so it will become one that is of, by, 
and for the people. The front and other mass organizations must 
recommend candidates of good talents and ethics to the people 
for election to the National Assembly and people's councils. 
Meanwhile, they must act on behalf of the people, monitor, 
supervise, and create work conditions for members of the 
National Assembly, people's councils, and government officials. 
They must contribute to gradually perfecting the system of 
democratically-elected representatves and developing the 
people's democratic rights. 
  They must formulate and enforce regulations, participate in 
enacting laws, and draft resolutions and government decrees in 
an effective fashion. 
  They must cooperate with the administration to work out and 
enforce various production and trade policies and plans and 
various forms of activities at the infrastructure. They must 
supervise the execution of labor contracts and the enforcement 
of legislative policies and those policies to educate citizens. 
This will protect the interests of the laboring people in 
their economic activities. 
  We must formulate and promulgate documents of a legislative 
nature, seeing to it that all resolutions of the front and other 
mass organizations are welcome and complied with. 
  We must apply the system of disciplinary actions and 
dismissals against those government cadres and employees found 
violating the people's interests. On a periodic basis, the 
front and other mass organizations must come to hear government 
briefings on the actual situation of the country, on government 
measures now in force, and on state-governing policies and plans. 
  One of the important goals of mass motivation work is to 
provide additional training for the mass motivation contingent 
of cadres. Our work has left much to be desired for quite a long 
time now. Attention has not been given to the conduct of 
training and additional training for mass motivation cadres who 
have not been given proper assignments. Benefits for cadres are 
still constrained. Many are working without peace of mind. We 
must renovate and build the contingent of cadres to meet mass 
motivation requirements in the new stage. This is of great 
significance for mass motivation work and for the general cause. 
  Depending on each category of professional cadres, we must 
adopt a proper system of recruitment, employment, training, and 
additional training. We must adhere to professional standards 
to recruit for long-term assignments. We must strive to reduce 
their numbers while increasing the number of semi-professional 
cadres and personal advisors. We must make full use of 
professional cadres' abilities and knowledge for the service of 
mass organizations. We must have an incentive system for them 
and must attach importance to the recruitment of nonparty cadres. 
  We must adopt a system by which youth union members and 
youth 
association members can directly participate in the election of 
those who have grown up in the renovation process and in various 
movements and who are noted for their shrewdness and abilities 
to lead mass organizations. 
  Building operating funds is important to ensure that mass 
organizations can work independently and objectively. We must 
create conditions for cadres to associate with youth union 
members, youth association members, and the fundamental elements 
of their respective organizations. 
  Mass organizations must seek ways to obtain operating funds 
aside from the state budget with some contributions from youth 
association members. They must strive to provide additional 
allowances to cadres so they can have enough money to live on, 
care for their families, and buy things needed for their work. 
Attention must be paid to stepping up economic activities 
within the framework of the law. Mass organizations must 
participate in carrying out various state- and international 
organization-run projects such as the International Monetary 
Fund. Operating funds and working conditions are important 
things needed for cadres and mass organizations. The state and 
mass organizations concerned must formulate plans and measures 
to ensure these things. 
  The mass motivation task in the new stage is very heavy. 
Renovating the contents and mode of operations of various mass 
organizations are important to ensure good success for mass 
motivation work. We must observe Uncle Ho's teaching that "the 
people's force is very large and mass motivation is therefore 
very important. Poor performance in mass motivation will affect 
other activities. Conversely, good performance in mass 
motivation will lead to the success for other activities." 
Satisfactorily carrying out mass motivation work will ensure 
success for our cause of building a prosperous people, a 
powerful country, and an equal and civilized society.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 30. -- `The heavy industry sector 
has become geared to the market system', the minister of heavy 
industry Tran Lum said in a review of the results of the 
operation of state-run heavy industry in 1993. 
  This was the first time in three years the heavy industrial 
sector had exceeded its plan five per cent in its total turnover 
and seven per cent in its output value. The 1993 output value 
was 23 per cent higher than in 1992. 
  Worthy of note was the production of 1,300 machine tools, up 
by 52,6 per cent in comparison with 1992 241,000 tonnes of 
rolled steel, up by 23 per cent 21,700 electric motors, up by 57 
per cent nearly 700,000 tonnes of fertilizers, up by 32 per cent 
360,000 tonnes of apatite ore, up by 24 per cent, and 2,800 
electric transformers, up by 114 per cent. These products sold 
well in domestic markets. 
  According to economists, heavy industrial establishments 
have 
been able to survive while the country was switching to a market 
oriented economy because they knew how to combine the 
manufacture of their special products with consumer goods such 
as electric fans, detergents, paint, household electric cables, 
bicycle parts, batteries, and so on. 
  In some major mechanical engineering plants, their 
specialized products accounted for one-third of their output 
value, whereas consumer goods made up the remainder. 
  In addition, the industrial products met the requirement of 
buyers in the sectors of agricultural production, and food, farm 
product and sea product processing. 
  The heavy industry sector expects a growth rate for 1994 of 
10 per cent compared with 1993. 
  The ministry of heavy industry has outlined a programme to 
combine the development of heavy industry with agriculture to 
turn out products suitable to the country's climate, conditions 
and farming techniques. 
  To implement this programme, by the end 1993, the heavy 
industry sector put the Lao Cai Apatite Sorting Plant, with a 
designed capacity of 760,000 tonnes per year, on its first test 
run, and more investment in improving and expanding several 
establishments for rolled steel production.

  [Text] Asia currently has the highest economic growth rate 
in the world. The economic revolution is only beginning in 
Vietnam, however. Although it has only relatively recently 
opened up its markets, that country, with its 70 million 
inhabitants, has already achieved considerable successes. 
[passage omitted] 
  Financial institutions are responding to these prospects. 
Their interest in this geographic area was confirmed with the 
launch of a capital investment fund called "Vietnam Vest." This 
is a first in France. However, the Luxembourg fund does not 
seek to attract private investors; it is open only to 
institutional investors within the framework of a private 
placement. Moreover, it will not involve the constitution of a 
portfolio including companies quoted on the stock exchange. The 
fund seeks to help French, European, and Asian companies to 
penetrate the Vietnamese market by providing capital stock, 
either directly of through joint ventures. It targets companies 
operating in sectors with strong growth potential, such as the 
agro-food, light industry, corporate services, health, 
communications, and tourist sectors. The fund's role will not 
remain limited to that of capital supplier. The Saigon-based 
team managing the fund will also help companies exploring the 
market, providing assistance with their search for partners, 
their contacts with the Vietnamese authorities, and their actual 
establishment. 
  The fund seeks to collect Fr30 million by June. Initially, 
60 percent of its investments will go to joint ventures. In the 
second phase, it intends to acquire interests in recently 
created Vietnamese private companies, and to participate in the 
privatizations planned for the end of this year.

  [Text] The ROK Government has decided to collect rent from 
the United States for the use of the U.S. Embassy building for 
the last five years alone. The ROK Foreign, Finance, Defense, 
and Culture and Sports Ministries reached this decision at a 
joint meeting on 28 January. They also decided to hold 
consultations with the United States on this matter sooner or 
later. A ROK Government official said: "The government made 
such a decision because the period of prescription for rents 
stipulated in the Government Budget Account Law is five years." 
He also said: "The government decided to ask the United States 
to pay rent without fail if it continues to use the building." 
  The government made such a decision because the Board of 
Audit and Inspection last July pointed out that the "U.S. 
Government had not paid rent for the past 13 years with no 
justifiable reason." 
  The ROK and the United States agreed in 1960 that the United 
States would use the 6,615 square-meter eight-story building 
free of charge as long as the U.S. Operations Mission or its 
successor organization stays in the ROK." 
  However, the United States insists: The Economic Department 
of the U.S. Embassy inherited the role of the U.S. Agency for 
International Development to Korea, which was inaugurated as a 
result of the restructuring of the U.S. Operations Mission in 
1968 and which was abolished in 1980. Therefore, the U.S. 
Embassy has no reason to pay rent. Also, the 1962 agreement on 
the use of the building stipulates that the United States can 
use it free of charge as long as the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense 
Treaty exists. So, the United States has the right to continue 
to use the building free of charge.

<F P=106> [Article by Chong Pyong-chin: "The Improvement of Combat </F>
Capabilities of the U.S. Forces in the ROK--View of the ROK 
Foreign Ministry"] 
  [Text] Regarding the U.S. plans to improve the combat 
capabilities of the U.S. Forces in the ROK, the government has 
maintained that "this is something that the ROK and the United 
States have consulted for a long time." 
  It goes without saying that the buildup of the combat power 
of the U.S. Forces in the ROK is aimed at North Korea. 
Therefore, the fact that our government has agreed to improve 
the combat capabilities of the U.S. Forces in the ROK can be 
explained in two ways. First, the government has figured that 
it may be of use in putting psychological pressure on North 
Korea to once and for all come to an agreement with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency for the early settlement of 
the nuclear issue. Second, it is out of necessity to 
substantially prepare against a possible "crisis on the Korean 
peninsula" that may be caused when North Korea changes its 
system on its own. 
  The ROK and the United States have reportedly worked out 
such 
measures from the time North Korea declared its withdrawal from 
the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty and the U.S.-North Korean 
dialogue started. It was also learned that General Gary Luck, 
commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, pointed out problems in 
deploying reinforcements dispatched from the mainland for actual 
combat purposes in case a war breaks out and strongly requested 
the deployment of Patriot missiles late last year to break the 
brunt of the enemy's attack. 
  In connection with these moves, relevant government official 
on 27 January said "North Korea has recently shown signs of 
breaking the power balance on the Korean peninsula by developing 
Nodong-1 and -2 missiles." He added that "We think it is time to 
reexamine the defense system of the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces 
Command." Stressing that Patriot missiles are only defensive 
weapons, he went as far as saying that "the Patriot missiles 
deployed in the ROK will be for `display' unless North Korea 
launches Scud missiles toward the ROK." 
  Meanwhile, some in the Foreign Ministry hold that the rapid 
buildup of combat power of the U.S. Forces in the ROK, including 
the deployment of Patriot missiles, may provide a new excuse for 
North Korea to assume a hard-line stance on the nuclear issue. 
North Korea has, in fact, urged both the ROK and the United 
States to suspend the Team Spirit joint military exercise--a 
defensive exercise--maintaining that the exercise is aimed at 
attacking North Korea. Therefore, this may give North Korea 
enough room to persist that the recent "complementary measures 
for defense combat capabilities" of the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces 
Command also pose a threat to North Korea. 
  It is worth noticing that China expressed its position 
through its Foreign Ministry spokesman by commenting that "we do 
not approve a conduct that undermines stability and peace on the 
Korean peninsula." In addition, some go as far as pointing out 
that the recent decision on building up combat power stemmed 
from the U.S.' domestic problems. Their rationale is that there 
is no reason for the United States to strengthen the ROK-U.S. 
Combined Forces Command by provoking North Korea at a time when 
the nuclear issue seems to be finding its way out through 
dialogue. In other words, it may be an adroit strategy hatched 
by the U.S. Administration designed to eventually sell the U.S. 
Forces weapons to the ROK Army.

<F P=106> [Article by Yi Won-chae: "Improvement of the Combat </F>
Capabilities of the U.S. Forces in the ROK -- View of the ROK 
Defense Ministry"] 
  [Text] It has been reported recently that the United States 
plans to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopter 
battalions in the ROK and plans to relocate aircraft carriers to 
this region. The ROK Defense Ministry thinks that this would 
contribute to beefing up the combat capabilities of the U.S. 
Forces in the ROK. At the same time, it assumes a prudent 
attitude toward this issue. 
  The Defense Ministry is trying to minimize the importance of 
the report and says: "This plan is being carried out on a 
normal basis as part of the U.S. plan to modernize its forces in 
the ROK." 
  It says that the deployment of Patriot missiles in the ROK 
was decided at the 23d ROK-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting in 
October of 1991. Patriot missiles won a good reputation by 
intercepting Iraqi Scuds during the January 1991 Gulf war. 
After the war, the United States persistently asked the ROK to 
buy them. However, it decided to deploy them in the U.S. Forces 
in the ROK when the ROK concluded that they are not suitable to 
our geographical conditions. 
  The Defense Ministry anticipates Patriot missiles would be 
used to intercept MiG's in times of war because they are 
ground-to-air missiles and are capable of intercepting aircraft, 
even though the primary purpose of their deployment would be to 
intercept North Korean Nodong No. 1 missiles. 
  Military officials predict that they will be the latest 
generation of Patriot missiles whose capabilities to find 
targets and range have improved significantly and are capable of 
correctly intercepting and completely destroying enemy missiles' 
warheads in midair to minimize damage on the ground. 
  However, some military experts say the missiles may not 
prove 
efficient in the ROK because the battlefield depth is a mere 40 
km, the warning time for a North Korean attack is short, the 
missile's hit rate is a mere 50 to 60 percent, and because it is 
not appropriate to use the missiles in a populous area. They 
also say that 36 Patriot launchers are not enough to contain 
enemy air strikes because North Korea is expected to fly 
aircraft over 2,000 times a day in wartime. They also say the 
deployment of Patriot missiles is important in mitigating 
people's uneasiness over Nodong No. 1 missiles. 
  Military officials concerned also say replacing the Cobra 
helicopter unit with two Apache helicopter divisions is part of 
the 1989 ROK-U.S. joint defense capability improvement plan. 
  Apache attack helicopters annihilated Iraqi tank units 
during 
the Gulf war. The helicopters are armed with devices to 
automatically identify and pursue targets, with night firing 
devices, and (Hydra) 70-mm rockets. The two-seater Apache flies 
at 270 km an hour and weighs 9,525 kg. 
  The Defense Ministry says the deployment of aircraft 
carriers 
on the Korean peninsula is related to the decision made at the 
1993 ROK-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting to transfer the 
wartime operational command over the 7th U.S. Fleet to the 
commander of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command: In an 
emergency, aircraft carriers would be rapidly deployed to the 
Korean peninsula as part of the rapid deterrence forces concept. 
It is expected that the 7th Fleet's ultramodern aircraft 
carrier Carl Vinson (91,400 tonnes) and conventional aircraft 
carrier Independence (86,000 tonnes) would be deployed. 
  The Defense Ministry considers these U.S. deployment plans 
to 
be a carrot-and-stick strategy for its nuclear negotiations with 
North Korea because these plans were mapped out long ago and 
because there is nothing worrisome about North Korea's current 
military situation.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials published in Seoul vernacular newspapers 
on 29 January on the possible deployment of Patriot missiles to 
the ROK. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 
800-word editorial entitled "Patriot Is for Defensive Use." The 
editorial notes that "the Patriot missile is a defensive 
weapon," and that the use of such a weapon is "by no means to 
attack North Korea," but to prepare for a possible attack by 
offensive weapons, such as the Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 missiles, 
which North Korea is currently developing. The editorial views 
that "if the South side does not take any defensive measures at 
a time when North Korea is developing offensive weapons, it 
would be relinquishing our security." The editorial reports 
China expressed opposition to the plan of deploying the Patriot 
missiles by noting: "This is an act threatening security and 
peace on the Korean peninsula." The editorial goes on to note 
that our opposition party [Democratic Party of South Korea] said 
that the plan to deploy the Patriot missiles may provoke North 
Korea. The editorial criticizes the opposition party's remark, 
noting that the opposition party does not know which side is 
committing acts that threaten peace on the Korean peninsula. 
The editorial concludes: "If North Korea changes its position 
and gives up the development of offensive weapons, then the plan 
to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK will lose its 
justification." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 1 a 
500-word article by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok on 
the plan to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to 
the U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK and to send an aircraft 
carrier to the waters near the Korean peninsula. The article 
reports this is to "prepare for a possible threat by North Korea 
if the UN Security Council decides to apply economic sanctions 
against North Korea." The article quotes a Washington 
diplomatic source as stating that "this is part of a 
comprehensive operational plan to prepare for a possible state 
of emergency that may occur on the Korean peninsula." The 
article reports that a U.S. Defense Department spokesman 
confirmed that "the deployment of the Patriot missiles to the 
ROK is being promoted" and that "when a final decision is made, 
the U.S. Forces in the ROK will possess an improved model of the 
Patriot missile." The article notes it has been confirmed there 
are plans to deploy Apache helicopters to the ROK as part of the 
U.S. plan to modernize its weapons. The article concludes that 
the Patriot missiles will be deployed to Air Force bases in 
Pusan, Taegu, and Kunsan to serve as a strategic defensive base, 
rather than for the defense of the metropolitan area. 
  HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 2 publishes a 1,000-word 
article by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok on the true 
nature of the new moves by the United States regarding the 
security situation of the Korean peninsula. The article notes 
that diplomatic circles in Washington are showing interest in 
U.S. moves regarding the Korean peninsula. The article explains 
that the United States is a "super power" militarily, but it 
needs the approval of the people to use its power. adding that 
"the situation on the Korean peninsula is no exception." The 
article notes "what the United States truly wants is not to be 
prepared for a war, but to strengthen deterrent power to prevent 
the outbreak of a war." The article notes that such moves by 
the United States are a means to put the finishing touches on 
the negotiations regarding North Korea's nuclear issue. The 
article notes that we cannot overlook the fact that the ROK may 
be used as a major weapons market by the U.S. defense industry. 
The article reports: "There are rumors that core figures of 
the U.S. defense industry in Washington secretly visited the ROK 
and met with high-ranking officials to discuss the sale of the 
Patriots." The article notes that the recent moves of the U.S. 
military are an ultimatum to North Korea regarding the 
settlement of its nuclear issue and to confirm to Northeast 
Asian countries, including Japan and China, U.S. presence in 
this region. The article concludes: "Moves for the increase of 
U.S. capability in the ROK cannot by any means be limited to the 
Korean peninsula issue." 
  HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 800-word 
editorial entitled: "Unusual Atmosphere on the Korean 
Peninsula." The editorial notes "the ROK Government is 
remaining silent" about U.S. plans to deploy Patriot missiles 
and Apache helicopters and to send an aircraft carrier to the 
waters around the Korean peninsula in case of a possible 
military provocation on the South by North Korea. The editorial 
notes that the people are worried about this matter because "the 
United States and North Korea reached an agreement in principle 
regarding the nuclear issue late last year and that negotiations 
are under way between the International Atomic Energy Agency and 
North Korea on the method for inspection of North Korea's 
nuclear facilities." The editorial elaborates on the pros and 
cons of the United States increasing its capability. The 
editorial notes that the people are curious about "the concrete 
content of the proposal for the settlement of the nuclear issue 
as agreed upon between the United States and North Korea, its 
progress, the real reason for the United States to increase its 
capability in the ROK, and the nature of U.S.-ROK consultations 
at this time." The editorial urges the government to be clear 
about these matters and explain everything to the people. The 
editorial concludes: "How the situation develops and how 
rapidly changes are made on the Korean peninsula are directly 
related to our security, right to live, and interest." 
  The liberal TONG-A ILBO in Korean publishes on page 1 a 
900-word article on the issue of "deployment of ultramodern 
weapons for U.S. forces in the ROK." Noting this issue was 
revealed by the U.S. side first, the article emphasizes the ROK 
Government's "politico-military measures" regarding the issue. 
The article then reports the remark by a high-ranking 
security-related official on the report on the U.S. plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to the ROK that 
"this plan has been included in the equipment modernization 
program of the U.S. Forces in the ROK for three to five years." 
  Asked if the weapons buildup was an indication of a 
"military 
provocation" by North Korea, the official stated: "There is no 
abnormal situation we should cope with at present," adding, "the 
necessity of such pressing measures for nuclear negotiations 
with North Korea should be reviewed from a political and 
military standpoint." 
  Referring to remarks of military officials, the article 
notes 
that "the question of deploying weapons at this time may cause a 
lot of controversy." The article quotes a statement by 
government authorities that "the recent U.S. report on projected 
Patriot missiles deployment, on dispatch of a state intelligence 
support team to the ROK, and on introduction of Apache 
helicopters, has led to the impression of heightened `tensions' 
on the Korean peninsula. Thus, the government expressed its hope 
to the United States that the U.S. military authorities will 
refrain from leaking intelligence." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 1 
a 300-word article by Washington-based correspondent Kim 
Hak-sun. The article reports: "It was learned on 27 January that 
the U.S. Government is strongly hoping that the ROK Government 
will purchase Patriot missiles, which it is considering 
deploying on the Korean peninsula to counter Scud missile 
attacks by North Korea." The article noted that a diplomatic 
source in Washington observed that "the U.S. Government's plan 
to increase military power, including deployment of Apache 
helicopters in the ROK and dispatch of aircraft carriers to the 
coast of the Korean peninsula, is related to the weapons sale 
strategy of U.S. military industries toward the ROK." 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word 
editorial entitled "Is the Korean Peninsula Uneasy?" Noting that 
the report on the U.S. arms buildup plan on the Korean peninsula 
is arousing "a sense of vague uneasiness" instead of "a feeling 
of relief" regarding security, the editorial points out that the 
report on deployment of Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters 
and on the dispatch of aircraft carriers will "evoke a sense of 
military tension," and refers to the "general observation" that 
such measures are "means of diplomatic pressure" on North Korea 
to accept nuclear inspections. The editorial reports that while 
negotiations are under way, such measures may possibly "irritate 
North Korea" and cause a "negative influence" on the 
negotiations. 
  Stressing that "military issues should be advanced in 
secret," the editorial expresses misgivings that the disclosure 
of such plans might have "diplomatic and military purposes." 
Referring to an explanation by government authorities of the 
U.S. plan to deploy weapons, the editorial reports that the ROK 
Government has failed to "consult sufficiently" with the U.S. 
Government on reinforcement of U.S. forces in the ROK and that 
our government has been "dragged" into U.S. policy on "the 
military situation" on the Korean peninsula, rather than 
"positively coping with this situation." 
  The editorial calls on the government to give "a clear 
explanation on the true aspects" to the people and stresses that 
"concentration of ultramodern weapons on the Korean peninsula 
during an atmosphere of detente is not desirable."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Is the Korean Peninsula Really in Crisis?"] </F>
  [Text] The United States dispatched a state intelligence 
support team to the ROK to strengthen the capability of 
gathering intelligence on North Korea. Following this, it is 
planning to deploy Patriot missiles to U.S. forces in the ROK 
and to replace U.S. Cobra helicopters with ultramodern Apache 
helicopters. The United States also plans to send an aircraft 
carrier in case of an emergency. Thus, the sense of crisis on 
the Korean peninsula has recently been remarkably heightened in 
Washington. 
  As the United States and North Korea reached a basic 
agreement at the end of last year on the solution of the nuclear 
problem, the people believed that the crisis situation regarding 
the North Korean nuclear issue was moving toward pacification. 
The toughening of U.S. military measures have caused the people 
to worry that the North Korean nuclear issue will not be solved 
peacefully and U.S. military pressure will make the North Korean 
attitude even tougher, thus leading the situation to a 
catastrophe [paguk]. As we anticipated, North Korea on 28 
January denounced the projected deployment of Patriot missiles 
in the ROK as an "intolerable grave military challenge," and 
demanded immediate cancellation of the plan. 
  There are many varied reasons for intensified U.S. military 
measures, including the plan to deploy Patriot missiles. One is 
that the measures are intended to cope with an "unpredictable 
reaction" by the North Korean side in the event the UN Security 
Council imposes economic and military sanctions if nuclear 
inspection negotiations between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency are ruptured. Another is 
that the measures are aimed at pushing for nuclear inspection 
negotiations by pressing North Korea. 
  At this point, the people express worry about our 
government's attitude. When North Korea announced a statement 
of denunciation on 28 January, the government expressed concern 
to the U.S. Government about the atmosphere prevailing in 
Washington that tensions are heightened on the Korean peninsula. 
The government authorities said that "the deployment of Patriot 
missiles is still in the review stage after the commander of 
U.S. Forces in the ROK made the request to President Clinton 
late last year in order to supplement conventional fire power. 
The plan to introduce Apache helicopters was decided on a few 
years ago and will now be implemented." Thus, they explained 
that the measures were not taken to counter movement of the 
North Korean Army. The U.S. defense authorities also stated that 
the current measures have nothing to do with specific deployment 
of North Korean troops. 
  Then, we cannot but have a few questions. Why are the 
deployment of Patriot missiles, Apache helicopters, and an 
aircraft carrier being raised intensively at this very moment if 
it is true the North Korean Army is not making any abnormal 
moves? It was learned that Patriot missiles will be deployed to 
U.S. military bases in Pusan, Taegu, and Kunsan in consideration 
of the functions and firing range of North Korean missiles 
Nodong No. 1 and 2. Thus, it is noted that the Patriot missiles 
are not for the defense of the capital. The United States 
insists that as long as North Korea does not fire Nodong No.1 
and No.2 missiles at South Korea, the Patriot missiles deployed 
to the U.S. Army will be for defense purposes. What is an issue 
is that a U.S. Defense Department spokesman openly stated that 
"it is the intent of the U.S. Government to willingly sell 
Patriot missiles to the ROK." People pointed out that the 
Patriot missiles are not adequate for Korea in view of its 
mountainous terrain and that strong suspicions have been 
presented concerning its accuracy. We will have to bear great 
burdens if the United States turns over Patriot missiles and 
ultramodern helicopters to the ROK in the future. 
  Generally speaking, the strengthening of U.S. military 
measures against North Korea is not agreeable. In addition, our 
government's attitude of appearing to be controlled by the 
United States is deplorable. The government should take a firm, 
independent approach as the issue of peace on the Korean 
peninsula is ultimately related to the destiny of our nation.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 31 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang said Monday that neither military tension on the 
Korean peninsula nor North Korean military threats to the South 
has risen. 
  He told a luncheon meeting with journalists that the 
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea is still under 
consultation between Seoul and Washington. "It has not been 
decided," he said. 
  Yi said that recent reports on the deployment of U.S. Apache 
helicopters and an aircraft carrier in South Korea and on 
reinforcement of U.S. intelligence units here are not true or 
exaggeration of facts. 
  He also said that he plans to organize a committee with 16 
specialists in various fields to push ahead with inter- 
nationalization of the country. 
  "The committee will be divided into several subcommittees to 
study measures for internationalization," he said.

  [Text] The ROK and the United States plan to conduct the 
18th annual Team Spirit exercise in mid-March. The two countries 
will not, however, conduct the exercise if the North Korea 
nuclear issue is resolved before the exercise begins. They have 
also decided to immediately stop conducting the Team Spirit 
exercise even when they are in progress if North Korea takes 
"different" [pyonhwadoen] steps to accept the nuclear inspection 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  According to the Defense Ministry on 30 January, the ROK and 
the United States decided to conduct the Team Spirit exercise 
for approximately 10 days beginning in 10 March along with the 
field training exercise and the command post exercise. So far, 
it has been unclear whether they would conduct the Team Spirit 
exercise because North Korea has been uncertain regarding the 
IAEA's nuclear inspection. 
  Concerning the Team Spirit exercise, a relevant Defense 
Ministry official said that "the consistent policies of the ROK 
and U.S. Governments have been to conduct the Team Spirit 
exercise every year in order to strengthen the ROK-U.S. Combined 
Defense System and to raise the combat readiness of their 
forces." He also said that "the final decision whether they 
would conduct the exercise will be, however, determined by North 
Korea's attitude toward the IAEA inspection, which is now being 
discussed between the IAEA and North Korea." He added that 
"accordingly, this year's Team Spirit exercise will be fully 
suspended if North Korea accepts the nuclear inspection before 
25 February, the day the regular meeting of the IAEA Board of 
Governors ends." He added that "although the exercise continues 
through mid-March, it will be immediately suspended if the 
nuclear issue is resolved at that time." 
  The official said this decision was made after consulting 
with the U.S. Government. 
  Another relevant government official said that "it is true 
that we do not have enough time to prepare for the exercise 
because there are only 40 days left before mid-March, but there 
is no problem because we will conduct it by giving more 
consideration to the war games and the map exercise than to the 
field training exercise." 
  It was learned that, unlike the case of the Team Spirit 
exercise conducted last year, which mobilized 120,000 troops, 
including 50,000 U.S. soldiers, this year's Team Spirit exercise 
will mobilize a minimum of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea 
and the ROK Armed Forces and that, in particular, the field 
mobile exercises will be reduced to the minimum. The joint 
amphibious operations between the ROK and the U.S. naval forces, 
as well, will likely reduce their scope greatly by mobilizing 
only ROK forces.

  [Text] Because the resolution of the North Korean nuclear 
inspection issue has been delayed, our country and the United 
States have not made any decision on the Team Spirit exercise, 
which usually begins at the end of February each year. 
  Some people observe that North Korea is intentionally 
delaying negotiations with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] by considering the beginning time of the exercise. 
  In the event satisfactory progress is not made in nuclear 
inspection negotiations with North Korea, the Team Spirit 
exercise will be conducted -- even in the later part of the 
year. Yi Kang- tok reports: 
  [Begin Yi recording] A relevant government official revealed 
that if no progress is made in negotiations for solution of the 
North Korean nuclear issue, the Team Spirit exercise, which 
usually begins around February, may be conducted in autumn this 
year. 
  The official said that no concrete preparation for this 
year's Team Spirit have been initiated up to present, unlike 
other years. If a decision is made on conducting the exercise, 
it can possibly begin with only one month of preparations. 
Therefore, the observation that if the ROK and the United States 
fail to decide on conducting the Team Spirit by next month, this 
year's Team Spirit exercise would be spontaneously canceled is 
erroneous. 
  Some people recently viewed that as the Team Spirit exercise 
usually begins at end of February, the exercise will be not 
conducted after that period and the reason North Korea is 
delaying and not showing sincerity in nuclear inspection 
negotiations, is related to the time of conducting the exercise. 
  The official added that if North Korea is positive toward 
resolving the nuclear issue, including acceptance of IAEA 
inspections, suspension of the Team Spirit can be announced in 
accordance with the agreement between the United States and 
North Korea late last year. [end recording]

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 31 (YONHAP) -- Korean Ambassador to 
Washington Han Sung-su says he believes that the U.S. Government 
would not make a hasty decision on former presidential aide Kim 
Chong-hwi's application for permanent residency in the United 
States. 
  Han said on Sunday, however, he did not know the exact 
status 
of Kim Chong-hwi, former senior secretary for Foreign and 
National Security Affairs to President No Tae-u, in the United 
States. 
  Kim, wanted in South Korea on suspicion of accepting bribes 
in connection with the Yulgok military buildup program, was 
reported to have applied for permanent U.S. residency. 
  Han made the remark to reporters at Kimpo International 
Airport Sunday after he arrived from Washington to attend a 
conference of heads of diplomatic missions. 
  With regard to the North Korean nuclear problem Han said the 
issue will have to be referred to the U.N. Security Council if 
North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
fail to reach any agreement on IAEA inspection of North Korean 
nuclear facilities by Feb. 21. 
  Korean Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae, who also arrived 
for the conference on Sunday, said that the Seoul government has 
informed North Korea through China that Pyongyang has to allow 
IAEA inspection by Feb. 21 when the IAEA convenes a meeting of 
Board of Directors in Vienna. 
  "I have been meeting responsible Chinese officials from time 
to time to discuss problems aimed at resolving the North Korean 
nuclear problem," Hwang added. 
  On the planned visit to China by President Kim Yong-sam, 
Hwang said the date is tentatively set for late March and 
preparations for it are progressing smoothly, Hwang said. 
  Since President Kim is going to visit China as a state 
guest, 
he will be meeting his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin and other 
top Chinese leaders, he said. 
  Commenting on the establishment of air routes to China, 
Hwang 
said the two countries will first set up a regular air route 
between Seoul and Beijing before starting to negotiate for an 
air route between Seoul and Shanghai. 
  Hwang said he hoped the air route question will be resolved 
by the time President Kim visits China.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 29 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry on 
Saturday decided to return the two North Korean soldiers 
recently rescued in the West Sea to the North in accordance with 
their wish. 
  The two are Sfc. Kim Chol-chin, age 23, and Pvt. Kim 
Kyong-chol, 19, of a North Korean People's Constabulary Unit. 
  The duo were spotted and rescued unconscious on Jan. 27 
south 
of the West Sea extension of the Military Demarcation Line near 
Paengnyong-do Island while they were adrift in a tiny boat. 
  They were taken to the capital military hospital, where they 
expressed the hope to return to North Korea, a Ministry official 
said. 
  He said the two will be returned to North Korea through the 
Military Armistice Commission at Panmunjom inasmuch as they are 
military members and were rescued in an area under control of 
the United Nations Command in Korea. 
  The pair said they left their duty area at Ochasin-ri, 
Yongyon-kun, South Hwanghae Province, by small boat around 6 
p.m. Jan. 25 to collect fishnets set 50 meters off the coastline 
near their post. 
  But, they were swept away by a sudden gale and went adrift 
before being rescued by a South Korean Naval vessel one mile 
south of the sea boundary around 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 31 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is likely to 
accept IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspections of 
seven declared nuclear facilities and also agree to the 
inter-Korean exchange of special envoys sooner or later, a 
senior South Korean Government official said on Monday. 
  "Though there has been no tangible progress in North 
Korea-IAEA talks in Vienna, we believe North Korea will turn 
affirmative by the time the IAEA Board of Governors meeting 
opens on Feb. 21," he said. 
  The official observed that North Korea now seems trying to 
make most of the inspection issue as a valued "negotiation card" 
in the talks on the nuclear question. 
  He said that the question of inspecting two undeclared 
facilities at Yongbyon would be handled at third-round 
U.S.-North Korea high- level talks. 
  However, if the North Korea-IAEA talks fail, the February 
IAEA Board of Governors meeting would certainly declare that the 
safeguard continuance of the North Korean nuclear facilities was 
broken, in which event the nuclear question woud unavoidably be 
referred to the UN Security Council, he said.

<F P=106> [YONHAP from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] According to a Beijing source on 30 January, China 
has noted that North Korea has made political and economic 
changes since the sixth general meeting of the Ninth Supreme 
People's Assembly held in early December 1993. This source well 
versed in the situation of the Korean peninsula and Northeast 
Asia reported: China is paying special attention to the fact 
that North Korea has formed a new South Korean operation team in 
the Workers Party of Korea and appointed Kim Yong-chu, a 
moderate who had been excluded from power for almost 20 years; 
and Kim Tal-hyon, who recently retired from vice premier of the 
State Administration Council, as the top and assistant leaders 
of the team. China is saying that this shows North Korea's will 
to improve relations with Western countries. 
  This sources also said: China views that North Korea's 
agreement with China on a joint promotion to construct indirect 
social capitals in the Najin-Sonbong area and to enlarge and 
develop Chongjin Port forms a link in the chain of its long-term 
policy for opening up. 
  It has been learned that the Chinese view of the North 
Korean 
situation, in particular, was revealed in a classified document 
which was secretly circulated recently among ranking Chinese 
cadres in charge of party policy.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
plans to hold summit talks with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa in Tokyo on March 24 and with Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin in Beijing on March 28, South Korean Embassy and senior 
officials at the Japanese Government said Monday. 
  An embassy official said, "the South Korean Government is 
discussing ways to have summit talks with Japan and China on 
March 24 and 28, respectively. Since both countries are showing 
positive reactions to the South Korean proposal, the schedules 
are expected to be fixed soon." 
  For the proposed three day visit to Japan, President Kim is 
expected to have two meetings with Hosokawa and attend a banquet 
to be hosted by Emperor Akihito. 
  Kim also plans to deliver a speech on future-oriented 
relations between South Korea and Japan to the Diet, according 
to Japanese officials. 
  After visiting Japan, Kim plans to leave for China on March 
26 to have summit talks with Jiang and meet with other senior 
officials including Premier Li Peng. 
  South Korea is studying plans for President Kim to visit 
Shanghai and the Yanji autonomous region. 
  During his summit meetings in Japan and China, President Kim 
is expected to discuss the situation on the Korean peninsula and 
Northeast Asia including the North Korean nuclear problem and 
ways to promote cooperation in the fields of trade and economy 
with the two countries.

  [Text] It was learned on 30 January that the Defense 
Ministry has decided to purchase three additional German-made 
209-type submarines in the period between 1999 to 2001 at a cost 
of approximately 600 billion won. 
  The Defense Ministry's decision was made at the Navy's 
request. The Navy will have a total of nine submarines when 
these three submarines are introduced. The plan to purchase the 
additional submarines was confirmed recently and approved by the 
president. The Navy is planning to build the three submarines in 
the ROK in technological cooperation with the German maker HDW 
Company beginning this year. 
  It has been learned that the additional submarines to be 
purchased by the Navy will be equipped with more ultramodern 
electronic devices and stronger offensive weapons than those 
carried by existing 209-type submarines. A naval officer said on 
30 January: "The decision to purchase three additional 
submarines was made because it was determined that six 
submarines are not enough, considering the fact that North Korea 
has 25 submarines and neighboring countries, including Japan and 
China, also have strong submarine capability." 
  The Navy purchased three 209-type submarines at a cost 
ranging from 140 billion to 150 billion won each and is supposed 
to purchase three more by 1998. The additional submarines to be 
purchased by 2001 have a displacement of 1,200 tonnes, a surface 
speed of 14 knots, and eight 12-inch torpedo tubes. These 
submarines are considered to outperform North Korea's 
Whiskey-class and Romio-class submarines.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted on the T-72 tank's features] 
The ROK Government has purchased a T-72 tank from the East 
European bloc through (Epico) Co., a French arms dealing company 
that stirred up a controversial arms fraud case at the end of 
last year, to test its efficiency. This move is seen as part of 
the ROK Government's countermeasures against North Korea's 
possible selection of T-72 tanks as its main force, said U.S. 
intelligence sources. 
  Both the ROK and U.S. Armies think that North Korea deployed 
the tanks on the Western front of the Korean peninsula taking 
into account the hilly terrain of these areas. They are busy 
preparing for countermeasures because, if North Korea chooses 
these tanks as their main force, it would pose a great threat to 
the ROK. 
  The T-72 tanks were first introduced in 1977 and Syria was 
the first country to actually use them in warfare in 1982 during 
the war with Israel. Iraq used the tanks during the Gulf war in 
1991.

  [Text] PHNOM PENH, Jan 29 (AFP) -- Two powerful members of 
the secretive clique that controls Cambodia's radical Khmer 
Rouge have been purged since the signing of the country's peace 
accord in late 1991, a local newspaper said Saturday. 
  The bi-weekly PHNOM PENH POST said Ieng Sary, foreign 
minister during the radical faction's 1975-79 period in power 
and "brother number two" in the organisation, second only to the 
notorious Pol Pot, was ousted along with Son Sen, defence 
minister under the Khmer Rouge government. 
  They appear to have lost their posts in 1992, the newspaper 
said. 
  Ieng Sary had been at the centre of internal party friction 
for years, the newspaper said, while Son Sen had lost out after 
a debate on whether to take part in the UN peace plan for the 
country. 
  Ieng Sary lost his post as Khmer Rouge "minister of defence" 
in May 1992 after unsuccessfully arguing inside the faction that 
it should participate in the peace plan to gain international 
credibility, according to the paper. 
  He was overruled by hardliners who saw the peace plan, 
especially a provision calling for the disbandment of the Khmer 
Rouge army, as a ploy to strengthen the Phnom Penh government. 
  Son Sen had occupied one of the two Khmer Rouge seats on the 
Supreme National Council, the national reconciliation body set 
up under the Paris peace accord to embody Cambodian sovereignty 
until last April's elections were held. 
  Citing Khmer Rouge sources, the paper said Son Sen was 
expected to maintain some influence inside the Khmer Rouge but 
that Ieng Sary, after disputes with leader Pol Pot and other 
figures in the faction, had been forced completely outside the 
power structure. 
  The PHNOM PENH POST said Pol Pot, who went underground amid 
international condemnation after his government was accused of 
killing some one million Cambodian civilians during its time in 
power, was still firmly in control of the Phnom Penh [as 
received].

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Lambastes U.S. Plan To Set Up 'Radio Free </F>
Asia'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 31 (KCNA) -- The U.S. scheme to 
set up "Radio Free Asia" in East Asian region is apparently 
aimed at infringing upon the sovereignty of the Asian socialist 
countries including the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
and other nations, interfering in their internal affairs, 
bringing the wave of "liberalization" to those countries and 
gratifying its dominationist ambition, says NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The analyst says: 
  "Radio Free Asia" is a variant of the notorious "Radio Free 
Europe." 
  Through "Radio Free Asia," the United States intends to 
foster illusion about the West among the Asian people, 
contaminate their spirit and morality, plunge the society into 
confusion and disorder and thus stifle the socialist nations in 
this region as it did in Europe. 
  The U.S. ruling quarters want to have such an effect of 
"Radio Free Europe" in the Asian socialist countries including 
the DPRK and some other countries. Their attempt, however, 
stands little chance of success. 
  The decision of U.S. congress to fix a wave for the DPRK is 
an intolerable challenge to the high dignity and sovereignty of 
the DPRK. The United States, which has rendered the situation 
of the Korean peninsula strained with a hue and cry over 
"suspected nuclear development by North Korea," is now 
attempting to stifle the DPRK under the slogans "freedom," 
"democracy" and "human rights." This is nothing but a desperate 
bid of those scared by the might of Korean- style socialism. 
  It goes without saying that any false propaganda will have 
no 
effect in face of the iron will and faith of the Korean people 
who are determined to win the righteous fight against the enemy 
with the might of singlehearted unity, fully armed with the 
chuche idea, and nobody will lend an ear to the bourgeois 
propaganda.

  [Text] The Japanese Government is concerned about the 
announcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce that it will not 
change the United States' patent system to a first-to-file 
system. A Patent Office official said: "There is now a 
possibility that the global move toward the patent system 
harmonization will slow down." Member nations of the World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) want to enact a 
"Treaty for Harmonization of Patent Systems," which will unify 
patent systems into a first-to-file system. The Japanese 
Government in the Japan-U.S. framework talks intends to call on 
the U.S. Government to reconsider its stand. 
  The U.S. Government's patent system is the first-to-invent 
system, under which those who invent products first are given 
patent rights, instead of the first-to-file system under which 
those who apply first get the patent right. 
  During the Bush administration, a U.S. Department of 
Commerce 
advisory council recommended changing to the "first-to-file 
system." Given the circumstance, Patent Office officials 
complained: "It is regrettable that the recommendation was 
rejected."

  [Text] The Japanese Government is cool about the results 
on biddings for supercomputer procurement. A Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs [MOFA] official said: "Biddings are held 
fairly. The results merely reflect who are the competitive 
bidders." On the other hand, there are views that the results 
can bring considerably favorable effects on the whole course of 
the deadlocked Japan-U.S. framework talks because the 
governmental procurement biddings issue has been symbolic of 
frictions between Japan and the United States. 
  In 1990, the Japanese Government instituted the procurement 
procedures based on the principle of competitive bidding. A 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry official insisted: 
"Our procurement system treats Japanese and foreign bidders 
completely without discrimination. Therefore, there is no 
problem." Commenting on the results, a MOFA official said: "The 
fact is simple. Competitive bidders have won the bids." 
  Concerning the report that U.S. Cray Research Inc. is 
dissatisfied with the results, a MOFA official said: "The 
reason Cray won fewer computers than it had expected is not 
because there were problems in the procedures but because Cray 
lacked competitiveness." Meanwhile, another official criticized 
Cray's action, saying: "It is unfair to resort to political 
actions."

<F P=106> [By Ikuya Shigeta] </F>
  [Text] The focal points at issue at the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks have been narrowed down to two: whether 
Japan will be able to work out well-conceived plans for 
expanding domestic demands under the current political confusion 
and before the Japan-U.S. summit talks, and whether it will 
accept U.S. demands for setting numerical targets as part of the 
objective criteria to measure the degree of market access in 
such sectors as automobiles, auto parts, and government 
procurement. If Japan should fail to present drastic plans for 
expanding domestic demands, no accord will be reached at the 
framework talks, whose major theme is to cut Japan's current 
account surplus. Then, there will be considerably less 
significance in holding a summit. 
  Concerned with the deadlock at the framework talks, some 
domestic observers tend to hope that the summit will be 
postponed. However, the summit allows for no postponement 
because Japan must work out measures to stimulate its economy 
and to open up the market as an immediate task for overcoming 
its prolonged recession as soon as possible. Certainly, these 
measures should not be worked out for the sake of the United 
States. 
  In the sense that the Japanese Government must indicate its 
targets to the people, efforts must be made to carry out such 
tasks as the compilation of the draft budget as originally 
scheduled and before the summit. Deregulation efforts that are 
directly connected with market opening involve abolition of 
unreasonable standards and an authorization system as well as 
bidding system reform. Proposals for such efforts must be 
indicated to the United States in a positive way. 
  Hardly any progress can be noted at the talks on numerical 
targets, even at the general meeting at the vice ministerial 
level currently under way in Washington. 
  Japan and the United States may try to reach an agreement 
quickly in the future. However, in case Japan should make a 
political decision to accept numerical targets, there is a 
danger that foreign countries may come to share an understanding 
that the best way to win over Japan in trade talks is to bring 
the issues to talks at the top level. 
  When the current economic situation is taken into account, 
domestic industries, such as automakers, will lose confidence in 
promoting business recovery if such restrictions as future 
targets of procuring foreign products should be imposed on them. 
  Thus, Japan should insist on arguing that the United States 
is wrong in trying to introduce numerical targets. Japan should 
make further efforts to find a way to break the stiff stance 
taken by the United States by making positive proposals for 
opening up its markets that may also bring about benefits for 
its own people.

of talks with Malaysia on the disputed Sipadan and Ligitan 
Islands have achieved maximum progress even though a settlement 
has yet to be realized. 
  Izhar Ibrahim, the Indonesian delegation leader to the talks 
in Kuala Lumpur, expressed hope that the progress would pave the 
way toward the achievement of further progress in ensuing talks. 
No time frame has been set for the settlement of the dispute 
although the two parties agreed to hold further talks in Jakarta 
in four months' time. Apart from this, the two nations also 
agreed that the issue of Sipadan and Ligitan Islands settlement 
be based on the principles of international law.

  [Text] National Security Adviser Jose Almonte said 
yesterday the stalled peace talks between the government and 
various insurgent forces have been a cause of alarm for the 
Ramos administration but added that the government could not be 
faulted for the slow progress of the talks. 
  In an interview with Malacanang newsmen, Almonte admitted it 
was very difficult to give a time-frame for the conclusion of 
the peace negotiations with the communist rebels, Moro National 
Liberation Front (MNLF) and rightist rebel soldiers. 
  "It depends on several factors which are not within the 
control of the government," he said. 
  The exploratory talks between the government and the 
National 
Democratic Front (NDF) scheduled this month in Vietnam have been 
shelved anew because of certain conditions being demanded by NDF 
leader Jose Maria Sison which are unacceptable to the government. 
  The peace talks between the government and the MNLF have 
also 
bogged down because the government has rejected a demand of MNLF 
Chairman Nur Misuari that he be allowed to have 500 armed 
security men while attending the negotiations outside of his 
base in Sulu. 
  The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan [Nationalist 
Revolutionary Alliance] (RAM) led by former army Colonel 
Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan has been very critical over the lack 
of progress in the peace talks. 
  Almonte expressed the view that the various rebel groups 
will 
not go back to the hills to resume the fighting just because the 
peace process has been faltering. 
  The national security adviser said the basic reforms which 
the government has instituted has "pulled the rug from under the 
feet of the rebels." 
  "There was a pre-emption of the cause of the rebels," he 
said, stressing that the government's programs also reflect the 
cause of the rebels in many ways. 
  "Therefore, there is no reason for the rebels to continue 
fighting the government, in addition of course to the changes 
happening in the world," he said. 
  "Insofar as the socio-political framework is concerned, we 
could say that the nation is ready for the economic thrust as 
defined by the government," he added. 
  Almonte rated the restoration of social and political 
stability as one of the major accomplishments of the Ramos 
administration during the past 540 days. 
  He said the best indicator of stability is the fact that the 
various rebel groups are talking with the government about the 
peaceful resolution of the armed conflict. 
  Asked about his opinion on the current confrontations in the 
political arena, Almonte said these are indicative of a vibrant 
democratic process. 
  "We expect these activities. We should be worried when they 
no longer take place," he said.

  [Text] Three suspected Pakistani terrorists allegedly 
involved in the World Trade Centre bombing in New York last year 
are believed to be hiding in Thailand, police said yesterday. 
  Chief of the Second Sub-division of the Tourist Police, Pol 
Col Sanit Miphan, said the three suspects are wanted by the US 
government which has offered a reward of two million dollars for 
information leading to their arrest. 
  He said the Tourist Police Division has ordered its officers 
to be on the look out for the gang, who are also believed to 
have shot and killed two CIA agents last year. 
  Pol Col Sanit Miphan said he had received a report from a 
foreign source that the suspects might be in Thailand. 
  However, he refused to elaborate on the report because 
"police want to do their work quietly without attracting too 
much attention." 
  Photographs of the three terrorists have been circulated to 
tourist police both in Bangkok and in such provincial areas as 
Phatthaya where they might be lying low. 
  He identified the gang members as Mir Aimal Kansi (or Kasi), 
30, a suspect in the January 25, 1993 murder of two CIA 
employees in Virginia, Muhammad Faruq, 47, one of the suspects 
of the February 26, 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre that 
left six dead and injured 1,200. 
  The third suspect is Ramzi Ahmad Yousef, from Iraq or 
Kuwait,

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- U.S. President Bill Clinton 
congratulated Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday [31 
January] on his victory in getting political reform bills onto 
the statute books, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
said. In a 15-minute telephone conversation with Hosokawa, 
Clinton said the premier pushed through his reform legislation 
with courage and determination, the top government spokesman 
told a news conference. 
  The government's political reform package cleared the Diet 
on 
Saturday after Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party, reached a compromise on 
revising it in the regular Diet session, which opened Monday. 
  The reform package is intended to root out graft in Japanese 
politics through a new system for House of Representatives 
elections and stricter controls on campaign funds. 
  Clinton also told Hosokawa that they should both do their 
utmost to make a success of their summit in Washington on 
February 11, Takemura said. 
  The U.S. President reportedly voiced hope that Japan make 
efforts for progress in the bilateral framework trade talks and 
for additional pump-priming measures. The premier, who has 
twice met Clinton, replied he wants to demonstrate his 
leadership in tackling the issues, Takemura said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- The joint committee of both 
houses of the Diet approved Saturday [29 January] the compromise 
over political reform reached between Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
leader Yohei Kono. The joint Diet panel resumed deliberations 
on the final day of the current extraordinary Diet session. 
  It agreed that the government's original bills be put to a 
floor vote once again, but did not set a date for the 
implementation of the legislation at plenary sessions of the 
House of Representatives and the House of Councillors in line 
with the agreement between Hosokawa and Kono. 
  The electoral and political reform bills will be revised at 
the start of the next regular Diet session, which convenes 
Monday, incorporating amendment demands from the LDP, according 
to the agreement. 
  Hosokawa and Kono signed a 10-point agreement on the final 
shape of the four-bill package at a news conference after 
last-gasp negotiations over the package from Friday night to 
early Saturday. 
  Hosokawa had staked his political future on enactment by 
Saturday of necessary measures to revamp Japan's political 
system through electoral changes and tighter curbs on campaign 
funding. The agreement calls for replacing the present 511 
multiseat constituencies for the lower house with a mix of 300 
single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation 
seats. 
  The accord also provides one fund-raising group for each 
politician to receive donations from businesses and 
organizations. 
  "We agreed to resolve this issue in this manner in 
consideration of the state and the people," Hosokawa said at the 
joint news conference with Kono. 
  "I am filled with deep emotion," Hosokawa said about the way 
legislation had been concluded. 
  Kono, who signed the accord after Hosokawa, said they 
confirmed that the two are responsible for tackling 
international and domestic challenges now that the conclusion of 
the debate on long-delayed political reform is assured. 
  "We could not have reached the agreement without the spirit 
of concession," he said. "I am happy that we reached the 
accord." 
  Hosokawa noted that he had to make some painful decisions 
against the largest force in the coalition, the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP), in his talks with Kono. 
  While acknowledging that the revision amounts to a retreat 
from the government's original package, the premier noted the 
amended legislation would make the flow of corporate and 
organizational donations to individual politicians "more 
transparent, at least than under the current law." 
  The SDP had demanded that individual legislators be 
prohibited from receiving such money, which is seen as a root 
cause of rampant graft in Japanese politics. 
  Asked if the joint appearance before the press with his 
political archrival Kono will affect the framework of the ruling 
coalition, Hosokawa said, "Honestly, I cannot make any 
prediction." 
  Kono said a number of national challenges, including the 
bilateral trade talks with the United States and the sluggish 
economy, are critical to the quality of life in Japan, and he 
expressed the LDP's readiness to supply the coalition government 
with its expertise and manpower. 
  The LDP held the reins of government for 38 years until last 
August, when Hosokawa's coalition knocked the party from power. 
  Hosokawa said he and Kono concurred that there are numerous 
issues that cannot be resolved without making a "political 
truce" between the two factions.

  [Text] On the morning of 27 January, the U.S. Senate 
passed with a majority a resolution calling on President Clinton 
to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam to help resolve the 
fate of Americans missing from the Vietnam War. 
  The resolution was submitted by Democratic Senator John 
Kerry 
and Republican Senator John McCain. It was supported by 
senators who are war veterans to pass by a 62 to 38 vote margin. 
Afterwards, the Senate also voted 58 to 42 to reject another 
resolution submitted by Republican Senator Robert Smith 
requesting President Clinton to certify that the Vietnamese 
Government has provided the fullest possible accounting of 
missing Americans before the trade embargo can be lifted. 
  The debate before passing these two resolutions lasted six 
hours on 25 and 26 January. Democratic Senators John Kerry, 
John McCain, and Bob Kerrey stressed that Vietnam is doing its 
best to cooperate with the U.S. in locating missing Americans 
and the U.S. is in danger of losing this cooperation if it 
continues the trade embargo. Other supporters of lifting the 
trade embargo also cited U.S. military personnel working in 
Vietnam who say they are receiving cooperation which they are 
sure will continue with the lifting of the embargo. 
  Senator John McCain also stated that U.S. military personnel 
were working side by side with Vietnamese soldiers to locate 
missing Americans. The cooperation may be terminated if the 
U.S. does not show good cooperation. Senator John Kerry 
believes that the Senate's action will lead to more information 
on missing soldiers and help to close a bitter chapter in 
American history. 
  The senators supporting the resolution calling for lifting 
the trade embargo against Vietnam held that such an action is in 
the best interests of the U.S. as well as Vietnam.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Han Sung-su, ROK ambassador to the </F>
United States, by Washington correspondent Nam Chan-sun at the 
ROK Embassy in Washington on 27 January] 
  [Text] [Nam Chan-sun] Last year, the United States and 
North Korea held two high-level talks and 18 working-level 
contacts in New York. Many people point out that in reality the 
ROK was left out of the process of such negotiations... 
  [Han Sung-su] It is a pity that I cannot disclose the 
contents of the cooperation agreed upon between the ROK and the 
United States. The ROK and the United States discussed in 
advance the wording of the statement announced as a result of 
the two high-level talks between the United States and North 
Korea last year. We also took countermeasures and did analytic 
work with the State Department before and after every New York 
contact. [end Han] 
  However, sometimes there seem to be questionable aspects in 
this cooperative system. The first Vienna contact held early 
this month between North Korea and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] is being considered as a unilateral 
decision made by the United States with North Korea. After the 
29 December contact, the final New York contact for 1993, the 
ROK Embassy revealed that there would be a contact between North 
Korea and the IAEA after one or two working-level contacts in 
New York in the beginning of the new year. However, at its 5 
January regular briefing, the State Department revealed that the 
working-level contacts in New York had ended for the time being. 
Since then, there was a telephone contact between North Korea 
and the United States, and the ROK Embassy confirmed such a U.S. 
contact after the 5 January State Department briefing. 
  Regarding this matter, Ambassador Han said that there might 
be differences between the two countries in marginal matters, 
but since they are in complete agreement with the fact that 
North Korea must not develop nuclear weapons, differences in 
marginal matters cannot be regarded as a problem. 
  [Nam] Last November, President Clinton revealed that he will 
by no means allow North Korea to "develop" nuclear weapons. 
However, since then, there were rumors that North Korea may 
already possess nuclear weapons. In this connection, government 
sources are saying that the remark made by President Clinton in 
November is being explained as "work is being carried out so 
that North Korea cannot become a nuclear power." 
  [Han] President Clinton's strategic plan to move away from 
the Cold War is basically one to free mankind from the terror of 
nuclear weapons, including the extension until next year of the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This must be explained from a 
broad point of view in that existing nuclear weapons must be 
reduced and also that work must be carried out so that nuclear 
weapons can no longer be produced. On whether North Korea 
possesses nuclear weapons, some people say that "it might 
possess nuclear weapons," and some other people say that "it 
might not possess nuclear weapons." This itself is ambiguous, 
but I do not think that North Korea completely possesses the 
special technology needed to develop nuclear weapons. 
  [Nam] Nevertheless, policies must be mapped out to be 
prepared in case North Korea does possess nuclear bombs. Do you 
not think that all policies at this time are being made under 
the premise that North Korea does not possess nuclear bombs? 
  [Han] The common goal of the ROK and the United States is to 
achieve denuclearization, whether North Korea possesses nuclear 
bombs or not. All negotiations and policies will be regulated 
in accordance with that goal and according to the situation. 
[end Han] 
  Many Americans strongly criticized the United States because 
it might have made a conditional capitulation in the nuclear 
negotiations with North Korea. Ambassador Han, however, was 
confident that this will not greatly change the U.S. 
Administration's existing policy toward North Korea. 
  [Han] Hard-liners and moderates can exist anywhere. It seems 
that hard-liners and conservatives, in particular, are saying 
that the United States made conditional capitulation. However, 
if the IAEA proclaims that the continuity of the nuclear 
safeguards has been broken, there will be no objection to the 
fact that this issue will unconditionally be handed over to the 
United Nations, regardless of the hard-liners and soft-liners. 
Currently, the IAEA is only saying that the safeguards have 
been damaged. It has not said whether they have been broken yet. 
Therefore, all diplomatic means are currently mobilized to 
find out the truth. 
  [Nam] Let us go into details. Some media organizations 
recently reported that North Korea decided to receive only one 
round of inspection, and hawks-conservatives interpreted North 
Korea's alleged acceptance of one round of inspection to be its 
surrender. 
  [Han] This problem arose when THE NEW YORK TIMES once 
carried 
a report on an "agreement on one round of inspection." This is 
an incorrect report. The newspaper carried an incorrect report 
because another reporter wrote it while the reporter in charge 
of the nuclear issue was traveling in the Far East. When this 
report was carried, Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
personally instructed Undersecretary Lynn Davis to do something 
about the incorrect report. Undersecretary Davis gave a news 
conference three hours after it was published. At that time, he 
made it clear that nuclear safeguards must be maintained not on 
a one-time basis, that the continuity of safeguards must be 
ensured, that the United States would present this matter to the 
United Nations anytime the continuity is not ensured. [end Han] 
  However, most of the reports on nuclear negotiations between 
North Korea and the United States by THE NEW YORK TIMES or THE 
WASHINGTON POST have proven to be correct. Meanwhile, ROK 
newspapers generally quote those newspapers. 
  [Nam] The ROK Embassy in the United States should inform 
domestic newspapers of the details of the negotiations to a 
certain extent, should it not? The U.S. Department of State 
leaks information to THE NEW YORK TIMES and other media 
organizations. Our government agencies merely keep silent. 
  [Han] The Department of State and we agreed at first to 
withhold the details of the negotiations from public 
circulation. However, THE WASHINGTON POST and THE NEW YORK TIMES 
carried a correct report or two. So, I called high-ranking 
State Department officials. I protested to them, saying, "We 
are very much embarrassed by the fact that U.S. newspapers 
reported details of the negotiations." After that, the United 
States and we agreed to merely confirm whether contacts take 
place in New York and keep silent about the details of the 
negotiations. Because the U.S. Administration has kept silent 
about the New York contacts, U.S. reporters have even called me. 
[end Han] 
  Ambassador Han said: There are many think tanks and research 
institutes in Washington, and many of the people working in 
those institutes are former government officials. Therefore, 
those people have leaked information to media organizations on 
many occasions. For example, a State Department official may 
leak information when he receives a call from his former boss. 
  [Nam] How will the North Korea-U.S. contacts in New York 
proceed? 
  [Han] I think New York contacts are a useful venue for 
discussing a third round of high-level talks between the United 
States and North Korea. North Korea seems to think New York is 
a good place for such contacts because it is easy to communicate 
with Pyongyang from its UN Mission in New York, and the State 
Department, too, thinks New York is convenient because it is not 
far away from Washington. All channels of contacts other than 
New York contacts have now been closed. I think the United 
States and North Korea will use the New York channel for the 
time being. 
  [Nam] What is going on with the North Korean nuclear issue 
now? 
  [Han] Agreement has been reached on general principles. 
However, no agreement has been reached on the details. An 
agreement on nuclear inspection between North Korea and the IAEA 
is merely one of the prerequisites for resolving the nuclear 
issue. North-South dialogue, another prerequisite, must take 
place soon. Holding North-South working-level contact for the 
exchange of special envoys is not sufficient. That is a mere 
preliminary step. The most important thing is finding a better 
way to resolve the nuclear issue. North-South exchange of 
special envoys must take place. [end Han] 
  Ambassador Han, an economic expert, said: "Compared to 
conflicts in the economic negotiations, the two countries [the 
United States and the ROK] have virtually no conflict in the 
negotiations on security affairs between the State and Defense 
Departments and the ROK counterparts." However, it seemed to be 
clear that given last year's experiences, a consensus of views 
or close cooperation is far from true as far as the resolution 
of the North Korean nuclear issue itself is concerned.

  [Text] PHNOM PENH, Jan 31 (AFP) -- Cambodian co-premier Hun 
Sen announced Monday that the government was taking steps to 
curb the country's escalating crime wave and admitted that 
security officials were partly to blame. 
  Aid-relief agencies have threatened to pull out of the 
war-ravaged country because of continued attacks against their 
personnel and equipment. 
  "There are some crimes which are carried out by the forces 
of 
the royal government, we do not shy away from informing you 
about the truth of this," Hun Sen told an audience of aid agency 
and diplomatic officials. 
  The co-premier said he called the meeting after he and 
fellow 
co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh received a letter from aid 
organisation representatives voicing concern over highway 
holdups and the theft of vehicles. "I would like to take this 
opportunity on behalf of his royal highness Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh to appeal to you to understand the situation in 
Cambodia and not to stop aid to Cambodia," he said. 
  Aid officials said they welcomed the fact that the 
government 
was paying attention to the problem but complained that the 
co-premier did not offer any real concrete measures to improve 
the overall situation. 
  "I didn't see anything specifically new coming out of this. 
I 
can't say that it was really encouraging," one official said. 
  Hun Sen said the audience was rightfully concerned about an 
incident on January 13, when four of 11 bandits who stole two 
all-terrain vehicles belonging to the United Nations Development 
Programme turned out to be bodyguards for high-ranking leaders. 
  Two bodyguards were shot dead by police at the scene and two 
were captured later, Hun Sen said. 
  One of the dead had acted as a barber for senior party 
officials and "gave me a haircut on Janaury 11," Hun Sen said. 
But just because their bodyguards committed crimes does not 
mean the senior leaders were also involved, Hun Sen said. 
  In response to charges from the aid community that the 
military was often involved in highway extortion and robbery, 
Hun Sen said it was easy for anyone to buy military uniforms in 
the marketplace. 
  "But that does not mean that the government does not have 
bad 
forces, within every thousand there is one bad," he said. 
However, he said, if all government forces were withdrawn it 
would leave the roads open to attacks and robberies by the Khmer 
Rouge. 
  The co-premiers, in conjunction with the ministries of 
defence and interior, were taking measures to improve the 
situation in the countryside, Hun Sen said. But he said the 
government was caught between the problem of security and that 
of the Khmer Rouge. 
  He said police were aware of illegal weapons in some houses, 
but they did not take action because of concerns about 
"violating human rights." 
  Similarly, the police knew the identities of some criminals 
but had to wait to catch them in the act. 
  "This is the difficulty faced by the government. The 
government has become a buffer zone between criminals and human 
rights," Hun Sen said. 
  The co-premier, however, said he thought the problem could 
be 
brought under control. 
  He advised embassies and aid agencies to check with police 
before hiring local staff to ensure they had no criminal records 
and also suggested they advise appropriate authorities of their 
plans before travelling in the countryside. The ministry of 
interior could also provide bodyguards, Hun Sen said. 
  "Rest assured, the ministry will select good forces for 
you," 
he said.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 31 January, yesterday, Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, received His 
Excellency [H.E.] (Howard Balloch), assistant of the Canadian 
minister of foreign affairs and foreign trade, for talks. 
  Prince Krompreah thanked Canada profoundly for its attention 
and assistance to Cambodia regarding the Geneva conference, the 
Paris peace agreement, and mine clearing. Furthermore, Prince 
Krompreah proposed that Canada assist in building hydropower 
dams, communications, and power plants; and in giving 
professional training to the Khmer Royal Armed Forces. He also 
suggested that Canada send businessmen to invest in Cambodia. 
  H.E. (Howard Balloch) disclosed that Canada will continue to 
provide more assistance in clearing mines in Cambodia. As for 
other proposals put forward by Prince Krompreah, he said he will 
convey them to the Canadian Government so that the latter can 
assist in these matters.

<F P=106> ["Rejection" issued by the spokesman for the National Army </F>
of Democratic Kampuchea on 31 January; place not given] 
  [Text] I. Because of their difficult, desperate, and 
defeated position, (?the puppets) have spread a premeditated 
rumor that the wife of a high-ranking commander in the National 
Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] was killed during fighting 
in Anlung Veng and that this high-ranking commander then fled to 
Takeo Province. 
  We would like to confirm that the Vietnamese communist 
puppets' aggressive attack forces are very far away from Anglung 
Veng. As a matter of fact, the aggressive attack forces 
stationed in the eastern part of Samraong are over 50 km away 
from Anlung Veng; those in the area north of Sre Noy are over 80 
km away; and those in Kulen are over 100 km away. Elsewhere, 
the Vietnamese communist puppets' aggressive attack forces are 
under attack and are pinned down by the NADK and the Cambodian 
people. 
  II. This is a despicable lie on the part of the Vietnamese 
communists, their puppets, and their alliance. They are bogged 
down in the military, political, diplomatic, and social fields 
-- both in the countryside and in Phnom Penh. This is an 
attempt by our enemies -- who are facing an impasse and are 
suffering serious defeats -- to fool others. 
  The purpose of this psychological propaganda is: To threaten 
and frighten those who seek business contacts with Democratic 
Kampuchea [DK] in this zone; and to encourage the Vietnamese 
communist ringleaders and their troops, who are being routed and 
demoralized on every battlefields across the country, especially 
the Samraong-Anlung Veng battlefield. 
  But this self-deceiving propaganda by the Vietnamese 
communists, their puppets, and their alliance cannot encourage 
the Vietnamese communist puppet commanders and their troops. On 
the battlefield, the aggressive attack forces that launched 
operations against the DK's liberated zone were counterattacked 
during January by the NADK and the Cambodian people. They 
suffered heavy defeats: Over 400 of them were killed or 
wounded; over 700 others deserted; and 36 tanks, armored 
personnel carriers, and military trucks (?were seized). The 
Vietnamese communist puppets' aggressive attack forces are 
currently being smashed to pieces by the NADK and the people 
[words indistinct]. Under these circumstances, these savage 
elements are suffering from a shortage of food, ammunition, 
[words indistinct]. 
  III. During the January fighting, dozens of the Vietnamese 
communist puppets' military commanders were killed or wounded. 
These included over 30 commanders between the rank of colonel 
and first lieutenant as well as six generals. 
  General Prum Samen of the Vietnamese communist puppets' 
General Staff was seriously wounded and his tank was totally 
destroyed by a mine explosion east of Samraong. Gen. Nhoek 
Bunchhai, first deputy chief of the Vietnamese communist 
puppets' General Staff, was wounded during the fighting in 
Samraong on (?24) January. On 25 January, Gen. Long Sopheap, 
chief of the Vietnamese communist puppets' 4th Military Region, 
was seriously wounded as his tank was moving from Ba Noem to 
Samraong. He was quickly sent to a hospital by helicopter. 
  To summarize, the situation on Route 68 -- covering 
Samraong, 
Siem Reap, Anlung Veng, Kulen, Choam Khsan, Rumchong, and Ampil 
Districts -- shows that the puppets are suffering serious and 
successive defeats on this battlefield. It shows that the 
puppet commanders and their troops are being encircled; cut off 
from each other; and cut off from their supplies of food, [word 
indistinct] and assistance from the outside. They are in a 
serious state of desperation, and are waiting only for their 
doom. 
  [Dated] 31 January 1994

  [Text] The large-scale offensive by the Vietnamese 
communist puppets -- under the command of the Vietnamese 
communists -- and their alliance suffered total defeat on 31 
January 1994. 
  1. The large-scale offensive by the Vietnamese communists 
and their alliance began on 1 January in an attempt to open up 
the Route 69 battlefield and head toward Anlung Veng from 
Samraong, Sre Noy, and Kulen. The puppet forces mobilized 70 
percent of their forces from all over the country to concentrate 
on this battlefield. Ninety percent of the puppet commanders 
were sent to direct the fight on this battlefield. 
  2. Very tense and fierce fighting has been underway on 
this battlefield for a full month. 
  3. On 31 January, the National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea [NADK] and the people attacked and totally smashed 
this large-scale campaign launched by the Vietnamese communist 
puppets, under the command of the Vietnamese communists; their 
alliance; and the two-headed government. 
  4. On 31 January, the NADK and the people captured four 
tanks, two armored personnel carriers, and six military trucks 
in an area east of Bak Nim after these vehicles stumbled into an 
ambush by the NADK and the people. The NADK and the people 
captured three other tanks and three military trucks east of Sre 
Noy. They killed over 100 enemy troops and wounded over 100 
more. Several hundred survivors have retreated.

<F P=106> [PASASON Editorial 1 February: "We Wish the Thai </F>
Parliamentary Delegation Glorious Success in Its Visit to the 
Lao People's Democratic Republic"] 
  [Text] Today, in response to an invitation of His 
Excellency [H.E.] Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National 
Assembly of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], a 
delegation of the Thai Parliament led by H.E. Professor Marut 
Bunnak, speaker of the House of Representatives and president of 
the Parliament of the Kingdom of Thailand, has arrived in 
Vientiane for an official friendship visit to our country. The 
visit is scheduled to take place from 1 to 3 February. On this 
glorious occasion, residents of Vientiane as well as the 
multiethnic Lao people throughout the country, together with 
leaders and all members of the National Assembly of the LPDR, 
would like to welcome the parliamentary delegation of the 
Kingdom of Thailand and extend it their warmest salutations. 
The Lao people are also elated and highly honored to have an 
opportunity to welcome the high-level state guests of the 
parliament of a neighboring country, who have brought with them 
to the Vientiane residents and all the multiethnic Lao people 
the spirit of solidarity and neighborliness of the Thai people. 
  The peoples of Laos and Thailand are neighboring peoples who 
have maintained the traditions of fraternal affection and 
solidarity since ancient times. The two peoples have adhered to 
a similar, fine culture and customs. They can also understand 
each other's language without having to resort to interpreters. 
With these fine traditions of relations, though there have been 
certain difficulties and occasional disputes over the border 
issue in the past, the two sides have successfully settled the 
difficulties and disputes on the basis of the spirit of 
fraternity and respect for each other's independence and 
sovereignty. They have together continued to systematically 
settle the remaining problems based on the principles of 
international law and the concrete benefits for the two peoples 
and countries. 
  Based on the aforesaid spirit, the relations between the two 
countries have been developed in many respects: for example, in 
the economic field. Over recent years, especially following the 
implementation of the policy of building a market-oriented 
economy and broadening the economic cooperation with foreign 
countries, relations and cooperation in various fields -- as, 
for example, in investment for doing business with Thailand -- 
have been rapidly expanded. At present, most investors making 
investments in Laos are from Thailand. The exchanges of trade 
and the visits between the Lao and Thai peoples, in particular 
the legal economic activities carried out along the border areas 
of the two countries, have significantly contributed to building 
and developing the countries and improving the living conditions 
of the two peoples with each passing day. All these have served 
as favorable conditions for the peoples of the two countries to 
achieve mutual understanding, as well as to check and smash 
schemes and acts of ill-intentioned elements, who have intended 
to disrupt and sabotage the Lao-Thai relations, in order to 
create a good atmosphere for the opening of the Mekong bridge -- 
the first Lao-Thai friendship bridge -- scheduled to be held in 
April this year. 
  During the visit to the LPDR on this occasion, H.E. Prof. 
Marut Bunnak and his parliamentary delegation of the Kingdom of 
Thailand will pay courtesy calls on H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, 
president of state, and H.E. Khamtai Siphandon, prime minister 
of the LPDR. Noteworthy is that the Thai parliamentary 
delegation will also hold talks with a LPDR National Assembly 
delegation to discuss ways of increasingly promoting and 
expanding the existing bilateral relations and cooperation. 
H.E. Prof. Marut Bunnak and his delegation are also scheduled 
to visit various cultural places, including the Phakeo Buddha 
and the That Louang Pagoda temples, and a number of economic 
establishments in Vientiane municipality. 
  Our Vientiane residents, as well as all multiethnic Lao 
people throughout the country, wish the Thai parliamentary 
delegation glorious success in the official friendship visit to 
the LPDR on this occasion in order to significantly contribute 
to strengthening the fraternal solidarity and friendship between 
the two peoples of Laos and Thailand and enhancing relations and 
cooperation in the economic field between the two countries as 
well as in the legislative field between the National Assembly 
of the LPDR and the Parliament of the Kingdom of Thailand. May 
the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the National 
Assembly of the LPDR and the Parliament of the Kingdom of 
Thailand be increasingly developed and strengthened!

  [Text] Two groups from the Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB] have 
bombed the main offices of the nation's three leading oil 
companies -- Petron and Shell in Makati, and Caltex-Philippines 
in Manila -- almost simultaneously. After the incident, the ABB 
called a radio station to claim responsibility for the bombings. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Noel Perfecto] First, the 
terrorists bombed Petron's main office in Makati at 6:15 AM this 
morning. The security guard on duty was slightly injured in the 
blast. Police said that the blast did not cause serious damage 
to the Petron building, but damaged some windows in the adjacent 
Mandarin Oriental Hotel building. Five minutes later, the ABB 
bombed Shell House on Paleros Street in Legaspi Village. There 
was not much damage from the explosion, because the bomb fell in 
front of the powerhouse. 
  Makati Chief Remy Macaspar said that the bombs used were 
strong enough to kill people and damage property: 
  [Macaspar, in English] Regional Director General Sarmiento 
ordered to intensify our intelligence efforts as well as 
repressive patrolling, such that last evening he was also out 
there in the field. He really checked the prevailing situation. 
We concentrated on gasoline stations, but with this development 
we have to consider everything now. 
  [Perfecto] According to reports, the bombing of 
Caltex-Philippines in Manila came five minutes after the bombing 
of Shell House. Colonel Macaspar disclosed that police had 
brought the driver of the taxi used by the bombers in for 
questioning. The driver was identified as Abunjon Dabat. He 
said that he was forced out of the taxi after the bombings were 
completed: 
  [Dabat] Before making a U-turn into the Mandarin Hotel, he 
told me to pull over in front of the Petron Building. Then he 
said that he was going to get out and drop something off. When 
he got out of the taxi cab, I saw him holding something round. 
Then he lit it and hurled it at Petron's door. Then he 
returned to the cab and I started driving again. He told me to 
turn right at Paseo Roxas and right again at Citibank. When we 
were at the corner near Citibank, he told me to stop because he 
was going to throw something again. That is what he said. 
  [Perfecto] Shell House's security guard, identified as 
Rogelio Valdes, said that the bombers appeared to be youths. 
  Is this what the object that was thrown at your building 
looked like? [video shows Perfecto holding several sticks of 
dynamite wired together] 
  [Valdes] Yes. It looked like this, but it was wrapped in 
brown paper. 
  [Perfecto] Do you think there were also as many sticks as 
this? 
  [Valdes] Yes. I think there were as many sticks as that, 
because it was as big as that. 
  [Perfecto] But you did not notice that they were using a 
taxi? 
  [Valdes] No. I did not notice whether the taxi that passed 
by my post was the one that the bombers used. 
  [Perfecto] As of air time, the Capcom [Capital Command] had 
alerted all of its centers and placed a tight guard on all vital 
government offices and buildings that are potential bombing 
targets. [end recording] 
  In a related development, strict security measures are being 
implemented at the Energy Regulatory Board [ERB] and Land 
Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. The ERB office 
received a bomb threat after the bombing of the three oil firms' 
offices. Strict security is also being enforced at the offices 
of the National Power Corporation and the Metropolitan 
Waterworks and Sewer System. Meanwhile, the Philippine National 
Police call on the public to support the security measures that 
will be put into place at all sensitive government offices and 
some private companies.

  [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Chaloemphon Sanitwongchai 
said that it was inappropriate for U.S. Ambassador David 
Lambertson to cite the Thai-U.S. Treaty of Amity to press for 
permission for Phaisan Insurance Company to open branches in 
Thailand. The ambassador made his remarks during a meeting with 
Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon. Although the treaty 
stipulates that U.S. companies are entitled to equal treatment 
with their Thai counterparts here, the treaty does not say that 
Thailand must open its insurance market for the United States. 
  Thai Governments, past and present, have tried all ways and 
means, e.g. passage of the copyright law, to have Thailand's 
name erased from the U.S. Priority Foreign Country watch list 
(PFC). But the United States still keeps Thailand on the (PWL) 
[Priority Watch List] list of countries on which it must keep 
close watch. 
  Thailand, however, is ready to give permission to Phaisan 
Insurance Company to open branches in the country in exchange 
for its removal from the U.S. trade watch list. 
  The commerce minister has the authority to give permission 
to 
Phaisan Insurance Company to open branches in Thailand without 
consulting the Judicial Council if he deems his decision 
benefits the country. 
  The Commerce Ministry, however, has forwarded the issue to 
the Judicial Council for fear of making a mistake in 
interpreting the law, not because it wants to delay the issue as 
accused by the U.S. side. 
  Chaloemphon said after the insurance market is opened for 
Phaisan Insurance Company, it is hoped that the United States 
will not make such a request for other U.S. insurance companies 
because the treaty provisions only deal with specific cases. 
The interpretation of the treaty in this case does not set the 
criteria for general practice. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, in his 
capacity as chairman of the International Economic Committee, is 
expected to call a meeting of the committee in February to 
appoint a working team comprised of officials from the agencies 
concerned namely the Finance, Commerce, Industry, and Foreign 
Ministries to review the treaty and decide whether it should be 
amended or abrogated.

  [Text] As Thailand and Laos prepare for closer bilateral 
relations with the opening of the Thai-Lao Bridge scheduled for 
April 8, the two countries remain locked in a diplomatic dispute 
over the purchase of land near Vientiane for a new Thai embassy. 
  Diplomatic sources say the Thai Foreign Ministry in Bangkok 
and embassy in Vientiane have been applying gentle pressure on 
Lao authorities to proceed with the land sale. 
  It was agreed upon by both sides previously but the Laotian 
Government has declined to finalise the deal, citing recent 
legislative change forbidding land sales to foreign diplomatic 
missions. 
  The dispute dates back to the period of former Thai foreign 
minister Asa Sarasin who signed an Exchange of Notes with Lao 
ambassador to Thailand, Bounkeut Sangsomsak, in 1992 for Bangkok 
to purchase for 18 million baht about seven rai on the main 
highway from Vientiane to the border checkpoint at Tha Deua. 
  It is planned to accommodate both a Thai diplomatic mission 
and the embassy. The embassy in downtown Vientiane which now 
houses both the chancery and the ambassador's residence would 
house the latter only. 
  The Thai plans were blocked after Vientiane late last year 
amended laws on land transactions. 
  Deputy Thai Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan raised the 
issue 
with Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat during a visit to 
Vientiane last December. 
  Sources say there was no conclusive outcome as the Lao side 
stood firm on its legal amendments. 
  The deadlock is causing budgetary problems to the Thai side. 
  According to the sources, about 30 million baht was 
allocated 
for the land deal and other related expenditure in the fiscal 
1993 budget, which lapsed last September. The Chuan Likphai 
Government subsequently extended the disbursement deadline of 
this item to March 1994. 
  Since budgetary matters are normally subject to 
parliamentary 
approval, there is concern that it will be difficult to get 
another extension if the March deadline passes without the deal 
being consummated. 
  So the Thais are stepping up their campaign to persuade the 
Laotians to honour the 1992 Exchange of Notes. 
  "As far as we are concerned, this is a fairly 
straightforward 
matter which the Lao side has to honour," a senior Thai diplomat 
told INSIDE INDOCHINA. 
  "The Exchange of Notes is a legally binding commitment. If 
(an international commitment of this nature) is over-ruled by 
subsequent Lao legislative changes, who would be confident 
enough to invest in Laos?" 
  The Thais, pressing for the land deal, are hopeful of a 
positive conclusion before the March deadline.

  [Text] Former chief of Bangkok's World Bank Regional 
Mission said if US President Bill Clinton ends the embargo 
against Vietnam now, it will be tantamount to a "total 
anti-climax in Vietnam and on the international scene." 
  Speaking at a seminar in Bangkok entitled "Doing Real 
Business in Vietnam," Philippe Annez, managing director of 
Griffon Ltd and former chief of Bangkok's World Bank Regional 
Mission, said: "Americans believed they could strangle Vietnam 
by refusing to lift the embargo. Now they realize they can't. 
It (the lifting) is not important anymore. Well, maybe two 
years ago was a better time than now." 
  Jointly held by the Human Resources Institute of Thammasat 
University and Vietnam State Planning Committee (SPC), the 
seminar was to give a preview of Vietnam to 20 businessmen who 
are to visit Vietnam from Feb 23-March 2, 1994. 
  According to Annez, it is too late for Americans even with 
the embargo lifted to establish a strong foothold in Vietnam, 
with which investors from Japan, Europe and other Asian NlCs 
[newly industrialised countries] developed ties years ago. 
  Annez's view was, to a certain degree, orchestrated by Dr 
Luu 
Bich Ho, a senior-ranking Vietnamese official. 
  Dr Ho, chairman of Vietnam's Institute for Long-Term and 
Regional Planning, State Planning Committee told THE NATION he 
welcomed last week's US Senate vote which sent a signal to 
Clinton to Iift the decades-old embargo against Hanoi, against 
Hanoi, and said that there is no reason for the US to maintain 
such an embargo. 
  "It is a good sign...the US Senate voting for lifting the 
embargo," Ho said. Ho was in Bangkok to give a presentation at 
the seminar. 
  According to Ho, Washington had no other motives to maintain 
the embargo against Vietnam because Hanoi had resolved two 
issues: US soldiers missing in action in Vietnam, and the issue 
ot Cambodia. 
  "The US now understands the determination of Vietnam to 
resolve the POW-MIA issue. This has led to the embargo-lifting 
vote," Ho said. "The US also recognized Vietnam's best effort 
to support the peace process in Cambodia," he said. 
  "Last week's Senate vote was a result of a series of 
meetings 
between top leaders of Vietnam and senators from the US," added 
Ho. 
  After over two decades of the embargo, Clinton, since taking 
office in 1993, has eased the embargo two times but refused to 
lift it. 
  US investors have long asked that the embargo be lifted, 
saying that it prevented them, unlike Taiwanese and Japanese 
investors, from enjoying the business opportunities in the 
thriving market economy of Vietnam. 
  Ho, who oversees the strategic planning institute for 
Vietnam's SPC, said that now it is up to the US president to 
officially announce the time to normalize relations. 
  Asked how soon he thought the announcement would come, Ho 
said that Clinton had to resolve the conflicts between different 
US interest groups who are for and against lifting the embargo.

<F P=106> ["United States Must Be Held Totally Responsible for </F>
Catastrophic Consequences Arising From its Perfidy" -- KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the DPRK made public a statement today in 
connection with the fact that the United States is reversing the 
agreement between the DPRK and the United States for a peaceful 
solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. 
  The statement reads in full: 
  The process of a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula has recently run up against a grave 
challenge. 
  The United States has created a momentous crisis that is 
likely to develop into catastrophe, at this crucial juncture 
when prospects are in sight for saving the DPRK-USA talks from 
the current deadlock and striking a package solution to the 
nuclear issue. 
  As is already known, toward the end of the last year the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States 
agreed on the immediate future measures aimed at holding a third 
round of the DPRK-USA talks and reaching a package solution to 
the nuclear issue, under which the United States will cancel its 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises for 1994 and the DPRK 
will accept inspection of limited scope on its nuclear 
facilities required to ensure the continuity of the safeguards 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Accordingly, it is within the framework of the DPRK-USA 
agreement and with our extraordinary patience and maximum 
tolerance that we have so far discussed with the IAEA 
Secretariat the scope of the inspection intended to provide the 
continuity of the safeguards. 
  The IAEA Secretariat, however, has deliberately ignored the 
unique status of the DPRK, which set moratorium on its declared 
withdrawal from the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons, and tried stupidly to force full-scope inspections 
equivalent to the DPRK's de facto return to the treaty, 
inspections on which the DPRK and the United States could reach 
an accord at their future talks, instead of the inspection 
designed for the continuity of the safeguards. The demand for 
full-scope inspection clearly goes against the spirit of the 
DPRK-USA agreement and it is absolutely beyond discussion at all 
at this point of time when the U.S. nuclear threat remains yet 
to be removed, the IAEA's partiality and injustice remain yet to 
be redressed -- factors that have triggered off the DPRK's 
withdrawal from the treaty. 
  This notwithstanding, the United States, a party to the 
DPRK-USA talks, has never tried to help straighten out the IAEA 
Secretariat's misconduct but completely reversed the bilateral 
agreement on the inspection designed exclusively for the 
continuity of the safeguards and officially urged the DPRK to 
accept the demand of the IAEA Secretariat for the full-scope 
inspections. 
  The United States has gone the length of imposing a deadline 
for this and issued an ultimatum that it will not agree to hold 
a third round of the DPRK-USA talks but seek "sanctions", unless 
the DPRK accepts the IAEA's demand. 
  What should be noted seriously is that the United States has 
again broached the "special inspection" of the DPRK's two 
military sites, which have no relevance at all to its nuclear 
activities, and taken the lead in the ruckus for international 
pressure on the DPRK. This is a shameless perfidy against the 
other party to the dialogue. All the facts clearly prove that 
the so far stated U.S. preference for a negotiated resolution of 
the issue and its busy come-and-go are, in the final analysis, 
simply a stratagem aimed at devising a pretense for strangling 
the DPRK and at stalling for time needed to this end. 
  The U.S. machinations of strangling the DPRK have been 
proven self-evidently by the new war manoeuvres the United 
States has been pursuing behind the screen of the DPRK-USA talks. 
  In violation of its repeated commitment to the principle of 
assurances against the threat and use of force, including 
nuclear weapons, the United States plans to defiantly go ahead 
with its large-scale nuclear war exercises against the DPRK, 
including the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. 
  U.S. officials say that they plan to continue other joint 
military exercises if they cannot conduct the "Team Spirit" 
joint military exercises now, and they even say openly that 
these exercises should be held in Hawaii, if not in South Korea. 
  When we proposed the U.S. cancellation of the "Team Spirit" 
joint military exercises as a major agenda for the DPRK-USA 
talks, our objective was to eliminate the U.S. nuclear threat 
against the DPRK once and for all, not just to dename the 
military exercises. 
  The arrogant U.S. posture for "resolving" the nuclear issue 
with its nuclear war exercises going on against the other party 
to the dialogue is a mockery against the DPRK and negation of 
the dialogue itself. 
  What we cannot overlook is the fact that the U.S. hardline 
and conservative forces are pressing ahead on a full scale with 
the deployment of the "Patriot" missiles in South Korea, as part 
of their attempts to overpower the DPRK militarily. Nobody in 
the world will believe that the United States has the intention 
to resolve the issue, as the United States launches smile 
diplomacy at the negotiating table, as if it were interested in 
the withdrawal of its nuclear weapons, while frantically engaged 
in the deployment of its missiles to be trained on the other 
dialogue party from behind the scenes. 
  This notwithstanding, the U.S. State Department spokesman's 
sophistry that the deployment of the U.S. missiles can in no 
way be considered provocative to the DPRK is really the height 
of impudence. 
  The U.S. reckless new war machinations do not stop here. 
  The U.S. Administration sent the director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency to South Korea in the early days of the new 
year for a huddle on the "greater intelligence activities 
vis-a-vis North Korea," a strong indication of the full-scale 
stage of the war preparations. 
  It is not difficult now to guess that the United States will 
move to contrive pretexts for a shift to real military actions. 
  In the light of this, it has become clear to anyone that the 
IAEA Secretariat has intentionally delayed consultations with 
the DPRK, until the films and batteries of the surveillance 
cameras installed at the DPRK's nuclear facilities will have run 
out, and now begun attempting full-scope inspections in an 
intriguing manner, and that these moves have been made in 
pursuit of the calculated stratagem of the United States. 
  All the facts clearly show that the United States has no 
intention at all to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula peacefully but still remains unchanged as ever in its 
ulterior objectives to strangle the DPRK by force at any cost. 
  With regard to the current crisis due to the despicable and 
dangerous actions of perfidy on the part of the United States, 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea solemnly declares its position as follows: 
  First, if the United States defiantly goes ahead and 
reverses 
the promise it has made to the DPRK, the DPRK will no longer be 
bound by the promise it has made to the United States. 
  The DPRK's promise to the United States includes all the 
goodwill measures and commitments it has taken so far 
unilaterally for the continued DPRK-USA talks and for a peaceful 
resolution of the nuclear issue, such as the suspension of the 
effectuation of its announced withdrawal from the treaty on the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the freeze of all the 
nuclear activities, and the declared intention to renounce the 
graphite-moderated reactor system. 
  Second, if the United States has no intention to hold any 
further round of talks, the DPRK, too, will have no intention to 
do so. 
  It will be a gross miscalculation, if the United States 
considers the DPRK-USA talks as an offering to the DPRK. 
  The DPRK has consistently called for negotiations with the 
United States since the first days of the origination of the 
nuclear issue, in order to peacefully resolve the issue, not to 
seek any benefit from the United States. 
  We have so far lived on our own without any relations with 
the United States, we can live well on our own in the future, 
too, and we have become constitutionally adapted to such life. 
  Third, if the United States decides to take other options, 
we 
will also take our own countermeasures. 
  In no way does the right of choice belong to big countries 
only. 
  The U.S. hardliners and conservatives must be held totally 
responsible for the catastrophic consequences arising therefrom, 
and the South Korean authorities, indiscreetly following their 
lead, can never extricate themselves from this responsibility.

  [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry on 1 
February gave the following answer to the question raised by a 
reporter from the Korean Central Broadcasting Committee in 
connection with the recent passage of a bill by the U.S. Senate 
on the initiation of Radio Free Asia. The passage of the bill 
on 25 January by the U.S. Senate on the initiation of Radio Free 
Asia is a criminal act of interfering in the internal affairs of 
and of hostility against our country and other Asian countries. 
  The true intention of the United States in initiating Radio 
Free Asia is to infuse the so-called U.S.-style democratic 
values and the toxin of bourgeois ideology into our country and 
other Asian countries in order to crush [apsal] socialism in 
this region and demolish the independent governments there from 
within. The United States was able to use this machination and 
propaganda effectively to demolish from within the former 
socialist countries in another region in the past and to have 
them return to capitalism, but it is far from workable with our 
country. 
  We have the chuche idea, the great guiding ideology of the 
era of independence, the spirit of independence, and our-style 
way of life; and our people regard the chuche socialism, in 
which the leader, the party, and the masses are wholeheartedly 
united, as their life and lifeline. 
  The United States should immediately stop the game of 
initiating Radio Free Asia, a propaganda and machination 
organization with a hostile aim against our country and other 
Asian countries. 
  If the United States initiates Radio Free Asia despite the 
consistent opposition and rejection of the people of Asian 
countries, it will gain nothing from it. The Asian people, 
including our people, will resolutely confront [tanhohi masso 
nagalkkosida] the U.S.-conducted cold war against Asia by 
steadfastly implementing an independent policy to reject Yankee 
culture and to protect Asian tradition, culture, and 
consciousness.

Project"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
answered a question put by the DPRK Radio and TV Broadcasting 
Committee today with regard to the "Radio Free Asia" bill 
carried at the U.S. Senate recently. 
  He said: 
  The U.S. Senate passed the bill of "Radio Free Asia" on 
January 25. This is an interference in the internal affairs of 
the DPRK and other Asian countries and a criminal act against 
them. 
  What the United States really seeks in setting up the radio 
is to imbue the DPRK and other Asian countries with the "view of 
the value of American-style democracy" and the poison of 
bourgeois ideology, thus stifling socialism in this region and 
destroying the independent governments from within. 
  The United States could profit by such false propaganda in 
disintegrating socialist countries in other regions from within 
and bringing them back to capitalism. But such a propaganda 
cannot work on the DPRK. 
  We have the chuche idea, the great guiding idea of the era 
of 
independence, the independent spirit and our-style way of life. 
The Korean people regard as their life and blood socialism of 
chuche in which the leader, the party and the masses are united 
in one mind. 
  The United States must promptly renounce the plan to set up 
"Radio Free Asia," a tool of vile propaganda against the DPRK 
and other Asian countries. 
  Even if the United States started the broadcast in defiance 
of the unanimous opposition of the Asian people, it would get 
nothing from it. 
  The Asian people including the Korean people will 
determinedly meet the U.S. "cold war" in Asia with the steadfast 
independent policy of rejecting "Yankee culture" and defending 
Asian traditions, culture and consciousness.

  [Text] Our men whose boat had been shipwrecked on the West 
Sea and who had been detained by the South Korean puppets 
returned home. 
  Corporal Kim Chol-chin and Private First Class Kim 
Kyong-chol 
of the Korean People's Security Forces have returned to the 
bosom of the socialist fatherland through Panmunjom today. They 
had their boat shipwrecked on the West Sea off Tungsangot in an 
unexpected accident on 26 January. Drifting toward the South, 
they were abducted by the enemy. 
  The South Korean puppets, instead of (?immediately) 
returning 
our men whom they took away with them, detained them, and 
attempted to have them defect with all sorts of appeasement and 
deception, but failed to bend the revolutionary fidelity and 
will of the soldiers who had been brought up in the bosom of our 
comrade supreme commander to be one-a-match-for-a hundred 
soldiers. 
  Unable to resist the stubborn protest of the detained 
soldiers and our side's repeated demand, they had to return them 
to the northern half of the Republic. 
  According to the final agreement between the secretaries of 
the two sides of the Military Armistice Commission, the soldiers 
of the Korean People's Security Forces who fought among the 
enemies sustaining the revolutionary faith came to the bosom of 
the socialist fatherland crossing the Military Demarcation Line 
proudly in military uniform at 1510 today. They reported in 
high spirits to a Korean People's Army major general who came to 
Panmunjom to greet them on their return to the bosom of comrade 
supreme commander, and cried out, "Long live our supreme 
commander Comrade Kim Chong-il." 
  At Panmunjom, the soldiers of the People's Army and the 
working people of Kaesong warmly greeted them, offering them 
bundles of flowers and hanging flower garlands on them. Then a 
news conference was held at Tongilgak. They exposed that the 
South Korean puppets employed all sorts of maneuvers to have 
them defect. They said that they were able to return to the 
bosom of the socialist fatherland thanks to our comrade supreme 
commander and that they will become loyalists and dutiful 
children protecting and defending comrade supreme commander by 
making themselves guns and bombs.

  [Text] According to report on Cheil [KBS-1 Radio Network] 
Radio in Seoul, troops from the puppet Capital Defense Command 
on 27 January staged war exercises three times during the day 
and night by blindly firing rifles in the area around Mt. Umyong 
in Seoul. Because of war exercise commotions, residents in 
Socho-ku and Kwanak-ku in Seoul, and in Kwachon City, were 
terror-stricken all day. 
  On 21 January, troops from the puppet Capital Defense 
Command 
also staged a war exercise by blindly firing rifles in areas 
around Socho-ku, Seoul, thus arousing a protest from the 
residents. 
  The war exercise commotions staged every day by the South 
Korean puppet clique, which is advertising itself as a civilian 
government, outdistances the war frenzy of successive military 
fascist dictators. Such commotions are part of desperate 
maneuvers designed to divert the attention of the people, who 
are filled with complaints against the incumbent regime. 
  The South Korean people will never tolerate the maneuvers of 
the civilian warmongers who are attempting to evade the crisis 
in their rule by war exercise commotions.

KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the brutal suppression of the followers of the 
chuche idea by the South Korean fascist clique these days. 
Declaring that ideology can never be bound in chain, the 
analyst says: 
  Some time ago, the puppet Kwangju District Court passed 
prison terms on five students of Chonnam National University who 
had studied the chuche idea. 
  Kim Yong-sam, who ruthlessly tramples upon the freedom of 
the 
choice of ideology and quest of truth, while advertising 
"civilian politics," is a political hooligan and tyrant not 
different in the least from the preceding military dictators. 
  His group is trying to keep off the attraction of the great 
chuche idea and incite North-South confrontation, resorting to 
bayonet. But it is a foolish act. 
  The more frantic Kim Yong-sam gets in brandishing the 
bayonet, the stronger the resistance of the people will grow and 
the clearer it will reveal to the world its ignorance and 
incompetency as a ruler without a philosophy worthy of being 
followed by the people. 
  The puppets must guarantee the people the freedom of choice 
of ideology and the quest of truth and release the illegally 
arrested students.

lecture on the subject "paternal love and solicitude shown by 
dear Comrade Kim Chong-il for the Korean young people" and a 
Korean film show which were held in Kazakhstan on January 14 and 
15. 
  Antonov, secretary of the Political Executive Committee of 
the Socialist Party of Kazakhstan, said the secret to the 
invariable defence and advance of the idea of socialism in Korea 
under the complicated international situation lies in the 
singlehearted unity of the entire people under the wise guidance 
of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and dear Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  V.I. Ran, secretary of the Political Executive Committee of 
the Aktyubinsk Regional Committee of the Party, noted that 
support and trust of the Korean people for their leaders is 
immense, indeed. "No one can break the crystal- like 
singlehearted unity of Korea" he said, adding: "In Korea the 
question of carrying forward the revolutionary cause of the 
leader has been successfully solved and education of the young 
people has reached the highest level beyond imagination". 
  Co-chairman of the party A. Alimjanov said: "Only the rich 
monopolize arts and scenic spots in many countries. But in 
Korea all people take part in the creation of arts and enjoy 
holidays at scenic spots. This is the reality which can be 
seen only in Korea where the people revere their leaders as 
fathers."

President Kim Il-song received from party leaders of different 
countries messages supporting his New Year address. 
  General Secretary Renan Raffo Munoz and International 
Secretary Guillermo Herrera Montecinos of the Central Committee 
of the Peruvian Communist Party in their message said that the 
Political Committee of the Central Committee of their party 
adopted a decision fully supporting the New Year address. 
  They said 1993 was a historic year in which the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea won victory in the political and 
military confrontation with the enemy, pushed ahead with 
socialist economic construction, and made strenuous efforts for 
the reunification of the country on the principle of 
independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity, 
thus proving the validity of the revolutionary line of the 
Workers' Party of Korea. 
  Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the Central

Marxism-Leninism), in his message said that his party and all 
the progressive people of Nepal fully support the Korean 
people's just cause of the reunification of divided Korea and 
the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. "We 
hold that the United Nations should adopt an impartial and 
correct policy for peace and security on the Korean peninsula," 
he urged.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 1 KYODO -- The son of North Korean 
President Kim Il-song, now managing the impoverished country's 
domestic affairs, will not take over all his father's powers 
while the elder Kim is living, a source in Beijing said Tuesday 
[1 February]. 
  "There will be no final transfer of power to Kim Chong-il as 
long as Kim Il-song lives," the president's younger brother, Kim 
Yong-chu, reportedly said, according to an East European source. 
The source also said the youngest Kim will remain a "crown 
prince" until his father's death. Such a scenario contradicts 
predictions by foreign watchers who believe that Kim Chong-il, 
also chairman of the National Defense Commission, will soon take 
over his 82-year-old father's duties as president and general 
secretary of the Korean Workers' Party. 
  Kim Yong-chu, however, confirmed that the youngest Kim is 
already handling all domestic affairs while his father remains 
responsible for foreign policy decisions, the source said. 
According to the source, Kim Yong-chu, 72, made the statements 
in a surprisingly open conversation with a Third World diplomat 
in Pyongyang last week, where he denied "any differences" 
between himself and Kim Chong-il. 
  Disputing rumors that he poses a threat to the "model of 
succession," Kim Yong-chu said he "firmly supports the dear 
leader Kim Chong-il" and denounced speculation that China, North 
Korea's strongest ally, would prefer to see him instead of Kim 
Chong-il as future leader of North Korea. Kim Yong-chu, who was 
appointed a member of the Central Committee of the Politburo of 
the party and vice president last December after nearly 17 years 
out of the public eye, has been the center of rumors concerning 
North Korea's future leadership. 
  During the hour-long conversation, Kim Yong-chu did not 
explain his political decline during the 1970s, which, according 
to official versions, was due to a "serious illness," the source 
said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, supreme commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA], 
sent a sixtieth birthday table to merited artiste Chong 
Tu-myong, a composer of the military band of the Supreme Command 
of the KPA. 
  When Seoul was liberated by the People's Army in the period 
of the fatherland liberation war, Chong, a middle school 
student, joined the People's Army in September 1950 and fought 
bravely before being called to the military band of the Supreme 
Command. 
  He became a composer after graduating from a university. 
Over the last 20 odd years he has composed the welcome music (a 
band music) for major political functions, and hundreds of 
pieces of band music, light music and instrumental concert. 
  Upon receiving the sixtieth birthday table and order of the 
National Flag First Class amid the blessings of his 
comrades-in-arms Friday, Chong Tu-myong said: "I feel the urge 
to go to the South with this table and loudly tell my parents, 
brothers and sisters and South Korean people that this is a 
clear token of the noble love and politics of trust of our dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il for the revolutionary soldiers."

<F P=106> [From the "Ray of Chuche" program: "Industrializing </F>
Agriculture Is an Indispensable Task To Ultimately Resolve the 
Rural Question"] 
  [Text] Industrializing agriculture is one of the 
fundamental questions in building socialist rural areas and is 
an indispensable task to ultimately resolving the rural question. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We must 
also vigorously accelerate the technological revolution in rural 
areas and, thus, industrialize agriculture. 
  Industrializing agriculture entails implementing a set of 
modern technological processes and carrying out tasks to build 
irrigation systems, use electric equipment and chemical 
fertilizers in farming, and mechanize farm work. 
  If we industrialize agriculture, we can develop the rural 
economy into a large-scale economy based on modern machinery and 
technology and rapidly increase agricultural production; remove 
differences in agricultural labor and industrial labor; and 
liberate peasants from heavy labor. 
  Industrializing agriculture is an indispensable task to 
ultimately resolve the rural question. First, because this can 
meet material preconditions for resolving the rural question. 
As the "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question" points out, a 
slow increase in agriculture's productive forces is an important 
factor that gives rise to backwardness in rural areas compared 
to urban areas. 
  A socialist society is an advanced society based on superior 
socialist relations in production and a high material and 
technological base. If we are to consolidate the socialist 
system and fully display its superiority, we must continuously 
expand and strengthen socialist relations in production and 
improve the material and technological base to a high level 
required under socialism. 
  A victory of the socialist revolution in urban and rural 
areas makes it possible for socialist relations in production to 
prevail dominantly in rural areas. A high material and 
technological base that can highly display the superiority of 
the socialist system does not automatically result from a 
victory in the socialist revolution. If we are to further 
consolidate the established socialist rural economic system, 
fully display its superiority, and achieve a complete victory of 
socialism, we must continuously develop the technological 
revolution on a higher level and build a strong material and 
technological base of the rural economy, even when the socialist 
system has been established. 
  Industrializing agriculture is a fundamental way to build a 
strong material and technological base of agriculture to comply 
with the innate demands of the socialist rural economic system. 
Industrializing agriculture continuously makes it possible to 
carry out the technological revolution, equip the rural economy 
with modern machinery and technology, widely apply the latest 
achievements of agricultural science to farming, and, thus build 
a strong material and technological base of the rural economy 
and eliminate the slow increase in agriculture's productive 
forces compared to the industrial sector. 
  Today, our country has vigorously carried out the rural 
technological revolution under the party's wise leadership, and, 
as a result, peasants are farming using science and technology 
and working more easily and joyfully. 
  The work to build irrigation systems and use electric 
equipment in farming has already been completed, the work to 
comprehensively mechanize farm work and use chemical fertilizers 
in farming has been implemented on a high level, and the chuche 
farming method has been implemented. As a result, agricultural 
production is being developed rapidly based on modern science 
and technology. 
  Agricultural productive forces have improved to the level 
of those of the industrial sector, and the gap between 
industrial labor and agricultural labor is being narrowed 
significantly. These achievements are a material basis for 
ultimately resolving the rural question. 
  Second, industrializing agriculture is an indispensable task 
because this will quickly fulfill ideological requirements for 
resolving the rural question. The ideological reform of people 
is closely related to the material basis. People's ideology and 
will are affected by the material conditions of society to a 
certain extent. Labor activities are a basic sphere of people's 
lives. Eliminating the fundamental difference between peasants' 
labor activities and those of workers in other fields and 
liberating peasants from heavy labor will make peasants lead 
more independent and creative lives and endlessly demonstrate 
their positive creativity and revolutionary ardor. 
  When peasants are liberated from heavy labor and their lives 
become more independent and creative, they will more positively 
play their role of masters in rural construction and vigorously 
accelerate socialist rural construction. 
  When agriculture is industrialized, all processes in 
agricultural production will completely become technological 
processes, just like in industrial production. This is a 
favorable development that can change peasants' working 
conditions and their lives and more rapidly reform their idea 
and will into the working class' advanced ideology. 
  Consequently, industrializing agriculture plays an important 
role in promoting an environment for resolving the rural 
question. In this way, industrializing agriculture strengthens 
a material and technological basis in rural areas, eliminates a 
gap between increases in agriculture's productive forces and 
increases in the industrial sector's productive forces, and, 
consequently, plays an important role in ultimately resolving 
the rural question. 
  We must vigorously carry out the technological revolution in 
rural areas and, thus, consolidate the previous achievements and 
complete the industrialization of agriculture.

<F P=106> [From the "Ray of Chuche" program: "Properly Conducting </F>
Economic Organizational Work and Inspiring the Masses' 
Enthusiasm Are Important Methods To Carrying Out Economic Tasks"] 
  [Text] All the people across the country are upholding the 
militant tasks presented by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
in his New Year's address and waging a vigorous struggle to 
implement them. The great leader also completely set forth the 
execution methods when he presented the militant tasks of this 
year for the socialist economic construction sector in his New 
Year's address. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: All 
economic guiding functionaries should overfulfill this year's 
people's economic plan by properly conducting the economic 
organizational work and production control in conformity with 
the demand of the party's economic strategy, and by highly 
demonstrating the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm and creative 
positiveness. 
  Properly conducting economic organizational work and highly 
demonstrating the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm and creative 
positiveness with high responsibility are important methods for 
the economic guiding functionaries to overfulfill this year's 
people's economic plan. 
  This year we face formidable tasks of economic construction. 
This year, as has been decided by the 21st plenary session of 
the party's Sixth Central Committee, we should implement the 
agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy, 
push ahead with the coal and electricity industries and railroad 
transportation, which are leading sectors of the people's 
economy, and continue to develop the metal industry. 
  To achieve the enormous task we are facing, economic guiding 
functionaries should first properly conduct economic 
organizational work. To properly conduct economic 
organizational work, one needs to scientifically, rationally, 
and concretely conduct all economic work down to the last 
detail, and this includes drawing up plans, and organizing and 
guaranteeing production. 
  To properly conduct economic organizational work is a demand 
which evolved from the essential character of socialist society. 
A socialist society is a highly organized society where 
everything is organically in gear with each other. For a long 
time, the socialist economy has been tightly linked between 
sectors, production units, and parts of the people's economy 
that move together and develop according to plan. Therefore, 
socialist economy cannot advance a single step if it is not 
organized and economic and technical conditions are not 
sufficiently guaranteed for the production masses to carry out 
economic tasks well. 
  Furthermore, under practical conditions in which the volume 
of socialist economy is growing incomparably and developing 
rapidly, only when all the economic organizational works, 
including economic management and production organization, are 
properly conducted down to the last detail can socialist economy 
be scientifically and rationally managed and operated so as to 
highly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist economic 
system. 
  Properly conducting economic organizational work is also an 
immediate demand to mobilize and use all inner reserves without 
any waste. To discover all inner reserves and make the most of 
them is a firm method to successfully carry out the tasks of 
socialist economic construction that we face this year. 
  Inner reserves exist in diverse form in various sectors of 
the people's economy and they grow as socialist construction 
progresses. However, inner reserves are not easily detected. 
They can only be unsparingly detected and used to the maximum 
in production and construction through the functionaries' keen 
economic organizational works. In other words, the production 
potential and inner reserves can be mobilized and used to the 
maximum only when the economic guiding functionaries conduct the 
management of enterprises and production activities more 
scientifically and rationally, and actively organize the works 
for detailed balance and guarantee linkage between economic 
sectors, production units, parts, and elements. 
  Therefore, the firm guarantee for more successfully carrying 
out this year's economic task of forecasting massive efforts and 
consumption of materials lies in properly conducting the 
economic organizational works. 
  As the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song made clear in his 
New 
Year address, it is one of the important methods in successfully 
carrying out this year's people's economic plan for economic 
guidance for functionaries to highly demonstrate the masses' 
revolutionary enthusiasm and creative positiveness. 
  The production masses are the masters who are directly in 
charge of production. Without the production masses, production 
cannot be done and economic construction cannot progress by any 
means. However, even with the production masses, production does 
not come automatically and socialist economy does not progress 
at a high speed. 
  It is ideological consciousness that regulates all kinds of 
people's acts. The economy can speedily progress when the 
production masses are firmly armed with revolutionary ideology 
and manifest all kinds of creativity and innovation. The work 
to demonstrate the revolutionary enthusiasm and creative 
positiveness of the production masses should become the first 
step of all the works. 
  When all the functionaries firmly adhere to our party's 
ideological theory before executing any work and freshly carry 
out the political works and the works with the people to inspire 
the production masses's ideology in various forms and methods, 
they will achieve economic tasks given to their respective 
sectors and positions displaying revolutionary enthusiasm and 
creative positiveness. 
  When the political work to inspire the masses' ideology is 
vigorously carried out, the spirit of collectivism will be 
highly displayed in the implementation of economic tasks, so 
that collective innovations will be achieved one after another 
and economic management will be carried out based on the 
principles of collectivism. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy presented at the 
21st plenary session of the party's Sixth Central Committee is a 
revolutionary economic construction policy which reflects our 
party's idea to further display the superiority of our socialism 
and strengthen the great might of our socialist self-reliant 
national economy by enhancing the people's living remarkably in 
the near future through a new upsurge in economic construction. 
  All the economic guiding functionaries should properly 
conduct the economic organizational work in conformity with the 
demand of our party's economic strategy and overfulfill this 
year's people's economic plan by always being deeply involved 
with the masses, sleeping and eating together with them so as to 
vigorously carry out political tasks.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January (KCNA) -- Output of export goods 
is increasing in Korea. 
  The Unha combined general bureau on trade, with a goal of 
quadrupling the export volume this year as against last year, is 
improving the quality of processing and introducing diverse 
embroidered patterns catering to the tastes of the customers 
while remodeling the equipment of the factories under it. 
  The Tongdaewon garment factory has taken a long stride in 
equipping itself with complete sets of up-to-date facilities 
capable of producing 100,000 high-class ready-made suits a year. 
  The Korea garment company of the Pyongyang Municipal General 
Bureau of Garment Industry is expanding its export-oriented 
production base and effecting a new turn in garment processing 
trade this year. 
  The Mangyongdae garment factory, the Pyongyang children's 
clothing factory and the Pyongyang Changgwang garment factory 
under the company are topping their daily production quotas for 
coats and jumpers by more than 50 percent. 
  With the application on a new computerized embroidery art, 
the company has doubled the productivity of embroideries and 
exported first-class suits, shirts, padded coats and gloves, 
winning popularity from the importing countries. 
  The Pyongyang alcohol factory, the Odaejin export fisheries 
station and other units have overfulfilled their January plans 
for the production of export goods more than 10 days ahead of 
schedule.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Vasin: "Steps Toward the Throne. Kim </F>
Il-song: Who Is He?" Names in parentheses as transliterated] 
  [Text] The "Great Leader" of the Korean people was created 
and cultivated and exists not in accordance with the wishes of 
the people of North Korea, but in accordance with a design of 
the CPSU Central Committee Politburo planned in advance and of 
the leader of all the peoples personally. 
  A whole system of authorities formed north of the 38th 
parallel was involved in his formation, elevation, and 
confirmation in the role of military commander, theorist, and 
leader. Here is a rough sketch of these authorities: Colonel 
General Shtykov, the direct representative of the Central 
Committee Politburo responsible for the entire situation on the 
ground and former secretary of the CPSU Leningrad Oblast 
Committee; the 25th Army's Military Council, Major General 
Lebedev; the 25th Army's Special Propaganda Section, Major 
Kovyzhenko, chief, who subsequently came to be called senior 
official of the CPSU Central Committee; the newspaper CHOSON 
SINMUM; and Pyongyang Radio, whose programs were produced by 
representatives of our country. The University of Pyongyang, 
which was formed in accordance with a decision of the CPSU 
Central Committee, and its provost, Pak Il, a Soviet scholar. It 
was he who taught Kim Il-song the rudiments of Marxist-Leninist 
science. The Soviet military administration--Major General 
Romanov and Colonel Ignatov, his deputy for political affairs. 
And, of course, the KGB (Army counterintelligence), headed by 
Major General Anokhin. 
  Your author was working in the Army's Special Propaganda 
Section as assistant section chief. According to the listed 
establishment, this section was in wartime to work among the 
troops and the populace of the enemy. 
  The branch had 14-15 officers of Korean extraction. We 
created Kim Il-song from scratch, virtually, and performed this 
work "crudely and visibly," without embarrassment or pangs of 
conscience--as the party ordered. I more than others, possibly, 
dealt with Kim Il-song on a daily and weekly basis in the first 
five or six months. Then, as Terentiy Fomich Shtykov's staff 
grew, the section's role was scaled back. Nonetheless, the work 
that enabled Kim to become not only a military commander but 
also a leader was performed in the first two years. 
<H5>  The Situation From 18 Through 23 August 1945 </H5>
  The decree of the Japanese emperor on capitulation was 
announced in the morning of 15 August. Units of our 25th Army 
were pushing forward through Manchuria in the direction of the 
Korean borders. In the night of 16 August they entered Yanji, 
where the headquarters of the Japanese 5th Army were located. On 
17 August the commander of our 25th Army, Colonel General 
Chistyakov, the celebrated hero of the battle of Stalingrad, 
accepted the surrender of the Japanese from Major General 
Hachiro Iketani, chief of staff of the Army. The Japanese 
general reported that Japan had observed all the terms of the 
surrender and that only one subunit was, in view of its 
isolation from headquarters, putting up resistance to our 
advance, for which General Iketani apologized. 
  The higher command ordered General Chistyakov personally to 
deplane at Pyongyang. Immediately! He ordered that the trains be 
loaded up and that they make full-speed for Pyongyang. Others 
followed at their own pace. 
  I know that there were no national formations in our Army's 
units. And had there been, we would have been well aware of it. 
Our section was required to look after such subunits and rely on 
them in its work. There was no detachment of Kim Il-song or the 
Chinese Wang Song on the Korean salient. This "presence" of 
national subunits was designed subsequently as camouflage for 
the future leader. 
  Chistyakov's aircraft touched down at Pyongyang Airport. 
Accompanying the general was a group of submachinegunners, a 
radio operator, and a signals officer. Koreans and Japanese were 
awaiting the appearance of the Soviet forces. Several cars were 
made available to Ivan Mikhaylovich, who set off directly for 
the residence of Shoji Furukawa, governor of the northern 
provinces. But this building had at four in the afternoon been 
taken over by a people's committee, which had arisen 
spontaneously. But the official acceptance of the surrender took 
place here, in the former office of the Japanese general. 
  Colonel General Chistyakov as yet knew nothing of Kim 
Il-song. He and many others had simply not been notified, and he 
acted as prudence dictated. Moscow had not yet chosen the person 
whom it would back. 
  Cho Man-sik? A leader of the national liberation movement of 
1919. He had together with Syngman Rhee led the 1 March 
uprising. The difference between them was that Cho Man-sik had 
spent from 1919 through 1945 in jail. Syngman Rhee, on the other 
hand, had been in exile. Cho Man-sik was released from prison in 
accordance with the emperor's capitulation decree, and Syngman 
Rhee arrived in South Korea on 17 August from Hong Kong. 
  Representatives of the people's committees had since 21 
August been coming to our command headquarters, and from there 
they were sent to us, to our Special Propaganda Section. People 
came in a stream to express gratitude for the liberation, to 
register, to present a complaint, to communicate something or 
other of importance, and so forth. 
  Such people in our section were former members of the 
All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) who had been infiltrated 
into Korea in the 1930's by a decision of the Communist 
International Executive Committee and the Profintern. On 15 
August they also had been released from prison. About 10-12 
persons were the most active. They included (Pak Den Ay) (Vera 
Tsoy. She would subsequently become vice chairman of [Yezheni 
Kotton's] International Organization of Women), her husband, 
(Kim Yem Bom), and others. It was they and their comrades who 
notified all provinces that the First Communist Party of Korea 
Congress would be held in Pyongyang on 28 August. They 
themselves on the very first day went to the former governor's 
residence and together with Cho Man-sik joined the Provisional 
People's Committee of North Korea. Cho Man-sik perfectly 
naturally occupied the post of chairman, and he was at this time 
supported by the Communists. 
  Some special propaganda officers made, as we were told 
later, 
a mistake. They visited without permission the People's 
Committee building and congratulated Cho Man-sik on the 
liberation. This was on 21 August 1945. The mistake was caused 
by the fact that we did not know Moscow's intentions. Not just 
we, but Lebedev, member of the Military Council, did not these 
first two days know on whom to rely and whom to recognize and 
whom not to recognize. 
<H5>  Kim Il-Song Comes to Us </H5>
  Kim Il-song showed up at our section on 22 August 1945 in 
the 
latter part of the day. He said, if I am not mistaken, that 
General Lebedev had recommended that he report here. 
  Kim arrived without any soldiers or an adjutant. Our khaki 
field uniform, service cap of the rifle troops, box-calf boots, 
and the Order of the Red Banner. The young Korean officers of 
the section clustered round him. Questions, cross-questioning. 
  Kim Il-song really was part of a guerrilla detachment 
operating in the areas of Manchuria bordering Korea. Prior to 
this he had lived in a rural locality on the territory of China. 
There, according to him, he completed seven grades of a Chinese 
rural school. The officers of the section observed that he did 
not, evidently, have a great command of Korean, although they 
themselves were far from perfection. 
  As Kim himself told me, he and a group of Korean and Chinese 
citizens had, under pressure from Japan's punitive detachments 
endeavoring to clean up the rear areas in connection with the 
country's entry into the war against the United States, crossed 
our border. An international brigade, which numbered 
approximately 300 Chinese and Koreans, was formed from such 
defectors in 1942. They were quartered in the village of 
Vyatskoye near Khabarovsk. Kim Il-song was appointed commander 
of this brigade, and Wang Song, whom I had met twice, commissar. 
The rank of captain was established for Kim Il-song, and for 
Wang Song, major. According to the establishment, the brigade 
was called 1st Battalion, 88th Brigade. 
  This Korean-Chinese international subunit organized drills 
itself, under the supervision of counterintelligence officers. 
Political classes and political information sessions were held, 
and combat training was performed. Much time was allotted for 
domestic chores. 
  There had been no orientation toward Kim prior to the start 
of the war with Japan. No one knew who would be the head of a 
liberated Korea. Everyone was kitted out for the march. Wang 
Song and Kim Il-song were presented with the Order of the Red 
Banner. Only subsequently would these decorations be formalized 
by an order of General Purkayev, commander of the front (almost 
a week after Kim, wearing the decoration on his chest, arrived 
in Korea). 
  After General Chistyakov's departure, the headquarters staff 
loaded up the cars. Our section traveled in the first train. Kim 
Il-song and a group of Koreans, in the second train, this group 
having been pushed forward by the officer who had been assigned 
to it. The Soviet Army uniform, the decoration, and the 
assistance of the SMERSH officer enabled Kim to enter Pyongyang 
on 22 August. 
  The myth that he had for 14 years been in command of a large 
formation, kept virtually all Japanese forces in Manchuria on a 
state of alert, smashed enemies on land, stormed ports, and 
commanded an armored formation on an offensive was needed to 
elevate Kim to the level of hero in order to use him for work in 
Korea. The Soviet propaganda authorities not only did not 
prevent these rumors, they encouraged them and augmented them in 
the press and on the radio. 
  On 23 August 1945 Section Chief V.V. Kovyzhenko received the 
order--disguise Kim, get the Order of the Red Banner as far away 
as possible. 
  Work was in full swing. We were rendered inestimable 
assistance by (Pak Den Ay) and her husband (Kim Yem Bom). They 
procured two suits: one was clearly too small, the other fit. I 
said: "Well, try sitting down!" Kim sat down, and his pants 
split below the fly. (Pak Den Ay) cheered us up: "Never mind! 
I'll solve the problem in a flash," and she sewed up the fly. A 
normal, everyday occurrence. 
  In the yard I took a photograph of Kim Il-song in this suit, 
sporting a striped necktie. This was the first photograph of Kim 
in Korea. It was in this suit that he attended the Communist 
Party congress. 
<H5>  First Communist Party of Korea Congress </H5>
  Kim's first step en route to the throne was the Communist 
Party of Korea congress held on 28 August 1945 in Pyongyang. For 
some reason or other, our historians have little to say about 
this congress; the Koreans, on the other hand, are simply silent. 
  We had not shown up in Pyongyang as yet, but the date of the 
congress had been fixed. Moscow knew nothing about the congress 
that was being convened. Those who initiated the convening of 
the first congress were the Communists who in the 1930's had 
been sent into Korea along Communist International Executive 
Committee, Profintern, and Communist Youth International lines. 
(Kim Yem Bom), Vera Tsoy, and their comrades may be put in this 
category. They joined this work as soon as they were released 
from prison, and their actions were perfectly justified; they 
were of the sole conviction that Korea should be together with 
the Soviet Union. 
  The Korean Communist Party had been distinguished by 
factionalism and was dissolved in 1919 by a decision of the 
Comintern Executive Committee. Now Moscow remained silent: 
Banning it was impossible; the mechanism of the convening of the 
congress had been engaged. 
  General Lebedev, member of the Military Council, demanded 
that we get Kim Il-song ready for the congress and present the 
Russian text of his speech on 25 August. Three days remained. We 
set about writing the speech. The text was ready in half a day. 
The approximate contents of Kim Il-song's speech which I handed 
over to the Korean Workers Party History Institute 40 years 
later are as follows: "The role of the Soviet Army in the 
liberation of Korea, urgent tasks of the Communists for creating 
and strengthening the organs of power, the land issue, and 
Lenin's theory of the building of socialism and its application 
under the conditions of the Korean revolution." 
  General Lebedev approved the contents. "Get Kim ready," he 
said. We began to translate the speech into Korean, then gave 
the speech to Kim for him to study it (it was approximately five 
typewritten pages). We were well aware that he had while in the 
international brigade studied Marxism-Leninism for three years 
and that this speech would not be very difficult for him. 
  The congress opened in a red-brick home. It was arranged 
that 
(Kim Yem Bom) would nominate Kim Il-song for the Presidium and 
give a brief description of his services to the people. 
  And here was Kim in the Presidium. He spoke on day two. A 
section officer from the ranks of our Koreans who had checked 
his speech against a second copy notified me: "All is in order. 
He interposed only a few words." I asked Kim in the future to 
insert fewer of his own words. 
  We received the instruction: No decisions to be adopted at 
the congress, no working bodies to be elected, elect an 
organizing bureau, and work on the program and rules. Kim 
submitted precisely these proposals. They were adopted. Moscow's 
hand was being felt already. Moscow's decision to form an 
alternative party was adopted subsequently and transmitted here, 
to Korea. The formation of this party was entrusted to Kim's 
best friend--(Tsoy Yen Gen). 
  Subsequently a joint congress of the two parties was 
convened. The Communist Party and the People's Party united. The 
Workers Party of Korea was formed. Kim Il-song was elected 
general secretary of the party. 
  Moscow evidently believed that by manipulating the names of 
the parties it could fog the brains of its ideological 
adversaries. Such party conversion became the fashion. 
<H5>  The Next Step </H5>
  Following a recommendation of Vera Tsoy, in this third week 
of August we selected for ourselves apartments in homes that had 
previously belonged to Japanese. 
  Kim Il-song took up quarters opposite (Kim Yem Bom). My 
apartment--next door to Kim's--was separated from his house 
merely by a low fence and a slope. Further on, behind me, was 
(Tsoy Yen Gen)--the future minister of defense--and next to him, 
(Mu Den)--commander of the new military formations of Koreans. 
So we rubbed shoulders with the future leader daily. 
  Mun (I forget his last name), who had been released from 
prison and who had a good knowledge of Russian, became infected 
with the idea of the immediate formation of a youth union of 
Korea, although he was already around 35-40. We reported this to 
higher levels. Colonel General Shtykov, who had assumed the 
office of ruler of Korea on the part of the CPSU Central 
Committee Politburo, gave the go-ahead, and the work began. 
  I was entrusted with preparing the Democratic Youth Union 
Rules. I did not spend long thinking about it and took as the 
basis the VLKSM [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] 
Rules. Mun and I got together in my apartment, extracted from 
the VLKSM Rules what, in our opinion, was unnecessary, and added 
what could impart to the new union a national coloration. It was 
reported to Shtykov. He approved. We prepared a very brief 
speech for Kim Il-song. It was decided: Let the delegates say 
all that they want. 
  The congress opened at the end of October (at the start of 
November, possibly). Mun delivered a prepared report. Then, to 
applause, Kim Il-song spoke. A bureau and bureau 
secretary--Mun--were elected. The young people accepted Kim as 
planned. 
  The press and radio gave the congress and Kim Il-song's role 
in the formation of the Youth Union extensive coverage. Kim 
Il-song ascended one further rung of his Olympus. 
<H5>  KGB General Anokhin Made the Decision </H5>
  A prominent place in the history of the national liberation 
movement of Korea belongs not to Kim Il-song but to Cho Man-sik, 
whom Lieutenant General Furukawa, fulfilling the decree of 
Emperor Hirohito, had been forced to release from confinement. 
  General Chistyakov accepted the surrender in premises in 
which the occupant for four days had been Cho Man-sik. The faith 
in him and the respect for him were noticeable. By the end of 
August the Pyongyang People's Committee had become the central 
committee and had brought all the provincial committees under 
its jurisdiction. The question arose: Whom to support? Moscow 
finally rested its choice on Kim Il-song, and to firmly 
establish Kim Il-song the machinery of the KGB was set in motion. 
  General Lebedev proposed that I present myself to Major 
General Anokhin, chief of counterintelligence of the 25th Army: 
"He has something going on there. He is requesting assistance in 
work with the captive Lieutenant General Furukawa." I reported 
to General Anokhin; he was interrogating Furukawa. Anokhin was 
seeking an answer to the question of how Cho Man-sik was 
released. The Japanese general had allegedly told Cho Man-sik: 
"People's committees are already being organized there. Go and 
take the position of committee chairman." 
  I expressed doubt. Furukawa had simply let fall the words: 
"People's committees are being formed there." "I will write 
down," Anokhin told me, "that Furukawa installed Cho Man-sik as 
chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee." I did not at that 
time believe that the KGB could operate so crudely. This is 
precisely what happened. After this entry, Moscow sent for 
Furukawa, and Cho Man-sik was declared an agent of Japanese 
imperialism. Thus began the displacement of the hero of the 
national liberation movement. 
  It subsequently became known that Cho Man-sik had in recent 
days been conversing by telephone with Southern Korea, Seoul, 
Syngman Rhee, his associate in the struggle. All this was in the 
press and on radio. The hero of Korea had become its enemy, and 
Kim Il-song, whom we had installed, a hero. 
  In the latter half of October (?) Cho Man-sik was placed 
under house arrest, and I do not know what happened to him 
subsequently, but it is firmly believed that he was removed as 
an obstacle to the development of our candidates. 
  All means were employed to discredit a person who had lost 
his health and who had renounced all earthly blessings for the 
sake of the freedom of Korea. It was impossible for anyone to 
raise a voice of protest. The KGB operated crudely, but 
productively. 
  Kim Il-song stepped over the rung over which the corpse of 
Cho Man-sik was draped and ascended to a third, higher rung. 
Moscow's will was done. 
<H5>  The Main Test for the Office of `Great Leader' </H5>
  The decision was made at the top: Prepare and stage a mass 
meeting, at which Kim Il-song is presented to the entire Korean 
people. This meeting was scheduled for 14 October 1945. Its 
venue--the stadium at the foot of Mount Moranpong. All the 
provinces were invited. 
  It was necessary by the time of this meeting: 
  --to have shown that Kim Il-song was a real person, that 
Paektu Mountain tiger about which the press was speaking; 
  --to have widely publicized the venality of Cho Man-sik; 
  --to have staged a meeting between Kim and his relatives (to 
have found them, wherever they were, and to have brought them to 
the village of [Mangende], which is 13-14 km from Pyongyang); 
  --to have exposed the "false" information of the South 
Korean 
press and radio to the effect that Kim Il-song was not Kim 
Il-song but someone else--a figurehead; 
  --to have proven that Kim had been engaged in active 
fighting 
against the Japanese aggressors and had liberated the 
motherland. To have shown at the same time that Syngman Rhee was 
a puppet of the United States and lackey of the American 
imperialists. 
  There was a great deal of work--the entire machinery had no 
time off. There were sleepless nights also, but we coped and 
sharpened the teeth of the Paektu Mountain tiger. 
  In the embassy lobby, (Kwon Ki-chen), ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the DPRK in the USSR, 
showed me a huge portrait of Kim painted on the wall. Alongside 
was a blue lake, and behind the lake there was a village with 
little houses in the style of a Buddhist retrospective. I said 
that I had not seen anything like that at that time. "This is 
Mangyongdae!" he said. I visited this Mangyongdae twice. Some 
relatives were brought to the village, correspondents were 
summoned, and the squalid peasant houses were photographed. This 
went on until 14 October 1945. We asked our superiors: "What 
should we do? They are putting Kim's portraits in the columns in 
front of Stalin's." "Let them put them in front of Marx's, 
even," was the response. 
  I would like to explain in advance that my comrades and I, 
everyone who worked with Kim Il-song at that time, did their 
duty knowingly and with a will on preparing him for work--it was 
impossible to do otherwise. In addition, our attitude toward 
him, as a person for whom it was difficult getting into the 
part, was good! 
  As of 1 October, it was announced on the radio several times 
a day that a meeting would be held at Moranpong Stadium. The 
words: "It is possible that Kim Il-song will be present at the 
meeting!" "It is possible that Kim Il-song, the leader of our 
people, will be present at the meeting!" "It is possible that 
our legendary hero will be present at the meeting!" and so 
forth, were inserted in every announcement here. 
  The speech, on which not only we but also the superior 
authorities worked, was of a program nature. It was not one of 
those hastily concocted speeches that our section used to 
prepare, but a considered, serious speech, which had even been 
perused in Moscow, possibly. The meeting was more than 
successful. We had taken a larger step toward Kim Il-song's 
ultimate assumption of the office of chairman of the People's 
Committee. Cho Man-sik had gone. In two months we had made Kim 
the leader, and subsequently, several years later, he would 
become "Great." 
<H5>  The Grenade's Flight Trajectory </H5>
  One further large-scale political demonstration was planned: 
holding a mass meeting devoted to the friendship of the Korean 
and Soviet peoples. It was decided to time it to coincide with 
National Liberation Day. 
  In the columns, on the viewing stand, and on the buildings 
adjoining the railroad station were appeals for the eternal 
friendship of the two peoples. A letter from the Korean people 
to the Soviet people was read out from the stand. It contained, 
as we had thought when we were preparing this letter, the 
felicitous thought suggested by Senior Lieutenant Cho Ki-chong, 
who worked on the newspaper CHOSON SINMUM: "As long as the 
shining waters of the Tumen River flow and as long as the 
magnificent Paektu Mountain stands, the friendship of the Korean 
and Soviet peoples will grow and strengthen." 
  I wrote in my recollections for the Workers Party of Korea 
History Institute: "I was getting ready to take my amateur 
closeup. I heard a hissing and saw smoke. A grenade, which by 
chance did not make it into this shot, in which representatives 
of the province of Sinuiju were seated on the steps of the 
viewing stand, was flying toward the stand. Junior Lieutenant 
Ya.T. Novichenko, who had with his platoon been assigned to the 
detail maintaining order and looking out for the security of the 
persons on the viewing stand, was standing next to me. In a 
split second he had climbed over the two steps and grabbed the 
grenade, but was not in time to hurl it away from the stand. The 
grenade exploded. He survived. I raised up him slightly. Two 
soldiers of the Korean People's Army and his platoon sergeant 
took hold of the wounded man and dispatched him to the hospital. 
  The viewing stand was no less than 30 meters long. Section 
Chief V.V. Kovyzhenko was standing on the platform three meters 
from the explosion. The authorities, including Kim Il-song, were 
30 meters away, in front of the left microphone. This explosion 
of the home-made grenade could be heard by a negligible part of 
the participants in the meeting standing in front of the 
platform. The powerful voice of (Kim Yem-bom) conveyed this 
incident to the inhabitants of the whole city. The entire blame 
was heaped on Syngman Rhee and the American imperialists. The 
explosion of the grenade added, as it were, to our arguments in 
the anti-American propaganda. 
  Illustrating this action earlier had been impossible. 
Everything was classified. The propaganda wave was raised later. 
Particularly when Kim Il-song made his first tour of the 
countries of the socialist camp from 16 May through 1 July 1984. 
  Novichenko's exploit became an exploit in the name of Kim 
Il-song and the salvation of Kim Il-song. 
  It was written that Novichenko, standing on the platform, 
had 
jumped up and grabbed the grenade, which was allegedly flying 
toward the place where Kim Il-song was standing. I looked into 
this version with Yakov Tikhonovich himself: We established that 
there had been no such trajectory--the grenade was flying toward 
the area in front of the stand, to its right. It was then that 
doubts and questions arose with us: 
  Why had we stuck to the version to the effect that the 
grenade was flying straight toward Kim Il-song and that the 
junior lieutenant had leaped up (Colonel General Chistyakov, 
commander of the Army, was not present on the viewing stand but 
describes the scene such as to indicate that he saw the way the 
grenade was flying and how Novichenko had leaped up)? 
  Why was the home-made grenade thrown by the agents of 
American imperialism so feeble? If it had not been picked up, 
the officer could have gotten away with a lighter wound. A woman 
standing alongside sustained a slight leg wound, and elderly 
people sitting next to her, back injuries, but those who were 
two or three strides away on the viewing stand (Major Kovyzhenko 
included) were not injured. There was no intention to shoot to 
kill, evidently. 
  Were the opponents of the new system unable to find if only 
one real grenade for Kim Il-song? 
  There is no clear proof that the explosion was staged. Nor 
was this in any way apropos at that time. The trajectory was 
changed. Was this really important? What was important was that 
the trajectory of the entire course of social development of the 
DPRK was warped, just like that of the grenade. 
  I would observe that at meetings held prior to this the 
leadership had always been at the center of the platform. On 
this occasion it was for some reason or other on the left side 
of the lengthy stand. And the grenade was thrown at the right 
side of the stand, where the guests or minor officials were 
positioned. So the action did not pursue the aim of 
assassination of the "leader of the Korean people," the aim was 
to create a big political outburst among the people and rouse 
them to hatred of the American and Syngman Rhee regimes. And, of 
course, to exalt Kim Il-song. The KGB's action produced 
"positive" results. 
  The explosion of hatred for the Syngman Rhee regime in Korea 
was for our country undoubtedly more valuable than the right 
hand of a junior lieutenant. 
<H3>  How the `Great' Kim Il-song and K.U. Chernenko, General 
Secretary of the CPSU, Made a Film About the Great Friendship </H3>
  From May through July 1984 Kim Il-song paid visits to all 
countries of the socialist camp. A meeting with Yakov Novichenko 
had been prepared for him on the platform of Novosibirsk 
Station. "He warmly embraced the Siberian" and..."called him a 
symbol of Korean-Soviet friendship." Prior to this, a decree on 
the conferment on him of the title of Hero of Labor of the DPRK 
had been registered. 
  At the talks with Chernenko, Kim Il-song proposed the 
shooting of a two-part feature film, the basis of which was to 
be Novichenko's exploit. The proposal was joyfully accepted, 
and...the wheels were set in motion. Features on Yakov 
Tikhonovich's exploit had appeared in SELSKAYA ZHIZN, SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA, and KRASNAYA ZVEZDA by this time. The shooting of the 
film was entrusted at the Mosfilm [Moscow Feature Film Studio] 
to the famous director Eldor Urazbayev. 
  Since it was impossible for the film not to contain 
operations of our troops in the liberation of Korea, I expressed 
my doubts in a letter to Shauro, head of the CPSU Central 
Committee Culture Department, dated 23 January 1985 as to the 
possibility of a correct illustration of our Army's operations 
and declared plainly that Korea would in the film, evidently, be 
liberated by Kim Il-song himself. I received a reply, the 
meaning of which was that it was not my business and that I 
should keep my nose out of these matters. But since my brief 
essays had been carried in two newspapers, Mosfilm decided to 
invite me for a consultation. At an enlarged session of the 
Mosfilm Party Committee, I and Novichenko were asked many 
questions about Kim Il-song and the action of Yakov Tikhonovich. 
In the end I declared: "The film will not be a success. Our 
Korean comrades will make it such as to suit Kim Il-song." 
  In a private conversation with Director Urazbayev, I had 
asked that the filming of the mass meeting show hanging on the 
viewing stand a poster about Korean-Soviet friendship, although 
I knew in advance that it would not contain even this trifle 
either. Kim Il-song's national socialism expressed in his Chuche 
philosophy was too strong. 
  The film was made. Kim Il-song routs the Japanese forces on 
land and at sea. The Soviet Army appears indistinctly somewhere 
here and there. He fights his way to Pyongyang. Victory! The 
shots of the operations of our troops and others taken by 
Urazbayev were not found suitable. 
<H5>  Who Are These `Bad People' and How Many Are There of Them </H5>
  At a dinner given by (Kwon Ki-chen), ambassador 
extraordinary 
and plenipotentiary of the DPRK in the USSR, the guests and the 
host were seated at a round table. Behind each guest was a young 
Korean woman in national dress. Accompanying us was an agent of 
the KGB. This had long been the custom, evidently--any visit to 
any embassy would be accompanied by the attachment to the guests 
of a KGB agent. In this case he was called a representative of 
Mosfilm. 
  In the course of the dinner, the ambassador invited us into 
the film hall to view a film on the great leader's visit to the 
socialist countries. In color and with skillfully chosen camera 
angles, it made a dispiriting impression on me. Kim Il-song in 
splendor, one foot forward, his face radiant, his mouth, as 
always, half-open, his service jacket of the Stalin-Mao Zedong 
cut. Chernenko looked frail and bowed. He looked the same next 
to Honecker, Zhivkov, Ceausescu, and others. 
  At table, after the showing, I was asked: "Whom else did you 
know?" I replied: (Kim Yem-bom, Pak Den-ay). "They are bad 
people!" (Kwon Ki-chen) said. I recall Kim Tu-pong, who became 
chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly Presidium. "What do 
you mean, what do you mean? He is a bad person!" the ambassador 
said. All right, I thought, I'll talk about (Tsoy Yen-chen), 
Kim's best friend. They ate cabbage soup together for three 
years at Khabarovsk, and, in addition, in the Korean adventure 
of 1950-1953 he held the position of secretary for defense.... 
He proved to be a "bad person" also. 
  "And what did you like in the field of art and culture?" I 
recalled a wonderful ballerina, about whom our press was writing 
at that time--(Tsoy Sin-ki). I attended her concerts. Star of 
the East was what she was called even in Southern Korea. I had 
not finished speaking about her before the embassy secretary 
interrupted: "No, no! She is an enemy!" 
  No one knows how many "bad people" there were in the DPRK. 
Perhaps there were even more relative to its population of 11 
million than with us. 
<H5>  Parameters of Honor and Conscience </H5>
  In 1946 at mass meetings in Pyongyang in honor of May Day 
and 
the anniversary of the Great October, balconies, fences, and 
walls of houses were covered with posters devoted to the 20 
years of generalship of Kim Il-song. We subtract from 1946 the 
year in which Kim Il-song was born. We are left with 34. We take 
20 from 34 and are left with 14. This is the age at which the 
military commander was born. In our times he is a 
generalissimo.... Mankind has yet to devise a higher rank for 
Kim Il-song. But what is most interesting is that at the age of 
14 he had not even completed the seventh grade of the Chinese 
rural school and could not read and write properly. 
  I have in front of me a work of his son, Kim Chong-il, 
written on 17 October 1982, a work of that same Kim Chong-il, 
who, still in short pants and seated on his father's lap, took 
aim at me with a pistol in 1946. The work is called "The Workers 
Party of Korea--the Chuche Revolutionary Party--Inheritor of the 
Glorious Traditions of the Anti-Imperialist Alliance." This 
"study" was devoted to the "56th anniversary of the founding by 
Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader, of the Anti-Imperialist 
Alliance--AIA." 
  We subtract 56 from 1982. We are left with 26. We subtract 
the year in which Kim Il-song was born, we are left with that 
same 14. He was at this 14, apparently, not only a military 
commander but also a great politician. Where did Kim get all 
this from? It all came from us. We taught him to lie. In 1945 he 
was unable to put together decent notes for a speech at the 
political classes, despite the program's demands for the study 
of Russian, and had not in three years mastered the basics of 
Marxism-Leninism, and 19 years before this he was the 
outstanding founder of the AIA. 
  "In 1926, having formed the AIA, he took" (as his son's work 
says) "the helm of the revolution and transformed Northern Korea 
into a country of model socialism." 
  In the meager pamphlet Kim Chong-il calls his father the 
"Great Leader" 60 times. In an illustrated magazine in 
Russian--KOREYA--the authors of various articles call the 
leader's son, Kim Chong-il, "beloved leader" 40 times. 
  They outdid us. We had this also, but somewhat less. They 
are 
from that same CPSU Central Committee Politburo mold loaded with 
the ready-made cadres necessary for the victory of communism 
throughout the world. 
  Speaking about the role of the philosophy of Chuche, Kim 
Chong-il, the son of the great one, writes: "It is essential 
that we continue to move steadfastly forward along the 
revolutionary path, which starts from Paektu Mountain, and 
brilliantly complete the Chuche revolutionary cause, the cause 
of socialism and communism." 
  In addition, Chuche philosophy, in the opinion of the son, 
"should be the theoretical basis for the victory of communism 
worldwide and should raise the value of man to the highest 
level" (Kim Chong-il. "Conversation with party officials dealing 
with questions of theory, 2 April 1974"). 
  What, in fact, is the point of reproaching Kim Il-song and 
gauging the parameters of his honor and conscience? He is, after 
all, copied from us. He is as we used to be. We had the same 
military commanders and theorists. We extolled him and praised 
him in such a way that he did in actual fact decide that he was 
great. It is hard now to persuade him that he with his 
mumbo-jumbo--Chuche philosophy--is an ignoramus. 
  General Shtykov ordered me by telephone to take in at my 
quarters Kim's friend--Wang Song, commissar of the international 
brigade--and not let him out. But Wang kept asking and asking to 
see Kim. I reported to the general that Wang was dying to see 
Kim. "All right," the general said, "take him, but have him back 
by nightfall." 
  ....We drank vodka, then wine, by the glass. We switched to 
tumblers. Kim's wife and soldiers served appetizers. At my 
request we all switched to Russian. Wang, a head shorter than 
Kim, animated, agile, spare, drank and did not become 
intoxicated. But Kim turned sour.... "They will get to know 
about us yet.... We will be appreciated yet!" he said. He was 
not mistaken. We got to know, we cultivated, and we appreciated. 
So who is he? Not, of course, a military commander, not a 
theorist, and not a philosopher, and a leader in the broad 
meaning of this word even less. A simple and obedient 
border-crosser who came within the sights of our intelligence 
authorities. More precisely, he was more obliging, far from 
having any ideas of his own, and capable of repeating what was 
suggested to him. 
  In the European socialist countries, the leaders were 
selected the same way. If they went wrong, they were replaced, 
and new ones were picked and installed. But here, forever, and 
with Asian singularities and brutality. 
  In Korea we were frequently asked about other Kims, and 
names 
were cited. But this was no longer any use to anyone. The choice 
had been made. The raw "product" was polished up and brought to 
a shine. And, as you can see, we produced quite a shine! 
  Well, all right, I thought at that time, we have glorified 
him in order to have our man in foreign parts. But we now we 
must stop. Let his own nation, his own people, appreciate him.

  [Text] A high-level parliamentary delegation from the 
Kingdom of Thailand led by Professor Marut Bunnak, president of 
the House of Representatives and of the Parliament of the 
Kingdom of Thailand, arrived in Vientiane this morning on an 
official friendship visit to Laos. The visit is being made at 
the invitation of Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR] National Assembly. The delegation 
consists of 10 members of parliament from six different 
political parties, representatives of the Thai mass media, and 
other personnel. 
  An official ceremony to welcome the high-level Thai 
parliamentary delegation was held at the National Assembly Hall. 
On hand to welcome Prof. Marut Bunnak, his wife, and the 
visiting Thai delegation were National Assembly Chairman Saman 
Vi-gnaket and his wife; Chaleun Yiapaoheu, member of the 
National Assembly from Oudomsai Province and chief of the 
National Assembly Secretariat Commission; Dr. Khamliang 
Phonsena, member of the National Assembly from Champassak 
Province and chief of the National Assembly Commission for 
Foreign Relations; and other prominent figures. 
  The Thai parliamentary delegation's visit to the LPDR is the 
first of its kind in the 18 years since the establishment of the 
LPDR. The visit, therefore, is an auspicious sign for the 
further development and strengthening of the longstanding 
relations between the two countries of Laos and Thailand, 
especially between their legislative branches. The Thai 
delegation's visit to the LPDR will last three days. While they 
are in Laos, the parliamentary delegations from the two 
countries will meet to discuss issues of mutual concern. After 
that, the Thai delegation will pay courtesy calls on Lao party 
and state leaders and visit three economic and cultural 
establishments in Vientiane.

  [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued 
the following statement on 31 January in connection with the 
United States overturning [twijibo opkko innun] the DPRK-U.S. 
agreement for the peaceful solution of the nuclear problem on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  The statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman: 
  The process of the peaceful solution of the nuclear problem 
on the Korean peninsula now faces a grave challenge. The United 
States is creating a grave crisis which can lead the situation 
to a catastrophe [paguk] at a decisive juncture when the 
DPRK-U.S. talks can be rescued from a stalemate and when the 
prospects are opened for a package solution of the nuclear 
problem. 
  As is known, the DPRK and the United States agreed toward 
the 
end of last year that they will hold a third round of talks, 
that the United States will stop the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise for 1994, and that we will accept a limited inspection 
[hanjongdoen pomwiui sachal] necessary to ensure the continuity 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards on 
our nuclear sites, as a present measure for a package solution 
of the nuclear problem. Accordingly, with extraordinary 
patience and utmost broadmindedness within the framework of the 
DPRK-U.S. agreement, we have discussed with the IAEA Secretariat 
the scope of the inspection for ensuring the continuity of the 
safeguards. 
  However, the IAEA Secretariat intentionally ignored our 
special position of tentatively suspending the validation of 
the withdrawal [haengmugi chonpa pangji choyak taltoe hyoryok 
palsaengul imsi chongji sikin] from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT], and foolishly attempted to realize an overall 
inspection [chonmyon sachal] which is comparable to returning to 
the treaty [choyak pokkwie manmongnun], which could be settled 
through the DPRK-U.S. talks in the future, rather than an 
inspection to ensure the continuity of the safeguards. This not 
only clearly contradicts the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement, 
but also is a matter which cannot even become an object of 
discussion at all at this time when the U.S. nuclear threat, 
which brought about our withdrawal from the treaty, remains 
unremoved, and when the issue of the IAEA's partiality remains 
unresolved. 
  This notwithstanding, the United States, the party to the 
talks, instead of making efforts to correct the improper steps 
of the IAEA Secretariat, has completely reversed the promise on 
conducting inspections in order to purely guarantee the 
continuity of the nuclear safeguards accord. Rather, the United 
States is officially urging us to accept the full-scale 
inspections [chonmyon sachal] which the IAEA Secretariat has put 
forward. 
  Worse still, the United States has set a time limit and is 
assuming an ultimatum-like attitude that if we do not accept the 
IAEA's demand, the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks cannot be 
held and it cannot but take the road to impose sanctions against 
the DPRK. 
  What is graver is that by once again bringing up the issue 
of 
conducting special inspections of two military sites which have 
nothing to do with our nuclear activity, the United States 
stands in the van of the international-pressure commotions 
against us. This is a brazen-faced betrayal of the party to the 
dialogue. 
  After all, it becomes clear that the fact the United States 
has been busy talking about the solution of the nuclear issue 
through talks is a delaying tactic to make a pretext to crush us 
and to buy time needed for this. 
  The United States' anti-Republic crushing maneuvers are 
clearly shown in a new war-provocation maneuver which has been 
sought in the behind-the-scenes DPRK-U.S. talks. Contrary to 
its repeated promise of not using armed forces, including 
nuclear weapons, and of not making a threat through armed 
forces, the United States is persistently trying to conduct a 
large-scale nuclear war exercise against our Republic, including 
the Team Spirit joint military exercise. 
  U.S. official circles are now saying that if the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise cannot be conducted, they plan to 
continue another joint military exercise against the DPRK and 
are openly raving that if the exercise cannot be held in South 
Korea, it should be held even in Hawaii. 
  We have raised the issue of discontinuing the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise as a major agenda in the DPRK-U.S. 
dialogue. This is aimed not at taking off the signboards of the 
military exercise but at basically removing the U.S. nuclear 
threat against us. 
  While enforcing the nuclear war exercise against the 
dialogue 
partner, the United States assumes the impudent attitude of 
claiming that the nuclear issue be resolved. This cannot but be 
a mockery of us and a negation of the dialogue itself. 
  In particular, what cannot be overlooked is that U.S. 
hard-line conservative forces are full-fledgedly hurrying to 
deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea as one of the attempts to 
gain military supremacy over us. 
  There is no one who believes that the United States--which 
employs a smile strategy as if it were interested in withdrawing 
the nuclear weapons at talks and which runs wild to deploy 
Patriot missiles against the partners behind the scenes--has the 
will to resolve issues. 
  This nonetheless, the U.S. State Department spokesman's 
sophistry that the deployment of missiles cannot be regarded as 
a provocation of us can be said to be extremely brazen-faced. 
  The United States' reckless, new war-provocation maneuvers 
do 
not end here. The U.S. Administration dispatched the director of 
the Central Intelligence Agency to South Korea early in the new 
year and made a plot to strengthen intelligence gathering on the 
North. This strongly implies a full-fledged stage of the 
maneuvers for war preparations. It is not difficult to think 
that the United States will take a road to find a pretext to 
enter a practical military activity. 
  Considering the facts, it becomes obvious to everyone that 
the fact that the IAEA Secretariat has premeditatedly delayed 
negotiations with us, waited for the monitoring cameras' film 
and batteries to run out, and made the attempt of full-scale 
inspections by means of a collusive method of additional 
inspections [chuga sachal] is a premeditated U.S. strategy. 
  All facts clearly show that the United States has no will to 
peacefully resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and 
invariably seeks its inner intention to crush our Republic 
through strength. 
  Regarding the current emergency situation [uigi sanghwang] 
evoked by the mean and extremely dangerous traitorous acts of 
the United States, the DPRK Foreign Ministry solemnly declares 
its position as follows: 
  First, in the event the United States reverses the promise 
made with us, we no longer are bound to the promise made with 
the United States [miguki uriwa han yaksokul kkunnae twijipo 
omnundamyon urido toisang migukkwa han yaksoge kusoktoeji 
anulgosida]. 
  The promises we made with the United States include all the 
steps and commitments of good will, such as suspending the 
validation of the withdrawal from the NPT, freezing all nuclear 
activities, and abandoning the graphite-moderated nuclear 
reactor system, which we have unilaterally made for the 
U.S.-DPRK talks and for the peaceful solution of the nuclear 
problem. 
  Second, if the United States does not want the DPRK-U.S. 
talks, we are not in a position to insist on them. It is a 
great miscalculation [kodaran osan] if the United States thinks 
the DPRK-U.S. talks is any gift to us. The reason we 
consistently insisted on negotiations with the United States 
from the first stage of the emergence of the nuclear issue was 
to peacefully resolve the nuclear issue, not because we wanted 
anything from the United States. 
  We have lived up to now without relations with the United 
States, and we can and will live on ever so. 
  Third, in the event the United States wants to make any 
other 
choice, we will also choose the reciprocal countermeasure. [kue 
sangunghanun taeung pangdo] The right of choice is not only 
that of the big countries. The U.S. hard-line, conservative 
forces should take all responsibility for the catastrophic 
situation that could come about. The South Korean authorities, 
who are thoughtlessly following this, can never be free from 
this responsibility. 
  [Dated] 31 January, 1994, Pyongyang

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- U.S. Trade representative 
Mickey Kantor arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday [1 February] in a bid 
to break the deadlock in bilateral trade talks prior to the 
February 11 Washington summit between Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. Kantor, traveling with W. 
Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic 
policy, is scheduled to meet with Hosokawa, Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata and other key cabinet ministers on Wednesday and 
Thursday. 
  Bilateral negotiations on automobile trade, government 
procurement and other issues have been deadlocked over U.S. 
demands for rules to measure progress in foreign access to 
Japan's markets. The two countries are scheduled to hold 
subcabinet-level negotiations on key pending issues in Tokyo on 
Friday and Saturday. 
  U.S. officials have said Washington hopes that a 
breakthrough 
in the framework trade talks will lead to increased U.S. exports 
to Japan and a significant reduction in Japan's vast trade 
surplus, which last year topped 120 billion dollars worldwide.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Japanese Ambassador to the 
United States Takakazu Kuriyama told Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Tuesday [1 February] the United States has taken a 
"very tough stance" in its "framework" economic talks with 
Japan, government officials said. 
  Kuriyama, who is back in Japan temporarily, made the remark 
in discussions with Hosokawa in advance of the prime minister's 
summit talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on February 11 in 
Washington. 
  Economic issues such as easier U.S. access to Japanese 
Government procurement orders as well as to the auto and 
insurance markets are expected to be high on the summit agenda. 
  Kuriyama, however, was quoted as saying Washington has a 
good 
impression of the cabinet of Hosokawa. 
  Hosokawa staked his political fate on a controversial 
package 
of political reform bills which cleared the Diet on Saturday. 
The four bills introduce major changes in the electoral system 
for the House of Representatives and tighten controls over 
political donations to politicians. 
  In a related development, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday in an attempt to break the 
deadlock in the bilateral talks prior to the summit talks. 
  Hosokawa will leave for the United States on Thursday night 
and return home Sunday after his meeting with Clinton.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Japan will never accept a 
U.S. demand to set numerical targets to measure the progress of 
foreign access to Japanese markets, Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata said Tuesday [1 February]. Hata told a news conference 
"such criteria run counter to Japanese Government efforts to 
promote deregulation." 
  Trade negotiators from Japan and the United States who met 
in 
Washington last week made little progress on the critical issue 
of how to measure the progress of foreign access to Japanese 
markets. 
  Speaking at a news conference after the day's cabinet 
session, the foreign minister suggested that U.S. and Japanese 
automakers hold negotiations to break the impasse in bilateral 
auto trade talks over the share of U.S. cars in the Japanese 
market. Hata said talks among those directly involved would be 
more effective than government-level meetings in solving 
problems and suggested that the private sectors of both sides 
hold discussions. 
  Noting that Japanese automakers in the United States have 
tie-ups with local repair shops, Hata said that through such 
private-level talks, the U.S. firms wanting to sell cars in 
Japan might be able to seek alliances with Japanese makers. He 
cited as an example foreign beer companies selling their 
products through Japanese brewers. 
  The Japanese auto market, which Washington maintains is 
biased against imports, is the main focus of current U.S. 
efforts to cut down its trade deficit with Japan by increasing 
the sales of U.S. goods and services in key Japanese market 
sectors. 
  Japanese and U.S. negotiators on auto trade are deeply 
divided on how to quantify "tangible progress" in foreign access 
to the Japanese market, which the U.S. views as the core of the 
framework trade talks.

  [Text] Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Fishing 
cooperatives and marine product companies in northern Hokkaido 
formed a new group Tuesday [1 February] to thrash out safety 
measures in light of an increasing number of visits by Russian 
ships. 
  The 27 cooperatives and companies set up a coordinating 
office for the new group in the maritime safety agency's office 
in Wakkanai on the northern tip of Hokkaido. 
  The consultative body will consider safety measures with 
regard to all foreign ships visiting Wakkanai port, but focusing 
on Russian ships. Many of them lack shipowners' liability 
insurance to pay for damages and rescue costs. 
  The group will also distribute Russian language pamphlets, 
noting sites near the port where water is shallow and containing 
information as to where repair work can be carried out. 
  It will also coordinate the quick provision of rescue 
equipment when called for. 
  Visits by Russian ships have rapidly increased in parallel 
with growing contacts between Japanese in Hokkaido, the 
northernmost of Japan's four main islands, and Russians on 
Sakhalin island, which is directly north. 
  Last year, 1,323 foreign ships made port calls at Wakkanai, 
surpassing for the first time the number of such ships visiting 
Otaru, a major Hokkaido port. Some 97 percent of the foreign 
ships visiting Wakkanai were Russian.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Japan and Russia have 
abandoned the use of a chemical tanker for the storage of liquid 
radioactive waste that might otherwise be dumped by the Russian 
Navy into the sea, government officials said Tuesday [1 
February]. The officials said the idea was dropped after it was 
discovered that the used chemical tanker under consideration 
might not be able to withstand the severe cold of the Russian 
Far East. 
  They said the two sides have subsequently begun considering 
the idea of Japan providing financial assistance for emergency 
disposal facilities. 
  Russia asked Japan in talks last December to help find a 
chemical tanker with a storage capacity of between 5,000 tons 
and 25,000 tons. Japan had introduced a 10,000-ton class 
Panamanian-registered tanker docked in Singapore. 
  But Russian inspectors determined that the tanker might not 
be able to withstand severe cold weather conditions and that its 
deck may not be thick enough to prevent adverse effects on the 
environment and on the health of the crew. 
  A 100 million dollar fund pledged by Tokyo to Moscow to help 
it scrap its obsolete nuclear weapons is expected to be utilized 
toward the alternative facilities. 
  Russia last dumped 900 tons of low-level radioactive waste 
into the Sea of Japan on October 17. It suspended a planned 
second dumping following international protests, particularly 
from Japan and South Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
Tuesday [1 February] brushed aside a reported move toward the 
possession of nuclear weapons and renewed a commitment to its 
long-held nonnuclear policy. 
  "Our country has been maintaining three nonnuclear 
principles 
and our use of nuclear energy is limited to peaceful purposes," 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference. "It is impossible for us to develop nuclear 
weapons," the top government spokesman said. 
  Japan has long adhered to a policy of not possessing or 
producing nuclear weapons or allowing them into Japan. 
  Takemura's comment was intended to refute reports by a 
British newspaper that Tokyo might alter its nonnuclear policy 
and opt to possess nuclear weapons. The SUNDAY TIMES reported 
Sunday that Britain's Defense Ministry has warned Prime Minister 
John Major that North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
development program may compel Japan to give up its nonnuclear 
policy. 
  Takemura said the British Government has acknowledged it has 
no reason to doubt Japan's nonnuclear stand. 
  He also denied a report carried Monday by another British 
paper, THE INDEPENDENT, that Tokyo plans to develop 
intercontinental ballistic missiles in connection with its 
imminent launching of the first all-Japanese satellite-launch 
rocket. "I want to emphasize our nation's space development 
activities are strictly limited to peaceful purposes," Takemura 
noted.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa has sent a letter to Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk 
urging that the former Soviet Republic become a nuclear-free 
country as soon as possible, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke 
Terada said Tuesday [1 February]. Japanese Ambassador to 
Ukraine Shoji Suezawa handed Hosokawa's written message to 
Nikolay Makarevych, Ukraine's first vice foreign minister, 
Terada said. 
  In the letter, Hosokawa gave high marks to a recent 
trilateral accord among Ukraine, Russia and the United States in 
which Ukraine pledged to give up its nuclear arms. He also 
urged Kravchuk to implement the accord as soon as possible, 
Terada said. 
  Hosokawa called on Ukraine to ratify the Strategic Arms 
Reduction Treaty (START I) unconditionally and accede to the 
nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as a nonnuclear state, the 
spokesman said. 
  He also said Ukraine's participation in the "Partnership for 
Peace," endorsed by the leaders of North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) in Brussels last month, is meaningful in 
enhancing global security. The plan is intended to bring former 
Warsaw Pact adversaries into a limited partnership with the 
Western Military Alliance. 
  Hosokawa's letter also expressed Japan's strong expectations 
that Ukraine will further promote efforts for economic 
development, Terada said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Japan hopes to directly ask 
about the Russian situation and policy at a planned meeting of 
finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven 
(G-7) leading nations in Germany in late February, a senior 
Finance Ministry official said Tuesday [1 February]. The

the G-7 meeting, has shown interest in discussing the Russian 
issue but Japan has not yet received any notice about inviting a 
Russian delegation, he said. 
  Meanwhile, the official said arrangements are now being made 
for Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to meet U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor who arrived in Tokyo later Tuesday. 
  Fujii intends to meet Kantor if his schedule allows, he 
said. 
  On the ongoing negotiations on insurance service -- one of 
the top priorities under the Japan-U.S. "framework" trade talks, 
the official said further talks are needed ahead of the February 
11 summit of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill 
Clinton. 
  The two sides are reportedly at odds over an objective 
criteria with Japan refusing U.S. demand for quantitative 
criteria that can be interpreted as numerical targets in market 
access. The official said the criteria could be something 
different for each field. 
  On the macroeconomic field, the official stressed that it is 
for review by reporting each other's measures and not for 
negotiations. "The U.S. side recognizes it, and this is also 
how the macroeconomic field is taken at G-7 meetings," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's cabinet decided Tuesday [1 February] to upgrade the 
existing Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman (OTO) to an 
enlarged body, to deal with complaints about trade barriers. 
  The new organization will consist of cabinet ministers 
instead of vice administrative ministers, as was formerly the 
case with the OTO. The prime minister will serve as chief of 
the new body. 
  The upgrading of the OTO is in line with a proposal made 
last 
December by a government advisory panel that the OTO be expanded 
to deal more efficiently with trade complaints.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Major Japanese steelmakers 
have received a series of Chinese orders for massive imports of 
seamless steel pipes for oil drilling, industry sources said 
Monday [31 January]. 
  China has already ordered about 100,000 tons of the material 
from Nippon Steel Corp., NKK Corp., Sumitomo Metal Industries 
Ltd. and Kawasaki Steel Corp. for deliveries in the 
February-July period, compared with actual shipments of 120,000 
tons a year earlier, they said. 
  There is speculation in the industry that Chinese orders for 
the half year will rise to a level of 150,000 to 200,000 tons. 
  Increased exports in the coming months are likely to bolster 
the Japanese steelmakers' money-losing seamless pipe 
manufacturing operations, the sources said. 
  Despite booming exports of ordinary rolled steel to China, 
Japan's seamless pipe exports to the country have been sluggish 
in recent years, falling to a range of 150,000 to 200,000 tons 
from a peak of about 700,000 tons in the half-year period of 
1985. 
  The sources attributed the active Chinese orders to a series 
of oil development projects in China's inland areas and a 
reduction in Chinese stocks of the material. 
  Japan, which exports more than 70 percent of its seamless 
steel pipe production, has been losing money on the operations 
due to the yen's appreciation on the foreign exchange market.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 30 KYODO -- One of the nine extremists 
who hijacked a Japan Airlines [JAL] flight to Pyongyang in 1970 
made a publicized appeal to allow his daughter to return to 
Japan, a group sympathetic to the hijackers said Sunday [30 
January]. The letter from Takahiro Konishi, 49, who lives in 
the North Korean capital, appeared in the January 29 edition of 
a newsletter put out by the group. 
  He wrote that he wants his 16-year-old eldest daughter, who 
is without nationality, "to study together with her Japanese 
friends in the land of her ancestors." 
  Konishi is the sixth hijacker to indicate he wants to return 
to Japan. It is the first time that a letter bearing the 
hijacker's actual name was sent to Japan. 
  Nine former Sekigun-ha (Red Army faction) extremists 
hijacked 
the JAL Boeing-727 airliner and its crew of seven and 122 
passengers on a flight from Tokyo to Fukuoka. 
  The plane landed in Seoul, where the passengers were 
released, and continued on to Pyongyang, where the hijackers 
defected. 
  Konishi also thanked the sympathizers' group for their 
letters and gifts, and wrote he "was able to understand the 
warmness of (Japanese) relatives" at a meeting three and a half 
years ago in Pyongyang. 
  Konishi said that the meeting clarified his feelings and he 
was certain he would return to Japan. 
  The seven families of the hijackers include 17 children, and 
the sympathizers have been campaigning to acquire Japanese 
nationality and passports for them so that they can return to 
Japan. 
  Konishi said that if it is possible, he wants to send his 
oldest daughter and her 14-year-old sister to Japan this summer.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- Japan agreed with Vietnam 
on Friday [28 January] to extend a loan of 52.3 billion yen and 
a grant-in-aid of 853 million yen, Foreign Ministry officials 
said. 
  The Japanese Government pledged the loan at an international 
conference on aid to Vietnam held in Paris last November. 
  Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Hiroyuki Yushita and 
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam exchanged documents 
on the loan and the grant in Hanoi, the officials said. 
  The loan is for seven projects to improve infrastructure 
related to power supply and transportation, and to pay for 
equipment to repair roads and waterworks, they said. 
  The aid is to support Vietnam's efforts at economic reform 
and to shift to a market-oriented economy under its policy of 
"doi moi" or renovation, they said. 
  Japan will also grant 788 million yen for Can Tho University 
in southern Vietnam to improve its agriculture department. The 
money will be used to build facilities and to pay for equipment. 
  Another grant of 65 million yen will be used for a project 
to 
improve waterworks in northeastern Hanoi.

  [Text] Nagoya, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Toyota Motor Corp. said 
Thursday [27 January] it has agreed with German automaker 
Volkswagen AG to extend their contract to make commercial 
vehicles in Germany. 
  Under the contract due to expire at the end of 1994, Toyota 
and Volkswagen have turned out Toyota's Hilux model and 
Volkswagen's Taro based on the Hilux at a Volkswagen factory in 
Hannover since 1989. 
  Toyota said the extended contract will be valid until the 
currently produced models give way to new ones, but that it is 
not yet decided whether to extend it again after that time. 
  The Hannover factory produced some 9,000 units last year and 
expects to keep production volume unchanged from last year's 
level in light of a weak European auto market.

  [Text] Nagoya, Jan. 31 KYODO -- The Nagoya District Court 
on Monday [31 January] rejected a suit by eight Pakistanis to be 
recognized as refugees, claiming they feared religious 
persecution as members of the minority Ahmadi Sect of Islam if 
forced to return home. 
  Presiding Judge Yoji Okahisa rejected the suit by ruling 
that 
"In Pakistan there is no objective reason to fear persecution, 
so refugee status does not apply." 
  "The domestic situation is such that no criminal penalties 
would be applied aside from using the name of Islam publicly," 
the court decided. 
  The six men and two women had filed suit against the justice 
minister to be recognized as refugees by the Japanese 
Government, saying they feared persecution for their religious 
activities in Pakistan. 
  In 1984, the Pakistani Government pronounced a law that 
prohibited the Ahmadi Sect from identifying itself with Islam 
and including criminal penalties for religious activities. 
  The eight plaintiffs arrived in Japan in 1988 with the help 
of the sect's Nagoya branch office. Claiming that they feared 
being arrested if they returned to Pakistan, the eight applied 
for refugee status with Nagoya immigration authorities, 
receiving an extension to stay in Japan while waiting for a 
decision. Immigration authorities decided, however, there was 
no concrete evidence of persecution. 
  Meanwhile, the extensions to their visas expired while they 
pleaded their case from 1990 to 1992 in a series of suits.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Japan will extend 10 million 
dollars to cooperate in a United Nations program to reconstruct 
Somalia's police and judicial system, the Foreign Ministry said 
Tuesday [1 February]. 
  Japan pledged the amount at a U.N.-sponsored meeting in 
Nairobi on the establishment of an organization to coordinate 
assistance to Somalia, the ministry said. 
  The government will provide the assistance considering the 
urgent need to reconstruct Somalia's police and judicial system 
and establish a system to maintain public order and restore 
peace by the Somali people themselves, it said. 
  The U.N. Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II), currently 
deployed 
to maintain the public order and secure safety of humanitarian 
assistance activities, announced last October a program to 
reconstruct the local police and judicial system. 
  The U.N. is calling on member countries to cooperate in the 
program, the ministry said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2239 GMT on 29 January, in its regularly-scheduled 
"News 2001" program, carries a 28-minute interview with Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, and head of Sakigake 
(Harbinger Party). The live interview, conducted in an Asahi 
Television studio in Tokyo, and moderated by newscasters Yuji 
Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama, is joined from time to time by 
regular guest commentators Kenichi Takemura, columnist, and 
Yoshiaki Kobayashi, a professor at Keio University. 
  Kuroiwa begins the interview by asking Takemura to comment 
on 
the view that the Prime Minister's Office and coalition leaders, 
such as Ichiro Ozawa, worked in harmony for the first time in a 
long time to have the political reform bills approved. Takemura 
says: "The five representatives of the ruling parties, 
including Ozawa, were in charge of contacting the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). In a different sense, the Prime 
Minister's Office, or the government, was also in contact with 
the LDP. Rather than saying we acted in concert, I should say 
the LDP's responses to us changed significantly. Both sides 
were feeling good about the situation. There were almost no 
differences of opinion within the ruling parties, and the only 
thing we had in mind was to reach an agreement with the LDP. 
Because of this, everything went well." 
  Asked to explain when the political reform compromise 
package 
will be enacted, Takemura answers: "The preamble of the 
memorandum states that the revised bills will be approved before 
we start deliberations on the original fiscal 1994 budget at the 
next ordinary Diet session, which will start tomorrow (31 
January). They will probably be approved before the end of 
February. An enforcement date will be decided at that time." 
  Regarding the contents of the package, and particularly 
corporate contributions of political funds, Takemura explains 
the significance of the agreement is that a politician will 
designate a single fund-raising organization to which donations 
can be paid, and the maximum amount of a corporate contribution 
will be reduced to 500,000 yen per annum. 
  Pointing out that the recent agreement is just the first 
step 
toward political reform, Kobayashi asks Takemura if he is 
already thinking about the next step. In response, Takemura 
says: "The task we have to buckle down to is upper house 
reform. Reform of the local electoral systems is another task." 
  Matsuyama asks if the gap between the Social Democratic 
Party 
of Japan (SDPJ) and other coalition parties has widened. 
Takemura answers: "The SDPJ made bold decisions one after 
another to support the Hosokawa administration. I think the 
Hosokawa administration survived the past six months and was 
able to challenge several major tasks thanks to the SDPJ's 
series of bold compromises. However, the bitter processes in 
the decision-making within the SDPJ were reported vividly so it 
appeared to the public as if the existence of the SDPJ itself in 
the coalition was a problem." 
  As for the possibility of policy cooperation with the LDP in 
the future, Takemura says: "We should make the recent agreement 
an occasion to change the harsh relations of the past between 
the ruling and opposition parties. The LDP members have said 
from the beginning they would make the LDP a healthy opposition 
party. We seriously listen to the opinions of the opposition 
party." On the possibility of including the LDP in the 
coalition, Takemura says: "We still have not talked about it at 
all." Takemura also rules out the possibility of uniting all 
political parties into two major parties. However, he admits 
there is a movement among the ruling parties -- between Sakigake 
and a SDPJ group led by former SDPJ Secretary General Akamatsu, 
for example -- to hold joint study sessions. 
  On the possibility of uniting Sakigake with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's Japan New Party, Takemura says: "I think it is only 
a matter of time." 
  After briefly discussing the contents of a book Takemura 
wrote recently, moderator Matsuyama asks Takemura to explain 
what he meant by describing Japan as a country that is small but 
"shines." Takemura explains that, in the international 
community, Japan is perceived by many to be small because it 
does not make sufficient international contributions in 
nonmilitary areas, including environmental protection and 
fighting against drug trafficking, but it does stand out as a 
country. 
  Returning to the issue of reorganizing the political world 
under the new electoral system, Takemura says: "We cleared the 
first hurdle yesterday. We need to make some amendments in the 
future. However, we politicians are seriously thinking about how 
we will win elections under the new system. It is an 
instinctive reaction. This mean that serious discussions on 
reorganization of the political world will start soon. I think 
it is inevitable." 
  Asked when the new electoral system will become effective, 
Takemura says: "Around this fall at the earliest, if the lower 
house is dissolved. However, we still have three and half more 
years before our term of office runs out." 
  On the possibility of reorganizing the political world 
within 
this year, Takemura answers: "I think we have a 100 percent 
possibility of reorganizing the political world before the next 
election."

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- The following were details 
of the political reform compromise package signed early Saturday 
[29 January] between the ruling coalition of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. 
The compromise makes it likely the Diet will now approve the 
government's reform bills during its Saturday session. 
<H5>  (House of Representatives) </H5>
  The lower house would have 500 seats, compared with 511 at 
present. This would include 300 from single-seat electoral 
districts and 200 chosen by proportional representation. 
  The coalition originally proposed a combination of 274 
single- seat constituencies and 226 chosen by proportional 
representation. 
<H5>  (Voting) </H5>
  Voters would cast two ballots, one for a single-seat 
representative and another for a party on the proportional list 
divided into 11 regional blocs. 
  The coalition originally proposed candidates for the 
proportional representation seats be chosen from a single 
nationwide list. 
<H5>  (Party Fund-Raising) </H5>
  A politician may designate a single fund-raising 
organization 
to which donations can be paid. Companies may contribute up to 
500,000 yen a year to an organization. The organizations would 
be banned after five years. 
  The coalition originally proposed an immediate ban on 
company 
donations to politicians' support groups. 
<H5>  (Political Parties) </H5>
  A party must poll at least 2 percent of the proportional 
representation vote to qualify to win a seat. 
  Under existing regulations, the figure is 3 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- Science and Technology 
Agency Director General Satsuki Eda, head of the minor United 
Social Democratic Party (USDP), said Saturday [29 January] he 
and USDP Secretary General Shogo Abe will join the parliamentary 
alliance of Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Japan New Party (JNP). 
  Eda and Abe said they will join the Sakigake-JNP group in 
the 
next regular Diet session due to open Monday. The two men 
expressed their intentions in a meeting of legislators belonging 
to the parliamentary group. 
  To pursue the new political alliance, Eda and Abe on 
Saturday 
left a parliamentary group comprised of members of the USDP and 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the leading component in the 
ruling coalition. 
  The USDP, formed in March 1978 after bolting from the SDP, 
holds four seats in the powerful House of Representatives. 
Another USDP lower house member, Naoto Kan, has already joined 
the Sakigake-JNP. 
  Yanosuke Narazaki, the other lower house legislator, is 
expected to remain in the SDP-USDP group to maintain ties 
between the two parties. Hideo Den, the USDP's only upper house 
member, left the party Monday. 
  The USDP joined six other parties last August to form the 
coalition government, ousting the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
from a 38-year grip on power. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, meanwhile, said Saturday 
that his own JNP will not merge with Sakigake in the next 
regular Diet session as initially envisioned. 
  Hosokawa said in a news conference after Diet approval of 
the 
government's political reform package that there would not be 
any problem if the two parties do not rush to get together. A 
top official of Sakigake, headed by Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura, also denied the possibility of the two 
parties' early merger.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Two top leaders of the 
minor United Social Democratic Party (USDP) joined the Sakigake 
[Harbinger]-Japan New Party (JNP) alliance Monday [31 January]. 
  USDP Chief Satsuki Eda, now director general of the Science 
and Technology Agency, and the party's secretary general, Shogo 
Abe, left the lower house alliance between the USDP and the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) on Saturday. 
  Eda has said the USDP will be dissolved as a result of the 
likely realignment in Japanese politics following Saturday's 
passage of reform bills in the Diet. The USDP, formed in 1978 
after splitting from the SDP, holds four seats in the lower 
house. 
  Another USDP lower house member, Naoto Kan, has already 
joined the Sakigake-JNP and became a formal member of the 
alliance on Monday. Yanosuke Narazaki, the other USDP lower 
house legislator, is expected to remain in the SDP-USDP group to 
maintain ties between the two parties. 
  Hideo Den, the USDP's only upper house member, left the 
party 
on December 24. 
  The distribution of seats in the 511-seat lower house now 
looks as follows -- Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 222, SDP-USDP 
74, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 61, Sakigake-JNP 55, Komeito 
[Clean Government Party] 52, Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) 
19, Japanese Communist Party (JCP) 15, Kaikakuonokai (Reform 
Group) five, and independents eight. 
  Meanwhile, the LDP notified the House of Councillors that 
three upper house members have left the party. 
  Ichiji Ishii, Yamato Kogure and Tomoichi Hoshino left the 
LDP 
after voting for the government's political reform bills in the 
upper house on December 21, defying the party's decision to vote 
against the bills. 
  A compromise version of the bills was enacted into law in 
the 
lower house on Saturday. 
  An upper house alliance of the JNP, Shinseito and the 
Democratic Reform Party (DRP) has given notice that the three 
LDP defectors have joined their group. 
  As a result, in the 252-seat upper house, the LDP has 96 
seats, the SDP 73, the JNP, Shinseito and the DRP 26, Komeito 
24, the DSP 11, the JCP 11, the Niin Club five and independents 
six.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Seiroku Kajiyama, a 
powerful Diet member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), sued the ASAHI SHIMBUN on Monday [31 January], demanding 
100 million yen in damages over reports he received 10 million 
yen from a construction firm. 
  The lawsuit, filed with the Tokyo District Court, also 
demands the mass-circulation daily publish an apology. 
  The written petition of the suit said the reports libeled 
Kajiyama, 67, an LDP House of Representatives member, and were 
detrimental to his credibility. 
  On January 9, the ASAHI SHIMBUN carried a front-page story 
that Mitsui Construction Co. gave 10 million yen to Kajiyama to 
gain his influence in obtaining a public works contract. 
  The money was handed over around the spring of 1991 after a 
Kajiyama representative allegedly asked then Ibaraki Gov. Fujio 
Takeuchi to favor Mitsui Construction in bids for a 25 billion 
yen dam project, the article said. 
  The ASAHI said Takeuchi, 76, related the transaction to the 
Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, which is investigating 
a series of scandals involving politicians and general 
contractors over public works projects. 
  Mitsui Construction asked the Kajiyama side to exert 
influence on the governor so that the dam contract would be 
awarded to the company, the report said. 
  Also on January 14, the paper reported that prosecutors 
began 
questioning executives of Mitsui Construction in connection with 
the suspected payment to Kajiyama. 
  Lawyers for Kajiyama released a statement Monday that he 
never requested nor received money from the Tokyo-based 
construction firm. Kajiyama himself will soon hold a press 
conference to prove his innocence on the issue, his office said. 
  The lawyers also criticized the Tokyo District Public 
Prosecutors Office for leaking false information to ASAHI 
SHIMBUN reporters. 
  According to the lawyers, Kajiyama has decided not to file a 
complaint against the prosecutors office over the alleged leak, 
saying the case will not be investigated fairly. 
  Tetsuzo Hori, head of the City News Department of the 
ASAHI's 
Tokyo headquarters, said the reports are based on sufficient 
coverage and the paper is confident they are true. 
  Kajiyama, elected eight times since 1969 from Ibaraki 
Prefecture's No. 2 Constituency where the dam is to be built, 
has served as home affairs minister, international trade and 
industry minister, and justice minister. 
  For two years from December 1990, Kajiyama was the LDP's 
chief parliamentary strategist as chairman of the Diet Affairs 
Committee. He later served as LDP secretary general between 
December 1992 and last August. 
  Takeuchi was indicted last year for allegedly taking a total 
of 95 million yen in bribes from major contractors Hazama Corp., 
Shimizu Corp., Kajima Corp. and Tobishima Corp. 
  A former vice president of Mitsui Construction is on trial 
for allegedly giving a 10 million yen bribe to former Sendai 
Mayor Toru Ishii.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Shuntaro Honma, former 
governor of Miyagi Prefecture, pleaded not guilty Monday [31 
January] to charges he took a 20 million yen bribe from 
construction giant Taisei Corp. while he was in office. 
  Honma, at his first court hearing, said he neither was 
offered the 20 million yen from Taisei last year, nor received 
any money. 
  Prosecutors said Honma, 53, took the cash in late January in 
exchange for giving Japan's second biggest contractor the tender 
for a cancer center worth billions of yen. They said the money 
also was intended as a sweetener for future public works in 
Miyagi, about 340 kilometers northwest of Tokyo. 
  Mitsuo Moriya, 65, a Honma aide charged with playing an 
intermediary role, admitted receiving the money but denied it 
was a bribe for Honma. Moriya was a senior member of the 
Liberal Democratic Party's Miyagi chapter. 
  Three former Taisei executives who were also indicted said 
in 
the hearing that they gave the 20 million yen to Honma to help 
him win reelection. They also said that they implicitly 
expected him to act in favor of the company in awarding 
contracts for public works projects. 
  The three executives are former Vice President Takashi 
Hashimoto, 57, Koji Amada, 53, former head of the firm's Tohoku 
branch and his predecessor Takaaki Wada, 57. 
  Their attorney asked the court for leniency, saying his 
clients would not contest the charges. 
  Honma was arrested in September along with Moriya, Wada and 
Amada. Hashimoto was arrested later. 
  Honma stepped down in October, half way through his 
four-year 
second term. He has been held at Tokyo detention house. 
  The former Miyagi governor also has been charged with 
pocketing 100 million yen in bribes from disgraced business 
tycoon Ryoei Saito, 77, former honorary chairman of Daishowa 
Paper Mfg. Co. 
  On this occasion, Moriya apparently acted as intermediary 
for 
Honma in channeling the bribe. Daishowa, which also has 
interests in a golf course and housing projects in Miyagi, was 
implicated in December 1991. 
  Two governors and two mayors stand trial in a series of 
bribery scandals centering on eight of the country's leading 
construction companies. 
  In mid-January, prosecutors arrested two executives of 
another contractor, Obayashi Corp., on suspicion of bribery. 
That brings the number of construction officials implicated in 
the scandal since June to more than 20.
