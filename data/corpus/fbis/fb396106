  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will fashion a new medium-term program to overhaul the 
Japanese economy and make living conditions better, superseding 
the five-year program compiled under the previous 
administration, government sources said Sunday. The new program 
will be an expanded version of the program put forth in 1992 by 
the administration of then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to 
make Japan a "lifestyle superpower," the sources said. 
  Hosokawa's new plan will include an increase to the 430 
trillion yen in public works spending over ten years promised by 
Tokyo in 1990 to the United States during the bilateral 
structural impediments initiative (SII) talks. 
  The new scheme will also contain an actual spending list for 
enhancing the infrastructure, such as housing, parks, and 
telecommunications, they said. 
  Hosokawa will seek advice on the program from the economic 
council for compilation by the end of the year, they said. 
  By telling President Bill Clinton about the new plan in 
their 
summit meeting on February 11, Hosokawa hopes to induce an 
expression of appreciation from the U.S. on Japan's efforts to 
boost its domestic demand and thereby slash its mammoth trade 
surplus. Hosokawa is also expected to present to Clinton the 
government's new economic stimulus package that will include 5 
to 6 trillion yen worth of income and residence tax cuts. 
  Washington, in apparent frustration about the lack of 
progress in the current bilateral "framework" trade talks, 
successor to the SII talks, has been urging Japan to inject a 
strong and sustainable stimulus into the feeble economy. 
  Japan has vowed to reach market opening agreements in 
several 
priority sectors, such as autos, by the February summit. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said during his recent 
visit to Tokyo, "If we do not have credible agreements by the 
time of the summit, we would have to reexamine the basis of the 
framework ... we will not settle for any cosmetic agreement." 
  The Miyazawa program stipulated measures to enhance living 
standards, spelling out such goals as lowering the prices of 
houses and condominiums down to five times a salaried worker's 
annual income, and shortening an employee's annual working hours 
to 1,800 or below. 
  Hosokawa originally intended to inherit the Miyazawa plan, 
but changed his mind after his success in political reform 
raised the chances of a long tenure, the sources said. 
  The Hosokawa administration already received a call from a 
blue-ribbon advisory council to increase the government's public 
works expenditures. 
  In line with the November recommendations of the advisory 
group for economic restructuring, last November, Hosokawa's new 
economic program will contain steps to promote deregulation, a 
review on taxation and insurance systems in light of the aging 
population, and assistance to farmers following Japan's 
acceptance of the partial opening of the rice market. The 
measures spelled out in the premier's "vision for the 21st 
century," which he announced at the start of this year, will 
also be incorporated into the plan. 
  In the "vision," Hosokawa called for lowering housing costs 
by one third and tripling the per-capita park area.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- The Labor Ministry said 
Monday [31 January] that 12 manufacturing industries, including 
bag makers, will be eligible for the government's employment 
adjustment subsidy for one year from Tuesday. Under the 
existing system, employers will be provided with a subsidy to 
pay a portion of salaries and allowances to employees who are 
temporarily laid off because of the economic slowdown. 
  The ministry said the 12 industries to be added to the list 
include offshore oil drilling, felt manufacturing, polyurethane 
making and processing, refrigerating and air conditioning 
regulators manufacturing and electric welding machine 
manufacturing. 
  Seventeen other industries, including piano and its 
accessories manufacturing, were also re-designated as eligible, 
the ministry said. 
  It said the list will cover 4,856,000 workers in a total of 
233 categories of manufacturers.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Sales by wholesalers and 
retailers in 1993 dropped from the preceding year for the second 
straight year mainly because of sluggish corporate and personal 
consumption, the government said Monday [31 January]. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the 
sales index stood at 97.1 against the 1990 base of 100, down 4.0 
percentage points from the year before. 
  The index for the wholesale industry was down 4.1 percentage 
points while that for the retail business declined 3.8 points, 
the ministry said. 
  The ministry said sales by large-scale retailers such as 
trading houses plunged 5.3 points. 
  Sales and exports of durable products by wholesalers were 
sluggish due to slow production activity by the manufacturing 
industry, the ministry said. 
  In the retail category, all industries, including 
automobiles, foodstuffs, clothing and accessories, posted sales 
declines due to weak spending by corporations and individuals, 
it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Orders won in 1993 by 
Japan's 50 major construction companies totaled 19.73 trillion 
yen, an 18.2 percent fall from the previous year and the second 
consecutive yearly decline, the Construction Ministry announced 
Monday [31 January]. 
  The rate of decline was the greatest since the ministry 
started the annual surveys in 1961. 
  Ministry officials attributed the plunge chiefly to a 24.1 
percent fall in construction orders from the private sector to 
12.11 trillion yen -- the third straight yearly drop. 
  Orders from the manufacturing industries, centered on the 
automotive and food businesses, posted a 37.1 percent decrease, 
and those from the nonmanufacturing industries a 21.3 percent 
fall. 
  Orders from the public sector totaled 6.38 trillion yen, 
down 
7.1 percent for the first fall in eight years. 
  Authorities placed more orders with medium-sized and small 
construction companies and fewer orders with major firms 
following the uncovering last year of a series of bribery 
scandals involving general contractors and local government 
chiefs.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- The government and the 
ruling parties are set to include an income tax cut without 
tying it to a consumption tax hike in the economic stimulus 
package to be announced Thursday [3 February], government and 
party sources said Monday. 
  The sources said the tax cuts would total 6 trillion to 7 
trillion yen and be retroactive to January. 
  The splitting of the tax cut and consumption tax hike will 
be 
officially decided at a joint economic forum of the government 
and the coalition parties, the sources said. 
  The forum held a meeting Monday evening, and Deputy Prime 
Ministry Tsutomu Hata, who chairs the forum, told reporters 
after the meeting that a final decision will come by Wednesday. 
The decision, the sources said, will be to finance the cut in 
income and residential taxes by issuing short-term 
deficit-covering bonds. 
  But the Finance Ministry is continuing to insist on tying 
the 
income tax cut to a raise in the consumption tax rate, currently 
at 3 percent. 
  Given the ministry's insistence, the forum is to include a 
provision in the fiscal 1994 tax reform plan to "correct" the 
ratio of direct to indirect tax revenues in one or two years to 
fund the tax cut, the sources said. This means, in effect, 
hiking the consumption tax rate. 
  Hata said, "tax cuts without any future (funding) 
expectations are dangerous for the nation," indicating an 
consumption tax hike will be implemented in the future. 
  The sources said that to meet the antipathy of some in the 
coalition to any reference to a consumption tax, the forum is 
also considering stipulating that a fixed proportion of 
consumption tax revenue be used for social welfare, and 
recommend changing the name to a "welfare tax" or "livelihood 
tax." 
  The decision, if made as the sources predict, will mean a 
setback for the Finance Ministry, which has been insisting on 
inclusion of concrete timing and scale of a consumption tax hike 
as a "collateral" for repaying the deficit-covering bonds. 
  The Finance Ministry faced strong objections led by the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) -- The largest in the coalition -- 
to such a move from and the threat of shaking the coalition 
government if it pushed its demands too hard, the sources said. 
  A consumption tax hike would also be highly unpopular with 
the public at a time when the economy is so weak, and could also 
draw criticism from the United States, which is seeking strong 
measures to stimulate domestic demand to reduce Japan's huge 
trade surplus, they noted. 
  The Finance Ministry had insisted that the same fiscal 1994 
tax reform bills that specify the cuts also clearly spell out a 
hike in the consumption tax rate to around 7 percent from its 
current 3 percent, to be implemented in April next year. 
  But the SDP and Komeito [Clean Government Party], at 
Monday's 
meeting of coalition parties again opposed linking the income 
and residential tax cuts with the consumption tax increase, the 
sources said. 
  Meanwhile, some cabinet members at a meeting of government 
and coalition party leaders, called for reviewing the tax issue 
later under a broader policy to address the nation's aging 
society, taking into account the concerns of such people as 
fixed-income pensioners. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, although indicating he 
would leave it to the coalition how to handle the funding of the 
tax cuts, effectively made it difficult to include the tax hike 
by saying he wanted the tax issue decided Wednesday and included 
in Thursday's stimulus package, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Vice Finance Minister Jiro 
Saito hinted Monday [31 January] that his ministry may soften 
its stance on the issue of whether to deal together an income 
tax cut and a consumption tax hike. 
  "I have never explained the definition," Saito told a 
scheduled news conference. 
  He declined further comment, noting a joint economic forum 
of 
the government and ruling coalition parties was dealing with the 
tax issue. Saito said the ministry "will respect the decision 
made by the forum." 
  On the stock market that staged a sharp rally, Saito said 
there would be "no direct effects" on the state of the economy 
because market prices are determined by supply-demand conditions 
which do not necessarily reflect economic fundamentals.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- The government should 
propose an income tax cut in tandem with an increase in 
consumption tax, Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international 
trade and industry, said Tuesday [1 February]. 
  Kumagai told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting that 
the combination of an income tax cut and a consumption tax hike 
has been the fundamental notion of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's cabinet. 
  "It is up to the government and the ruling parties to make 
adjustments for combining the tax cut and the tax hike," he said. 
  Asked about the scale of income tax reduction, Kumagai said 
the cut should help quicken Japan's economic recovery and 
contribute to the global economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Economic Planning Agency 
Director General Manae Kubota hinted Tuesday [1 February] she 
favors a plan to separate the issue of a consumption tax hike 
from a reduction in income tax. 
  A proposal made by the government's Tax Commission last 
November on the tax issue appears to be focusing too much on the 
concept that the proposed income tax cuts should be financed by 
tax revenues, Kubota told a regular press conference. 
  The scope of such sources could be further expanded, Kubota 
said, citing the possibility of unexpected revenues emerging 
from "economic adjustment" under various proposals by an 
advisory body to the prime minister. 
  Kubota was referring to the easing of government controls 
proposed last year by the advisory group for economic 
restructuring. 
  The Tax Commission tends to think of everything only in 
terms 
of a tax framework, she explained, while the government advisory 
body has a broader framework that would create new business 
needs in the future. 
  Kubota's remarks came at a time when the ruling coalition 
parties and the Finance Ministry are engaged in a tug-of-war 
over how to finance the income tax cuts which are expected to be 
included in the government's new economic stimulus package 
Thursday. 
  The Finance Ministry, adamantly against issuing "untreated" 
deficit-financing bonds, or bonds not backed by financial 
sources to repay them, has proposed hiking the consumption tax 
rate from the current 3 percent. 
  The coalition parties are in disarray over the issue, 
chiefly 
due to strong opposition to the consumption tax raise from the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest of the seven-party 
coalition. 
  Kubota, an SDP member, said she hopes the coalition will 
reach a consensus that would lead to tax reforms which balance 
income and consumption taxes. 
  Kubota, the head of the agency that is responsible for 
formulating the economic package, refrained from specifying the 
size of the proposed income tax reductions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Cabinet members agreed with 
the Finance Ministry that a law to cut income taxes aimed at 
stimulating the economy must also contain a provision calling 
for an offsetting rise in the consumption tax, Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [1 February]. 
  Fujii told a regular press conference after the morning 
cabinet meeting that he asked cabinet members to "reaffirm" that 
the two be handled together and that there were "no objections." 
The issue has split government and ruling party leaders in 
recent days, with many calling for an early tax cut while 
leaving for the future the matter of how to pay for it. 
  Fujii also said he interpreted comments made Monday by 
Deputy 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to mean that a joint economic forum 
between the government and the coalition has "decided" that the 
tax cut and hike will be linked. 
  After a forum meeting, Hata told reporters that "tax cuts 
without future (funding) expectations are dangerous for the 
nation," adding that "it is necessary to indicate a set 
direction" for handling the consumption tax matter. Hata said 
the forum would issue its final decision by Wednesday. 
  Fujii said the stimulus package, to be announced Thursday, 
would be "large-scale," hinting that it will exceed September's 
record 13.2 trillion yen package. He said he hopes it will be 
the last such package needed to get Japan's sluggish economy on 
track for full-fledged recovery in the fiscal year starting in 
April and stable growth in the following fiscal year. 
  Fujii said Japan's economy is not in such dire straits as to 
require a stimulus financed by deficit spending that would erode 
the nation's fiscal position and later prove to be a "disgrace" 
to the financial authorities. Although he does not think the 
economy has hit bottom, he noted that Bank of Japan Governor 
Yasushi Mieno reported signs last week that corporate sentiment 
is improving. 
  Fujii repeated that the same tax reform package that cuts 
taxes must include the "timing and new rate" of the consumption 
tax increase to guarantee repayment of any short-term bonds 
issued to finance the cut. To support his concern about deficit 
spending, he cited a report by the Paris-based Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which he said proves 
the Japanese Government's consolidated fiscal position has 
become "the worst among the leading nations." 
  He said "the world misunderstands" the issue, apparently 
referring to a U.S. Government contention that Japan has fiscal 
breathing room to cut income taxes without linking the move 
directly to a consumption tax hike. 
  Fujii also said he would carefully watch long-term interest 
rates, which have recently begun to edge up, but he played down 
concerns that such upward pressure would put a drag on the 
economy, saying the government will not issue any bonds that 
cannot be "digested" by the market.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Ministers in Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition government made conflicting 
statements Tuesday [1 February] on whether the consumption tax 
should be raised to pay for a proposed income tax cut, 
indicating serious divisions on the issue. 
  Ministers from the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the 
largest 
group in the coalition, opposed such a move, with ministers from 
other parties saying a consumption tax hike and the income tax 
cut are inseparable. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii reiterated his appeal for 
implementing an income tax cut in a package with a consumption 
tax hike. 
  "If two- to three-year deficit-financing bonds are used, it 
would mean discharging (debts) untreated," said Fujii, a member 
of Shinseito, at a press conference. He was referring to 
proposals to issue deficit-covering bonds to pay for the tax cut. 
  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, 
also from Shinseito, voiced opposition to an income tax cut 
without securing a way to pay for it. 
  Kumagai said at a separate press conference that if the 
government decides on "an irresponsible tax cut," public 
confidence in politics would be eroded. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata also indicated that a 
consumption tax hike is needed to finance both an income tax cut 
and an expected tax revenue shortfall. "Given there is a 
revenue shortfall as such, the government cannot avoid 
discussing the issue of how to secure tax revenues," he said. 
  Takenori Kanzaki, minister of posts and telecommunications 
and a member of Komeito, the second-largest party within the 
coalition, also voiced support for a consumption tax hike to 
finance an income tax cut. "There is a need to include a hike 
in the consumption tax rate," Kanzaki said. 
  But cabinet members from the SDP opposed raising the 
consumption tax as a way to finance a major income tax. 
  Transport Minister Shigeru Ito, an SDP member, told a press 
conference that if a consumption tax hike is mentioned in a 
stimulus package to be adopted Thursday, there will be no 
stimulative effect. 
  Sadao Yamahana, minister in charge of political reform, and 
Economic Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota, both 
from the SDP, joined Ito in opposing a consumption tax hike. 
"There are many problems with a hike in the consumption tax 
rate in light of its psychological effects," Yamahana said. 
  Kubota criticized a government tax commission report 
suggesting that an income tax cut be considered together with a 
consumption tax hike. 
  "The Tax Commission is thinking of taxes alone. It's no good 
to think in a vertically divided manner," she said. 
  Government ministers and representatives from the seven 
parties in the coalition government are to meet Wednesday to 
make a decision on whether to include in the package a future 
raise in the 3 percent consumption tax rate to finance a planned 
income tax cut. 
  The proposed income tax cut is expected to become the 
centerpiece of a new pump-priming package Hosokawa's cabinet is 
to finalize Thursday at their meeting.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Ruling coalition parties on 
Tuesday [1 February] remained divided on how to finance a 
proposed income tax cut and postponed a final decision until 
Wednesday, party officials said. Although coalition party 
representatives met twice, they failed to reach a conclusion due 
to a gulf over whether to offset the proposed income tax 
reduction with a hike in the consumption tax, the officials said. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito (the Japan 
Renewal Party), told reporters the meetings broke down, adding 
that the ruling parties will hold another round of talks on 
Wednesday to thrash out a decision. 
  "It all depends on the SDP (Social Democratic Party)," said 
Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the Democratic Socialist 
Party. 
  The SDP, the largest force in the seven-party coalition 
government, has objected to the idea of raising the consumption 
tax, presently at 3 percent, to cover the diminished revenue 
resulting from the proposed income tax cut. 
  The income tax reduction is expected to be the core of a 
fresh economic stimulus package to be finalized by Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet on Thursday. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters later that the 
party is willing to consider a more balanced tax system but 
oppose the consumption tax hike coupled in the same package with 
an income tax reduction. 
  He indicated it is acceptable to issue relatively short-term 
national bonds, like those that mature in five years, to fund 
tax cuts.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party decided Tuesday [1 February] to ask the 
coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to 
implement a 15 trillion yen economic stimulus package, party 
officials said. The officials said the request will be made by 
party leader Yohei Kono at his meeting with Hosokawa on 
Wednesday afternoon. 
  The program, adopted at the party's special panel to combat 
the recession, partly reflects a proposal made by Michio 
Watanabe, a senior member of the party and former foreign 
minister, they said. His 20 trillion yen proposal incorporated 
income and local tax cuts totaling about 10 trillion yen, they 
said. 
  But the LDP will only request an "early implementation of 
sharp tax cuts," they said. The officials said the LDP program 
also calls for a substantial reduction or a freeze of the land 
value tax.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- The government is moving to 
set a one-year deadline for deciding an overall tax policy over 
which the ruling coalition remains split, a senior Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party) official said Tuesday. 
  A compromise plan is gaining ground among the seven-party 
coaltion after coalition party representatives failed to narrow 
the gap over whether to offset the proposed income tax reduction 
with a hike in the consumption tax, the official said. Under 
the plan, the government would issue a statement that would say 
the government should reach within a year a final decision on 
basic tax reform policy including revision of the ratio of 
direct to indirect taxes in the total tax revenues. 
  The plan also calls for the establishment of a special forum 
within the coalition to discuss the problem. 
  The government failed to reach an agreement on the issue due 
mainly to opposition by the Social Democratic Party to raising 
the consumption tax from the current 3 percent to finance the 
planned tax cuts. 
  The forthcoming package of economic stimulus measures will 
include income and resident tax cuts worth over 7 trillion yen, 
the Shinseito official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- The government of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will aim to cut or loosen a total of 
1,450 government regulations starting in the next fiscal year 
beginning in April, government sources said Tuesday [1 February]. 
  The target is contained in the final draft of the cabinet's 
deregulation plan, a copy of which was obtained by KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE. 
  The draft says about 60 laws must be revised to conduct the 
deregulation. Of the 60, the Hosokawa cabinet will submit 50 
amendment bills to the current ordinary session of the Diet, 
which began its 150-day run Monday. 
  The plan will be officially adopted Thursday by the cabinet 
task force on administrative reform promotion, headed by 
Hosokawa, as part of the government's efforts to stimulate the 
sluggish economy, the sources said. 
  The 1,450 items contain 800 regulations to be trimmed and 
650 
rules to be eased. The government will draw up a concrete 
deregulation promotion plan by the end of March 1995, which will 
be carried out over the next five years, according to the plan. 
  The government's proposal on administrative reform has eight 
chapters including deregulation, transferring administrative 
power to local authorities, fostering access to administrative 
information and streamlining administrative procedures. 
  In a related move, an advisory body urged Transport Minister 
Shigeru Ito on Tuesday to ease regulations on pilots' health, 
taking improved medical techniques into consideration. 
  The Transport Ministry hopes to revise related laws by the 
end of June and implement the council's proposals by fall, 
ministry officials said. 
  The panel submitted a report saying that the ministry should 
allow pilots to wear contact lenses instead of glasses. 
Although the ministry does not allow pilots to fly if they put 
on more than 30 percent of the standard weight for their height, 
the council said they should be allowed to fly if their 
circulatory and respiratory systems are functioning healthily. 
  Pilots must pass health checks every half year and other 
crew 
members every year, the ministry said. A total of 13,000 pilots 
and other crew members undergo medical examinations annually and 
an average of about 50 fail, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- The government will take 
measures to aid domestic farmers to be affected by a global 
trade agreement in a supplementary budget for fiscal 1994 and a 
full budget for fiscal 1995, the Farm Minister said Friday [28 
January]. 
  The accord of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks 
came last month under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  However, Eijiro Hata, agriculture, forestry and fisheries 
minister, said such measures will not be included in the primary 
budget for fiscal 1994 which starts April 1. 
  The first meeting of the Agricultural Administration Council 
to discuss drawing up the farm measures will be held on Tuesday, 
Hata told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting. The steps 
will be compiled by the summer, Hata said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Tuesday [1 February] called on a government panel to 
make all- out efforts to create a new vision for restructuring 
Japan's agriculture. 
  The Agricultural Administration Council, an advisory panel 
to 
the prime minister and farm minister, is expected to discuss 
ways to help Japanese farmers, particularly those growing rice, 
to survive in the face of growing international competition. 
  In December last year, Japan agreed to gradually open its 
heavily protected rice market as part of a deal struck in the 
Uruguay Round of global trade talks. 
  The panel is expected to examine the various aspects of the 
nation's agriculture, from the nature of farm areas to product 
prices and distribution systems. It is scheduled to issue a 
mid- term report by the end of July. 
  Hosokawa attended the first day of the panel meeting 
Tuesday, 
along with Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro 
Hata. 
  Hosokawa stressed that the government is set to take all 
possible measures to help Japanese farmers. 
  Hata pledged that his ministry will ensure stable 
production, 
particularly of rice, on the basis of the panel's 
recommendations, and will maintain balanced demand and supply as 
well as prices. 
  Members of the panel said they should examine the Foodstuff 
Control Law, other related laws, and ways to revitalize farm 
areas.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- One-fourth of a group of 
surveyed rice wholesalers and retailers are opposed to the 
selling of domestic rice blended with foreign rice, a KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE survey released Tuesday [1 February] said. KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE recently conducted the survey on 100 rice sellers 
nationwide by picking two to three wholesalers and retailers in 
each of the country's 47 prefectural capitals. 
  Of the respondents, 16 percent replied they have already 
decided to sell domestic and foreign rice separately, while 10 
percent said they have not made a final decision but do not want 
to sell "blended" rice. 
  Another 49 percent answered they have not yet decided 
whether 
they will sell the "blended" rice. 
  Only 22 percent of respondents said they will follow the 
Food 
Agency's policy of selling the foreign rice blended with the 
domestic product. 
  The agency will start test sales of foreign rice this month 
-- 20,000 tons imported from Thailand, 16,000 tons from China 
and 14,000 tons from the United States. 
  An agency official, commenting on the results of the survey, 
said, "The quality of imported rice has been underestimated." 
  The government has decided to import more than one million 
tons of foreign rice to make up for a supply shortfall resulting 
from the country's poor 1993 harvest, the worst in the postwar 
period.

  [Text] Tanegashima, Kagoshima Pref., Feb. 1 KYODO -- 
Japan's state-run space agency said Tuesday [1 February] it will 
launch the first of the country's fully domestically developed 
space rockets, the H-2 series, on Thursday. The National Space 
Development Agency (NASDA) originally scheduled the launch for 
Monday, but postponed it because of bad weather. 
  NASDA officials said the rocket would lift off between 7 AM 
and 9 AM from the Tanegashima Space Center on Tanegashima 
island, off the southernmost main island of Kyushu. 
  The 50-meter, two-stage vehicle is the first space rocket 
developed autonomously with Japanese space technology. It is 
capable of sending a two-ton payload into geostationary orbit. 
  The H-2 rocket will carry a vehicle evaluation payload 
satellite, which will confirm the launch performance of the H-2 
as well as its compatibility with the new range of facilities at 
Tanegashima. 
  It will also carry an experimental vehicle called the 
orbital 
reentry experiment, which is part of a program to prepare a 
Japanese space shuttle called Hope to be launched around 2005.

  [Text] In connection with the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman's statement on the warning of the withdrawal 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a government official 
today issued a commentary revealing that the government expects 
the North Korean side to respond to the government's efforts to 
resolve nuclear issues through dialogue under close cooperation 
with the relevant countries, including the United States. 
  In particular, in connection with the issue concerning 
Patriot missiles which was mentioned in the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman's statement, the government revealed that 
because Patriot missiles are purely defensive weapons, the 
government's review [komto] of deploying Patriot missiles is 
only one of the efforts to improve the ROK-U.S. combined 
defensive posture and thus has nothing do with nuclear issues.

negative [pujongjok] or clearly shows its aim to stall for time, 
the IAEA will stop holding negotiations with North Korea and

  Han also explained that even if North Korea agrees to IAEA 
inspections of its nuclear facilities, the agency will now have 
to undertake much more thorough and additional inspections as 
continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea has already 
broken, KYODO said. 
  Han said he expects some kind of results will emerge from 
the 
IAEA-North Korean negotiations on the inspection within next 
week. Han added that they could be either positive or 
negotiative, KYODO said.

  [Text] Seoul and Washington agreed to deploy Patriot 
missile batteries at U.S. army bases in South Korea in March or 
April, a senior government official said yesterday. 
  He said the U.S. move for early deployment of Patriot 
missiles in South Korea is, in part, aimed at putting pressure 
on North Korea to come to an agreement with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  If the North Korean nuclear problem is solved at an early 
date, the anti-missile missiles could be deployed in Japan 
instead, the official said. 
  He said U.S. President Clinton has not given final approval 
for the deployment of Patriot missiles, but is expected to 
approve it sooner or later. 
  "The South Korean government agrees to the deployment in 
principle and the interceptor missiles will be deployed at the 
bases of U.S. forces here in March or April at the latest," the 
official said. 
  He said the 36 Patriot missiles to be deployed here are for 
protection of strategic points of U.S. forces in South Korea 
rather than for defense of densely populated areas including 
Seoul and the surrounding metropolitan area. 
  Deployment of Patriots on the Korean Peninsula is the first 
step in establishing the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, 
which the U.S. government is pushing for on a long-term basis. 
  Washington confirmed Wednesday it was considering deployment 
of Patriot missiles in South Korea to defend its ally against 
North Korean attack. 
  Gen. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. forces in Korea, requested 
deployment of Patriot missiles late last year to prepare against 
Scud missile attacks by North Korea.

  [Text] The government believes that the United States will 
demand a drastic increase in our side's share of defense 
expenses when it deploys Patriot missiles in our country. Thus, 
our government is studying measures for this. 
  On 31 January, a relevant government official said that 
"during the 1991 ROK-U.S. annual security consultative 
conference, the ROK promised the United States that it would 
take up an additional $10 million in defense expenses when 
facilities are expanded in the event of Patriot missiles 
deployment in the ROK." He added that "this amount, however, 
was calculated on the condition that the missiles will be 
deployed on a base in Osan that is already being used by U.S. 
Forces in the ROK. Therefore, if the United States wants to use 
another base, it is likely that the United States will demand 
that the ROK be responsible for a considerable amount of 
additional expenses." 
  The official noted that "it is not clear at this point 
whether the United States will use the Osan base when it deploys 
the missiles or not. However, there is a great possibility that 
the United States will request a new base or a base in another 
area to deploy the missiles." 
  The official said that "in that case, the afore-mentioned 
agreement would be nullified. Therefore, the United States will 
demand a drasticallly increased amount of defense burdensharing 
by the ROK in the name of securing facilities and the like."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- Seoul and Washington are 
reportedly out of step over the timing of deploying U.S. Patriot 
missiles in South Korea, with the Americans wanting to execute 
the plan as soon as possible while the Koreans are in no hurry. 
The two governments, currently discussing deployment of Patriot 
missiles on the Korean peninsula, are considering some time in 
March or April, a senior Seoul official said Tuesday. 
  Korea is in no hurry to deploy the missiles as there are no 
clear signs of a threat to the Korean peninsula, while the 
United States wants deployment to take place as soon as 
possible, producing the difference of opinion, the official said. 
  Seoul, fearing that the missile deployment may provoke 
Pyongyang and sidetrack the process of resolving the North 
Korean nuclear problem, wants to watch the progress of the 
nuclear talks before making a decision, he said.

carriers would be deployed in the vicinity of the Korean 
peninsula, an ROK Government official said today that the ROK 
Government has not been informed of such deployment. He also 
said he knew this is not true. This official also said that 
when the Team Spirit exercise is conducted, U.S. forces aircraft 
carriers are normally deployed near the Korean peninsula. He 
added: No decision has been made on whether to conduct the Team 
Spirit exercise this year. Therefore, no decision has been made 
to deploy aircraft carriers near the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Assistant Finance Minister Yim says Seoul wants the 
United States to unify dialogue channels on financial issues. 
He added that it is the United States that led to a stalemate 
in the Uruguay Round financial services negotiations. Yim said 
Washington threatened to take the exemption from the most 
favored nation (MFN) status, an act which is a violation of a 
universal principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. "The United States declared in the Uruguay Round 
negotiations that it will adopt a two-tier approach to deny MFN 
status to countries that Washington argues reject full national 
treatment and market access to U.S. financial services 
companies," Yim said. 
  If the United States had stuck to the MFN principle, the 
multilateral financial services agreement would have been 
reached in Geneva last December, Yim said. 
  In an apparent displeasure over the US trade 
representative's 
[USTR] comment on Korea and Japan as "free riders" in financial 
services, Yim said the purpose of the USTR is to open foreign 
markets. Kantor made a special reference to Korea and Japan as 
free riders out of attempt to maximize "announcement effect" in 
prodding these countries into opening further their financial 
markets. 
  He said it is regrettable for the USTR to complain over the 
Korean financial market while the U.S. Treasury Department does 
not make any comment. 
  Korea is one of a few countries where a large number of U.S. 
financial firms are operating. As the Korean and Japanese 
markets are attractive, the USTR seeks to open their financial 
markets wider, he said. 
  Yim said the USTR is not interested in African countries 
where few or no American firms are operating. 
  Why does the United States complain that Korea is unwilling 
to open its financial market at a time when the nation has been 
accelerating the implementation of the financial reform plan? 
Yim said it is because American firms can find "attractive 
business opportunities" here. 
  Yim acknowledged that Seoul has not accommodated part of the 
U.S. requests because some of its proposals are "out of tune 
with international practices." 
  For example, the United States wants American bank branches 
here to use head office capital as their branch capital. But 
even Germany and France do not accept this request. "As Korea 
has no power to inspect head offices of foreign banks here, it 
can not check the credit worthiness of each bank. Thus it is 
unreasonable for American banks to try to link their head office 
capital to Korean operations," he said. 
  Asked to comment on what action Seoul will take if 
Washington 
takes a retaliatory step against Korea, Yim said "it is the last 
thing we want". But "we do not want a situation where the 
United States retains the right to restrict operations of Korean 
firms in the United States while American financial firms are 
expanding business here." 
  In the Uruguay Round, "We made it clear that if any country 
restricts the overseas activities of Korean financial firms, we 
will take a similar reciprocal retaliatory action against the 
financial firms from the specific country, Yim said. [no end 
quotation mark as published] 
  If Washington seeks to take an exemption from the MFN 
standing to discriminate against specific countries, other GATT 
member countries will take similar actions, adding that the 
United States will face international criticism for violating 
the basic principle of the GATT, Yim said.

<F P=106> [Text] Ordinary Koreans are perplexed not only by Finance </F>
Minister Hong Chae-hyong's speedy implementation of financial 
reform but also by the continued U.S. complaints about the 
domestic market opening. 
  Is Minister Hong lying or is the United States seeking an 
"overblown" political and strategic reaction to squeeze more 
concessions from Korea? 
  U.S. government officials, including U.S. Trade 
Representative chief Mickey Kantor, picked Korea and Japan as 
their "main problem countries" in their market opening regarding 
for American financial service firms. 
  Finance Minister Hong said he wants to make Seoul a leading 
financial center in Northeast Asia. And few Korean bankers 
doubt the government has been implementing its financial reform 
plan at a full speed. 
  Many American bankers, including James D. Vaughn, manager of 
the Seoul branch of American Express Bank, did not hesitate in 
praising Seoul's recent financial reforms but U.S. government 
officials are reluctant to appreciate what's happening in the 
Korean financial market. 
  A few divisions of the MOF [Ministry of Finance] appear to 
be 
waging a competition these days to rewrite insurance, foreign 
exchange, and foreign direct investment laws. They are 
liberalizing foreign exchange and capital flows and eliminating 
preferential policy loans. They deregulated the bulk of 
interest rates, and announced a series of reform measures. 
  Why does the United States have such a complaint? Is it 
justifiable? 
  Many analysts here believe that the U.S. Treasury Department 
and the U.S. Trade Representative are waging their own 
competition to gain the upper hand in their push to open the 
"lucrative" financial market in Korea. Sandwiched between the 
bureaucratic infighting, Korea faces double pressure, they said. 
  Seoul's financial market is being liberalized at a rapid 
pace 
by Korean standards but at a snail's pace by U.S. norms, a 
Western diplomat said. 
  Kantor said the United States wants Korea to open its market 
in a way that the United States and the European Union open 
theirs. 
  Choe Chang-pong, an economist at the Korea Tax Institute, 
said "The United States will not be satisfied until Korea has an 
open financial system the same as the United States has." But he 
said if Korea further speeds up its liberalization, local 
institutions may have a tough time in keeping up with it." 
[quotation marks as published] 
  Washington is hell-bent on prying open Korea's financial 
market because American financial services firms can do good 
business here. The United States appears to expect Seoul to open 
its financial market wider following Korea's concession to open 
its rice market, analysts said. 
  Although Seoul unveiled its five-year financial reform plan 
last year, it refused to link it to the Uruguay Round. This 
raised U.S. suspicions that Korea might change its mind on 
reform in the future, they said. 
  Washington believes that without constant pressure, Korea 
might backpedal on its liberalization, analysts here said. 
  The U.S. threat to retaliate has discouraged Korean 
policymakers who have worked overtime to implement financial 
reform plans, an MOF official said. 
  One Seoul professor said, "If the U.S. repeats its threat of 
retaliation without praising Seoul's achievements, MOF officials 
may not voluntarily deregulate financial rules." Instead, they 
will hide major issues of great interest to American firms until 
the United States puts pressure on Korea. 
  They will hide "big gifts" (concessions) until U.S. 
officials 
visit Korea, he added. 
  He and Korean economists said that the U.S. will invite 
undue 
anti-Americanism from the Korean people when they use such 
"hackneyed" words as threat or retaliation at a time when the 
nation is moving toward fuller financial reform. 
<H5>  U.S. Pressure </H5>
  MOF officials are angered when U.S. officials threaten to 
twist their arms to open the market further at a time when many 
American bankers and businessmen are praising MOF officials for 
their reform of the domestic financial system. They question 
who is pushing the U.S. government to put pressure on Korea to 
open its market wider. MOF officials suspect that a few 
American bankers, who have seen their profits fall here, are 
complaining that it is because of the "worsening business 
environment." 
  The worsening environment is due to the intensifying 
competition following deregulation, not because of Seoul's 
discriminatory practices against foreign financiers, MOF 
officials said. 
  Many bankers, including Hana Bank's Yun Pyong-chol, said the 
more Korea opens its market, the more difficulty foreign banks 
will face in expanding revenue. 
  MOF officials speculate such complaints originate from a few 
foreign bankers' attempt to hide their mismanagement or lack of 
talent. 
<H5>  Arm-Twisting </H5>
  The U.S. Treasury expects Congress to enact the "Fair Trade 
in Financial Services Act." For the first time, the U.S. 
administration has taken a unified position in supporting this 
legislation, which will be used to retaliate against foreign 
countries. But analysts here said there are still problems, 
however, in winning passage, particularly in the House of 
Representatives. 
  Despite high-pitched rhetoric, the United States will not be 
able to retaliate against Korea at least until the end of 1995. 
An MOF official said, "We are worried over how successfully we 
implement our reform plan, not U.S. retaliatory threats." 
  For the next two years, Washington will seek intensify 
pressure on Korea and other Asian countries to open their 
financial markets. But MOF officials say over the next two 
years, Korea will implement the bulk of its five-year financial 
reform program and hope U.S. complaints die down.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 29 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. Government has 
decided to shelve temporarily the application for permanent 
residence in the United States filed by Kim Chong-hwi, former 
South Korean President No Tae-u's senior secretary for Foreign 
Affairs and National Security, in consideration of the Korean 
Government's opposition to the application, a Foreign Ministry 
official said over the weekend. 
  Chang Chae-yong, the Ministry's North America bureau chief, 
said his Ministry had just received from the U.S. State 
Department a letter officially confirming Kim's permanent 
residenceship application. 
  The U.S. Government said the immigration and naturalization 
office would make the final decision on Kim's application 
because it falls under the office's responsibility. 
  It is hard at the moment to tell when the office will start 
examining Kim's application and when it will finish the 
examination. 
  Kim's application was for permanent residenceship, and not 
for political asylum, Chang quoted a U.S. Government official, 
who handed the State Department's letter to the Ministry, as 
saying. 
  The U.S. Government promised a maximum cooperation in 
dealing 
with Kim's permanent residenceship application, stressing the 
issue is not a matter of political consideration, Chang said. 
  Asked about Washington's decision to shelve Kim's 
application, Chang said the U.S. Government is not in a hurry to 
take action on this matter. 
  The government has earlier asked the U.S. Government not to 
permit Kim's permanent residence on the ground that he is wanted 
in Korea in connection with the irregularities related to the 
military modernization program.

  [Text] YONHAP--It has been learned that the U.S. Government 
is considering to forcibly deport Kim Chong-hwi, former 
Chongwadae [presidential offices] presidential senior secretary 
for foreign affairs and national security, whose application for 
permanent U.S. residency has recently become a diplomatic issue 
between the ROK and the United States. 
  A high-ranking government official said on 28 January 
"regarding our government's 26 January official request against 
Kim's application for U.S. visa extension and permanent 
residency, the U.S. side informed us of its intention to shelve 
his visa extension." 
  The official added: "I know Kim's visa holds good for one 
year and it would expire in April. The U.S. Government is 
considering the question of shelving his visa extension and 
deporting him from the United States." 
  This official, however, expressed his concern by saying: 
"What is annoying is that there is legally no way for our 
government to bring him home, even if the United States did 
expel him, unless he returns voluntarily. There is a 
possibility that the matter becomes complicated, if Kim chooses 
to go to a third country." 
  The official predicted that "it is hard to expect an 
immediate settlement of the Kim issue, because if the United 
States shelves his visa extension, Kim would be able to stay in 
the United States for at least a period of time if he decided to 
retain a lawyer to legally fight the case."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- Kim Chong-hwi, the former 
presidential aide who has bolted the country to avoid 
prosecution on charges of accepting bribes, was preparing to 
settle down with his family in the United States last December 
when he invited his son and daughter-in-law to live there, it 
was disclosed Tuesday. 
  Meanwhile, former President No Tae-u, aware of mounting 
public criticism against his former secretary for foreign and 
national security affairs, is trying to contact Kim to persuade 
him not to seek permanent residency in the United States, 
sources said. 
  No, who had been indifferent to the issue until recently, 
was 
unsuccessful in his attempt to get in touch with Kim in the 
United States, they said. 
  Kim left the country shortly after he was implicated in an 
investigation of alleged irregularities in the Yulgok project, 
and was reported in recent weeks to have applied for permanent 
U.S. residency or even political asylum. 
  One aide to No said Tuesday he fears that the former 
president may ultimately have to take responsibility if Kim 
fails to return to Korea. That's why "we have been asking 
around if people know the whereabouts of Kim, but so far they 
are not known," he added. 
  It was disclosed belatedly that Kim's 27-year-old son and 
his 
wife suddenly left the country for the United States at the end 
of last December and speculation abounds here now that Kim had 
already made careful preparations to settle down in the United 
States for good.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Ambassador to South 
Korea James T. Laney said on Tuesday that North Korea should 
ease tensions by opening up its nuclear program. Laney, in a 
speech prepared for delivery at a dinner meeting hosted by the 
Korean-American Association Tuesday afternoon, said North Korea 
also "should begin to open its economy, and move as quickly as 
possible to grant its people those civil and human rights which 
are, after all, the reason governments are instituted among men." 
  At the meeting held in the Hyatt Hotel in downtown Seoul, he 
said, "I have a personal image of the contrast between the world 
built by communist societies and that we enjoy in the free 
world... North Korea is on the sad side of this contrast. They 
must come to terms with this fact." 
  He added that South Korea has to come to terms with its own 
new self. 
  "I want to urge you to embrace the status you've earned as 
one of the world's leaders... So when I urge you to accept and 
believe in the Korea that you've built, I'm hoping that your 
acceptance will lead you to embrace the responsibilities of a 
world leader," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 29 (YONHAP) -- The government has 
decided to collect rents for U.S. Embassy buildings here in 
Seoul retroactively to the past five years and in the future and 
inform shortly the U.S. Government of the decision, a Foreign 
Ministry official said over the weekend. He added the 
government would start negotiations with the U.S. Government on 
the matter during next week, if things go smoothly. 
  The Board of Audit and Inspection noted last July that the 
U.S. Government had not paid rents for its embassy buildings for 
the past 13 years without any legal basis. 
  The government has concluded that it is reasonable to 
collect 
retroactive rents for the past five years and continue to 
collect new rents in the future, the official said. 
  The government will also request that the U.S. Government 
move the embassy to the old site of Kyonggi Girls High School as 
soon as possible, he added. The rents are estimated at about 
500 million won a year. The U.S. Government is expected to 
claim the right to use the buildings free of rents.

  [Text] Rev. Billy Graham of the United States left Beijing 
for Pyongyang on Thursday carrying with him a verbal message 
from U.S. President Bill Clinton to Kim Il-song, a government 
source said. 
  "We understand Clinton's message calls on North Korea to 
resolve the nuclear question at an early date," he said. 
  The source added that Rev. Graham will drop into Hong Kong 
after his visit to North Korea, where he will have a press 
conference on the results of his visit to Pyongyang. 
  During his stay in Pyongyang, Graham is expected to meet 
President Kim Il-song and officiate service at the Pongsu church

  This is Graham's second visit to North Korea. During his 
first visit in April 1992, he conferred with Kim Il-song and 
gave a lecture at Kim Il-song University.

<F P=106> [Article by Chong In-hwa in the "North Korean Newsletter" </F>
column: "Christianity in North Korea Is a Bait for Inducing 
Western Capital"] 
  [Excerpts] World-renowned evangelist Rev. Billy Graham is 
now visiting North Korea. As a result, Christianity in North 
Korea is now the focus of attention. 
  Rev. Billy Graham previously visited North Korea in 1992. 
This is his second visit. North Korean radio has reported that 
during his meeting with North Korean President Kim Il-song Rev. 
Billy Graham conveyed a verbal message from U.S. President 
Clinton. Rev. Graham reportedly will hold revival services at 
Pongsu Church or Chilkol Church (formerly Pansok Church). 
  North Korea invited Billy Graham to North Korea in order to 
induce money from Christian circles for the development of the 
Najin-Sonbong district and discuss the construction of a large 
church in the area. [passage omitted on the state of 
Christianity in North Korea] 
  Experts say that just like Billy Graham's visit, Christians' 
visits to North Korea -- which North Korea facilitates to 
improve relations between North Korea and the United States, 
overcome its economic difficulties, and induce Western capital 
-- will continue.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Chondogyo, an 
indigenous religion, sent a telephone message on Tuesday to its 
North Korean counterpart with a counterproposal that they meet 
in March after observing progress on the North Korean nuclear 
problem. 
  O Ik-chae, supreme leader of South Korean Chondogyo, 
proposed 
in his message that they hold a working-level contact in the 
Truce Village of Panmunjom in March to discuss ways to jointly 
push ahead with a project celebrating the 100th anniversary of 
the Tonghak Revolution. 
  The message to Yu Mi-yong, chairman of the central guidance 
committee of North Korean Chondogyo, was in reply to a North 
Korean proposal on Jan. 24 that they hold a working-level 
contact in Panmunjom on Feb. 3 to discuss the joint 
commemoration. 
  O said, "in the current situation, a visit by your people to 
Seoul is not appropriate. I firmly believe that every problem 
will be solved by early March and that we must make efforts to 
solve the problems by then." 
  Chondogyo is a religion founded in Korea by Choe Che-u in 
1859. It is the religion of the heavenly way (Chondo), but its 
name was later changed to Tonghak (eastern learning). 
  In an era of political chaos in the late 19th century, the 
followers of Tonghak rejected the influence of Japan, Russia, 
China and other foreign powers and rebelled against the king and 
the government. However, they failed to take power.

  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam said yesterday that his 
administration will actively promote economic cooperation with 
North Korea upon the settlement of the nuclear issue. 
  "Once the nuclear problem is settled, we will have serious 
discussions about bilateral economic cooperation programs," Kim 
said in an interview with the SEGYE TIMES marking the fifth 
anniversary of the paper's founding. 
  The President said the two sides may jointly participate in 
economic projects as part of bilateral cooperation. 
  "The administration also plans to allow South Korean 
businessmen to visit North Korea and participate in development 
projects in the Najin and Sonbong areas in the North," he said. 
  On the domestic political front, President Kim said 
individual ability will be the most important yardstick in 
nominating the ruling party's candidates for the 1995 local 
elections and the 1996 parliamentary elections. 
  "The scheduled implementation of full-fledged local autonomy 
(next year) and the need for winning a national competitive edge 
require legislators to play a new role," he said. 
  The President, who also heads the ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party (DLP), said that his party will nominate as candidates for 
next year's gubernatorial and mayoral elections those who can 
deal with the changes in the role and functions of local 
governments in the age of local autonomy and 
internationalization. Kim said that foreign language education 
is important in raising the nation's internationalization 
standard.

<F P=106> [Interview with Private First Class Kim Chol-chin and </F>
Private Kim Kyong-chol of North Korea's People's Security Forces 
by unidentified reporters at the Metropolitan Armed Forces 
Hospital in Seoul on 29 January] 
  [Text] [SEOUL SINMUN] How is your health? 
  [North Korean soldier] We are fine. We became 
unconscious because we did not drink a single drop of water for 
two days. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] How did you, soldiers, catch fish aboard a 
rowboat and were you adrift? 
  [North Korean soldier] We caught fish with nets used 
during off-duty hours by platoon soldiers serving in our 
guardpost. The weather was good as we were leaving on 25 
January, however, sudden heavy seas prevented us from rowing the 
boat. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] What do you know about South Korea? What do 
North Korean newspapers and broadcasting stations inform you 
about South Korea? 
  [North Korean soldier] South Korea is a society in which 
there are rich people and poor people. North Korea is 
different. It is hard to say, but we know South Korea is not a 
good society in many respects. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] Do you want to see South Korean society? 
  [North Korean soldier] Definitely not. All we want is to 
return home. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] You may be punished when you return home. 
Are you afraid? 
  [North Korean soldier] We will return even if we may be 
punished. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] Why did you completely shave your heads? 
  [North Korean soldier] All soldiers shaved their heads 
last October under an order from the leadership. We know such 
an order was issued because shaven heads are good for combat, 
personal hygiene, and medical treatment. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] Did you feel people you have met here are 
your compatriots? 
  [North Korean soldier] Yes. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] Will reunification be achieved? 
  [North Korean soldier] Reunification will be achieved 
next year. It is definite because the father [oboi] Kim 
Chong-il said so. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] How was the food at the hospital? 
  [North Korean soldier] I serve at an isolated place to 
which there is no train service. The reason the food here is so 
good must be because this is the central hospital. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] How is your life in the North Korean Army? 
  [North Korean soldier] We must serve in the Army for 10 
years. I have not visited my home since I joined the Army. [end 
soldier] 
  Kim Chol-chin has served in the Army for seven years, and 
Kim 
Kyong-chol, for four years.

27 January. These two North Korean solders were repatriated to 
North Korea through Panmunjom at 1500 [0600 GMT] on 1 February. 
The two North Korean soldiers are Private First Class Kim 
Chol-chin and Private Kim Kyong-chol of North Korea's People's

military hospital. The issue of their repatriation was carried 
out from a humanitarian point of view, following their desire to 
return to the North. 
  The National Defense Ministry had discussed this matter with 
the North Korean side through the Military Armistice Commission 
on 29 January. This is the first instance of repatriation of 
North Korean soldiers who are on active duty.

<F P=106> [Article by Yi Sang-ki: "No Sign of North Korea's </F>
Provocation Against the South"] 
  [Text] With repeated reports by the U.S. press on the U.S. 
Government plan to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache offensive 
helicopters on the Korean peninsula and on the state 
intelligence support team dispatched to the ROK, people are 
under the impression that tensions are being heightened on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  In the annual report to President Kim Yong-sam on 20 
January, 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reported: North Korea internally 
completed war preparations last year. As North Korea has 
designated 1995 as the year of reunification, it is making every 
effort to achieve this end. Therefore, in the event that the 
nuclear issue--its meaningful card--faces a deadlock and that 
North Korea comes to a crisis in its political system, there is 
a great possibility that North Korea will attempt armed 
provocations in order to overcome the crisis. 
  It is indeed a matter of interest if the moves of the North 
Korean Army are so alarming that the situation on the Korean 
peninsula can be described as a crisis, as reflected in the 
intensified armament by U.S. Forces in the ROK and by Defense 
Minister Yi in his report, even indirectly. 
  Meanwhile, North Korea on 28 January denounced the plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK, stating that "the reckless 
attempt of South Korea and the United States to bring North 
Korea under their military control has passed beyond the 
dangerous level" and that this plan is "a grave intolerable 
military challenge." 
  In fact, many experts on North Korean affairs observe that 
as 
long as North Korea is under international pressure -- including 
that of the United States -- concerning the nuclear issue, there 
is nearly no possibility that North Korea will commit 
provocations or start a war against the South unless there is a 
specific change in the situation. This is because North Korea is 
well aware that such a provocative act will give a justification 
to the United States for a military attack and thus North Korea 
will suffer military retaliation, like Iraq. 
  The Defense Ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] also 
revealed that "preparations are always indispensable for one to 
commit a provocation. However, military activities of the North 
Korean Army regarding provocation against the South have not 
been detected." 
  Nevertheless, military experts view that although there is 
no 
direct sign of provocation in view of recent movements of the 
North Korean Army, North Korea is consistently maintaining the 
policy of reinforcing its military power to safeguard its 
internal system and to enhance the authority of Supreme 
Commander Kim Chong-il as the military leader. 
  The North Korean Army has been constantly reinforcing its 
fire power, including deployment of 170-mm self-propelled guns 
and 240-mm multiple rocket launchers, in frontline areas south 
of Pyongyang and Wonsan, including the Armistice Line. In 
addition, it is continually building missile bases, air fields, 
and military industry plants, as well as supplementary 
underground facilities. 
  In other words, 65 percent of ground forces, 60 percent of 
military vessels and ships, and 40 percent of fighters have been 
deployed in the advanced areas. Relevant military officials said 
that, in particular, ground forces are actively conducting field 
tactical exercises for division-level units and general tactical 
training for special troops during the winter training period. 
The JCS also noted that training activities, which have been 
decreasing since 1989, have recently been restored completely. 
  Besides, 16 battle squadrons were organized under the 
command of the East and West Sea Fleets. Thus, the North Korean 
Navy now has a total of 770 ships and vessels, including 26 
submarines, 460 combat ships, and 310 landing ships and rubber 
rafts. However, its exercise is inactive facing a winter 
maintenance season. 
  On the other hand, the North Korean Air Force, composed of 
three combat air force commands, has 850 tactical aircraft 
including 60 ultramodern MiG-23 and MiG-24, and 480 supporting 
aircraft including AN-2 [as published]. The number of aircraft 
totals up to 1,620. By taking advantage of fine weather 
conditions, the North Korean Air Force is actively conducting 
exercises, and by mobilizing quasi-military units, it is also 
actively staging mobilization training during the farmers' slack 
season. 
  Military experts pointed out that the North Korean 
authorities constantly reinforced conventional weapons and 
conducted military exercises this year in a bid to increase 
their military power, and that they will direct great efforts to 
the development of mass lethal weapons, including biochemical 
weapons and missiles, according to their political purpose. 
  The relevant military officials said: Although no sign of 
direct and concrete provocations by North Korea has been 
detected up to now, in the event that economic sanctions and 
limited military sanctions are visible against North Korea after 
nuclear negotiation is ruptured and that North Korea faces a 
crisis in its system with internal discord to be erupted in the 
course of establishing Kim Chong-il's hereditary system, the 
danger of war on the Korean peninsula will certainly be 
heightened.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Ambassador to China said on Tuesday that relations between North 
Korea and China, which had deteriorated shortly after the 
establishment of diplomatic ties between South Korea and China, 
seem to have recovered. 
  Hwang Pyong-tae, here to attend the annual conference of 
Korean ambassadors and envoys, said at a bull session with 
journalists that the recent visit to Beijing by Hwang Chang-yop, 
secretary of the North Korean Workers' Party, had helped to 
improve the two nations' relations. 
  North Korea had criticized China for being "revisionist" and 
even "a traitor" since Seoul formed diplomatic ties with Beijing 
in August 1992. 
  "North Korea recently sent many people to the Chinese cities 
of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen to make them learn 
directly the Chinese way of reform and opening. North Korea 
seems to be changing now," he said. 
  Meanwhile, China's position on the North Korean nuclear 
issue 
is that if South Korea and the United States keep talking with 
North Korea, the problem will be solved, he said. 
  "Especially, China thinks that North Korea will push ahead 
with policies of reform and opening once its nuclear problem is 
solved." 
  Acknowledging the seriousness of the nuclear problem, 
Beijing 
is trying to persuade Pyongyang to settle the matter before Feb. 
21, when the Board of Governors' meeting of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is scheduled, he added. 
  On reports of a possible visit by Kim Il-song to Beijing, he 
said, "North Korean President Kim Il-song, who had visited China 
as many as 39 times, has not visited Beijing since 1992. I 
think it's about time for him to visit there, as relations 
between Pyongyang and Beijing have recovered." 
  Meanwhile, he expected that before President Kim Yong-sam's 
visit to China in late March, Seoul and Beijing will be able to 
conclude aviation, cultural cooperation, and double taxation 
avoidance agreements.

<F P=106> [Report by Hong Kong-based correspondent Kim Song-yong] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that North Korea recently sent 
a large-scale survey team to the Shenzhen and Zuhai special 
economic zones in Guangdong Province to conduct an intensive 
study of Chinese reform and openness. The North Korean move 
seems to be in preparation for the partial opening it is 
reported to be considering for the first half of this year, 
North Korean sources in Hong Kong said on 30 January. 
  According to the sources, North Korea on 20 December 
dispatched to Shenzhen--China's first special economic zone--a 
survey team consisting of some 20 members of section chief-level 
officials from major organizations such as the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade, the External Economic Committee, and the Academy 
of Sciences. Since then, the survey team has been conducting a 
survey on the background of the establishment of the special 
economic zone, layout of land, the way of controlling residents 
between the special economic zone and the ordinary areas, the 
foreign capital introduction policy and laws and regulations 
thereof, and the activities of the trading firms in the special 
economic zone. It has been learned that the survey team has 
been keeping its government in Pyongyang informed of its 
findings through the North Korean trade missions in Guangzhou, 
Beijing, and Shenyang. North Korea increased the personnel of 
its trade mission in Guangzhou by five persons last August, and 
this is taken to have a bearing on its survey of the special 
economic zone. 
  Since last December, North Korea has also been dispatching a 
number of senior officials from the Light Industry Ministry, the 
External Economic Committee, the Nungna Trade General Bureau, 
and the Unha Trade General Corporation to the southern district 
of China, including Zuhai. 
  The North Korean survey team, which is expected to stay in 
China until February, thinks the Shenzhen model is suitable for 
North Korea in that Shenzhen is independently managed in the 
manner of being cut off from other areas, therefore, North Korea 
is very likely to apply the Shenzhen model to the prospective 
North Korean areas for the introduction of openness, such as the 
Najin-Sonbong area, Chongjin, Haeju, Nampo, and Sinuiju, the 
sources said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- North Korea's Communist 
Party (Workers' Party) is sending numerous delegations abroad to 
expand relations with foreign socialist parties this year, 
NAEWOE PRESS reported on Tuesday. 
  According to NAEWOE, Seoul's official North Korea watcher, a 
delegation headed by party Secretary Hwang Chang-yop visited 
China from Jan. 15-22 and met with President Jiang Zemin and 
other senior officials. 
  Three other delegations visited Italy, France, Malaysia, 
Indonesia and Uganda and exchanged views on issues of mutual 
interest with socialist parties in January. 
  A delegation led by Vice Director Pak Kyong-son attended the 
national congresses of the Italian Communist Party and the 
French Communist Party. The North Koreans met with communist 
party delegations from India, Turkey and Germany at the French 
Communist Party Congress on Jan. 26-27 and discussed ways of 
improving ties and strengthening solidarity to sustain socialist 
prinicples. 
  Another delegation, led by Vice Director Kim Yang-kon, met 
with leaders of the Malaysian Unification Party on Jan. 27. 
  North Korean broadcasts claimed the foreign parties praised 
the contributions of North Korean President Kim Il-song and his 
heir apparent Kim Chong-il to the international communist 
movement and expressed full support for North Korea's 
unification policy, NAEWOE reported.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 31 (YONHAP) -- The government on Monday 
decided to fully liberalize travels to China by South Koreans in 
the foreseeable future. The decision was made at a meeting of 
working-level officials from relevant government offices. It 
was presided over by Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong. 
  The meeting did not set the time of China trip 
liberalization, but an informed source said the time would 
possibly be two months later, the end of March. 
  "At the meeting, attendees agreed to liberalize South 
Koreans' travels to China at the soonest early date and left the 
determining of the time to the Foreign Ministry," an official 
said. He added that to facilitate free trips to China, there 
should first be some security precautionary measures such as 
steps to keep people from illegally entering North Korea by way 
of China. 
  "Given the time needed to prepare such steps, we believe 
travels to China could be liberalized toward the end of March," 
he said. 
  Presently, a person wishing to visit China, Cuba, Laos or 
Cambodia should obtain an invitation from an organization or 
firm of the country he likes to visit and then obtain a 
government permit to go.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 31 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China 
will sign an agreement on cultural exchanges in March, a 
government official said here on Monday. 
  "Seoul and Beijing have agreed to sign the agreement on 
cultural exchanges and are now negotiating details of the 
agreement. The agreement is to be initialed in February and is 
likely to be signed officially in March," the official said. 
  "China sent a draft agreement to Seoul and we delivered our 
reply, and recently China returned its revised draft. The 
drafts of both countries are nearly similar, so the agreement 
will be initialed by the end of February," he said. 
  It usually takes a month from initialing an agreement to its 
formal signing, so Seoul and Beijing are expected to sign the 
accord formally in March. 
  "The agreement refers to cooperation in many areas like 
culture, art, academics, education and sports and it will serve 
as momentum to boost cultural exchanges between Korea and China, 
which have shared close cultural exchanges over thousands of 
years," the official said. 
  The agreement stipulates that the two countries set up a 
Korea-China cultural joint committee, which will deal with 
details on cultural exchanges. 
  "Once the agreement is signed, the two nations will 
undertake 
joint projects such as restoration of old buildings in China," 
the official said. 
  Before the Seventh Century, Koreans controlled a great deal 
of Northeastern China, so many Korean cultural assets exist in 
the region.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 31 (YONHAP) -- While tentatively 
agreeing to open regular direct air services between their two 
capitals South Korea and China have decided not to grant one 
another beyond-point traffic rights that permit flights through 
their respective airspace for travel to third-country 
destinations, informed sources here said Monday. 
  Thus when the Seoul-Beijing route opens, which may take 
place 
as early as April, Europe-bound Korean Airlines cannot fly over 
China and Chinese carriers are not permitted to use Korean 
airspace for travel to the United States or Japan, the sources 
said. 
  "We (Seoul and Beijing) did agree on having beyond-point 
traffic rights in principle, but we decided to apply the rights 
in the future when we find them necessary," a Seoul government 
official said. 
  The two governments agreed not to initiate beyond-point 
traffic rights at present because when they do, the 
Seoul-Beijing route could become an international one as it may 
be opened to other airlines and they fear a loss of passengers, 
he said. 
  They reached tentative agreement on opening a direct air 
route between the two capitals after a week of working-level 
talks in Beijing that started Jan. 17. 
  The agreement is expected to be put into writing next month 
in the fifth bilateral aviation talks.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 29 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China 
have agreed to restore the building used by the Korean 
provisional government in Chongqing, China, by Aug. 15 next 
year, a Foreign Ministry official said Saturday. 
  When Japan annexed Korea in 1910 and ruled the country until 
1945, Korean independence fighters set up a government-in-exile 
in Shanghai, China. They later moved it to Chongqing along with 
the Chinese nationalist party, when the Japanese invaded China. 
  "Seoul and Beijing agreed to restore the building of the 
Korean provisional government in Chongqing last December and the 
restoration work will begin in the first half of this year and 
will be completed by Aug. 15 next year," the official said. 
  Aug. 15 is the day when Korea gained independence from Japan 
in 1945 at the end of the World War II. 
  "The area near the site of the Korean provisional government 
in Chongqing is to be demolished for land development, but Seoul 
and Beijing have agreed to restore the building of the Korean 
provisional government. Seoul will invest 1.3 million U.S. 
dollars for it and Beijing will chip in 2 million dollars," he 
said. 
  The premises will include two four-story structures and two 
two-story buildings with an aggregate floor space of 1,712 
square meters.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 29 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
congratulated Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on his 
victory in a parliamentary battle for political reforms in a 
telephone conversation on Saturday evening. Hosokawa said he 
was pleased with the passage at the 11th hour by the Diet 
(parliament) of a political reform bill that has caused two 
governments to fall in the past six years and put his coalition 
cabinet on the brink of collapse. 
  The bill has drawn the world's keen attention for its aim of 
reforming Japan's political system and its failure would damage 
Japan's image in the international community, he added. 
  Kim said he is expecting his visit to Japan in March to 
provide another opportunity for the two countries to increase 
bilateral relations and for "both of us to deepen our 
friendship," as their meetings in Kyongju and Seattle did. 
  Kim then called for close cooperation among South Korea, the 
United States and Japan in the effort to achieve peace in 
Northeast Asia and in the world as well, expressing hope that 
the U.S.-Japan summit slated for next month will be successful.

  [Text] In a meeting with reporters on 31 January, Kong 
No-myong, ROK ambassador to Japan, said: "It is time to hold 
full-scale discussions on ROK-Japanese cultural exchanges based 
on personnel exchanges. Particularly in this Visit Korea Year, 
the government must reexamine its tourist policy to induce 
Japanese tourists, who patronize ROK tourism the most, and 
consider adding Chinese characters to Korean signs." 
  Ambassador Kong, who returned home temporarily to attend the 
overseas mission chiefs meeting to be held here beginning 2 
February, said that our people should abandon their "new policy 
of seclusion" [saeroun swoeguk chongchaek] for 
internationalization and opening up. 
  The following are questions and answers from the meeting 
between Ambassador Kong and reporters: 
  [Unidentified reporter] Some people point out that it is too 
early for the ROK to exchange mass culture [taejung munhwa] with 
Japan in view of the present indiscriminate infiltration of 
Japanese culture. 
  [Kong No-myong] Japanese books, video tapes, and television 
programs from satellite broadcasting services are now virtually 
opened to us. We should publicly introduce high-quality mass 
culture instead of overlooking its unlawful infiltration. An 
agreement on the general opening of mass cultural markets was 
reached in ROK-Japanese summit talks held last year, but the 
details of this issue have yet to be discussed. Accordingly, we 
have to hurry to take active measures. 
  [Reporter] What are the main agenda items to be discussed 
during President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Japan in March? 
  [Kong] There is no pending political issue. Issues on 
economic cooperation between the ROK and Japan, such as mutual 
cooperative relations in preparation for the Uruguay Round 
treaty and methods to vitalize the ROK-Japanese Industrial and 
Technological Cooperation Committee, will be discussed. 
  [Reporter] Will President Kim meet Japanese Emperor Akihito 
when he visits Japan? Will the Japanese emperor visit the ROK? 
  [Kong] As his Japan visit is a state visit, President Kim 
will probably meet the Japanese emperor. If the Japanese 
emperor visits the ROK, it would be a significant event. The 
decision on the date of his ROK visit is a domestic affairs 
matter and must be made prudently. 
  [Reporter] Does the North Korean nuclear issue have any 
relation to the establishment of diplomatic relations between 
Japan and North Korea? 
  [Kong] Japan is willing to resume negotiations with North 
Korea whenever it wants. North Korea, however, has not yet made 
any noteworthy sign. Japan says that the resolution of the 
North Korean nuclear issue is not a prerequisite [chonje chogon] 
for Japanese-North Korean negotiations on establishment of 
diplomatic ties, although the nuclear issue is important.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 29 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
and former Philippine President Corazon Aquino exchanged 
opinions on democracy, reforms and Philippine workers in Korea 
during their meeting at Chongwadae [presidential office] on 
Saturday morning. 
  "I know well that you've contributed much to the 
democratization process in your country," Kim told her, "and I 
gave my spiritual support to your democratization movement at 
the time. I was also in the democratization movement in Korea 
and I know well the difficulties you must have had in that 
movement." 
  Noting that some 15,000 Philippine workers are in Korea now, 
Kim said he had instructed the cabinet to take steps to improve 
working conditions of foreign workers to the level of those for 
domestic workers, including a step for foreign workers to 
benefit from the industrial accident insurance system, 
Chongwadae Spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. 
  "Our trade with China has exceeded the 
10-billion-U.S.-dollar 
mark, though we established diplomatic relations only two years 
ago," Kim said, "but the trade between Korea and the Philippines 
is slow in growth, compared with a long history of relations 
between the two countries." 
  The former Philippine president said she would tell 
President 
Fidel Ramos to take measures for increased trade with South 
Korea and asked for special consideration of Philippine workers, 
as there would be more and more foreign workers in Korea in the 
future. 
  When Kim thanks her for Philippine support in the Korean 
war, 
she said her husband, the late Sen. Aquino, had been a war 
correspondent during the war, and added, "because of this he won 
many votes in elections." 
  Many leaders of the world consider President Kim's political 
reforms as a model for them, she told Kim.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 27 (YONHAP) -- The Parliaments of South 
Korea and the European Union (EU) on Thursday vowed to help 
forge close political and economic relations between Korea and 
the EU. The pledge was contained in a joint statement adopted 
by representatives of the two congresses in their meeting in 
Seoul Thursday afternoon. The statement said that the two sides 
decided to promote bilateral relations through a basic treaty on 
economic cooperation and a joint manifesto for close political 
consultations. The two parliaments decided to establish their 
consultative organization soon after general elections of the EU 
Parliament were held in June this year. 
  The statement also said the two sides would support the 
creation of an experts club to study ways to promote bilateral 
relations and would strive to ensure stepped-up cooperation 
between the EU and APEC (Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation). 
  The meeting was attended by about 20 parliamentary delegates 
from the two sides. South Korean legislators were led by Yi 
Han-tong of the Democratic Liberal Party and the head of the EU 
delegation was G. Rinsche.

  [Text] Agricultural &amp; Fishery Marketing Corp. yesterday 
agreed with the Australian state of New South Wales to promote 
bilateral cooperation on trade of agricultural and fishery 
products between Korea and Australia, a corporation spokesman 
said. 
  For this, Sin Tae-chin, the corporation's president, signed 
a 
contract with Ian Causley, agriculture minister of the 
Australian state, to establish a collaboration body between food 
institutions of the two sides, he said. 
  Last year, meanwhile, the state-run corporation's exports of 
agricultural, livestock, forestry and fishery products rose 
sharply 124 percent to $305 million from a year earlier, 
according to the spokesman. 
  By field, shipments of agricultural and livestock products 
soared 148 percent to $101 million in 1993 from the year before, 
while exports of fishery products skyrocketed 212 percent to $92 
million, he said.

Fishery Marketing Corp. (AFMC) signed export contracts for 
Korean farm products worth 2.57 million U.S. dollars at the 
Berlin International Farm Products Fair, which ended Jan. 23, 
an AFMC spokesman said Friday. 
  Fifteen Korean companies displayed 54 items at the fair, 
with 
the most popular being sweet rice drink, pumpkin soup, kimchi, 
odorless garlic and chicken soup with ginseng. Ginseng 
products, a main export item, were not displayed at the fair so 
the contracts were poor. AFMC will attend nine international 
farm products fairs this year, including the Berlin Fair, to 
make Korean products better known to the world.

  Meanwhile, the ministry will issue daily reports on 
international situation with assistance of the Institute of 
Foreign Affairs and National Security and will distribute them 
to related ministries.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam has 
registered his family's assets at 2.08 billion won (2.5 million 
U.S. dollars) this year, up 440.59 million won from last summer 
due mainly to the growth of his father's fishing business. 
Under the public servants' ethics law, government officials 
above the grade one level who are obliged to disclose assets had 
to report any change in their financial standing since 
registration last Aug. 12 by Monday. 
  Kim himself is worth 575 million won, up 15.21 million won 
from 560.29 million won last August, due to the accumulation of 
monthly savings of 3 million won. 
  His other assets include a 410-million-won house in 
Sangdo-tong, Seoul, and 150 million won worth of farmland in 
Koje, South Kyongsang Province. 
  Thanks to a bumper anchovy harvest, his father, Kim 
Hong-cho, 
increased his wealth by 425.38 million won, which he has 
deposited in three separate banks. 
  President Kim's wealth grew by 15.21 million won due to 
interest increases in his monthly savings while his father 
benefited from the fact that he can deposit all his earnings now 
that he no longer has to contribute to his son's political 
activities, according to Hong In-kil, senior presidential 
secretary for administrative affairs. 
  Another change in Kim's assets resulted from his second 
daughter-in-law's purchase of a used car for 6 million won last 
September.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry may 
decide to reduce the number of vice minister-level senior 
officials at the special grade one level by three to four a year 
over five years in a bid to cut staff and rationalize the 
organization's structure, officials said Tuesday. The Ministry 
is studying ways to eliminate the posts of 17 senior officials, 
according to the official. 
  A senior official at the Ministry said, "there has been 
criticism that the Ministry has too many special grade one 
officials and too few working-level officials. 
  "A recent meeting of the Ministry's senior officials almost 
agreed to the reduction of the organization's staff. If things 
go well, we plan to receive approval from the minister and 
revise the executive ordinance of the Public Servants' Law 
covering foreign affairs. We want to begin the reduction within 
the first half of this year." 
  Other ministries do not have the positions of special grade 
one or two level officials, which are unique to the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  Under the plan, the number of special grade one level 
officials will decrease from 47 to 30 over five years, while 
that of special grade two level officials at the assistant 
minister level will be maintained at the current 35. 
  In contrast, the number of grade one level officials will 
rise from the current 53 to 70.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- About 20,000 farmers and 
students staged a violent demonstration in downtown Seoul 
Tuesday afternoon, clashing with riot police and destroying 
police and other vehicles. About 60 demonstrators and policemen 
were injured. 
  Following a national farmers rally against the rice market 
opening, held at the Marronnier Park at Tongsung-tong at 1 PM, 
the participating farmers and students totaling about 20,000 
marched along the Chongno Street carrying placards that read, 
"Kim Yong-sam Government Should Step Down" and "Hold Uruguay 
Round Talks Again." 
  As the demonstrators tried to proceed toward the American 
Embassy and Chongwadae [presidential residence], police cordoned 
them off, in the course of which they violently clashed with 
stick-wielding demonstrators. 
  A group of demonstrators raided three unoccupied police 
buses 
near Samil Building, setting fire to one of them and smashing 
the windows of the two tohers. They also destoryed a nearby 
garbage truck and smashed the doors of a KBS sedan. 
  In another action, student demonstrators surrounded 100 riot 
police at Chongkye 2-ka and collected and set fire to their 
helmets, shields and gas masks. 
  The police decided to criminally punish those who took part 
in violence as well as those who organized the rally. 
  The rally was attended by Yi Ki-taek, head of the Democratic 
Party, 11 other opposition party lawmakers, and a number of 
dissident leaders.

  [Text] The Agency for National Security Planning (NSP), 
the nation's top intelligence agency, has established an 
"information center for international crimes" to tackle 
increasing terror, smuggling and narcotics-related crimes, the 
NSP announced yesterday. 
  The NSP will also open offices to receive reports on such 
crimes in five major cities--Seoul and port cities of Pusan, 
Inchon, Cheju and Masan. 
  An NSP spokesman said that the agency's move is to counter 
effectively the growing number of international organized crimes 
which occurred in the country recently. It is seen as part of 
the agency's effort to suit itself to the changing political and 
economic atmosphere. 
  The NSP will fight against such crimes in the context of 
national security, said the spokesman. 
  The spokesman said the newly established information center 
absorbs the "counter-narcotics information center" initiated 
last June. Last year, the counter-narcotics center collected 
over 300 pieces of drug-related information and distributed them 
to the prosecution, police and foreign intelligence agencies, 
according to the spokesman.

  [Text] The Economic Planning Board [EPB] yesterday 
announced the restructuring of the top economic policy-making 
body by trimming redundant organs. Under the plan, two 
assistant minister-level posts--assistant minister for 
international policy coordination and one in three standing 
members at the Fair Trade Commission [FTC]--were abolished. 
  The plan also called for abolishing two director-general 
posts, one in the international policy coordination office and 
economic information and education bureau. 
  At the same time, eight director-level posts in the 
international policy coordination office, economic information 
and education bureau and performance evaluation bureau were 
scrapped. 
  Instead, five director-level posts--three in the budget 
office and two in the FTC--will be established to adapt to the 
changing economic environment, resulting in a net loss of three 
director-level posts, EPB officials said. 
  The EPB said the organizational change came in response to a 
widely-claimed principle for a "small but efficient" government 
which President Kim Yong-sam has advocated consistently since 
taking office last February. 
  Analysts said the EPB moves will spark a chain reaction to 
slim down other government ministries which have been concerned 
about public clamor for a small government. 
  Under the plan, an assistant economic planning minister will 
be authorized to oversee the function of the now-defunct 
assistant minister for international policy coordination. 
  The international policy coordination office will be scaled 
down to a bureau which will encompass five divisions and will be 
led by two directors general. 
  The most striking of the EPB's organizational changes was to 
establish a new bureau commissioned by a director general fully 
in charge of the defense budget in the budget office. 
  The EPB said the establishment of a new bureau in the budget 
office is aimed at making a thorough examination of the defense 
budget which has long remained as a sanctuary in the government 
budgeting process. 
  Analysts said now the EPB will be able to examine government 
outlays made under the Yulgok military buildup program, which 
has stirred a major controversy over irregularities recently.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- There are numerous 
indications that the South Korean economy is poised for recovery 
as hope of a coming boom spreads throughout the business 
community, though the degree of such expectations differs by 
industry. 
  The semiconductor industry has become one of the leading 
players in the economy's upward movement, thanks to the 
expanding world chip market and the competitive edge of Korean 
chips in quality and price over their rivals on the world market. 
  A semiconductor department official at Samsung Electronics 
Co. said, "the state of meeting 80 percent to 90 percent of our 
orders is continuing into this year. Our exports in January are 
likely to exceed the year-on-year rise of 80 percent we recorded 
a year earlier because exports in January last year were not 
very brisk." 
  The automobile industry is also enjoying brisk business. 
  A Hyundai motor official said his company's exports and 
domestic sales in January should increase 50 percent and 15 
percent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis, though January 
and February are usually the off-season for the car industry. 
  "We expect domestic sales in January to increase 25 percent 
from a year earlier, and I think exports will start increasing 
sharply in March though they were slow in January," said Kang 
Yong-ho, a Daewoo Motor board member. 
  The improving electronics and automobile industries are 
pulling up the steel industry, as they are major users of steel. 
  Yi Ku-taek, executive director of Pohang Iron and Steel Co., 
was happy about the improvement: "Business started improving in 
January, and we expect sales of steel plates and sheets to 
increase more than nine percent this year." 
  The consumer electronics industry anticipates that it will 
achieve growth of 10 pecent to 15 percent in the coming year. 
  "The strong yen and the resulting hardships facing Japanese 
firms, the U.S. market's recovery, labor peace, low oil prices 
and the stabilized exchange rate of the won against major 
foreign currencies will push up exports of consumer electronics 
goods more than 20 percent in 1994," Yi Pyong-song, a board 
member of Goldstar Co., predicted. 
  Seoul's department stores, which ran a 10-day sale last 
month, expect to record sales growth of more than 30 percent in 
January. With the lunar new year season coming in the second 
week of February and the spring fashion sales in March, they 
anticipate no recession in 1994. The situation is just the 
opposite, however, in the traditonal marketplaces. Although 
lunar new year's day is only 10 days away, Namdaemun Market 
merchants are complaining that they alone remain mired in 
recession. 
  A dealer in children's clothes said, "my sales these days 
are 
less than half of what I sold a year ago." 
  The shipbuilding industry, which enjoyed a big boom last 
year, is not very optimistic about its prospects for the coming 
year. The industry has enough orders to keep it busy until the 
end of next year but the Japanese, who are striving to recapture 
their place as the world's top shipbuilders, pose a formidable 
challenge. Moreover, the cargo shipping industry shows few signs 
of expansion or a business upturn. 
  Kim Yon-sin, planning officer of Daewoo Shipbuilding and 
Heavy Machinery, said, "we can hardly expect as good a business 
in the new year as we enjoyed last year. One of the reasons is 
that shipyards' excessive competition for expansion makes 
shipping firms put off placing orders for new ships until the 
race is over."

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 31 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
has predicted that North Korea's nuclear issue will be solved in 
one way or another within this year to provide a turning point 
for inter-Korean relations. 
  When the nuclear issue is solved, the government will 
promote 
active cooperation and exchange programs with North Korea under 
the three-stage unification policy which calls for 
reconciliation and cooperation, the formation of commonwealth 
and reunification. 
  The chief executive made the prediction after he was briefed 
by Secretary General Yu Kyong-hyon of the Advisory Council on 
Democratic and Peaceful Unification on the council's programs 
for 1994 at Chongwadae [presidential offices] on Monday morning. 
  He stressed the need for national preparations for 
unification, saying unification is not only a hopeful future of 
the nation but also a challenge testing the nation's economic 
and social power. 
  The council must take its root in the people as a trusted 
unification organization and seek to achieve national consensus 
on unification. 
  Kim called on the council to increase the use of some 1,000 
members in 46 countries for stepped-up overseas programs, saying 
an approach to North Korea's closed society through overseas 
Koreans may be effective in creating a unification environment 
in the North. 
  In his briefing, Secretary General Yu said the council would 
focus its overseas programs on Korean communities of more than 
10,000 in Japan, the United States, Germany, Canada and other 
countries and increase exchange programs with ethnic Koreans in 
China in a bid to win their support for Korean reunification. 
  The council will prepare several unification scenarios and 
increase both direct and indirect programs designed to help 
North Korea open its doors to the world. 
  To provide students and housewives with an opportunity to 
discuss their views of unification and thus to achieve national 
consensus, the council will provide unification forums and 
classes for them. 
  Yu said the council would name some 300 specialists as 
monitors of the developments of North Korean and international 
situations related to Korean unification to make trustworthy 
unification policy recommendations to the government.

  [Text] Opposition Democratic Party [DP] leader Yi Ki-taek 
said yesterday that he is opposed to any international sanctions 
against Pyongyang to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  "I expect the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula to be 
settled in a peaceful way within this year," Yi said in a news 
conference with the Seoul Foreign Correspondents' Club held at 
the Press Center, downtown Seoul. 
  Commenting on the declaration by the Seoul and Pyongyang 
governments on denuclearization of the peninsula in 1992, Yi 
said peaceful use of the nuclear energy should not be hindered. 
  "For the same reason, I object to turning the declaration 
into an international treaty," Yi said. Yi reaffirmed his 
position on his plan to meet with North Korean President Kim 
Il-song in Pyongyang. 
  "As soon as the special National Assembly session winds up 
in 
early March, I will file an application with the government to 
visit North Korea," said Yi. 
  "I will discuss with Kim Il-song various pending 
inter-Korean 
issues such as the easing of tensions on the peninsula, 
resumption of talks, economic cooperation, and reunion of 
separated families," he added. 
  Yi said a recent poll by the DP found 55 percent of the 
people in favor of his planned visit to Pyongyang, while just 22 
percent responded negatively. 
  The opposition leader also urged the administration to show 
more independent attitude toward the negotiations to solve the 
North Korean nuclear problem. 
  "The absence of Seoul negotiators in the talks to settle the 
nuclear issue can be serious obstacle to the national 
unification," Yi said. 
  "The government should break away from the practice of 
depending too much on the United States," he said. 
  Yi made clear again that the main opposition party will veto 
the Uruguay Round trade deal at the Assembly, saying that 
domestic rice market liberalization is certain to "destroy" the 
farming community.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 28 (YONHAP) -- The government on Friday 
announced a set of second-stage measures to discourage the 
overheating of the stock exchange. 
  The steps came on heels of a steep rise of share prices to 
the highest in four years. 
  The new measures feature expanding the volume of shares to 
be 
additionally supplied to the market by 3,200 billion won worth 
of shares from the initially planned 7,000 billion won worth to 
10,200 billion won. 
  Securities authorities announced the first-stage measures to 
contain excessive stock price increase on last Jan. 17. 
  The government also decided to prepare very shortly steps to 
have the stock market stabilization fund sell off those shares 
it holds whose prices have risen recently and buy low-priced 
issues instead. 
  The 3,200-billion-won increase in the volume of additional 
supply of shares is set to be made through the listing of some 
unlisted firms, selling of those shares held by institutional 
investors, and the selling of government-held shares of those 
public banks set to be privatized. 
  Depending on the effect these second-stage steps will have 
on 
the stock market, the government will, if it is deemed 
necessary, allow banking institutions to increase their capital 
beginning May this year.

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance yesterday approved the 
Hyundai Business Group's plan to take over a U.S. computer parts 
maker for $150 million. Hyundai Electronic Industries Co. and 
three other Hyundai corporations contracted to buy Maxtor Co., a 
San Jose-based hard disc manufacturer, last August. The Hyundai 
companies agreed to finance their acquisition with a loan from 
Citibank, a U.S. bank which Hyundai said has promised to lend 
$150 million. 
  The takeover of Maxtor, the fifth largest hard disc 
manufacturer in the world, which has production lines in Hong 
Kong and Singapore, is certain to add muscle to the Hyundai 
Business Group's electronics division. To obtain approval for 
its takeover plan, a government official said, the Hyundai 
Business Group lobbied hard at the Economic Planning Board, the 
Ministry of Trade, Industry Energy, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs as well as the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of 
Korea. Officials from these government agencies form the 
committee deliberating on foreign direct investments, chaired by 
Yim Chang-yol, second assistant minister of finance. Instead of 
holding a meeting on Hyundai's acquisition plan, the committee 
received written opinions from its members by Friday. 
  Based on the committee members' opinions in favor of 
Hyundai, 
the Ministry of Finance instructed the Bank of Korea yesterday 
morning to give a green light to the takeover plan. Does this 
approval by the ministry signal any change in the government 
attitude toward the Hyundai Business Group, whose founder Chong 
Chu-yong antagonized President Kim Yong-sam by challenging him 
in the presidential election in December 1992? There are signs 
of improving relations between the government and the Hyundai 
Business Group. 
  When he encountered Chong at Korea University where the late 
honorary chairman of a vernacular newspaper lay in state last 
week, President Kim smiled and shook hands with the Hyundai 
founder. Another sign of improvement came earlier this month 
when the Bank of Korea approved Hyundai Motor Co.'s plan to 
invest $6.8 million in a joint venture auto company with a 
Malaysian corporation. 
  Despite these signs of improvement, however, it may be too 
early to say that the government has buried the hatchet. Though 
it has approved Hyundai's plans for investments abroad, the 
government is holding back its decision on Hyundai's plans to 
raise funds for investment in the nation. The Hyundai Business 
Group has applied to the Korea Development Bank for 832 billion 
won in loans to finance its auto, electronics projects and other 
projects. 
  It is apparent the government-owned bank cannot make any 
decision on the issue without a cue from the government, 
although an official from the Ministry of Finance maintained 
that his ministry is not involved in any specific loan request 
to the bank. In addition, the Securities Supervisory Board has 
not allowed Hyundai Housing and Industrial Development Co. and 
three other Hyundai corporations yet to sell their stocks over 
the counter.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- Consumer and producer 
prices in January rose 1.3 percent and 1.1 percent, 
respectively, from December, according to the National 
Statistical Office and the Bank of Korea. 
  The figures were up 0.5 percentage point from the increase 
recorded a year earlier for consumer prices and 0.7 percentage 
point for producer prices, largely due to higher oil, cigarette 
and farm prices. Farm prices rose 3.7 percent and livestock 
prices went up 1.7 percent, while fish prices dipped 0.3 
percent. Fresh food prices as a whole surged 3.9 percent 
compared with the 3.6 percent registered in January last year. 
  Processed food prices inched up 0.7 percent and public 
utility charges increased 1.3 percent. 
  Steel prices rose, while the prices of whiskey, video-tape 
recorders and ready-made concrete fell. 
  Chong Chae-yong, the Economic Planning Board official in 
charge of price policy, on Tuesday blamed higher cigarette and 
oil taxes and the lean crops caused by last year's cold summer 
for the sharp consumer price hike in January, but said prices 
would stablize in the second quarter to record a six-percent 
increase for the whole of this year, the same inflation level as 
last year.

  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has expressed regret 
over tendencies of the Sabah United Party, PBS, State Government 
to use sentiments to cover up economic and development problems 
in its bid to retain power in the state. He said PBS leaders 
were willing to do anything to ensure their continued 
administration in the state, including the use of sentiments and 
creating hatred toward the federal government. The prime 
minister was addressing a dinner function organized by the Sabah 
Bumiputera [Indigenous]-Chinese chambers of commerce and 
industry in Kota Kinabalu last night. 
  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir clarified that the political 
stability 
and peace was the main factor for the rapid economic development 
in the country, which is able to maintain a growth rate of eight 
percent for six consecutive years. However, according to him, 
this was the national average per se. States like Pahang, 
Johor, and Melaka have achieved a 13-percent growth rate, while 
Sabah has recorded the lowest growth rate -- just a mere four 
percent. The prime minister explained that the federal 
government has no ill intention toward the people of Sabah and 
the federal government will assist a state toward development 
for the benefit of all the people in that state.

  [Excerpts] Malaysia achieved a trade surplus of RM3.9 
billion [Malaysian currency] for January to October 1993, 
compared with a smaller surplus of RM648.2 million during the 
corresponding period of 1992. 
  The Statistics Department reported that the improved trade 
position was due to stronger demand, which induced higher export 
growth compared with that of imports. Exports expanded by 18 
percent from the 10 months in 1992 to RM100.2 billion as against 
a 14.3 percent growth in imports at RM96.3 billion. [passage 
omitted] 
  For the 10-month period under review, the acceleration of 
export growth was largely contributed by significant increases 
in the exports of manufactured goods (+36.8 percent), machinery 
and transport equipment (+29.7 percent) and miscellaneous 
manufactured articles (+10.7 percent). These three major 
components contributed to 67.9 percent of total export earnings. 
  The department reported that exports of mineral fuel, the 
second largest contributor to export value, experienced a 
reduction of 5.2 percent in earnings when compared with the same 
period in 1992. 
  The growth in imports was largely contributed by higher 
imports of machinery and transport equipment (+16.6 percent), 
which accounted for 55.7 percent of total import receipts. 
  Malaysia's major trading partners during January-October 
1993 
were Japan, the United States, Singapre, Taiwan, Germany, the 
United Kingdom, South Korea and Hong Kong, which collectively 
accounted for 75.4 percent of the total trade.

  [Text] Prime Minister Hosokawa, who is set to hold talks 
with President Clinton on 11 February, will leave Japan on 10 
February and return home on 13 February. This schedule was 
disclosed by the prime minister at a 31 January meeting of 
leaders of the government and ruling coalition parties. During 
the meeting, the prime minister expressed his eagerness to 
settle the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which have 
continued to run into rough sailing, saying, "I intend to make 
the utmost effort to settle the talks." As for the issue of tax 
cuts which the United Sates has sought persistently as a means 
to expand Japan's domestic demand, both the government and the 
ruling coalition parties will decide on a rough outline for 
reforming the current tax system by 2 February and the 
government will announce a new package of stimulus measures on 3 
February. These quick moves by the government and the ruling 
coalition parties reveal their intentions to take steps which 
could fulfill U.S. expectations of Japan in the macroeconomics 
field including tax cuts amid a stalemate in the Japan-U.S. 
negotiations on the microeconomic field including automobile and 
auto parts. 
  At a meeting with the prime minister at his official 
residence on 23 January shortly after the rejection of a package 
of political reform bills in the House of Councilors, U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Bentsen said in a soft tone: "The income tax 
reduction is important from the point of expanding Japan's 
domestic demand. If the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks make 
little headway prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, there would 
be various moves in the United States to take legal actions." 
During the meeting, Treasury Secretary Bentsen made one request 
after another, while mentioning the U.S. Government's 
expectations on the prime minister. The prime minister 
undoubtedly felt keenly a grim mood and moves in the United 
States toward reviving the Super 301 provision of the 1988 
Omnibus Trade Act. Speaking at a 26 January news conference, he 
said, "Mr.Bentsen told me about tough requests." 
  At noon on 31 January, the prime minister spoke by telephone 
with President Clinton. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura said, 
"I cannot give details of what leaders of the two countries 
talked on the telephone." In this way, the telephone 
conversation between the prime minister and President Clinton 
has not been made public. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, 
however, said, "The President manifested U.S. expectations on 
Japan for Japan-U.S. economic framework talks and stimulus 
measures." The President is believed to have made requests for 
tax cuts and other issues. 
  With the Japan-U.S. summit talks 10 days away, the 
Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks remain deadlocked. While the prime 
minister has expressed his intention to display his political 
leadership in order to settle the talks, pessimism is voiced 
within the government that the settlement of negotiations on 
automobile and auto parts would be deferred until later. 
  At the present stage, the United States is responding 
favorably to the prime ministers' policy for changes. Although 
changes in Japan, which the United States has sought, are things 
that Japan should do for its own sake, it is not easy for the 
prime minister to coordinate views of people in the government 
and the ruling coalition parties. It can be said that the prime 
minister is sandwiched between the U.S. expectations on Japan 
and his task of coordinating the views at home.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Way Out is Still Not in Sight For </F>
Japan-U.S. Economic Framework Talks"] 
  [Text] With the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit talks 10 
days away, the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are entering 
the 11th hour. U.S. Trade Representative Kantor will arrive in 
Japan on 1 February and emergency Japan-U.S. ministerial talks 
will be held in Tokyo. The United States aims to break the 
deadlock in the Japan-U.S. negotiations on the three sectors of 
"government procurement, "automobile-auto parts" and 
"insurance," but differences between the two countries still 
remain wide. Hence, the two countries are likely to repeat a 
heated exchange shortly before the summit talks. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
says: 
"The heavy burden of politics has now been removed ...." The 
Foreign Ministry, MITI, and other ministries in charge of the 
Japan- U.S. economic framework talks now feel relieved. They do 
so because the United States was in the mood to carefully watch 
the future of the Hosokawa government and the political upheaval 
in Japan was casting a chill on the talks. 
  A working-level meeting on the government procurement 
(telecommunications) will begin on 1 February and the vice 
ministerial talks are expected to be held this weekend. The 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks will enter the final stage. 
  Invariably, the future of the talks remains uncertain. MITI 
Deputy Minister Okamatsu, who negotiated with the U.S. side 
until last week in Washington, told a news conference that "both 
sides made clear their positions." In this way, he revealed the 
existence of differences between the two countries. 
  What has become an issue between Japan and the United States 
is setting an "objective criteria" to measure foreign access to 
the Japanese market. Negotiations on the automobile and auto 
parts and vice ministerial talks held in Washington discussed a 
U.S. proposal for setting the objective criteria, but failed to 
hammer out an agreement. While the United States is seeking a 
future indicator, Japan is making clear its position that it 
does not care about simply monitoring the past data, but "it 
cannot accept anything that will become a de facto numerical 
target." As a result, no compromise is in sight. 
  The U.S. Government has decided to send U.S. Trade 
Representative Kantor to Japan because it is irritated with a 
rough sailing in negotiations between bureaucrats of the two 
countries. A senior MITI official suggests that "the United 
States might intend to sound out Japan's intentions through 
contacts with cabinet ministers." The United States, however, 
takes the view that the enactment of a package of political 
reform bills in the Diet has bailed the Hosokawa government out 
of the political crisis and U.S. Trade Representative Kantor 
will thrust upon Japan to cut taxes deeply and go along with the 
U.S. proposal for setting the numerical targets. 
  Japan cannot accept the U.S. proposal for setting the 
numerical targets, but it is hard for Japan to rebuff the U.S. 
proposal on the eve of the Japan-U.S. summit talks. It seems 
that at the ministerial talks, Japan will be pressed to make 
hard choices.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Toshihiko Kashiwa] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 26 Jan -- A Japanese-led consortium will be 
formed for an oil-refinery modernization project in Kazakhstan, 
a Central Asian nation. Nichimen Corporation will formally 
conclude a contract with the Kazakh Government on behalf of 
Japanese partners in the consortium. The total project cost is 
estimated at $1.2 billion and the Japanese partners are likely 
to win a more than $600-million contract. The Bank of Export 
and Import of Japan is committed to extending $300 million in 
loans to Kazakhstan and it is highly possible that Japan's trade 
insurance will be applied for the first time to that country. 
The Japanese Government and oil companies, that are eager to 
diversify energy supply sources for Japan and increase Japan's 
aid to former Soviet republics other than Russia, are eyeing 
Central Asian nations that are rich in resources. The 
oil-refinery modernization project is likely to provide an 
impetus for improving relations between Japan and Central Asian 
nations. 
  The Japanese partners in the oil-refinery modernization 
project are three general trading firms -- Nissho Corporation, 
Marubeni Corporation, and Itochu Corporation -- and Chiyoda 
Corporation and JGC Corporation. 
  The Kazakh oil refinery to be modernized under the project 
is 
the Adeirau [name as published] Oil Refinery on the northern 
coast of the Caspian Sea, which was built with U.S. aid. The 
refinery, which went into operation in 1945, is highly obsolete. 
The oil refinery is known to be capable of refining 6 million 
tons of oil a year, but its capacity has dropped to 4.5 million 
tons. The oil-refinery modernization project will bring its 
capacity back to 6 million tons by replacing one refinery 
facility with two oil facilities. The project also will improve 
the oil refinery's productivity by raising the refining rate of 
lead-free diesel and gasoline. 
  With regard to the project, Hydra Carbon Engineering [name 
as 
published], a French firm, and Ronald Service, a British firm, 
that had continued to negotiate with the Kazakhs, concluded a 
basic contract last summer. Later, however, the two European 
firms were found to be unable to implement the project. For 
this reason, the six Japanese firms and Fueros Tal [name as 
published], a German construction firm, have been asked to 
participate in the project.

January. Touching on the question of Japan's sending personnel 
to the former Yugoslavia to participate in UN Peacekeeping 
Operations (PKO), Hata said: "From an official standpoint, the 
overall situation has not met with the five principles on PKO 
participation (such as a cease-fire accord) yet. We will have 
to clarify this point." Thus, he indicated his view that the 
current situation in the former Yugoslavia does not fulfill the 
five principles.

"Changes in Japan's Trade Structure and Foreign Direct 
Investments"] 
<H5>  [Sep 93 pp 21-28] </H5>
  [Text] Foreign direct investments have played an 
increasingly important role in the international economy since 
the latter half of the 1980's. While world trade grew steadily 
at an annual rate of 13 percent from 1985 to 1990, foreign 
direct investments, showing even greater growth, expanded at an 
annual rate of 34 percent. In the midst of these changes in the 
world economy, we see the rapid growth of Japanese foreign 
direct investments since the Plaza Accord of 1985 as well as 
changes in Japan's trade structure. 
  In view of these changes, the International Research 
Section of the Ministry of Finance [MOF] Customs and Tariff 
Bureau conducted a survey over a one-year period to address the 
following and other questions: 1) how has the expansion of 
foreign direct investments changed Japan's trade structure; 2) 
what kinds of changes have occurred with respect to Japan's 
international air cargo industry along with these other changes; 
and 3) what is the status of attempts by Japanese enterprises, 
which underlie these changes in the trade structure, to localize 
production? Here and in the following (October) issue, we would 
like to introduce findings from this survey regarding changes in 
Japan's trade structure from the latter half of the 1980's 
through 1992. 
<H5>  I. Introduction </H5>
  During the latter half of the 1980's, Japan's trade 
structure 
underwent dynamic changes both in terms of imports and exports. 
Using figures indicating the volume of trade in terms of 
quantity [e.g., number of cars exported] rather than in just 
dollar amounts, which is a less accurate measure of volume, we 
see that during the first half of the 1980's (specifically, in 
1980, 1981 and 1984), with the yen still weak, exports grew at a 
two-digit rate. That changed to a single-digit, however, from 
1987. In 1992, the rate of growth in exports had fallen to 0.2 
percent due to the J-curve effect following the yen's 
appreciation and to more higher value added export items (Tables 
1 and 2). 
  For example, in the case of automobiles, which were Japan's 
leading export through the 1980's, making up almost 20 percent 
of all Japanese exports during that period, exports, as measured 
in dollars, continued to grow while the actual number of cars 
shipped from Japan fell (from 7.01 million cars in 1986 to 6 
million in 1992), indicating that the growth in exports was due 
to price factors rather than to a change in the number of cars 
being exported. 
  Again, along with a growth in foreign direct investments by 
Japan's enterprises, growth in export parts (for example, 
semiconductor and electronic parts, car parts and engines), 
which were hard to secure in the countries where Japanese 
enterprises had set up their branch operations, became a 
characteristic of the export trade during the latter half of the 
1980's (Table 3).

  During the early half of the 1980's (specifically, in 1980, 
1981, and 1982), the number of imports fell but, from 1986, has 
been increasing at a higher rate due to expanding domestic 
demand (Table 1 and 2). Specifically, from the latter half of 
the 1980's, clothing, office machinery (such as computers), 
semiconductors and electronic parts (such as integrated 
circuits) and audio-video equipment (color televisions, VTR's) 
have all shown significant increases (Table 4). 
  The decline in the volume of manufactured imported products 
in 1992 was due to a decline in luxury items such as cars, gold, 
diamonds and paintings as well as in steel and nonferrous metals 
(aluminum, aluminum alloys, copper and copper alloys), the 
result of the bubble economy's collapse and the domestic 
economy's entering an adjustment phase. Where local production 
by Japanese enterprises had progressed--in apparel, office 
equipment, semiconductors and electronic parts, and audio and 
video equipment--imports continued to increase. 
  Behind such changes in the trade structure, we can find the 
influence of the yen's sharp rise in value following the Plaza 
Accord of 1985. The yen's appreciation lowered import prices 
(calculated on the basis of the yen) and weakened the ability of 
domestically manufactured goods to remain price-competitive. In 
order to respond to the yen's sharp rise and deal with trade 
problems, however, Japanese enterprises aggressively engaged in 
foreign direct investments and succeeded in transferring their 
production bases overseas. 
  As a result, re-imported products--for the most part mass 
market consumer products--penetrated the domestic market while 
exports, in order to keep the work force employed at home, 
centered on high value added items that could not be produced at 
overseas plants, thus creating specialization, or an 
international division of labor, in the production of 
manufactured goods. In the future, too, domestic and foreign 
economic trends permitting, Japanese enterprises are expected to 
expand their overseas operations even further, just as they have 
since the latter half of the 1980's, as long as yen continues 
its upward climb.

  This article will first examine trends in Japanese foreign 
direct investments, the engine behind changes in Japan's trade 
structure, in three areas: North America, Europe and Asia. A 
larger share of all foreign direct investments during the latter 
half of the 1980's was going to Asia, reflecting the importance 
placed on this region in the corporate strategies of Japanese 
enterprises. While we can gather from their profits that 
Japanese-owned enterprises engaged in local production in Europe 
and the United States are having a hard time, operations in Asia 
are proceeding smoothly, comparatively speaking, and in the 
future, we can expect the relative importance of this region for 
Japanese enterprises to increase even further. 
  Wide variations exist among different industries when it 
comes to local production. The picture, however, in terms of 
changes in trade structure due to foreign direct investments, 
when considered on an industry by industry basis (here, the 
automobile, consumer appliance and electronics, apparel, and 
steel industries will be considered), indicates that in each of 
these industries, manufacturers are exporting high value added 
products. On the other hand, the trend in imports is toward mass 
distribution consumer products. Thus, we can see that, in terms 
of exports and imports, an international division of labor, or 
"segregation of niche" [sumiwake] is developing. 
  During the latter half of the 1980's, a large wave of 
foreign 
direct investments was developing, even on an international 
scale, (with investments going from advanced countries to other 
advanced countries and from advanced countries to developing 
nations), and as a result, there has been a shift in the world's 
trade structure, including Japan's, from vertical to horizontal 
trade. This shift can be understood in terms of changes in the 
index of intra-industry trade (ITT), an indicator of the degree 
to which horizontal (intra-industry) trade has developed. Not 
only has Asia, a region actively receiving direct investments 
from advanced nations, including Japan, seen a brisk, quickening 
of trade, close trading ties within the region are developing as 
domestic demand among Asian countries expands. Changes in 
Japan's trade structure and in its regional ties can also be 
seen from the perspective of Japan's international air cargo. 
<H5>  II. Trends in Japanese Foreign Direct Investments </H5>
  1. General Remarks 
  From the end of the 1980's into the 1990's, foreign direct 
investments by Japanese enterprises have increased dramatically 
as companies have embarked on plans to transfer their domestic 
production bases overseas. This move has been in response to a 
downturn in the profitability of exports due to the yen's steep 
rise following the 1985 Plaza Accord and in response to 
voluntary export restrictions and worsening trade relations of 
the kind seen in anti-dumping suits (Table 5).

  Amounting to just $3.9 billion in 1986, foreign direct 
investments by Japanese manufacturing industries rose to $16.3 
billion in 1989, reaching an all time high. Although investments 
have dropped since 1990 for various reasons--the increasingly 
unpredictable nature of market trends due to a global slump, the 
difficulty of raising corporate funds following the collapse of 
Japan's bubble economy, and the completion of a round of plans 
by Japanese companies to build overseas production bases--the 
level of investments, in 1992 amounting to $10.1 million, still 
remains high when compared to the early half of the 1980's when 
investments were at around the $3 billion level. (It should be 
noted that, after an initial period of investments in local 
production, additional funds for plant facilities are often 
raised by companies in the country where those facilities are 
located and the connection between direct investments from Japan 
and the further development of local production becomes weaker.) 
  In considering regional changes in Japan's foreign direct 
investments, we see that North America was Japan's principal 
target for investors, their reasons for investing in this region 
being to maintain and expand their market shares and to develop 
new markets; additionally, investors have been motivated by the 
desire to avoid trade problems. As can be seen in responses to 
the questionnaire given to Japanese enterprises on their reasons 
for branching out overseas (Table 6), oftentimes the motive, in 
the case of North America and Europe was to cope with trade 
restrictions set up by their trading partners. In 1988, 67 
percent of [Japan's] foreign direct investments went to North 
America, but that figure has since dropped, falling to 42 
percent in 1992. Among the reasons for this decline are the 
business slump in the United States and the fact that Japanese 
enterprises have just finished a round of large-scale production 
projects (Table 7). 
  Europe's share of foreign direct investments, about 10 
percent, was relatively low until 1988, but with the economic 
unification of the European Community (EC) slated for 1992, 
Japanese-owned enterprises, believing they should try to gain 
"insider status," hurriedly began to move into the region from 
the latter half of the 1980's, bringing EC's share of Japanese 
investments to 30 percent in 1990. Because of the business slump 
in Europe, particularly in England, which receives from 
one-third to one-fourth of the direct investments from Japan 
(Table 7), less money is being invested in the area, and 
Europe's share dropped to 21 percent in 1992. 
  Ideally, there are two routes companies can take when moving 
into advanced market countries (i.e., North America and Europe): 
they can either set up their own production bases there through 
foreign direct investments (local production) or they can base 
their production on tie-ups with [local] enterprises (establish 
mutually complementary production relationships, OEM [original 
equipment manufacturer] tie-ups, technical tie-ups, or joint 
development). In recent years, rather than through foreign 
direct investments, more weight has been given to the latter 
route; namely, cooperative dealings between companies and joint 
technical development based on strategic tie-ups with foreign 
enterprises. As a result, Japanese companies have been placing 
less importance on foreign direct investments. 
  Asia, with its abundance of cheap labor, on the other hand, 
has been designated a production base for Japanese-owned 
enterprises and since 1988, has steadily been receiving a larger 
share of Japan's foreign direct investments. In 1992, this share 
reached an all time high of 31 percent. But even within the same 
region, interest has been shifting since 1990 from ASEAN 
[Association of Southeast Asian Nation] member countries to 
China. Thus, it seems that in recent years, Japan's foreign 
direct investments have been shifting from North America and 
Europe to Asia.

  2. Regional Trends in Japanese Foreign Direct 
Investments and the Earnings Situation of Japanese-Owned 
Enterprises 
  If we consider regional trends in foreign direct investments 
in terms of profits, we see that, according to a questionnaire 
survey (on the overseas business activities of Japanese 
companies), which was conducted by the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry [MITI], current profit-to-sales ratios for 
companies in North America and Europe are low and, in some 
cases, companies are even coming out with negative profit 
ratios. In Asia, on the other hand, current profit ratios for 
Japanese-owned companies are relatively high (Table 8).

  [Text]North America 
  In North America, current profit-to-sales ratios for 
Japanese-owned enterprises have been low, especially since 1990, 
when the situation took a sharp turn for the worse, and in 1992, 
a negative 1.9 percent figure was recorded. The following are 
among the factors thought to be responsible: 
  (1) North America was hit by a business recession during 
the start up period for large scale projects 
  (2) In order to manufacture high quality goods on a scale 
beyond a certain level, Japanese companies that have gone to 
North America often have capital-intensive facilities and, 
during their start-up period, have high depreciation costs and 
are also burdened by heavy interest payments. 
  Again, local sales ratios for Japanese-owned enterprises in 
North America are about 90 percent, and presumably having 
invested in order to secure a share of the local market, they 
may be sacrificing profits to a certain extent when they make 
their investments (Table 9.1).

  According to a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of 
Commerce regarding profits from foreign investments in the 
United States (Survey of Current Business, August 1992), the 
rate of return on investments by resident foreign enterprises 
falls below returns on the domestic and foreign investments of 
U.S. companies, leading one to suspect that low returns on 
investments in the United States are not a problem that only 
affects Japanese-owned enterprises (Table 10).

Europe 
  Current profit-to-sales ratios in Europe, though lower than 
in Japan for all domestic companies, were indicating profits 
until 1992 when, due to the recession, companies began showing 
negative returns and negative profit ratios of 0.6 percent. As 
in the case of North America, many of the companies branching 
out into Europe were doing so in response to trade problems 
related to automobiles and scientific and optical equipment such 
as duplicators and copying machines; but, for the most part, as 
concern grew about the "fortification of Europe" with the 
approaching unification of the EC in 1992, companies beat a 
hasty path to this region during the closing years of the 1980's 
in order to gain insider status so they could secure a piece of 
the European market. 
  Over 90 percent of the sales of locally produced goods in 
Europe comes from local markets. As in the case of the United 
States, Europe is not a manufacturing base for exports to 
countries, including Japan, that are outside of the region 
(Table 9.2)

  Asia 
  Not only are current profit-to-sales ratios higher in Asia 
than in North America and Europe, in 1990 and 1991, they were 
even higher than those of domestic enterprises. This is probably 
due to attempts to develop production networks there and to set 
the region up as a manufacturing base for exports to third-party 
countries outside of the region (such as the United States, 
Europe and Japan). In this respect, the region presents the 
following advantages: 
  (1) Labor costs in Asia are much cheaper than in 
economically more advanced countries 
  (2) Many of the manufacturers that have gone to Asia are 
labor-intensive, and depreciation costs and interest payment 
burdens are low. 
  The market for products made by Japanese-owned enterprises 
in 
Asia differs very much from those of Japanese companies in North 
America and Europe: local sales make up no more than slightly 
over half of all sales for Japanese companies in Asia, while 
exports to other countries outside the region, including Japan, 
make up a little under one-half (Table 9.3).

  Demand in Asia, considered the "world center of growth," is 
expected to expand even further in the future, and foreign 
companies, which were drawn to the area at first as a 
manufacturing base for exports to countries outside of the 
region (so-called roundabout exports) will probably be drawn 
increasingly to the area for its own markets. 
  However, even within this "world center of growth," regional 
differences of the type mentioned below are likely to occur, and 
this diversity should be kept in mind. 
  During the second half of the 1980's, Asia's newly 
developing 
economies [NIE's], which received foreign direct investments 
from Japan, all similarly underwent rapid growth. The 1990's, 
however, find Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore in 
different political and economic environments. In other words, 
the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong are in the process of 
merging with the economy of China, which has seen remarkable 
growth through the foreign direct investments of overseas 
Chinese merchants. Singapore's aim is to develop 
knowledge-intensive industries such as service industries and 
banking and financial services. On the other hand, Korea is 
shifting its emphasis from heavy and chemical industries (for 
example, steel and shipbuilding) to high-tech fields such as the 
semiconductor and computer industries. 
  From the end of the 1980's, wages in Asian newly 
industrializing economies soared, off-setting the advantages of 
local production originally undertaken because of their low 
wages. As a result, Japanese foreign direct investments were 
then targeted to ASEAN member countries, which became production 
bases for Japanese manufacturers, especially in the consumer 
appliance and electronics industries for products like air 
conditioners and VTR's. Wages in ASEAN countries have risen 
sharply, however, since 1991, and manufacturers are encountering 
such bottlenecks as inadequate infrastructure provisions and 
difficulties securing engineers and other personnel (these 
countries are having the same problem that Japan has had in 
filling undesirable, so-called 3K positions [jobs considered 
dangerous, difficult and dirty]. At present, ASEAN nations are 
undergoing an adjustment phase in their progress toward 
industrialization. 
  On the other hand, though Japanese direct investments in 
China have been low-pitched due to the Tianamen Square incident 
(June 1989) and to economic adjustment policies, the attention 
of Japanese enterprises at present seem to be focussing on 
China. This is due to such factors since 1991 as: (a) the 
deteriorating investment environment in ASEAN countries and the 
rapid emergence of China, with its conspicuously lower wages, as 
a local production base for Japanese enterprises; (b) the fact 
that, despite concerns about post-Deng Xiaoping political risks, 
China is promoting reform and a policy of openness; and (c) the 
expectation that domestic demand will expand, given China's 
population of 1.1 billion and its huge, potential market.

  [Excerpts] In the first installment of "Changes in 
Japan's Trade Structure and Foreign Direct Investments" 
(September 1993), we noted that significant changes had occurred 
in Japan's trade structure due to increased foreign direct 
investments during the latter half of the 1980's, including a 
growth in locally manufactured re-import items. Particularly 
noted was the growing importance of Asia as an overseas 
production base. To understand in greater detail (i.e., in micro 
terms) changes in our trade structure given the macro trends 
described earlier, we will look at these changes and trends in 
our foreign direct investments on an industry by industry basis. 
Since foreign direct investments increased during the latter 
half of the 1980's on a global scale, we will take a global 
perspective in considering these structural changes and 
trends. 
<H3>  III. Changes in Trade Structure and Foreign Direct 
Investments as Seen in Different Industries </H3>
  With regard to exports, a look at changes in trade structure 
and foreign direct investments as they apply to the different 
industries (automobiles, consumer appliances and electronics, 
apparel, and steel) generally indicates that, in each of these 
industries, there has been a furthering of local production 
through foreign direct investments (Table 11). However, because 
of difficulties in locally obtaining parts due to the weakness 
of supporting industries, Japan is also exporting more parts 
and, at the same time, is substituting among some of its exports 
finished goods (non-specialty items intended for the general 
market) that have been based on local production.

  On the reimport side, in the case of the auto industry, the 
numbers of reimported cars from the United States and elsewhere, 
though still small, are growing. In the apparel and consumer 
appliance and electronics industries, where local production has 
been undertaken primarily to take advantage of low-waged, local 
labor, there has been a steady growth in reimports from Asia 
that have been locally produced. The situation in the steel 
industry, where local production has been undertaken primarily 
as a way of dealing with trade frictions, however, does not 
indicate any growth in reimports based on foreign direct 
investments. 
  1. Auto Industry 
  The auto industry started moving its operations overseas 
from 
the early half of the 1980's, beginning with North America. 
Initially acting in response to voluntary export restrictions, 
the industry speeded this process up from 1985, when the yen 
suddenly gained in value. Local production in Europe started 
from the latter half of the 1980's in response to trade problems 
between the United States and Japan and grew out of the desire 
by Japanese auto makers to gain insider status in light of EC's 
pending economic unification Table 12).

  At first, auto makers had no intention of exporting cars 
back 
to Japan that had been locally produced, but from 1988, 
primarily from concerns about trade friction, they began to 
re-export a small number of passenger cars that had been made in 
the United States and Europe. The number of re-exported cars in 
1992 was 26,000, or about 14 percent of Japan's imported car 
market (of 181,000 cars). 
  The market for passenger cars in Asia (Asian NIE's and ASEAN 
countries, excluding Borneo) is not as large as it is in 
advanced countries (in 1992, 1.448 million cars were sold in 
Asia), but as motorization progresses, Japanese-owned 
enterprises are expected to put more effort into strengthening 
local production. 
  A sharp growth in the export of parts, including car parts 
and engines, has accompanied the development of local production 
bases in regions throughout the world (Table 13). 
  To take the export of passenger cars to the United States as 
an example, we see that, in 1986, 2.348 million cars were 
exported [to the United States], as compared to 508,000 cars 
that were locally produced. In 1992, however, the number of 
exported cars fell to 1.584 million while the figure for locally 
produced cars rose to 1.416 million cars, indicating that 
exports from Japan are being replaced by local production. The 
same trend appears in the EC market. Though the car market has 
been in a slump, operations have begun at plants built through 
Japanese direct investments, and the figures for 1992 show a 
decline in the number of passenger cars being exported from 
Japan.

  2. Consumer Appliance and Electronics Industries 
  The consumer appliance and electronics industries set up 
branch operations in North America, Europe and Asia from a 
relatively early date. Moving into North America and Europe in 
response to trade problems, these industries are eyeing local 
sales in these two regions. In Asia, particularly the ASEAN 
countries, the aim has been to set up export supply 
bases--production bases from which to export products to North 
America and Europe--rather than local sales (Table 14).

Looking at the products exported to Japan (re-imports), we 
see that they range widely from audio and video equipment such 
as VTR's and televisions to office equipment and high tech 
semiconductors and electronic parts. Thus, along with active 
local production in Asia, there has been a growth in exports to 
the region of semiconductors and electronic parts (primarily 
used for assembling consumer appliances and electronic 
equipment), which are hard to secure locally (Table 15).

  From the latter half of the 1980's, Japanese-owned 
enterprises have been introducing the newest technology to ASEAN 
countries as they set up their branch operations there. Thus, 
since 1990, we see the volume of re-imports from these countries 
in terms of the consumer electronics industry rapidly 
approaching the volume of re-imports from Asian NIE's. In 
looking for the factors behind this remarkable progress in ASEAN 
member-countries, we should point out that Japanese enterprises 
had to transfer their operations to Korea and the other newly 
industrialized economies of Asia gradually while, at the same 
time, adjusting their production process to existing local 
industries; in the ASEAN case, however, the entire process could 
be transferred from Japan in one piece, thus making it easier to 
introduce the latest technology more effectively (Tables 16 and 
17).

  With the political situation turning more stable and the 
government adopting a policy of openness and reform, Japanese 
enterprises have also been establishing production bases since 
1990 in China, where labor costs are extremely low. Within 
China, durable consumer goods like refrigerators, washing 
machines and television sets--consumer products that are 
becoming part of the necessities of daily life--are coming into 
general use, and manufacturers are anticipating growth in the 
durable consumer market and products like air conditioners and 
audio-video equipment along with a rise in China's standard of 
living. 
  3. Apparel Industry 
  The apparel industry is labor-intensive, and because it 
became less profitable to export apparel from Japan when the yen 
gained strength following the Plaza Accord, Japanese enterprises 
have gone about aggressively setting up local production 
facilities in Asia in order to utilize the region's relatively 
cheap labor (Table 18). China, where labor costs are especially 
cheap, has emerged as an important production base for mass 
market apparel. At the present time, however, technical 
standards for cloth and dying and quality control are still 
inadequate, and quality control is being handled in Japan. Cut 
cloth is then exported and sewn and assembled locally. Thus, 
there has developed a form of specialization or division of 
labor. 
  Statistical data clearly show changes of this kind with 
regard to Japan's import partners. Until 1990, Korea was the 
apparel industries number one importer; then, from 1991, when 
wages went up and Korea lost its price-competitiveness, China 
assumed that head position (Table 19). 
  While inexpensive (mass market) apparel is being imported 
from Asia, domestic apparel makers are manufacturing expensive 
items (high value added items whose selling point is superior 
design), which cannot be produced overseas, and are thus 
creating a division of labor in terms of imported items and 
domestically manufactured items.

  4. Steel Industry 
  In addition to being one of the items subject to managed 
trade and to voluntary export restrictions, steel exports have 
dropped in volume (quantitatively) because they have become less 
price-competitive following the yen's appreciation after the 
Plaza Accord. However, the total dollar amount of steel exports 
has shown very little change, and proportionally more high value 
added items are being exported Table 20). Specifically, while 
high value added export items like surface treated steel 
sheeting (for use in auto bodies and treated to prevent 
corrosion) and special steel materials exports are increasing, 
the export of low value added products like hot rolled steel and 
bar iron is decreasing (Table 21). 
  On the other hand, the trend seems to be toward a steady 
growth in imports from Taiwan and Korea, both in terms of 
quantitative and cash volume. (In 1992, however, there was a 
large drop in import volume because the domestic economy was 
entering an adjustment phase.) Types of steel materials being 
imported are for the most part low value added products like pig 
iron, semi-finished steel ingot products and hot rolled steel 
sheets (Table 22). A comparison of unit prices for imports and 
exports indicates that the latter is about twice that for 
imports, indicating the development of a "segregation of niche" 
(Table 20). 
  In the United States, where the steel industry's primary 
overseas expansion has occurred, Japanese steel makers, 
responding to concerns about U.S.-Japan trade friction, began by 
providing U.S. manufacturers with technical assistance and, at 
present, are undertaking production in the form of mergers with 
U.S. steel manufacturers. This does not mean, however, that 
re-imported steel from the United States has increased; rather 
products manufactured in the United States are being sold on 
the local market. Japanese steel makers have also provided 
technical cooperation to developing nations, and as the 
technical level in those countries improves, inexpensive steel 
will probably start being exported to Japan in earnest (Table 
23.) [passage omitted]

<H3>  V. Changes in Trade Structure as Seen From the Perspective 
of International Air Cargo </H3>
  From the latter half of the 1980's, a structural change has 
been occurring in Japanese industries, with a move away from 
large-scale and heavy industries (e.g., steel and shipbuilding), 
where there has been declining price competitiveness, toward 
high value added light industries (semiconductors and electronic 
parts, office equipment, scientific and optical equipment, and 
video equipment). Also, with the transfer of production bases 
overseas, there has been an increase in the transport of 
materials and assembly parts as well as maintenance parts to 
service equipment and machinery. In order to meet delivery 
deadlines, air cargo services are being utilized. Moreover, 
along with the global development of horizontal trade 
(intra-industry trade), Japan's volume of high value added 
import products has also increased. 
  Through these changes, there has been a shift (particularly 
noticeable with exports) from surface freight to air cargo in 
terms of international distribution. This shift can be traced, 
using as our indicator the ratio of air cargo export volume to 
total export volume. In terms of the dollar-valued amount of 
this air cargo, too, we can see that, regionally, there has been 
a deepening of economic ties with Asia (Asian NIE's and ASEAN 
countries) where Japanese enterprises have established 
production bases. 
  1. Increasing Ratio of Air Cargo 
  Because there has been a shift in Japan's export structure 
toward high value added industries and, along with foreign 
direct investments by Japanese enterprises, an increase in 
exported parts from Japan, there has also been a steady growth 
in exports shipped as air cargo. Specifically, 1970 figures 
indicate a 4.1 percent growth in the dollar-valued ratio of air 
cargo exports to total exports and a 0.2 percent increase in 
tonnage. By 1992, these ratios had climbed to 15.8 percent and 
0.7 percent, respectively (Table 27). 
  With an increasing volume of high value added imports like 
diamonds, pharmaceutical goods, semiconductors and electronic 
parts and office equipment, there has also been a growth in air 
cargo on the import front. In 1970, the dollar-valued ratio of 
air cargo imports to total imports rose by 7.9 percent and, in 
terms of tonnage, by 0.01 percent. By 1992, these figures had 
grown to 21.1 percent and 0.13 percent, respectively. The 
percentages are low when considering tonnage, but that is 
because heavy raw materials and resources like crude oil and 
liquified natural gas make up a large percentage of Japan's 
import structure (Table 28). 
  Carriage rates for air cargo are about ten times that for 
sea 
freight, so during recessions, companies will send via sea 
rather than air in order to cut down on their operating expenses 
(in other words, in the short term, the ratio of air-to-sea for 
international delivery will be influenced by economic trends). 
Since 1991, when Japan's economy entered an adjustment phase, 
companies have been increasingly conscious of the mounting 
distribution costs associated with just-in-time (JIT) 
deliveries--an accommodation to the small volume, diversified 
product approach taken by manufacturers in recent years--and the 
pressure these costs are placing on profits. In terms of both 
exports and imports, then, there has been a tendency toward 
stagnant or falling growth rates in air cargo and, in fact, for 
two years straight--from 1991 through 1992--the dollar amount of 
air cargo imports fell in absolute terms. From the beginning of 
1993, however, the volume of air cargo imports (in dollars) 
appears to be rising. 
  In terms of predominant trends, we can expect Japan's 
manufactured exports to shift toward high value added products. 
If there is a cut in air cargo rates due to a buildup of air 
cargo carrier capacity, we should be able to see a clear upward 
trend in air cargo ratios as the domestic economy improves.

  2. Regional Trends in Air Cargo 
  Exports 
  Of the $11.02 billion in exports shipped as air cargo in 
1980, the largest dollar amount went to the United States (29.4 
percent), followed by $2.67 billion to the EC (24.2 percent) 
and $2.63 billion to Asian NIE's and ASEAN countries (23.9 
percent). In 1992, the total volume of air cargo exports 
amounted to $53.8 billion, or about 4.9 times the amount in 
1980. By region, exports to Asian NIE's and ASEAN countries 
amounted to $18.84 billion (35.0 percent). This 7.2-fold 
increase over 1980 is due to an increase in exported parts to 
Asia, where Japanese enterprises are furthering local 
production, and to an increased demand in recent years for 
Japanese office equipment. Exports to Asia were more than the 
amount, $17.68 billion (35 percent) that went to the United 
States, showing the close economic ties that now exist between 
Asia and Japan (Table 29). 
  Imports 
  The largest percentage of all import from 1980 to 1992 
consistently came from the United States. EC's share has also 
increased significantly since 1986, but with the collapse of 
Japan's bubble economy and a sudden drop in luxury items 
(paintings, diamonds, etc.), import figures have been falling 
since 1991. Increased local production by Japanese enterprises 
since the latter half of the 1980's led to steady increases in 
imports from Asian NIE's and ASEAN member-countries in 1991 and 
1992. This increase was primarily in re-imported items such as 
office equipment and semiconductor and electronic parts. Looking 
at import trends in absolute dollar amounts [rather than 
percentage shares], we see that imports from the United States 
and EC countries declined in 1991 and 1992 while increasing 
steadily with regard to Asian NIE's and ASEAN countries, thus 
showing the development along the import front of horizontal 
trade between Japan's economy and these Asian countries (Table 
30).

<H5>  VI. Summary </H5>
  Behind the sharp rise in Japanese foreign direct investments 
and the furthering of local production by Japanese enterprises, 
we can see, as major factors, their response to trade friction 
and the steep rise in the yen's value during the latter half of 
the 1980's. As overseas production began, Japan's trade 
structure also began to undergo significant changes as the 
production of manufactured goods which had lost their 
price-competitiveness shifted from domestic industries to 
overseas bases. Trend has caused concern about the "hollowing 
out" of some of Japan's industries at home. A detailed 
examination of trends within specific industries, however, shows 
an aggressive effort by Japanese enterprises to shift domestic 
production in the direction of high value added manufactured 
items that do not have to be price-competitive. For example, in 
the textile and home electronics industries, high quality items 
(high value added products) are exported after being produced at 
home, while mass market items (low value added products) are 
re-imported to Japan after being made at Japanese-owned 
production plants in developing countries where labor costs are 
low. This kind of "segregation of niche," we can see, is 
developing. 
  Future exchange rates will be a factor, of course, but in 
general, we need not assume that particular industries will lose 
their competitive edge in every item they produced (from low and 
intermediate quality items to high quality items) or that there 
will be a complete hollowing out of those industries. Rather, 
the trend seems to be toward a greater differentiation of roles 
in the production field, with domestic industries specializing 
in high value added, high tech products through the development 
of innovative technology. 
  While the furthering of local production by Japanese 
enterprises is inescapable, the course will not necessarily be 
smooth sailing. It holds out many difficulties, not only in 
terms of production and production management technology but 
also in the "soft" sciences of labor and business management. In 
North America and Europe, where Japanese enterprises were 
initially motivated to move primarily in order to avoid trade 
problems, companies are having a tough time in terms of profits, 
and the situation and future direction of local production there 
warrants careful attention. In Asia, on the other hand, 
companies were motivate by the sound economic desire to seek 
cheap labor and are seeing satisfactory profits. At present, 
North America remains the most important region for Japan in 
terms of local production; but it seems only natural that, with 
the growing, future potential of the Asian market, Japanese 
enterprises will be embarking on overseas corporate strategies 
that stress the importance of Asia. Designating Asia as a 
production base not only means a production base for exports but 
also signifies Asia's transformation into a production base 
targeting local sales as regional demand expands.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rankings of 200 Leading Political </F>
Contributors and Emergency Questionnaire Survey"] 
  [Text] As the general contractor scandals have 
illustrated, adhesion between the corporate and political worlds 
has been subject to renewed criticism, and attention is focused 
on the status of corporate contributions. One wonders whether 
corporate contributions are beneficial or detrimental... Amidst 
the announcement by Keidanren [Federation of Economic 
Organizations] that it will discontinue the collection and 
management of political contributions, corporations and industry 
display mass confusion in the stance they should assume in 
relation to the political world. 
<H3>  Emergency Questionnaire Survey Reveals Lack of Principles on 
Political Contributions </H3>
  On 13 October, the Federation of Electric Power Companies 
decided to discontinue publication of advertisements in Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] organs. The reason for the decision was 
based on criticism that the advertising fees of as much as 36 
million yen per issue were tantamount to political contributions. 
  Those fees equal that charged for one-page advertisements in 
national newspapers, and criticism that they are 
disproportionate even from the standpoint of the potential 
stimulus on consumer interest are probably in order. 
  Aside from such advertisements, the flow of funds to the 
political world takes the form of purchases of tickets to 
parties and offers of office space which are almost identical to 
political contributions. Even if illegal contributions are not 
germane to this discussion, the flow of funds from corporations 
to politicians assumes a variety of forms and large sums. 
  In compiling this special feature article, this magazine 
conducted a questionnaire survey of about 80 leading 
corporations. However, the response rate was a low 27 percent. 
Since the survey covered a delicate subject, many firms 
indicated they could not respond. 
  A special feature reflected in the results of the survey was 
that most of the firms or 50 percent indicated that they made 
contributions because, "Keidanren or an industry organization 
requested contributions." In response to the question about 
method of contribution, the highest percentage, 36.4 percent, 
stated that they were made "through industry organizations," 
indicating they were significantly influenced by industry 
trends. You might consider this the manifestation of Japanese 
perceptions calling for conformity with patterns established by 
the precedent setter. 
  However, when it came to contributions to political factions 
and individual politicians, 59 percent of the firms responded 
that they were based on "independent judgments of the firms." 
This survey result reveals that individual ties between 
corporations and politicians serve as a basis for making 
decisions on contributions. 
  On Keidanren's discontinuation of collecting and managing 
contributions, 40.9 percent of respondents showed passive 
support as expressed by the words, "cannot be avoided in view of 
public opinion." Only 13.6 percent replied that the "decision 
was logical." The survey results indicate that corporations are 
quite confused by the situation emanating from the decision to 
discontinue the collection and management of political funds. 
  Concerning the government proposal to abolish corporate 
contributions in five years, 40.9 percent "favored" the idea, 
while none "opposed" the idea. Regarding Keidanren's ending its 
intermediary role, the same percentage expressed passive 
support, but they expressed positive "support" of the government 
proposal to abolish contributions. These responses probably 
reflect the situation wherein corporations feel comfortable with 
uniform prohibition against contributions, which spares them the 
need for independent decisions. 
  This phenomenon is clearly revealed in the positions taken 
relative to future contributions. 
  Of the respondents, only 13.6 percent displayed the 
clear-cut 
position that they would "discontinue contributions" to 
political parties as well as factions and individual politicians. 
  Further, 31.8 percent said they would "continue 
contributions 
to political parties based on their independent decisions," 
while 18.2 percent said they would continue such contributions 
to factions and individual politicians. Although 95.5 percent of 
firms surveyed made contributions in the past, the number of 
firms that would continue to do so, when forced to make 
independent decisions, drops significantly. 
  Of special note is that contributions to factions and 
individual politicians which are clearly reflective of corporate 
attitudes would drop to less than one-fifth of previous levels. 
  These survey results probably demonstrate the lack of 
principles in contributions made in the past. 
  And, it is the lack of principles in corporate actions that 
have become the target of public criticism. It appears the 
situation provides a rare opportunity for use of such public 
opinion as a lever in reforming corporate-political 
relationships. 
<H3>  Rankings of Contributions--Banks, General Contractors, and 
Life and Casualty Insurance Companies Are Three Leading 
Contributor Groups </H3>
  We now discuss the size of corporate and organizational 
contributions. A look at contributions made to political funding 
organizations in 1992 reveals that they totaled 9.377 billion 
yen to the LDP's Kokumin Seiji Kyokai, 774 million yen to the 
Seiwa Kyokai of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and 3.56 
million yen to the Japan New Party's support organization. 
  A breakdown reveals that the majority of contributions made 
to the Kokumin Seiji Kyokai was from banks. Banks represented 
the top 14 contributors; contributions by these 14 banks totaled 
1.16 billion yen. Separately, large regional bank contributions 
were topped by the Yokohama Bank with 23.74 million yen and 
followed by Hokuriku Bank with 16.42 million yen. 
  Additionally, the Second Regional Bank Association 
contributed 70 million yen, the Credit Associations of Japan 
contributed 45 million yen, and the Central Association of 
Credit Unions contributed 13 million yen, representing sizable 
organizational contributions and leading to total contributions 
by the banking industry of close to 2 billion yen. 
  The next sequentially significant contributors were trading 
companies and the steel industry. Among trading companies the 
leading five firms of Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Itochu, Sumitomo, and 
Marubeni each contributed 63.85 million yen. The total 
contributed by all trading companies exceeded 500 million yen. 
  In the steel industry, the five leading firms of Nippon 
Steel, NKK, Kawasaki Steel, Kobe Steel, and Sumitomo Metal 
Industries ranked down to 25th place as contributors and 
provided a total of 375 million yen. Additionally, the Japan 
Iron and Steel Federation ranked second in organizational 
contributions, donating a total of 90 million yen, representing 
an industry group making sizable contributions. 
  The Petroleum Association of Japan is the highest ranking 
industry organization contributor (donation of 91 million yen). 
It is followed by the Japan Iron and Steel Federation and Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Association (each donating 85 million 
yen) and the Japan Petrochemical Industry Association (80.51 
million yen). Of special note is that there is no relationship 
between size of the industry and size of donations. It appears 
that political donations are affected in this area by the degree 
to which government controls influence regulations and 
protective measures. 
  On the other hand, the construction industry leads in 
contributions to the Seiwa Kyokai. The top contributor is 
Shimizu (11.25 million yen), followed by Kajima (11.15 million 
yen), and Obayashi, Taisei Corp., and Takenaka Corp. (each 
donating 11.05 million yen). The fact that corporate donations 
by construction firms monopolize the top of the list probably 
attests to the hope that they will function to soften regional 
opposition movements against redevelopment projects. 
  Among organizational donations, those made by the Tokyo 
Securities Exchange Regular Members Association top the list at 
28.4 million yen. They are followed by the Japanese Dentists 
Political Federation (11 million yen) and by the Japan Iron and 
Steel Federation, Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association, 
and Japan Chemical Fibers Association (10 million each). 
  In the automobile industry, the Federation of Japan 
Automobile Workers Union supports the DSP, thus influencing the 
respective industry firms into making sizable contributions, 
including 6 million yen by Toyota, 7.3 million by Nissan, 4 
million yen by Honda, 8.2 million yen by Mazda, and 5.6 million 
yen by Mitsubishi Motors. However, it is interesting to note 
that corporate ranking and ranking of donations are not 
consistent. 
  Further, the DSP enjoys a strong base in the Tokai region to 
the extent that it is called the "Aichi DSP," but that region is 
also known for its huge textile industry. This is probably why 
contributions made by the Japan Chemical Fiber Association are 
large. 
  However, compared to contributions made to the Kokumin Seiji 
Kyokai, donations were less than one-half, graphically 
reflecting the positions of the LDP as the ruling party and the 
DSP as a perennial opposition party. 
  Further, the Japan New Party, a new organization, received 
only minimal donations, with House Food Industrial Co. leading 
the list with a donation of 6 million yen. This party can 
probably be considered as having attained extraordinary cost 
performance considering the election of 36 members to Diet seats 
with such minimal funding. 
<H3>  Casualty Insurance--Enjoys Very Subdued Standing in Terms of 
Donations </H3>
  Large contributors in the financial world initially come 
from 
the banking circles. This is especially true in the sense that 
official reports list a large number of leading banks which have 
made contributions in the 80 million yen range. It is truly a 
case where banks symbolize Japanese wealth. Memories are still 
fresh whereby banks became the topic of discussion because they 
were solicited for party donations during the last House of 
Representatives elections. 
  In comparison, the casualty insurance industry played a 
somewhat subdued role. 
  According to the Public Relations Department of the Marine 
and Fire Insurance Association of Japan chaired by Takashi 
Onoda, president of Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance Company, 
"The industry has few ties with politicians and there is no 
particular benefit in making contributions." 
  Calculations show that the average donation made by 14 
listed 
companies to the LDP was approximately 20.17 million yen. This 
figure by itself would indicate that donations were not 
necessarily low. 
  However, only the top-ranking four firms on the list donated 
more than the average amount; they were Tokio Marine and Fire at 
the top of the list, followed by Yasuda Fire and Marine, Mitsui 
Marine and Fire, and Sumitomo Marine and Fire. Overall 
impressions are altered considerably when the situation is 
viewed from this perspective. 
  Speaking of the casualty insurance industry, its influence 
within the financial world is weaker than generally thought as 
can be seen in last year's issue of reciprocal operating rights 
between life and casualty insurance industries. Needless to say, 
the priority assigned to the various firms is not determined by 
the monetary value of donations, but according to casualty 
insurance industry sources, "The industry's political influence 
is nonetheless weak." 
  An issue on which the industry is cureently placing foremost 
importance is that concerning tax deductions for insurance 
premiums. 
  In the current tax system, there is a wide variance between 
the treatment of deductions allowed for life insurance and that 
for casualty insurance. 
  Currently, deductions allowed for casualty insurance 
premiums 
are one-tenth of that for life insurance, while deductions are 
applicable to only half as many individuals, but the government 
is being asked to shrink the differences in connection with next 
fiscal year's revisions to the tax system. 
  The previously quoted sources admit to the difficulties 
being 
faced as they say, "We have expressed our desires in connection 
with deductions allowed for insurance premiums, but such 
circumstances pose difficulties for the attainment of our goals." 
  In any event, the future will no doubt see a major change in 
the status of political donations. 
  When that happens, industry itself will face a genuine test 
of its influence. It will be interesting to note whether the 
casualty insurance industry can exercise its influence at that 
time. 
<H3>  Transportation--Next Year Will Call for a Review Including 
the Idea of Zero Donations </H3>
  Let's take a look at the transportation industry. The 
industry is divided primarily into the land, marine, and air 
sectors and policies concerning political donations appear to 
differ for each sector. 
  Let us base our discussion on data contained in government 
reports. Focusing on corporations and organizations that 
officially donated comparatively large sums in excess of 10 
million yen to the LDP through its conduit, the Kokumin Seiji 
Kyokai, during 1992, shows that, in the land sector, all 15 
leading private railway firms donated sums in excess of that 
figure. In this connection, we find that the largest sum of 
about 46.43 million yen was donated by the Kinki Nippon Railway 
and that the smallest sum donated was about 11 million yen by 
the Nishi-Nippon Railroad Company. The 15 firms donated a total 
of about 350 million yen for a per company average of about 
23.37 million yen. Although it can be said that the sums are 
comparatively small compared to banks and steel firms, these 
figures consider only those sums donated by "parent firms"; 
including figures for affiliated companies would obviously make 
the totals higher. You might say a special characteristic of 
these figures is that they do not include any donations from the 
Japan Private Railway Conference chaired by Moritoshi Serizawa, 
chairman of the Keihin Electric Express Railway Company. 
  Railway industry sources have expressed their views on 
political donations by the industry in this manner: "The railway 
industry has concluded that any political donations are made 
strictly as a matter of `social obligation.' We do not 
understand the position taken by other industries, but it would 
be stupid of us to think that we could increase railway usage by 
making donations to politicians and political parties. In the 
Meiji era, it may have been logical to think that we could 
establish new rail routes and expand rail operations through the 
influence of politicians, but the reverse situation prevails 
under current conditions wherein the government looks for 
railways, as `public transportation agencies,' to increase their 
passenger capacities." 
  However, another viewpoint expressed by an unspecified, but 
informed source and which should not be overlooked says, 
"Railway companies can no longer survive solely on the basis of 
revenue earned through rail operations. They are in the process 
of expanding their revenue sources through operations related to 
real estate, distribution, and leisure enterprises. They can 
probably dismiss the value of political donations from a pure 
rail operation perspective, but when viewed from the aspect of 
residential development and leisure facilities projects, it is 
questionable whether they can afford to take the same position." 
  On the other hand, what is the status of the "air" sector? 
The three leading firms of this sector are not on the official 
government list. According to a source at an unspecified airline 
company, the situation in the industry is such that, "The 
airline industry faces a crisis situation. The industry is in no 
position to make political donations." 
  Next, what is the status of political donations by the 
"marine" sector? The marine transportation industry can be 
categorized into the "international marine" sector handled by 
the so-called five leading firms and the "domestic marine" 
sector handled by the domestic marine transportation industry, 
but this discussion will focus on the international marine 
sector. 
  In the case of the international marine transportation 
sector, there is no case in which an individual firm has made an 
independent donation. However, the "Japan Ship Owners' 
Association" industry organization, chaired by Susumu Tenporin, 
president of Mitsui OSK Lines, has contributed 33 million yen to 
the Kokumin Seiji Kyokai. 
  One employee of an unnamed marine shipping company comments, 
"The reason individual firms in our industry do not make 
political donations is that they are restricted by `interest 
subsidy provisions.' The official title of the code is the 
`Emergency Measures Law Concerning Subsidized Interest for Loans 
To Construct Seagoing Vessels.' This system was used from 1979 
through 1982 when seagoing vessels were ordered and built with 
huge outlays of public subsidies. The system is not used today, 
but the logic applied is that `companies that have received 
subsidies from the government cannot afford to make political 
donations.'" 
  Then, there is the question of what reason is used when the 
Japan Ship Owners' Association makes a donation? Sources at the 
association point out that "donations are made to the LDP purely 
for the sake of supporting a political party that promotes 
freedom and free trade." 
  Another source states, "Donations in 1992 rose to 33 million 
yen, but they reflect a one-time increase because a House of 
Councilors election was held that year. For the past several 
years donations have been about 22 million yen, some 10 million 
yen less. 
  The same source continues, "It appears the association is 
moving to consider changes, including a zero donation level, 
based on progress being made on various reforms, including the 
Political Funding Control Law being studied by the government." 
  The above represents a quick review of donations by the 
transportation industry, but it appears the industry as a whole 
shows strong signs of "making changes next year." 
<H3>  Energy Industry--Flustered in a Major Way by Criticism of 
Disproportionate "Advertising Costs" </H3>
  The Federation of Electric Power Companies, composed of nine 
power companies and chaired by Kohei Abe of Chubu Electric Power 
Co., has continued political donations to the LDP in the form of 
"advertising fees" which are facing renewed challenge as a 
practice of a public utility. 
  On 13 October, as Chairman Abe addressed an emergency press 
conference, he said, "We have invited the misunderstanding that 
the advertising fees were political donations," and explained 
that future advertisements would be discontinued, but he avoided 
any clarification of whether the expenditures were "advertising 
fees" or "donations." 
  The recently criticized advertising fees paid to the LDP 
reached the huge sum of 1 billion yen in fiscal year 1992 alone. 
The federation's annual advertising budget totals about 5 
billion yen, so this means that about one-fifth of the amount 
budgeted was being funneled into the LDP. The advertisements 
were printed in three LDP publications: JIYU SHIMPO, RIBURU, and 
GEKKAN JIYU MINSHU. 
  However, those advertising fees are extraordinarily high in 
relation to the limited circulation of these organ publications 
and for this reason criticism was levied that, "The sums 
involved were political donations disguised as advertising fees." 
  Initially, when the federation was criticized, it insisted 
that the fees involved "advertising," saying, "We announced the 
electric power industry's position concerning nuclear power 
generation in the form of an advertisement," but if one 
considers the medium used versus the fees involved, it is only 
logical that they are viewed as political donations. 
  To begin with, there was a reason why an influential basic 
industry such as the electric power industry could not openly 
make political donations. 
  The reason relates to the fact that the industry was faced 
with a consumer "movement to refuse to pay even 1 yen of the 
portion of rate hikes that represented political donations" as a 
reaction to an industry-wide rate hike that went into effect in 
1974 immediately following the first oil shock. 
  At that time, the federation took the situation seriously 
and 
decided that donations by individual firms would be abolished 
and that donations would be limited to those made by individual 
federation officials. 
  It is said that this policy is still followed, but even 
after 
it was decided to abolish donations by individual firms after 
1974 because of the series of scandals, the view persists that 
"donations" were made in a different form. 
  Citing a lack of records, the federation has not made any 
revelations for the period before 1983, but it explains that 
advertising fees paid to the LDP in 1983 totaled 350 million yen 
and rose yearly thereafter until they reached 1 billion yen in 
the last fiscal year. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], 
which is responsible for supervising this area, has said that 
"it is questionable whether sums paid as an industry 
organization responsible for operating public utilities 
enterprises were appropriate." 
  On the other hand, the Japan Gas Association, a public 
utility organization chaired by Hiroshi Watanabe, chairman of 
Tokyo Gas Company, has been questioned on the propriety of its 
advertisements placed with the LDP organs via the Economic 
Publicity Center, an external organization of Keidanren. 
  The Japan Gas Association in the last fiscal year paid 273 
million yen in political party fees and 237 million yen of that 
amount went directly for fees to cover advertisements placed in 
LDP publications such as JIYU SHIMPO. 
  Industry sources have expressed the view, "If the foregoing 
use of funds was prearranged by the gas association, the 
Economic Publicity Center, and the LDP, the situation would pose 
a serious problem. It would be very obvious that an attempt was 
made to camouflage a political donation. However, the views of 
the gas association and the Economic Publicity Center are 
diametrically apart on that point. It appears the two parties do 
not have the freedom to come to an easy agreement." 
  Chairman Watanabe of the gas association views the situation 
seriously, saying, "It is true that there are suspicions that 
the fees constitute political donations. We should take 
corrective action to ensure that misunderstandings are not 
inspired concerning us as public utilities businesses," 
suggesting that such donations will be discontinued. 
  Electric power and gas industries which were recently 
criticized for political donation scandals had once made large 
political donations similar to those of the steel and banking 
industries. However, such donations were supposed to have been 
abolished from the standpoint that they would involve public 
utilities. 
  However, now that it is known that huge sums of funds which 
were virtually donations had been funneled to political parties, 
it is only natural that they are treated as a problem. Moreover, 
the fact that both industries announced the intent to abolish 
such donations as soon as the problem surfaced seems to indicate 
that they do feel a modicum degree of guilt. 
<H3>  Machinery--Ostensibly the Purpose Is To Pay for Party 
Tickets, But What Is the Real Under-the-Table Purpose? </H3>
  The public relations official of the Japan Machine Tools 
Builders Association [JMTBA] which is chaired by Goro Tejima, 
president of Hitachi Seiki Co., appeared as if he could not 
believe the figure quoted to him for political donations by that 
organization, saying, "Do they reach such high figures? Our 
association is not supposed to have that kind of money." 
  Donations made to the Kokumin Seiji Kyokai by JMTBA in 
fiscal 
year 1992 under the provisions of the Political Funds Control 
Law totaled 9.09 million yen. That is probably a large sum for 
JMTBA, which has an annual budget of about 300 billion yen. 
  The JMTBA maintains no program of collecting donations from 
individual firms. 
  However, when a party is held to raise political funds under 
the title of "party in support of Mr. So-and-So," there are 
occasions when they purchase party tickets. 
  Most of those tickets were sold by Diet men who were former 
officials of MITI, which exercised jurisdiction over the machine 
tool builders' industry. 
  Moreover, the public affairs official states that residual 
fiscal yearend funds serve as the principal source of funding 
for such purchases and that, "We do not budget specifically for 
political donations." 
  JMTBA revenues going into its general accounts consist 
primarily of association fees paid by member firms. That fee is 
determined by a formula which is applied against a firm's prior 
fiscal year revenues. That amount is fairly flexible, and as an 
example, since last year was a recessionary one, fees collected 
this year were about two-thirds of that collected last year. 
  It was apparently a case where it was thought that yearend 
availability for political funding could not have been so large 
in government reports for 1992 under the JMTBA system where 
fiscal yearend residuals are used to buy party tickets. This 
accounts for the statement quoted at the beginning of this 
section. 
  The rate of new orders for the machine tool industry 
continues to experience lags. Although the world is faced with 
the collapse of the cold war structure and a new political 
situation on the domestic front, the industry probably truly 
hopes for an early recovery of the economy. 
  On the other hand, the machine tools industry, much like 
industries such as the construction sector, has "money that does 
not appear on the surface." Certain industry sources point to 
the existence of money known as "funds disbursed during election 
campaigns." These are funds that are not reported under the 
Political Funds Control Law and that are funneled through 
confidential channels. 
  Any debate on political reform leads to the argument that 
the 
Political Funds Control Law leaks like a sieve in terms of 
effectiveness, and unless both politicians and corporations are 
determined to conduct themselves honestly, there will be no 
value in revising laws. 
<H3>  Food Industry--Paucity of Donations Reflects Condition of 
Industry </H3>
  A public relations official of a food maker stated, 
"Regulations and advantages of making donations do not prevail 
in the food industry as they do in other industries. That is why 
donations are made purely on an obligatory basis." 
  That statement appears to be correct, viewed from the report 
issued by the Ministry of Finance for 1992. 
  The top donation was made by Kirin Brewery in the amount of 
43.4 million yen, but this was a fairly unique figure. Among 
other high-volume breweries, there was Sapporo Brewery donating 
17.56 million yen and Asahi Brewery donating 17.5 million yen 
which were appropriate levels for those two, but no other food 
makers donated more than 10 million yen as an individual firm. 
  In comparison to the banking industry, where one bank is 
known to have donated over 80 million yen, the food industry as 
a whole barely exceeds the donations of a single bank. 
  As stated at the outset of this section, the first reason is 
that there are few issues relating to the food industry where 
donations can be used to lobby effectively for political action. 
Another reason that can be cited is that food companies are 
comparatively small relative to their widespread name 
recognition. 
  And, as pointed out by one food company president, 
"Activities of food companies in the industrial world were 
limited in the past, leaving it with only a nominal status," 
thus placing them in a position where they could not make 
donations aggressively. 
  Several donations did garner some attention. Among them was 
the donation by SB Foods to Shintaro Ishihara as an individual. 
  About that donation, a public affairs official of the firm 
notes that, "We made the donation because Mr. Ishihara serves as 
a consultant to the "SB Sports Club," a children's cultural 
group that we operate. 
  And, among the few firms donating to the Japan New Party is 
the House Food Industrial Company. 
  Further, although a variety of industry organizations 
represent the food industry, very few are mentioned on the 
official donation lists. They say that the Japan Soy Sauce 
Association has contributed to the LDP, but they do not assume a 
positive stance admitting, "We appear to be making donations 
reluctantly because they persistently approach us for donations, 
but we'd like to discontinue them if at all possible." 
  Among firms that replied to the data-gathering effort, many 
of them expressed a desire to discontinue donations in the 
future. 
<H3>  Precision Tools Industry--Erstwhile Glamour Industry Has 
Faded into the Past </H3>
  The Japan Camera Industry Association [JCIA], chaired by 
Hideo Tajima, chairman of Minolta Camera, made contributions 
totaling 14 million yen in 1992 to the Kokumin Seiji Kyokai and 
the Seiwa Kyokai. 
  Those donations were made collectively by the industry 
organization in response to the desire of industry circles that 
they preferred such an approach over individual donations by the 
respective firms. 
  This is not a case where the JCIA levies donations from the 
respective firms, but one in which firms that wish to do so make 
voluntary donations which are collected for use in making 
consolidated contributions. 
  Since contributions are not mandatory, there are firms that 
make independent donations. 
  The JCIA collects donations from the respective firms based 
on the approximate revenues of each firm. 
  Further, methods for collecting donations and timing are 
determined on the basis of economic conditions and operating 
status of individual firms. 
  This year, because of political changes, including the 
collapse of one-party rule by the LDP and the birth of the 
coalition government, and suspicions cast on covert 
relationships between politicians and business because of the 
general contractor scandals, the JCIA maintains that it is not 
in a position to aggressively pursue prospects for collecting 
and managing donations. 
  Notwithstanding, donations of 14 million yen are not 
necessarily a small amount. 
  As reason for collecting and managing donations in the past, 
the JCIA cites "membership in Keidanren." 
  In other words, this is not a case where donations were 
collected to support a specific political party or candidate, 
but to support the "great cause" of freedom, in accordance with 
the goals of Keidanren. 
  However, as stated previously, since the organization is not 
sure about what it will do in relation to this year's 
contributions, it states about future donations, "We will 
consider each donation on a case-by-case basis, since we cannot 
predict future political situations." 
  As the cold war structure has collapsed and political 
restructuring in the domestic arena is still fluid, this is a 
case where potential beneficiaries of political donations and 
the reasons for donations cannot be clearly established. 
  However, the impact of having reached market saturation 
relative to single-lens reflex cameras and the sharp rise in the 
value of the yen, according to industry sources, have caused a 
"deterioration in market conditions" and the industry is 
probably in no condition to make major donations.

  [Text] Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara has 
firmed up his intention to resign as early as late February 
after the draft budget for fiscal 1994 is submitted to the 
ordinary Diet. The most powerful candidate as his successor is 
believed to be 60-year-old Tadashi Tsuda, former administrative 
vice minister of Home Affairs and current chairman of the 
Association for Promoting Internationalization of Local 
Governments, several government sources said on 29 January. 
  Ishihara took his post when former Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita came to power in November 1987. Since then, he has 
been in office over six years and two months, making his term 
the longest one compared with those of successive chief cabinet 
secretaries. He once showed his intention to resign when the 
coalition cabinet was established. However, persuaded by Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Ishikawa has decided to resign 
hopefully after the political reform bills are enacted. 
  Strong candidate Tsuda joined the Ministry of Home Affairs 
in 
1955 and served as the administrative vice minister from June 
1989 to July 1990.

  [Text] Speaking at a New Year exchange of greetings 
gathering which was held on 31 January at the headquarters of 
the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] with the House of 
Councilors members affiliated with the LDP attending, LDP 
President Yohei Kono touched on how the Diet should be run in 
the future and said, "It has become apparent that the Hosokawa 
government cannot do any major work without the LDP's 
cooperation." In this way, the LDP president warned the 
government and ruling coalition parties against taking one-sided 
actions. The LDP president made the statement taking into 
account the history of enacting a package of political reform 
bills in the Diet. At the gathering, Mr. Kono also stressed: "A 
shift in policy and a decision on policy hinges on whether the 
LDP agrees or not." In this way, he predicted that the LDP's 
cooperation will be indispensable for the Hosokawa government to 
accomplish its major policy tasks. 
  Recalling the past battle between the ruling and opposition 
parties over the political reform, Mr. Kono said: "The 
Hosokawa-style political reform and the LDP-style political 
reform vied with each other, but our party's political reform 
triumphed."

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] A draft guideline, set by the ruling coalition 
parties, for the fiscal 1994 budget, came to light on 31 
January. In response to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of 
GATT, the draft guideline cites projects for upgrading the 
current agricultural foundation to protect Japanese farmers as 
the centerpiece of the budget for fiscal 1994. The draft 
guideline also calls for the need to strengthen the management 
foundation for small-and medium-sized enterprises and take 
measures for economic recovery, revitalize land transactions, 
and construct houses. The draft guideline does not touch on the 
purchase of Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft 
and the construction of new bullet-train railroads for which a 
coordination of views is continuing within the ruling coalition 
parties. What is noteworthy in the draft guideline is that it 
calls for reforming the current tender system and drawing up a 
basic plan for environment, thus revealing that the ruling 
coalition parties, which came to power following a change of 
government, intend to compile their first budget their own way. 
  The ruling coalition parties plan to ask the Policy 
Secretary 
Council to further discuss details of the draft guideline and to 
formally adopt it as a "guideline for the compilation of the 
budget for fiscal 1994" on 8 February after obtaining an 
endorsement at a meeting of representatives from the ruling 
coalition parties. 
  The draft guideline explicitly points out the need to 
aggressively promote the upgrading of the agricultural 
foundation in line with the "new agricultural policy," saying, 
"In 1994, it is necessary to take as many emergency measures as 
possible for agriculture." The draft guideline calls for 
creating a new loan system to extend long-term loans to be used 
for the management and operation of farming and for introducing 
a new formula to promote the effective utilization of farm lands 
for would-be farmers. 
  The centerpiece of stimulus measures in the draft guideline 
is the revitalization of land and housing transactions. To that 
end, the draft guideline calls for: 1) adopting a "public 
housing lease system for special loans" to promote the payment 
in advance for the lease of corporation-built housing; 2) 
creating a new system like the Town-Building Loan System by the 
Housing Loan Corporation; and 3) expanding the public 
announcement places of land prices. In this way, the draft 
guideline gives consideration to the fairness of land and 
housing transactions to prevent a recurrence of the bubble 
economy. 
  As for the defense budget, the draft guideline says: 
"Efforts 
should be made to build an efficient and moderate defense power 
under the Medium-Term Defense Buildup Plan which has been 
revised so as to curb defense budget spending." Regarding the 
AWACS whose purchase is facing vehement opposition from the 
ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan, the draft guideline 
avoids mentioning it. As for a plan to review the plans to 
construct new bullet-train railroads which has become a future 
task for the meeting of representatives from the ruling 
coalition parties and ministries and agencies involved to 
coordinate their views, the draft guideline hints at the 
possibility of increasing the planned three railroads and five 
rail blocks, saying, "It is necessary to continue the promotion 
of preparations for the construction of new bullet-train 
railroads." The draft guideline, however, does not specifically 
indicate the names of areas where the railroads will be 
constructed and the question of securing necessary financial 
resources. As for the administrative reform, deregulation, 
decentralization that Prime Minister Hosokawa has publicly 
promised the people, the draft guideline calls for an early 
implementation of decentralization and the streamlining of 
subsidies from the national treasury to local autonomous 
governments.

  [Text] Now that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono have agreed on a 
revision of the political reform bills, the government is 
expected to announce an economic stimulus package sometime 
between 2 and 4 February. The ruling parties will hold a 
meeting of representatives to deal with the question of reducing 
income and resident taxes -- the topic of most concern to all -- 
and will also discuss whether to raise the consumption tax rate 
in return. The outline of the 1994 taxation system reform plan 
will be finalized 8 February. The Finance Ministry's budget 
draft for 1994 is expected to be finished 10 February, and to 
become the government budget draft on 15 February. The 
government plan is to deal with all pending economic issues by 
the 11 February Japanese-U.S. summit. 
  The overall economic package is made up primarily of 
additional public works projects, increased purchase of 
public-use land in advance, and assistance to housing 
construction and small and medium businesses. Public 
investments and loans for these projects are predicted to come 
to almost 9 trillion yen. Detailed plans will be worked out on 
them henceforth. 
  The reduction of taxes will probably come in the scale of 
6-7 
trillion yen as a way of promoting consumption, and it is likely 
that even if the related bills on the measure are passed in 
summer, they will become effective retroactive to January. Once 
the Diet formally enacts the political reform bills, the 
representatives of coalition parties will enter in-depth 
discussions on the question of raising the consumption tax as a 
source of budget revenue. As the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] is opposed to the concept, there is bound to be 
tough negotiations with the Finance Ministry, which insists on 
specifying the raising of taxes as a revenue resource. 
  After the representatives' meeting, if they decide to 
entrust 
the prime minister with making a decision, the prime minister 
will make a decision on such points as the scale of the tax 
reductions and the time lag between the reduction of the income 
and residents tax and the raising of the consumption tax. 
  The government is likely to hold a Cabinet meeting to decide 
on the overall economic stimulus package some time between 2 and 
4 February. It will formulate and submit to the Diet the 1993 
supplementary budget to implement the stimulus measures by 
mid-February. 
  In the meantime, the contents of the 1994 taxation system 
reform plan will also be finalized, and all ministries and 
agencies will negotiate with the Finance Ministry on the scale 
of their budgets, including defense expenses and official 
development assistance in expenditures. Because of difficult 
financial conditions, the budget scale will be contained as much 
as possible, while expenses allocated to public works will be 
raised to rev up the economy.

"Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series; part two of a 
three-part series of articles on the Labor Ministry: 
"Ministry's Leadership Questioned"] 
  [Editorial Report] Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 
carries on page five of its 17 January Morning Edition a 
2,100-character article by economic reporter Yasuhiro Suzuki as 
the second installment of a three-part series on the Labor 
Ministry in its "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series. 
  The article reports that despite Labor Minister Chikara 
Sakaguchi's fury at the Economic Planning Agency's [EPA] 7 
January report, entitled "Overwork and Health Hazards," which 
indirectly criticizes the Labor Ministry's failure to implement 
adequate measures to reduce working hours, the ministry chose 
not to protest to the EPA for fear of rekindling a controversy 
between labor and management on the issue. 
  Suzuki writes that the cornerstone of the Labor Ministry's 
postwar labor policy is to maintain political neutrality between 
labor and management, although, admittedly, the labor minister 
sometimes works behind the scenes to bring about agreement 
between the two sides during the spring labor offensives. As a 
result, spring offensives over the years have always agreed on a 
wage level commensurate to obtaining economic conditions. 
  However, Suzuki observes that under the current coalition 
government, labor has gained more influence -- for instance, a 
rule limiting weekly working hours to 46 was passed in December 
despite protests from management. Moreover, with the present 
pressing labor issues, such as unemployment and reduced working 
hours amid the economic recession, the Labor Ministry's stance 
of complete political neutrality is now being questioned. The 
ministry is now being asked to exercise leadership in labor 
issues, which it hesitates to do for fear of provoking the 
promanagement Liberal Democratic Party.

<F P=106> [By Tokyo office economic reporter Yasuhiro Suzuki; from the </F>
"Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series; part three of a 
three-part series of articles on the Labor Ministry: "Ever 
Present `Sectarian Interest' Mentality"] 
  [Editorial Report] Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 
carries on page five of its 24 January Morning Edition a 
1,500-character article by economic reporter Yasuhiro Suzuki as 
the third and last installment of a three-part series on the 
Labor Ministry in its "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series. 
  The article first reports that the Labor Ministry Women's 
Bureau used to be the symbol of improvement of women's social 
status because the bureau was the first to hire women as senior 
officials, and many women from this bureau eventually became 
Diet members, or even Cabinet ministers. Therefore, it prides 
itself as the sole authority on policy on women. 
  However, last year, Mariko Bando, who had climbed the 
bureaucratic ladder in the Prime Minister's Office throughout 
her career, was appointed the ninth chief of the Women's Affairs 
Office under the Prime Minister's Office, an organization 
created in 1975 for the UN Year of the Women. All eight of her 
predecessors came from the Labor Ministry Women's Bureau. This 
led to angry demands from the Women's Bureau for a clear 
delineation of functions, even resulting in a written agreement 
between the two rival offices. The bureau's strong opposition 
also defeated the Prime Minister's Office's original plan to 
upgrade the Women's Affairs Office to a division. 
  Suzuki writes that many instances of bureaucratic rivalry 
have also been reported between the Labor Standards and 
Employment Security Bureaus in labor administration, giving rise 
to criticisms not only within the ministry, but also from the 
labor and management groups. 
  The article goes on to relate that sectarian jealousies at 
the Labor Ministry also affect its local offices. Compared to 
other ministries, the ministry has the most local branches, but 
these local offices all have separate vertical command 
structures divided according to bureaus. While there had been 
efforts to consolidate the command structure in the early 
eighties, after the Second Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative 
Reform made a recommendation, these efforts failed in the face 
of strong opposition from the various bureaus desperate to 
protect their vested interests. 
  Suzuki also points out that Diet members are reluctant to 
work on labor policy because this is an area not directly 
connected with money or votes. Therefore, labor issues 
zoku-giin [Diet members with special interests in specific 
policy areas] are practically nonexistent. Consequently, it is 
particularly difficult for the Labor Ministry to have its 
proposed legislations passed in the Diet. 
  The ministry is also characterized by a serious lack of 
reemployment posts for its retired bureaucrats, unlike other 
more profitable ministries with a considerable number of 
semigovernment organizations under their jurisdiction. 
Moreover, in recent years, more people tend to find jobs 
through privately published job information magazines rather 
than through the Public Employment Security Offices nationwide, 
the operation of which is one of the Labor Ministry's major 
functions. On the whole, the ministry is portrayed to be in the 
grip of a serious lack of self-confidence, and suffering from 
debilitating sectarian infighting.

<F P=106> [Article by science and technology reporter Kazuteru </F>
Yoshikawa, from the "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series, on 
the Science and Technolgy Agency: "Problem With Policy on Atomic 
Energy"] 
  [Excerpt] Hearing with 'Fairness' in Mind [subhead] 
  On the morning of 3 December, Satsuki Eda, director general 
of the Science and Technology Agency [STA] who heads the Atomic 
Energy Commission [AEC], members of the AEC including Deputy 
Chairman Akira Oyama, Shoichiro Kobayashi, chairman of Kansai 
Electric Power Company, and Hiroto Ishida, director of the STA 
Atomic Energy Bureau, were gathered at a hotel in Tokyo. The 
occasion was to hold an "open hearing" on the atomic energy 
policy, and this was the first such experience for the 
commission. 
  The purpose of holding the open hearing was for the 
commission to listen to views from extensive sectors of the 
people including those who are opposed to the use of atomic 
energy, and thus to take wide-ranging views into the long-term 
programs which will become the foundation for the nation's 
atomic energy policy. The commission took caution to be "fair" 
by having a preparatory committee -- consisting of academics and 
specialists -- select the representatives to speak in the 
hearing. 
  The open hearing was held in acceptance of critical voices 
charging that the STA's "policies on atomic energy tend to be 
decided through maneuverings of officials behind the scenes." 
Director General Eda, since he was named to the post in August, 
has emphasized he will conduct "open atomic energy 
administration," and is known to have "instructed the officials 
to make open discussions possible." 
  What brought a change to the STA's atomic energy 
administration was the uproar over the shipment of plutonium in 
January 1993. When plutonimum was shipped in from France, the 
government tried to treat it as a secret, and hide, information 
on the navigation plan and timetable of the plutonimum carrier 
on the grounds of "needs to assure security" for it. But this 
caused complaints not only from antinuclear groups but also from 
the countries, waters of which the transport ship had to pass 
through. Plutonium is a substance extracted from spent fuel in 
atomic power stations, and the government thinks the substance 
will prove to be a long-term energy resource of dependable 
supply. But the uproar over the plutonium shipment in January 
was something that betrayed the government's expectations very 
much, and the incident has since turned into an issue which is 
likely to impact the fundamentals of the atomic energy 
administration of Japan. 
  That being the case, it can be said that a key to the 
success 
of future atomic enegy administration lies not only in whether 
the safety of atomic energy and plutonium can or cannot be 
assured but also in how well the government's intention to use 
it peacefully can be understood by the people of the nation and 
other countries. It was for this reason that Japan came to 
present its own proposal on international control of plutonium 
in September -- in beginning of the work to build up the 
atmosphere of the international community toward accepting 
peaceful use of the substance. 
  The allocation for atomic power projects in the STA budget 
is 
whopping, holding 55.6 percent of the total (in 1993) -- way 
over 27 percent assigned to space projects. The AEC's stand of 
rejecting "interferences" by any other offices has been a target 
of criticism. From the first day of its birth, the AEC has been 
chided as "a commission practicing Monroeism." Of course, 
Ishida, director of the agency's Atomic Energy Bureau, himself 
insists "Monroeism is no longer here." 
<H5>  In Charge of Science-Related Budget </H5>
  Lately, what has been growing in the agency is the work of 
coordinating policies on science and technology. The agency is 
acting as the government's traffic cop on research and 
development projects initiated by ministries and agencies under 
their jurisdiction. It is also helping in preparing the 
groundwork for research efforts and training personnel. 
  The STA holds legal power to regulate policies with regard 
to 
making estimates on science and technology-related expenses of 
the entire government. As such, it has the right to check the 
contents of budget demands of the government offices, but it 
does not try to exercise the right. A senior official of the STA 
Secretariat explained: "We do not want to invite complaints from 
other government offices by exercising the regulatory right. 
After all, their increases in science and technology budget 
contribute to promoting interests of the STA." 
  What the STA considers important is the Science and 
Technology Conference (chaired by Prime Minister Hosokwa) in 
which the STA and the Ministry of Education jointly serve as the 
secretariat. The conference is attended by ministers of science 
and technology-related offices. Projects supported by the 
conference are as good as having been approved by the government 
in fact. Preparing groundwork at the conference is important, 
and the conference is the arena where the STA carries out its 
function as a regulatory office. 
  One new task facing the STA is the preparation of the 
foundation for research projects that transcend borders of 
government offices. Kinju Atarashi, director of the agency's 
Science and Technology Promotion Bureau, said a "symbolic 
project" is the intra-ministry research information network 
being considered as a new project of 1994. Its aim is to 
connect the research information networks of all ministries and 
agencies, and to put the STA in charge of making budget demands 
on it. [passage on other functions of the agency omitted]

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] revealed on 26 January that it is, in effect, cancelling 
the project to develop the next-generation medium passenger 
airplane (YXX) which was being worked on jointly by Japanese 
airplane makers and the U.S. Boeing company. This follows 
Boeing's decision not to use the YXX (called the 7J7 by Boeing) 
to replace the current Boeing 737. The decision meant, in 
effect, that even if the YXX was developed, sales would never be 
enough to make it economical. 
  As a result, Japan's aircraft development plans will shrink 
to one, the next-generation small passenger plane (YSX). The 
MITI and the Japanese aircraft makers will hold negotiations 
with foreign makers, including Boeing, Saab-Scania of Sweden, 
and Aviation Industries of China, to select a partner this year 
to share development costs of the YSX. 
  Japanese heavy industrial companies and Boeing conducted 
market research for the YXX, which was to be a medium passenger 
aircraft capable of carrying 150 passengers. However, last fall 
Boeing unilaterally decided to give priority to remodeling the 
Boeing 737 as the 737-X and using it to replace its existing 
Boeing 737 because this option was than development of the YXX. 
  As a result, the MITI and Japanese aircraft makers have 
decided to withdraw from the development project, concluding 
that if Japan tried to go it alone the YXX would be more 
expensive than the Boeing 737-X. The Japanese partners in the 
project are expected to withdraw from the project some time this 
year after consulting Boeing. The MITI is now shifting its 
attention from development of the YXX to development of the YSX. 
In formulating its budget for next year, the MITI will ask the 
Ministry of Finance to allocate only 500 million yen to the YXX 
project -- for payment of interest on the past development costs 
-- but to allocate 1.6 billion yen, 16 times the YSX development 
project received this year. 
  Japan has not developed any civil passenger aircraft since 
the "YS-11." The MITI wants to do everything to develop the 
genuinely Japanese-made YSX as a replacement for the "YS-11" in 
order to help defend Japan's aviation industry technology. It 
is hoped to use the YSX on domestic routes, the so-called "niche 
market," in which there is no competition from aircraft made by 
European and U.S. manufacturers.

  [Text] In the negotiations on automobiles and auto parts in 
the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, there is now a 
proposal for Japanese automakers to submit yearly plans 
itemizing their purchase of U.S.-made parts. Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] officials have started 
sounding out automobile companies about whether such a proposal 
would be acceptable. The MITI does not consider this to be a 
numerical target. It will also ask the U.S. auto industry to 
present export plans to break the deadlock in the framework 
talks. However, some Japanese automakers have already indicated 
opposition to this idea, believing that it will, in fact, amount 
to a numerical target. 
  When former President George Bush visited Japan in January 
1992, Japanese automakers had formulated their voluntary plan to 
import $19 billion worth of U.S.-made auto parts in fiscal year 
1994. Because this purchase plan was eventually incorporated 
into the action program announced by the Japanese and U.S. 
Governments, the United States regards the purchase plan as an 
"official commitment of the Japanese Government" and demands it 
be fulfilled. It is also asking for an extension of the 
purchase plan in the framework talks. 
  The most likely proposal being considered for the new 
purchase plans asks each automaker to issue a yearly plan 
stating not only the procurement volume but also specific items 
to be purchased -- for instance, electrical equipment. The 
Japanese companies will provide this information to the U.S. 
automobile industry voluntarily. The agreement to be reached at 
the framework talks on this will not include the amount of money 
involved in these purchase plans, on the premise that the 
governments of both countries are not directly involved. It is 
believed that this way, MITI will be able to argue that it is 
not a numerical target. 
  The framework talks have been stalled on the issue of the 
objective criteria to gauge the participation of foreign 
companies in the market. The Japanese Government has insisted 
that it is opposed to criteria involving numerical targets, such 
as amounts of money and future market shares. MITI would like 
to urge the U.S. Government to compromise by proposing this plan 
for automobile companies to present their parts purchase plans 
voluntarily, and to avoid making the proposed objective criteria 
-- such as the number of imported finished cars and the number 
of dealers of imported cars -- numerical targets. On the other 
hand, it will also ask the U.S. automobile industry to present 
export plans itemizing products that they can export to Japan.

  [Text] Regarding negotiations in the automobiles and auto 
parts sector in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, the 
Japanese Government will propose to visiting U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor the creation of a third-party organ 
to gauge the degree of foreign companies' participation in the 
Japanese market based on the objective criteria to be set. 
Japan believes that because an assessment in relation to the 
objective criteria at the governmental level is expected to give 
rise to confrontation, it is necessary to set up a neutral 
arbitration body. However, negotiations on these criteria to 
guide the third-party organ are also expected to experience 
rough sailing because the United States wants to include virtual 
numerical targets in the objective criteria. 
  The proposed third-party organ will assess the openness of 
the market based on the objective criteria to be set by both 
countries. Membership in this body will be decided later. There 
are suggestions that scholars and private companies be asked to 
belong to this organ. 
  As for the specific objective criteria, Japan proposes to 
include the following: the actual volume of Japanese imports of 
finished cars and auto parts, the number of sales outlets 
dealing in imported cars, and the number of right-hand-drive 
cars and bantam cars tailored to the needs of the Japanese 
market. The third-party organ is supposed to assess performance 
every six months based on these criteria. 
  Thus far in the framework talks negotiations, the United 
States has been persuading the Japanese automobile industry to 
set up a joint committee which will promote cooperation between 
private companies in both countries. It therefore does not 
consider the third-party organ merely a body for assessing the 
objective criteria but also expects it to act as an intermediary 
between companies. 
  According to a government source, the U.S. Government shows 
great interest in creating a third-party organ. It "has also 
expressed the desire to set up assessment bodies for areas other 
than automobiles." However, the United States wants to include 
the future percentage of increases in sales of U.S. products in 
the objective criteria and to ask the third-party organ to 
assess performance in terms of the extent to which targets have 
been met. Japan rejects this, deeming that "this will, in fact, 
amount to numerical targets." There is still a wide gap between 
the two countries' views on the role of the third-party organ.

  [Text] In preparation for the Japanese-U.S. summit talks on 
11 February, on 1 February Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
discussed the economic framework talks with Takakazu Kuriyama, 
ambassador to the United States and who is on temporary home 
leave, and listened to the views of nonlife insurers as passed 
on by Chairman Takashi Onoda of the Marine and Fire Insurance 
Association of Japan on the negotiations in the insurance sector. 
  A government source said on 1 February that U.S. President 
Bill Clinton strongly pressed for the setting of numerical 
targets in the framework talks during his telephone conversation 
with Hosokawa on 31 January and that U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR) Mickey Kantor was sent to Tokyo as a special envoy to 
make Japan implement such a demand. 
  High-ranking government officials, however, stated on 1 
February that it would be difficult to set numerical targets for 
automobiles and auto parts as the United States demands. If the 
United States sticks to its principles, it is not likely that an 
agreement can be reached at the summit talks. 
  In his briefing to the prime minister, Kuriyama said that 
while Japanese-U.S. relations are basically taking a favorable 
turn and that "the United States shows a sympathetic disposition 
toward the Hosokawa administration, it is taking a tough 
approach to the framework talks. I hope that the prime minister 
exercises leadership to conclude the talks." He stated that the 
prime minister will exercise his leadership to bring about 
progress in the framework talks. 
  After the briefing, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura and Yukio Sato, director general of the North American 
Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, joined the 
discussion on how to handle the talks. 
  In the economic framework talks, the United States is 
demanding that numerical targets be set in the priority sectors: 
automobiles and auto parts and insurance. Negotiations with 
Japan, which rejects setting such targets, have been going 
nowhere. The prime minister recently discussed with Toyota 
Motor Corporation Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda ways to break this 
deadlock, but it seems that the domestic situation is not 
conducive at all to accepting numerical targets. 
  As for automobiles and auto parts, senior government 
officials say that "Automobiles are one sector where laws and 
the administration are not deeply involved; it will be difficult 
to have numerical targets. It is a private sector." They 
reiterate their belief that it would not be possible to agree to 
the U.S. demand to set numerical targets.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Make the Most of Learning From Construction </F>
Talks To Break Deadlock Over the Framework Talks"] 
  [Text] To break the deadlock over the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks is one of the most urgent tasks for the Hosokawa 
administration. 
  The framework talks got started last fall to determine 
measures for opening Japan's auto, auto parts, medical 
equipment, and insurance markets in preparation for the 
Hosokawa-Clinton talks in February. However, the talks have long 
been stalled over characterization of criteria to measure 
achievements in Japan's open market policy. 
  The bilateral talks have great influence on the very 
foundation of Japan's trade policy. Also, the future direction 
of the nation's U.S. policy depends on development in the talks. 
We cannot accept unreasonable solutions, but neither do we 
think the bilateral discord is unsolvable. To break the 
deadlock over the framework talks, it is probably a good idea to 
make the most of the precedence of the bilateral accord on the 
construction talks. 
  Concerning the "objective criteria" to assess how the 
Japanese market is open to foreign companies, the United States 
says one of the desirable solutions is to use such figures as 
"foreign-made products' market share in other advanced 
countries." Also, it is calling for the Japanese Government's 
supervision over automakers' parts procurement plans. 
  On the other hand, Japan intends to reject the U.S. 
proposal, 
saying "we can never accept such numerical targets." Instead, 
it insists past records, such as the number of imported 
foreign-made cars and of foreign car dealers, are good enough 
for the criteria. 
  As a matter of fact, it seems Japan's standpoint is more 
reasonable. Setting target figures in individual trade fields 
is undesirable since it is what we call controlled trade. Yet, 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is 
supposed to reconsider why U.S. negotiators adhere to such an 
idea. 
  The MITI has been frequently exercising its supervisory 
authority over the business sector by setting numerical targets. 
This methodology was used in the Japan-U.S. semiconductor 
agreement. Also, the Japanese Government forced automakers to 
prepare action plans to expand imports of U.S.-made cars and 
auto parts when former U.S. President George Bush visited Japan 
in 1992. 
  Under such circumstances, the Clinton administration 
officials are wondering why Japan refuses the favor it once 
offered the former Republican administration. 
  The MITI says that is because of the bitter experience of 
the 
1991 semiconductor agreement. The bilateral agreement 
accelerated cooperation between Japanese and U.S. companies. 
However, it also resulted in the MITI's excessive intervention 
in private business. Moreover, the United States treated the 
objective figures as if they were an intergovernmental pledge of 
Japan, and threatened that the United States would impose 
sanctions if Japan failed in satisfying the objective. 
  On that ground, Japan's trade policy is leaning toward 
"GATT-centrism," rather than its conventional U.S.-oriented 
stance. 
  Japan is showing a rigid stance toward U.S. demands in view 
of the current economic situation, such as the reinforced 
competitive power of U.S.-made automobile. On the other hand, 
the Clinton administration has a strong desire for visible 
achievements in its first bilateral negotiations. Also, U.S. 
negotiators seem to believe that Japanese bureaucrats have power 
to freely manipulate the nation's economy. 
  The bilateral construction talks underwent rough sailing, 
but 
were settled by a Japanese decision to introduce open 
competition to biddings for larger projects. The United States 
welcomed Japan's drastic measure for replacing unclear and 
unfair designated biddings with competitive biddings. Follow-up 
evaluations of achievements will be assessed every year with 
six-point criteria, including the total amount and the number of 
contracts won by foreign companies. 
  We welcome the government's action plan to review the 
procurement policy in the sense that it took the initiative in a 
drastic revision of the existing bidding system. And we hope 
the government will handle the auto and insurance talks in the 
same manner. 
  For example, the MITI may announce a decision to immediately 
discontinue questionable administrative ordinances, even though 
these includes requests for automakers' voluntary restraint of 
auto export to the United States and for the business sector's 
import expansion. We believe Japan should take a bold action to 
have the United States understand that the Japanese market is 
the same as those of the rest of the world.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to 
deliver a speech to Georgetown University in Washington on 11 
February during his visit to the United States to hold a 
Japan-U.S. summit meeting. The outline of the prime minister's 
speech was worked out on 31 January. While keeping in mind the 
passage of political reform bills through the Diet, the prime 
minister will display his attitude toward tackling domestic 
affairs from the viewpoint that "reform in domestic politics is 
indispensable for promoting diplomacy." For example, he will 
declare that the Hosokawa cabinet intends to continue to tackle 
the task of "promoting reform" as the administration's top 
priority. His speech can be described as a "Hosokawa vision" 
which indicates what Japan ought to be like to prepare for the 
21st century. In concrete terms, Prime Minister Hosokawa will 
clearly state his intention to speed up the following tasks: 1) 
securing transparency in procedures for deciding on government 
policies; and 2) changing the current economic structure to a 
consumer-oriented one. Moreover, the prime minister will call 
for building "stable and strong relations between Japan and the 
United States." He will also spell out his intention to 
strengthen the cooperative relationship between the two 
countries in view of building a new order in the Asia-Pacific 
region in the post-Cold War era. The prime minister's speech 
will last about 20 minutes. He will deliver the speech in 
English as he did at the meeting of the UN General Assembly last 
September.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] is busily 
making behind-the-scenes efforts to help China join the General 
Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at an early date. The 
agreement, which was reached at the new multilateral talks (of 
the Uruguay round) last December, was originally scheduled to be 
put into force in July 1995; however, moves to put the agreement 
into effect six months earlier than scheduled have been noted. 
Thus, when the factor of time is taken into consideration, it 
will be difficult for GATT to approve China's membership. 
  China regards its participation in GATT as an important step 
in joining the framework of economic regulations of the 
international community. And, in a bid to win membership, China 
has started making preparations. For example, it is busily 
engaged in talks on tariff cuts with various nations and in 
trying to work out a unified exchange rate for the Yuan. Once 
the agreement reached at the Uruguay round becomes effective, 
GATT will be changed into the new WTO (World Trade 
Organization). However, if China's membership is not approved 
before the WTO's inauguration, "China will be forced to start 
its membership application over again after the WTO's 
inauguration and would fall behind schedule by a wide margin in 
obtaining GATT membership," (as stated by a MOFA source). 
  The United States has proposed putting the Uruguay round 
agreement into effect six months earlier than originally 
scheduled because it believes there will be no problem in 
getting ratification from Congress. Moreover, the EU (European 
Union) intends, in principle, to agree to this proposal. China 
will hold bilateral working-level negotiations in Geneva as 
early as 20 March in a bid to win GATT membership. However, if 
the agreement should be put into effect earlier than originally 
scheduled, it is expected China will have difficulties in 
obtaining approval for membership. 
  As far as Japan is concerned, it believes: "If China's 
participation in GATT is delayed, Taiwan, which is scheduled to 
join GATT at the same time as China, will also be affected", 
(according to the same source). Therefore, Japan is concerned 
over the possibility that China and Taiwan, which now impose a 
serious influence on economic activities in East Asia, will be 
kept out of the GATT system. Japan plans to make greater 
behind-the-scenes efforts to urge European countries and the 
United States to cooperate in giving their approval -- as early 
as at the ministerial conference to sign the agreement to be 
held in Morocco in mid-April. Moreover, Japan is studying the 
possibility of indicating its stance of opposing the plan to put 
the Uruguay round agreement into effect earlier than originally 
scheduled.

  [Text] The government will start publishing the GOVERNMENT 
PROCUREMENT GAZETTE (tentative name) so as to implement 
thoroughly the open competitive bidding system in the government 
procurement system. The government intends to include this plan 
in the action program which will be worked out, it is hoped by 
early February, to improve the government procurement system. 
The government plans to issue this report also in English. In 
this way, the government hopes to meet the demand for market 
opening by making it easier for foreign companies to participate 
in government procurement bidding. 
  In this action program aimed at improving the government 
procurement system, the government, first of all, intends to 
thoroughly carry out the open competitive bidding system as 
stipulated in the Public Accounts Act. However, it is expected 
that because the amount of information to be made public before 
the bidding will probably increase drastically, it will be 
impossible for the existing official gazettes to handle such a 
huge amount of information. 
  Therefore, the GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT GAZETTE will carry 
only 
the information on government procurement for those who want to 
participate in the bidding. It is planned that the gazette will 
carry not only public announcements on the bidding but also 
other information, such as plans to introduce the open 
competitive bidding system by concerned organs, and lists of 
liaison offices. In addition to the official gazettes, a 
gazette known as the COMMERCIAL BUSINESS DAILY (CBD), which 
deals only with information on government procurement, has been 
widely circulated in the United States.

  [Text] In the wake of passage of the political reform 
bills under an agreement between the ruling and opposition 
parties, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has weathered the 
immediate crisis of a split in the party. However, the crack in 
the party caused by a confrontation between those who are eager 
to change the electoral system and those taking a cautious 
attitude cannot be repaired. At an LDP General Council meeting 
and at meetings of each faction within the party held on 29 
January, members taking a cautious stance increasingly 
criticized LDP executives and advocates of political reform for 
the agreement reached between Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP 
President Kono at their summit meeting. It is expected that LDP 
executives led by President Kono -- who attach more importance 
to the views of those eager for political reform and made the 
decision "to enact the political reform bills" -- will be forced 
to face difficulties managing the party because there is still 
the possibility of a split. Meanwhile, they will also be 
required to make efforts to promote "harmony within the party." 
  Although the agreement reached at the summit meeting was 
eventually approved by the LDP General Council, members who are 
cautious about political reform voiced their dissatisfaction 
with the agreement, saying: "Party executives should have 
listened to the opinions of other party members before reaching 
the agreement" and "if it respects the results of a House of 
Councillors vote, the party should have made the decision to 
kill the bills without fearing the people's criticism." 
  At the respective meeting of the Obuchi and Miyazawa 
factions, harsh criticism was leveled at the fact that some 
political reform advocates conducted a signature-collecting 
campaign in an attempt to have the government-proposed bills 
adopted at the Diet and to then leave the party. Hiromu Nonaka 
said: "The major factor that has led to confusion within the 
party is the fact that some advocates of political reform -- who 
were thinking about leaving the party -- hold important 
positions." Meanwhile, Katsuhiko Shirakawa said: "Some members 
said they might leave the party, thus creating a stir within it. 
I am tired of the decisionmaking process managed by those 
members." In this way, voices calling for a personnel reshuffle 
were heard at the meetings. 
  Among groups which called for giving priority to enacting a 
bill designed to prevent political corruption, a move surfaced 
aimed at pressing President Kono to step down following 
legislation of the political reform bills, and calling for party 
renovation. 
  Ishihara Shintaro and other members who opposed passage of 
the bills intentionally failed to attend the plenary session of 
the House of Representatives wherein a vote on the political 
reform bills was taken. As a future move, they intend to 
strengthen their stand of criticizing the LDP leadership led by 
President Kono. For that reason, therefore, indications are 
that after passage of the political reform bills, such internal 
confrontation will have a negative impact on intra-party debates 
over how to deal with the new electoral system, and the possible 
formation of an alliance with other parties in order to regain 
power.

Planning Agency"] 
  [Text] The Economic Planning Agency Proper; Seeking 
To Shed the Role of Being the "Government Economists Group" 
  The Japanese economy has, at long last, begun to escape from 
the "complex recession," that was caused by the circulating 
impact of capital deflation brought about by drop in the value 
of land and stock following the bursting of the bubble economy, 
and is turning toward recovery. Can the economy smoothly enter 
the road to recovery and, is it possible to transfer our 
economic track to one that will provide for sustained economic 
growth equal to Japanese latent growth potential, which is said 
to be in the middle 3 percent range? It is Economic Planning 
Agency [EPA] that is responsible for analyzing the situation and 
performing general coordination of Japan's economic policy. 
  Last year, EPA accomplished the big job of formulating the 
"Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan," which was a much-touted 
policy matter for the Miyazawa cabinet. Beyond that, they put 
together an emergency economic measure in March 1992 to 
stimulate the still slumping economy and a comprehensive 
economic measure for August. The activities of the EPA have been 
noticeable this year as well as they have done things such as 
put together a new comprehensive economic measure in April, as 
soon as the main budget was adopted. 
  However, their reputation in this regard is not universally 
positive. With regard to their analysis of the business 
conditions, there are such criticisms as "they misjudged the 
period of the recession," and "their decision on business 
conditions was late." Regarding their establishment of economic 
policy, criticism is heard here and there as to whether they 
"are adequately fulfilling their role as the government's 
economic coordination body?" There have even been comments by a 
weekly magazine saying that "the EPA is a big white elephant." 
  The EPA neither has the power to determine the budget, as 
the Ministry of Finance [MOF] does, nor the ability to influence 
business, as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] does. It has little direct, concrete authority. It is a 
government agency whose main mission includes research and 
coordination, and prepare economic plans. It is deplorable 
that the EPA's ability to carry out research and coordination 
should become the butt of criticism. 
  Since the end of the Cold War, the global economy has been 
gripped by various difficult problems, such as the dull economic 
performance among the developed countries, the conversion of the 
former Soviet Union and Eastern European states to market 
economies, and environmental problems on a global scale. What 
path should Japanese economic development take in the course of 
all of this? With regard to international problems, how should 
true international policy cooperation be implemented? 
Domestically, what policy should be adopted to convert Japan 
from a society which places importance on producers to one that 
prioritizes consumers, and will bring about comfortable 
national life? The EPA confronts a wide spectrum of problems, 
and the role that they must fill in order to solve these 
problems is immense. 
  Just how will the EPA respond the criticism coming in from 
various quarters? How will the EPA respond to demands from the 
public? The EPA's stance on these issues in the future is an 
item that will be watched with interest. 
  Looking back on the history of the EPA, it cannot be denied 
that once it was considered a MITI "branch office," but later it 
took on the appearance of being a MITI/MOF "joint venture." Many 
personnel from the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce (the 
present-day MITI) were dispatched to the EPA's antecedent 
organizations; like the Office of Planning which, under the 
National Mobilization Law, promoted Japan's economy before the 
war, and the Economic Stabilization Headquarters, which put its 
efforts into the distribution of foodstuffs and commodities in 
order to promote Japanese economic reconstruction after the war. 
Even after it changed its name to the Economic Review Agency 
in 1952 and to the EPA in 1955, MITI continued to support the 
system by dispatching personnel to take the post of 
administrative vice minister. 
  The MOF joined hands with the proper [a career employee or 
staff member] group and, in 1969, was successful in getting 
"proper treatment" for its Yoshio Kano (a graduate of Tokyo 
University, entered MOF in 1946) and getting him assigned as 
administrative vice minister, breaking MITI's monopoly on this 
post. From that time on, there has been a triangular struggle 
among the MOF, MITI, and the agency for control of the 
top-level posts in the EPA. MOF secures the head of the 
Director General's Secretariat and one bureau chief position, 
MITI gets the position of member of the policy board of the Bank 
of Japan and one bureau chief position, and those ministries and 
the agency proper fight over the posts of administrative vice 
minister. 
  There is a reason for the burning attachment that MITI and 
MOF, the two most powerful ministries in Kasumigaseki place on 
the fight for the top-level positions in the EPA." That is 
because they want to strongly reflect their respective 
ministries view in economic policy measures such as the 
comprehensive economic measures put togetherby by the EPA. The 
ministries will find it easier to implement policies in future 
if their point of view is closely reflected not only in 
emergency economic stimulus measures which were implemented 
three times during current economic recession, but in such 
policy measures as "government economic forecast," which EPA 
prepares for each fiscal year. 
  The conflict between these ministries becomes especially 
vivid revolving around drafting the government economic 
forecast and the midterm economic plans. MITI would push for a 
higher rate of economic growth, while the MOF usually advocates 
a cautious number. For example, in the "Lifestyle Superpower 
Five-Year Plan" that was adopted in 1992, the projected average 
annual rate of net economic growth rate presented was 3.5 
percent. It is said that while MITI argued for a higher rate, 
MOF pushed a lower conservative figure. 
  In the government economic forecast for FY 1993, the 
situation was different as both MITI and MOF pushed for a 
projected net growth rate of 3.5 percent and EPA argued for a 
rate in the low 3 percent range. In the end, a figure of 3.3 
percent was adopted. As usual, MITI pushed for a higher 
economic growth rate in order to stimulate the desire of 
industrial sector, which (it believes) is under its protection, 
to invest in plant and equipment. 
  Usually, the MOF advocates low growth rate lest it will be 
pressured for a higher government expenditures because higher 
growth rate will necessitate a higher estimate of tax revenue 
growth. Last year, however, because of the serious business 
recession, MOF projected a higher growth rate so that it can 
draft an economic stimulas-type of budget, avoiding issuance of 
deficit-covering bonds. 
  It is the job of the EPA to coordinate the figures asserted 
by the two ministries and, while considering the economic 
situation at hand, take a final position, which is usually 
somewhere right in the middle. However, last year the number 
adopted was close to the low number suggested by the EPA, a 
result which shows that the EPA is coming out from under the 
influence of MITI and MOF. 
  In fact, following the administrative vice ministerial 
position held by MOF from June 1986 through June 1987, the 
agency group took over the seat for three consecutive terms. 
Following that, although an official from the MOF was again 
named as administrative vice minister, the seat again reverted 
to the agency proper. This is because the EPA, which is made up 
of "a scratch team," is beginning to turn out capable men to 
take over the position. In the future, the vice ministerial 
position will probably be filled by EPA careerists, and the 
position would be given to MII and the MOF only from time to 
time. However, the scope of administrative ability of the 
agency careerists will probably be scrutinized carefully. To be 
able to bandy with other agencies and ministries, including MOF 
and MITI, on an equal footing, it would be necessary for the 
EPA to put forth unceasing efforts to strengthen itself and 
adjust its posture, in order to avoid becoming the object of 
sarcasm, such as "the EPA has neither money nor power," or "the 
EPA is just the government economists group," at the hands of 
other government ministries and agencies. 
  Furthermore, looking at the personnel who have been selected 
to fill the role of director general of the EPA, although caught 
between MOF and MITI, when powerful ministers were in place, the 
EPA joined the ranks of leading agencies and ministries. 
Several influential leaders greatly enhanced the EPA's 
existence by serving as director generals, such as former Prime 
Minister Takeo Fukuda, who served as deputy prime minister and 
EPA director general concurrently in the Miki cabinet; former 
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who served three terms as EPA 
director general in the second Ikeda, first Sato, and Fukuda 
cabinets; and former MITI Minister Toshio Komoto, who had the 
credentials of being deputy prime minister in the Suzuki and 
second Nakasone cabinets. However, since Komoto, no one in the 
faction leader class has been tasked to serve as EPA director 
general, and that is unfortunate. 
  However, as a result of the splitting up of the LDP and the 
last general election, a coalition government has become 
unavoidable. The political system finds itself in a situation 
where it must change to place importance on the standard of 
living of the people. Under these circumstances, the type of 
individual utilized for the role of director general of EPA 
would also become diverse. 
  Meanwhile, as might be expected of an agency that is being 
called the "government economists group," EPA puts out a lot of 
economists. It provides human resources not only to the 
government, but also to academia and private think tanks, and is 
forming a unique human network known as "EPA line of economists." 
<H3>  Adminstrative Vice Minister, Councilor, and Member of the 
Policy Board of the Bank of Japan </H3>
  The top administrative official of EPA is Administrative 
Vice Minister Tsutomu Tanaka (entered the agency in 1959; 
graduated from Tokyo Metropolitan University, Law and Economics 
Departments). He assumed the seat of vice minister just as 
predicted by the newspaper forecasts published before the June 
personnel moves. Tanaka's installation as administrative vice 
minister returns the post to the agency proper, following three 
terms by agency propers, Takao Akabane, Shinyasu Hoshino, and 
Yasuo Katsumura, followed by Shunji Fukinbara from the MOF, 
and is a continuation of the recent trend to give priority to 
EPA propers for this post. 
  Tanaka sports a splendid mustache, and he is known in the 
EPA 
as "the mustached Tanaka." 
  He has made the rounds of the EPA Research, Planning, and 
Coordination Bureaus, and he is in the international group of 
the EPA as he has served a total of eight years, two terms, in 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD). He has had experience as director of the Coordination 
Bureau's Industrial Economic Affairs Division, chief of the 
International Affairs Division in the Director Gerneral's 
Secretariat of the Environment Agency, director of the EPA's 
First International Economic Affairs Division, director of the 
Coordination Division in the same Bureau, deputy director 
general of the Economic Research Institute, councilor to the 
Coordination Bureau, and councilor to the Planning Bureau 
before being named as director general of the Research Bureau. 
Following that, he was named as director general of the Price 
Bureau and councilor for Economic Planning before receiving his 
current post. He is from Tokyo Prefecture. 
  In his first instructions after assuming current post, 
Tanaka stated that there were difficult aspects in the creation 
of a new global economic order following the end of the Cold 
War, emphasizing the importance of Japan's role in this 
process. He called for a vitalization of the EPA, because, in 
order for the EPA to grapple with this kind of problem, it will 
require "a high level of analytic ability," "bold planning 
power," and "daring coordinating power." 
  The number-two administrative official is EPA Councilor 
Shosuke Tanaka (joined the agency in 1962; graduated in 
humanities and sciences from Saitama University). This post's 
full title is vice minister for International Economic Affairs. 
This is the same level vice ministerial post as the offices of 
deputy vice minister for Financial Affairs in the MOF and 
deputy vice minister in MITI. He attends international vice 
ministerial conferences as EPA representative. To distinguish 
his position from bureau level Councilors, this position is 
known as "EPA councilor" or "agency councilor." 
  He had experience as head of the National Expenditure 
Division in the Department of National Income at the Economic 
Research Institute, director of the Overseas Research Division 
in the Research Bureau, director of the Department of National 
Income at the Economic Research Institute, and deputy director 
general of the Price Bureau before becoming director general of 
the Research Bureau. Following that, he served as director 
general of the Planning and Coordination Bureau of the National 
Land Agency and director general of the Planning Bureau before 
assuming his current post. He is from Tokyo Prefecture. 
  Kuninari Morisei (joined MITI in 1965; a graduate of Tokyo 
University, Law Department) is EPA's member of the policy board 
of the Bank of Japan. An official dispatched from MITI is 
always assigned to this post. Although this official is said to 
be EPA representative, he is, in fact, representing MITI, and he 
often states MITI's and industry's position at the Bank of Japan 
policy committee meetings, which is held twice weekly on 
Tuesday and Friday. He agrees to reductions of the official 
interest rate, and opposes rate increases. 
  He had experience as head of the Reserves Division of the 
Petroleum Department of MITI's Agency of Natural Resources and 
Energy [ANRE], Director General's Secretariat Welfare 
administrator, an industrial researcher at the London Center of 
the Japan External Trade Organization [JETRO], head of the 
Export Insurance Division of MITI's International Trade 
Administration Bureau, head of the Trade Insurance Division of 
the same Bureau, and director of the Industrial Finance Division 
of MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau, before becoming head of the 
Director General's Secretariat Planning Office, director of the 
Commerce and Industry Division for Osaka Prefecture, and deputy 
director general of MITI's International Trade Policy Bureau, on 
his way to his current post. He is from Okayama Prefecture. 
  The EPA is headed up by the director general of Economic 
Planning and the administrative vice minister. Under them comes 
the Director General's Secretariat, five bureaus--Coordination, 
Social Policy, Price, Planning, and Research--and one affiliated 
organization, the Economic Research Institute. 
  Regarding the responsibilities of the various bureaus, it is 
the responsibility of the Coordination Bureau to prepare the 
annual government economic forecast. Furthermore, it has 
responsibility for putting together the emergency and 
comprehensive economic measures that cover all of the various 
agencies and ministries. This bureau literally symbolizes the 
EPA as the government coordination agency. 
  The Economic Welfare Bureau is responsible for consumer 
affairs. It assumes the administrative role in Economic Welfare 
Council, a Prime Minister's advisory organ, which is now 
studying the implementation of product liability [PL]. In 1973 
the Price Bureau split away from the Economic Welfare Bureau 
and the independent Price Bureau received the job of being the 
watchman over prices. Every year, it publishes the price report, 
which analyzes the actual situation with regard to prices, and 
it also watches things such as the situation of the 
distribution of marginal profits caused by the high yen. 
  The Planning Bureau is responsible for preparation of 
"economic plans," such as the the "Lifestyle Superpower 
Five-Year Plan." Each year, the Research Bureau publishes the 
"Economic White Paper," and also prepares the "Monthly Economic 
Report." It is responsible for researching and analyzing the 
internal and external economic environment. 
  The Economic Research Institute prepares annual and 
quarterly statistics on GNP and also performs the basic 
economic analysis. 
<H5>  Director General's Secretariat </H5>
  The Director General's Secretariat is responsible, like the 
Secretariats in other ministries and agencies, for coordinating 
activities with various bureaus, watching over such areas as 
personnel affairs, accounting, and public relations. It is the 
coordinator of the EPA, the government coordinating body. 
  The person who manages this Secretariat is Yoji Wakui 
(entered the MOF in 1946; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law 
Department). This position is held successively by an official 
dispatched from the MOF. This is the bridgehead of the MOF's 
"control of Kasumigaseki." Therefore, it is normal for the MOF 
to dispatch someone of superior talents, a person who has 
experience as first deputy director general of the Budget Bureau 
and who is a likely candidate as vice minister of the MOF, to 
take this position. 
  Wakui had experience as director of the Investigation 
Department of the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau, a budgetary 
planner in the Budget Bureau, a budget officer in the same 
bureau (responsible for construction and public works), director 
of the General Affairs Division of the same bureau, secretary 
to the Prime Minister, and as deputy director general of the 
Budget Bureau before he assumed his current post. He is from 
Chiba Prefecture. He was once temporarily assigned to the EPA, 
and therefore it is of interest to see just how he uses his 
experience to take the helm at the EPA. 
  The head of the Secretarial Division, which is responsible 
for personnel affairs, is Yuzo Kobayashi (joined the EPA in 
1969; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). 
Within the EPA, he is known by the nickname "Kobayu [KOBAyashi 
YUzo]." He is showing a great desire toward the vitalization of 
the EPA. He served in positions such as secretary to the 
director general, director of the Second Economic Cooperation 
Division in the Coordination Bureau, director of the Price 
Coordination Division in the Price Bureau, and director of 
planning in the Planning and Coordination Bureau in the National 
Land Agency before assuming his current post. 
  The director of the Accounts and Budget Division, which is 
responsible for Agency administratie matters, including 
budgeting and accounting, and employee benefits, is Hiroshi 
Yoshida (joined the agency in 1969; a graduate of Kyoto 
University, Economics Department). He had experience as director 
of the Second Research Division of the Research and Development 
Department in the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), 
director of the Second Consumer Affairs Division in the EPA's 
Social Policy Bureau, director of the Remote Islands 
Development Division of the National Land Agency's Regional 
Promotion Bureau, and director of the Business Statistics 
Research Division of the EPA's Research Bureau before assuming 
his current position. 
  Eiji Sakuda (entered MITI in 1969; a graduate of Keio 
University, Economics Department) is the director of the Policy 
Division, which is responsible for things such as general 
coordination within the EPA, Diet policy, and public relations. 
He has had experience as director of the South Asia and Eastern 
Europe Division in MITI's International Trade Policy Bureau, 
head of the Electric Power Development Division of ANRE's Public 
Utilities Department, director of the Basic Chemicals Division 
of the Basic Industries Bureau, and head of the Planning 
Division of ANRE's Petroleum Department before taking up his 
current post. The Public Relations Office is in the Planning 
Division. The current head of the Public Relations Office is 
Izumi Nakafuji (joined the EPA in 1976; a graduate of 
Hitotsubashi University, Economics Department). He has been 
senior exchange researcher at the Economic Research Institute, 
assistant director of General Affairs Division of the Planning 
and Coordination Bureau in the National Land Agency, and a 
resercher in the Price Bureau before assuming his current post. 
  Yoshinori Terui (joined EPA in 1971; a graduate of Tohoku 
University, Economics Department) is the director of the 
Electronic Data Processing Division, which is responsible for 
maintaining and operating the agency's computerized information 
systems. He has served as a researcher in the Research Bureau, a 
researcher in the Planning and Coordination Division of the 
Environment Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau, a 
grievance officer regarding the market opening problem in the 
Coordination Division of the EPA's Coordination Bureau, and as a 
planner in the Planning and Coordination Bureau in the National 
Land Agency before assuming his current position. 
<H5>  Coordination Bureau </H5>
  The director general of the Coordination Bureau, the bureau 
at the heart of the EPA, is Makoto Kobayashi (joined MITI in 
1961; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department). This 
position had been held by officials from the EPA careerist 
group, including Masaru Yoshitomi--Japan's preeminent 
economist--and subsequently by former Director General Yoseki 
Nagase. However, this time around, an official dispatched from 
MITI, with a long record of experience at EPA, has been named 
director general. With regard to the problem of distributing 
marginal profits resulting from the high yen, when he held his 
former job as director general of the Price Bureau, it is said 
that he argued with MITI and ANRE, who were resisting by saying 
"there aren't any marginal profits," and had a survey of the 
impact of marginal profits in utility bills approved by the 
conference of governmental price officials. Just how he will use 
his decisionmaking and work together with two powerful partners, 
MITI and MOF, in the preparation of the government economic 
forecast is a matter of considerable interest. 
  After holding the posts of director of the Price Policy 
Division in MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau, Secretariat 
counselor in ANRE, chief of Personnel Division in the General 
Affairs Division of the Agency of Industrial Science and 
Technology [AIST], and after serving as head of the Planning 
Section in the Petroleum Department, he has been going back and 
forth between MITI and the EPA. He has held the positions of 
chief of the Planning Division in the EPA's Director General's 
Secretariat, director of the Planning Division in the Small and 
Medium Enterprise Agency, councilor to the EPA's Price Bureau, 
director of MITI's Tokyo Bureau of International Trade and 
Industry, and director of MITI's Kanto Bureau of International 
Trade and Industy. After that, he was moved to EPA, where he 
served as a member of the policy board of the Bank of Japan, 
director general of the Research Bureau, and director general of 
the Price Bureau before he assumed his current position. He is 
from Tokyo Prefecture. 
  MITI, which used to control the EPA, has had no vice 
ministerial appointee since 1986. However, Kobayashi is seen as 
the strongest candidate to fill this position next. We wonder 
whether next year will see the naming of an EPA administrative 
vice minister from MITI. 
  The deputy director general of this bureau, Yoichi Okita 
(joined EPA in 1966; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics 
Department) is the eldest son of the late Saburo Okita, a 
former foreign minister. He had experience as director of the 
Price Research Division in the Price Bureau, director of the 
Overseas Research Division in the Research Bureau, and director 
of Research and Planning at the National Institute for Research 
Advancement (NIRA) before becoming director of the First 
Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau. In both 1990 
and 1991, he wrote the "Economic White Paper." His father wrote 
the white paper four times, starting in 1948; therefore, this is 
the second generation on this line, Saburo and Yoichi, who have 
penned the "Economic White Paper." As expected, he has the 
reputation of having precise analytic ability. It will be 
interesting to see just how this will be used in the 
Coordination Bureau. After he served as head of the First 
Domestic Research Bureau, he was a councilor to the Director 
General's Secretariat in the National Land Agency and deputy 
director general of the Economic Research Institute before 
assuming his current position. 
  The other councilor to the Coordination Bureau is Takafumi 
Kaneko (joined the EPA in 1968; a graduate of Yokohama National 
University Economics Department). He had experience in posts 
such as senior researcher in the Economic Research Institute, 
counselor at the Japanese Embassy in the United States, director 
of the First International Economic Affairs Division in the 
Coordination Bureau, and director of the Accounts and Budget 
Division in the Director General's Secretariat of EPA before 
assuming his current post. It is said that, when he was head of 
the Accounts and Budget Division, he had several fierce clashes 
with MOF officials during negotiations on the budget. He will be 
the person in charge of grievances regarding the market-opening 
problem, which affects all of the ministries and agencies, so 
there are high hopes being pinned on his ability to succeed in 
this position. 
  The director of the Coordination Division, the first 
division 
listed on the organizational table of the Coordination Bureau, 
is Makoto Nomura (joined EPA in 1970; a graduate of 
Hitotsubashi University, Economics Department). He has had 
experience as a grievance officer on the market-opening problem 
in the Coordination Division of EPA's Coordination Bureau, head 
of the Price Control Office of the Price Bureau, director of 
planning in the National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination 
Bureau, director of the Coordination Bureau's Second 
International Economics Affairs Division, director of the 
Research Planning Division at the NIRA, and director of the 
International Business Affairs Division of MITI's Industrial 
Policy Bureau before assuming his current position. 
  General coordination of industrial policy is handled by the 
Industrial Affairs Division, which is headed by Yoshiaki 
Umemura (joined MITI in 1973; a graduate of Tokyo University, 
Law Department). He has served in positions such as the head of 
Energy Policy Planning Division in the Director General's 
Secretariat of ANRE before assuming his current position. 
Despite the fact that his successor in this position was from 
the EPA proper, it is customary for this post to be filled by 
someone from MITI. The irector of the First International 
Economic Affairs Division, which handles issues such as trade, 
the international balance of payments, and foreign exchange, is 
Yoichi Nakamura (joined EPA in 1973; a graduate of Tokyo 
Institute of Technology, Engineering Department). He has had 
experience as a senior researcher at NIRA, head of the National 
Expenditure Division of the National Income Department at the 
Economic Research Institute, and director of the Research 
Exchange Department at the Economic Research Institute before 
assuming his current position. The director of the Second 
International Economic Affairs Division is Haruhito Arai (joined 
EPA in 1975; a graduate of Tokyo University, Graduate School of 
Sciences). He has had experience in jobs such as deputy director 
of the Coordination Division of the Coordination Bureau, deputy 
director of the Economic Welfare Policy Division in the Economic 
Welfare Bureau, secretary to the minister, and researcher in the 
First Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau before 
assuming his current position. 
  The director of the Finance Division, which is responsible 
for general coordination of finance policy, is Hiroshi Tsukada 
(joined MOF in 1972; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics 
Department). This post is successively manned by a person 
dispatched from MOF. He has served in posts such as cabinet 
counselor and director of the Research Division of the MOF's 
Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy before assuming his 
current position. The First Economic Cooperation Division is 
headed by Akira Sadahiro (joined EPA in 1971; a graduate of 
Waseda University, Political Economics Department and Osaka 
University, School of Economics). He has had experience in 
positions such as senior researcher at the Economic Research 
Institute, director of the Second Coordination Division at the 
OECF, director of the Research Exchange Division at the Economic 
Research Institute, and director of the Overseas Research 
Division in the Research Bureau before assuming his current 
position. The chief of Second Economic Cooperation Division is 
Susumu Sanbonmatsu (entered MITI in 1975; a graduate of Tokyo 
University, Economics Department). He has had experience as the 
chief of the General Affairs Division of the General Planning 
Department of MITI's Kyushu Bureau of International Trade and 
Industry, head of the Planning Division of the Planning 
Department of JETRO, and head of the Data Processing 
Administration Division of MITI's Director General's Secretariat 
before assuming his current post. 
<H5>  Economic Welfare Bureau </H5>
  The Economic Welfare Bureau, which is responsible for 
development of consumer affairs, is a very young bureau as it 
was founded in 1972. This bureau was established under the Ikeda 
administration, and its development was accelerated under the 
Sato administration. Its purpose was to correct the negative 
effects that the high rate of economic growth was having on 
people's lives. From the working out of a plan to change 
Japanese society from one that placed high importance on the 
producers of goods to one that emphasized, through the formation 
last year of the "Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan," more 
importance has been placed on activities in this regard. 
Currently, it is studying product liability, the so-called 
powerful relief policy for consumers suffering from damage, 
legislate into law and therefore a decision on the product 
liability problem should be made by this fall. 
  The director general of this bureau is Masashi Kato (joined 
EPA in 1962; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics 
Department). He is entering his fourth year as director general 
of this bureau. He was left in office because the product 
liability problem is coming to a climax. He has taken an elite 
course on his road to his current job, serving as director of 
the Overseas Research Division in the Research Bureau, director 
of the First Domestic Research Division in the same bureau, 
director of the Secretarial Division in the Director General's 
Secretariat, and councilor to the Research Bureau. He wrote the 
"Economic White Paper" three times during the last period 
(1985-1987) when there was a strong yen. His reputation as an 
economist is high, and just how he will coordinate and get 
consensus on the PL problem, on which there has not been a 
consensus within the government on how to introduce the measure, 
will continue to hold center stage for a while. He hails from 
Tokyo Prefecture. 
  The councilor to this bureau is Takafusa Shioya (joined EPA 
in 1966; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department). He 
excels in his balanced view, based on his past experience. He 
was dispatched to both the Environment Agency (1971) and the 
National Land Agency (1974) when they were formed, and he has 
also served in the JETRO New York office and at MITI. He has 
served as councilor in the Director General's Secretariat, 
director of the Price Coordination Division of the Price Bureau, 
director of the Commerce Policy Division of MITI's Industrial 
Policy Bureau, director of the Coordination Division of EPA's 
Coordination Bureau, director of the Secretarial Division in the 
Director General's Secretariat, and councilor to the Research 
Bureau before assuming his current post. It is said that his 
ability to coordinate was manifested when, as director of the 
Coordination Division, he coordinated the tug of war between 
MITI and MOF regarding the formulation of the government 
economic forecast. It is hoped that this ability will again 
manifest itself as he coordinates the activities of the 
ministries in connection to the PL problem. 
  The director of the Economic Welfare Bureau, the first 
division in the Economic Welfare Bureau's table of 
organization, is Masataka Hirano (joined EPA in 1969; a graduate 
of Tokyo Teachers College (now the University of Tsukuba) 
Graduate School of Sciences). He has had experience in positions 
such as councilor to the Director General's Secretariat, 
director of the Second Domestic Research Division in the 
Research Bureau, and director of the First Consumer Affairs 
Division in the Economic Welfare Bureau before attaining his 
current position. His previous position was director of the 
First Consumer Affairs Division, a post which was responsible 
for the PL problem. Having been in that position, to bring 
together the entire bureau, he is expected to play an active 
role in the resolution of this problem. 
  The director of the First Consumer Affairs Division, which 
is 
responsible for consumer protection and directly responsible for 
the PL problem, is Yuko Ishida (joined EPA in 1970; a graduate 
of Tokyo University, Economics Department). He has held 
positions such as chief of the Research Division of the 
Economic Department of the Fair Trade Commission's 
Administrative Bureau, senior planning officer (responsible for 
prices) in the Planning Bureau, and director of the Planning and 
Coordination Division of the Environment Agency's Nature 
Conservation Bureau before assuming his current post. Yoshiaki 
Taguchi (joined the agency in 1974; a graduate of Tokyo 
University, Law Department) is director of the Second Consumer 
Affairs Division, which is responsible for things such as 
consumer groups. Leading up to his current position, he has held 
jobs such as researcher in the Coordination Bureau, and director 
of the Public Relations Office in the Director General's 
Secretariat's Planning Division. 
  The director of the Economic Welfare Research Division, 
which 
is responsible for the "Economic Welfare White Paper," is Makoto 
Kondo (jointed EPA in 1972; a graduate of Kyoto University, 
Economics Department). He has held positions such as planner 
(responsible for weights and measures) in the Planning Bureau 
before assuming his current position. This fall, he will be 
challenged with the preparation of his first white paper, and 
now that hopes are being placed on change in society placing 
greater importance on the standard of living, we would like to 
see him lay out clearly the path that will be taken to build a 
"lifestyle superpower." 
<H5>  Price Bureau </H5>
  This is the youngest bureau. It split away from the Economic 
Welfare Bureau, becoming independent in June 1973. Price 
stability is its greatest responsibility. Since the beginning of 
this year, the strengthening of the yen has continued, and there 
are growing demands from the public for a distribution of the 
marginal profits resulting from the high yen and for further 
rectification of the differences in prices at home and abroad. 
Opposition has been expressed by industries connected to the 
lowering of public utility prices, such as electricity fees, 
that would be brought about by the distribution of marginal 
profits from the high yen. MITI is also aware of this fact; 
therefore, in the future, this bureau's true worth as price 
watchmen will probably be called into question. 
  The director general of the Price Bureau is Michisato 
Sakamoto (joined MOF in 1964; a graduate of Tokyo University, 
Law Department). After the last administrative vice minister, 
Shunji Fukinbara, left office, he was the only bureau director 
general from the MOF left at EPA. He joined EPA as councilor to 
the Planning Bureau. Just what kind of activity can we expect 
from him, being a future MOF candidate for the office of vice 
minister? The Price Bureau will be the starting point for the 
honing of his skills. 
  He has had experience in positions such as director of the 
Mutual Assistance Insurance Division of MOF's Budget Bureau, 
director of the General Affairs Division in the Economy Bureau, 
Customs director at Yokohama, director of the Customs Division 
at the National Tax Administration Agency, director of Direct 
Taxe Department at the National Tax Administration Agency, and 
director of the Taxation Department at the National Tax 
Administration Agency before assuming his current position. He 
is from Tokyo Prefecture. 
  This bureau has three councilors, of which one, Yoichi 
Takemoto, is also serving as councilor to the Planning Bureau. 
Therefore, we will introduce only two other councilors here. 
  Councilor Masaru Yanagizawa (joined the EPA in 1967; a 
graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department) went from 
being director of the First International Economic Affairs 
Division in the Coordination Bureau to an elite temporary 
assignment as director of the Planning Division in the National 
Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau. After that he 
served as councilor to the Coordination Bureau before assuming 
his current position. As councilor to the Coordination Bureau, 
he was responsible for preparation of the new midterm goal for 
official development assistance (ODA) and grievance policy for 
the market-opening problem, which affects plus and minuses for 
the various ministries and agencies. 
  Of the other councilors, Tsugio Ide (joined MITI in 1967; a 
graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department), has been 
dispatched from MITI. There are few people who can correctly 
read the Chinese characters that make up his name. They are read 
"Tsugio." He has held posts such as first secretary in the 
Japanese Mission (Paris) to the OECD, director of the Research 
Division of the Industrial Policy Bureau, director of the 
General Affairs Division of the Basic Industries Bureau, and 
director of the Small Enterprise Department in the Small and 
Medium Enterprise Agency before assuming his current post. In 
the EPA, he has served as director of the Policy Division in the 
Director General's Secretariat. He is the second son of the 
former chief of the Director General's Secretariat, Ichitaro Ide. 
  The director of the Price Policy Division, the first 
organizational division in the bureau which is responsible for 
general coordination of price policy, is Hideaki Yamakawa 
(joined the agency in 1969; a graduate of Tokyo University, 
Economics Department). He has served in positions such as senior 
planning officer (responsible for prices) in the Planning 
Bureau, director of the Price Research Division in the Price 
Bureau, and director of the Director General's Secretariat 
Information Systems Division before assuming his current post. 
  This position has historically been held by a person 
dispatched from MOF, but starting with Yamakawa's predecessor, 
this position has been given to someone from the agency proper. 
It is said that people from the agency proper are getting first 
crack at being named as division directors because the agency 
has developed as an organization. 
  The very busy director of the Price Coordination Division, 
which is responsible for reform of the public utility charges 
for things such as gas, electricity, and telephone, is Jun 
Hamano (joined the agency in 1974; a graduate of Tokyo 
University, Economics Department). He has served in positions 
such as head of the Economic Structural Coordination Promotion 
Office in the Planning Bureau and counselor to the Director 
General's Secretariat before assuming his current post. His 
activities in his current post, which is the position most 
focused on the problem of the distribution of the public 
utilities marginal profits derived from the high yen, are 
greatly anticipated. The director of the Price Research 
Division, which is responsible for performing research on 
prices, is Nobuhiko Kosuge (joined EPA in 1970; a graduate of 
Tokyo University, Engineering Department). He has served in 
positions such as senior researcher at the Economic Research 
Institute and eputy senior researcher at the Middle East 
Economic Research Institute before assuming his current position. 
<H5>  Planning Bureau </H5>
  While the Coordination Bureau is responsible for short-term 
economic measures, the Planning Bureau is responsible for 
midterm economic plans. Because they just completed the 
"Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan" in June 1992, which was 
the government's new midterm economic plan, they have no major 
projects in the offing; however, they are forming study 
committees to look at the theme of follow-up to the "Lifestyle 
Superpower Five-Year Plan." Along with carrying out the 
execution of this effort, they are also recharging their 
batteries in preparation for their next major effort. 
  The director general of this bureau is Atsushi Yoshikawa 
(joined the agency in 1962; a graduate of Osaka University, 
Economics Depertment). He has held positions such as director of 
the International Division of the Environment Agency's Director 
General's Secretariat, director of the First International 
Economic Affairs Division in EPA's Coordination Bureau, director 
of the Coordination Division in the same bureau, councilor to 
the Coordination Bureau, and director of the Economic Research 
Institute before assuming his current position. In 1978, as an 
assistant to Nobuhiko Ushiba, the minister responsible for 
foreign economic affairs, he had to grapple with formulation of 
the market-opening policy and brought together several policy 
measures during the period of high yen following the 1985 Plaza 
Accord. He is from Nara Prefecture. 
  The councilor to this bureau is Koichi Tani (joined EPA in 
1965; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). On 
the way to his current position, he has held posts such as 
director of the First International Economics Affairs Division 
in the Coordination Bureau, director of the Coordination 
Division in the same bureau, director general of the MOF's 
Hokuriku Financial Affairs Bureau, councilor to the Coordination 
Bureau, and councilor to the Price Bureau. His trademark is his 
splendid beard. 
  The other councilor is Yoichi Takemoto (joined the Ministry 
of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] in 1966; a 
graduate of Kagoshima University, Agriculture Department). He 
has been dispatched to the EPA from the MAFF. He has held posts 
such as counselor in the Director General's Secretariat, 
director of the Groceries, Oils, and Fats Division of the Foods 
and Marketing Bureau, and director of the Director General's 
Secretariat Research Division before assuming his current 
position. 
  The only director of the first organizational division in 
this bureau, Shoji Takahashi (joined the MOF in 1970; a graduate 
of Hitotsubashi University, Economics Department). He has 
served in positions such as director of the Secretariat Planning 
Division in the Fair Trade Commission's Administration Bureau, 
director of the National Treasury Division of the Finance 
Bureau, and director of the Special Investigation Division of 
the Administration Bureau of the Security Exchange Oversight 
Committee before assuming his current post. The post of director 
of the Planning Division is always given to someone dispatched 
from the MOF, and this post has become the beachhead for the 
MOF to have its views reflected in the formulation of the 
government midterm economic plans. 
  The Planning Division is the only organization in the bureau 
with the title of division, but the bureau also includes 10 
divisional director-level senior planning officers, who are 
responsible for, international economic affairs; general 
industry; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; labor and human 
resources; finance; social infrastructure;, national life; 
regional economics; prices; and weights and measures; and one 
senior officer for Electric Power Development Planning. Each of 
these officers has considerable staff under them. 
<H5>  Research Bureau </H5>
  The Research Bureau is responsible for carrying out various 
research projects, including the "Economic White Paper," which 
is published once each year, the "Monthly Economic Report," 
which is published monthly and contains the government's views 
on business conditions, and the "International Economic White 
Paper," which is published annually. This is the bureau in the 
EPA which is most well known outside of the agency, and it is 
also the bureau which is the EPA's billboard. 
  The bureau's director general, Seiichi Toshida (joined the 
agency in 1964; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics 
Department), is a government economist in the international 
school, who has written and translated works such as 
Reaganomics, and The President's 
Economics. He has gone through an elite course of 
positions, including minister's secretary, counselor at the 
embassy in Washington, director of the First International 
Economic Affairs Division in the Coordination Bureau, director 
of the First Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau, 
director of the Secretarial Division in the Director General's 
Secretariat, and councilor to the Coordination Bureau. He was 
the first in the 1964 group to achieve the rank of bureau 
director general. The fact that, as the director of the First 
Domestic Research Division, he twice penned the "Economic White 
Paper" testifies that he is a strong economist with regard to 
the domestic economy as well. He has also showed his ability as 
an administrator, and it is said that he is a future candidate 
for the position of vice minister. He is from Kanagawa 
Prefecture. 
  The councilor is Yasuko Niimura (joined EPA in 1967; a 
graduate of International Christian University, Liberal Arts 
Department). Following an official of EPA Eiko Kawana, 
currently the senior researcher at the Tokyu General Research 
Institute, who once served as councilor to the Economic Research 
Institute, Niimura is the second female councilor to hold a 
position in the EPA. She has held positions such as senior 
researcher at the Economic Research Institute, director of the 
Second Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau, 
director of the Social Policy Research Division in the Social 
Policy Bureau, and director of the Social Policy Division of the 
same bureau before assuming her current post. As director of the 
Social Policy Research Division, she wrote the "social policy 
white paper" three times. She incorporated a unique point of 
view into the question of "social policy," and her papers 
stimulated discussions on various matters. Her activities as 
councilor to the Research Bureau are eagerly anticipated. 
  The director of the Research Bureau's first organizational 
division, the First Domestic Research Division, which is 
responsible for the "economic white paper," is Takao Komine 
(joined the agency in 1969;a graduate of Tokyo University, 
Economics Department). He has held posts such as head of the 
Research Division of the Economic Department of the Fair Trade 
Commission's Administrative Bureau, director of the First 
International Economic Affairs Division of the Coordination 
Bureau, and cabinet counselor before assuming his current 
position. He has a good reputation as an economist with many 
books to his credit, including Change in the Structure of 
the Japanese Economy, the English translation of which was 
published in an authoritative U.S. academic magazine. He is 
endeavoring to make the wording of the "Monthly Economic 
Report," which is said to be difficult to comprehend, more easy 
to understand. If one reads this year's "white paper" it can be 
understood that he makes the point of his argument very clear. 
  The First Domestic Research Division (formerly called the 
Domestic Research Division, and the Research Division) is called 
"the government economist's jewel" and it has turned out a large 
number of talented personnel. These include the late Former 
Foreign Minister Saburo Okita and the late Yonosuke Goto, who is 
the all time record holder having penned six "white papers," 
including the 1956 edition which is known by the name, "It's No 
Longer the Post-War Era." The list goes on and on, including 
Hisao Kanamori, chairman of the Japan Economic Research Center, 
Isamu Miyazaki, director of Daiwa Research, the late Takao 
Sasaki, the former director of the Joint Research Institute for 
Life Development, Takeo Takahashi, director of the same, Takao 
Akabane, Keio University professor, and Yasuo Katsumura, the 
former vice minister. 
  The director of the Second Domestic Research Division, which 
is responsible for analyzing trends by region and by industrial 
sector, is Kaoru Yoshikawa (entered the agency in 1972; a 
graduate of Kyoto University, Economics Department). He has held 
positions such as researcher in the Research Bureau, head of the 
National Economic Calculation Research Office in the National 
Income Department in the Economic Research Institute, and senior 
researcher at the Joint Research Institute for Life Development 
before assuming his current position. 
  The director of the Overseas Economic Research Division, 
which is responsible for researching and analyzing the trends in 
overseas economics and for the "International Economic White 
Paper," is Minoru Ikeda (joined the agency in 1971; a graduate 
of Tokyo University, Law Department). He has held positions such 
as secretary to the director general, senior researcher in the 
Economic Research Institute, director of the Second Consumer 
Affairs Division in the Social Policy Bureau, and director of 
the First International Economic Affairs Division in the 
Coordination Bureau before attaining his current post. 
  The director of the Business Statistics Research Division, 
which is responsible for researching and analyzing business 
statistic trends, such as the business condition trend index 
number (DI [diffusion index]), is Yoshiro Tokunaga (joined EPA 
in 1969; a graduate of Osaka University, Economics Department). 
He has served in positions such as director of the Price 
Research Division in the Price Bureau, director of the Overseas 
Research Division in the Research Bureau, and senior researcher 
in the Economic Research Institute before assuming his current 
job. 
<H5>  Economic Research Institute </H5>
  The Economic Research Institute performs basic, general 
research into areas such as basic economic structure and cycle, 
national income and national wealth, and other aspects of the 
economy.. It is divided into the Researcher Office and the 
Department of National Accounts, and the Research Exchange 
Office, which was newly established in 1990. 
  In the Research Office, there are three supervisory 
researchers, eight or fewer senior researchers, and a few guest 
researchers. Famous University professors are invited to become 
guest researchers, and in this way, effort is put into exchanges 
with the academic sector. 
  Just recently, the major economics-related ministries and 
agency have founded associated research institutes, namely the 
MOF's Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, MITI's Research 
Institute of International and Trade, and the Ministry of Posts 
and Telecommunications [MPT] Research Institute of Posts and 
Telecommunications, to build up the arsenals of theory needed 
for the execution of policy. However, the EPA's Economic 
Research Institute was a pioneer for all of these institutes. 
  The director general of the Institute is Isoroku Sawada 
(joined EPA in 1965; a graduate of Tokyo University, Mathematics 
and Physics Department). He has served as director of the 
Electronic Data Processing Division in the Director General's 
Secretariat, supervisory researcher in the Economic Research 
Institute, councilor to the Research Bureau, and councilor to 
the Coordination Bureau before assuming his current position. He 
hails from Kochi Prefecture. 
  The deputy director general is Yoichi Kojima (joined the 
agency in 1967; a graduate of Tokyo University, Education 
Department). He has served in positions such as director of the 
Overseas Research Division of the Research Bureau, director of 
the First Economic Cooperation Division in the Coordination 
Bureau, and supervisory researcher in the Economic Research 
Institute before assuming his current post. When he was serving 
as the supervisory researcher, as part of government's technical 
cooperation with Romania, where he was dispatched for three 
months, he gave advice regarding the conversion of the Romanian 
system to a market-based economy. In recognition for this 
service, he was given a plate of thanks from the Romanian 
Government. 
  The director of the Administrative Division, Hiroshi 
Nakatsugawa (joined the MPT in 1956; a graduate of Ryokoku High 
School), has served in positions such as Director General's 
Secretariat Diet Communications Coordination officer, and as 
head of the EPA's branch of the National Diet Library on his way 
to assuming his current post. 
  Supervisory Researcher Masahiro Ikegami (joined EPA in 1968; 
a graduate of Waseda University, Business Department) served in 
positions such as head of the Price Control Office in the Price 
Bureau and as senior planning officer in the Metropolitan 
Infrastructure Bureau of the National Land Agency before 
assuming his current position. Supervisory Researcher Masaru 
Eto (joined EPA in 1971; a graduate of Kyushu University, Law 
Department) has served in roles such as senior lanning officer 
(responsible for prices) in the Planning Bureau before assuming 
his current post. 
  The director of the Research Exchange Division, an 
organization responsible for things such as the exchange of 
researchers with foreign research organizations, is Nobuki 
Sugita (joined EPA in 1977; a graduate of Tokyo University, 
Mathematics and Physics Department). He has held positions such 
as deputy director of the General Affairs Division of the 
National Land Agency's Regional Promotion Bureau and as a 
senior exchange researcher at the Economic Research Institute 
before assuming his current position. 
  The director of the Department of National Accounts, which 
is 
responsible for calculating the GNP, is Yoshikuni Kobayashi 
(joined EPA in 1968; a graduate of Tokyo University, Engineering 
Department). He has served as a senior planning officer in the 
Planning and Coordination Bureau of the National Land Agency, 
chief researcher at the Japan General Research Institute, and 
director of the Electronic Data Processing Division in the 
Director General's Secretariat before assuming his current 
post. Genjiro Watanabe (joined the MAFF in 1964; Chuo 
University, Law Department), director of the National 
Expenditure Division served in positions such as head of the 
Production Division of the Economic Research Institute's 
Department of National Accounts before assuming his current 
position. 
  Besides the above-listed persons serving in positions within 
the EPA, there are also EPA personnel serving in other 
ministries and agencies. First, there is Shinpei Nukaya (joined 
the agency in 1963; a graduate of Tokyo University, Liberal Arts 
Department), who is serving as director general of the National 
Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau. The Planning and 
Coordination Bureau used to be the EPA's General Development 
Bureau, but it was incorporated into the National Land Agency 
in a reorganization. Therefore, the director general of this 
bureau is always someone dispatched from EPA. Nukaya has served 
in jobs such as director of the Price Coordination Division in 
the Price Bureau, director of the Planning Division in the 
National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau, 
director of the Coordination Division of the EPA's Coordination 
Bureau, director of the EPA's Secretarial Division, and 
councilor to the Planning Bureau before assuming his current 
post. His activities once he returns to the EPA are greatly 
anticipated. 
  Eiji Kawade (joined EPA in 1976; a graduate of Kyoto 
University, Economics Department), is currently serving as 
councilor to the National Land Agency's Regional Promotion 
Bureau. He has previously served as director of the EPA's 
Secretarial Division before assuming his current post. There are 
other officials from the EPA who are serving in other 
ministries and agency who are said to be superb personnel, 
including Ichiro Shirakawa (joined EPA in 1968; a graduate of 
Keio University, Graduate School of Economics), who is serving 
as director of the Administrative Division in MITI's Small and 
Medium Enterprises Agency; Shunichiro Ushijima (joined EPA in 
1971; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department), who 
is serving as director of the Planning Division of the National 
Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau; Satoshi Kawamoto 
(joined the agency in 1971; a graduate of Tokyo University, 
Engineering Department), who is serving as director of the 
Planning Division of the National Land Agency's Metropolitan 
Areas Development Bureau, and Takashige Komoda (joined EPA in 
1972; a graduate of Tokyo Institute of Technology, Economics 
Department), who is serving as a cabinet councilor in the 
cabinet's Foreign Policy Councilors Office. 
  The EPA, in which the influence of MOF and MITI had been 
strong, has begun to become a powerful organization and is 
becoming more independent. This trend can be seen in the area of 
personnel assignments as well. In these times, when the 
one-party rule of the LDP has been broken and the various 
parties, including the Japan New Party, are raising the banner 
of the importance of standard of living, the role of the EPA, 
which coordinates the government's economic policy, has become 
even more important. What is required of them is to respond 
adequately to the changing political situation and to develop 
policies aimed at the realization of an abundant standard of 
living for the people of Japan. 
  Although the EPA will probably be buffeted by the raging 
waves of the power politics of Kasumigaseki, we would like to 
hope that it will show its power as the government's 
coordinating agency, standing firmly above the popular 
criticisms.

<F P=106> [Article by KANKAI special reporting team: "The `Left-Wing </F>
Faction' of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, a Tragedy of 
the Coalition Ruling Camp's Largest Party"] 
  [Text] In the face of an unprecedented crisis feared to 
bring about even its collapse, the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] made a new start by electing the new executive 
leadership, including Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and General 
Secretary Wataru Kubo at its party convention in late September. 
The convention approved, among others, promotion of an election 
system combining proportional representation and small electoral 
districts, and the party thus appears to have settled pending 
issues for the time being. However, the seeds of dissention are 
continuously smoldering because the new executive lineup was 
formed on the initiative of the left-wing faction and all 
election-related posts are occupied by a group assuming a 
cautious position toward the combined formula on the election 
system. The SDPJ is the largest party in the ruling camp, but 
neither the group promoting the combined formula nor the group 
using prudence shown clear visions for the survival of the 
party. As a result, the introversive logic--which retains traces 
of the "1955 system" [the two-party system formed in 1955 with 
creation of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the SDPJ]--is 
going unchallenged within the party . The fear that, with its 
increasing left-wing tinge, the SDPJ might be a "powder keg" in 
the Hosokawa coalition government is becoming a reality, though 
this fear was noted at the outset. 
  A very difficult problem was put forward at the SDPJ 
convention in late September which was held to elect the new 
executive leadership. 
  The problem was: The SDPJ suffered a historical crushing 
defeat in the July general election. Nevertheless, it achieved 
the long-cherished desire to overthrow the LDP and participated 
in the coalition government. However, the people's support only 
keeps falling sharply, and they do not appreciate us at all. We 
have agreed to the introduction of the combination of 
proportional representation and small electoral districts which 
might become our own grave in the future. Now, how can the SDPJ 
restore the people's support and survive? Show the way. 
  This is like asking one to find a way to carry out a funeral 
and a wedding at the same place at the same time and to satisfy 
all of the attendants. 
  This is a difficult and strange demand, judging from common 
sense exercised in the political world thus far. 
  Accordingly, the way to resolve this problem cannot be found 
unless an approach totally different from the conventional one 
is used. The problem will prove to be utterly unsolvable as long 
as the party uses the kind of Diet-steering arithmetic prevalent 
under the 1955 system--an arithmetic in which "one plus one" 
makes three or one. However, the answer given in the recent 
party convention represented a solution reached by the use of 
the "1955 arithmetic" in whatever way we may look at it. 
<H5>  Still Competent To Make Leftward Bounce </H5>
  In the election of the chairman, Mr. Kubo, regarded as the 
most likely winner, hurriedly withdrew his candidacy as a result 
of a closed-door adjustment. Mr. Murayama, who is rather plain 
as the face of the party, declared his candidacy. Setting aside 
a character sketch, it was hard to understand why the chairman 
should be Murayama, not Kubo. However, there was clear logic 
within the SDPJ in this connection. 
  The election to decide Chairman Sadao Yamahana's successor 
after he expressed his desire to resign was intended not only to 
clarify responsibility for the defeat in the general election. 
It was an intraparty struggle for leadership waged by inquiring 
into causes for the defeat, that is, by discussing the rights 
and wrongs of the past policy line, and of deciding what policy 
line should be taken now. During the era when the SDPJ was an 
opposition party, the party's left-wing faction rapped the 
executive leadership, reasoning that "the party has invited the 
people's criticism because it inched close to the line of the 
LDP." As a result, the party followed the course of leaning to 
the left. It made the so-called "leftward bounce." 
  In the recent party convention, because of the 
aforementioned 
complicated setup, the logic of the leftward bounce--a 
perception under the 1955 system, that is, Japan's cold war 
structure--prevailed although the party found it hard to draw a 
straight monolithic conclusion as in the past. 
  The interest of the mass media and the people in the 
chairman's election was concentrated on what distance the SDPJ 
would maintain with the Hosokawa coalition government and how it 
would handle the combination of proportional representation and 
small electoral districts; however, SDPJ members were looking at 
the candidates Kubo and Murayama from a different perspective. 
  The two persons did not differ in the basic position that 
they would work to maintain the coalition government and promote 
the combination of proportional representation and small 
electoral districts. But Mr. Murayama's emphasis on respect for 
"intraparty democracy" drew attention. 
  He merely told the simple, taken-for-granted truth that 
important decisions should unfailingly be made through 
discussions at appointed organs. However, this remark assumes a 
deeper meaning when viewed in the light of the SDPJ's actual 
condition. Deciding things through organs means that party 
organizations should make full arguments in a proper order and 
finally await the conclusion at the party convention. This means 
that matters to be decided should unfailingly be referred to 
local organizations for discussion and that the party cannot 
ignore the intentions of the local organizations, which hold 80 
percent of party members and a majority of deputies to the party 
convention. 
  In view of the actual situation in which most local party 
members are leftist activists, organizational discussions are 
tantamount to letting arguments go through a leftist filter at 
all stages, and so it also means that policies cannot pass 
unless they are acceptable to the left-wing faction. 
  In the past as well, many reform plans backed down from 
original drafts in the process of debate and were finally torn 
to pieces through alterations. The real substance of attaching 
importance to intraparty democracy is synonymous with revival 
and maintenance of the leftist-wing faction. 
  The reason why the members looked to intraparty democracy 
was 
the issue of the combination of proportional representation and 
small electoral districts. The SDPJ at its 1991 convention 
decided to oppose the combination formula, saying that "its 
introduction will not be permitted." Changing this decision 
requires the approval of the party convention or the Central 
Committee. However, the Yamahana executive leadership did not 
take these proceedings at all. 
  The local organizations, actual election-performing forces, 
had a strong sense of crisis from the feeling that the SDPJ 
would be dead and buried under the combination formula. In the 
eyes of the local organizations, this was why the party made the 
decision against the formula through debate, but Chairman Sadao 
Yamahana changed the decision arbitrarily without any 
consultations. They felt that this was critical and that 
something should be done to curb it. 
  It was not only the combination formula. Those local forces 
also could not overlook the issue of another condition for the 
sharing in the government--"succeeding the policies held up 
until now (under the LDP government) regarding fundamental 
national policies such as diplomacy and defense." They feared 
that if this position were pursued as intended, they could not 
carry out struggles against bases and atomic bombs which had 
formed the centerpiece of activities by local organizations. 
They felt that such a development might lead to the collapse of 
the party organization itself and that, therefore, the decision 
on the condition was a matter of life or death for the party. 
  However, the decision was also made arbitrarily by the 
executive leadership. In his candidacy announcement, Mr. 
Murayama said: "What the SDPJ should do now is to rally the most 
excellent traditions, talents, and qualities of the SDPJ and its 
members and take a new look at the `mind' of the SDPJ" (SHAKAI 
SHIMPO)." He then added that "the first step toward this end is 
the thorough implementation of intraparty democracy." In these 
remarks, he expressed local fears on behalf of the local members. 
  The election of the chairman came to an end in an instant. 
On 
9 September, the date for the candidacy application in the 
election, 25 chief secretaries of prefectural headquarters 
across the nation assembled in a hotel in Tokyo and decided to 
support Murayama. It is said that 10 additional persons 
expressed the desire to join in the move although they did not 
attend the meeting. This number shows how strong the local voice 
was. No one could be his match under these circumstances. Upon 
hearing this development, Mr. Kubo gave up his candidacy. 
  The Murayama executive leadership was thus formed on the 
basis of misgivings by local organizations. All the more because 
of this, he is hog-tied by local pressures. Mr. Yamahana was 
compelled to take responsibility for his arbitrariness, but the 
coalition government became possible because he pushed his way 
in this arbitrary manner. Conversely, it will be structurally 
impossible to expect the Murayama executive leadership to follow 
the same position in the future. 
<H5>  Prepared To Accept Split? It Is To Make Final Choice </H5>
  The person who called for the meeting of 25 chief 
secretaries 
which played a determining role in deciding the next chairman 
was former Vice Chairman Masahiro Yamamoto, a leftist big wheel 
who, though living in retirement, had covert influence with 
local organizations and the party headquarters. He was the prop 
of the "Society for Building a New SDPJ," a power base for Mr. 
Yamahana's rise, seceded from the society in opposition to the 
combination formula and became the motive power for Chairman 
Murayama. 
  On the evening of that day, the 25 persons assembled at the 
official residence of the lower house speaker and met Speaker 
Takako Doi. Ms. Doi reportedly expressed the hope that they 
would promote their position in consultations with Mr. Yamamoto 
in the future. And in the election of the chairman, the Murayama 
camp was joined by former General Secretary Tsuruo Yamaguchi, a 
member of the rightist Suiyokai and former Diet Administration 
Committee Chairman Shun Oide. The two are close to Ms. Doi as 
members of the force for constitutional protection and have held 
strong anti-Tanabe (former Chairman Makoto Tanabe) feelings. 
  In this context, it may be said that the Murayama system is 
in substance "Doi's new party" which has been formed around Ms. 
Doi, joined by local activists, left-wing lawmakers, and some 
rightist members, and rallying the force for protection of the 
Constitution. This is clear from a passage in Mr. Murayama's 
candidacy announcement that "it is naturally an important part 
of our job to create an impressive and vigorous Diet easy to 
understand for citizens in support of Ms. Takako Doi, who, 
bearing the most excellent SDPJ traditions upon her shoulder, 
was inaugurated as the House of Representatives speaker." 
  Ms. Doi appears to have firmed up her determination to 
restore the SDPJ as a party for protection of the Constitution 
amid the SDPJ's crushing defeat and establishment of the non-LDP 
coalition regime on the initiative of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. This is also the 
determination to block the two-conservative party doctrine. 
  The general outline was shown when Mr. Yamahana asked Ms. 
Doi 
to take office as speaker of the House of Representatives. In 
the process of consultations between the two persons from late 
July to August, it became clear that Ms. Doi's concrete goals 
were to shift the chairmanship to the hand of the left-wing 
faction, to strengthen the SDPJ's subjectivity, and to realize 
the combination formula in such a way as to enable the tripolar 
system, not the two major party system. The Murayama system 
should thus be looked upon as deep-rooted. It is, in fact, 
impossible to solidify, as in the past, the ties between leftist 
and rightist factions under the anti-LDP banner alone now that 
reorganization of the political world has become a reality with 
the LDP divided and with the SDPJ sending six cabinet members to 
the regime, though it was possible when there was a powerful 
enemy called the LDP in ahe 1955 system. If one is discontented 
with the Murayama line, one has no option but to secede from the 
party. Although the "non-conservative liberals" (Rengo Chairman 
Akira Yamagishi, etc.) equally adopt a tripolar plan, the 
policies they uphold are contradictory to the demands of the 
local organizations and also conflict with the line of 
protecting the Constitution. 
  If the SDPJ aims to promote a coalition government with a 
conservative force no matter which of the two systems [the two 
major party system and the tripolar system] it chooses, it 
cannot help diluting its own unique fundamental policies and 
movement. It may insist on a coalition government retaining the 
SDPJ's subjectivity, but this is simply a castle in the air in 
view of its current competence. The SDPJ has now come to its 
final fork in the road. 
<H5>  Between Political Regime and Subjectivity </H5>
  One branch of the road is the two major forces system and 
the 
other is the tripolar system. 
  Mr. Tanabe of the reformist faction views that the political 
world will shift along a moderate multiparty system under two 
big political forces for the time being. On the basis of this 
view, he stresses that "in responding to the reorganization of 
the political world, we should be ready to participate in it 
actively, not passively, and to this end we should have the 
determination to even readily "disband the party" if the people 
request it and conditions are mature for it." According to Mr. 
Tanabe, a party is "nothing but a means and tool for changing 
politics in compliance with the people's desires," and he argues 
that "we cannot stick to the tool and consequently choose the 
way for getting isolated from the people and `existing only in 
name and being virtually dead.'" Do not be hung up on the banner 
or the party--this is what his stand calls for. 
  This doctrine that the party members should even be ready to 
disband their party is the path that the local organizations, 
the left-wing faction, and Ms. Doi are most alert to. This 
alertness is represented by the argument of former Chairman 
Masatsugu Ishibashi who belonged to the force for constitutional 
protection. Mr. Ishibashi asserts: "There is not a shred of 
persuasiveness in the excuses that it cannot be helped for the 
party to make sacrifices in order to realize the change of 
regime and vitalize parliamentary democracy. This is all the 
truer when we think that the SDPJ's weakening and collapse link 
immediately to revision of the Constitution." The point of his 
argument is that the party should be kept alive with its banner 
upheld persistently. 
  This is by contrast a "survival strategy." Mr. Tanabe's 
assertion is attended with the danger of the party collapse. 
However, in view of the public opinion trends Mr. Ishibashi's 
line also cannot completely dispel doubts about how long the 
line could stay persuasive in the future for expanding the 
SDPJ's power. 
  This is a difficult choice, but the SDPJ has now been driven 
to a point where it cannot but choose either of the two paths. 
It may be said that this time the party has opted for the latter 
path by choosing Chairman Murayama. 
  Yet the party must abide by the agreement on establishment 
of 
the coalition government now that it has actually participated 
in the government and is adopting the motto of maintaining the 
coalition government. In such a case, "succeeding the previous 
regime's policies" will unavoidably become a heavier burden for 
the Murayama executive leadership which attaches importance to 
local forces. As to the estrangement between the SDPJ's inherent 
fundamental policies and the succession of the previous regime's 
policies, Mr. Yamahana could not give any indications except 
saying that "efforts will be made to fill up the gap." 
  Specifically, the party should address the following issues: 
the measure to cope with post-Cambodia PKO (UN peacekeeping 
operations), a revision of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Law so 
as to enable the dispatch of SDF aircraft overseas to rescue 
Japanese nationals, the income tax reduction which has become 
the largest political task, and the consumption tax increase to 
provide a revenue replacement for the income tax reduction. It 
is also pressed hard to strictly observe the distribution of 
fixed seats (250 seats in the small electoral districts and 250 
seats in proportional representation) with regard to the 
combination of proportional representation and small electoral 
districts. The combination formula sustained restrictions 
through a resolution at the party convention. Especially, the 
PKO and consumption tax issues represent a line from which the 
party cannot budge an inch because the former is the symbol of 
Constitutional protection and the latter, that of Ms. Doi. 
  If the SDPJ gives priority to its intraparty position, the 
coalition government now enjoying unprecedented support will 
become an absurd being, and the party will be deserted by the 
people as a criminal responsible for it. On the other hand, if 
it prizes the maintenance of regime, the party's subjectivity 
cannot but recede. Mr. Yamahana solved this dilemma through 
arbitrary action, but it is hard to foresee how Mr. Murayama who 
barred this method on his own will tide over the situation. 
<H5>  Barrier Is 1993 Declaration </H5>
  The new executive leadership's campaign policy is to be 
decided at the party convention to be resumed in January next 
year. The largest point of contention at the convention is how 
to deal with the "1993 declaration." The declaration, a 
realistic line giving a second look at almost all fundamental 
party policies, touched off a strong opposition among the local 
organizations from the outset when it was originally drafted. 
Delegates of chief secretaries across the nation even warned 
(then) Secretary General Hirotake Akamatsu that "if we are not 
consulted with beforehand, we will totally revise it at the 
party convention." 
  The declaration is, in outline, similar to the 
party-founding 
declaration of the Japan New Party, and the reformist faction 
expected the declaration, if adopted, to open the way for the 
formation of a new liberal party joined by the SDPJ even if 
represented by its conservative force. 
  However, in view of the trend shown in the election of 
Chairman Murayama, the fate of the 1993 declaration is already 
as perilous as a light exposed to wind. Mr. Ishibashi criticizes 
this declaration bitterly, saying: "Except for views on the 
Japan-U.S. security arrangement and on the SDF, it makes little 
difference from the new declaration I worked out. However, it 
has its characteristics which are the excessive considerations 
for others' positions and the use of all sorts of flowery 
words." It is unlikely that the 1993 declaration will 
materialize. 
  Attaching importance to intraparty democracy reflects local 
voices, and at the same time means bringing out the color of the 
left-wing faction. Moreover, the present reorganization of the 
political world is so quick in speed that a party cannot catch 
up with it by the SDPJ-type organizational decisionmaking. In 
consideration of these two elements, it is believed that the 
SDPJ will deepen its isolation within the Hosokawa coalition 
government which has begun to show a strongly conservative face 
and that such deepening isolation will make the voice of the 
left-wing faction louder and louder. Such is the phenomenon 
expected to take place. 
  At length, the party will assume the image of a center-left 
political party upholding constitutional protection as its 
slogan. In the Rengo chairman election which was held 
concurrently with the election of the SDPJ chairman, trade 
unions with a strong leftist tinge originating from the former 
Sohyo [General Council of Trade Unions of Japan] rebelled half 
openly against the Yamagishi coalition line. The center-left 
faction is thus clarifying its range of influence. 
  With the 1995 upper house election in mind, the Murayama 
executive leadership will not change its major policy of 
maintaining the Hosokawa coalition government; however, after 
the election it will unavoidably get poised toward establishing 
an SDPJ-centered coalition government. 
  On the other hand, there is a persistent view that, on the 
supposition of the SDPJ dropping out of the Hosokawa coalition, 
Mr. Ozawa has begun working to form a new force which has 
Shinseito, Komeito, and the Democratic Socialist Party as its 
centerpiece and absorbs part of the LDP. In such a case, one 
cannot rule out the possibility that the SDPJ's 
reformist-rightist faction whose foothold has become narrower 
will join in the force. 
  When things develop this way, the bold choice of the 
Hosokawa 
government in consideration of the SDPJ's allergy to Mr. Ozawa 
will no longer be meaningful, and a clearly Shinseito-centered 
government will be produced. The SDPJ's swing toward the left 
will create a momentum to rock the foundation of the Hosokawa 
government. 
  Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone once carved his way 
into the labor world which was the base of support for 
opposition parties, saying that "I will expand the left wing of 
the LDP." New conservative parties such as Shinseito, Sakigake 
[Harbinger], and the Japan New Party have now plucked the fruit 
of his endeavors, and they are now further closing in on the 
citadel of the SDPJ. If the SDPJ upholds its subjectivity, it 
will accelerate the birth of a regime which the SDPJ does not 
want. One thing that is certain in this cynical reality is that 
fire is set to a blasting fuse attached to the SDPJ.

<F P=106> [Article by Masahide Kawashima: "Will a Favorable Wind Arise </F>
for `Decentralization'?"] 
  [Text] This happened when a pianist who is staying in 
Saltzburg, and who returned to Japan for a time in 
mid-September, dined with me. By a whimsical turn of fortune, a 
university president with whom she is acquainted in Austria is 
going to collect and publish "one-page messages" from persons in 
various fields in countries around the world, and she asked me 
to cooperate with him; it was a situation in which I had to 
write one. I sent him something with a stiff, formal title. "The 
Relationship Between the Central Government and the Provinces in 
Japan." 
  At present, we are right in the midst of a "political reform 
Diet session." There is no doubt that the biggest news that 
should be dispatched from Japan is the four political reform 
bills which are fixed mainly on historic changes in the 
electoral system. But it makes me expect that the complications 
will be extraordinary. Moreover, I suspected that things were a 
bit too fishy, even if we take it as fairly certain that it 
would be settled during the Diet session. So I selected for my 
subject the secondary "eye" of the typhoon. 
  To the Hosokawa government, decentralization is not so much 
an extension of political reform as it is something that 
complements, expands, and completes political reform. Is it, 
perhaps, rather a task with the properties of a leading point 
which forms a concentric circle? 
<H5>  Expectations "Because It Is Hosokawa" </H5>
  Certainly one can say that decentralization is the Hosokawa 
government's highest task. Moreover, there are also great 
expectations because of it being the Hosokawa government. 
  First, the lineup. Four persons who have been governors or 
mayors have assembled. Prime Minister Hosokawa spent 10 years as 
the "clan lord" of Kumamoto Prefecture. He is known for the 
"Artopolis policy," which tries to awaken consciousness of urban 
design, the "hands on" plan, which took the lead in computer 
education for elementary and middle school pupils, and for many 
ambitious experiments and bold initiatives in the "Japan first" 
campaign, activation of the prefecture, and regional development. 
  Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, has experience 
as an official in Saitama Prefecture, and he not only advanced 
rapidly to mayor of Yokaichi and governor of Shiga Prefecture, 
he distinguished himself by such environmental policies as the 
Biwa treaty and policies on municipalities and communities. 
Minister of Construction Kozo Igarashi was mayor of Hokkaido's 
Asahikawa, a "shopping paradise"; and Eijiro Hata, minister of 
agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, was the "idea mayor" of 
Oita Prefecture's Hita. That is the lineup. 
  It is not just the lineup. In his keynote address for the 
special Diet session, Prime Minister Hosokawa made his position 
clear, saying, "We must by all means succeed in the tasks of 
relaxing regulations, promoting decentralization, and correcting 
the harmful effect of administration which is compartmentalized 
by competition over turf... and also continue to develop 
regional administration that is filled with a vitality in which 
the region's special characteristics and autonomy are reflected." 
  It cannot be doubted that every government agency will be 
gauging the wind direction toward decentralization as it 
considers development of new policies. Take, for example, the 
Ministry of Construction. Since the formation of the new 
government, it has set forth changes of posture in rapid 
succession: a great reduction in such duties entrusted to 
agencies as decisions on city plans, reconsideration of national 
leadership in wide-area public works, creation of "regional 
improvement action programs" centered on autonomous bodies, and 
so on. I would like to take this to mean that the ministry 
became aware of the political reform goal of eliminating the 
hotbed of politician-bureaucrat-businessman collusion, and 
changing the centralized administration of construction. 
<H5>  The Wind Direction Was Changing </H5>
  But the favorable wind toward decentralization was growing 
much stronger up to the general election. Along with political 
reform, decentralization was gradually being narrowed to an 
issue both at the center and in the provinces. 
  The moves this year to which one should pay attention are 
the 
"wide-region alliance" and "nuclear city" reports of the 23d 
Local Government System Research Council, the proposal of the 
Political Reform Promotion Council (Private Ad Hoc Council on 
Political Reform) for a "decentralization revolution," and the 
"decentralization resolutions" in both houses prior to 
dissolution of the lower house. It was an upsurge, with the 
report of the Third Ad Hoc Council on Administrative Reform, and 
the proposals of the Japan Junior Chamber, Inc. and the National 
Congress for Political Reform, and the trend in the research and 
discussion of the National Governors' Association, and advocacy 
by all political parties of a system of basic law for 
decentralization. 
  Nostalgia also appeared for the past argument for merging of 
prefectures to form "regional" administrative bodies, there were 
also animated calls for a new federal system, and such fruitful 
steps as the Hyogo Prefecture Symposium hosted by the National 
Governors' Association and the National Discussion Conference 
hosted by the Ad Hoc Council on Political Reform were also seen. 
  A number of things can be considered as the background to 
this. First, the changes in the world political and economic 
situation because of the collapse of the cold war structure. The 
fact that the central government should turn its eyes outward, 
and transfer both authority and responsibility for internal 
affairs to autonomous bodies. Diverse multipolar policies on 
national land can be cited as the second, and for the third, 
which is the reverse side of the coin, transfer of authority to 
local areas was sought because there was a genuine grappling 
with such activities as improving district towns. And for the 
fourth, there were demands for structural reform linked to 
political reform; and so on and so forth. 
  It is probable that the circumstances of decentralization 
have begun to differ from when things were, in a real sense, 
driven by an adverse wind in the direction of "neo new 
centralization" by the policy line of "the general settlement of 
accounts for postwar politics" under the Nakasone government. 
<H3>  Toward Basic Laws on Decentralization and Laws To Promote 
Decentralization </H3>
  Among the times when the argument for decentralization has 
surged since the end of World War II, the major special 
characteristics this time are such things as the striking 
enthusiasm of chiefs of prefectures and municipalities who are 
grappling with decentralization, such core parties as the Japan 
New Party also have officially espoused it and begun action, and 
municipalities are concentrating on making it a reality, within 
the scope of what they can do, and have, therefore, elevated it 
to a priority task in such municipal administration as 
ordinances and charters. There were also proposals for a 
national campaign. 
  The point which, more than any other, sets it off decisively 
from past arguments for decentralization is that calls to 
reverse the proper nature of the relationship between the 
central government and the provinces, and to change to a 
blueprint in which the provinces come first in both social 
consciousness and the legal system, occurred without being 
anticipated. 
  Up till now, virtually all assertions in favor of 
decentralization have employed the method of probing minutely 
into such things as work entrusted to state agencies, local 
agencies of the national government, licensing authority and 
subsidies, and seeking a share for the provinces by reorganizing 
the functions and business of central government agencies. It 
was based on the existing centralized administration, under 
which everything is done in instalments. This reverses that. 
Prefectures and municipalities would shoulder authority and 
responsibility for everything concerning domestic affairs, and 
the agencies of the central government would bear a portion 
limited to diplomacy, national defense, planning, and 
preservation covering the entire country, such as currency, and 
adjustment among local governments. 
  It is a view that penetrates to the heart of 
decentralization 
in the general discussion, rather than in later details. The 
National Governors' Conference and the Ad Hoc Council on 
Political Reform proposed it. In the representative 
interpellation at the beginning of the last regular Diet 
session, Sadao Yamahana, who at the time was chairman of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan, sought establishment of a 
system of basic law for decentralization. At a meeting of the 
prefectural assembly, Governor (Toshitami) Mihara of Hyogo 
Prefecture proposed "laws limiting centralization." There are 
various ways of referring to it, such as a basic law on 
decentralization, or laws to promote it, or a basic law on local 
autonomous bodies, but the direction of the argument for 
decentralization is being established. 
<H5>  The Wall Is Still High, But... </H5>
  However, the wall impeding the favorable wind toward 
decentralization is still high. The resistance of central 
government agencies is a force that renders essentially hollow 
the "main purpose of local autonomy," which the new postwar 
Constitution held up as a principle. It is not easy to raze a 
wall that is strengthened by such things as administration 
compartmentalized by turf boundaries, work entrusted to 
agencies, licensing authority, and policy on subsidies. Nor can 
one see that the advent of the new Hosokawa government, which 
makes decentralization its highest task, changed the situation. 
  The symbol of that is the final report of the Provisional 
Council for Promotion of Administrative Reform (Third 
Administrative Reform Council, chaired by Eiji Suzuki). Prime 
Minister Hosokawa is serving as chairman of this council's 
sectional meeting on affluent life, and even when addressing a 
regular meeting after having assumed the post of prime minister, 
he said "I feel that I have returned to a room that is dear to 
me," but in the report is nothing that challenges the wall. The 
resistance of government agencies to compilation of the report 
was dreadful, so it ended with the opinion of some members 
wanting to make clear a posture toward decentralization that 
differed from that of the time of LDP governments, being 
repulsed. 
  Ironically, after the Hosokawa government was born, the 
worst 
situation that puts a damper on the approach to decentralization 
is spreading. The corruption of heads of local governments. 
After the arrest of Mayor Toru Ishii of Sendai and Governor 
Fujio Takeuchi of Ibaraki, the entire system of general 
contractors and the heads of other local governments bodies 
continue to be shaken. 
  When the agitation toward decentralization increases, voices 
from central government agencies arguing against it are heard 
without fail. Will it be safe to transfer authority to the 
provinces; will they be able to handle it; will money not be 
used in a wasteful manner? It is a so-called "catch-all" 
argument. 
  The corruption of a string of headmen and general 
contractors 
evoked uneasiness in the population, to say nothing of agencies 
of the central government. Even if one tries to answer the 
uneasiness by saying such things as "the corruption of money and 
power is the same even for the central government, nay, the 
scale of Lockheed, Recruit, and so on is far greater," and "if 
authority shifts to the provinces, the locus of responsibility 
will be clear, and it is easier to do a thorough job when the 
eyes which are monitoring are near to the public," it sounds 
feeble. It is probably certain that the momentum toward 
decentralization was diminished. I cannot help being 
disappointed. 
<H5>  Rebound by Four Political Reform Laws </H5>
  Even if it were not so, there is confusion in the provinces, 
not so much because of the advent of the Hosokawa government as 
because of the crumbling of the LDP's long rule. At the National 
Governor's Conference that was hosted by the government on 14 
September, the prime minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Takemura received words of the greatest welcome, such as 
"persons who understand the heart of the provinces..." (Governor 
Morihiko Hiramatsu of Oita Prefecture). On the other hand, the 
picture of an uncertain attitude by the provinces is 
conspicuously making the rounds, at the center, of Diet members 
from the prefectures, and in Diet policy in the local areas and 
in dealing with the coalition governing parties and the 
opposition LDP. One can say that it is unavoidable, but to the 
Hosokawa government this, too, is a wall which it must break 
through. 
  The current Diet session is a political reform session, so 
passage of the four bills becomes the goal with the highest 
priority. The outlook has come to be that even the 
opposition-party LDP will have to cooperate in their passage. It 
will probably work out to be a form in which there will be 
decentralization in the future. Transparency and a sense of 
fairness. With the four reform bills as an impetus, the Hosokawa 
government will grapple with decentralization as an extension of 
them. What will it do about the system of laws on administrative 
procedure which was inherited from the previous regular Diet 
session; what will it think of the next-generation 
administrative reform of the Third Ad Hoc Council on 
Administrative Reform, which has finished its mission; will it 
devise a Fifth National Comprehensive Development Plan in 
response to a complete inspection of the Fourth National 
Comprehensive Development Plan, which began in the time of the 
previous government; furthermore, what about a thorough 
relaxation of regulations; what about systematization of opening 
information to the public, and what about a system of basic laws 
for decentralization---? 
  In my "one page message" to Australia [as published], I 
wrote 
that the situation of making a reality of the decentralization 
and local autonomy which retrogressed in terms of the principles 
of the new constitution would probably be difficult for 
Europeans to understand. It can be called a different world from 
that of people who possess a history in which autonomy of cities 
led to nation states. And next, when I am asked for a followup 
report on the "message," I want to dispose of it with one line. 
"True political reform became a reality in Japan."

<F P=106> [Interview with Eiji Suzuki, former chairman of the Third Ad </F>
Hoc Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform, by 
unidentified staff member; place and date not given: "Suzuki 
Says, `Sectionalism Among Bureaucrats, Zoku Members Will Destroy 
Japan'"] 
  [Text] The Third Ad Hoc Council for the Promotion of 
Administrative Reform [the Third Administrative Reform Council 
for short] has closed its business after 123 rounds of 
deliberations in three years. People expected a great deal of 
achievements from the council; yet, in its final report the 
council practically failed to plunge a scalpel into the work of 
reviewing special corporations, thereby inviting strong 
criticism that the report "has had the teeth taken out of it." 
Looking back on the report, Mr. Suzuki says: "I received a great 
cut in my marks for that. I feel great remorse." What on earth 
was the "wall of bureaucrats" which Mr. Suzuki bumped 
against? 
<H5>  "Obstruction" Was Made in Such Way </H5>
  [Suzuki] People ask me what grade I will give to the final 
report and whether it is a passing grade. But I would not have 
submitted the report if I had thought it to deserve a failing 
grade. 
  The latest one was named the "final report." In a strict 
sense, the report was so named simply because it was submitted 
last, and the Third Administrative Reform Council presented six 
reports in all by then. Therefore, I would like to have the 
council evaluated through all of the reports. When the 
securities financing scandal took place, the Third 
Administrative Reform Council fulfilled the task of establishing 
a watchdog agency, and it also proposed enacting the 
administrative procedures legislation. 
  Proposals we made in the three-year period were all good. 
  However, it is a matter of deep regret that, among the 
proposals, I received a great cut in my grade over one related 
to the issue of reviewing special corporations. It was not 
fulfilled due to obstruction by "zoku Dietmen" [group of Diet 
members who exercise in a particular field the policymaking 
expertise and contacts generally acquired through service as 
chairman or vice chairman of the appropriate party policy 
deliberation committee] 
  [SHUKAN GENDAI] The Third Administrative Reform Council was 
inaugurated in October 1990 and studied the way administration 
should be toward the 21st century. Its final report advocates a 
shift "from bureaucratic leadership to private autonomy" and 
calls for installing an "ombudsman's panel on regulation" to 
further ease control and establishing the "New Civil Service 
System Deliberation Council" intended to study and discuss the 
public servant system. The report also carries a proposal that a 
study be made on reorganizing government ministries and 
agencies. Naturally, strong resistance was expected to be made 
from bureaucrats who were anxious to protect their vested 
rights, and the issue of reviewing special corporations agonized 
Chairman Suzuki until the last moment. 
  There are 92 public corporations and business foundations 
categorized as special corporations, and many of them have now 
lost their reasons for existence due to mutually overlapping 
business activities. The council attempted to reduce their 
number through amalgamation and abolition; however, in the end 
it could neither practically mention special corporations by 
name nor indicate reform procedures in its final report. 
  A reporter who covered the Management and Coordination 
Agency 
made the following remarks in this connection: 
  "Concerning the measure to merge and abolish special 
corporations, 34 were picked for the measure from among 92 
corporations in a midterm report in April. Hearings began to 
reduce the number to a little over 10 in May, when the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] zoku Dietmen and bureaucrats launched a 
large counterattack. 
  "Upon learning that they would be summoned to the hearings, 
bureau and division directors made prior visits to zoku Dietmen 
to `ask for their instructions.' Then, zoku Dietmen applied 
pressure on them, saying, `Do not attend the hearings.' The 
officials thus refused to attend hearings. Then came the general 
elections, through which the LDP became an opposition party. The 
council thought that it got a good chance, but it was already 
too late. Hearings for checking assigned tasks of respective 
corporations are indispensable to naming special corporations in 
the report, but it was too late for the council to hold the 
hearings in time for the October report." 
  [Suzuki] I thought that Japan's politicians had an aptitude 
for seeing, speaking, and acting from high perspectives. 
However, they forgot the people and the nation and spoke from 
the standpoint of the business world and on the basis of their 
sectionalism. This is indeed regrettable and unpleasant. 
  No sooner had I intended to take countermeasures than the 
general election campaign began. I was asked to be prudent until 
the end of the election on the grounds that it would disturb the 
election if I dealt with the politicians and did this and that 
during the campaign period. So I waited, and what I saw was the 
shift of power to the other side. 
  However, I think that it is an unusual practice for the 
administration not to attend meetings (hearings) one-sidedly in 
obediance to the zoku Dietmen's voice, and there should not be 
such a practice for anything in the world. This unexpectedly 
revealed that politics so far had essentially been for the 
business world despite politicians' remarks that they stood on 
the side of the people. 
  [SHUKAN GENDAI] Mr. Ken Moroi (chairman of Chichibu Cement 
Co.), a member of the Administrative Reform Council, made the 
following remarks in this connection: "Zoku Dietmen form a group 
in each government ministry and agency to serve as a kind of 
protective body whose coalescence with administrative and 
financial officials is now being called into question. At that 
time, officials did not show up in the hearings, manipulated by 
the LDP zoku Dietmen. There is not this kind of resistance now 
because Japan has a coalition ruling camp at present." 
  Mr. Haruo Nishihara (former chairman of the Private 
Universities Association), a member of the Administrative Reform 
Council, also said as follows: "I heard that there was zoku 
Dietmen resistance in some [LDP] divisions, but the resistance 
was rather made by bureaucrats and the workers of respective 
special corporations. Those workers stressed that `our 
corporation is engaged in national programs, and so you should 
not pick us.' However, there came a change of government, and 
the Hosokawa cabinet was formed. The council intended to set 
about its task again in earnest, but there was not enough time 
with only three months left before the final report." 
  [Suzuki] I got many demerits for this; however, to make up 
for them I passed burdens to ministries and agencies concerned, 
asking them to study the directions given by the report and work 
out policies within the next two years with regard to all 92 
special corporations. I was obliged to take such a step, and as 
chairman, I feel great remorse for this really clumsy 
development. 
  Well, when I think cool-headedly, I feel that it is the 
Administrative Reform Council's system itself that is making 
administrative reform difficult. In carrying out administrative 
reform, the council has to make its proposals through the 
administrative organization, and efforts end in failure unless 
the proposals finally pass through meetings of administrative 
vice ministers at respective ministries and agencies. No single 
line provides for such a process in the Administrative Reform 
Council Installation Act, but the proposals cannot be presented 
even to the cabinet conference without the consent of all 
attending these meetings. 
  Officials participating in the proceedings have gained their 
rights and expanded their spheres of influence through longtime 
habits. They are not as large a family as one that was once 
formed around the former Japan Railway, but anyway they like 
measures to enlarge their power. On the other hand, they are 
opposed to curtailing their power through rationalization even 
if it is a good step for the nation. They consider only their 
rights. The most hateful thing for successive vice ministers and 
bureau directors was to see any of their sections pared down 
during their term of office. They feared that their careers 
might get hurt and their names remembered unfavorably because of 
such a measure. All this must be tided over in carrying out 
administrative reform; therefore, I cannot help saying that 
administrative reform is being carried out amid the 
self-contradiction contained in the system itself. 
  Administrative reform and political reform are so closely 
connected that they are frequently likened to a vehicle's two 
wheels, and I felt keenly that strong political power is 
necessary to make administrative reform really effective. The 
Japan Railway Corporation, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public 
Corp., and Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corp. were privatized 
when Mr. Doko led the Provisional Council for the Promotion of 
Administrative Reform. The steps were possible because Mr. Doko 
was great, but they were also possible because Prime Minister 
Nakasone stood firm. Bureaucrats hinted at their resignations to 
show their opposition, but the prime minister accepted all of 
their resignations without hesitation. This is how political 
power was used when the steps were taken. 
  Mr. Miyazawa, too, was eager for administrative reform. When 
we were tackling the special decentralization system (the pilot 
autonomous body system), he was thinking before I did about what 
my council should do, and it was rather me, not him, who was 
queried. He asked, "Mr. Suzuki, how will you handle such a 
case?" Mr. Miyazawa was a distinguished statesman, but he was 
not quite active in pushing things forward. That is his 
personality. 
  [SHUKAN GENDAI] A council member said as follows in this 
connection: "There was resistance from bureaucrats and zoku 
Dietmen, but another reason [for the failure of the final 
report] was that Mr. Miyazawa was not very eager for 
administrative reform. There was also concern among council 
members that if they put forward too ideal a plan, the chance 
for its realization would be small and so they gave 
consideration to producing a realizable plan." 
  [Suzuki] Administrative reform is carried out under a system 
with such self-contradiction. However, Japan's successive prime 
ministers were not accustomed to using a top-down approach based 
on leadership. For example, during the Gulf war, Japan could 
have shown a quicker response to the war if its politics had 
been oriented toward a top-down formula. It was not the prime 
minister alone that should be blamed for the delayed response. 
The delay took place because the entire Japanese politics was 
ruled by a bottom-up formula, a system in which decisions are 
made through a bottom-up process. 
  Consciousness reform has not yet been accomplished, and in 
this sense the work of decentralization will indeed be 
difficult. Centralized power politics does not accord with the 
current age. People talk about decentralization, but they do not 
cooperate once the actual work begins to promote it. When Mr. 
Hosokawa (the incumbent prime minister) was serving as chief of 
the "Affluent Life Division," the Administrative Reform Council 
proposed what was called the new basic autonomous body. The 
bottom lines of this basic autonomous body are that "local 
administration ought to be carried out by localities themselves" 
and that the main objects of local politics are problems closely 
connected with livelihood. Then the following question arises: 
Which should be chosen as basic autonomous bodies, the 
prefectures or the cities, towns, and villages? It is naturally 
cities, towns, and villages that are closely connected with 
livelihood. 
  However, there are now 3,300 cities, towns, and villages 
across the nation. Some autonomous bodies have populations of 
300 or less than 1,000. In such circumstances, it would be 
difficult to adequately carry out work for the residents' health 
and welfare. Therefore, the council began studying a plan to 
make the size of the basic autonomous body at least equal to the 
scale of the old han [a feudal domain] with a population of 
about 300,000. As soon as the study began, the heads of local 
autonomous bodies raised vehement opposition to merging towns 
and villages. Opposition was particularly fierce from 
prefectural governors although they should be in the position to 
promote decentralization. 
  After all, they intend to defend their spheres of influence. 
A village chief is a village chief, whether he is the chief of a 
large village or a village of 300 people. 
  Prefectural governors are essentially opposed to building 
cities designated by cabinet orders as well, on the grounds that 
the step decreases their power. 
<H5>  Abandon Control, Central Rule </H5>
  Why will such a thing happen? It is because while working, 
they hold a zero-sum game concept, a notion that when power is 
conferred upon one, someone else is losing an equal amount of 
power. Reform means building a new world, and so the central 
government should assume large strategic areas such as national 
defense, the stability of international money, and international 
contributions, while the prefectures carry out things necessary 
for the regional economy, entrusting practical issues closely 
connected with daily livelihood to cities, towns, and villages. 
Therefore, I would like to ask them to think with a plus-sum 
concept, not with a zero-sum concept. 
  In addition, local politics from now will find the need to 
adopt prefectural incorporation and the doshu system [doshu--a 
local administrative unit, wider than the prefectural area, now 
being conceived in a decentralization plan] because the 
prefecture alone is too narrow for carrying out local politics. 
Affairs to be handled by local politics should not be limited to 
those entrusted from the central organs. It should also study 
how to deal with education through the adoption of the doshu 
system and prefectural incorporation, whether it is good to 
continue the conventional uniform education enforced across the 
nation, and what industrial policies will be effective under the 
doshu system and prefectural incorporation. Some people may feel 
a fear as to giving greater power to the heads of local 
autonomous bodies because of the so-called general contractor 
scandal involving them. Therefore, lest a similar incident 
should occur again, my council recommended that cities, towns, 
and villages be made the center of the basic autonomous bodies, 
that budgets and competent workers be distributed to these 
areas, and that politics be carried out before the eyes of 
residents. Corruption without exception takes place in hidden 
places as seen in the Kyowa, Sagawa, and general contractor 
scandals. This is why it is necessary to promote basic 
autonomous bodies where residents can see politics before their 
eyes. 
  Japan has thus far carried out very good policies, but we 
are 
now in utterly different circumstances. We have brought about 
the second-largest economy in the world by striving to chase and 
outrun West Europe under the motto of building our nation 
through the increase of production. In doing so, we needed to 
make regulations and standards, develop people with equal 
ability, and carry out concentrated mass production. However, 
Japan's method of earning foreign money by mass-producing and 
exporting specific items was completely denied in the Japan-U.S. 
Structural Impediments Initiative talks as well. Japan has now 
reached a point where it has to make a great turnabout, because 
it can no longer bring up its next generation with its regulated 
society and centralization of power. It must decentralize itself 
by abandoning its central rule and make a great turnabout by 
taking the position of deregulation in principle and regulation 
as exceptional. 
  Political measures in this direction have actually been 
taken 
a little faster, but the real work is yet to be done with regard 
to various systems. It is the prime minister's job to translate 
our reports into action, and Prime Minister Hosokawa is indeed 
flexible like a lithe bomboo. If he had been like a pine tree, 
he would have already broken in half, but he always regains his 
original form like a bamboo tree. As for me, I believe I have 
run at full speed, and it is now the prime minister's turn to 
show the power of execution.

  [Text] The whole picture of draft economic-stimulus 
measures (comprehensive economic measures) to be announced by 
the government on 3 February was learned of on 31 January. The 
package includes expanded investment in public works, increased 
investment in housing construction, and the easier acquisition 
of land, with the scale of projects in these three areas alone 
exceeding 8 trillion yen (Y). 
  The government and the ruling coalition parties are now 
making final adjustments on the pending question of how large 
the cuts in income and residential taxes should be and where the 
revenues to cover the shortfalls arising therefrom should come 
from. They are seeking a conclusion on this by 2 February. As 
far as the question of whether to increase the consumption tax 
rate as a source of revenue is concerned, however, they plan to 
ask Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to make a political 
decision. With all the measures combined, the total package is 
likely to surpass Y14 trillion in scale, the largest ever in 
history. 
  The comprehensive economic package is in the process of 
being 
finalized under a schedule of the coalition parties announcing 
their proposal on the morning of 3 February and the government 
announcing its final proposal on the evening of the same day. 
The draft version of the announcement on the economic package 
says in its preface that the nation needs the greatest possible 
measures to put the chaotic economy back on track as quickly as 
possible in 1994. This is necessary for the country to attain 
stable growth in 1995 and thereafter, and to take up the midterm 
tasks in preparation for the advent of the aged-population 
society, it adds. 
  A main point of the package is that a total of Y4 trillion 
worth of projects -- including the advanced acquisition of 
public-use land -- will be undertaken to expand public works 
investments. These include Y2.9 trillion in public works 
projects and Y300 billion in independent regional projects. In 
the area of improving facilities, emphasis will be given to 
those related to education, research, medical care, and social 
welfare -- to attain an improvement in people's lives and the 
infrastructure for research and development. 
  With respect to the tax system concerning housing 
construction, whereas at present the housing loan tax applies to 
those earning more than Y20 million and building a house whose 
floor space exceeds 240 square meters, such a rule will be 
abolished over a certain period. In addition, to make land 
transactions easy, the "tax to promote the efficient use of 
land" will be introduced. Under the new taxation system, if 
someone who has owned land for more than five years wants to 
sell it for use in a good-cause project needed for the 
development of cities and towns, he can have his tax on transfer 
profits reduced to 20 percent (from the current 39 percent). In 
the case of corporations, an additional 10 percent in corporate 
taxes will no longer apply. 
  As for the efficient utilization of land, the package 
proposes appropriating additional project funds through 
establishing a special account for road construction and a 
special account for city development fund loans. It also 
proposes that the government pay interest on loans to buy land 
now owned by the Japan National Railway Settlement Corporation 
and to purchase farmland within city limits.

<F P=106> [Article by Yoshihiko Murayama, Towa Securities Research </F>
Institute: "From an Integrated Securities Approach to 
Specialization in Money Markets"] 
  [Text] Changes in the securities industry environment such 
as financial reform and the departure from the market of 
investors who have been pushed to the edge by the explosive drop 
in the stock market have severely exacerbated the earnings of 
the smaller securities companies. With their efforts at 
rationalization such as the closing of branches and forced 
reductions in personnel approaching the limit at this point, the 
author proposes specialization in money markets as a recipe for 
their survival. 
<H5>  Shedding Light--the Midyear Results </H5>
  We will focus our attention on the contents of the combined 
September 1993 midyear results for all securities companies. 
Although all companies showed increased earnings after a long 
dry spell, reflecting the impact of the temporary upturn in the 
stock market during April and May 1993, in contrast to the 
broad-based profitability of the four leading securities 
companies, the performance of the majority of medium-sized firms 
in terms of earnings was conspicuously dull, with continued red 
ink (see table). Particularly noticeable was the further trend 
in the expanding earnings differential between the four largest 
companies and the remaining ones, as might be expected from the 
size of the earnings bulge of the top four companies. 
  The primary reason for the upturn in earnings was an 
increase 
in commissions from stock trades. The four leading companies saw 
an increase of 151 percent over the same period a year ago while 
the second-tier companies experienced a growth of 140 percent. 
The four leaders solidly increased earnings commissions in bonds 
and underwriting, and bonds were the primary contributor to 
trading profits for the second-tier companies and below.

  On the other hand, retrenchment of administrative expenses 
such as the closing of branches and reductions in personnel 
remained at 0.3 percent for the four leading companies, but the 
average for the second-tier companies and below was 9.4 percent, 
with the bulk of their efforts going to rationalization. 
  Nonetheless, in addition to their using invested negotiable 
securities and latent real estate profits, found here and there 
among the second-tier and lower companies were lower required 
net-worth ratios as efforts at efficiency and rationalization 
extending over three years appeared to be pushing the limits of 
the old system. 
  The situation is serious because rationalization at this 
point will only make business retrenchment--that is, lower 
market share--increasingly inevitable. The issue then is that 
the future shape of the "securities markets" and the "securities 
industry" will not be visible at all without signs of a recovery 
being visible as in the past. Lacking a picture of the future, 
they face continued pressure on investment, expenses, and 
reductions in personnel. 
<H5>  Changes in the Securities Industry's Environment </H5>
  The explosive drop in the stock market that began in 1990 
can 
be explained as a phenomenon resulting from the bursting of the 
bubble economy. Without dwelling on the surface phenomena of 
"investors leaving the market," "stagnation in the stock 
underwriting market," and "worsened earnings by securities 
companies," which have been pointed out, the extended market 
stagnation caused by the plunge into a major economic slump 
following the collapse of the bubble seems to have given rise to 
qualitative changes in the basic structure of the stock market. 
  Furthermore, the entry of banks into the securities business 
through the reform of the financial system which began this year 
has begun to usher in momentous changes in the functions of the 
securities markets, as well as simply being threatening. 
  Environmental changes of this kind have been forcing 
fundamental changes in Japan's securities system since 1965 and 
appear especially to have shaken the operational base of the 
smaller securities companies. 
  How should the securities business respond to these changes? 
As the smaller securities firms look to their own well-being and 
strength, they worry about their next move, wondering what to do. 
  Changes in market structure caused by the extended 
securities 
slump are summarized in the following three points: 
  The first is the "affixing of a low relative weight to 
stocks 
in the securities markets." 
  By allowing only new listings in the stock underwriting 
market, market dullness invites a stop to capital expansion. 
Capital acquisition needs of corporations at present are being 
financed through bank loans and debt underwriting here and 
abroad. We see the underwriting of hybrid securities, including 
swaps. Furthermore, "stocks" are in disfavor in the application 
of capital, symbolizing the retreat of banks and business 
corporations from "financial engineering" investments. High-risk 
Japanese stocks are being avoided. 
  In this way, stocks apparently have lost the degree of 
importance they once had for capital acquisition and application 
and, with substitute vehicles appearing on the market, continue 
to be frozen in their present form. For Japanese securities 
companies, which grew up on stock trading, and especially the 
smaller securities companies whose very existence to a great 
degree is owed to stocks, the phenomenon of the "changes in 
mainstream trading vehicles" has to be termed revolutionary. 
  The second change could be summarized by the words "changes 
in investor structure." Changes in the structure of stock 
ownership, which started with the financial institutions, are 
steadily manifesting this impact in what has become a topic of 
daily conversation: "mutual dissolution." In what has become 
symbolic of the avoidance of "financial engineering," business 
corporations are increasingly distancing themselves from stocks, 
and "corporations" are now a major cause of the "sell" anxiety 
and are the reason for the gloomy market. 
  The "individual," who can substitute for the "corporation," 
in particular with "investments from household savings," calls 
attention to this. In Japan the "pure investment" institutional 
investors for investment trusts, annuities, and insurance, which 
ought to play the role of channel between the individual and the 
markets, are still weak. Household savings is an area that is 
still to be exploited. 
  In any event, although organizational investors play a role 
in this field as in Europe and the United States and are 
expected to be major players in the market, the fact that the 
investor structure continues to change means that the customer 
structure for securities will continue to change as well. 
  "Changes in investment philosophy and methodology" is the 
third change. The explosive drop in stock prices and the 
recession have again forced investors to recognize the 
importance of return on investment, of controlling risk, and of 
the efficacy of diversified investments. They have stimulated 
the development of new derivative investment approaches. 
Furthermore, emphasis is being placed on the importance of an 
infrastructure with analyst functions and research mechanisms to 
make it easier to put funds to work, which in turn has given 
rise to an opportunity for establishing evaluative mechanisms 
for investment performance. 
  Securities companies require superior talent and systems in 
order to cope with the development of these kinds of investment 
techniques. This demands that smaller securities firms make 
fresh investments. 
  Responding in concert and in step with the above market 
changes, the fact that various securities system reforms are 
being moved forward under authoritative leadership cannot be 
overlooked in considering the environment of the securities 
industry. Regarding this, reform to this point has had an 
especially large impact in the following three ways. 
1.% 

  1.%The entry of banks into the securities business. 
  2.%The equipping and activation of a debt market. 
  3.%The trend toward deregulation of commissions 
  As described above, with the current environment, which says 
that there must be a debt market in order for business financing 
not to be a function of the stock market, providing a favorable 
climate for bank-affiliated securities companies, beginning with 
the Industrial Bank of Japan, it is an extremely satisfactory 
beginning that bank-affiliated securities companies are 
reporting that they anticipate being in the black from the 
beginning of the fiscal year. 
  Furthermore, with the opportunity for entry into the 
management of debt underwriting by bank-affiliated securities 
companies or into acceptance groups, changes in the traditional 
syndication rules of the underwriting market will be inevitable. 
And there has been a trend toward a formula of acceptance by 
only a few leading securities companies. As a result, the 
scenario has manifested itself of shutting out lower-tier 
securities firms--being degraded to participating in selling 
groups--which is beginning to harm medium-sized securities 
companies. 
  Together with the anxiety that the trend toward a monopoly 
by 
the leading securities companies in this kind of underwriting 
market, starting with debt, will extend to stocks, it is feared 
that a cost differential in the purchasing of market instruments 
will emerge for midsized securities companies. 
  Whereupon, reform of the securities system itself will be 
largely toned down, with the brakes applied from the viewpoint 
of protecting the securities industry and with the 
intensification of the securities recession, by adopting such 
approaches as "bank-affiliated securities companies will not be 
permitted to transact [immediate] stocks" and "we will 
investigate the deregulation of commissions once we look into 
large transactions." These measures make the goals and ideals of 
basic system reform vague, but have the temporary effect of 
pacifying the tenacious victim mentality of the smaller 
securities companies regarding system reform. 
<H5>  Coping by the Smaller Securities Companies </H5>
  The changes in market structure accompanying the extended 
recession we have discussed thus far and the trend to system 
reform in response cannot halt this trend or turn the tide, even 
in the future when we see recovery from the depressed stock 
market. Rather we may need to consider that the part of the 
system frozen out by system reform will once again take 
possession. How are smaller securities companies to try to cope 
in the midst of this turmoil? 
  However you look at it, the trend now is to maintain 
efficiency and rationalization in order to eliminate losses. Key 
to rationalization is the closing of branches, reductions in 
personnel, postponing new investments, and use of latent 
profits. Included in this are home office transfers and 
campaigns for reduced overtime as steps to an increased 
drawdown. As a result, marketing costs for second-tier firms and 
below have been reduced by 27-31 percent and personnel by 26 
percent over a three-year period. For the midterm accounting 
period of September 1993, the reduction in marketing costs was 
9.4 percent and in personnel 10-13 percent. 
  However, despite these efforts, we find here and there 
securities companies with worsening net-worth ratios, who are 
consuming their latent profits, and unable to avoid losses. As 
discussed above, from this point on rationalization will 
accompany shrinkage in business scope and lower market share. 
All the more because the situation is so serious one has to 
wonder where will it all end. 
  For example, one must say that moves to make rapid changes 
in 
the character of companies in order for them to survive the 
trend in market changes are inadequate. The smaller securities 
firms have not trained people who either are able to deal with 
derivatives or are conversant with the debt market, and for this 
reason still need time and further investment. All companies 
would like forward-looking, "power up" investments of this sort, 
but the issue is one of a balance between this and the press of 
rationalization. Furthermore, some assert they are having 
difficulty setting goals, much less establishing a reform 
schedule. 
  A variety of opinions on all aspects are being offered these 
days to smaller securities firms groping for ways to survive in 
the changing financial environment. What these opinions all have 
in common is that these companies avoid an "integrated 
securities" syndrome, determine their own customer focus, and 
specialize in running individual operations. There are, in fact, 
two or three good examples of owner-run securities firms. While 
courageous talk is easy, in truth the going is probably pretty 
tough. 
  When we think about this based on the above trends, the 
results of system reform and internationalization, especially in 
the near future, I think we will see an era of international 
syndication ushered in, where, like London, Japan's underwriting 
market in stocks and debt will be hybrid. Players in this will 
be limited to those who employ talent and systems, namely the 
top-ranking securities firms turned investment banks, securities 
firms affiliated with the leading banks, and securities firms 
affiliated with overseas investors. The smaller securities 
companies fear being shut out of the underwriting market. 
  Should this happen, the smaller securities companies on 
their 
own will retreat from an "integrated securities approach," with 
the majority probably specializing in secondary markets. One can 
imagine that securities companies focusing on the secondary 
market will either take the form of U.S. discount brokers with 
large volume sales of securities to individuals and ordinary 
investors, or will specialize in developing investment advising 
with high added value aimed at special classes of customers. 
  The former are hoping for a large volume sales format 
despite 
a total deregulation of commissions, while the latter seek the 
format of investment adviser, having studied the successful 
earlier examples of the financial planner as exemplified by 
Merrill Lynch salesmen. But they will then be expected to be 
able to do commodity planning and development to meet customer 
needs with the know-how to put assets to work. 
  Furthermore, business diversity will be indispensable to 
ensure operational stability. First, deregulation of sideline 
businesses such as investment advising and investment trusts is 
to be expected, even if very small. Furthermore, relaxing the 
regulations on dealer positions may become an issue in promoting 
increased trading earnings as an earnings remedy. 
<H5>  Problems Remaining for the Future </H5>
  As market changes and reforms move forward, securities 
companies must accommodate this trend, preferably by thinking 
for the future. In order to do this, it will be necessary for 
underwriters, investors, market-affiliated people, and the 
authoritative leadership to join together early on, to lay out 
the future image of Japan's securities markets and to state it 
clearly and widely. Whereupon, should the picture that is laid 
out be overly severe for smaller securities firms, perhaps it 
would be best to consider a policy of additional time. A future 
image would better work as a guide on which to advance reform 
and rationalization among securities companies. Creation of such 
an image for the future is the number-one topic demanding 
attention. 
  It has been asserted that administration policy should shift 
from a business-oriented policy to a market-oriented one. I 
think that this administration policy as it should be is largely 
borne out by investigation. The most important facets to a 
securities policy are perhaps market regulation and protection 
of the investor. In this sense, the immediate subjects for 
deregulation are such things as deregulating the development of 
market instruments, deregulating sideline businesses, and 
relaxing rules governing dealer positions. In addition, in order 
to protect the investor, it may be necessary to set in place 
something like the U.S. SIPC (Securities Investors Protection 
Corporation).

Yoshikawa, from the "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series, on 
the Science and Technolgy Agency: "Problem With Policy on Atomic 
Energy"] 
  [Excerpt] Hearing with 'Fairness' in Mind [subhead] 
  On the morning of 3 December, Satsuki Eda, director general 
of the Science and Technology Agency [STA] who heads the Atomic 
Energy Commission [AEC], members of the AEC including Deputy 
Chairman Akira Oyama, Shoichiro Kobayashi, chairman of Kansai 
Electric Power Company, and Hiroto Ishida, director of the STA 
Atomic Energy Bureau, were gathered at a hotel in Tokyo. The 
occasion was to hold an "open hearing" on the atomic energy 
policy, and this was the first such experience for the 
commission. 
  The purpose of holding the open hearing was for the 
commission to listen to views from extensive sectors of the 
people including those who are opposed to the use of atomic 
energy, and thus to take wide-ranging views into the long-term 
programs which will become the foundation for the nation's 
atomic energy policy. The commission took caution to be "fair" 
by having a preparatory committee -- consisting of academics and 
specialists -- select the representatives to speak in the 
hearing. 
  The open hearing was held in acceptance of critical voices 
charging that the STA's "policies on atomic energy tend to be 
decided through maneuverings of officials behind the scenes." 
Director General Eda, since he was named to the post in August, 
has emphasized he will conduct "open atomic energy 
administration," and is known to have "instructed the officials 
to make open discussions possible." 
  What brought a change to the STA's atomic energy 
administration was the uproar over the shipment of plutonium in 
January 1993. When plutonimum was shipped in from France, the 
government tried to treat it as a secret, and hide, information 
on the navigation plan and timetable of the plutonimum carrier 
on the grounds of "needs to assure security" for it. But this 
caused complaints not only from antinuclear groups but also from 
the countries, waters of which the transport ship had to pass 
through. Plutonium is a substance extracted from spent fuel in 
atomic power stations, and the government thinks the substance 
will prove to be a long-term energy resource of dependable 
supply. But the uproar over the plutonium shipment in January 
was something that betrayed the government's expectations very 
much, and the incident has since turned into an issue which is 
likely to impact the fundamentals of the atomic energy 
administration of Japan. 
  That being the case, it can be said that a key to the 
success 
of future atomic enegy administration lies not only in whether 
the safety of atomic energy and plutonium can or cannot be 
assured but also in how well the government's intention to use 
it peacefully can be understood by the people of the nation and 
other countries. It was for this reason that Japan came to 
present its own proposal on international control of plutonium 
in September -- in beginning of the work to build up the 
atmosphere of the international community toward accepting 
peaceful use of the substance. 
  The allocation for atomic power projects in the STA budget 
is 
whopping, holding 55.6 percent of the total (in 1993) -- way 
over 27 percent assigned to space projects. The AEC's stand of 
rejecting "interferences" by any other offices has been a target 
of criticism. From the first day of its birth, the AEC has been 
chided as "a commission practicing Monroeism." Of course, 
Ishida, director of the agency's Atomic Energy Bureau, himself 
insists "Monroeism is no longer here." 
<H5>  In Charge of Science-Related Budget </H5>
  Lately, what has been growing in the agency is the work of 
coordinating policies on science and technology. The agency is 
acting as the government's traffic cop on research and 
development projects initiated by ministries and agencies under 
their jurisdiction. It is also helping in preparing the 
groundwork for research efforts and training personnel. 
  The STA holds legal power to regulate policies with regard 
to 
making estimates on science and technology-related expenses of 
the entire government. As such, it has the right to check the 
contents of budget demands of the government offices, but it 
does not try to exercise the right. A senior official of the STA 
Secretariat explained: "We do not want to invite complaints from 
other government offices by exercising the regulatory right. 
After all, their increases in science and technology budget 
contribute to promoting interests of the STA." 
  What the STA considers important is the Science and 
Technology Conference (chaired by Prime Minister Hosokwa) in 
which the STA and the Ministry of Education jointly serve as the 
secretariat. The conference is attended by ministers of science 
and technology-related offices. Projects supported by the 
conference are as good as having been approved by the government 
in fact. Preparing groundwork at the conference is important, 
and the conference is the arena where the STA carries out its 
function as a regulatory office. 
  One new task facing the STA is the preparation of the 
foundation for research projects that transcend borders of 
government offices. Kinju Atarashi, director of the agency's 
Science and Technology Promotion Bureau, said a "symbolic 
project" is the intra-ministry research information network 
being considered as a new project of 1994. Its aim is to 
connect the research information networks of all ministries and 
agencies, and to put the STA in charge of making budget demands 
on it. [passage on other functions of the agency omitted]

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 31 KYODO -- Senior trade negotiators 
from the so-called "quad" economic powers have reached a 
provisional agreement to establish the proposed World Trade 
Organization (WTO) on January 1, 1995, trade sources said Monday 
[31 January]. 
  The pact under the Uruguay round of multilateral trade 
talks, 
completed December 15, calls for the creation of a more powerful 
world trade watchdog by July 1, 1995. But its establishment has 
been quickened at the request of the secretariat of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  The United States and Canada have already accepted the 
request, while the European Union has indicated its approval. 
Japan has not lodged any objections to the idea. 
  The sources said the only uncertainty remains over the 
timing 
of the body's creation, despite the agreement between the four 
groups, because each of over 100 participating parties needs to 
ratify the proposal. 
  Also at the four-way talks, the U.S. urged Japan to reopen 
negotiations on proposals to scrap or reduce tariffs on four 
items. 
  The sources said Japan resisted U.S. pressure, citing the 
tariff problems already resolved at the Uruguay round of talks. 
But they said the U.S. is likely to restate its point when U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor arrives in Tokyo for trade 
talks Tuesday. 
  The U.S. has proposed ending tariffs on wood products, 
copper 
and white liquor and a tariff cut for leather products.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- A United Nations-sponsored 
meeting on population and development concluded Thursday [27 
January] with a declaration urging governments to curb 
population growth. 
  The two-day conference was held at the United Nations 
University in Tokyo. 
  "Population growth is a major obstacle to the alleviation of 
poverty, sustained socioeconomic development, and the 
improvement of the status of women," said the draft text of the 
Tokyo declaration of the meeting of eminent persons on 
population and development. 
  The meeting, also sponsored by the Foreign Ministry, was 
held 
in preparation for the International Conference on Population 
and Development (ICPD) slated for September in Cairo. 
  "We...call upon all governments and intergovernmental and 
nongovernmental organizations to do their utmost to make the 
(Cairo) conference a milestone in the global effort to eradicate 
poverty and socioeconomic inequality, to achieve sustained 
economic growth and sustainable development, to improve the 
status and role of women and to reduce population growth," it 
said. 
  The United Nations has predicted the world population, now 
at 
5.6 billion, will increase to 10 billion by 2050. 
  The declaration urged developing countries to integrate 
population issues into national development planning, and 
developed nations to change their patterns of consumption and to 
curb overproduction in order to reduce the impact on the 
environment and on the use of resources. 
  It also urged "the world community...to increase their 
financial commitment to population and related activities in 
developing countries in order to reach the estimated amount of 
approximately 13 billion dollars...by the year 2000 and 
approximately 17 billion dollars by the year 2015 annually." 
  At a news conference held immediately after the meeting 
ended, International Planned Parenthood Federation President 
Fred Sai, vice chairman of the Tokyo meeting, said, "one thing 
which has come out here...is that...we have to start addressing 
population issues much more seriously." 
  He said the other point stressed through the discussion was 
the importance of "partnership between the developed and 
developing countries." 
  The news conference was also attended by Nafis Sadik, 
executive director of the U.N. Population Fund, U.N. University 
Rector Heitor Gurgulino de Souza, Egypt's National Population 
Council Secretary General Maher Mahran [name as received] and 
former Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, chairman of the 
gathering. 
  The 14-member panel of the meeting debated sustainable 
development, family planning and the status of women in relation 
to population. 
  The panel also included former World Bank President Robert 
McNamara, former Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado 
and former Kiribati President Jeremia T. Tabai.

<F P=106> ["20,000 S. Koreans Protest Agricultural Market Opening" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- More than 20,000 
farmers and students of South Korea held a peasants' rally 
against the anti-national agricultural market opening by the Kim 
Yong-sam traitorous group at university quarters in Seoul on 
February 1, according to radio reports from Seoul. 
  Sponsored by nine peasants' organisations including the 
National Federation of Peasants Associations (Chonnong), the 
ralliers denounced with bitter indignation the treacherous crime 
of the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime in selling off the markets of 
rice and other agricultural products to the United States. 
  In the resolution adopted at the rally, they said if the 
agricultural market is opened, the South Korean agriculture will 
go totally bankrupt and urged the authorities to put the market 
opening issue to a referendum. And they demanded that the 
"National Assembly" refuse to "ratify" the treacherous 
agricultural market opening. 
  At the end of the rally, they went over to a demonstration, 
loudly shouting "oppose agricultural market opening " and 
marched toward the U.S. Embassy, clashing with a large police 
force. 
  While the demonstrators and police were engaged in a seasaw 
battle, some 500 students of the demonstrators marched toward 
"Chongwadae" [presidential offices]. 
  Synchronising with this protest in Seoul, as many as 200 
peasants of the North Cholla provincial branch of Chonnong 
headed for Seoul to join in it, while staging a demonstration on 
the Seoul-Pusan express highway. 
  Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition Democratic Party, 
called upon politicians and people to join hands in the struggle 
against agricultural market opening.

<F P=106> ["Papers on Kim Yong-sam Group's `Eradication of </F>
Irregularities'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
group set free under the name of stay of execution or parol, 
some politicians, "ranking government officials" and former 
generals of the puppet Army whom it had arrested on the charge 
of involvement in corruption and personnel irregularities in the 
puppet Army while making much ado under the "civilian" veil, as 
if it were doing a big thing. 
  This is a topic of press commentaries here today. 
  In a commentary titled "Arrest in Public and Release Through 
Back Door," NODONG SINMUN says: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam shouted himself hoarse about 
"reform" and "eradication of irregularities" under the 
"civilian" veil. This was, however, no more than a 
popularity-hunting tactics to improve his public image and a 
base "political retaliation" to revenge himself on political 
forces that had laid obstacles to his seizure of power and 
remove them from the political scene. 
  Whenever the rulers changed in South Korea, a loud 
advertizement was made about the "uprooting of irregularities," 
but it got nowhere anytime. [sentence as received] 
  If there was anything different in case of the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, it was the greater pomp in the advertizement about 
"eradication". But it has turned out to have been an empty 
slogan as he set free the criminals. 
  It is an unpardonable crime of the traitor Kim Yong-sam to 
have fooled the popular masses with the signboard "uprooting of 
irregularities." 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam is stringing out a high-flown 
jargon 
to appear "upright." But he is the chieftain of irregularities 
and the target of overthrow. 
  The traitor is not "liquidating irregularities" but 
persecuting and arresting people of conscience who exposed them. 
  Noting that the Kim Yong-sam group released the criminals 
who 
had been prosecuted under arrest on the charge of bribe taking 
and irregularities in personnel affairs of the Army in less than 
one year, MINJU CHOSON says: This shows that the puppets' 
patronage of the suspects of irregularities has entered an open 
stage.

<F P=106> ["Right Way of Building New Asia"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 1 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
signed article today calls upon the Asian people to build a 
prosperous new Asia by expanding and developing South-South 
cooperation. 
  The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as 
saying: 
  "If the people of the Asian countries unite on the basis of 
independence and expand and develop South-South cooperation on 
the principle of collective self-reliance, they will be able to 
build a new, independent and prosperous Asia free from 
domination and subjugation." 
  Pointing out that it is the common cause of the Asian people 
to build an independent and prosperous new Asia freed from 
domination and subordination, the article says: 
  A right way of accomplishing this cause lies in that the 
Asian people unite on the basis of independence and expand and 
develop South-South cooperation on the principle of collective 
self-reliance. 
  Just as the Asian people are the masters of Asia, the 
building of a new Asia lies with the Asian people themselves. 
  The present situation requires the Asian people more 
urgently 
than ever to hew out the future of Asia as its masters in an 
independent way. 
  For the Asian people to unite on the basis of independence 
and expand and develop South-South cooperation is all the more 
urgent as the regionalization and bloc of the economy is being 
promoted in the world. 
  Only when they unite with each other and expand and promote 
economic exchange and cooperation can the Asian people push 
ahead with the building of a prosperous new Asia, winning in the 
fierce international economic trade competition. 
  They have full conditions and potentiality to develop 
South-South cooperation. 
  What is important is that all the Asian countries should 
cooperate with each other for common prosperity without 
selfishness. 
  It is necessary for them to firmly unite and actively 
cooperate with each other for the common cause, respecting and 
exchanging experiences on the principle of genuine independence, 
equality and mutual benefits. 
  If all the Asian people tap favourable conditions and rich 
potentials to the full by developing South-South cooperation in 
unity, they can bring about a rapid development of Asia and 
successfully build a new Asia of coprosperity. 
  It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to strive to expand 
and develop South-South cooperation, stresses the article.

Because our party has regarded the chuche-oriented

displaying the pride of being an invincible revolutionary party.

  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: The 
chuche-oriented party-building theory is the completed party 
building doctrine for the working class of our era. 
  Above all, the chuche-oriented party-building theory clearly 
elucidates the road to party building based on the unitary 
ideological system. Building the party based on the unitary 
ideological system is a basic principle for party building. 
  The party's unitary ideological system is the leader's 
[suryong] ideological system and leadership system. The working 
class' party is the vanguard unit of the working class and the 
working popular masses, who are organizationally and 
ideologically rallied around the leader [suryong]. The mission 
of the working class party lies in implementing the leader's 
[suryong] ideology and leadership and in leading the working 
popular masses to realize their independence. 
  For this reason, to discharge its missions as a political 
weapon for achieving the leader's [suryong] ideology and 
leadership, the party must establish the leader's [suryong] 
ideological and leadership system. 
  Only when the party's unitary ideological system is 
established can the entire party be armed with the leader's 
[suryong] ideology; can it move as one under the leader's 
[suryong] unitary leadership; and can it thoroughly realize the 
leader's [suryong] leadership for the whole society. 
  Also, the chuche-oriented party-building theory most clearly 
elucidates the road to masses-oriented party building. Building 
the party into a masses-oriented party is a basic policy in 
party building. 
  In the past period, the party has been regarded as the 
class-oriented political organization and as the weapon for 
class struggle, which represented and defended the class 
interests. The party is the class' vanguard unit which 
struggles to meet the demand and interests of a certain class. 
However, if the party is built into the party only for certain 
class' interests, it cannot fully discharge its duty as the 
revolutionary party and cannot enjoy the support of the broad 
segments of the masses. 
  Our era's historical conditions, in which the broad segments 
of popular masses emerged as the masters of their fate, demand 
that the working class' party be built into the party which 
represents the interests of the entire people and includes the 
leading elements of all working class circles. In the socialist 
society where the masses of all walks of life are turned into 
the socialist working people and where the social class 
composition is unified, building the working class's party into 
the masses-oriented party emerges as an urgent demand. 
  By scientifically penetrating our era's demands and our 
revolution's concrete reality and by putting forward the masses- 
oriented party-building theory, our party has opened a new road 
for revolutionary party building. 
  The masses-oriented party-building theory, which our party 
has put forth, is based on the chuche-oriented revolutionary 
principle that the masters of revolution and construction are 
the popular masses and that the might for promoting revolution 
and construction lies in the popular masses. 
  The socialist cause is preciously the popular masses' cause. 
Today, with socialism the desire of broad segments of the 
popular masses and the social class' foundation for socialism 
greatly expanded, the party struggling for the socialist cause 
should be built into the masses-oriented party which represents 
the interests of the entire popular masses and takes its root in 
the broad segments of the working popular masses. 
  Our party has been the strong bastion of the revolution 
because our party has been strengthened and developed into an 
invincible revolutionary party that enjoys the popular masses' 
absolute support and trust and because our party has been 
combined into one socio-political lifeline in which the party 
and the masses share the same fate of life or death. This is 
the brilliant fruition of the masses-oriented party-building 
line and the firm guarantee for our victory. 
  The chuche-oriented party-building theory has correctly 
elucidated the road for building a militant party characterized 
by strong organization and discipline. Revolutionary 
organization and discipline are the life of the working class 
party. 
  The working class party is the revolutionary general staff 
that breaks through the numerous ordeals and tribulations to 
organize and lead revolutionary struggle and construction work. 
In a nutshell, the working class party should not be a group 
which lacks standards and discipline but be a combat unit 
characterized by strong organization and discipline. 
  Based on the party's firmly established unitary ideology 
system, our party has correctly embodied the 
democratic-centralistic principle; has strengthened and 
developed the party members' life and the party's organization 
and discipline; and, thereby, has been strengthened and 
developed into an invincible revolutionary party with strong 
organization and discipline in which the whole party moves as 
one under the leader's [suryong] unitary leadership. 
  The chuche-oriented party-building theory is a valuable 
guideline capable of thoroughly embodying the basic 
party-building principle on basically adhering to the work 
conducted with people. The chuche-oriented party-building 
theory on basically adhering to the work conducted with people 
is based on the theory of the chuche idea. 
  Because the main forces for promoting revolution and 
construction are people, the working class party should resolve 
all issues arising in party construction and activities through 
the work conducted with people. 
  Our party has always given priority to the ideological 
indoctrination work of party members and working people, that 
is, the work conducted with people. By so doing, our party has 
greatly strengthened the main forces of the revolution and 
vigorously accelerated revolution and construction. 
  The chuche-oriented party-building theory has elucidated the 
correct road to most brilliantly implement the party's political 
leadership for revolution and construction. Firmly implementing 
the political leadership for society is the basic mission of the 
working class party. In a socialist society, the mission of the 
working class revolutionary party is to responsibly lead the 
people's fate and to provide them with an independent and 
creative life. 
  To discharge its missions, the party should firmly realize 
the political leadership in all national fields, including 
politics, economy, culture, and national defense. The party's 
responsibility and its leadership for the people's fate can 
never be separated. 
  Enhancing the party's leadership and role in order to firmly 
realize the political leadership for the whole society is the 
basic direction in building the socialist ruling party. For the 
first time, the chuche-oriented party-building theory fully 
elucidates the essence, principle, and method of the party's 
leadership for revolution and construction. 
  Our party has regulated party leadership for revolution and 
construction as the political guidance, that is, guidance based 
on politics, and has thoroughly checked the tendency for 
political guidance to fall into administrative ruts. Our party 
has thoroughly embodied the basic principle by raising it as the 
basic principle to combine the party's unitary leadership into 
the revolutionary masses-oriented line, thus correctly combining 
leadership with the masses and constantly enhancing the party's 
leadership role. 
  Our party has regulated a party committee as the supreme 
guidance organization of the units concerned and has guaranteed 
collective guidance in the party committee's activities. By so 
doing, our party has correctly combined the unity of the 
political leadership into the masses' initiative. By closely 
combining the party's work into the administrative and economic 
work, our party has strengthened the main forces of the 
revolution and vigorously accelerated socialist construction. 
  The chuche-oriented party-building theory is a powerful 
weapon capable of firmly establishing the revolutionary work 
method and people-minded work style in keeping with the inherent 
demand of the working class party. The issue concerning work 
method and style is one of the basic issues determining the 
success in strengthening the main forces of revolution and 
organizing and mobilizing the popular masses into the 
revolutionary struggle. 
  In the whole process of the party building, our party has 
adhered to the chuche-oriented party-building theory, has 
constantly struggled to improve the party's work method and 
style, and has thereby fully established the revolutionary work 
method and people-minded work style in the whole party based on 
the revolutionary masses-oriented line. 
  Our party's work method is the anti-Japanese guerrilla work 
method that the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song created early 
on amidst the flames of the anti-Japanese revolutionary 
struggle. The Chongsan-ri method and Chongsan-ri spirit were 
deepened and developed in keeping with the realistic demand for 
socialist construction to become our party's work method. In a 
word, our party's work method is a work method in the manner of 
the great leader [suryong]. 
  Our party's work method is the most revolutionary and 
people- 
minded work method and style, which strengthens the 
single-hearted unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and 
the masses by closely combining the leadership with the masses 
and which brings the creation of the masses into full play. 
  Our party has put forward the slogan, "Serve the people," 
and led all functionaries to faithfully work for the people. 
By so doing, our party has thoroughly strengthened 
single-hearted unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and 
the masses to bring the unfathomable strength of the popular 
masses into full play. 
  The chuche-oriented party-building theory fully elucidates 
the issue of firmly guaranteeing continuity in party building. 
Firmly guaranteeing continuity in party building is the most 
basic issue that arises in carrying out the party's cause and 
the working class' revolutionary cause. Because the working 
class' revolutionary cause is a protracted cause which should be 
conducted generation after generation, the cause of the working 
class party-building cause should be inherited generation after 
generation. 
  The frustration of socialism in various countries in the 
world is a bitter lesson that if the working class party is not 
strengthened and developed generation after generation, the 
revolution is forced to undergo hardship and be stopped halfway. 
Based on the legitimate demand for developing the revolution in 
our era and on the historical lesson of the international 
communist movement, our party has raised the issue of inheriting 
the party's leadership as the most important issue arising in 
the completion of the working class revolutionary cause 
generation after generation. Our party has brilliantly resolved 
the issue theoretically and practically. 
  As a result, a firm guarantee for completing the 
chuche-oriented revolutionary cause generation after generation 
can be secured in our country. This is the greatest victory 
which our party has gained in the process of embodying the 
chuche-oriented party-building theory. 
  Indeed, chuche-oriented party-building theory is the most 
correct guideline and completed theory which elucidates the 
future road for working class party building in our era. 
  We should take pride and confidence in having the most 
complete chuche-oriented party-building theory that was created 
by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and inherited and 
developed by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. By 
thoroughly embodying the chuche-oriented party-building theory, 
we should further strengthen and develop our party into an 
ever-victorious and invincible party.

<F P=106> [Report on a meeting to mark the 64th CPV anniversary in </F>
Hanoi on 2 February -- passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Dear friends: This morning, 2 February, the Hanoi 
party committee, people's committee, and fatherland front held a 
solemn meeting to mark the 64th anniversary of the Communist 
Party of Vietnam [CPV] -- 3 February 1930 to 3 February 1994 -- 
at the Vietsov Friendship Cultural Palace in an atmosphere 
welcoming the New Year and the success of the Midterm National 
Party Conference [MNPC]. 
  Attending the meeting were CPV Advisers Pham Van Dong and Vo 
Chi Cong, Le Duc Anh, Vo Van Kiet, Nong Duc Manh, Nguyen Duc 
Binh, General Vo Nguyen Giap, many high-level party and 
government cadres, and representatives of all central and Hanoi 
sectors and departments. Comrade Pham The Duyet, member of the 
CPV Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the 
Hanoi party committee, delivered a speech recalling the glorious 
tradition of our party in the past 64 years. He said: 
  "Right from its birth, our party firmly held the 
revolutionary banner and outlined a correct platform to widely 
gather and unite people from all walks of life and lead them to 
the victory of the August Revolution, establishing the first 
worker-peasant government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam 
in Southeast Asia. 
  "Then the party successfully led a nine-year resistance war 
against the French colonialists, opening an era of the 
disintegration of the Old Colonialist System in the world. 
After the Geneva Agreement in 1954, the party led our people to 
hold high the banner of national independence and socialism to 
simultaneously carry out the two revolutions: the socialist 
revolution in North Vietnam and the national democratic 
revolution in South Vietnam for the national unification. 
  "That correct line became the revolutionary action of our 
people. It led our people to the great victory in 1975, 
liberating South Vietnam and unifying our nation for the whole 
country to move forward to socialism. 
  "In the socialist revolution, our party has exerted many 
efforts to study, search, and invent for the outlining of 
correct socialist lines, goals, and directions. Sometimes it 
committed mistakes. Our party seriously criticized itself and 
initiated and led a national renovation undertaking in all 
social aspects at the Sixth National CPV Congress. The Seventh 
National CPV Congress developed the Sixth National CPV 
Congress's renovation line to continue taking the renovation 
undertaking into new depths. 
  "The result of the implementation of the Seventh National 
CPV 
Congress resolution was evaluated at the recent MNPC. The 
conference confirmed that we have scored very important 
achievements. The great achievement with a paramount meaning is 
the overcoming in an important step our socioeconomic crisis. 
Three years on the road, our economy scored a fairly good 
developing rates. The average annual development rate was 7.2 
percent. Inflation, from two digits in earlier years, reduced 
to 5.2 percent in 1993. The life of major part of the people has 
been stabilized and partly improved. Those achievements have 
positively contributed to the firm maintenance and consolidation 
of political stabilization, a necessary condition for national 
construction and development. 
  "In recent years, due to the successful renovation and the 
broadening of our external relations, our reputation and 
position of our country in the world has been improved, creating 
favorable conditions for the national construction and 
protection." 
  The Hanoi party committee secretary confirmed that the 
aforementioned great achievements have created a premise for our 
country to move to a new developing era, an era for the first 
step of the national industrialization and modernization. After 
confirming the achievements recorded by the Hanoi party 
committee and people in the past year, Comrade Pham The Duyet 
stressed: 
  "With its role and position outlined at the Six National 
Party Congress, the Hanoi party committee has actively led the 
people in the implementation of the renovation undertaking. The 
recent 11th Hanoi party committee meeting unanimously evaluated 
and found that in 1993, under the party and government 
leadership, the Hanoi people have recorded great achievements. 
That is the maintenance of political security and social order. 
The economy continued to score new achievements with fairly 
good development rates. Its gross domestic product increased 
11.2 percent over 1992. Nearly 30,000 new jobs were created. 
The Hanoi average production per head increased from $517 in 
1992 to $565 in 1993. Hanoi industrial production reached its 
highest level so far. Education and training service; cultural, 
arts, physical education, and sports activities; public health 
care; and other social welfare service achieved prominent 
progress compared to the previous years. Hanoi party and 
government and mass organizations widely expanded many public 
movements for the implementation of political, economic, and 
social duties in the past year." 
  Comrade Pham The Duyet pointed out the strengths and 
weaknesses in socioeconomic development scored by the Hanoi 
party and people in the past and stressed party building work. 
He said: 
  "The Hanoi and local party committee accelerated their 
leadership, considering the party renovation and rectification 
an important task for 1993. They implemented suitable steps and 
measures and reviewed their work regularly to learn from 
experiences in wards, villages, state enterprises, colleges, and 
so forth. 
  "Party building, renovation, and rectification work, 
however, 
still bears many shortcomings. Many problems have not been 
solved adequately. Various party organizations especially still 
are confused in their leadership content and method. Cadre 
planning and training was carried out, but did not receive 
appropriate attention and investment. 
  "Our party tirelessly has struggled, explored, and 
innovated, 
thus achieving great and glorious victories throughout the 64 
years of its history." 
  The Hanoi party committee secretary then outlined the 
socioeconomic targets that set forth by the Hanoi party 
committee for 1994. He also reasserted the determination of the 
Hanoi party organization and people to bring the MNPC resolution 
to reality and to fulfill all socioeconomic targets. In his 
conclusion, Comrade Pham The Duyet said: 
  "In developing our party's glorious revolution traditions, 
the Hanoi party organization and people pledge to closely unite 
around the party Central Committee led by our beloved Comrade 
General Secretary Do Muoi, to continue our renovation 
undertaking, to advance further in the industrialization and 
modernization process, to fulfill the socioeconomic targets set 
forth by the Seventh Party Congress, and to make Hanoi become 
evermore prosperous and civilized on the socialist path, 
deserving the trust of the people in Hanoi and in the entire 
country. We will greet the 40th anniversary of the liberation 
of Hanoi and other national holidays in 1994-95 with practical 
action."

  [Text] Recently, (Misac), a former French minister, came 
to Phnom Penh and went around asking about the so-called 
successor to His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. 
  (Misac)'s activity can be compared to a merchant getting 
ready to buy a tiger's hide. This is France's policy and 
preparation for Cambodia in line with its obsolete colonialist 
system. 
  During this trip to sound out the opinion on this important 
issue, (Misac) received answers from various sources as follows: 
  First opinion: The persons qualified to succeed his majesty 
are members of the Duang Dynasty's Norodom and Sisowat lines, 
such as His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, Norodom Chakkrapong, HRH Prince Kromluong Yuveakneat, 
and Prince Norodom Sihamoni. 
  Second opinion: The Vietnamese communists and their puppets 
want Norodom Chakkrapong to succeed His Majesty Norodom 
Sihanouk. They have also put Chea Sim's name on the list to 
succeed his majesty, saying that Chea Sim has been given a royal 
title. He has ordered the masses and government officials to 
use royal language when addressing him and to call his wife the 
royal consort. 
  The people in Phnom Penh ridiculed traitor Chea Sim, 
likening 
him to the lizard with a golden ring. They asked, who asked 
(Misac) to come to Phnom Penh to arrange an heir to His Majesty 
King Norodom Sihanouk's throne -- the outstanding leader and 
father of the nation, of national reconciliation, and of peace 
-- who is respected and loved by the entire nation? 
  The Cambodian nation and people asked, who wanted this man 
to 
raise the question of reigning on the throne in the current 
Cambodian situation when the nation and people are suffering 
from great and most serious misery due to both national and 
social problems and despite the fact that His Majesty King 
Norodom Sihanouk still continues as the esteemed and beloved 
outstanding leader of the nation and people? 
  The nation and people also expressed anger with the 
Vietnamese communists and their puppets for trying to elevate 
the traitorous clique, their out-and-out flunky to the throne in 
Cambodia. 
  His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk has stated clearly that the 
reigning king must have good quality and virtue and always be 
concerned about the national and people's interests and the 
national unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of 
Cambodia. The entire Cambodian nation and people are in unity 
with His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk. Therefore, France, the 
Vietnamese communists, or any other foreigners have no right to 
arrange any successor to the throne for serving them and 
destroying the Cambodian nation and people.

  [Excerpt] During a meeting with the Canadian envoy in Phnom 
Penh on 29 January, the puppet Chea Sim declared his vehement 
opposition to national reconciliation. He demanded that 
Democratic Kampuchea implement his three conditions before any 
other issue is discussed. This declaration clearly proves that 
the Vietnamese communist puppets -- on orders from their bosses 
-- do not accept His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point 
political plan to secure national reconciliation and genuine 
peace in Cambodia. [passage omitted]

  [Summary] Phnom Penh 2 Feb (AKP) -- According to the local 
agriculture service, Kandal Province could face a shortage of 
34,530 tonnes of foodstuffs in 1994 with the production of the 
past rainy season and the current dry season reaching only 
176,200 tonnes. This is not enough to meet the needs of the 
851,620 persons living in the province. 
  Only four districts -- Phnum Penh, Kandal Stoeng, S'ang, and 
Ponhea Loe -- possess favorable conditions for growing rainy 
season rice while land in other districts along the Mekong river 
is reserved for growing dry season rice and subsidiary crops. 
The province transplanted only 45,230 hectares of assorted 
varieties of rice with an average yield of a tonne and a half 
per hectare in the past rainy season. So far the province has 
planted more than 12,300 hectares of fast-growing rice, or 25 
percent of the plan.

  [Text] President Ramos has directed the Department of 
Interior and Local Government to conduct an intensive manhunt 
for members of the Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB] responsible for 
bombings of the offices of Petron, Caltex and Shell. The 
Philippine National Police is undertaking several security 
measures to prevent the repetition of yesterday's bombings. 
  President Ramos has also ordered more police visibility in 
strategic locations following the bombings by communist rebels. 
He appealed to the people to stay calm as the national police 
and the Armed Forces of the Philippines are tracking down the 
bombers. The president was airborne on his way to Calaban, 
Mindoro, when the three bombs exploded. The taxi driver hired 
by the suspects was picked up by the police shortly after the 
explosions in Makati. He is now undergoing interrogation to 
help probers identify the bombers. 
  Press Secretary Jess [Jesus] Sison said the violence being 
perpetrated by the ABB will worsen the situation and may affect 
the peace process. Sison urged the people to remain calm and to 
bring their complaints to the proper authorities and through 
legal means. Earlier, the ABB claimed responsibility for the 
bombings of the oil companies' offices. 
  Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief General Lisandro 
Abadia 
said that the military will fully support the national police in 
its efforts to capture the bombers. Abadia said the armed 
forces will not tolerate and allow these lawless elements to sow 
terror among the public. The armed forces chief said that the 
public should not be unduly alarmed by these attacks as the 
military is conducting normal security measures to prevent its 
repetition. 
  Meantime, Energy Secretary Delfin Lazaro has assured that 
adequate military measures are in place on vital facilities of 
National Power Corporation, Philippine National Oil Company and 
the Energy Regulatory Board. Lazaro said strict security is 
being implemented in all energy offices to ensure adequate 
protection for every official. 
  Police and the military are now under red alert following 
yesterday's bombings of the offices of three oil companies. The 
Philippine National Police has put into effect Oplan [operation 
plan] Lawaan, in anticipation of several unrests over the oil 
price increase. [Interior Secretary] Alunan said the violence 
could send wrong signals to foreign investors.

  [Text] More raids against companies suspected of selling 
and using illegal software will be enforced in the coming weeks 
and throughout the year by the Business Software Alliance (BSA), 
a coalition of the world's leading software publishers. 
  "These businesses should be aware that dealing in infringing 
software is a serious crime in the Philippines and no effort 
will be spared in tracking down firms that sell our members' 
products without authorization," BSA Vice President Ron Eckstrom 
told reporters yesterday. BSA investigators along with the 
Philippine National Police began the raids last year. Their 
first casualties were four retail outlets of Brochiere, a 
leading computer and software retailer in the country. Seized 
were some 4,000 floppy diskettes and 25 hard disks containing 
suspected illegal software published by BSA members Lotus and 
Microsoft. Eckstrom pointed out that Brochiere was merely one of 
the many retail firms in the country that openly disregard the 
law. 
  He added that the BSA will urge the courts to impose the 
most 
severe penalties available under the law against any firm found 
guilty of software piracy.

  [Text] Thailand has protested the American sale of 10,000 
tons of high-grade rice at a low subsidised price to Cote 
d'Ivoire because it adversely impacts Thailand's rice market. 
  A Commerce Ministry source said M.R. Napthon Thongyai of the 
Commercial Counsellor's Office in Washington wrote to the US 
State Department opposing the $5-million sale. Under a special 
assistance programme, the payment period will be 30 years with a 
grace period of seven years at no interest. 
  Last November, the US sold 35,000 tons of rice worth $10 
million to the African nation under the same programme that did 
not adversely impact the Thai rice market because that sale was 
of a lower-quality rice, the source said. Cote d'Ivoire imported 
200,400 tons of rice from Thailand in 1992 and anticipates 
imports of 215,000 tons this year.

  [Text] Thailand and Argentina agreed to increase bilateral 
relations on economics, trade and investment and target to boost 
trading volume this year, according to a Foreign Ministry press 
statement released yesterday. 
  The 1994 target was set at US$100-200 million per year from 
the current record of US$66 million, during the discussion held 
last Friday between visiting Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri 
and Argentine Acting Foreign Minister Armando Caro, the 
statement said. Thailand's imports from Argentina include 
cotton, steel, aluminium, computer hardware and military goods 
while exports are cloths, textiles, furniture and gems. 
  During the meeting, the Thai side also proposed to form a 
mechanism to provide regular consultations between high-level 
officials of the two countries and exchanges of trade 
representatives and diplomatic officials, said the statement. 
  In a separate discussion with Deputy Foreign Minister 
Ferdinand Enrique Petrella, Argentina briefed Sqn Ldr [Squadron 
Leader] Prasong on the Falklands dispute which escalated into a 
war between Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1981. Both sides 
exchanged opinions on various issues such as the negotiations of 
the Uruguay Round's General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, the 
cooperation under the Cairns group, the Nuclear Non- 
Proliferation Treaty, and the activities of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation, the statement added.

  [Excerpt] Despite reports of deepening differences between 
the Phalang Tham Party [PDP] and the Democrats over policy, 
Deputy Premier Bunchu Rotchanasathian says the perception of 
rifts in the Government is mistaken, and the real problem is 
with the bureaucracy which implements the policy. Even though 
there were reports of conflicts, relations in the Cabinet have 
always been good, said Mr Bunchu in an interview with the 
BANGKOK POST. 
  The Phalang Tham leader's optimism is in stark contrast to 
ongoing heated debate on his party's drive for the election of 
provincial governors which, observers say, could seriously 
threaten the unity of the Chuan Likphai coalition government. 
  Prime Minister Chuan last week invited leaders and 
secretaries-general of coalition parties to a meeting as the 
debate heated up. Mr Bunchu said the purpose of the meeting was 
not to reduce conflicts among coalition parties as reported. 
Instead the leaders discussed ways to convey to the public an 
understanding that all coalition members are on good terms. 
  Coalition conflicts over decentralisation policy, if 
escalated, could make a recent prediction on Phalang Tham's 
future in the coalition come true. Political activist and 
university lecturer Thirayut Bunmi predicted that a government 
crisis may arise between the PDP and other coalition parties 
this year over either the governor election proposal or traffic 
problems. And as a result the PDP may decide to leave the 
coalition. 
  Mr Bunchu dismissed the prediction. Mr Thirayut's analysis, 
he said, was based on inaccurate assumptions. "He has to make 
more clarifications on what would be the causes and conditions 
under which Phalang Tham could no longer stay in the 
Government." He says his party has not changed its policy on 
decentralisation of government. It has called for direct 
election of provincial governors -- the same system now used in 
Bangkok. But the party has to accept the Government's 
decentralisation policy which is stated more loosely, because it 
was in the minority when the policy was drawn up, he said. 
  Even though the party was not satisfied with that, it had to 
accept the policy because it was collectively decided. Mr 
Bunchu said he had tried to explain to party members that 
Phalang Tham policy and that of the Government still share the 
same goal of decentralising power. The Deputy Premier also said 
delay in implementation of the policy is caused by the Interior 
Ministry, which was assigned to carry it out. This has led 
people to think that the Government is not sincere in carrying 
out its plan for decentralisation. 
  "People have got the wrong impression that one coalition 
party wants decentralisation while another stalls. This is not 
true. Bureaucratic mechanisms are necessary for implementation 
(of the policy)," he said. The Interior Ministry, he said, has 
been told to speed up implementation. [passage omitted]

  [Begin Yiapaoheu recording] The Lao National Assembly 
delegation and the Thai parliamentary delegation held a meeting 
at 1450 in the National Assembly auditorium. During the 
meeting, Chairman Saman Vi-gnaket welcomed the Thai delegation's 
official visit. He highly assessed the visit and noted that it 
will contribute to promoting and expanding the long-standing and 
traditional relations of friendship and cooperation between the 
two peoples of Laos and Thailand. Chairman Saman Vi-gnaket also 
briefed the Thai side on the general situation in the LPDR. He 
emphasized the National Assembly's organizational work and 
activities, especially the establishment and enforcement of the 
Constitution and various laws aimed at guaranteeing Lao citizens 
from all tribes their democratic rights, freedoms, and rights as 
masters. In addition, Chairman Saman Vi-gnaket briefed the Thai 
side on the National Assembly's functions, structure, and 
activities. He also gave his views on the LPDR's determination 
to implement the policy of peace, friendship, and cooperation. 
In this regard, he said the LPDR and the multiethnic Lao people 
always seek friendship with all neighboring countries as well as 
various friendly countries throughout the world, both near and 
far. In addition, Chairman Saman Vi-gnaket expressed his 
satisfaction with the friendly relations between the LPDR 
National Assembly and the Parliament of the Kingdom of Thailand. 
  For his part, Prof. Marut Bunnak expressed his pleasure with 
the welcome accorded to the Thai delegation by the Lao side. He 
then reiterated the time-honored and traditional relations of 
friendship and cooperation between the peoples of the two 
countries. He noted that Laos and Thailand are two neighboring 
and fraternal countries that maintain similar customs and 
languages. He continued, saying that as representatives that 
have worked for the interests of the people and the nation, the 
delegation will contribute positively and more effectively to 
boosting the activities of the two countries' assemblies. In 
conclusion, the two sides agreed to strengthen mutual relations 
between the two countries' assemblies through various forms and 
means, such as exchanging visits between delegations at various 
levels. In this regard, the two sides agreed to set up a 
friendship association between the LPDR National Assembly and 
the Parliament of the Kingdom of Thailand to enhance friendly 
relations between the Lao and Thai peoples. 
  In addition, the Lao side reiterated the settlement of 
border 
problems and the problem of those ill-intentioned elements that 
have hidden in Thailand and created obstacles to friendly 
relations between the peoples of the two countries. The two 
sides agreed to make efforts to promote and improve friendly 
relations and expand the roles of the legislative institutions 
in order to contribute to strengthening Lao-Thai relations and 
cooperation during the next stage. [end recording] [passage

<F P=106> [Speech by Marut Bunnak, president of the Thai Parliament </F>
and speaker of the House of Representatives, at a banquet in 
Vientiane on 1 February -- recorded, in Thai] 
  [Text] I would like to thank Your Excellency Saman 
Vi-gnaket as well as the Lao National Assembly, Government, and 
people for giving me and my party an honorable and warm welcome 
from the moment we set foot on this land. 
  Laos and Thailand have maintained close and brotherly 
relations since ancient times. The peoples of the two countries 
have maintained close contact and have constantly exchanged 
cultural and artistic visits. Particularly in linguistic and 
cultural exchanges, the peoples of the two countries are able to 
speak to each other in their own languages and with a profound 
understanding. Far from being weak, our relations are always 
strengthening -- especially in the economic field, where a great 
deal of trade has been conducted between our two countries. The 
Lao-Thai Mekong Friendship Bridge will officially open in the 
near future, greatly facilitating mutual contacts and visits 
between the brotherly Lao and Thai peoples. I firmly believe 
that once the Friendship Bridge opens, our two peoples will 
gradually increase their trade contacts and visits with each 
other. I hope I will have the opportunity to use this bridge to 
lead another Thai parliamentary delegation to Laos. 
  The purpose of our current visit to Laos is to bring the 
Thai 
people's best wishes to our Lao brothers and further strengthen 
relations between our two countries' legislative institutions. 
  On this occasion, I would like to invite Your Excellency 
Saman Vi-gnaket to lead a Lao National Assembly delegation on an 
official visit to Thailand at your convenience as guests of the 
Thai Parliament, so that we can exchange further views and 
develop mutual understanding. In addition, I would like to 
stress that if Your Excellency and the distinguished members of 
the Lao National Assembly require any cooperation from our 
delegation or from the Thai Parliament for the sake of mutual 
benefit and close relations between our two peoples, feel free 
to inform our delegation of your request. I assure your that my 
party and I will do our best to fulfill your wishes. 
  At this time, I would like to invite Your Excellencies to 
toast the health of His Excellency Lao President Nouhak 
Phoumsavan, His Excellency Saman Vi-gnaket, and everyone at this 
banquet. May the good relations between our two countries last 
forever. [applause]

<F P=106> [Speech by National Assembly Chairman Saman Vi-gnaket at a </F>
banquet in honor of the visiting Thai parliamentary delegation 
in Vientiane on 1 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] On behalf of myself and the multiethnic Lao people, 
my wife and I are very proud to have the honor of welcoming Your 
Excellency the President [Thai Parliamentary President Marut 
Bunnak], your wife, and your party. We regard your high-level 
visit to our country as a good omen for friendly relations 
between the Lao and Thai peoples, especially between our two 
legislative institutions. We firmly believe that the successful 
talks held this afternoon in an atmosphere of friendship and 
mutual understanding will be an important factor in building and 
strengthening the time-honored, fine, traditional relations 
between Laos and Thailand. 
  Your Excellency, ladies, gentlemen, and distinguished 
quests: 
The ties between the Lao and Thai peoples are based on a spirit 
of close brotherliness and neighborliness that has existed 
traditionally since ancient times. This was noted in the speech 
by His Majesty King Phumiphon Adunyadet the Great at a banquet 
in honor of His Excellency [H.E.] Kaysone Phomvihan, president 
of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], on 6 January 
1992. The king observed: Relations between our states and 
peoples are so close that they have become inseparable; this 
bond makes us close relatives. In his speech at the same 
banquet, H.E. President Kaysone Phomvihan said: It is clear 
that if we uphold the spirit of close brotherliness and 
neighborliness, avoid developing a sense of animosity and ill 
intentions toward each other, and firmly adhere to the teachings 
of the Lord Buddha and the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence, we can be certain that any conflict between Laos 
and Thailand will be resolved. 
  In this spirit, and in our capacity as the legislative 
organizations of the two countries, I believe we will continue 
to encourage all concerned sectors to solve the problems between 
our countries. This will keep our relations smooth forever and 
further deepen the affection and solidarity between the 
fraternal Lao and Thai peoples. 
  On this auspicious occasion, I invite Your Excellency the 
President, your wife, your party, and all our distinguished 
guests to make a toast: To the happiness of His Majesty King 
Phumiphon Adunyadet the Great, her majesty the queen, and all 
the members of the Royal Family of the Kingdom of Thailand; the 
good health of His Excellency LPDR President Nouhak Phoumsavan; 
the health and happiness of Your Excellency the President, your 
wife, and your party; the health of all the ladies, gentlemen, 
and distinguished guests at this banquet; and the health and 
prosperity of the Lao and Thai peoples.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor and Japanese Trade Minister Hiroshi Kumagai met 
Wednesday [2 February] in a bid to break a stalemate in 
bilateral trade talks but the talks apparently ended 
inconclusively. The talks were aimed at reaching a new trade 
framework between the two countries with attention focused on 
improving American access to Japan's auto and auto parts 
markets, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] told a press conference. 
  The official declined to disclose the contents of the talks, 
saying both parties agreed to keep silent for now. But he 
described the atmosphere of the meeting as "friendly but 
serious." 
  After emerging from the meeting, Kantor told reporters the 
talks were "interesting." 
  After the press conference, another MITI official said the 
trade stance by both Tokyo and Washington basically remained 
unchanged throughout the meeting, hinting that the two nations 
failed to bridge a gap over the framework talks. 
  The Kumagai-Kantor meeting followed talks held earlier in 
the 
day between Kantor and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, results of 
which were also withheld in a briefing for reporters. 
  Kantor arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday in an effort to break a 
stalemate in the bilateral trade talks ahead of the February 11 
summit between Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. 
  The most contentious part of the new framework is how to 
define "objective criteria" as a way to gauge foreign 
penetration of Japan's market. Tokyo says it is against any 
setting of numerical targets as it would lead to managed trade, 
while Washington is pushing for a framework based on an accord 
reached between Clinton and then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa in July 1993, which called for the introduction of 
"sets of objective criteria, either qualitative or quantitative 
or both." 
  The official at the briefing said Kumagai and Kantor are 
unlikely to resume talks during Kantor's stay in Japan. It is 
not known when Kantor will leave Tokyo. 
  He said he is not certain whether or not subcabinet-level 
trade talks between the two countries will be held over the 
weekend as reported.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor and Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
appeared Wednesday [2 February] to have disagreed over 
Washington's demand to set numerical targets to measure the 
progress of foreign access to Japanese markets, government 
sources said. 
  Kantor, who flew to Tokyo on Tuesday in a bid to break the 
deadlock in bilateral trade framework talks, urged Hata to 
accept the demand for "objective criteria." But Hata refused, 
the sources said. 
  Officials declined to reveal what Kantor and Hata discussed. 
The two men will hold another round of talks on Thursday, the 
sources said. 
  "It's been an interesting afternoon," Kantor told reporters 
after emerging from the meeting with Hata. He did not elaborate. 
  Asked if he was still optimistic about the framework talks, 
Kantor replied, "realistic." 
  A Foreign Ministry official, who spoke to reporters on 
condition of anonymity, refused to comment on whether Kantor and 
Hata had failed to close the gap in their talks, but described 
the 90-minute meeting as "severe." 
  Kantor and Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, 
discussed 
the framework talks in general, not specific terms, the official 
said. The official said the Japanese side and the United States 
both reiterated their basic stances in the talks. 
  Foreign Ministry sources said Kantor did not openly threaten 
to impose sanctions if the framework talks failed but rather 
explained that the negotiations are being held to avoid 
bilateral trade friction. 
  On the macroeconomic front, Hata told the U.S. side that the 
government is scheduled to hammer out an economic stimulus 
package soon, the sources said. 
  Also in the talks, Kantor congratulated the Japanese 
Government on its passage of political reform bills, ministry 
officials said. 
  Hata told Kantor the Japanese Government is doing its best 
to 
prepare for the February 11 meeting between Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton, they said. 
  Japanese and U.S. officials are supposed to draw up a 
progress report on the framework negotiations before Hosokawa 
meets Clinton in Washington, the third time the two leaders will 
have met since Hosokawa assumed his post last August. But the 
two sides remain deadlocked over the definition of the 
"objective criteria," with the U.S. calling for setting 
numerical targets to measure foreign access to Japanese markets 
and Japan opposing any indicators on the grounds they could lead 
to managed trade. 
  On Tuesday, Hata told a news conference Japan will never 
accept the U.S. demand to set numerical targets, saying "such 
criteria run counter to Japanese Government efforts to promote 
deregulation." 
  The framework accord, concluded last July, calls for a 
"highly significant decrease" in Japan's current account surplus 
and promised "tangible progress" in access and sales of foreign 
goods in the Japanese market. 
  The two governments designated the Japanese automobile 
market, insurance, and government procurement in 
telecommunications and medical equipment as priority areas that 
must be settled before the February meeting. Negotiations on 
key pending issues are being held in Tokyo this week. 
  Kantor, accompanied by W. Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential 
assistant for economic policy, is scheduled to hold separate 
talks later in the day with Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of 
international trade and industry. He is also expected to meet 
Hosokawa and Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii during his stay in 
Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry said 
Wednesday [2 February] it will postpone the release of December 
balance of payments data until Monday, instead of Friday as 
scheduled. 
  The ministry said in a statement that the postponement is 
due 
to a delay in compiling related statistics because the ministry 
has to announce data on both December and calendar 1993. 
  Balance of payments data includes the closely watched 
current 
account and balance of trade statistics. 
  The postponement of the release date comes as U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor is visiting Japan on a trade 
mission aimed at breaking an impasse in bilateral market-opening 
trade talks. 
  In the framework trade talks, Washington has been demanding 
that Japan set numerical targets for imports to help assess 
progress in reducing Japan's massive surplus in bilateral trade. 
  Kantor, accompanied by Bowman Cutter, deputy director of the 
National Economic Council and chief negotiator in the talks, is 
to meet Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii and International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi 
Kumagai on Wednesday. 
  He is also slated to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
on 
Thursday. 
  The delay in release of December balance of payments data 
involves a similar postponement of the release of data on 
Japanese equity investments abroad and foreign equity 
investments in Japan until Monday, instead of Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Easing of rules on companies 
buying their own stock, a measure long sought by business and 
securities circles to reinvigorate the stock market, could be 
implemented as early as this year, according to a proposal made 
by a government advisory panel on Wednesday [2 February]. The 
government will include the step in a package of emergency 
pump-priming measures to be announced Thursday. 
  Companies have so far been virtually banned from buying back 
their own shares. The easing will allow companies to buy their 
own stock from the secondary market, thus soaking up the shares, 
which are in abundance since the late 1980s, and hopefully 
activating the stock market. 
  Conditions under which companies will be allowed to own 
their 
own stock include buying with the intention of later discarding 
the shares, or selling them off to their in-house employee 
shareholding organizations after the acquisition. 
  The Legislative Council, an advisory body to the justice 
minister, is expected to submit a report on the revision of the 
commercial law on February 16, enabling the justice minister to 
present the proposal to the current Diet session. The proposed 
amendment will allow companies to make buy-backs if they get 
approval at their regular shareholders' meetings. 
  The current law requires approval from all shareholders, a 
requirement that has proved virtually impossible to fulfill. 
  Companies will be restricted from buying back more than the 
amount set aside for payment of stock dividends. 
  When they buy with the intention of selling off the stocks 
to 
their in-house organization, the upper limit to their purchases 
will be 3 percent of the outstanding shares. 
  They will be required to sell off the shares within six 
months. An extension of the six-month period will be allowed if 
the in-house organization does not have the necessary funds to 
buy the stocks.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] on Wednesday [2 February] adopted a 15 
trillion yen economic stimulus package for presentation to the 
coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, party 
officials said. They said LDP President Yohei Kono will meet 
with Hosokawa later Wednesday to ask his government to implement 
the eight-point package. 
  The package, adopted by the party's special panel to combat 
the recession, includes a proposal for an "early implementation 
of major income tax cuts," the officials said. 
  The proposal did not mention the size of income tax cuts, 
but 
Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the party's Policy Affairs 
Research Council, told reporters it should be more than 5 
trillion yen. 
  The program also called for a substantial reduction or a 
two-year freeze of the land value tax and urged the 
reorganization of financial institutions to improve the nation's 
financial system.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei Kono 
urged Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday [2 February] 
to implement a 15 trillion yen economic stimulus package. Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference that 
Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), explained 
his party's economy-spurring program adopted Tuesday. 
  Hosokawa replied that he will try to reflect the LDP's ideas 
as far as possible in the government's stimulus package his 
cabinet is to approve Thursday, Takemura said. The additional 
economic program is expected to amount to 15 trillion to 16 
trillion yen, becoming Japan's largest pump-primer ever. 
  Earlier, Kono told reporters after emerging from talks with 
the premier, "I emphasized it would be a disaster if meaningful 
and substantial stimulus steps were not taken this time," he 
added. 
  During the 90-minute meeting, Hosokawa and Kono agreed on 
the 
need for a successful Japan-U.S. summit in Washington on 
February 11, Takemura said. Hosokawa will meet U.S. President 
Bill Clinton to assess progress in stalemated bilateral trade 
talks. 
  Although the LDP chief pressed a demand for a large-scale 
income tax cut to breathe new life into the stagnant economy, 
there was no discussion on how to offset the tax reduction, 
Takemura said. 
  The government and ruling coalition parties are making 
last-ditch efforts to reach a consensus over whether to link a 
major income tax cut to a future hike in the consumption tax. 
  Hosokawa was accompanied by Foreign Minister and Deputy 
Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and 
Takemura. 
  Kono attended the meeting along with Ryutaro Hashimoto, 
chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council. 
  Hosokawa and Kono concurred they will hold informal talks in 
the future, as the need arises, Takemura said. 
  The premier said he would like to meet again with Kono after 
returning from the United States to discuss the results of the 
meeting with Clinton, according to the chief cabinet secretary. 
Kono gave no clear response, Takemura said. 
  The LDP leader told reporters he will hold talks with the 
premier if he thinks it will be "meaningful," adding he has no 
plan to meet with Hosokawa on a regular basis. 
  Whether he will meet again with the premier, Kono said, 
depends on how much the LDP's economic stimulus program is 
reflected in the government's package.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- The leader of the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) pressed Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday [2 February] to take urgent 
measures to shore up the languishing Japanese economy. 
  "I told him the timing is important in taking 
economy-spurring measures," Yohei Kono told reporters after 
emerging from a meeting with Hosokawa at the premier's official 
residence. "I also emphasized it would be a disaster if 
meaningful and substantial stimulus steps were not taken this 
time," he added. 
  Kono quoted Hosokawa as replying he will strive to do what 
is 
necessary to boost the economy as early as possible. 
  The Hosokawa cabinet is scheduled to announce Thursday a 
massive economic stimulus package expected to total 15 trillion 
to 16 trillion yen, Japan's largest pump-primer ever, to cope 
with the economic slump. Although the premier explained that 
his government and ruling coalition parties are in the final 
stage of building consensus on a large-scale income tax cut, he 
did not touch on how the government proposes to finance the tax 
reduction, Kono said. 
  On Japan-U.S. relations, Kono said he stressed the 
importance 
of Hosokawa having a successful summit with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton next week. 
  The Japanese and U.S. leaders will meet in Washington on 
February 11 to assess progress in the bilateral framework trade 
negotiations. 
  In the meeting with Kono, Hosokawa was accompanied by 
Foreign 
Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura. 
  Kono attended the meeting along with Ryutaro Hashimoto, 
chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council. 
  Asked about possible future meetings with Hosokawa, Kono 
replied he will confer with the premier if he thinks it will be 
"meaningful," adding he has no plan to hold such talks on a 
regular basis.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- The local fiscal program, 
the basis of local government budgets, will grow 3 percent in 
real terms in fiscal 1994 from the current year to about 79 
trillion yen, government sources said Wednesday [2 February]. 
  The Home Affairs Ministry and the Finance Ministry will 
jointly announce Saturday an outline of the program for the year 
beginning next April 1. Under the program, the amount of public 
works projects sponsored by local governments will increase 12 
percent to 18.5 trillion yen for the fourth consecutive 
double-digit rise, the sources said. 
  The projects are intended to help boost economic recovery. 
  At the same time, local government bond issues will increase 
40 percent to cover revenue shortfalls in local taxes and taxes 
allocated to local governments, they said. The shortfalls are 
expected because of the prolonged national economic recession.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- The ruling coalition stepped 
up efforts Wednesday [2 February] to break a deadlock over a 
proposal to raise the rate of the 3 percent consumption tax to 
offset planned income tax cuts, coalition officials said. 
  Most coalition partners agreed to back a proposal by the 
Finance Ministry to offset the tax cuts of 6 trillion yen with a 
4 percentage point raise in the tax rate to 7 percent, the 
officials said. 
  However, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan] 
[SDPJ], 
the largest of the seven coalition members, balked at the 
proposal to balance an expected revenue shortfall from the tax 
cuts with an increase in the tax, imposed on sales of most goods 
and services in Japan, they said. 
  The coalition partners also expressed support for a Finance 
Ministry proposal to legislate a provision that would oblige the 
government to raise the consumption tax after a moratorium of 
one year, they said. 
  The SDP voiced its objections to the proposal. The SDP has 
many opponents of the consumption tax as it bolstered its 
parliamentary strength in the 1989 election on an 
anticonsumption tax platform. 
  The non-SDP coalition partners are trying to persuade the 
SDP 
to accept the revenue-balancing plan, they said. The coalition 
tussle has intensified nine days before Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa flies to the United States for talks with President 
Bill Clinton. 
  Hosokawa, whose administration is under U.S. pressure to 
revive the floundering Japanese economy by stimulating stagnant 
consumer spending, is expected to mention some pump-priming 
fiscal package featuring a tax cut at the meeting with Clinton. 
  The non-SDP coalition partners are trying to alleviate the 
SDP aversion to the tax by putting forward a proposal to change 
the name of the tax to "welfare-purpose tax" from "consumption 
tax," the officials said. 
  As the coalition's political schedule obliges it to adopt a 
comprehensive stimulative package by Thursday, Hosokawa may have 
to use his leadership to decide on the tax hike even at the risk 
of antagonizing the SDP, they said. 
  Earlier in the day, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a 
meeting of coalition leaders, "The SDP will absolutely not 
tolerate a raise in the rate of the consumption tax." However, 
other coalition partners are calling for the raise to be 
implemented by the end of 1994, saying they do not want to 
antagonize voters before a House of Councillors election 
expected in the summer of 1995. 
  Meanwhile, Hosokawa may step up cooperation with the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party in working out the details 
of the economic package aimed at balancing the income tax cut 
with the consumption tax raise, even if it alienates the 
socialists, coalition sources said. 
  Hosokawa, in a meeting earlier in the day with LDP President 
Yohei Kono, asked for an opportunity to hold consultations after 
flying back from Washington, the sources said. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said, "It is 
quite 
natural for the premier who represents the coalition and the LDP 
president who leads the main opposition party to hold 
consultations over crucial issues whenever necessary." However, 
Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist and co- leader of 
the No. 2 ruling party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), 
expressed displeasure with the Hosokawa-Kono meeting. 
  An SDP official warned the prime minister against 
approaching 
the LDP, saying the implications of the day's meeting with Kono 
were "different from ceremonial talks between the LDP and SDP 
when we were in opposition." The official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said, "I suspect that Hosokawa and 
Takemura are now in favor of severing ties with Shinseito and 
the SDP, if it helps form an alliance with the LDP." 
  After wrapping up the eleventh-hour compromise on political 
reform last Friday, Hosokawa told a news conference in an 
apparently conciliatory tone he had long sought a meeting talk 
with Kono.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Some senior officials of the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan] [SDPJ] on Wednesday [2 
February] urged that the party quit the seven-party coalition 
government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, SDP sources 
said. At a meeting of the party's policy-making Central 
Executive Committee, the officials expressed strong opposition 
to a government proposal to rename the consumption tax to 
"welfare-purpose" tax and raise the rate from the present 3 
percent to 7 percent, the sources said. 
  Among the opponents was Shun Oide, a party vice chairman, 
the 
sources said. 
  The Hosokawa cabinet, launched last August, includes six 
ministers from the SDP, the largest of the seven ruling parties. 
They are Transport Minister Shigeru Ito, Construction Minister 
Kozo Igarashi, Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato, National Land 
Agency Director General Kosuke Uehara, Economic Planning Agency 
Director General Manae Kubo and Sadao Yamahana, minister in 
charge of political reform.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- The government's Tax 
Commission stressed again Wednesday [2 February] that an income 
tax cut to stimulate the economy must be linked by law to a 
consumption tax hike. 
  Commission chief Kan Kato told reporters that "almost 90 
percent" of the advisory tax panel members reaffirmed at an 
afternoon meeting that the timing and rate of a consumption tax 
increase must be spelled out in the same tax reform law that 
cuts income tax. Kato also rejected proposals to decouple the 
two measures but issue a government statement that the 
consumption tax would be raised later to pay for the tax cut. 
  Asked about the reported plan, Kato said, "I think we would 
not be able to accept it." 
  He repeatedly stressed that the two issues must be dealt 
with 
explicitly to elicit the support of the people and said a vague 
handling of the matter would be "hiding" something from the 
people. The result would be "uncertainty and unease" among the 
public, which could damage the economy, Kato said. 
  The issue of linking the income tax cut and an increase in 
the consumption tax rate has torn at the governing coalition, 
which must settle the matter to fashion the economic stimulus 
package that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has promised to 
announce Thursday. The largest coalition member, the Social 
Democratic Party, opposes raising the 3 percent consumption tax, 
while the Finance Ministry insists that the two must be linked 
by law. 
  Kato, a Keio University professor, noted that Hosokawa has 
vowed to respect the commission's recommendations on the tax 
issue and said he trusts the prime minister will do so. He said 
it is mistaken to think that raising the consumption tax would 
hurt the economy. 
  Simulations show that consumption picks up on "last-minute 
demand" as implementation of the tax hike approaches and that 
even if it declines temporarily after the hike, consumption 
recovers within a half year, he said. Public support for the 
consumption tax has increased since it was introduced five years 
ago and the need for structural reform must be explained clearly 
to the public, Kato said. 
  The current prolonged recession is structural, not cyclical, 
and this would be a good time for structural reform, including 
revamping the tax system, he said. 
  Kato said the panel would probably meet again Friday and 
Monday but that it has largely determined the "direction" of its 
final fiscal 1994 tax reform report, which is to be issued 
Tuesday.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 2 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu has called for a shift from confrontational diplomacy 
in dealing with North Korea in preparation for an era of 
peaceful coexistence, noting the government has played a 
zero-sum game in diplomacy toward North Korea and the 
unification issue. There are many non-zero-sum games in the 
North Korean nuclear issue and in inter-Korean relations, he 
said. In a zero-sum game, a gain for one side entails a 
corresponding loss for the other side. 
  Addressing the opening session of the annual meeting of 
overseas mission chiefs on Wednesday, he said what the 
government must first consider in dealing with the North Korean 
nuclear issue is the need to prevent it from worsening 
dramatically. In the short term, the government should aim at 
guaranteeing the transparency of North Korea's nuclear program. 
  He also stressed the need for flexibility and patience in 
dealing with North Korea: "Even if North Korea earned time by 
use of delaying tactics (in its negotiations with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency on international inspections 
of its nuclear facilities), such time would not be of any help 
to North Korea's nuclear development program." 
  Commenting on President Kim Yong-sam's internationalization 
policy, Han said it is aimed at increasing the global 
competitiveness of Korean products and enriching the people's 
spiritual and material life, adding, "you overseas mission 
chiefs should bear the brunt of this policy as the nation's 
outposts." 
  Any stereotyped and predictable diplomacy should be 
transformed into a pragmatic, forward-looking and flexible 
diplomacy, he remarked. 
  Attending the opening session of the meeting, which lasts 
until the weekend, were 49 mission chiefs stationed in Asia and 
North and South America. 
  After the opening session, the mission chiefs discussed 
measures to attain peaceful unification of Korea, increased 
international cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and 
promotion of South Korea for membership in the United Nations 
Security Council. 
  The prime minister later hosted a luncheon for the mission 
chiefs at the Sejong Cultural Center, where he called on them to 
do their best in tackling security and trade issues.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
disclosed on 1 February that the possibility of completing 
inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities before the IAEA 
Board of Governors meeting slated for 21 February are becoming 
thinner and thinner. IAEA officials pointed out that even if an 
inspection team leaves for Pyongyang at the end of this week, 
there is not enough time for even submitting a preliminary 
report to the IAEA Board of Governors meeting. The IAEA 
officials said that North Korea has assumed a firm stance on a 
third round of IAEA-North Korea negotiation for nuclear 
inspections. They stressed, however, that the IAEA has not yet 
given up all hope and that the door is still open for North 
Korea.

  [Text] Efforts for the solution of the North Korean nuclear 
issue will enter a critical phase around Feb. 21 when the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will hold a Board of 
Governors meeting, the nation's top unification policy-maker 
predicted yesterday. 
  Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and national unification 
minister, said the government will step up consultations with 
the United States and the IAEA on ways to have Pyongyang accept 
inspections by the U.N.-sponsored nuclear watchdog. He made the 
remarks during a consultation on unification policies between 
government and ruling Democratic Liberal Party officials. 
  Yi also gave the meeting an analysis of the North Korean 
Foreign Ministry's statement Monday, where the communist country 
threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, 
if Washington continued to demand full-scale inspections and 
build up its forces in the South. 
  "North Koreans seem to fear that the strengthened U.S. 
military and intelligence activities in the South may be part of 
its efforts to accumulate pretexts for international sanctions 
(against them)," he said. 
  Meanwhile, a senior Foreign Ministry official said it was 
improper for North Koreans to take issue with the deployment of 
Patriot missiles in the South, which has nothing to do with the 
North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Commenting on the North Korean statement, the official said 
the antimissile missiles are for defensive purposes only and 
their deployment is part of a plan to improve the joint South 
Korea-U.S. defense capability. 
  South Korea still expects North Korea, recognizing the 
inevitability of international inspections of its nuclear sites, 
to take positive steps to receive the inspections soon, said 
Chang Chae-yong, the Ministry's director-general for American 
Affairs. He said Seoul also favors solution of the nuclear 
issue through dialogue and is closely cooperating with the 
United States and other countries concerned to achieve it.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 2 
February analyzing the statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry 
spokesman denouncing the United States for `reversing' the 
DPRK-U.S. agreement for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue 
of the Korean peninsula. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word 
article by reporter An Hui-chang, entitled "Background of the 
Statement on Reviewing the Withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT." Noting that U.S.-North Korean 
nuclear negotiations have entered "a new phase" with North 
Korea's publication of a Foreign Ministry statement warning of 
its withdrawal from the NPT, the article analyzes the North 
Korean position as aimed at "strategic purposes." First, North 
Korea wants to promptly secure "substantive fruit" by realizing 
working-level contact with the United States, instead of talks 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, through "a 
strong message" to the United States. Describing the 
substantive fruit as "attaining limited inspection" in 
negotiations with IAEA and suspension of the Team Spirit 
exercise, the article reports that North Korea must have judged 
that it had better use "strong measures" toward the United 
States in a bid to accomplish its goals rather than hoping for 
results from negotiations with the IAEA; and that by using such 
measures, the United States would eventually "make concessions," 
although initially showing "tough reactions." 
  The article cites observations of a National Unification 
Board, NUB, official that although North Korea is "outwardly" 
sternly denouncing the United States, it is maintaining the 
position not to destroy "the frame of negotiation" as long as 
the United States wants to continue dialogue. Basically, by 
releasing the recent statement, North Korea is seeking to 
"resume" negotiations with the United States to discuss the IAEA 
inspections, the Team Spirit issue, and the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks; and in this way, wants to "secure" its own 
practical interest. The paper also notes that North Korea 
intends to "consolidate" its internal unity by further creating 
"the atmosphere of tension" with the United States. 
  The liberal TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 5 a 1,300-word 
article by reporter Kim Cha-su entitled "'Attempt to Drag on 
Time' Aimed at Reducing Inspections." Noting the discussion 
between North Korea and IAEA over "the scale of inspection" is 
in the final stage, the article observes that by publishing the 
statement, North Korea is using "delaying strategy" aimed at 
dragging on time in discussions with IAEA because it is not in 
the position of accepting IAEA inspections during Kim Chong-il's 
birthday on 16 February. North Korea also thinks that if 
inspections are conducted before the IAEA Board of Governors 
meeting slated for 21 February, "heated discussions" will take 
place concerning North Korea's "nuclear development suspicion" 
by introducing the results of inspections. 
  The article observes that North Korea is attempting to 
maintain "a favorable position" regarding inspections in 
negotiations with the IAEA by expressing its "tough position" so 
"the scale of inspections" will be reduced "as much as 
possible." The article also points out the possibility that 
North Korea and the United States interpreted the promise of 
acceptance of IAEA inspections "differently." In other words, 
during a 29 December contact in New York, North Korea promised 
that it will accept IAEA inspections in such a way as to "ensure 
continuity of nuclear safeguard measures." The United States, 
however, might have interpreted this as acceptance of 
inspections "to the extent demanded by IAEA." This 
misinterpretation might have touched off North Korea's "tough 
position." 
  Concerning such various observations, relevant government 
officials predict that North Korea's "true intention" will be 
revealed during this week in its reply letter to the IAEA on the 
scope of inspections put forward by the IAEA, which North Korea 
is committed to send "within this week." The article concludes 
that the government views that although it is delaying time in 
negotiations with IAEA, North Korea will accept inspections by 
making "gradual concessions," and thus will not lead the 
situation to a "catastrophe." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word 
article by reporter Chong Pyong-chin entitled "The Government's 
View on North Korean Statement on Withdrawal from NPT." 
Regarding the recent North Korean statement as "a message" to 
the United States, the article observes that North Korea is 
attempting to "upgrade" its position during forthcoming 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks by stressing "the U.S. 
violation of promise" as the main reason for deadlocked North 
Korean-IAEA negotiations. Explaining differences in assertions 
between North Korea and IAEA on the scope of inspections, the 
article reports North Korea seems to wish to solve its problems 
at talks with the United States, instead of talks with IAEA. The 
article observes that there is "no change" in the North Korean 
policy to "settle" the negotiation over the nuclear inspections 
"in any form" before the IAEA's regular Board of Governors 
meeting slated for 21 February. The article refers to some 
observations on the ROK and U.S. side that North Korea will 
likely allow the IAEA inspection team to visit North Korea 
around 16 February -- Kim Chong-il's birthday. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 
1,200-word article by Yang Sung-hyon analyzing the background of 
the statement by a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
  Describing it as "a message to the United States," the 
article analyzes that the statement has a long-term objective to 
secure an advantageous position in future talks with the United 
States by blaming the United States for breaking a promise, thus 
causing a stalemate in the negotiations with the IAEA. 
  The article notes that "North Korea could not easily accept 
the IAEA's requirements presented in the fourth contact on 17 
January because North Korea had intended to use them as the 
conditions for a package deal in the third round talks with the 
United States." 
  The article speculates that the hard-line moves by the 
United 
States and the ROK, including discounting the meaning of the 
suspension of the Team Spirit exercise and the discussion on the 
deployment of Patriot missiles, may have stimulated North 
Korea's intention to seek a resolution through U.S.-North Korean 
contacts again. 
  The article ends by quoting a government official as saying: 
"It will be difficult for North Korea to secure another contact 
with the United States" due to the firm U.S. stance to side with 
the IAEA. 
  The independent left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on 
page 3 a 1,500-word article by Pak Chong-mun entitled "North 
Korea's Nuclear Statement in the Final Stage, Is It a Tactic or 
Does the North Mean It?" 
  Noting that the statement implies a probability that North 
Korea may depart from a peaceful resolution of the nuclear 
issue, the article reports the Foreign Ministry is gravely 
concerned about the aggravation of the situation, although it 
tries to appear calm. 
  The article analyzes that the Foreign Ministry is not 
optimistic because: "First, if the statement is interpreted as 
North Korea's actual refusal of overall inspection [chonmyon 
sachal], the situation is in a deadlock because the United 
States and the IAEA cannot make any more concessions. Second, 
if the statement is interpreted as aiming at another contact 
with the United States for further reduced scope of inspections, 
there is still little possibility of settlement because the 
United States has no reason to intervene between North Korea and 
the IAEA." 
  The article quotes a Foreign Ministry official as saying: 
"It 
seems that North Korea began negotiations with the IAEA based on 
the optimistic report by the negotiating team with the United 
States, which had apparently only reported the advantageous part 
of the agreement, but now the IAEA's requirements are facing 
strong opposition inside the North." 
  The article ends by reiterating the threat implied by the 
statement to reverse the resolution plan of the nuclear issue.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 2 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is stepping 
up "processing-on-commission" trade that is similar to the early 
shape of China's opening, the Korea Trade Promotion Corporation 
(KOTRA) said on Wednesday. 
  KOTRA issued a report titled "The Reality of North 
Korea-Japan Trade of Processing-on-commission and Inter-Korea 
Trade," which said that North Korea is encouraging 
processing-on-commission trade, following the example set by 
China in the early stages of its opening. 
  In processing on commission, foreign companies provide North 
Korean factories with raw materials and buy the finished 
products. 
  "The new trade system" which North Korean President Kim 
Il-song introduced late last year to diversify trading methods 
is very similar to "the new trade method" China began in 1979, 
the KOTRA report said. 
  Under the system, all organizations including the External 
Economy Commission, government ministries, commissions, district 
administrative bodies, trading companies and manufacturing 
enterprises should move to expand external trade in addition to 
doing their own work. 
  The system also means that the forms of trade should be 
diversified toward processing, border and compensation trade. 
  North Korea's biggest partners in processing on commission 
trade are Japanese enterprises, especially those related to 
Chochongnyon, a pro-Pyongyang organization of Korean residents 
in Japan, and the main field is the textile industry, according 
to KOTRA. 
  Textiles exported by North Korea to Japan in the form of 
processing on commission trade reached 8.7 billion Japanese yen 
in 1992, up 26.9 percent from a year earlier, and amounted to 
8.8 billion yen in the first 10 months of 1993, up 38.2 percent 
from the same period of 1992. 
  Meanwhile, South Korea is prohibiting businessmen from 
visiting North Korea, making it difficult for them to instruct 
North Korean workers on the advanced technology necessary for 
processing on commission trade for high-value-added goods. 
  South Korea's processing on commission trade with North 
Korea 
is thus limited to some simple needlework, KOTRA said. 
  Nonetheless, South Korean purchases of goods processed on 
commission in North Korea, mainly textiles, skyrocketed 729 
percent to 4.39 million dollars in nine cases last year.

  [Text] In connection with the successive civil petitions 
requesting that the U.S. bases stationed in various regions of 
the cities throughout the nation be moved to the suburbs, the 
Defense Ministry revealed on 2 February that this will be 
promoted comprehensively and step by step after taking into 
consideration the role of the U.S. forces stationed in the ROK 
complying with the change in the security environment, and in 
accordance with the developments in adjusting the scope of the 
U.S. forces stationed in the ROK. 
  In connection with the work to move some U.S. bases to 
suburbs which was already agreed upon between the regional 
autonomous bodies and U.S. bases, the Defense Ministry added 
that cooperation will be carried out to the utmost from the 
level of fulfilling the desire of the people in the region to 
move the U.S. bases. 
  Judging that an enormous amount of budget will be required 
in 
moving the communications, electronics, oil pipeline, and 
railways of the U.S. bases, the Defense Ministry viewed that if 
North Korea's nuclear issue is resolved and there is change in 
the security situation, there is a high possibility for the 
additional reduction of U.S. forces stationed in the ROK as well 
as the readjustment of stationing the bases.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- The human rights 
situation in South Korea since the inauguration of President Kim 
Yong-sam in 1993 has improved significantly except for cases 
involving communism and North Korea, the U.S. State Department 
says. In North Korea, President Kim Il-song's regime is 
repressive and subjects its citizens to rigid controls, the 
State Department said in a report issued Tuesday on the human 
rights situation around the world in 1993. The North Korean 
regime establishes security ratings for each individual which 
determine access to employment, schools, medical facilities and 
certain stores as well as admission to the Workers' (Communist) 
Party. But this loyalty system appears to have been relaxed 
somewhat in recent years, the report said. 
  In China, there has been "partial progress" but changes have 
been limited, the report said, foreshadowing continued friction 
between the United States and China over human rights. 
Washington is expected to continue to press Beijing for 
improvement in human rights conditions in return for most 
favored nation (MFN) trade privileges. 
  "The overall human rights situation improved significantly 
(in South Korea)," the report said. This was "a result of the 
fundamental shift in attitude and policy of the Kim Yong-sam 
administration. President Kim achieved two democratic, 
institutional reforms of an historic nature: The abolition of 
false-name bank accounts and the enactment of a government 
ethics law," it said. 
  "The government also decreed several amnesties that 
released, 
reduced the prison sentences of, or erased the criminal records 
of, hundreds of persons arrested for politically motivated 
acts," it said. 
  Nevertheless, the Kim administration, insisting that the 
National Security Law (NSL) is designed to thwart subversion by 
pro-North Korean forces, continued to use it to violate freedom 
of expression, association and travel, it said. 
  "The (Seoul) government invoked the NSL less, however, and 
NSL arrests declined by over half," it added. 
  On North Korea, it said the regime detains about 150,000 
political prisoners and family members in maximum security camps 
in remote areas. An October 1992 report by two former inmates 
made reference to the severe living conditions in what they 
called "concentration camps," it said. One credible report 
lists 12 such prison camps that are believed to exist in North 
Korea, it said. 
  Koreans with relatives who fled to the South during the 
Korean war appear to still be classified as part of the "hostile 
class," it said. 
  The report quoted defector Cho Kap-chae as estimating that 
the "impure" class may comprise 25 to 30 percent of the 
population. "Members of this class may still be subject to some 
discrimination, although Cho claimed that their treatment has 
improved greatly in recent years," it said. 
  Political prisoners, opponents of Kim Il-song and his son 
and 
heir apparent, Kim Chong-il, repatriated defectors and others 
have been summarily executed, it said. 
  North Korea equates "political criminals" with those who 
criticize the regime, it said. "Numerous other reports suggest 
that in the past political offenses included such forms of less 
majesty as sitting on newspapers bearing Kim Il-song's picture."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 2 (YONHAP) -- Liberalization of travel 
to China will expand the tourism deficit to a record 1.3 billion 
U.S. dollars this year, the Korea National Tourism Corp. (KNTC) 
said on Wednesday. KNTC officials are predicting that 800,000 
Koreans will visit China this year as travel to that country is 
liberalized in March, compared with last year's 200,000 Korean 
tourists to China. But the number of Chinese visiting Korea 
will be the same as last year and they will spend a similar 
amount of money here. 
  The 800,000 Korean tourists to China are expected to spend 
1.68 billion dollars, up 1.26 billion dollars from 420 million 
dollars last year. In 1993 the average Korean tourist spent 
2,100 dollars in China, in contrast to an average expenditure of 
1,700 dollars for other destinations. 
  Earlier KNTC officials predicted this year's tourism account 
would be balanced, not taking into consideration the 
liberalization of travel to China. Thus the additional spending 
on tours to China, 1.26 billion dollars, is likely to account 
for the total travel deficit this year. 
  With the hosting of "Visit Korea Year 1994," KNTC officials 
had thought tourism earnings and spending would both be about 
4.2 billion dollars this year, putting an end to three 
consecutive years of travel deficits. 
  The travel deficit reached 358 million dollars in 1991, 523 
million dollars in 1992 and 584 million dollars in 1993. 
  Under these circumstances, the Transportation Ministry and 
KNTC are busy trying to curb the tourism deficit while travel 
agencies here are pushing more package tours to China.

<F P=106> [Report by Yi Chung-il and Choe Chae-yong from Inchon] </F>
  [Text] On 1 February, Inchon Mayor Choe Ki-son issued the 
"Declaration of 2011 Inchon Internationalization" on developing 
Inchon into a international city and released the plan to 
develop Inchon into a key port of Northeast Asia in the 2000's. 
Mayor Choe pointed out: "Inchon meets various required 
conditions for being an outpost for internationalization. 
Inchon is a starting point of sea and air routes as it has an 
international trade port and Yongjongdo Airport, which is under 
construction. It also has the Kyonggi- Inchon Industrial 
Complex nearby." He said: "The positive [nungdongjok] 
internationalization is the only alternative to cut our way 
through the age of limitless competitions among countries, and 
this can firmly be established only when local cities are 
internationalized." 
  To achieve this goal, Inchon is planning to accomplish the 
following by 2011: Development of its North Port into a port 
with an annual stevedoring capacity of 25 million tonnes; 
overall rearrangement of municipal functions for the convenience 
of domestic and foreign visitors, whose number is expected to be 
100 million a year after Yongjongdo Airport is completed; and 
construction of a technopolice equipped with business, trade, 
financial, port control, information, and communication 
functions in a 5,350,000-pyong reclaimed land on Song Island. 
Inchon plans to invite a total investment of 602.4 billion won 
-- government investment of 207.5 billion won and civilian 
investment of 394.9 billion won -- to enlarge the port in two 
stages. For building the technopolice on Song Island, it also 
plans to invite a considerable amount of civilian investment out 
of the total expenses of 1.8 trillion won -- 600 billion won for 
reclamation and 1.2 trillion won for building the city. Mayor 
Choe said: "Not only businessmen in Inchon but also large 
enterprises, such as Daewoo, Hanjin, and Sunkyong express their 
intention to actively participate in the construction of the 
Inchon technopolice." 
  Mayor Choe also presented the idea of "In Tide (in the tide 
of the limitless competition)" -- a symbol of the solidarity 
among Inchon, [China's] Tianjin, and Dalian and which is named 
after the first two characters in each of the three cities' 
names -- in an effort to link Inchon's technology with Tianjin's 
labor and Dalian's resources. Inchon established sisterhood 
relations with Tianjin in December 1993 and will establish 
sistership with Dalian in March. 
  Mayor Choe will attend the opening ceremony of the standing 
Inchon goods exhibition center, the first official event since 
the presentation of the "In Tide" idea, to be held in Tianjin on 
30 March along with about 100 businessmen in Inchon, who will 
participate in the exhibition with their products. 
  Inchon has rapidly increased its trade with China since 1992 
when ROK-PRC diplomatic ties were established. The number of 
Chinese visitors to the ROK through Inchon in 1990 was 9,411, 
and that in 1993 was around 116,100, increasing over 11 times. 
The amount of export and import cargo in 1990 was 409 TEU, and 
that in 1993 was 19,195 TEU, skyrocketing over 20 times. Like 
this, Inchon is becoming a key port in the Yellow Sea age.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 2 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, former

in Beijing and Chinese officials. At that time, the aide 
received a proposal to grant an emeritus professorship to Kim 
from Nankai University, said the official, who will visit China 
to finalize Kim's itinerary. The official said he believed Kim 
Tae-chung would be able to meet with Chinese Government leaders.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 2 (YONHAP) -- The government and the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) decided Wednesday not to 
study opening the Korean market to Japanese cultural products, 
an issue raised by the recent remarks of South Korean Ambassador 
to Japan Kong No-myong. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told a joint meeting of the 
government and ruling party officials for foreign affairs that 
the remarks of Ambassador Kong are not the official position of 
the Foreign Ministry. Kong said Monday that the present ban on 
Japanese culture should be lifted soon in light of the current 
age of advanced telecommunications and mass media, which is 
rendering borders insignificant. Kong said, "it is desirable 
for Korea to open its markets now to good Japanese cultural 
products including movies." 
  Paek Nam-chi, the party's policy coordinator, quoted 
Minister 
Han as saying at the meeting, "the government is not studying 
the issue of market opening to Japanese cultural products at 
this stage." 
  Paek said, "the joint meeting agreed that studying 
importation of Japanese culture is not feasible at this stage 
because it could pave the way for a flood of foreign culture. 
And considering the special national sentiment toward Japan, it 
is not desirable either, as most participants agreed. The DLP 
is therefore opposed to any cultural market opening." 
  The party's position is to refrain from mentioning the issue 
anymore, as the Foreign Ministry has decided not to study 
opening the market, he added. 
  Meanwhile, DLP chairman Kim Chong-pil told journalists on 
Tuesday that now is not the time to begin importation of 
Japanese culture considering the national sentiment. He 
clarified his opposition to the issue, saying that the country 
should take a prudent attitude toward allowing in Japanese 
culture.

  [Text] The National League of Farmers' Association 
[Chonnong, Chairman Pae Chong-yol] integrated various farmers' 
organizations throughout the country in April 1990 under the 
common purpose of struggling for and solving agriculture-related 
problems such as opposition to imports of foreign agricultural 
products and requests for increased governmental purchase of 
their rice. 
  An open advocate of struggle for mass-oriented politics, 
Chonnong has led numerous violent demonstrations against the 
opening of domestic rice markets and for the government's 
purchase of more rice ever since its inauguration. 
  With approximately 100,000 members, Chonnong has subordinate 
organizations in 90 counties throughout the country. 
  Chonnong's predecessors are the Christian Farmers' 
Association [Kinong] and the Catholic Farmers' Association 
[Kanong] which was organized by Catholic priests in 1966 to 
protect farmers' rights and interests. 
  Also participating in last night's rally in Seoul was the 
Central Association of the Young Prosperous Farmers and 
Fisheries [Hannongyon], which is an even larger organization 
than Chonnong. However, the rally was led, for the most part, by 
the Chonnong and students belonging to the General Federation of 
Univerity Students Associations [Hanchongyon], and this caused 
the rally to be more violent. 
  A moderate organization, the Hannongyon was organized by the 
government in 1981 in an effort to prevent farmers from leaving 
their rural villages with 47,000 select farmers and government 
financial support.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 2 (YONHAP) -- Domestic consumption of 
foreign cigarettes soared last year due to a strengthening of 
sales promotion activities by foreign cigarette makers and 
importers here, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday. 
  Foreign cigarettes passing through the customs house last 
year reached 357,888,000 packs worth 283,288 million won (about 
350.6 million U.S. dollars). The volume registered a 34.2 
percent increase from the year before, while turnover rose 32.3 
percent. Foreign cigarettes accounted for 6.7 percent of the 
total volume of cigarettes sold in South Korea in 1993, up 1.5 
percent from 1992, while the proportion in turnover rose to 9.1 
percent, up 1.7 percentage points. 
  In contrast, the increase in sales of domestically made 
cigarettes both at home and abroad was a mere 2.9 percent in 
volume and 6.1 percent in turnover from 1992. 
  On the home front, the Japanese brand "Mild Seven Lights" 
(800 won or about one dollar per pack) and America's "Virginia 
Slims" (about 1.23 dollars) topped the list of foreign 
cigarettes, accounting for 27.3 percent and 23.4 percent, 
respectively, of the foreign cigarette market in volume. 
  "Marlboro Lights" (one dollar) took a 13.1 percent share of 
the market, followed by "Marlboro" (one dollar) with 5.8 
percent, "Finesse" (1.23 dollars) with 4.8 percent, "Vantage 
Lights" (1.23 dollars) with 3.3 percent and "Yves Saint Laurent" 
(1.23 dollars) with 2.0 percent.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 2 (YONHAP) -- In January, 48,955 
automobiles were exported, up 22.6 percent from 39,946 in the 
same month a year earlier, the Korea Automobile Manufacturers 
Association (KAMA) said on Wednesday. The rise was caused by 
the yen's continued strength and brisk auto sales for Hyundai 
Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. in the United States. 
  In the same month, 113,533 autos were sold at home, up 18.3 
percent, but the figure compares with 141,991 units sold in 
December last year. Among the major automakers, Hyundai Motor 
Co. ranked first both in exports and in sales at home. Hyundai 
exported 35,360 cars, up 38.1 percent, and sold 55,035 autos at 
home, up 13.7 percent. 
  Daewoo Motor Co. exported 2,027 cars, off more than 50 
percent, and sold 25,882 at home, up 42.7 percent. Kia Motors 
Corp. exported 10,013 units, up 11.0 percent, and sold 25,062 at 
home, up 6.7 percent. The figures were 521 and 2,980, 
respectively, for Ssangyong Motor Co. and 1,367 and 1,865 for 
Asia Motor Co. Hyundai Precision and Industry Co., which 
produces only the jeep Galloper for the domestic market, sold 
2,709. 
  Meanwhile, KAMA predicted that 815,000 autos will be 
exported 
this year, up 27.7 percent, and 1.56 million autos will be sold 
at home, up 10.4 percent.

  [Text] On the occasion of the Vietnamese lunar new year, a 
VNA correspondent interviewed Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet on the 
struggle to practice thrift and oppose corruption and waste, 
which he emphasized recently at the Ninth National Assembly's 
fourth session and at the government meeting in Ho Chi Minh City 
in early January. 
  Regarding efforts to practice thrift and oppose waste, the 
prime minister said this is a major issue that will have a 
direct impact on production, business, and the daily life of 
units and laborers. According to the prime minister, the task 
must be carried out from the top down to the lowest levels. 
Efforts must be made to showcase good examples from among the 
cadres and party members, while measures must be taken to 
improve the organization of agencies and motivate the people to 
abide by the law. 
  The prime minister urged sectors and agencies to strive to 
promote thrift and oppose waste in production and business at 
each organization and enterprise, and to make this a widespread 
and far-reaching movement among the people during the new stage. 
He said: Efforts must be made to save capital in order to 
achieve industrialization and modernization. This is part of 
the cause of building a prosperous people, a strong nation, and 
an advanced society. He contended that it is time for all 
localities to practice thrift. The mass media should commend 
good deeds and denounce waste and lavish spending. He said that 
the mass media plays an important role in this regard, and that 
the results of these tasks should be reviewed periodically to 
draw on experience and formulate measures to carry out work more 
effectively. Efforts should be made to renovate work styles and 
design additional concrete measures, while opposing feasts being 
organized to celebrate anniversaries or welcome high-ranking 
officials when they visit the provinces and municipalities. He 
stressed that this will save the people's time, energy, and 
money.

  [Text] The government yesterday signed a cease-fire 
agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] in 
another step toward ending the secessionist war that has killed 
more than 50,000 people over the last 20 years. 
  Ambassador Manuel Yan, the chief government negotiator in 
the 
talks with the MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari, signed the agreement 
after a government panel finished studying it. Misuari signed 
the agreement on Wednesday. Government officials said Yan did 
not immediately sign to give senior officials time to review the 
pact. The 10-page accord covers 13 provinces in Mindanao and 
Palawan. 
  Hostile actions banned under the agreement include 
kidnapping, hijacking, piracy, bombings, grenade throwing, 
aircraft bomb attacks, artillery shelling, and naval gunfire. 
The MNLF will also identify the location and unit commanders of 
its forces so responsibility for any violation of the agreement 
can easily be pinpointed.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will stress his commitment to continued political, 
economic and administrative reform in a speech to be delivered 
at Georgetown University in Washington next week, government 
sources said Wednesday [2 February]. The sources said Hosokawa 
will make a commitment to continuing the process of change now 
that his administration has successfully tackled its top 
priority task, with the passage of political reform bills 
through the Diet. 
  Hosokawa leaves for Washington on February 10 for talks with 
U.S. President Bill Clinton the following day. 
  The sources said he will also call for a strengthening of 
the 
Japan-U.S. relationship, underlining the two countries' vital 
roles in the world economy and in ensuring peace and stability 
in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Hosokawa will deliver a 15-minute speech in English just as 
he did last September at the U.N. General Assembly session, the 
sources said. As his audience will consist mainly of university 
students, Hosokawa will open the floor to questions after his 
speech. 
  He will emphasize his efforts to achieve domestic political 
reform because it is a precondition for meeting the widespread 
expectations that Japan make greater international 
contributions. The prime minister will stress his intention to 
further promote deregulation, take into account the interests of 
consumers and establish a system whereby policy decision-making 
is more transparent. 
  Hosokawa is also scheduled to make a television appearance, 
when he will have the opportunity to address the American public 
directly.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said the government 
should keep its composure because North Korea has nothing to 
gain by delaying the resolution of the nuclear issue. At the 
conference of heads of ROK overseas missions on 2 February, 
Minister Han Sung-chu said it is his view that North Korea's 
attempt to delay, whether for one or two months or for a half a 
year, will not help to promote its nuclear development 
capability and nuclear development activities. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's remarks urging composure are 
noteworthy because it is made at a time when the possibility of 
referring the North Korean nuclear issue to the United Nations 
is increasing.

<F P=106> ["United States, Nuclear Criminal on Korean Peninsula"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- The United States is 
the nuclear criminal on the Korean peninsula. 
  The nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula arose from the 
introduction of nuclear weapons into South Korea by the United 
States. 
  The United States had no sooner unilaterally scrapped 
subparagraph 13d of the Korean Armistice Agreement banning the 
introduction of combat equipment and supplies from outside Korea 
in June, 1957 than it officially declared through an 
announcement of the U.S. Army authorities that it would start 
arming the U.S. troops present in South Korea with nuclear 
weapons. Then it shipped 280 mm a-guns and Honest John nuclear 
missiles into South Korea in February 1958, and deployed them 
near Uijongbu close to the Military Demarcation Line. The U.S. 
imperialists have introduced over 1,000 pieces of nuclear 
weapons into South Korea in more than 30 years since then, 
turning South Korea into their biggest nuclear forward base in 
the Far East. 
  The density of U.S. nuclear weapon deployment in South Korea 
is one per 100 square kilometers, or quadruple that in the NATO 
nations. 
  The United States has not ceased provocative acts 
threatening 
the DPRK, wielding the large number of nuclear weapons in South 
Korea. 
  All types of nuclear-capable planes ranging from B-52 
nuclear 
strategic bomber to F-16 tactical nuclear bomber and nuclear 
weapons from intermediary-range Lance nuclear missile to back 
pack nuke of Green Beret commandoes are mobilized in the "Team 
Spirit" joint military exercise, a test nuclear war, against the 
DPRK annually staged in South Korea since 1976. Even E-4B, a 
nuclear war commanding plane is hurled into it. 
  The United States announced the "withdrawal" of nuclear 
weapons from South Korea at the end of 1991, yielding to the 
strong demand of the Korean people and the world progressive 
people for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and 
withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from South Korea. But it 
revealed for itself that its withdrawal of nuclear weapons was a 
lie by opposing a comprehensive inpsection of the U.S. nuclear 
weapons and nuclear bases in South Korea which was raised by the 
DPRK. 
  And the United States and the South Korean puppets spread 
the 
fiction of "suspected nuclear development by the North" in order 
to mislead public opinion. 
  The United States, not satisfied with the deployment of a 
large number of nuclear weapons in South Korea, is going to 
massively introduce sophisticated "Patriot" missiles into South 
Korea. And it openly declared that it would continue to stage 
other joint military exercises larger in scale, even if the 
"Team Spirit" were suspended, taking issue again with the 
fictitious "nuclear problem" of the DPRK. 
  As facts show, the outcries of the United States and the 
South Korean puppets over the non-existent "nuclear issue" of 
the North remind us of a thief crying "stop thief "

<F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Yun Pyong-son: "The </F>
United States Should Not Make a Miscalculation"] 
  [Text] The United States is creating a grave crisis which 
can lead the situation to a catastrophe [paguk] by overturning 
the promise made with us at a decisive juncture when the 
DPRK-U.S. talks can be rescued from a stalemate and when the 
prospects are opened for a package solution of the nuclear 
problem. 
  Regarding this, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry 
issued a statement strongly denouncing the brazen-faced betrayal 
of the United States and declaring our position that in the 
event the United States overturns the promise made with us, we 
no longer are bound to the promise made with the United States; 
that if the United States does not want the DPRK-U.S. talks, 
neither do we want it; and that if the United States wants to 
make any other choice, we will also choose the reciprocal 
countermeasure [sangunghan taeung pangdo]. 
  This is indeed correct. As everyone knows, in the DPRK-U.S. 
contact held at the end of last year, the two sides agreed that 
they will hold a third round of talks, that the United States 
will stop the Team Spirit joint military exercise, and that we 
will accept a limited inspection [hanjongdoen pomwiui sachal] 
necessary to ensure the continuity of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards on our nuclear sites, as a 
measure for a package solution of the nuclear problem. 
  Accordingly, we have endeavored in all our efforts to do our 
part. However, the IAEA Secretariat foolishly attempted to 
realize a full-scope inspection, [chonmyon sachal] which is not 
even an object of discussion, and the United States is urging us 
to accept it by setting a time limit with an ultimatum-like 
attitude that if we do not accept the agency's demand, the third 
round of the DPRK-U.S. talks cannot be held and it cannot but 
take the road to impose sanctions. 
  What is graver is that by once again bringing up the issue 
of 
conducting special inspections of our two military sites, which 
have nothing to do with our nuclear activity, the United States 
stands in a position of making international-pressure commotions 
against us. This is a brazen-faced betrayal and challenge of 
the party to the dialogue. 
  To proceed with dialogue and resolve the issue, one should 
faithfully keep the promise in equal position. If any one of 
the parties breaks faith with the other, putting forward its 
unreasonable demand [pudanghan yogu] to the other, there can be 
no dialogue and the problem cannot be solved. 
  The United States is, however, pursuing a dishonest motive 
by 
breaking both the promise and faith and insisting on its robbery 
demands. Isn't this a betrayal of the party to the dialogue and 
an intolerable crime blocking the road for the peaceful 
resolution of the nuclear issue? 
  The whole world recognizes that we are not developing 
nuclear 
weapons. The nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula is caused 
by the United States, which drew nuclear weapons in South Korea 
running counter to our nation's opinion, and the threat is 
aggravating because the United States has threatened us with 
nuclear weapons by ceaselessly conducting nuclear war exercises. 
  Therefore, the responsible party for resolving the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula is none other than the United 
States. It is a robbery act as if the burglar is holding the 
stick with which the United States is creating blockage for the 
peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue by picking on us about 
the non-existent nuclear issue, talking about full-scope 
inspection [chonmyon sachal] and sanctions. Contrary to its 
repeated promise of not using any armed forces, including 
nuclear weapons, and of not using them as a means of threat, the 
United States is trying to crush [apsal] our Republic by 
committing large-scale nuclear war exercises by all means. 
  This is proven by the facts that U.S. official circles are 
raving that if the Team Spirit joint military exercise cannot be 
conducted, then they plan to continue other joint military 
exercises--in Hawaii if not in South Korea; that the United 
States is full-fledgedly hurrying to deploy Patriot missiles in 
South Korea; and that an intelligence support team composed of 
specialists has been deployed to and is now in operation in 
South Korea. 
  The United States is only talking about the resolution of 
the 
nuclear issue through talks but in fact its aggressive strategy 
toward the DPRK has not changed a bit. All the facts clearly 
show that the United States has no intention at all to 
peacefully resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but 
invariably seeks only its inner intention to crush our Republic 
through strength. It is a miscalculation if the United States 
thinks its robbery pressure and military threats can threaten 
us. We love peace but would never beg for it. As declared in 
our Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, if the United States 
chooses any other way, we will also choose a reciprocal 
countermeasure. 
  If a catastrophic situation is created on the Korean 
peninsula, the United States will take all the responsibility 
for the dear price resulted thereafter. The U.S. hard-line, 
conservative forces should look straight at our people's 
unshaken will and act prudently.

  [Text] Moscow, January 31 (KCNA) -- The Russian paper 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA January 28 reported that the chief of General 
Staff of the Russian Armed Forces refuted the report of the 
Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN about Russia's assistance in the 
missile and nuclear program of North Korea. 
  The chief of General Staff, according to the paper said the 
report of the Japanese weekly was based on a rude and open false 
document and it was a clear provocation motivated by the 
intention to throw a shadow on the Ministry of Defence and the 
general staff of Russia. 
  The paper said: 
  At the same time, the chief of general staff did not rule 
out 
that this would be beneficial only to those who seek to 
complicate the relations between Russia and North Korea. 
  That is right. The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is 
now presenting itself as a very crucial matter. As was stated 
recently by a high-ranking Russian diplomat, we consider the 
sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 
which some countries insist are the worst means. Worse still, 
there are people who are trying to turn the complicated process 
of talks into an open pressure on Pyongyang. 
  It is not good to them to accuse Russia now of having helped 
the DPRK possess nuclear weapons. Is it?

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- Corporal Kim 
Chol-Chin and Private 1st Class Kim Kyong-chol of the Korean 
People's Security Forces, who had been kidnapped by the enemy 
while drifting in distress in the sea off the Tungsan Cape on 
the West Coast on January 26, came back to the socialist 
homeland through Panmunjom on February 1. 
  The South Korean puppets detained them, not sending them 
back 
to the North instantly, and tried to make them defect to South 
Korea by all sorts of appeasement and deception. They, however, 
could not break the revolutionary constancy and will of the 
a-match-for-a-hundred soldiers who have grown in the bosom of 
comrade supreme commander. 
  The South Korean puppets were compelled to send them back to 
the Northern half of the country by the stubborn protest of the 
detained soldiers and repeated demand of our side. 
  The soldiers were interviewed by reporters in our side's 
portion of Panmunjom. 
  They exposed the attempts of the South Korean puppets to 
induce them to defection. Saying that they could be embraced in 
the bosom of the socialist homeland as there was comrade supreme 
commander for them, they stated they would be loyal subjects and 
filial sons safeguarding comrade supreme commander as his rifles 
and shells.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- If the United States 
take a stance of pressure against us, our reaction will be a 
hundred times stronger and it will be carried into practical 
action, declares NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. Hailing 
the January 31 statement of a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign 
Ministry in connection with the fact that the process of a 
peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
is facing a grave challenge owing to the base perfidy of the 
United States, the analyst says: 
  The DPRK's stand stems from the unshakable will and faith of 
the Korean people who defend national dignity and sovereignty to 
the end, regarding it as their life and soul and do not yield to 
any pressure and blackmail. 
  If the United States intend to go back on its promise to us, 
we will no longer be bound by the promise we made to the United 
States. It is a gangster-like logic that one side may reverse 
the promise between the two sides and the other side must keep 
it. We cannot sit back and watch the manoeuvers of the United 
States to isolate and stifle us. 
  If the United States stick to its attitude as today, we 
cannot but reconsider our promises to the United States such as 
the unilateral suspension of the effectuation of the withdrawal 
from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, freeze of all the 
nuclear activities and renunciation of the graphite-moderated 
reactor system. 
  We have never considered that the DPRK-U.S. talks is a 
present of the United States to us. Neither have we wanted 
something from it. And we are not ignorant of its ulterior 
intention. We have only wanted that the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula would be resolved in a peaceful way as the 
Korean people and the world peaceloving people hoped for. This 
is why we have consistently insisted on negotiations with the 
United States. 
  If the United States is unwilling to settle the nuclear 
issue 
on the Korean peninsula through talks, we have no intention to 
have talks. We are not indebted to the United States for 
anything and will be able to get on without its favor. The 
United States is too ridiculous, if it considers that we will 
beg for talks. 
  It is not the United States alone that has the expedient and 
the option is not open only for a big power. We have an 
expedient to counter any other option of the United States. 
  We do not like to utter empty words. It is our invariable 
will to mean what we say. It is the unshakable determination of 
the Korean people and the People's Army to defend the 
sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation to the 
end and we are fully prepared politically and ideologically, 
militarily and materially to cope with any event of contingency. 
  The United States must not miscalculate our will and 
determination nor underestimate our might. It had better behave 
with discretion, knowing well of our people and People's Army.

  [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, Yi 
Yong-tok, the South Korean puppet minister of the National 
Unification Board, on 1 February made groundless, malicious 
gibberish on the threat to the United States, intimidation 
against the South, and so forth, pertaining to the 31 January 
statement of a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
  We cannot but say this is indeed a brigandish sophism 
completely reversing black and white and is a brazen-faced act, 
same as a thief yelling, "Stop thief!" 
  As has already been known, the United States has completely 
reversed [wanjonhi twijibo opko] its promise made to us during 
the DPRK-U.S. contact and has urged acceptance of the demand for 
full-scope inspections put forward by International Atomic 
Energy Agency Secretariat. Moreover, by designating even the 
time limit, the United States made a final notice-like threat 
and menace [choehu tongchopchogin wihyopkwa hyoppak], stating 
that if the demand is not met, the third round of DPRK-U.S. 
talks will not be held and the road to sanctions will be 
advanced. 
  The United States and the South Korean puppet clique are 
scheming to stage by all means large-scale nuclear war 
exercises, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise, 
against our Republic, and are accelerating on a full scale the 
deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea. 
  This clearly illustrates that the United States has no 
intent 
to resolve peacefully the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, 
but is pursuing its aim to crush our Republic with strength.

<F P=106> ["Who Makes Real Threat?" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppet Minister of the Unification Board Yi Yong-tok, Tuesday 
let an ugly stream of invectives branding the January 31 
statement of a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK as 
"a threat to the United States" and "an intimidation to the 
South", according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  It was a brigandish sophism reversing black and white and a 
shameless outcry reminding us of a thief crying "stop thief" 
[sentence received without punctuation mark]. 
  Completely reversing its promise to the DPRK at DPRK-USA 
contacts, the United States is urging the DPRK to accept the 
demand of the IAEA Secretariat for full-scale inspections. It 
has gone the length of setting a deadline and resorting to 
ultimatum-like threat and intimidation, declaring that it will 
not have the third round of DPRK-USA talks but seek "sanctions", 
unless its demand is accepted. 
  And the United States and the South Korean puppet clique 
plan 
to force the "Team Spirit" and other large-scale nuclear war 
exercises against the DPRK and are pushing ahead in real earnest 
with the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. 
  These facts clearly show that the United States has no 
intention at all to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula peacefully but is still pursuing the objective of 
stifling the DPRK with force at any cost. 
  It is only too natural that in the current crisis created by 
the mean and dangerous perfidy on the part of the United States, 
the spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry declared that if the 
United States defiantly went back on its promise to the DPRK, 
the DPRK would no longer be bound by the promise it had made to 
the United States and, if the United States was unwilling to 
hold another round of talks, the DPRK had no intention to have 
it, and that, if the United States wanted to seek another 
option, the DPRK would choose a countermeasure commensurate with 
it. 
  Yet the puppet clique clamoured about "threat" and 
"intimidation." This is no more than a base attempt to justify 
their sinister attempt to overpower the North by force of arms. 
  Our people will never tolerate the dangerous hostile acts 
and 
reckless new war provocation moves of the United States and the 
South Korean puppet clique. 
  The South Korean puppet clique must act with discretion, 
mindful that the blasting fuse of a new war is linked to a time 
bomb at "Chongwadae" [South Korean presidential offices].

<F P=106> ["Kim Yong-sam Puppet Regime Must Be Overthrown" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today declares that the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
regime opposed to the nation, democracy and reunification must 
be overthrown. 
  Though less than one year has passed since the self-styled 
"civilian" regime of the traitor Kim Yong-sam made its 
appearance, its treacherous nature has been fully laid bare, the 
article says, and continues: 
  The regime of Kim Yong-sam is a more anti-national, 
flunkeyist and treacherous colonial puppet regime than any of 
the preceding regimes. 
  There has been not a South Korean ruler who did not beg for 
the presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea, but there has 
never been such a ruler who has begged for the permanent 
occupation of the U.S. troops with a promise to pay more than 3 
billion dollars squeezed from the people for their maintenance. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam has opened the South Korean rice 
market, yielding to the U.S. pressure, which the preceding 
traitors had not dared to do. This is the biggest treachery. 
  His first-year record in power is really criminal and 
treacherous because he has tried not only to do harm to the 
South Korean people but to slay the fellow countrymen in the 
North, obeying foreign forces. 
  Among the successive South Korean rulers there were those 
who 
busied themselves in isolating the North but there was no such 
a traitor as Kim Yong-sam who is rushing about in the East and 
West, crying for "sanctions" against the fellow countrymen in 
the North. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam has inflicted bigger sufferings 
upon 
the people with a "civilian" fascist repressive rule more 
truculent than the military fascist dictatorship of the "Fifth 
and Sixth Republics", while advertising "civilian 
administration" and "reform politics". 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime has maintained and reinforced 
the fascist laws and repressive tools made by the preceding 
military dictatorial regimes, pursuing a vicious fascist 
dictatorial rule against the people. 
  Its anti-national and anti-democratic fascist repressive 
rule 
is the most crafty, vicious and brutal despotism of a "civilian 
fascist" outstripping the preceding military fascist regimes. 
  It is the blackest crime of the Kim Yong-sam "regime" that 
it 
has totally prohibited the dialogues, contacts and visits, 
seeking North-South confrontation rather than national unity. 
  The "civilian" treacherous group hay intentionally rendered 
the situation strained with the resumption of the "Team Spirit" 
joint military exercises suspended in the waning days of the 
"Sixth Republic's regime", the freeze all North-South dialogues 
including the North-South high level talks and foil the exchange 
of presidential envoys between the North and South. 
  The "civilian" rulers have not only frozen the dialogues 
between the authorities but also banned non-governmental 
dialogues and contacts. 
  The puppets are now inciting the North-South confrontation 
continuously while seeking a reckless war in league with outside 
forces to slay their fellow countrymen in the North. 
  Leaving intact such a most anti-national flunkeyist regime, 
a 
most anti-democratic fascist regime and a most 
anti-reunification and divisive regime as the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet regime, it is impossible to realize national 
independence, democratization of the South Korean society and 
national reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- Paek Chong-su, 
secretary general of the National Association of Bereaved 
Families for Democracy and Reunification, accused the traitor 
Kim Yong-sam of protecting former dictators. 
  In an article contributed to HANGYORE SINMUN Jan. 16, he 
branded Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u as the main culprits in 
illegally seizing "power" through the "December 12 coup". 
Noting that the traitor Kim Yong-sam "invited" those guys to 
"Chongwadae" [presidential office] allegedly for 
"reconciliation", Paek Chong-su said such act could not be 
overlooked. 
  There can be no "reconciliation" with Chon-No group, he 
stated.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique is reportedly spreading a false rumor through 
subsidized papers of South Korea that Russia is going to pay off 
the "loans" in such a manner as supplying military technology to 
South Korea. 
  The falsity of this is well proved, first of all, by the 
refutation of Russia. 
  A radio of Russia January 29 said military materials "are 
being distorted continuously" in South Korea. "There is no 
contract on paying off the loans with something like military 
technology," it quoted the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying. 
  This notwithstanding, the puppets are now spreading lies, 
fully indicating what despicable political swindlers and 
offscourings without elementary human morality they are. 
Falsity, fabrication and deception are intrinsic habits of the 
Kim Yong-sam traitorous group wearing the "civilian" veil. It 
is really foolish to forge "relations" and have dealings with 
such persons, expecting something from them. 
  Their false propaganda is aimed at inveigling Russia into 
the 
frantic anti-DPRK campaign it launched in league with outside 
forces under the pretext of the non-existent "nuclear problem" 
of the DPRK. This is not only a political mockery of Russia but 
an intolerable, undisguised challenge to the DPRK. 
  The Russian radio said "it seems that somebody wants to 
inveigle Russia into the complicated situation of the Korean 
peninsula." This is out of due concern. If Russia was embroiled 
into the situation of the Korean peninsula which has been 
brought to the brink of war by the reckless moves of the U.S. 
imperialists and their lackeys, the situation would be rendered 
all the more complicated. 
  Anybody must not do something obstructive to a fundamental 
solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and its 
peace and peaceful reunification, but do something benefitial to 
them. 
  The South Korean puppet clique is obviously scheming to 
label 
Russia as a war conspirator by inveigling it into the dangerous 
developments which may lead to a new war on the Korean peninsula. 
  It must give up reckless moves of war and confrontation 
aimed 
at slaying the fellow countrymen in the North with the backing 
of outside forces, and promptly stop fooling and doing harm to 
others.

(Hanminjon) in Damascus, published a statement denouncing the 
anti-reunification and anti-national crimes of the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, according to a report of Radio Voice of National 
Salvation from Seoul. 
  He branded the present South Korean regime as a fascist, 
treacherous regime seeking confrontation. 
  He said Kim Yong-sam has intensified the suppression of the 
people, keeping intact the fascist laws and repressive tools of 
the "Sixth Republic" through false reforms, wearing the 
"civilian" veil. 
  "Kim Yong-sam has driven South Korea deeper into the 
position 
of double domination of U.S. and Japan, totally frozen the 
North-South relations and continuously staged the nuclear war 
exercises," he noted.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- The Chairman of "the 
Democratic Liberal Party", Kim Chong-pil, at a press conference 
Tuesday said that the deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles in 
South Korea "actually presents no problem" because they are 
"defensive weapons", according a to radio report from Seoul. 
  It is only too clear that the projected deployment of 
Patriot 
missiles in South Korea practically means an extremely grave 
development that will frustrate the DPRK-USA talks for a 
solution to the nuclear issue and increase the crisis of war in 
the Korean peninsula. 
  Kim Chong-pil's treacherous balderdash clearly proves how 
persistently the puppets are trying to bring weapons of 
destruction into South Korea. 
  His outcry is no more than a shameless sophism to justify 
the 
criminal acts of the puppets in hastening the deployment of 
Patriot missiles in South Korea. 
  The South Korean puppet clique must immediately stop their 
reckless provocative moves to aggravate confrontation and 
tension between the North and the South by deploying missiles.

<F P=106> ["MINJU CHOSON on U.S. Radio `Free Asia' Project" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON in a 
commentary today brands the U.S. scheme to start the 
broadcasting of radio "Free Asia" as a shameless interference in 
the internal affairs intended to instill "the view of the value 
of American-style democracy" into the DPRK and other socialist 
countries and independent countries in Asia and thus stifle 
socialism and undermine the independent regimes in this region. 
It fully reveals the wild ambition of the U.S. to expand its 
sphere of domination in the Asia-Pacific region, says the paper. 
  The Korean people bitterly denounce the U.S. scheme to start 
the broadcasting and demand its immediate cancellation, the news 
analyst says, and goes on: 
  The United States is making a gross mistake. It seems to 
have profited by its false propaganda offensive in 
disintegrating the socialist countries in East Europe and 
bringing them back to capitalism. But such propaganda cannot 
work on Korean-style socialism in which the leader, the party 
and the masses are united in one mind. 
  The Korean people who are closely united behind the 
illustrious leader are not shaken by any war provocation 
manoeuvres, threat, blackmail and pressure nor by any yellow 
wind. 
  The United States must stop its foolish acts to corrupt and 
degenerate the Korean people and other people of Asia by base 
false propaganda and act with discretion.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 3 KYODO -- A high-level North Korean 
official has said his country is willing to join the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and develop 
contacts with capitalist countries, an East European source in 
Beijing said Thursday [3 February]. 
  Kim Chong-u, deputy chairman of North Korea's External 
Economy Commission, vowed in a conversation with a high-ranking 
East European diplomat last month to attract foreign investment 
through wider contacts with such countries, the source said. 
  According to the source, Kim said North Korea is willing to 
develop ties regardless of their political systems, "as long as 
these countries do not object to our political system." 
  "If we can limit our excessive military expenditure, which 
is 
a heavy burden to our economic development, North Korea could 
quite quickly revitalize the economy and raise the standard of 
living of its society," he was quoted as saying. 
  Kim claimed Pyongyang recently began talks with several 
major 
U.S. and Japanese auto manufacturers, pharmaceutical and oil 
firms, the source said. 
  The deputy chairman, who also supervises the Nachin-Sonpong 
Free Economic Trade Zone in the Tumen River Delta, blamed 
military spending and the collapse of the "socialist camp and 
socialist market" for North Korea's economic difficulties, the 
source said. 
  Kim, 52, considered a strong reform-minded leader, said, 
"North Korea would like to join APEC and benefit from the fact 
that it is located in Asia, the fastest growing region in the 
world." 
  Last December the nation's economic policy was declared a 
failure at a plenary session of the Workers' Party and one based 
on development of agriculture, light industry and trade, and 
strong foreign trade was implemented.

crime unprecedented in human history, and demanded that the 
Japanese prosecution punish those responsible for the 
establishment of the system of "comfort women for the army" and 
the assaulters, said the paper.

the people, he said this is no other than the great immortal 
chuche idea. 
  "The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is further developing 
and enriching the chuche idea," he said, and continued: 
  "The imperialists are most afraid of the truth that man is 
master of everything and decides everything, because they 
consider the popular masses their slaves and the target of 
exploitation. 
  "The imperialists are now most afraid of Korean-style 
socialism with the chuche idea as a guideline and the 
singlehearted unity of Korea. 
  "Genuine popular politics cannot be administered where there 
is no such a great anthropocentric idea as the chuche idea." 
Pointing out that "the chuche idea brings eternal freedom and 
happiness to the mankind, he stressed this is proved by the 
realities of Korea."

<F P=106> ["`Comrade Kim Il-song, Great Man With Warm Humanity'" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- Cuban lawyer 
Candelaria Rodriguez, who had visited Korea, said in a press 
interview in Havana on January 28 that Comrade Kim Il-song is a 
great man with humble, simple and warm humanity; 
  She was sent to Korea as a Cuban delegate of the 
fact-finding 
team of the Women's International Democratic Federation to 
investigate into the atrocities and crimes committed by the U.S. 
imperialists against the innocent Korean people during the 
period of the Korean War (June, 1950 - July, 1953). 
  She, who visited Korea in 1963 and 1993, expressed her 
impressions: 
  What astonished me greatly during my visit was that 
wonderful 
and great monumental edifices and modern streets such as 
Kwangbok Street, Tongil Street and Changgwang Street had been 
built like a forest in a matter of a few years. Pyongyang has 
been turned into a city of world level with 30-40-storeyed 
buildings. 
  The food, clothing and housing questions have been 
completely 
solved in Korea. 
  It is a beautiful trait that everybody lives evenly and 
equally in harmony, helping and leading each other forward. 
  The Korean art has combined what is traditional with what is 
modern. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song praised me as a 
comrade-in-arms of the Korean people and a revolutionary fighter 
when he received me. This cannot but be a great honor to me, an 
ordinary woman of Cuba. 
  Referring to the question of Korea's reunification, she 
said: 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward the 
"10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for 
the reunification of the country" that is acceptable to all 
Koreans in the North and the South and overseas. 
  I am not a politician but I believe that Korea will 
certainly 
be reunified in the 90s. 
  The reunification of Korea is a long-cherished desire of the 
entire Korean people. 
  Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Fidel Castro are the 
outstanding leaders of the world and socialism is sure to win 
as long as it is led by the two leaders. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il is the successor to the revolutionary 
cause of Comrade Kim Il-song.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 1 (KCNA) -- The professor of the 
Puebla State University of Mexico, Miguel Alba Vega, recently 
dedicated an article titled "Independent Policy of WPK [Workers' 
Party of Korea]" to the paper CAMBIO. 
  The independent policy of the Workers' Party of Korea for 
the 
accomplishment of the socialist cause is expressed in working 
out all lines of the revolution and construction in the interest 
of its people and in conformity with the realities of its 
country. The article said, and went on: 
  However good the experiences of other countries may be, 
President Kim Il-song never introduces them if they are not 
suitable to the realities of his country and the interest of his 
people. 
  Korea firmly maintained the line of building a 
self-supporting national economy when the revisionists forced it 
to enter an economic league, advertising about profitableness. 
  It is thanks to the wise leadership of the president that 
the 
WPK has had no a slightest deviation in its nearly 50-year-long 
guidance to the revolution and construction. 
  The independent policy of the WPK is also expressed in 
solving all problems arising in the revolution and construction 
on the principle of self-reliance. 
  The president, believing in the people and depending on 
them, 
led the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and the fatherland 
liberation war against the U.S. imperialists to victory as well 
as the construction of a new country after the liberation, the 
post-war rehabilitation and construction and the socialist 
revolution to victory. 
  The WPK's independent policy is surely guaranteed by the 
principle of chuche in ideology, independence in politics, 
self-sustenance in economy and self-reliance in defence. 
  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has now turned 
into 
a socialist country steadily developing on its own foot, not 
being subordinate or dependent. 
  This is the result of the independent policy with which the 
Korean people value independence and dignity more than their 
lives and allow nobody to trample down national independence.

<F P=106> ["Invincible Is Cause of Korean-Style Socialism Led by Great </F>
Strategist"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 1 (KCNA) -- The cause of 
socialism continues advancing triumphantly in Korea, unshaken by 
any challenge and manoeuvres of the imperialists. The key to 
this advance is the guidance of this cause by the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great strategist of revolution. 
  NODONG SINMUN says this in a by-lined article today. 
  The article says Comrade Kim Chong-il is leading the 
revolution and construction of our age to victory with rare 
wisdom and ever-victorious, chuche-based strategy and tactics. 
  Noting that the Korean people are able to successfully 
accomplish the revolutionary cause of chuche as they have the 
dear leader at the head of the party and the revolution in the 
historical period in which the cause of socialism is being 
carried to completion, the article says this is a great fortune 
and happiness for the Korean people. 
  The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as 
saying: 
  "Comrade Kim Chong-il is a true leader of the people, 
possessed of literary and military accomplishments and loyalty 
and filial piety. He is an outstanding thinker and 
theoretician, politician and military strategist and the pattern 
of those infinitely loyal and devoted to the country and the 
people." 
  The article says: 
  The history of the dear leader's leadership of the 
revolution 
and construction is recorded with brilliant leadership of a 
great strategist of the revolution who has led the socialist 
cause of our age along a straight path to victory with 
ever-victorious strategy and tactics. 
  His traits as a great strategist of the revolution find 
graphic manifestation in that he, with a scientific insight into 
the requirements of the time and revolution, clearly indicates 
all the strategic and tactical questions arising in 
accomplishing the cause of socialism. 
  His greatness as a strategist of the revolution is well 
illustrated by the fact that, after the collapse of socialism in 
some countries, he has given a clear exposition of strategic and 
tactical questions for rebuilding the socialist movement on a 
new foundation and leading it to a constant upswing. 
  The traits of the dear leader as a great strategist of the 
revolution find expression also in that he has led socialist 
construction to a success, overcoming difficulties with tactical 
resources, and has effected a steady upsurge in revolution and 
construction with bold and ambitious operations. 
  He employs mysterious tactics of turning adversity into 
favorable circumstances and turning a misfortune into a blessing 
in face of any formidable enemy and vast tasks of the 
revolution. It is the source of invincible strength that makes 
it possible to actively overcome the difficulties in the 
revolution and constantly make an impressive advance in the 
revolution and construction. 
  All the operations shaped by him are far-sighted ones 
foreseeing the distant future of the revolution. They are 
characterized by unexcelled grit, skilful organizational ability 
and revolutionary sweep which guarantee greatest successes in 
the shortest period through the mobilization of all forces. 
  The article further says: 
  The great strategy and tactics of the dear leader who plans 
all the work in a bold and ambitious way are most revolutionary 
ones based on unquestioned trust in the popular masses. 
  It is because he is possessed of matchless intelligence and 
scientific insight that he has been able to map out great 
strategy and tactics one after another to bring the socialist 
cause of our age to accomplishment. 
  The unexcelled grit and will unshaken under any stress and 
storm are the secret of his advancing great strategy and tactics 
for leading the revolution always to victory under any 
circumstances. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il is, indeed, an outstanding leader of 
the 
socialist cause of our age, who is possessed of the qualities 
and traits as a great strategist of the revolution on the 
highest level.

  [Text] The soldiers of the People's Army are firmly 
defending the defense line of the socialist fatherland. They 
are actively helping the workers who have vigorously launched 
into the work to fulfill the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy by highly upholding the militant task put forth by the 
great leader in his New Year address and the decisions made at 
the 21st plenary session of the sixth party Central Committee. 
  During the past one month, the one-a-match-for-100 frontline 
soldiers vigorously carried out assistance work to mines, 
railway stations, and cooperative farms over several occasions. 
  At the Korean People's Army [KPA] unit to which Comrade Kwon 
Chae-il belongs, it is strengthening assistance work to mines by 
upholding the party's intention to firmly give priority to the 
mining industry, the leading sector of the people's economy. 
Recently, the soldiers of the unit went to various mines and 
carried out the battle to transport wooden prop. Also, the 
commanders of the unit prepared many gifts and donations and 
visited the mines with the families of the art agitation group. 
They held recreational activities and vigorously carried out 
the political work. The workers of the mines who were 
encouraged, overfulfilled their excavation plan by an increase 
of 20 percent. 
  During their vacation, the commanders and soldiers of the 
unit to which Comrade Yi Tong-sok belongs went to 33 railway 
stations to help railway repair work which is to strengthen the 
hardness of the rails. They also cleared away snow, a section 
which was 70-ri long. They also handed over various gifts and 
donations which they prepared sincerely. 
  The commanders and soldiers of the unit to which Comrade 
Choe 
Pyong-sun belongs went to railway stations on many occasions 
from late last year to this year, and helped workers repair 
railways, carry out work to help the traffic in the railway 
stations, and helped transport large quantities of material. 
They also sent gifts and donations to about 10 railway stations. 
  At the party committee of the unit to which Comrade Pak 
Yong-sik belongs, it discussed ways to actively help cooperative 
farms in its region prepare for the new farming season, and led 
the soldiers to practically help farm work from the position of 
master. Therefore, during the past two days, the commanders and 
soldiers of the unit went to 13 cooperative farms and 
transported about 800 tonnes of manure to the fields and helped 
various farming work including the work to improve the cold and 
damp fields. 
  The farmers at these cooperative farms said that our Army 
which is upholding the dear comrade leader as the supreme 
commander is truly different. They also said, overflowing with 
happiness, that they are able to carry out farming work this 
year all the better because the soldiers are sincerely helping 
with the farming work as if it was their own work. 
  The soldiers of the unit to which Comrade Chong Tal-pom 
belongs said that they should contribute to fulfill the high 
goal of grain output presented by the party at this significant 
year which marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of the 
agricultural thesis. They prepared in a short time 700,000 cloth 
bags, some 6,000 wooden wind protective hedges, and many soil 
levelers to protect against the wind. All these were loaded in 
150 trucks and were handed over to the cooperative farms. They 
also transported 1,700 tonnes of manure and produced some 120 
tonnes of humus soil during two days. Thus, they practically 
helped the farmers prepare for the new farming season. 
  Soldiers of various units including the unit to which 
Comrade 
Pak Kun-ho belongs assisted farms last year on 10 occasions. 
Recently using their vacation, they once again helped these 
farms. 
  Also, soldiers of various units including units to which 
Comrade Chong Kyu-hwan, Comrade Kim Pong-nam, Comrade Yi 
Tong-sok, Comrade Choe Pyong-sun belong sent agricultural 
materials to cooperative farms and helped farmers accelerating 
the work to prepare for the new farming season. They also 
helped the livelihood of families of fallen soldiers, bereaved 
families of a person killed by the enemy, and disabled veterans. 
  Twenty-six soldiers including Chong Song-chol, Kim Song-kuk, 
the officers of the unit to which Comrade Choe Yong-yon belongs, 
visited the Mangyongdae cooperation farm during their vacation 
and worked with the farmers, thus further deepening the 
Army-people affection.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Our Party's Immortal Ideological and </F>
Theoretical Achievements That Have Deepened and Developed the 
Great Chuche Idea"] 
  [Text] The immortal chuche idea created by the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song is constantly being deepened and 
developed by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideological 
and theoretical activities without sleep or rest. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: Comrade Kim 
Chong-il is glorifying our party's chuche idea as a great 
guidance idea of the independent age [chaju sidaeui widaehan 
chido sasang] by carrying out ideological and theoretical 
activities with extraordinary ability and energy. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the great successor 
and 
leader [yongdoja] of the chuche revolutionary cause, has 
completely systemized the respected and beloved leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song's revolutionary idea based on the chuche ideological 
and theoretical method and generally elucidated anew its 
historical position, nature, and content, thus deepening and 
developing it into a unique revolutionary guidance idea of our 
times, the independent age. 
  The importance of the ideological and theoretical 
achievements by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has 
deepened and developed the great chuche idea, is that he 
generally systemized the chuche idea and completed aspects 
worthy of the revolutionary guidance idea of the independent age 
and fulfilled its lofty duty. The dear comrade leader first 
explained the philosophical view of the world scientifically in 
a human-oriented way, so that he made the chuche idea a complete 
revolutionary doctrine that elucidates the way to pioneer man's 
destiny. 
  An essential characteristic of the chuche idea lies in the 
fact that it is based on the new, human-oriented philosophical 
view of the world. From the chuche viewpoint that the primary 
aim of the view of the world is to elucidate the way to pioneer 
man's destiny, the dear comrade leader stipulated that the 
explanation of man's position in the world and man's role in the 
world changes and development is the primary question the 
philosophical view of the world should solve. 
  He also scientifically explained that independence, 
creativity, and consciousness belong to man's basic character. 
Based on this, he elucidated the new, human-oriented 
philosophical principle that man reacts to the environment 
independently, creatively, and consciously on purpose; occupies 
the master's position in the material world; and plays a 
decisive role in developing the material world. 
  As the dear comrade leader completely explained the 
human-oriented philosophical principle, the chuche [words 
indistinct], it has been clearly revealed that man's position 
and role has become higher and greater in the world because of 
man's independent and creative activities and that the world 
becomes more man-centered and comes to serve man all the more. 
The dear comrade leader also embodied the chuche philosophical 
principle in the area of social history, so that he elucidated 
anew the popular mass-centered principle of social history and 
prepared theoretical grounds that have great significance in 
developing overall social sciences. 
  While appreciating positive aspects and significance of the 
past materialistic opinion on history, the dear comrade leader 
explained its limit in history and gave a scientific explanation 
on the general principle of social development. 
  The dear comrade leader declared it as a basic principle of 
social development that man's position and role in nature and 
society has become higher and greater according to the 
development of man's independent ideas, consciousness, and 
creative ability. As the dear comrade leader discovered the 
basic principle of social development, it has become clear that 
advanced capitalist countries cannot reform the old social 
system in a revolutionary way -- although they have high 
production capability -- because they are behind in remolding 
man, who is in charge of reforming society. 
  It has also become clear that socialism has been frustrated 
in some countries mainly because they did not promote remolding 
man in a revolutionary way in conformity with the new socialist 
system so that people could not fulfill their responsibility and 
role as masters of socialist society. 
  Our party's strategic policy on occupying both material and 
ideological fortresses of socialism, communism, and on giving 
priority to occupying the ideological fortress has invincible 
vitality, and so does the general line of socialist construction 
on vigorously carrying out the three revolutions -- ideological, 
technological, and cultural -- while enhancing the function and 
role of the people's power. This is because they are embodying 
the chuche principle of social development. 
  For the first time in history, the dear comrade leader has 
elucidated that mankind, a social being, has a sociopolitical 
life -- different from the quality of physical life -- and that 
individuals will only obtain the valuable sociopolitical life if 
they are members of the collective, the main body of 
sociopolitical life. This occupies an important position in his 
achievements that have deepened and developed the chuche idea. 
  In this way, the dear comrade leader -- who has expounded an 
original ideology and theory on the sociopolitical life and 
opened a new epoch for establishing the chuche-oriented view of 
life -- has elucidated the truth that for the social collective 
to become a sociopolitical organism, it must be organically 
merged with a center, a central organization. He has also newly 
and scientifically explained the basic doctrine that will merge 
this organism into the position and role that the leader 
[suryong], the party, and the masses would occupy within the 
sociopolitical organism. 
  As a result, he has put the chuche-oriented revolutionary 
view of the leader [suryong], the view of organization, the view 
of the mass, and the view of morality on a profound ideological 
and theoretical foundation. He has made an historic 
contribution to creating the chuche-oriented view of life, which 
pursues a rewarding and happy life in glorifying the 
sociopolitical life by participating in the revolutionary 
struggles befitting the master under the leadership of the party 
and the leader [suryong]. 
  What is important in the immortal ideological and 
theoretical 
achievements gained by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who 
has deepened and developed the great chuche idea, is that he has 
newly developed and enriched the chuche revolutionary theory and 
the leadership method based on the philosophical doctrine of the 
chuche idea in conformity with the demands of the current times. 
  Based on his scientific explanation of the basic 
characteristics of modern imperialism, the dear comrade leader 
has newly established theories, strategies, and tactics capable 
of victoriously leading the socialist and communist cause. 
Also, he has elucidated that imperialists, who fought each 
other in the past, have entered a new stage of further 
strengthening exploitation and suppression of the world's 
people, thus conspiring with each other today. 
  In this way, the dear comrade leader has fully analyzed the 
reactionary or antipeople characteristics of modern imperialism 
-- which is different from that of the past. Based on this, he 
has expounded a new strategy to win victory in the independent 
cause, the socialist, and the communist cause. 
  By internationally conspiring with each other, the 
imperialist powers have strengthened exploitation and 
suppression of the people. As a result, the world has been 
further divided into two poles in which the rich get ever richer 
and the poor get ever poorer. Also, the social and class 
foundation capable of burying capitalism has been further 
expanded and strengthened. 
  We can successfully effect an upturn of converting 
capitalism into socialism only if we strengthen revolutionary 
and independent chuche under such circumstances, thus alerting 
the masses of their independent and ideological consciousness 
and politically uniting them with each other. 
  In explaining the current changed class structures in a 
capitalist society, the dear comrade leader has developed a 
ideological and theoretical guideline for making the working 
popular masses conscious of and organized into the socialist 
ideology -- the revolutionary ideology of the working class -- 
by overcoming all descriptions of right and left deviations. As 
a result, he has elucidated a way to develop the revolutionary 
struggle for socialism onto a new higher stage. 
  The dear comrade leader originally expounded a new 
party-building theory that the working class party should be 
strengthened and its leadership role should be raised in order 
to revolutionize and win over the broad working popular masses 
in conformity with the class composition of a society that 
changes as it develops. He has fully expounded principles and 
plans to strengthen the party, while defining the enhancement of 
the party's leadership role as a lifeline for guaranteeing the 
victory of the revolution and construction. 
  Based on the chuche idea centered upon mankind, the dear 
comrade leader has put forward, for the first time in history of 
the building of the working class party, a new principle that 
the work with man is a basis of the party's work and has 
presented a combination of the party's monolithic leadership and 
line as the basic principles of party activity. As a result, he 
has elucidated a way to follow correctly the party's leadership 
for the popular masses. 
  As shown by historical experiences, we can win victory in 
the 
revolution and construction only when we firmly fortify the 
driving force of the revolution and raise its role. To firmly 
strengthen the driving force of the revolution and raise its 
role, we must, above all, strengthen the party and its 
leadership role. This is the solid truth. 
  Truly, the dear comrade leader has deepened and developed 
the 
chuche idea and gained a great achievement, which will shine 
forever in history, in enriching its treasure house by 
energetically conducting ideological and theoretical activity 
without sleep or rest. 
  The chuche idea, which the great leader [suryong] has sown 
its seed in the soil of our nation and fostered for a long time, 
has been greatly advanced and enriched by the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Thanks to the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideological 
and theoretical activity, the chuche idea has been developed 
into the authorized guide of the independent era of our time and 
has vigorously led the hundreds of millions of the people 
throughout the world to the single road of independence by 
griping their hearts.

<F P=106> ["Rural Theses Is Great Revolutionary Banner Leading </F>
Socialist Rural Construction to Victory"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an article headlined "Rural Theses Is Great 
Revolutionary Banner Leading Socialist Rural Construction to 
Victory" contributed by academician, Prof. and Dr. Chon Yong-sik. 
  The article quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as 
saying: 
  "As the theses on the socialist rural question gives a 
comprehensive exposition of how to bring the advantages of the 
socialist rural economic system into full play, we can bring 
them into full play when we go along the road indicated by the 
theses." 
  It goes on: 
  The past 30 years of carrying through the theses on the 
socialist rural question published by the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song in February 1964 has powerfully proved that the 
theses is, indeed, a great program to successfully accomplish 
the socialist rural construction as well as the cause of 
socialism as a whole. 
  The rural theses is a program of the socialist rural 
construction to defend socialism and bring its advantages into 
full play by actively encouraging and developing collectivism in 
the rural economy. 
  Collectivism is the life and soul of socialism. 
  The rural theses of the great leader is a program of the 
socialist rural construction to strengthen and develop socialist 
collectivism. It indicates the way of arming the farmers with 
the collectivist idea and high scientific and cultural 
knowledge, industrializing and modernizing agriculture, 
overcoming immaturity of cooperative economy in all aspects of 
ownership and management and raising it up to the level of the 
state-run economy, the highest stage of development of the 
socialist economy. 
  It is also a revolutionary program of socialist rural 
construction to make a victorious advance not only of the rural 
economy but also of the socialist cause by strengthening the 
internal force of socialism. 
  The validity and greatness of the rural theses lie in 
strengthening the guidance of the party and the state over the 
countryside in every way, patterning the farmers on the 
working-class and firmly preparing them to be resolute 
supporters and defenders of socialism, reliable and competent 
builders of the socialist rural community. 
  The principle and tasks of the rural theses including the 
idea of pushing ahead with the three revolutions, ideological, 
technical and cultural, and strengthening the guidance of the 
party and the state over the countryside make it possible to 
build up our countryside as an invincible fortress of socialism 
by creditably carrying on the socialist rural construction and, 
at the same time, strengthening the motive force of revolution 
in the countryside. 
  The socialist rural theses is also a great program of the 
socialist rural construction to help the entire agricultural 
working people lead a worthy and happy life as full-fledged 
masters of the countryside. 
  It leads the farmers to extricate themselves from the old 
shackles of all ideological, technical and cultural fields, hold 
the position of the full-fledged masters of the countryside and 
glorify the dignity and honor of the masters. 
  There can neither be hotbed of exploitation nor be a gap 
between the rich and the poor in our countryside advancing along 
the road of the rural theses.

  [Excerpts] Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the State 
Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] and commander in chief 
of the defense services, attended and delivered a closing 
address at the third day session of the 1993 third coordination 
meeting, which is held every four months, between the SLORC and 
state and division law and order restoration councils [LORC]. 
[passage omitted] 
  Sr. Gen. Than Shwe, in his closing speech, noted regional 
authorities have presented reports on the progress of 
implementing development activities, future projects, and that 
responsible personnel from the central level have given 
necessary explanations. [passage omitted] He also noted examples 
from the experience of near disintegration of our country and 
other tragic incidents in other countries around the world. He 
also stressed that present activities should leave behind good 
legacies for the new government, which will emerge in accordance 
with a firm constitution rather than becoming a burden for the 
future. Thus, all regional activities should be regarded as 
beneficial for the country's development. 
  Next, the SLORC chairman explained that country's present 
situation has reached a junction and we must send the country on 
the path to become a modern, developed, and tranquil country. 
He said the National Convention is being held in order to draw 
a new and firm constitution in order to achieve that goal, while 
efforts are being made for national reconciliation and national 
unity. Sr. Gen. Than Shwe reiterated the invitation extended to 
armed organizations in the jungles, which came into being 
together with the country's independence, to return to the legal 
fold and join earnestly in implementing development works of the 
country. He stressed the genuine goodwill in the invitation 
because full efforts can only be put into the country's 
development when there is national unity. He also noted the 
connection between politics and economics and urged responsible 
personnel to try to develop both politically and economically. 
Continuing, Than Shwe explained the responsibility for economic 
development lies not only with the various ministries, but also 
with regional authorities. Regional authorities should take the 
responsibility of developing their own region and Than Shwe 
stressed the need to share responsibilities. The SLORC chairman 
explained that the delegation of authority to regional personnel 
is for better management. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report from correspondent Larry Jagan in Rangoon] </F>
  [Excerpt] The National Convention, which is drawing up 
guidelines for drafting Burma's constitution, is continuing with 
its closed-door sessions. Work committees concerned are 
preparing to submit reports on the three chapters -- the state, 
the state structure, and the head of state. 
  Even before the National Convention was convened, the SLORC 
had told the delegates they were to guarantee a leading role for 
the military in Burmese politics. However, the military may not 
get all their demands, says Larry Jagan, who is currently in 
Rangoon. 
  There are reports that, as the closed-door meetings of the 
work committees continue, more differences over the state 
structure are emerging. Deliberations are being made as to 
which zones, areas, and divisions should be granted the right of 
self-administration. There has been no decision on the states 
with the right of self-administration and the Wa are reported to 
be distraught over the matter as they had demanded a separate 
independent state. They had said that they would not give up 
arms if they were not given statehood. It is not clear whether 
they will be satisfied with an offer of the status of a 
self-administered area. 
  The issue of self-administered areas would involve a 
division 
of the Shan State, and the SNLD, the Shan Nationalities League 
for Democracy, had strongly protested over the matter. 
Well-informed sources say that they are expected to raise the 
problem when they present a report early this month. The 
problem is expected to become more complicated when the delegate 
representing Kachin [Kachin Independence Army] 4th Battalion at 
the National Convention discusses the matter of granting it a 
self-administered zone within the Shan State. According to 
well-informed sources, the Kachin delegate is expected to demand 
a separate and independent self-administered zone within the 
Shan State. The SNLD is not expected to accept such a demand. 
As the Kachins have been given a state with the right of 
self-administration, the organizers of the National Convention 
are duty-bound to reject the demand. 
  The Burmese military authorities want to avoid direct 
criticism against them at the National Convention and they 
certainly do not like publicity for the main opposition party, 
the National League for Democracy [NLD]. Both the SNLD and the 
NLD severely criticized the military administration in their 
submissions last year. The reports prepared by them have to be 
submitted to the authorities before their submission to the 
convention. Each delegate group has to submit its suggestions 
for approval before submission to the convention. 
  According to reports in Rangoon, there was a reference 
during 
the discussion in the conference hall to the NLD in describing 
the democratic forces as a spent force of the past; however, the 
NLD was able to rebut it, saying they are not a spent force of 
the past. The military authorities were reported to be 
embarrassed by the incident. It is clear that the military 
authorities are (?taking measures) to prevent such incidents.

<F P=106> [By Kalimullah Hassan] </F>
  [Text] Beaufort (Sabah) -- Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed yesterday kicked off his federal ruling 
National Front [NF] coalition's election campaign here with a 
biting attack against his political enemy, Sabah Chief Minister 
Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan. 
  Dr. Mahathir promised unbridled development and progress for 
the state if Sabahans reject Datuk Kitingan and his rebel Parti 
Bersatu Sabah [PBS] in the February 18 and 19 state polls. But 
he cautioned that the oil and timber-rich state would experience 
continued economic stagnation if it rejected the NF again. "If 
you make a wrong choice again, you will have no one to blame but 
yourselves," he told a crowd of several thousands in this small 
rural town, 160 km from the state capital, Kota Kinabalu. 
  Dr. Mahathir, who is campaigning against the PBS for the 
first time in a state election since 1985, made no bones about 
what he thought of Datuk Kitingan, a stocky bespectacled native 
Kadazan lawyer who is seeking a fourth term in office against 
the might of the NF. Datuk Kitingan and the PBS earned the NF's 
wrath when they deserted the federal ruling coalition on the eve 
of general election in 1990 to back an opposition alliance led 
by former Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. 
  State-federal ties, never comfortable since the PBS came to 
power in 1985, had deteriorated since then with Dr. Mahathir 
laying the blame squarely on Datuk Kitingan. 
  Yesterday, Dr. Mahathir said Datuk Kitingan's conviction on 
corruption charges on January 17 proved his point that "Pairin 
just wants to serve his own and his family's interests; not that 
of the people of Sabah". He said that it was "a shameful thing" 
for Sabah and Malaysia to have the state led by a chief minister 
who had been convicted of graft. 
  Dr. Mahathir's address followed that of normally 
mild-mannered Sabah NF chief Tan Sri Sakaran Dandai who vowed to 
"crush the PBS for taking Sabah into economic decline". 
  The attacks on the Sabah chief minister were a calculated 
risk by the NF to demolish the "Pairin magic" widely attributed 
for the PBS continued success in three state polls. Datuk 
Kitingan is revered by the mainly-Christian Kadazans who form 
the majority, in about 40 per cent of the 48 elecoral 
constituencies in the state and enjoys a wide following amongst 
the other races. 
  By focusing on his conviction, the NF intends to shatter the 
Pairin myth and draw support to itself. But some analysts said 
such attacks ran the risk of drawing greater sympathy for Datuk 
Kitingan who was perceived by many of his supporters as a 
political victim when graft charges were levelled against him. 
  Datuk Kitingan was fined [Malaysian dollar] $1,800, a 
sentence light enough to allow him to remain as chief minister 
and lead the PBS. 
  Dr. Mahathir also touched on the unsound state-federal ties, 
saying that Kuala Lumpur had no reason to be unkind to Sabahans. 
  Last week, Datuk Kitingan admitted that investments in Sabah 
had declined but blamed it on Kuala Lumpur's failure to maintain 
roads and provide adequate electric supply. 
  Dr. Mahathir's attacks on Datuk Kitingan and the PBS, 
telecast live over state-owned Radio Television Malaysia, signal 
that the coming campaign will see state-federal relations 
further battered. 
  Datuk Kitingan himself has taken a tougher stance in the 
last 
week attacking the federal government for not providing enough 
assistance to the state. Dr. Mahathir leaves for Kuala Lumpur 
later today.

  [Text] Kota Kinabalu -- Sabah's seasoned political 
workhorse, Tun Datuk Mustapha Harun, will return here within the 
week in bid to wreak political revenge on his former colleagues 
from the federal ruling National Front (NF). Tun Mustapha, 75, 
smarting from the rejection of his leadership by his former 
associates in the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), 
quit as federal cabinet minister and UMNO member two weeks ago. 
Although he then announced his intention to retire from 
politics, his supporters here say that Bapak Tun (Father Tun), 
as he is popularly known will make it clear on his return that 
he wants Sabahans to reject the NF in state polls on February 18 
and 19. 
  His followers are planning a hero's welcome for him to rival 
the large crowds which met Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed on his visit here on Monday. They plan to put up 
pictures of Tun Mustapha and Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Joseph 
Pairin Kitingar from the airport to Tun Mustapha's nearby 
Tanjung Aru house. 
  The intention is to send a message to Sabahans that Tun 
Mustapha, still revered by sections of the state's Muslim 
population, gives his blessings to Datuk Kitlngan's Parti 
Bersatu Sabah [PBS or Sabah United Party], which is seeking a 
fourth term in office against the might of Dr. Mahathir's NF. 
  Many Sabahans believe Tun Mustapha still retains 
considerable 
influence and could make the difference in marginal 
constituencies where UMNO is challenging the PBS. His alliance 
with Datuk Kitingan, his followers believe, will dispel the 
long-held suspicions of his supporters against the PBS which is 
fielding three of Tun Mustapha's sons in the elections. 
  Tun Mustapha and Datuk Kitingan were once bitter enemies but 
according to one senior civil servant here, who is familiar with 
Sabah politics, people would not be surprised if the two teamed 
up. "In Sabah, more so than anywhere else, there are no 
permanent enemies and no permanent friends in politics," he 
said. Even Dr. Mahathir alluded to this in his parting news 
conference yesterday when he was asked to comment on whether he 
trusted one of the NF's staunchesl critics, former Deputy Chief 
Minister Datuk Yong Teck Lee. Datuk Yong quit the PBS two weeks 
ago to form a new party, the Sabah Progressive Party, which Dr. 
Mahathir accepted into the coalition yesterday. 
  Dr. Mahathir replied: "In politics, sometimes we fight, 
sometimes we make friends. Today, we have one opinion, 
tomorrow, we change to another."

  [Excerpts] 1994 should indeed be the year of elections with 
the Sabah government's decision to dissolve the State 
Legislative Assembly 18 months earlier than scheduled. The move 
to dissolve the assembly by Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Pairin 
Kitingan did not surprise anybody because it had been the talk 
of the town for some time. It is still interesting, however, to 
discuss the timing behind Pairin's move to dissolve the assembly 
and gain a new mandate from the people. [passage omitted] 
  Politically speaking, Pairin might have believed that the 
earlier-than-scheduled elections would serve as the most 
effective weapon against the 17 January court ruling. But 
looking at the current situation, the wellbeing of the Sabah 
people seems to be a more urgent matter which requires more 
attention than Pairin's fate on that day. Having experienced 
lengthy political upheavals in the past few years, the Sabah 
people now have the opportunity to think again and ask 
themselves what they really want from the coming state elections. 
  The Sabah people should also ask themselves what they want 
to 
achieve, namely development and life's prosperity or a struggle 
still shrouded by irrelevant elements after 30 years of 
independence. They should be aware of the fact that blind 
faith and loyalty will bring about dire consequences to their 
grandchildren's wellbeing. 
  The Sabah people naturally do not want to live an uncertain 
life, devoid of political stability and in constant hostility 
with the central government. They certainly do not want to lag 
behind other states which are making rapid progress in 
development programs. We have no idea of Pairin's plan for 
himself -- whether he wants to retire from politics and transfer 
the party leadership to another person or whether he wants to 
take part in the coming elections and continue his political 
life. 
  In the current situation, the Sabah United Party apparently 
wants to test the waters and gauge its own strength, described 
by many observers as declining, before making noises as to 
whether it wants to rejoin the National Front, which it 
abandoned in 1990 in a truly unfavorable situation. 
  Being the backbone of the National Front, UMNO [United 
Malays 
National Organization] is certainly very enthusiastic about 
taking part in the coming Sabah elections as a means to measure 
its strength in Sabah after it first entered the state in 1991. 
  Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir's remarks that the National 
Front 
is ready to run in all the 48 state constituencies shows that 
the ruling coalition not only wants to test the waters, but also 
to wrest Sabah back from the Sabah United Party, which won the 
elections in 1985. This is not an impossible task.

<F P=106> [By Nate Thayer: "Shakeup in KR Hierarchy"] </F>
  [Excerpts] There is a popular adage among Khmer Rouge (KR) 
cadre: "If you keep a secret a secret, you have already won 50 
percent of the victory." As a result of an almost fanatical 
commitment to keeping secret the inner workings of their 
organization, almost nothing is known by outsiders about the 
leadership of one of the world's most resilient guerrilla 
movements. But two of the KR's most powerful and prominent of 
their small group of top leaders have been purged over policy 
differences since the signing of the Paris Peace Accords, the 
POST has learned. 
  Ieng Sary -- long time member of the Party standing 
committee, Foreign Minister during the KR rule, in charge of the 
Party's economic portfolio, and liaison for all Chinese military 
and financial aid until the Paris Agreements --has been stripped 
of power in a bitter break within the organization. [passage 
omitted] 
  Son Sen -- also a member of the Party standing committee, 
the 
Minister of Defence, and one of the two official KR members of 
the Supreme National Council [SNC] set up by the Paris Peace 
agreements to administer the country prior to election -- was 
relieved of his duties in May 1992 after losing a high level 
dispute over whether the KR should pull out of the UN organized 
peace plan. He supported entering into the phase of the peace 
agreements that called for the four warring factions in June 
1992 to demobilize their armies. [passage omitted] 
  The revelation of Son Sen's dismissal from his position as 
KR 
Minister of Defence is particularly important as it is the first 
firm evidence of high level debate within the leadership over 
whether to pull out of the UN sponsored peace process and 
elections in May 1992. [passage omitted] 
  Purges of senior officials within the KR are of course part 
of their legacy. Indeed, a majority of the top officials of the 
KR who came to power in the party and state organs after their 
197 victory were executed during their 3 and 1/2 year rule. 
There is no indication that disagreements among leaders are 
resolved by execution in recent years. 
  Son Sen was days away from being arrested and most certainly 
executed in late 1978 during the waning days of the KR regime. 
He was saved ironically, by the Vietnamese invasion in late 
1978, according to recent analysis of confessions of other party 
cadre at Tuol Sleng prison, Cambodia scholar Stephen Heder told 
the POST. 
  A former deputy Prime Minister in charge of defence during 
the KR years in power and an alternate on the Standing 
Committee, Son Sen is a graduate of the Sorbonne and was a 
director of one of Phnom Penh's most prestigious universities 
before fleeing to the "maquis" in 1963. While defence minister 
throughout the 1980's of the guerrilla army, he began to rise 
further in influence in 1987 when the KR prepared him for future 
political role as they prepared for a political solution to the 
war. [passage omitted] 
  Son Sen argued, during April and May 1992, that the KR's 
future also depended on remaining sincere in the eyes of the 
world for desiring a peaceful, political solution to Cambodia's 
conflict and participating in a democratically elected coalition 
government. To pull out would undermine the groups already rock 
bottom credibility both domestically and internationally which 
the KR continue to see as vital to reestablishing their ability 
to play a role in future Cambodian affairs. 
  This period also marked the dismantling of a carefully 
developed group of tactical and strategic military alliances 
with FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia], the KPNLF [Khmer 
People's National Liberation Front], China, the United States, 
and other powers. The absence of this decade old alliance, 
which provided political credibility to the KR cause, left the 
group dangerously isolated and vulnerable. Some leaders saw a 
pullout from the peace process as resulting in isolation they 
believed would cause an unacceptable degree of political damage. 
  These arguments did not prevail during high level meetings 
of 
the leadership held near the Thai border in May 1992. 
  As a result of his purge, sources say Son Sen went through a 
period of what appears to be reeducation from June to December 
1992, when he is said to have agreed that he had been mistaken 
in his initial views. 
  His change of heart came when Sihanouk himself in December 
1992 began to publicly condemn the UN operation and indicate 
that a provisional government should be formed under Sihanouk's 
leadership and elections perhaps abandoned. Internally, the KR 
interpreted this as Sihanouk entering into an alliance with them 
to oppose the UN operation and elections. 
  Son Sen is expected to play a role in the future in KR 
political activities, sources say, but his influence remains far 
less than before and he no longer has a military role. 
  Ieng Sary's demise came in 1992 after years of friction 
within the party. He was in charge of foreign relations during 
the KR rule, and most of the intellectuals who came back to 
Cambodia after the KR victory in 1975 were under his charge. 
Hundreds perished, and others, distrusted by the Party, were 
kept in reeducation camps or virtual prisoners doing menial work 
in state ministries. 
  After the KR fled to the jungle in 1979, Ieng Sary caused a 
major rift within the Party by acknowledging to a journalist the 
existence of the Tuol Sleng torture center in which at least 
16,000 people died -- mostly party cadres and their families. 
  He also appeared to criticize the leadership by saying he 
was 
out of the country when certain senior KR officials were 
arrested and executed. This was seen as a breach of solidarity 
within the KR who hold firmly to collective decision making that 
strictly prohibits independent public statements by leaders on 
political and policy issues. But Ieng Sary had the support of 
the Chinese, who insisted that all covert Chinese assistance -- 
both military and financial -- be passed through him. As a 
result he was in charge of the Finance portfolio and 
disbursement of weapons, which gave him significant power. But 
he is known to have had several disputes with Pol Pot in the 
late 1980's, and angered many field commanders and intellectuals 
for his autocratic style and abrasive personality. When the 
signing of the Paris agreements ended all Chinese direct support 
to the faction, Ieng Sary's influence diminished. 
  His headquarters, along the Phnom Malai escarpment on the 
Thai border, was also the center for KR diplomatic operations 
and housed the group's intellectuals and their families. 
Intellectuals, many who hold him in contempt, moved their 
headquarters and families to another KR base in 1993, further 
isolating Ieng Sary. 
  While he still controls a small swath of territory in 
western 
Cambodia, he no longer controls significant troops or money, and 
appears to have been removed from the standing committee. Some 
sources say he retains an "observer status" on the standing 
committee. KR sources say that he has permanently lost 
influence within the decision making structure of the party and 
army. 
  While Pol Pot is said to remain in full overall control of 
the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea and its political wing 
-- the Party of Democratic Kampuchea -- through his position as 
chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of 
the Party, there has also emerged a group of younger military 
commanders and intellectuals who have risen in influence and are 
being groomed for power. 
  While the KR officially dissolved their communist party in 
December 1981, and announced they supported a "liberal 
parliamentary democracy," most analysts dismissed the claim. 
They said it was designed to attract united front allies among 
other Cambodian factions who also opposed the new Vietnamese 
controlled government in Cambodia. It was also seen as an 
attempt to draw western political support for a coalition 
anti-Vietnamese resistance group that formed along the Thai 
border to wage war against the Vietnamese and their installed 
government. 
  Similarly dismissed were KR public announcements in the 
mid-1980 that the three top ranking members of Party -- Pol Pot, 
Nuon Chea, and Ta Mok -- also "retired." Evidence is strong 
that most of the same "old guard" leadership that comprised the 
last official standing committee before 1981 remain in control 
of the organization today continuing to carry out essentially 
the same functions they have since the late 1970's. 
  Pol Pot remains a highly effective and respected figure 
among the top cadres, who view him as the one man who can bridge 
differences among other leaders. He spends much of his time 
developing political strategy. He rarely travels to bases and 
is said to almost never meet cadre under the rank of division 
commander. Described as a "genius" by his supporters, he is 
said to be a remarkable orator and occasionally delivers 
lectures. He still officially holds the title of director of 
research at a KR military "institute." Many cadre worry that if 
the 66 year old leader were to die there would be no one to 
replace him and major infighting could break out within the 
leadership. 
  Also remaining in the same position, is the little known 
Nuon 
Chea, who has been described as Pol Pot's "alter ego." He fled 
to the jungle with Pol Pot in 1963, and has made one public 
appearance since then -- in the late 1970's to a Danish 
communist party. He is in charge of party organization, deputy 
supreme commander of the armed forces, and number 2 on the 
standing committee. 
  It is Ta Mok, the number three on the standing committee, 
who 
has seen a significant rise of influence since the Paris 
agreements. He serves as chief of the general staff of the KR 
army and military commander of the northern region. But when, 
in 1992, Son Sen gave up control of 6 Divisions under his 
control, they fell under the command of Ta Mok, who now controls 
at least 12 Divisions and is responsible for KR cadre and troops 
from the northwestern Thai border, throughout the north and the 
entire eastern region abutting Vietnam. This gives him control 
of perhaps 70 percent of the KR army and most of the country. 
  The one-legged commander is of peasant origin and controlled 
the southwestern military region during the KR years. It was 
troops under his command who carried out campaigns against 
"internal enemies," attacks on Vietnam, and arrests of other KR 
leaders before the Vietnamese invasion. As a result he has 
earned the nickname "the butcher." But despite his fierce 
reputation among foreigners and other Cambodians, Ta Mok 
engenders tremendous loyalty among his forces. His troops are 
said to [be] well paid, fed, and armed, and their morale remains 
high and their commitment to the KR cause strong. But as would 
be natural in any organization with aging leaders, a new, 
younger group of political and military leaders are currently 
rising in power within the organization. In 1987, according to 
KR sources, Pol Pot issued a directive to groom this younger 
generation of leaders. 
  On the military side, a group of about 7 commanders -- 
division level or higher -- now form a collective committee that 
proposes military tactics and strategy which is submitted for 
approval to the standing committee. 
  In their 40's and 50's, virtually all of this group fled to 
the jungle with Pol Pot to join the underground revolution 
between 1963 and 1967. Many were students or teachers in urban 
areas when they joined the movement, but have spent virtually 
their entire adult lives in the jungle. 
  They hold significant power because of the trust given to 
them by the leadership, and, importantly, because they control 
"concrete forces." It is these leaders who have long exerted 
direct control over troops, administer civilians in their 
"liberated zones", are trained in and conduct "political work" 
among their rank and file and the peasantry, and disburse 
funding and oversee economic activity in their zones of control. 
Their practical experience gives them as much the role of 
"governor" as military commander in the 20 percent of Cambodia 
controlled by the KR. 
  Included in the group of 7 are important family ties as 
well. 
So Hong, the commander of Military Zone 1002, is a nephew of 
Pol Pot and was a senior official in the KR Foreign Ministry 
during their years in power. Mit Nikorn, who was elevated to 
the position of commander in charge of all western military 
forces in 1992 with at least 5 divisions under his command, is 
the younger brother of Son Sen. And Ta Mok has at least one son 
and one son-in-law who are powerful division level field 
commanders. 
  Family ties play a vital role in Cambodian culture and, 
consequently, in access to power in Cambodia politics, including 
the KR. Son Sen's wife is in charge of propaganda for the 
Party. Ieng Sary's wife, Ieng Thirit, was minister of social 
affairs during the KR rule and continued to wield significant 
influence until her decline accompanied her husband's in recent 
months. She also suffers from ill health. 
  She, significantly, is also the sister of Khieu Ponnary, Pol 
Pot's wife until the mid-1980's. Khieu Ponnary suffered a 
mental breakdown in the late 1980's and was divorced from Pol 
Pot. He has taken a new wife by which he has two young 
children. It is generally agreed by observers that the severing 
of direct family links between Pol Pot and Ieng Sary after the 
divorce played an important role in the purging of Ieng Sary. 
  There are three primary power bases that now make up the KR. 
Aside from the all powerful standing committee and the younger 
collective of military commanders, there is a group of younger 
political cadre who analyze, carry out, and formulate political 
policy for the KR. Made up of about 15 highly educated 
intellectuals who have been with the movement since the 1960s -- 
and a lesser amount [in] the early 1970's -- they have mostly 
served in KR diplomatic posts and advisors to the top leaders 
until the Paris agreements. 
  Many senior intellectuals have quietly left the movement in 
the 1980's complaining that the organization remained hostile to 
real change and they were only being used to put an "acceptable 
face" to the KR. 
  In Nov. 1992, the KR announced the formation of the Great 
National Union Party and listed 10 intellectuals as its founding 
members. Headed by Khieu Samphan and Son Sen, all the men are 
well known technocrats who have been with the organization since 
before they came to power in 1975. Its members -- all with 
advanced degrees from European universities -- include one 
lawyer, three economists, one mathematician, four engineers, and 
an educator. 
  In the announcement of the new party, there was no mention 
of 
the hard-line figures that are said to remain in real control of 
the party. They announced that the founders of the new party 
would play the leading role for them in any national 
reconciliation government that emerged from the peace process. 
  While dismissed by most scholars and analysts as merely a 
front group with no real decision making authority independent 
from the old guard remaining in the jungle, they nevertheless 
have seen an increase in power and influence as the KR 
increasingly becomes a political movement. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 3 (ANTARA) -- Representatives of APEC 
(Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) member countries at a 
meeting here Thursday agreed to elect the United States as 
chairman of the forum's Budget and Administration Committee. The 
meeting, officially called APEC Senior Officials Meeting 
(APEC-SOM), is the first of a series of four scheduled to 
prepare an APEC ministerial conference in November. With the 
agreement reached at Thursday's meeting, the United States would 
be the first country to lead the forum's Budget and 
Administration Committee. 
  Saodah Syahruddin, an Indonesian delegate to the APEC-SOM, 
said the United States was one of three nominees for the 
position. The meeting eventually chose the United States in 
view of its position as former chairman of APEC's first summit 
meeting which took place in Seattle in November last year. 
  Mrs. Syahruddin, who is director of developing countries 
economic cooperation at Indonesia's Foreign Ministry, explained 
that the meeting also agreed to make it a convention that the 
chairman of the last APEC summit meeting automatically becomes 
chairman of APEC's Budget and Administration Committee for the 
subsequent term. 
  This meant that after Indonesia acts as chairman of the 
second APEC summit meeting scheduled for later this year, it 
would thereafter also serve as the forum's Budget and 
Administration Committee leader, she said. Mrs. Syahruddin said 
delegates at Thursday's meeting earlier considered two other 
ways of determining who would lead the Budget and Administration 
Committee. 
  One proposal would have the chairman of a coming APEC summit 
become the committee leader. The other would require the 
chairman of the committee to be appointed based on an election 
held annually. "But finally, all participants agreed that the 
chairman of the last APEC summit meeting should serve as 
chairman of the committee. This will be a permanent procedure," 
she said. 
  Mrs. Syahruddin also said APEC will not admit new members 
during the next three years. The question of admitting new 
members would be studied first, she added. Currently APEC has 17 
members, namely the six countries grouped in ASEAN -- Brunei 
Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, 
Thailand, plus Australia, Canada, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, 
Korea, Hongkong, Papua New Guinea, Japan, the United States, and 
Mexico. At the Seattle summit, it was agreed that Chile would be 
admitted as a member at the summit due to be convened in 
Indonesia next November. 
  The APEC-SOM meeting opened last Wednesday and will end on 
Friday. It is being attended by officials of its member 
countries and three observers.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 3 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Indonesia is 
planning to ratify the prohibition of chemical weapons 
convention by the end of 1994, a senior Foreign Ministry 
official announced. 
  Hasan Wirayuda, the ministry's director of International 
Organization Affairs, told a press conference here Wednesday: 
"The House of Representatives will have to discuss this matter 
before okaying the plan and hopefully the discussion can be 
completed by the end of this year." 
  Wirayuda said that Indonesia had taken part in tough 
international negotiations on the phasing out of chemical 
weapons since they began in 1980 up to their conclusion in 1992 
although Indonesia did not possess chemical weapons. 
  He added that Indonesia's participation, which manifested 
the 
country's concern for national and regional security, was 
significant because it was the largest country in Southeast Asia 
and now chairing the Non-aligned Movement. 
  Vested with such national, regional, and global 
responsibilities Indonesia had no option but become a party to 
the convention, a position enabling it along with the 
international community to strive after the abolition of 
chemical weapons, and supervise the ban on their proliferation 
through the convention's system of verification, he said. 
  He added that Indonesia had formed an inter-departmental 
committee assigned to prepare for the ratification. The 
committee was made up of representatives of the Ministries of 
Industry, Defence and Security, Trade, and Health, the Armed 
Forces Headquarters, the Agency for the Assessment and 
Application of Technology (BPPT) and the surveyor company 
Surveyor Indonesia Co. Ltd. 
  The visiting executive secretary of the Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat, Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical 
Weapons (PTS-OPCW), Ian Kenyon, meanwhile has welcomed 
Indonesia's plan to ratify the convention. At present, only four 
of its 154 signatory countries had ratified it. 
  Signatories to the convention to date were the United 
States, 
Russia, all Western European countries, all former socialist 
counrties in Eastern Europe, and a number of Latin American and 
Asian countries, Wirayuda said.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 1 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Defense and 
Security Minister Edi Sudrajat said that arms purchases being 
made by some Southeast and East Asian countries were not 
motivated by offensive designs. 
  "So far, we do not think that certain countries in Southeast 
and East Asia which recently acquired new armament, have a 
tendency to be offensive. But I have no idea about what will 
happen to (?them) 20 years from now," the minister told 
legislators here on Tuesday. The retired general said that the 
arms purchases were only intended to replace old weaponry and to 
keep up with new technology. 
  "Just like us, we bought a few F-16 fighters with the 
purpose 
of keeping abreast of new technology," he said, adding that the 
number was actually far from sufficient compared with 
Indonesia's concrete defence needs. Sudrajat said that rapid 
economic growth in the two regions was among the major factors 
that had prompted the arms purchasing actions. 
  He said that some East European as well as Central Asian 
countries were very aggressive and innovative in offering 
products of their weapon industries. "Although in technological 
terms the arms they offer cannot compete with those made by 
Western countries, some Asian countries with limited funds for 
armament seem very interested in the East European and Central 
Asian products," he added. 
  The minister rejected the suggestion that the arms 
purchasing 
activity of the Southeast and East Asian countries amounted to 
an "armament race." 
  During the hearing led by the chairman of the commission 
dealing with security affairs, Mrs. Aisyah Amini, the minister 
also touched on the "single majority concept" which had of late 
become a widely-debated topic in the country.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 1 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Former East 
Timorese separatist leader Xanana Gusmao may be moved from his 
present jail in Jakarta to a prison on isolated Nusakambangan 
Island "if all conditions for the transfer are met," a senior 
law-enforcing official said Tuesday. 
  Deputy for intelligence to the attorney general Sukarno was 
commenting to newsmen about public suggestions that Gusmao 
should be held in a more isolated place after he recently 
succeeded in sending a letter overseas protesting his sentencing 
by an Indonesian court of justice. 
  "If all conditions for such a transfer are met, we can move 
Xanana to Nusakambangan Island," Sukarno said after attending a 
ceremony marking the installation of a number of new officials 
at the Attorney General's Office. Sukarno, however, did not 
clarify what the conditions were. Gusmao is currently serving a 
20-year sentence in Jakarta's Cipinang penitentiary. 
  He was tried and sentenced to a life-long jail term by a 
court of justice in Dili, East Timor's provincial capital, for 
acts of armed rebellion committed since 1976. President 
Suharto, however, later used his power of pardon to reduce the 
sentence to 20 years. 
  Sukarno said even if Gusmao was actually moved to 
Nusakambangan, he would continue to be allowed to send letters 
abroad. Nusakambangan, an island off the coast of Cilacap on the 
southern coast of Central Java Province, is the location of a 
maximum security prison usually reserved for convicts serving 
long sentences. Sukarno also categorically denied rumours 
alleging that Gusmao would eventually be freed before completing 
his jail term. "Don't believe this hearsay. We have no plan at 
all to set him free," he said. 
  East Timor is the youngest Indonesian province. It was 
colonized by Portugal for 450 years before it integrated with 
Indonesia in 1976.

  [Text] The peace talks between the government and the 
RAM/SFP/YOU [Reform the Armed Forces Movement/Soldiers of the 
Filipino People/Young Officers Union] will continue to be 
suspended unless six of its detained members are released. This 
was revealed by RAM/SFP/YOU spokesman General Edgardo Abenina. 
Abenina said that the continued detention of its members is a 
violation of the agreement made between his group and the 
government last 22 December 1992. The agreement states that all 
members of RAM/SFP/YOU will be freed temporarily while their 
cases are still being heard. Abenina, however, expressed hope 
that the government is sincere in its peace initiative. Abenina 
added that the government is not clear on the procedures it is 
implementing for the peace talks.

  [Text] The National Democratic Front [NDF] today reiterated 
that they will remain open for the resumption of the peace talks 
with the government. Nevertheless, Luis Jalandoni of NDF 
emphasized that the peace talks should not be limited by an 
executive order. Jalandoni said that the Hague Declaration 
should be the guide for the talks. As in the previous 
statements, however, the government panel stressed that 
Executive Order 125 issued by the government is in accordance 
with the Constitution, which sets limits on any peace talks 
undertaken by the government.

  [Excerpts] The head of the investment promotion board 
yesterday expressed confidence that Thai industries will survive 
even though the government has had to alter its promotional 
programme to comply with a multilateral agreement reached in the 
Uruguay Round of trade talks. 
  In compliance with the terms of the Trade Related to 
Investment Measures (Trims) agreement which was developed under 
the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(Gatt), the Board of Investment (BoI) is among other things 
cancelling the export privileges it granted to manufacturing 
plants located in investment Zone 2 within five years of the 
enactment of the Gatt agreements. 
  In order to retain their privileges they will have to 
relocate their plants from Zone 2 covering 10 provinces in the 
central region, to more remote areas in Zone 3. 
  During an interview yesterday Sathaphon Kawitanon, BoI 
secretary-general, discounted concerns about local industries. 
He believes the local industries should be strong enough to 
stand on their own feet. Moreover, BoI is considering a 
reformulation of the tariffs charged to the local 
auto-assembling industry, along with a BoI plan to make 
industry-wide the tax treatment granted as an exception to the 
Mitsubishi assembly plant. [passage omitted] 
  Sathaphon said in 1985 the BoI had to introduce the 
investment incentives to promote foreign investment in order to 
boost the export substitution industry and the local economy 
after the devaluation of the baht. He said the current situation 
does not require such government incentives, however, because 
local industries have gained wider economies of scale. 
  "The export requirement is no longer necessary," Sathaphon 
said. He noted, however, that the government might have to 
maintain the export requirement in certain industrial sectors. 
  The new wave of Japanese investment is likely to be aimed at 
supporting industries, he said. The Board of Investment has 
forecast that American and Japanese investors are likely to 
focus on the automobile industry. 
  He said the Board of Investment, therefore, plans to grant 
more incentives to the automobile industry. Officials have 
already completed a draft reformulation of a new tariff 
structure for the industry, but Sathaphon declined to elaborate 
on the plan. 
  Sathaphon said only that the continuation of the privileges 
would depend on key determinants such as proper tariff rates for 
the auto-assembling industry and the differences between 
investment conditions for plants under the BoI plan and plants 
without investment privileges. 
  Sathaphon predicted that the next wave of Japanese 
industrial 
investment will be mainly in small- to medium-size plants, 
because all the major Japanese producers already have plants in 
Thailand. 
  He added that last year Japanese investments in Thailand 
were 
greater in value than their investments in any other country in 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
  The recession in Japan should not have a major impact on its 
investment in Thailand, as "during the peak period, Japanese 
investments here accounted for only two per cent of total 
Japanese investment," he said.

  [Text] SUVA, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Any prospect of a coalition 
after next month's election between between Fiji's governing 
Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) and the Indian dominated 
opposition has been ruled out by both sides, former opposition 
leader Jai Ram Reddy made clear Tuesday. 
  SVT leader and outgoing Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka told 
a 
political rally here Monday he would not entertain a coalition 
with an Indian political party if his party won the general 
election. Rabuka blamed a "bad experience" with the 
Indian-dominated Fiji Labour Party (FLP) after the 1992 general 
election, when it supported his candidacy for the prime 
ministership. 
  Rabuka said FLP leader Mahendra Chaudhry had made 
uncompromising demands on the SVT which he later could not 
honour. These included the review of what Chaudry described as 
the "racist 1990 Constitution" which gave indigenous Fijians a 
parliamentary majority of 37 seats in a 70-seat House of 
Rpresentatives and the abolition of a value added tax (VAT). 
  National Federation Party (NFP) leader Jai Ram Reddy 
responded sharply Tuesday saying it was Rabuka who had talked 
about coalition with the NFP in the past. Reddy, who was leader 
of the opposition in the last House of Representatives, had 
supported Rabuka's plan for a government of national unity 
announced in November 1992. A committee of which Reddy was a 
member sat on several occasions to look into the issue but 
nothing eventuated. 
  In his response Tuesday, Reddy said in a statement that his 
party's priority was "to secure as many Indian seats as possible 
and to press for the review of the 1990 Constitution through 
dialogue with the Fijian leaders." Reddy said he had repeatedly 
warned since 1992 of the dangers of becoming locked under the 
present constitution into a coalition which he said could become 
"embarrassing if no progress was made on the review (of the 
constitution) satisfactory to the party." 
  It was therefore academic for Rabuka to rule out a coalition 
with the NFP, Reddy said. "The NFP has no intention of repeating 
the mistake that the Fiji Labour Party made in 1992," he added.

  [Text] WELLINGTON, Feb 3 (AFP) -- The cheap British sale of 
six second-hand navy frigates to Pakistan illustrated that New 
Zealand was committed to a "dud deal" in having to buy two 
expensive new frigates from Australia, a government member of 
parliament, Nick Smith, claimed here Thursday. 
  A previous Labour government committed New Zealand to buying 
two Australian-built frigates at around 600 million New Zealand 
dollars (334 million US) apiece. There is also an option on a 
third vessel to replace the four aging frigates which make up 
the navy's front line. 
  Smith earlier said the Royal Navy had sold six Type 21 
Amazon 
frigates to Pakistan at a cost of only one million pounds 
sterling (668,000 US dollars) each. "This shows what a dud deal 
we are getting in paying over 600 million dollars each for the 
Anzac frigates," he said. 
  But Defence Minister Warren Cooper said Smith's comments 
showed "all the brilliance of hindsight. When the decision was 
taken in the late 1980s to go ahead with the Australia-New 
Zealand frigates project, there were no suitable ships being 
offered, including those now sold to Pakistan. "There is little 
to be gained by claims of Rolls Royce solutions when second-hand 
ships were simply not on the market back then," Cooper said. 
  He noted the Australian deal was signed by the 
administration 
of Prime Minister David Lange which had also cut military ties 
with the United States through its ban on nuclear armed or 
powered warships. "We've got a ship in the New Zealand Navy that 
was given to us by the Americans. If we had a better 
relationship with the Americans they would replace that ship for 
nothing. We know that. We've cut off our options," Cooper told 
Radio New Zealand. 
  He said if second-hand ships were considered it was 
necessary 
to know what was on them. "While I've been Minister of Defence 
I've had at least six people come to me as agents for what we 
could call grid military equipment. They've been acting out of 
Russia, particularly because the Russians seem to have all that 
equipment. 
  "They've wanted to sell us helicopters and aircraft 
carriers, 
and I had to be pretty careful that I wasn't in the situation 
where I had to ask the taxpayer to pay for big capital works 
programmes when we could find things that were available off the 
shelf, maybe a few years old, so we could put them in the 
defence forces. I made absolutely certain there weren't bargains 
out there that we could use that we were denying ourselves," 
Cooper said.

  [Text] Yesterday, North Korea sent a statement to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] saying it rejected 
full-scope [chonmyon] inspections, as reported by Japan's NHK 
Broadcast in a Berlin-datelined story. 
  By sending its 31 January statement to the IAEA saying that 
it will withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty unless 
the United States stops its scheme to crush the Pyongyang side, 
North Korea stated that the fact that the United States and the 
IAEA urge North Korea to receive full-scope inspections of its 
nuclear facilities violates the spirit of the North Korea-U.S. 
agreement, and revealed that it will not negotiate further with 
the IAEA unless the agreement mapped out in New York is kept. 
  Responding to this, IAEA spokesman Meyer said the IAEA does 
not regard a protest document sent by North Korea as an official 
answer and that the IAEA is still waiting for North Korea's 
official response to its specification inquiring about the place 
and schedule for nuclear inspections.

  [Text] Berlin, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) on Thursday denied the press reports that 
North Korea had informed the IAEA of its rejection of any 
nuclear inspection. IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said his agency 
had received no official notification from North Korea on 
Pyongyang's reported rejection of IAEA inspection of their 
nuclear facilities. Some press reports indicated that North 
Korea formally informed the IAEA on Feb. 2 that they were 
rejecting IAEA inspection. 
  Meyer said that the North Korean Embassy in Vienna 
fascimiled 
to the IAEA on Feb. 2 a copy of their Foreign Ministry 
statement of Feb. 1 on the issue of nuclear talks with the 
United States. But, this was part of their routine information 
activities, not any formal message to the IAEA on their 
rejection of nuclear inspection, he said. 
  The facsimiled item did not contain anything other than the 
three-page full text of Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry statement 
as reported by the North KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, Meyer added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- American evangelist 
Billy Graham said Thursday that a secret message from North 
Korean leader Kim Il-song will reach U.S. President Bill 
Clinton on Friday. Graham, fresh from a visit to Pyongyang from 
Jan. 27 to Feb. 1, said the message was being delivered to 
Clinton by a church associate at a press conference in Hong Kong. 
  The evangelist said he sent the associate to Washington 
ahead 
of him so that Clinton can receive the message by Friday, 
showing the urgency he attached to Kim's message. Graham said 
it was in reply to an oral message from Clinton which he had 
passed on to North Korea's paramount leader, but declined to say 
whether Kim's was oral or in writing. The renowned preacher 
said he spent more than three hours with Kim and talked about 
issues ranging from religion to politics, hinting that Clinton 
had touched on the North Korean nuclear issue in his oral 
message. He did not, however, elaborate on the content of the 
messages, nor that of his talks with Kim. He said he had 
discussed his planned visit to the Stalinist country earlier 
with Clinton, who strongly backed the idea.

<F P=106> [By Washington-based correspondent Chong Il-hwa] </F>
  [Text] According to high-ranking U.S. officials on 2 
February, Pak Kil-yon, North Korean permanent representative to 
the United Nations, has been invited to the national breakfast 
prayer meeting to be held on 3 February in Washington and there 
is a possibility that Pak will encounter U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, who will also be attending the prayer meeting. 
  According to a high-ranking U.S. State Department official, 
the State Department approved a one-day-two-night Washington 
visit by Representative Pak and he is scheduled to attend the 
national breakfast prayer meeting to be held on the morning of 3 
February. The official said that an encounter was possible 
between President Clinton and Representative Pak at the prayer 
meeting. 
  Representative Pak's Washington visit to attend the 
breakfast 
prayer meeting is noteworthy because it is taking place at a 
time when tension in U.S.-North Korea relations has risen anew 
with North Korea's warning that it may not withhold withdrawal 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and with the plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK. 
  White House officials said: "President Clinton is scheduled 
to attend the 3 February morning prayer meeting but how long he 
will stay and with whom he will meet has yet to be decided upon." 
  A White House official said: "With the current situation in 
which negotiation between North Korea and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency is at stalemate, it would be very 
meaningful for President Clinton and Representative Pak to meet 
even briefly." 
  The U.S. State Department gave advance approval for 
Representative Pak's Washington visit because the activities and 
travel of North Korean diplomats to the United Nations, 
including Representative Pak, are restricted to a 25 mile-radius 
in New York.

<F P=106> [By Cho Se-hyon] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- "Just because he has a 
loud voice and aggressive manner, it doesn't necessarily mean 
that he can accomplish a lot. We shouldn't approach 
inter-Korean relations including the North Korean nuclear issue 
in confrontational ways or regard them as a zero-sum game. We 
have to look at Russia and China from a comprehensive viewpoint." 
  These are some of the points made by Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu on Tuesday when he presided over a conference of heads 
of overseas South Korean missions. The remarks by Han, a former 
political science professor and internationally noted columnist, 
have attracted keen interest as he attempted to sum up problems 
with South Korea's diplomacy and raised points for the diplomats 
to reflect on. Han, who took over the diplomatic command post 
with the inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam's administration 
in February last year, was seen by many as issuing a warning 
that the nation's diplomats must cast aside their mannerisms and 
make a fresh start. 
  He said a lack of long-term vision, planning and 
extemporaneousness, as well as rigidity and wild talking are 
aspects that characterized past South Korean diplomacy. After 
casting aside these characteristics, Han suggested the nation's 
envoys should pursue practical, predictable, forward-looking, 
self-confident and substantial diplomacy. Above all, Han 
counselled his diplomats to stop pursuing confrontational 
diplomacy with North Korea. 
  If there is one phrase that sums up South Korean diplomacy 
other than "new diplomacy," he said, it has to be "practical 
diplomacy." 
  Han noted that some are now saying it is the Chinese 
president's turn to visit South Korea since former president No 
Tae-u visited China in 1992. But under the "new diplomacy," Han 
said, President Kim will visit China in March, without being 
bound by protocol and formality. This, he explained, is 
practical diplomacy. 
  The foreign minister then suggested "a diplomacy that can 
anticipate the future," and "a flexible diplomacy" as desirable 
directions after practical diplomacy. 
  Rather than panicking when an event unexpectedly takes 
place, 
Han urged the diplomats to carry out their work with mid- and 
long-term prospects in mind so that the outcome can be 
anticipated. 
  Han said there appears to be widespread misunderstanding of 
the term "internationalization," which is becoming so popular 
these days. 
  The belief that internationalization is needed only to 
strengthen the country's economic competitiveness is not only 
one-dimensional but also extremely myopic, he said. 
  In addition to short-term and practical purposes, the term 
internationalization must be understood to mean Koreans' efforts 
to establish a definite position in the world and pursue 
spiritual and material well-being, Han said. 
  On North Korea and the unification problem, Han said, "we 
have to realize that if North Korea managed to gain some benefit 
from its negotiations on the nuclear issue, it would also be a 
plus for us." 
  "We have to adopt this kind of idea as a premise for our 
inter-Korean and unification diplomacy," he said. 
  The overriding consideration in South Korea's efforts to 
help 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue has to be prevention of 
the worst possible scenario, Han said, adding that South Korea 
must adopt "a firm, yet flexible" attitude. 
  Han mentioned globalism, diversification, 
multi-dimensionalism, regional cooperation and 
future-orientation as the five fundamentals for the nation's 
"new diplomacy." 
  "All these problems will become our problems in the near 
future," Han said. "That is why we have to take a comprehensive 
attitude toward them all."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "North Korea's Nuclear Intent Must Be </F>
Reexamined"] 
  [Text] How should we cope with North Korea's nuclear 
weapons, if it possesses them? Is present negotiation strategy 
to prevent North Korea from manufacturing nuclear weapons still 
effective? On what basis is the government encouraged to have 
confidence that North Korea has no nuclear weapons at present? 
  We have no specific objection to the fact that diplomatic 
negotiation methods are the most effective for the solution of 
the North Korean nuclear issue. This is why we hoped for success 
in the U.S.-North Korean nuclear negotiations. We have not 
discarded, even now, the hope that our expectation will be met 
at last. Negotiations should proceed with flexibility, and such 
flexibility should be based on reciprocity. This condition, 
however, will become meaningless if North Korea cancels its 
withholding its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT], threatened by the North Korean Foreign Ministry, 
becomes a reality. 
  The logic that one should be even more flexible in this case 
may sound persuasive. In other words, just as the chairman of 
the opposition party urged, we should reject the imposition of 
sanctions on North Korea and should try to bring North Korea to 
the negotiating table. Based on this, however, we will be in a 
strange position of having to block the resolution for sanctions 
in the event the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the 
UN Security Council after inspection negotiations are ruptured 
between the International Atomic Energy Agency and North Korea. 
We do not believe that this is what the government has in mind. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that "we will maintain a 
flexible, yet resolute attitude toward the nuclear issue." We 
would like to interpret his remarks as expression of the will to 
actively join the resolution for sanctions by the UN Security 
Council, if it is necessary and indispensable. The problem is 
North Korea's attitude. We must judge, first, whether North 
Korea's threat of withdrawal from the NPT is another negotiating 
card or expression of its will not to discard nuclear 
development. 
  For this judgment, one should not be self-righteous but 
should assume a cool, realistic standpoint. In view of serious 
unfavorable effects on our security in case negotiations on the 
North Korean nuclear issue go wrong, one should listen to the 
other side's allegation. Therefore, one should ponder over the 
attitude of the government to worry about the possibility of 
heightened tension when Patriot missiles are deployed to the 
U.S. Forces in the ROK. This is because negotiations are 
possible only when one's defensive posture is strong. 
  What presents an even more serious problem is true aspects 
of 
North Korea's nuclear development. There cannot be any clear, 
accurate answer to this question. No one can be definitely 
sure that North Korea has no nuclear weapons. This is why the 
U.S. administration, not to mention the U.S. Congress, is 
leaning toward a hard-line policy. Should we consider this 
merely as military egoism of the United States? In the event it 
becomes suddenly known that North Korea possesses nuclear 
weapons, the present negotiation method must certainly be 
reexamined. 
  Our suspicion is increasing as to why North Korea is so 
persistently refusing IAEA's full-scope inspection, even so far 
as warning of its cancellation of withholding its withdrawal 
from the NPT. Nevertheless, the split in our national opinion is 
deepening. This is indeed deplorable and troubling.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Ambassador 
to the United States Han Sung-su said on Thursday there is no 
difference between Seoul and Washington's positions on the North 
Korean nuclear problem. Han, who is attending the annual 
conference of Korean ambassadors and envoys here, said the two 
nations' relationship is strong enough to weather any attempt to 
destroy it. He expected that the North Korean nuclear problem 
will be discussed by the United Nations Security Council after 
March 21. 
  If the Board of Governors' meeting of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), slated for March 21, comes to the 
conclusion that the continuity of North Korea's nuclear 
safeguards can no longer be assured, the issue will have to be 
discussed by the U.N. Security Council, he said. 
  "Then, the council will discuss everything about the (North 
Korean nuclear) problem including sanctions against North 
Korea," he said. 
  He urged Pyongyang to make a rational judgement, saying that 
the North Koreans themselves know very well that the issue will 
be transferred to the U.N. Security Council if the IAEA Board 
of Governors' meeting fails to solve the problem. He also 
confirmed that there are no problems with South Korean security. 
He denied U.S. reports that tension on the Korean peninsula is 
mounting, saying that South Korea's security has not 
deteriorated and is in fact no different from the past. 
  Meanwhile, discussions on deployment of U.S. Patriot 
missiles in South Korea are under way between the South Korean 
and U.S. Governments, and the two have agreed that deployment of 
the anti-missile missiles should not affect the IAEA-North 
Korean negotiations, Han said. 
  The reason why the IAEA and North Korea cannot narrow their 
differences is not the possibility that Patriot missiles will be 
deployed in South Korea, but that they differ on technical 
problems related to nuclear inspections, he added.

<F P=106> [Article by Yi Chong-hyon: "The Two Faces of the U.S.--the </F>
Police and the Arms Dealer"] 
  [Text] The "world's police" that always talks about peace 
and imposing sanctions on countries selling weapons, the United 
States is, in fact, the greatest arms trader. The United 
States' sensitivity to the export of weapons by other countries 
is part of their sophisticated strategy to sell their "own 
commodities." 
  The WALL STREET JOURNAL of 28 January reported that "since 
the end of the Cold War, the United States has become the 
greatest exporter of conventional weapons" and that "in 
particular, the United States achieved record weapons sales of 
$340 million last year." Weapons sold by "the police" have 
seeped to third countries where disputes frequently take place 
to become lethal weapons there. 
  The WALL STREET JOURNAL denounced the United States 
regarding 
this for "actively exporting weapons while urging other 
countries to refrain from exporting weapons under the pretext of 
world security." 
  Last year, the United States assumed a hard-line attitude 
and 
imposed trade sanctions on China for exporting missiles to 
Pakistan. Even though China strongly denied the charge, world 
opinion supported the "defense of peace" position of the United 
States that strong measures be taken against suspected 
arms-selling countries. Although an excuse, the cause of world 
peace seemed plausible. However, according to the WALL STREET 
JOURNAL's report, the United States sold a total of 484 missiles 
in the five years from 1989 to 1992. This is almost eight times 
the 63 missiles China exported. 
  It is unreasonable for the United States to strongly slander 
China for arms sales which are so slight in comparison to its 
own sales, and it is unreasonable for it to do so under the 
pretext of peace while continuing its own sales. 
  It has been learned that arms dealers even manipulated 
disputes for their own interests. The world is anxiously 
watching the two faces --"police" and arms dealer--of the United 
States.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 KYODO -- North Korean heir apparent 
Kim Chong-il's half-brother, Kim Pyong-il, has been named 
ambassador to Finland and is awaiting agreement from the Finnish 
Government, a western diplomatic in Seoul said Thursday [3 
February]. 
  Kim Pyong-il, long considered a political rival of Kim 
Chong-il, was removed as envoy to Bulgaria in early December 
last year amid signs that his return may indicate that Kim 
Chong-il has resolved the leadership succession issue. He had 
been appointed to take up the post of North Korea's ambassador 
to Hungary in August 1988 but was reassigned to Bulgaria in 
December that year. 
  Meanwhile, the appointment of Kim Kwang-sop, husband of Kim 
Pyong-il's elder sister, Kim Kyong-chin, as North Korea's 
ambassador to Austria indicates that family members of Kim 
Pyong-il failed to occupy key posts in North Korea's power 
hierarchy. 
  Speculation was abuzz on whether Kim Chong-il's succession 
to 
power has come under challenge after Kim Pyong-il returned from 
an overseas mission and Kim Yong-chu, younger brother of North 
Korean President Kim Il-song, was named to the Politburo of the 
North Korean Workers' Party. 
  The appointment of Kim Pyong-il to an overseas diplomatic 
mission, however, showed that Kim Chong-il is still wary of his 
half-brother in securing his grip on power in the country, 
analysts said.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] North Korea has recently attracted attention by 
promoting a legal investment environment for foreign investment 
through laws such as the `land lease law.' (No. 40 decided by 
the standing committee of the Supreme People's Assembly) 
  North Korea seemed to use China as a model in making laws 
for 
international economic openness, for example, by adopting in 
1984 the `joint management law.' This is patterned after the 
Chinese `sino-foreign joint management law'. They also enacted 
a `land lease law' by copying the Chinese `temporary ordinance 
on the conveyance and reconveyance of the right to use 
government-owned land in cities.' (19 May 1990) 
  That North Korea highly praised this land lease law, 
announced through the government-owned Korean Central News 
Agency on 4 November as an `epochal' event, is seen as promoting 
foreign investment by advertising economic openness. This 
allows foreign businessmen to lease land even though North Korea 
(government) does not allow its people to do so and by 
advertising the alignment of statutes to support the law. This 
intention can be also seen in that this law was announced just 
before the second workshop on the industrial natural resource 
field for the Tumen River Area Development Project to be held in 
Seoul. (November 8-10) 
  This law prescribes the scope of application (Article 2), to 
corporations and individuals of `foreign countries' and also 
includes fellow Koreans who reside `outside the territory of the 
Republic' in a separate section. This prescription that may 
cause disputes on how to interpret the law in relation to South 
Korean corporations and businessmen, and it attracts attention 
on how North Korea would interpret the laws. 
<H5>  The Conveyance and Collateral of Land Utilization Right </H5>
  Land use rights obtained by lease contracts are prescribed 
as 
`property rights' and could be conveyed (by sale, sublease, 
gift, or inheritance) or could be collateral as long as the 
lease is effective. (Articles 15-27) The law appears to be 
decided from consideration for fast turnover and transactions of 
property rights, but the `sale' of use rights is an unfamiliar 
concept under a democratic legal system. In the sale of use 
rights, it seems to be difficult to convey them because the law 
recognizes the preferential purchasing rights (Article 19) of 
the `leasing institute, disallowing the lessee to transfer 
freely the utilization right, and makes the change of the 
business type impossible by requiring that the right be used 
under the same initial purpose. 
  In the meantime, two different opinions were proposed on the 
possibility of applying this law to South Korean corporations 
(and businessmen). 
  One suggests the fact that this law prescribed `fellow 
Koreans who reside outside the Republic territory' as within the 
scope of application means that North Korea intends to include 
South Korean corporations. This opinion is based on the fact 
that this law has a different scope of application from the 
`Joint Management Law' (1984). `The Joint Management Law' is 
limited to `fellow Koreans who reside outside the Korean 
peninsula' including businessmen in Japan, and clearly excludes 
South Korean industries. This interpretation is also based upon 
the theory that South Korean businessmen are included in `fellow 
Koreans who reside outside the Republic territory' by pointing 
out that North Korea recognized the range of its sovereignty to 
the north of the truce line in the seventh Japanese-North Korea 
amity meeting. (December 1991) 
  The other opinion stems from the fact that `the territory of 
the Republic' means the entire Korean peninsula because North 
Korea has insisted on the `One Korea' policy until now. 
Accordingly, South Korean industries (and businessmen) are 
excluded from the scope of `fellow Koreans who reside outside 
the territory.' 
  China had enacted `a regulation that promotes fellow 
Taiwanese investment (in China)' and had made clear that fellow 
Taiwanese can be partners in joint management. 
  Some North Korean officials, including Vice Premier Kim 
Tal-hyon, hoped several times that South Korean industries would 
invest in North Korea, and it was reported that Hwang Chong-nam 
(chief of the External Economic Cooperation Promotion 
Committee), who participated in the UNDP Industry workshop, said 
that he hoped South Korean industries would participate in the 
construction of industrial complexes and direct investment in 
the free economic and trade zone. It seems to be desperate 
countermeasure tactics that North Korea has prescribed `the 
fellow Koreans who reside out of the Republic territory' in the 
law to leave open the possibility that the law's applicability 
could be extended to South Korean economic corporations while it 
takes the `one Korea' policy in politics. In the Japanese-North 
Korea amity meeting, the representative from North Korea still 
kept the `one Korea' policy not only by suggesting the 
assumption of the `one Korea' theory, even though he recognized 
the territory of North Korea to the `north of the truce line,' 
but also by separating the South Korean government authority 
from businessmen. 
  North Korea needs to make a prompt decision to withdraw the 
`one Korea' policy as soon as possible in that the advance of 
South Korean businessmen to North Korea can not be accomplished 
smoothly in relation to the legal investment environment--such 
as the `land lease law'--if North Korea keeps this kind of dual 
stand.

  [Text] In a dispatch from Beijing, YONHAP reported on 3 
February that an anti-establishment underground student movement 
organization based on Kim Il-song University was carrying out 
activities in early 1992, but that it was uncovered by the North 
Korean authorities. Quoting its own source, YONHAP reported 
that the anti-establishment underground movement operated 
secretly from late 1991, mainly with students from the Kim 
Il-song University, but that the North Korean university 
students who took part in the underground organization were 
arrested by the authorities because moves by Chinese students 
studying in the North, who were part of the organization, were 
exposed by the Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang in early 1992.

  [Text] Japan's TOKYO SHIMBUN reports that a North Korean 
high-ranking naval officer was involved in the DPRK's purchase 
of submarines from Russia. Accordingly, there is doubt whether 
North Korea will really use them as scrap material. North Korea 
had said some time ago that it was importing used submarines 
from Russia to use as scrap metal. The paper reported today 
that the Russian submarines which will be exported to North 
Korea (?are anchored) at (?Novik) Bay in Vladivostok, and that a 
North Korean high-ranking naval officer was involved in 
negotiations between North Korea and Russia regarding submarine 
transactions. The paper also reported that because of the North 
Korean naval officer's participation in negotiations on 
submarine transactions, there are doubts whether North Korea 
will really use them as scrap metal as it stated.

<F P=106> [By Yi Sok-ku from Tokyo] </F>
  [Text] In a dispatch from Vladivostok on 3 February, 
Japan's TOKYO SHIMBUN reported that when submarines that were to 
be sold to North Korea became an issue in the international 
community, Russia decided to stop delivering them to North 
Korea. The paper, which carried exclusive news of Russia's plan 
to sell submarines to North Korea, sent a reporter to the 
(Novik) port in Vladivostok -- which is the prohibited area for 
foreigners -- and held an interview with a relevant official 
there. He said that Russia had decided to stop delivering 
submarines to North Korea. 
  Having obtained contract documents regarding transactions 
for 
the submarines that were to be sold to North Korea, the paper 
carried commentary on the documents on 3 February along with 
submarine photos. 
  The paper reported that although a relevant Russian military 
officer had said that they were "exporting scrap materials, not 
submarines," it was more likely that Russia was selling them as 
weapons as it has been confirmed that a North Korean 
high-ranking naval officer was directly involved in negotiations 
for the submarines. 
  The paper reported: Although Golf II Class submarines, which 
were to be sold to North Korea this time, appear to be largely 
scrap material, their facilities, including operational 
functions, remain functional. 
  According to the data furnished to the paper, the Management 
Bureau of the Resources External Affairs of the Russian Defense 
Ministry and the Japanese Toyen trade corporation (head office 
in Tokyo) signed the contract on 16-19 November last year. 
  The price of the 12 Russian submarines are as follows: Two 
of the submarines are $140,000 based on price of $51 per ton and 
ten submarines, at $92 per ton, amount to $1.15 million. One of 
these submarines has already been delivered to Najing port in 
North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- Russia does not accept 
some of North Korea's positions in connection with its nuclear 
development program, Russian Ambassador to South Korea Georgiy 
Kunadze said on Thursday. Kunadze, who arrived here last month 
to take up his new post, said in an exclusive interview with 
YONHAP news agency that North Korea is using its withdrawal from 
the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a bargaining chip 
in negotiations with other countries and international 
organizations, a practice which he said is not acceptable. 
  Meanwhile, Kunadze said he believes that President Kim 
Yong-sam will visit Moscow this year as the president expressed 
a strong desire to do so when the envoy presented his 
credentials to Kim Tuesday. 
  "This coming June has great significance for being the fifth 
anniversary of Kim's visit to Russia in his capacity as an 
opposition leader," the Russian official said, indicating that 
preparations were being pushed for Kim's second visit to take 
place in June. 
  Kunadze said North Korea wants to be given special status 
for 
nuclear inspections, but Russia believes that Pyongyang should 
observe the obligations of NPT. 
  Russia wants to maintain constructive and rational relations 
with North Korea in order to expand trade while revising a 
logging agreement with Pyongyang to their mutual benefit, he 
said. Russia believes that North Korea, as a member of the 
international community, should be subjected to neither special 
treatment nor discrimination, he added. 
  Touching on repayment of loans from South Korea to the 
former 
Soviet Union and Russia, Kunadze said his country has the 
capability to repay but, according to an agreement between 
Russia and the Paris Club -- a group of Western creditor 
countries -- non-members of the club are not entitled to better 
status than club members in receiving repayment. Therefore 
Seoul, which is not a member of the Paris Club, unfortunately 
may be in a worse position to obtain repayment from Russia. He 
thus proposed that Koreans take a broader view of relations with 
Russia, not just focusing on this particular problem. 
  Asked about the possibility of Russia compensating the 
families of victims of Korean Air 007, which was shot down by 
Soviet fighters over Sakhalin in 1983, Kunadze said his 
government had disclosed many details of the incident last year 
and would continue to investigate in the future. 
  Russia does not believe the problem has been resolved 
completely, and thinks that other countries will unveil related 
information, he said. 
  The Russian Government attaches great importance to the 
Asia- 
Pacific region in its foreign policy, the ambassador said. He 
added that Russia fully supports the recent proposal by South 
Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on holding a security 
dialogue in the region.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- Student exchanges with 
China are certain to become more active as soon as the South 
Korean Government liberalizes travel to China in late March, a 
Foreign Ministry official said on Thursday. The official 
predicted that overseas study in China will be activated and 
liberalized when China is excluded from "specific" countries in 
the government's "guideline on exchanges with northern (former 
and present communist) countries" in late March. 
  "China is now among the specific countries targeted by the 
guideline, so students who want to study in China are not able 
to gain favors like suspended military service," the official 
noted.

corruption and rigging. 
  Yi told Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok to pay 
special attention to price movements so that prices do not rise 
before Lunar New Year next week, while instructing Labor 
Minister Nam Chae-hui to see that workers' wages are not held in 
arrears during the holiday. He also stressed the need to ensure

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
stressed on Thursday Korean overseas missions should now be the 
center of market exploration and collection of trade and 
technical information. 
  At a Chongwadae [presidential residence] dinner he hosted 
for 
overseas mission chiefs and their spouses, Kim said the 
organization and function of overseas missions should change for 
the sake of new diplomacy. 
  "You should do actively anything that can be of help to 
strengthening the country's competitiveness," the president said. 
  Stating he is planning to have summit meetings with the 
leaders of major countries and would attend an APEC 
(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit meeting taking place 
in November in Indonesia, President Kim asked the senior 
diplomats to try to ensure national interests solidly in the 
course of preparing these and other events. 
  Korean mission chiefs posted in the American and Asian areas 
are now visiting the home country to attend an annual mission 
chiefs meeting.

  [Text] The results of the Uruguay Round talks which ended 
Dec. 15 last year are irreversible, said Ho Sung, chief of the 
Korean representative mission in Geneva. 
  "It will be impossible to rediscuss the promises (agreement) 
reached," the ambassador told reporters yesterday. 
  The opposition Democratic Party Tuesday [1 February] called 
on the government to renegotiate the agreement of the Uruguay 
Round talks which will result in the opening of the Korean rice 
market, in the wake of a massive demonstration by some 20,000 
farmers and students in downtown Seoul. 
  Farmers and students took to streets after a rally Tuesday 
denouncing the opening of the domestic rice market. Some 100 
demonstrators and riot policemen were reported injured and six 
police buses were burnt during violent demonstrations which 
paralyzed downtown traffic till late Tuesday night. 
  Member nations will verify whether each country implements 
the agreement as promised by March 27 and a ministerial 
conference will be held April 13-15 in Morocco to sign the final 
draft, Ho said. 
  Ho is here to attend the annual meeting of ambassadors 
serving in Asia and America, which opened yesterday and will 
continue through next Monday. 
  Peter Sutherland, secretary-general of the GATT, earlier 
expressed the hope that no new issues would be raised at the 
ministerial talks, referring to Japan and the United States, Ho 
said. 
  At the ministerial meeting, an interim committee will be 
formed to inaugurate the World Trade Organization (WTO), which 
will be in charge of the execution of the Uruguay Round 
agreements, the ambassador said. He predicted that Sutherland 
will assume the chairmanship of the interim committee. Ho 
forecast that the WTO will be inaugurated in January or July, 
1995. Japan wants July while the United States hopes for 
January, Ho said. He forecast that Korea will benefit from free 
trade although there will be difficulties in some area, 
including agriculture and services. 
  World trade will grow 12 percent annually or $745.5 billion 
over the next 10 years till the year 2005 and income will grow 
by $230 billion as a result of the Uruguay Round agreement, Ho 
said quoting reports of the GATT secretariat. 
  Korea contributed 1,990,000 Swiss francs to the GATT 
secretariat, placing it 11th in terms of donations. The 
contribution accounted for 2.27 percent of the total GATT 
secretariat budget, Ho said adding that Korea is to donate 2.1 
million Swiss francs (some $1.5 million) this year. 
  Korea should send to the WTO the number of experts 
commensurate with its contribution to the world body, he said, 
adding that there are few qualified experts hoping for the job.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- The government will ease 
restrictions on corporate fund-raising overseas by increasing 
the ceiling on foreign exchange-denominated securities issues 
abroad from last year's 2 billion U.S. dollars to 2.5 billion 
dollars and relaxing the qualifications required of corporations 
to issue such foreign debts. 
  Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong, attending a meeting of 
business leaders sponsored by the Korea Employers' Federation on 
Wednesday, said the government would also selectively allow the 
introduction of foreign commercial loans to finance imports of 
capital goods for infrastructure expansion projects. 
  To help corporate investment in foreign countries, 
restrictions on overseas real estate investment will be eased, 
while the red tape surrounding government approval of corporate 
foreign investment plans will be removed. In addition, overseas 
securities investment by institutional investors, such as 
securities houses and insurance companies, will be liberalized, 
Hong said. 
  To improve the country's foreign investment environment, he 
added, the five-year industry-by-industry plan on market opening 
for foreign investors, set to start in 1996, will be revised to 
advance the opening date and broaden the opening scope. 
  The increased investment in foreign industries and 
securities 
markets will check inflation due to an anticipated increase in 
foreign fund inflows in the coming year, he observed. 
  Foreign investors are expected to increase their 
participation in the stock market here this year, combining with 
a current-account surplus expected for the year to expand 
foreign fund flows to the country. 
  Corporations giving employees part of their profits in the 
form of a special bonus in shares, not in cash, will be accorded 
tax benefits in a bid to promote labor peace in such 
corporations, Hong said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- The Finance Ministry on 
Thursday announced a two-stage plan to ease foreign exchange 
controls during the first half of the year. In the first stage 
starting in late January, the ceiling on an individual's foreign 
exchange holdings overseas will be raised from the current 2,000 
U.S. dollars to 20,000 dollars. 
  Corporations' qualifications for holding and using foreign 
exchange overseas will be relaxed by reducing the minimum 
requirement for an annual two-way trade achievement from 100 
million dollars to 10 million dollars to increase the number of 
qualified firms from the current 136 to 1,304. The ceiling on 
these firms' foreign exchange holdings abroad will also be 
raised from 10 percent of the trade achievement or 100 million 
dollars to 30 percent or 300 million dollars, whichever is 
larger. But to prevent inflows of hot money, individuals 
receiving an unrequited remittance of more than 20,000 dollars 
from abroad will face restrictions when they convert it into 
won. These restrictions are not yet known. 
  Those with an unrequited receipt of more than 50,000 dollars 
in foreign exchange a year will be referred to tax collectors 
for possible taxation. 
  Conversion of foreign exchange into won by non-residents 
(foreigners) will be limited to 20,000 dollars a month when the 
conversion has nothing to do with authorized payment in won for 
their business in the country. 
  The scope of foreign securities investment will be expanded: 
Securities houses, investment trust companies and insurance 
firms will be free to invest as much as they want in foreign 
securities markets, as banks now are, while pension funds and 
other investment funds and short-term finance firms will be 
allowed to invest as much as 100 million dollars, instead of the 
current limit of 50 million dollars, in overseas securities 
markets. 
  In the second quarter, individual investors will be allowed 
to invest in foreign securities. 
  As insurance firms now do, banks, securities houses, 
investment trust firms, short-term finance houses, pension funds 
and general trading companies will be permitted to invest in 
real estate abroad, while foreign direct investment will be 
liberalized except in industries where restrictions on Korean 
investment are deemed necessary. 
  Under the second stage to be implemented during the second 
quarter, the number of current transactions of goods and 
services requiring a bank's approval for settlement of accounts 
in foreign exchange will be reduced from 109 to 39 to 49. Those 
still requiring a bank's approval are transactions considered to 
be of an anti-social nature, such as payment for capital flight 
or that related to gambling and drugs. 
  The classification of foreign exchange banks into A and B 
classes will be scrapped.

  [Text] A combination of rising production costs, high 
interest rates and various business restrictions has hindered 
the influx of foreign investment into Korea over the past few 
years, according to a report released by a state-financed 
institute yesterday. 
  The Korea Institute for International Economic Policy said 
in 
its report that foreign investment in Korea which had shown a 
rapid pickup early in the 1980s went into the doldrums from 1989. 
  The report attributed dwindling foreign investment in Korea 
to the overall deterioration of foreign investment conditions. 
"Soaring labor costs, a continuation of high interest rates and 
spiralling inflation combined to aggravate Korea's investment 
climate," it said. 
  In addition, the existence of various administrative red 
tape 
and inadequate protection of intellectual property rights also 
tarnished Korea's attractiveness to foreign investors, it 
claimed. 
  According to the report, the rate of capital formation 
contributed by foreign investment during 1986-1991 stood at a 
meager 1.1 percent. The rate compares with Taiwan's 3.5 
percent, Singapore's 29.4 percent, Hong Kong's 12.1 percent and 
China's 2.3 percent. 
  Moreover, the latest trend in foreign investment in Korea 
has 
shown a sustained fall, casting a pall over the country's bid to 
join the ranks of advanced industrial countries by attracting 
more foreign capital, the report said. 
  Foreign investment in Korea soared from the early 1980s as 
Seoul adopted a massive liberalization policy. Foreign 
investment reached its zenith in the late 1980s with annual 
investment amounting to 1.28 billion dollars in 1988. 
  But foreign investment began to slide from 1989 as Korea's 
investment conditions rapidly deteriorated, dropping to 894 
million dollars in 1992. 
  According to the report, foreign-invested manufacturing 
companies in Korea numbered 1,570 as of March last year with 
their total investment amounting to about 5.56 billion dollars. 
  By industry, electrics and electronics topped the list of 
foreign-invested manufacturing companies with 344 in operation, 
followed by machinery (331) and chemical engineering (241). 
These three industries account for nearly 58 percent of the 
total number of foreign-invested manufacturing companies in 
Korea.

  But in terms of invested amounts, chemical engineering was 
placed tops with 1.4 billion dollars, followed by electrics and 
electronics (1.1 billion dollars) and petroleum (610 million 
dollars). 
  Of the 1,570 foreign-invested manufacturing companies, only 
13.6 percent or 214 companies are 100 percent foreign-owned with 
most of them being joint ventures with Korean companies, 
according to the report. 
  Japanese investors account for about 61 percent of the total 
foreign-invested manufacturing companies with investors from the 
United States making up 21 percent. The remainder are those 
from European or other countries. 
  To lure more foreign capital, the report proposed an 
across-the- board improvement in Korea's business conditions. 
  "Korea is still regarded as one of the promising countries 
for foreign investment because of its high growth potential and 
sustained economic development," it said. 
  If Korea exerts every effort to revamp its business 
conditions, foreign investment will make a strong rebound in the 
future, the report said.

  [Text] Entry restrictions in the private-service sector 
which includes beauty parlors, barber shops, public bath houses 
and various private institutions will be alleviated 
significantly to help create an atmosphere conducive to freer 
competition. Import bans, effective under the import 
diversification system, will also be lifted on some consumer 
products such as plastic household utensils. Imports of some 
farm products, which have recently shown steep price spirals, 
will be made as soon as possible to place curbs on soaring 
prices. 
  These are the highlights of a package of anti-inflation 
steps 
announced by the Economic Planning Board [EPB] yesterday. 
  Deputy Premier-Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok 
chaired a meeting of economic ministers to discuss these and 
other anti-inflation measures. The measures are in response to 
mounting public criticism about soaring inflation. 
  The National Statistical Office [NSO] on Tuesday announced 
that consumer prices surged a whopping 1.3 percent in January, 
boosted by the rise in public-service charges and sharp 
increases in prices of some farm products. 
  Economists warn of inflationary pressure building up more 
strongly, citing some factors which would hurt the nation's 
price stability. To create long-term stability in 
private-service charges, the anti-inflation steps call for 
easing entry restrictions in the private-service sector across 
the board. Specifically, the license system now used for new 
beauty parlors, barber shops, public bath houses and lodging 
places will be changed to a registration or report system to 
encourage competition. 
  Criteria governing the opening of various private 
institutions will also be eased to facilitate the opening of 
these institutions. "The easing of restrictions will help spark 
freer competition, thus contributing to reign in rises in 
private-service charges," an EPB official said. 
  To stabilize prices of manufactured goods, the package 
envisages phasing out import restrictions on some consumer 
goods, particularly those imported from Japan, such as household 
utensils made of glass and plastics. 
  The EPB also urged manufacturers not to raise prices of 
their 
goods by absorbing price-raising factors through technological 
development while threatening to slap sanctions against those 
who try to raise prices through collusion. 
  The government also plans to release state-held rice without 
limit to curb rising rice prices. In January alone, rice prices 
soared a whopping 3.1 percent, according to the NSO. Onions, 
garlic, salt and powdered milk will be imported massively. 
Imports of onions and garlic are planned at 3,000 tons, 
respectively, this month and for the whole of this year, about 
78,000 tons of salt will be imported. 
  The EPB said the government will exert utmost effort to 
stabilize price increases of 30 basic necessities which affect 
public livelihood significantly at below 4 percent in 1994. 
They are rice, beef, pork, eggs, garlic, onions, sugar, ramyon 
[instant noodles], wheat flour, salt, footwear, TVs, 
refrigerators, toys, yontan [coal brickets], propane and so on. 
  The government will also focus on minimizing rises in 
public-service charges by urging public utilities to refrain 
from high increases through management renovation. 
  The EPB sees curbing this year's inflation rate, as measured 
by consumer prices, at below 6 percent. Last year, the consumer 
price index soared 5.8 percent.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- Korea's major electronics 
manufacturers are brimming with confidence as exports to Japan 
continue to grow, industry sources said Thursday. Samsung 
Electronics, Goldstar and Daewoo Electronics saw exports of 
electric home appliances and semiconductors to Japan soar an 
average 150 percent last year over the year before. Exports 
rose a further 50 percent last month, compared with 12-percent 
growth in January 1993. The industry attributes the brisk 
exports to a strong yen that has weakened the price 
competitiveness of Japanese manufacturers. 
  Samsung exported 350 million U.S. dollars worth of 
electronics to Japan, up 110 percent from 1992. Its exports of 
semiconductors were up 100 percent to 240 million dollars from 
1992's 120 million dollars; Television sets, up 142 percent to 
80 million dollars; and refrigerators, up 192 percent to 12 
million dollars. Samsung said January exports grew 50 percent, 
compared with 12 percent a year earlier. 
  Goldstar shipped 33 million dollars worth of television 
sets, 
up 65 percent from 20 million dollars in 1992, and 1 million 
dollars of microwave ovens, up 100 percent from 500,000 dollars 
a year earlier. Its January exports increased 33 percent to 16 
million dollars, three times the 11 percent growth registered 
the year before. 
  Daewoo saw exports skyrocket 116 percent to 218 million 
dollars last year with shipments of microwave ovens rising 56 
percent, refrigerators 45 percent and video cassette recorders 
29 percent in January.

this year. The Maritime and Port Administration reported on 
Thursday it had decided to permit shipping firms to build these 
vessels with foreign financial funds obtained in the name of 
their locally incorporated companies. 
  The decision is to help the maritime industry secure vessels 
more easily and alleviate their taxational burdens, an official 
at the administration said. He explained that Korean shipping 
firms will be allowed to obtain shipbuilding loans abroad 
without regard to whether the vessels to be built would be 
registered in Korea or elsewhere. This means that ships thus 
obtained could be registered in third countries, instead of 
Korea, where ship-related tax rates are lower. 
  In the initial stage, shipping lines will be permitted to 
obtain only large specialized vessels like crude oil, coal and 
iron ore carriers and container vessels because an overall 
permission would obviously lead to a rush to overseas vessel 
procurement, the official said. 
  Presently shipping lines obtain vessels with either 
shipbuilding loans from domestic banks or foreign capital 
introduced under the condition of registering new-built vessels 
in the country. But, domestic loans carry high interest rates 
while introduction of foreign capital has to go through rigid 
government control.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor suggested Thursday [3 February] trade sanctions 
may be unavoidable if a compromise cannot be reached with Japan 
over establishing numerical targets in bilateral trade relations. 
  Kantor asked leaders of the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) for their understanding in the trade framework 
negotiations, saying that without numerical targets in the 
automotive, insurance and other fields, the U.S. choices of 
action would be limited. 
  Kantor met LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori and Ryutaro 
Hashimoto, a former finance minister and now chairman of the 
LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council. 
  Mori, in response, explained Japan's efforts to open its 
markets but added the idea of numerical targets would have a 
negative effect on international free trade. 
  The LDP leaders expressed support for the government's 
direction in the trade negotiations.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa agreed 
Thursday [3 February] that the United States and Japan must 
continue to try to achieve progress in bilateral trade talks, 
the top government spokesman said. 
  The two were meeting at the premier's official residence, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference. 
  "They agreed that it is important for both sides to make 
further efforts" ahead to the meeting between U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and Hosokawa in Washington on February 11, Takemura 
said. 
  Hosokawa will confer with Clinton to assess progress in the 
economic talks being held under a bilateral accord concluded 
last July. 
  Kantor expressed hope the Clinton-Hosokawa meeting will help 
the bilateral trade negotiations bear fruit, Takemura said. 
  The U.S. administration hopes to successfully conclude the 
framework talks prior to the summit of the two leaders, who met 
twice last year. 
  Negotiations on automobile and auto parts trade, government 
procurement and foreign access to the Japanese insurance market 
have been stalemated over a U.S. proposal on setting "objective 
criteria" to gauge the openness of Japanese markets. 
  Tokyo has refused to accept the proposal, saying such 
measures would amount to setting aside a specific market share 
for foreign goods and services, tantamount to managed trade. 
  Kantor, who came to Tokyo on Tuesday as Clinton's special 
envoy, did not directly voice dissatisfaction with Tokyo's 
stance. 
  On the government's announcement of a 5.3 trillion yen 
income 
tax cut, Kantor said it was an appropriate decision but did not 
elaborate, Takemura said. 
  Kantor congratulated Hosokawa on his success in getting onto 
the statute books a set of political reform bills aimed at 
rooting out corruption in Japanese public life, according to the 
chief cabinet secretary. 
  Hosokawa narrowly pushed through his reforms, on which he 
had 
staked his political fortunes, by his stated deadline of 
Saturday, the closing date of the last extraordinary Diet 
session. 
  On his arrival at the premier's official residence, Kantor 
told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that he welcomes Tokyo's decision to 
slash income tax by 5.3 trillion yen. 
  "It is a useful step in the right direction," he said. 
  After emerging from his 40-minute meeting with Hosokawa, the 
U.S. trade representative said it was "a very good meeting." 
  W. Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic 
policy, and Takemura were also present at the Kantor-Hosokawa 
talks. 
  Asked if Clinton would move to revive the "Super 301" trade 
measure through an executive order, Kantor said only, "We'll 
save that conversation for later." 
  Kantor said last month the Clinton administration may renew 
the punitive measure through an executive order in connection 
with the deadlocked trade talks between Japan and the United 
States. 
  The super 301, in effect from 1988 to 1990, required the 
U.S. 
Government to conduct an annual review of trade barriers abroad 
and impose trade sanctions if those barriers were not removed 
within a year. 
  On Wednesday, Kantor met with International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata. He also conferred with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
earlier Thursday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will hold subcabinet-level meetings in Washington next week to 
seek a breakthrough in the deadlocked bilateral trade talks, 
government sources said Wednesday [2 February]. 
  The two countries decided against holding the high-level 
talks this weekend in Tokyo as originally planned because the 
prospect of an early breakthrough is dim, the sources said. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor met Japanese Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata and International Trade and Industry 
Minister Hiroshi Kumagai on Wednesday, but the two sides failed 
to narrow the gap over the U.S. demand that numerial targets be 
set to measure progress in opening Japanese markets to foreign 
products. 
  Japanese and U.S. officials are supposed to draw up a 
progress report on the framework trade talks before Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet 
February 11.

<F P=106> ["News Focus" by Keiji Urakami: "Private Role Sought in </F>
Breaking Auto deadlock"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Japan's trade ministry is 
turning to the private sector to play an increasing role in 
breaking an impasse in auto trade talks with the United States. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has 
implicitly requested major automakers to formulate their own 
plans for voluntary purchases of U.S.-made auto parts, MITI 
sources said. 
  The step, termed by some an administrative guidance, is in 
response to growing U.S. pressure for Tokyo to establish a 
specific program for increasing American access to Japan's auto 
and auto parts markets, ahead of the February 11 meeting between 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. 
  MITI, unwilling to cave in to a U.S. call for Tokyo to use 
numerical targets as a means of gauging its penetration of 
Japanese markets, is trying to get the private sector to soften 
Washington's stance, the sources said. 
  But the U.S. policy runs the risk of leading to managed 
trade, a concept the Japanese Government has strongly rejected 
under the framework talks. 
  This would run counter to the Hosokawa administration's 
chief 
goal of easing government controls on rules and regulations. 
  Earlier this week, top executives of Japan's three major 
carmakers -- Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and Honda 
Motor Co. -- were separately called to meet MITI Minister 
Hiroshi Kumagai, the sources said. 
  Details of the meetings were not disclosed but they must 
have 
discussed the carmakers' foreign parts purchase plans, the 
sources said. 
  Asking the auto industry for cooperation may be one idea 
Hosokawa can take to his meeting with Clinton in Washington, the 
sources said. But cooperation must not go beyond that made on a 
voluntary basis, the sources added. 
  The latest request to the auto industry came after a 
proposal 
by a senior MITI official for a more cooperative approach by the 
private sector, which is designed to increase Japanese purchases 
of U.S. automobiles and auto parts. 
  "The cooperation approach" being recommended by MITI is 
aimed 
at dispelling "mutual distrust" between Washington and Tokyo in 
the framework talks, Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for 
international affairs, said in a recent press conference. 
  The new cooperation scheme consists of three phases -- 
setting of objective criteria by each automaker in U.S.-made 
parts buying and other areas, evaluation of buying records in 
accordance with the criteria on a semiannual basis and deciding 
whether or not to devise extra steps based on the assessment. 
  Criteria for Japanese automakers may also cover the number 
of 
their dealership chains handling U.S. autos, dealers' records 
of U.S. car imports and whether the "design-in" cooperative 
approach between users and makers from the initial stage of 
development to manufacturing is being adopted by makers. 
  The cooperation approach is also applied to U.S. automakers 
by measuring their business efforts based on such criteria as 
whether products are tailored to meet the needs of Japanese 
motorists by, for instance, having right-hand steering wheels, 
Okamatsu said. 
  Okamatsu said the approach is not like administrative 
guidance, which he said is inconsistent with Hosokawa's 
deregulation policy.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Russia's frontier forces may 
open fire on Japanese ships if they violate Russian territorial 
waters, the commander-in-chief of the forces said Thursday [3 
February]. The commander, Andrey Nikolayev, told reporters in 
Tokyo that about 130 Japanese fishing boats entered waters near 
the four Russian-held islands claimed by Japan on January 21 and 
22 in defiance of Russian border patrols, he said. 
  Nikolayev criticized these violations as damaging bilateral 
relations, and said if such violations continue to occur Russian 
forces will act on the basis of a Russian law which allows them 
to use arms against border violators, he said. 
  A high-ranking official of the frontier forces has said the 
alleged violations were a premeditated provocation with a 
political purpose. 
  Nikolayev, however, denied the political angle, saying the 
boats had entered Russian waters apparently for economic reasons. 
  The former Soviet Union occupied the four islands off 
Japan's 
northernmost main island of Hokkaido at the end of World War II, 
and Japan has constantly urged their return. 
  Nikolayev said Russian border guards video-taped the 
incidents and he is ready to give the tape to the Japanese 
Government through diplomatic channels. Tokyo is investigating 
the alleged violations in response to Moscow's protest.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Hosokawa on tax reform at a </F>
press conference from the prime minister's official residence in 
Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] I feel sorry that you are invited to this news 
conference at such a late hour of the night. 
  With regard to the tax reform, the ruling parities have 
today 
entrusted me with the task of working out measures to handle 
this issue. In this connection, I have prepared a program for 
an overall reform of the taxation system as stated in the press 
release that has been distributed among you, and I would like to 
submit this program to the Diet. 
  Now, let me explain the major points of this program: First 
of all, the reduction of such taxes as the income tax and 
resident tax will amount to a total of 5.5 trillion yen, and 
this tax cut plan will be put into effect on 1 January 1994. 
Second, we will create a national welfare tax, though in only a 
small amount, and abolish the consumption tax. And this plan 
will be put into effect on 1 April 1997. The taxation rate will 
be set at seven percent. 
  At the meetings of representatives of the council on 
economic 
issues and of leaders of both the government and ruling 
coalition that were concluded just now, I obtained their 
understanding that I am going to submit this program to the Diet 
as a government proposal. As a result of the implementing this 
program, revenue for the national finances will be reduced by 18 
trillion yen in three years, In other words, the increase of 
income for the household economy in the amount of 18 trillion 
yen in three years will have the effect of an upturn in business. 
  At present, Japan is becoming an aging society at a pace 
which is several times faster than in the United States or in 
European countries. And it is our responsibility to build our 
society into an affluent one that will never lose its vitality, 
even when becoming an aging society. On New Year's Day, I 
announced a vision for greeting the 21st century, and I would 
like to build an affluent society with vitality by promoting 
this vision. And in the course of promoting this vision, I will 
take measures to ensure social security and improve our living 
environment and social infrastructure. And it goes without 
saying that it will take an enormous amount of expenditure to 
carry out such a vlsion. 
  In studying the existing taxation system -- in other words, 
the framework as to how our people share the burden of taxes -- 
it is noted that too much emphasis has been imposed on income 
taxation, and too much of a burden has been imposed on those who 
are in the prime of life. This fact has been pointed out 
frequently, and if such a situation were left as it is, more and 
more of a burden would be imposed on those who are in the prime 
of life, and as a result, they are bound to lose vitality. And 
I have been repeating that this [current] system will certainly 
result in such a situation. To support the aging society, we 
must somehow reduce the burden imposed on those who are in the 
prime of life. In other words, I feel that we will have to 
reduce taxation on incomes but raise the rate of taxation on 
consumption so as to work out a framework based on all the 
people sharing the cost of supporting the aging population. 
Since we will be asked to take responsibility for the future, I 
believe that when viewed from the standpoints that I have just 
stated, we should never leave the existing taxation system as it 
is now. 
  And since I delivered my policy speech to the Diet, I have 
persistently stated at the Diet sessions held so far that it Is 
necessary to promote an overall tax reform based on the Tax 
Commission's recommendations so that a system of well-balanced 
taxation an incomes, assets, and consumption can be worked out. 
  With regard to the issuance of deficit-covering bonds, for 
which no sources of repayment can be secured, I have repeatedly 
stated that it must be handled with the greatest caution. I 
have made such remarks repeatedly because I feel that our future 
generations, who will support the aging society, should not be 
asked to pay for this burden. At the same time, it goes without 
saying that the top priority task for the cabinet is to 
eliminate an idea that future prospects for the economy still 
remain opaque, and also to ensure that economy will recover in 
fiscal 1994. 
  Based on these views, I have just obtained an understanding 
at the meeting of representatives of the council on economic 
issues and of leaders of the government and ruling coalition 
that the government will submit the program, a copy of which has 
been distributed among you, to the Diet as an official program. 
And I would also like to seek the understanding of all our 
people. 
  This Is the report I wanted to make to you.

<F P=106> [Question-and-answer session with Prime Minister Morihiro </F>
Hosokawa by unidentified reporters at the press room of the 
prime minister's office in Tokyo on 2 February -- live] 
  [Text] [Unidentified dean of the press corps] Reporters 
from various organizations can now ask questions freely. 
  [Unidentified reporter] You said the [pump-priming] plan has 
been approved. Did the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
also indicate its approval? 
  [Hosokawa] The SDPJ -- please ask the SDPJ directly for a 
more accurate account of its views -- said that it is impossible 
for the party to agree to the proposed tax reform that links a 
tax cut with a tax hike, with the date of implementation clearly 
stated. It said that while it could agree with certain points 
in creating a national welfare tax, this new tax has certain 
aspects that are identical to those of the consumption tax. It 
wanted the tax cut to be implemented through issuing short-term 
special government bonds, and it asked that a consultative body 
to discuss compensatory revenue sources be set up in order to 
build a consensus. All parties made very tough statements, but 
in the end, they agreed that because the plan was based on the 
judgment of the responsible official of the administration, they 
could not stop the government from proposing the plan, and they 
agreed that they would not stop the government from doing so. 
This was the general reaction of the parties. 
  [Reporter] When did you start to think about this national 
welfare tax? That is my first question. The second question 
is: From my reading of this [prime minister's press release], I 
cannot see how this tax is different from the consumption tax. 
I think there will be criticisms from the people that only the 
name has changed. In your opinion, what is the difference 
between the consumption tax and this national welfare tax? 
  [Hosokawa] With regard to the national welfare tax, please 
see item 1, the big 1, the 1 in brackets in this handout. It 
tells about the nature of the national welfare tax and says that 
the tax will be used as a source of revenue to build a vigorous 
and prosperous society even in the era of the aging society. 
That is indeed the purpose of the tax. While we do not have a 
clear definition of a special-purpose tax, the purpose of the 
national welfare tax is completely different from that of the 
current consumption tax. In a broad sense, we can say that it 
is a special-purpose tax. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, when the consumption tax was 
introduced, there was much talk about using it for welfare 
purposes. [Former] Prime Minister Uno clearly said during the 
upper house elections that the consumption tax will all be used 
for welfare purposes. At that time, Prime Minister Uno did not 
clarify what he meant. I think Prime Minister Uno did not mean 
that this will be used as a special-purpose tax; he meant that 
because welfare expenses were expanding every year, the creation 
of the consumption tax would mean that much additional revenue 
would be available for welfare. Is not the new tax just the 
same? 
  [Hosokawa] This time, the purpose has been stated more 
clearly. As I just said, the purpose is evidently different from 
that of the existing consumption tax. This should be clear even 
from what is written in the statement distributed to you. There 
was a lot of discussion about whether we could make the new tax 
more clearly a special-purpose tax. However, the building of a 
welfare society is not a simple matter -- for instance, building 
ramps on the edges of sidewalks, or constructing housing units 
for the aged.... Some may suggest that the use of revenue from 
the tax be even more limited -- for instance, be limited to 
pensions or to basic pensions. However, welfare can be viewed 
from various standpoints. Therefore, I believe that the 
national welfare tax will be more in line with the welfare 
purpose if we think of it as a special-purpose tax in a broad 
sense. 
  [Reporter] May I, Mr. Prime Minister? What is the basis for 
setting the national welfare tax rate at 7 percent come 1 April 
1997, or three years from now? 
  [Hosokawa] We have presented a vision for the 21st century. 
We are considering the sources of revenue and other factors. A 
pension reform will also begin -- we have to deal with it -- and 
we need to meet the various needs of the aging society. Under 
such circumstances, and judging from various viewpoints, we 
decided that a 7-percent tax rate would be appropriate. The 
finance minister will give you the details about this. He will 
speak about this here later. 
  [Reporter] You have to make it clear here why it is going to 
be 7 percent three years from now. You have to clarify under 
your vision for welfare how much revenue would be required for 
the aging society, and therefore, how much of a tax burden will 
have to be imposed. Without clear-cut figures, there will be no 
clear numerical basis. Please be very clear about this. 
  [Hosokawa] We have not computed the accurate data for the 
vision for welfare, and this is only a rough estimate. The 
vision for welfare will only be completed by March. While this 
is a rough estimate, we have a general idea of the minimum 
required revenue. Therefore, we came up with the 7-percent 
figure. 
  [Reporter] If you are saying that this is a rough 
estimate, is there a possibility that the figure might change by 
1 April 1997? 
  [Hosokawa] When? 
  [Reporter] I mean, if this is a rough estimate at this 
point, 
is it sufficiently possible that the figure might change by 1 
April 1997? 
  [Hosokawa] No, the percentage will remain unchanged. It will 
not change. Although I used the term rough estimate, we have 
made a general calculation. Maybe the expression rough estimate 
was not appropriate. On the whole, we have come up with 
definite figures. 
  [Reporter] But Mr. Prime Minister, raising the existing 
3-percent consumption tax to the 7-percent national welfare tax 
would mean an increase of 4 percent. Based on current revenue 
from the consumption tax, I think there will be a revenue 
increase of about 9 trillion yen. However, taking into 
consideration the planned 6 trillion yen in tax cuts and the 
amount required for the redemption of government bonds, I think 
that there will be a tax hike of 1 trillion to 2 trillion yen in 
April 1997. The idea of balancing income, consumption, and 
assets you mentioned a while ago is, I think, based on the 
so-called principle of balancing a tax cut and a tax increase. 
Could you spell out why the idea has led to a virtual tax 
increase? 
  [Hosokawa] It is true that as you mentioned, there will be a 
tax hike after 1997. However, because the purpose is to 
establish a tax system which does not put a heavy burden on 
working generations and which is capable of steadily supporting 
Japan's aging society, you should not evaluate the tax hike 
simply from the point of the tax burden. 
  [Reporter] I would like to confirm what you have said. I 
think what you have said is that the government will incorporate 
the national welfare tax revenue into the general accounts 
budget. Are you going to devise a way to allow the government 
to use the revenue from the new tax for welfare purpose? For 
example, a law stipulates what the oil tax should be used for. 
Will you formulate a way to make it possible for the government 
to use the revenue preferentially for welfare? 
  [Hosokawa] As I have said, the national welfare tax will be 
used preferentially for welfare purposes. My statement here 
says that the government will legislate the new tax for this 
purpose. As I said earlier, the revenue will be used not only 
to pay old-age pensions but also to meet various other demands. 
  [Reporter] So the tax revenue will not be used specifically 
for pensions. 
  [Hosokawa] That is right. 
  [Reporter] I understand the idea you demonstrated in your 
statement, but it seems that the revenue from the national 
welfare tax can be used for any purpose. I think that people 
would have the impression that the government changed the name 
of the consumption tax to the welfare tax only to reduce 
opposition to the consumption tax. Could you explain the 
differences between the two taxes? 
  [Hosokawa] My statement here clearly indicates that the 
government will legislate the new tax whose revenue will be used 
to realize a vigorous society. I believe that the public will 
understand the purpose of the new tax if they read this 
statement. I greatly hope that the people will understand its 
purpose. 
  [Reporter] Do you mean to say that despite the fact that 
it will not be enacted into a law, a commitment will be made 
that the administration in power at the time will use this tax 
revenue for this purpose? 
  [Hosokawa] Well, it will be turned into a legal system. 
  [Reporter] But the purpose for which the revenue will be 
used 
will not be specified. Is that right? 
  [Hosokawa] That is correct. No purpose for its use will be 
specified. Yes, that is correct. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, may I ask a question now? 
  [Hosokawa] Yes. 
  [Reporter] Well, it is desirable to make a proposal for such 
a reform program. Of course, it goes without saying that this 
program cannot be enacted until the Diet approves it. 
  Well, then, seeing that someone has brought up the same 
issue 
just now, we understand that the SDPJ is opposed to the program. 
Therefore, I would like to ask you your opinion on whether the 
program will be passed by the Diet by winning over the SPDJ in 
your dealings with the Diet sessions from now on. For instance, 
if the SPDJ should insist on continuing its opposition, what 
will happen to the current coalition cabinet? Do you plan to 
seek the cooperation of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in 
settling this issue? What are your views on these basic 
questions? 
  [Hosokawa] To say nothing of the SPDJ's opposition, there 
are 
also many people within my own party -- the Japan New Party -- 
who are strongly calling for this issue to be handled with great 
caution. Also, discussions were held today on this issue within 
all the parties. After very active deliberations within their 
own parties, party representatives have finally decided what 
action to take. 
  Incidentally, the case of the SPDJ was mentioned just now. 
However, from the government's point of view, and in order to 
have this bill passed, we will do our utmost -- because we have 
been allowed to make such a decision at the 11th hour -- to 
obtain the understanding of all the parties concerned, let alone 
that of the SPDJ. 
  [Reporter] Concerning this issue, I would like to ask you 
whether changes might be made to the general program that was 
announced today, while efforts are being made to promote 
intraparty cooperation, and also whether, Mr. Prime Minister, 
you gave a briefing on this program to LDP President Kono during 
your talks with him yesterday. 
  [Hosokawa] No, I did not talk about this program yesterday 
because it was only today that this program was brought up for 
deliberation at the meetings of representatives, of the Council 
on Economic Affairs, and of the government and ruling parties. 
Thus, because there was a lapse in time, I did not mention this 
program. 
  [Reporter] No sufficient deliberations have been carried out 
on this program within the ruling parties. And, Mr. Prime 
Minister, you have put this program before the people all of a 
sudden. Therefore, the people must have become, shall I say, 
greatly confused. If this program should be converted into a 
government proposal without sufficient deliberation being 
carried out, I am afraid that our people may gain the impression 
that the proposal was formulated very impetuously. What do you 
think of this? 
  [Hosokawa] You have just mentioned deliberations within 
parties. Please be informed that each party was asked to set up 
a council on economic affairs last December. At the same time, 
various issues have been discussed at the meeting of 
representatives [of the coalition parties]. And if 
deliberations should be carried out at these forums, there 
certainly will be numerous issues that will have to be 
discussed. It is my belief that as far as the coalition parties 
are concerned, appropriate procedures have already been followed. 
  [Reporter] It seems to me that no discussions have ever been 
carried out on the proposal concerning the national welfare tax. 
What do you say to this? 
  [Hosokawa] On the basis of the national welfare tax.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] And it seems to me that no proposal 
for taxation in the form of the national welfare tax has been 
presented to the ruling parties for discussion so far. 
  [Hosokawa] Well, shall I say that this proposal surfaced as 
we reached the final stage of consultations? Also, 
deliberations have been carried out on this argument from 
various points of view. As I have mentioned just now, the basic 
precondition for carrying out these deliberations lies in the 
vision on welfare issues that I had disclosed on New Year's Day. 
Thus, because we have asked for deliberations based on such a 
vision, I do not think that our proposal has been made 
impetuously. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you promised that there 
would be multifaceted discussions at the Council on Economic 
Affairs. However, discussions had virtually ceased while the 
political reform bills were being deliberated in the upper 
house. Moreover, according to the briefing we received, a 
considerable portion of the council's deliberations were devoted 
to hearing briefings from the Finance Ministry. We have the 
impression that the Finance Ministry held sway in the council, 
or that the ministry's views were included uncritically in the 
plan. 
  [Hosokawa] That is not at all true. Of course, the financial 
authorities are supposed to do their job as the keeper of 
government finances. The ruling coalition parties, and also the 
administration, spoke from their respective standpoints. For 
instance, regarding the term national welfare tax or regarding 
the period of implementation, the ruling coalition parties led 
the decisionmaking process. 
  [Reporter] If you claim that the existing consumption tax is 
to be abolished and that the national welfare tax is to be 
created to be used for welfare purposes, I think it would be 
logically more consistent to designate this as a special-purpose 
tax for welfare. Why would you include this in the general 
revenues? 
  [Hosokawa] I have reiterated this several times tonight. I 
hate to repeat myself, but it would not necessarily be desirable 
to limit the purpose to, say, pensions. Considering that 
welfare today involves various needs in different areas, to meet 
the welfare needs in preparation for the approaching aging 
society, we will be more capable of dealing with the needs of 
the aging society by designating this as general revenue. This 
was the basis for the decision. 
  [Reporter] Because the plan does not have the approval of 
the 
SDPJ, did you make the decision being fully aware of the danger 
that this might pose to the administration? 
  [Hosokawa] Not only the SDPJ. It is true that there are many 
people in all the ruling parties who have reservations about 
this issue. This.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] For instance, some SPDJ members 
hold the radical view that their party should withdraw its 
cabinet members from the administration. Do you think that this 
is unavoidable? 
  [Hosokawa] It is natural that the cabinet should unite to 
deal with this issue, and I said to the SDPJ today that I need 
their cooperation. In this regard, SDPJ cabinet members said 
that while they are members of the cabinet, they are also party 
members. They would like to talk with their party. That was 
what they said, no more and no less. 
  [Reporter] With regard to the issue of taxation, Mr. Prime 
Minister, you used to talk about a reexamination of the ratio of 
direct and indirect taxes, and such other issues. Also, one of 
your major points has been that the people's understanding is 
important. All press briefings in the past never indicated that 
the figure of 7 percent was ever discussed at the meeting of the 
ruling parties' representatives, or at the Council on Economic 
Affairs chaired by Mr. Hata. I think you cannot deny the fact 
that the people will have the impression that this figure came 
up suddenly today. Do you really think the people will approve 
of this figure? 
  [Hosokawa] Deliberations in the Tax Commission are one way 
of 
integrating the people's opinions. The decision was made on the 
basis of prolonged discussions in the commission. Moreover, we 
have three years [before the welfare tax is implemented], and we 
are faced with the situation of a rapidly aging population at a 
rate not found elsewhere in the world. Considering that we have 
to improve welfare and to deal with the aging society, we can 
never handle these by irresponsibly issuing deficit-covering 
bonds. This is not something that a responsible government can 
do. I am sure we can win the people's understanding on this 
point. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, may I? At the time of the 
political reform bills, you took the position that the 
government's proposal was the best but that you had to respect 
the Diet's deliberations. This time, it is expected that there 
will be a lot of opposition on the issue of the tax rate, or 
whether the tax should be a strictly special-purpose tax -- as 
has been discussed today -- within and outside the ruling 
parties. Will you still approach this problem by taking the 
position that the government's proposal is the best but that you 
have to respect the Diet's deliberations? 
  [Hosokawa] It goes without saying that I have to respect the 
Diet's deliberations. 
  [Reporter] Does this mean that there might be some 
amendments? 
  [Hosokawa] Well, I can only say that this would be like the 
case of the political reform bills. 
  [Reporter] Tell us why the national welfare tax is to be 
implemented on 1 April 1997. 
  [Hosokawa] It has often been pointed out that if [the tax] 
comes too soon [after the income tax cut is implemented], it 
would not be effective, that it would not have any effect on the 
economy. The time lag should be extended as much as possible. 
From the point of view of stimulating the economy, I think that 
that is the most sensible decision. And, from the fiscal point 
of view, we have very limited choices. I made the final 
decision while giving as much consideration as possible to both 
factors. 
  [Reporter] I have heard that most, not some, SDPJ 
members oppose the new tax. I am sure you plan to enact the 
bill to introduce the new tax during the current ordinary Diet 
session. Your answer may change depending on how the LDP will 
react to the tax, but are you confident in having the bill 
adopted? 
  [Hosokawa] What I can say now is that I will do my utmost to 
win their understanding. 
  [Reporter] Do you treat the bill the same way as the 
political reform bills? I mean politically.... 
  [Hosokawa] I am not clear what you mean. But this new tax 
is one of basic pillars of economic reform. We asked ourselves 
whether the government should continue having a tight budgetary 
plan, whether it should implement income tax cuts to pull the 
nation out of the current recession, and how it should finance 
the cuts. The introduction of a new tax is the only choice left 
to the government, I believe. Like political reform bills, it 
will not be easy to get the bill adopted. It is true that each 
political party has members who take a cautious approach toward 
this issue. But I have to seek their understanding. For this, 
the government intends to make an all-out effort. 
  [Reporter] If a tax hike is implemented in such a way, many 
people will have apprehensions that the 7-percent tax ratio will 
probably be raised to 11 percent in the future. What do you 
think of this? 
  [Hosokawa] As I have repeatedly said in Diet 
interpellations, the government has the chief objective of 
keeping the national burden rate below 1 percent. I think it is 
very important to introduce the new tax in such a way that it 
does not put too much burden on working generations and the 
generations do not lose interest in working. Based on this 
idea, I made a decision. I am sure the people will understand 
if I explain my idea. 
  [Dean of the press corps] We are running out of time. We 
would like to conclude this conference with a couple more 
questions. 
  [Reporter] There are many points in your explanations that 
are hard to comprehend. It seems that your decision is based on 
a speculation that it will be necessary to introduce a new tax 
three years from now. When you speak to the public, can you 
tell them that your decision is based on a speculation? I 
think, unless you beg, the people will not accept your idea. 
  [Hosokawa] I do not quite understand what you are trying to 
say. There are demands that to deal with the aging society, a 
health care, social infrastructure, medicare, and pension system 
should be improved. I said in a New Year speech that to meet 
these demands, the government has to ask the people to share a 
certain level of the burden. As I said earlier, the government 
has not yet calculated exact figures. But roughly speaking, 
this expression may not be appropriate as you pointed out, but 
roughly speaking, the government has decided on or calculated 
rough figures. I think you understand this. 
  [Reporter] But earlier you said you cannot give figures. If 
you have calculated rough figures, you can tell what they are 
and explain how you obtained them, can't you? 
  [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, the Health and Welfare 
Ministry will formulate a welfare vision and finish the work in 
March. While watching the progress in the ministry's work, the 
government will decide on the ratio of the national welfare tax 
and other figures. The government intends to calculate exact 
figures. My proposal to introduce a new tax is based on this 
plan.

<F P=106> [News conference by Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the </F>
Social Democratic Party of Japan, at the Diet building -- live] 
  [Text] [Dean of the press corps] Now, if there are 
questions to be asked, please go ahead. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Murayama] That is the way I think. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Murayama] No, since there will be a meeting of the party 
Central Executive Committee [CEC] tomorrow -- I mean today. We 
will reconfirm the party position at the committee meeting, and 
inform the prime minister. We will have to draw a clear line 
one way or another. That will be the steps we will take, I 
think. 
  [Reporter] Naturally, cabinet members [of the party] then 
will entrust you with what to do. Will you pull them out of the 
cabinet? 
  [Murayama] I have their understanding that they will follow 
-- in unity -- the party's policy decided on at the CEC meeting 
tomorrow [today]. So, that can happen. 
  [Reporter] Is it possible that this will not happen? 
  [Murayama] Well, that would never happen unless the prime 
minister changes his mind. 
  [Reporter] If this situation persists, it is possible that 
the cabinet will resign en masse or the Diet will dissolve for 
another general election. Of course, you have arrived at this 
decision after thinking about all this, right? 
  [Murayama] At the joint meeting [of coalition party 
representatives], I said that the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] cannot agree [to the prime minister's decision] and 
that a forthcoming decision by the party can affect the 
cabinet's foundation. I asked him if he was aware of all this 
when making the decision -- even though the prime minister's 
response to the question was that he was asking for the SDPJ's 
cooperation so that such a thing would not happen. 
  [Reporter] Had there been no prior consultations on the 
matter of raising the consumption tax to 7 percent? [words 
indistinct] 
  [Murayama] No, not at all. Actually, I have heard him speak 
negatively about raising the consumption tax. I have never 
thought, even in my imagination, that he would make such a 
decision. It has a new name of public welfare tax, but is, in 
substance, just a general revenue source. It is not different 
from the consumption tax. Only its name has changed. Even when 
the consumption tax was first instituted, the government 
insisted time and again that money therefrom would be used for 
welfare. That precedence is only being repeated indeed. 
Nothing has changed in substance. 
  [Reporter] Is there no room for the SDPJ to reconsider its 
position as long as [words indistinct]? 
  [Murayama] First, the government should present its vision 
on welfare, and then submit a list of funds needed to carry out 
projects under such a vision. It should say how much money can 
be raised from insurance and how much money should come from tax 
revenue. If this step is taken, maybe the people will be able 
to agree on the need for the money. But in his announcement, 
there is no mention of such a thing, and only a tax rate is 
presented. However hard he may try to explain it, the people 
will accept it as raising the consumption tax rate, using a new 
name -- the public welfare tax. I told him so. 
  [Reporter] To keep the coalition government in power, your 
party supported the political reform bills even though some in 
the party were against it. Will not some of your party object 
to the party's stand on the tax this time? 
  [Murayama] As long as the prime minister does not change his 
mind, that sort of thing will not happen, I think. 
  [Reporter] That means that as long as the prime minister 
does not change his stand, the SDPJ will come to act as an 
opposition party [several words indistinct]? 
  [Murayama] Either way, tomorrow -- I mean today -- the party 
will decide on a policy. I will talk about that after that is 
done. 
  [Reporter] Will your party object to a budget formulated by 
the government? 
  [Murayama] I think it will if the government formulates the 
budget's taking the tax into it. 
  [Reporter] Is it impossible for the SDPJ to rethink its 
policies on such issues as the rice market liberalization, 
political reform, and so forth now that [words indistinct]? 
  [Murayama] That is something we can think about -- only in 
the future. 
  [Reporter] As far as only this tax issue is concerned, 
is the party in complete agreement? 
  [Murayama] The CEC makes a decision only with a unanimous 
agreement. The committee will reconfirm the party policy on 
that in a unanimous agreement, and then will entrust the party 
chairman and general secretary with the decision making. 
  [Reporter] Do you think there are some party Diet members 
who will not agree to the CEC decision? 
  [Murayama] No, I think we can make a decision unanimously 
this time. [laughter from reporters] 
  [Reporter] In passing the political reform bills recently, 
even though you disagreed with some government concessions to 
the Liberal Democratic Party, you decided to support the bills 
eventually. Is it possible that your stand on the political 
reforms will now change again? 
  [Murayama] Our party would like to make a judgment on other 
matters only after the party's decision on this question has 
been set. [NHK breaks off relay of the news conference here]

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Thursday [3 February] announced a 6 trillion yen tax 
reduction plan that includes 5.3 trillion yen in income and 
resident tax cuts. 
  Hosokawa, announcing the decision at a hastily arranged news 
conference, said the coalition government will propose 
abolishing the 3 percent consumption tax but will instead call 
for imposing a 7 percent national welfare tax. 
  The prime minister said the government plans to make the tax 
cuts retroactive to January 1, 1994, and to impose the new 
national welfare tax April 1, 1997. 
  Hosokawa said he has gained agreement at a meeting of top 
officials of the government and ruling parties.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa announced early Thursday [3 February] his coalition 
government has decided to introduce a new 7 percent "national 
welfare tax" to finance a 6 trillion yen tax cut which will be 
part of government efforts to boost the sluggish economy. 
  However, the Social Democratic Party, the largest of the 
seven parties in Hosokawa's coalition, strongly opposed the plan 
and threatened to withdraw its ministers from the cabinet. 
  Hosokawa told a news conference the government wants to 
introduce the new tax on goods and services April 1, 1997. 
  Speaking at a hurriedly arranged news conference, Hosokawa 
said, "the government has decided to introduce a new national 
welfare tax at a rate of 7 percent, starting from April 1, 1997." 
  "In tandem with the introduction of the national welfare 
tax, 
the current 3 percent consumption tax will be abolished," the 
premier said. 
  "The new tax will be introduced to finance the large cost of 
building up the social infrastructure, improving the people's 
living environment and financing growing welfare expenditures," 
he said. 
  The Hosokawa cabinet will decide Thursday on a 15 trillion 
yen pump-priming package that will include the tax cuts, 
officials said. 
  Hosokawa said part of the additional revenue stemming from 
the new tax will be used to finance planned tax cuts of 6 
trillion yen, of which income and resident tax cuts would 
account for "5.3 trillion yen." 
  Asked by a reporter whether the fresh revenue from the new 
tax would more than offset an immediate revenue shortfall from 
the 6 trillion yen income tax cuts, Hosokawa nodded. 
  "Certainly, the new tax measures would result in a net tax 
increase, starting from fiscal 1997," Hosokawa said, in response 
to the reporter's allegation that the expected 9 trillion yen 
annual revenue from the new tax would produce a net revenue 
increase of up to 2 trillion yen. 
  Hosokawa said his administration will submit to the Diet a 
bill that would replace the current consumption tax with the new 
national welfare tax. 
  He said his administration will not include a provision that 
would obligate the government to spend revenues from the new tax 
solely for the purpose of financing government expenditures 
related to welfare policy. 
  Items of government outlays on which the revenue from the 
new 
tax would be spent "would not be specified" in the text of the 
new tax legislation, Hosokawa said. 
  Hosokawa rejected the Social Democratic Party's argument 
that 
the introduction of the new 7 percent tax would be tantamount to 
raising the rate of the current 3 percent consumption tax. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a late night meeting of 
the leaders of coalition parties that his party cannot accept 
the new tax unless the government includes wording obliging it 
to use all the revenue from the new tax for welfare-related 
expenditures. 
  The party urged Hosokawa to set up a "special account" 
inside 
the state budget -- independent from its general account -- to 
ensure that additional revenue be spent to finance 
welfare-related outlays, while preventing a diversion of 
revenues to expenditures unrelated to welfare, SDP officials 
said. 
  Earlier in the day, most coalition partners agreed to back a 
proposal by the Finance Ministry to offset the tax cuts of 6 
trillion yen with the new 7 percent tax, the officials said. 
  The SDP, by joining the coalition, has lent vital support to 
the Hosokawa administration, enabling it to secure a majority in 
the House of Representatives. 
  The SDP has many opponents of the consumption tax as it 
bolstered its parliamentary strength in the 1989 election on an 
anticonsumption tax platform. 
  The non-SDP coalition partners tried in vain to persuade the 
SDP to accept the revenue-balancing plan, they said. 
  Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato, an SDP legislator, told 
reporters, "Prime Minister Hosokawa asked the SDP chairman to 
accept his tax legislation, but our chairman said the party 
cannot accept such a proposal." 
  The coalition tussle has intensified nine days before 
Hosokawa flies to the United States for talks with President 
Bill Clinton. 
  Hosokawa, whose administration is under U.S. pressure to 
revive the floundering Japanese economy by stimulating stagnant 
consumer spending, is expected to mention some pump-priming 
fiscal package featuring a tax cut at the meeting with Clinton. 
  The non-SDP coalition partners initially tried to alleviate 
the SDP aversion to the tax by putting forward a proposal to 
change the name of the tax to "welfare-purpose tax" from 
"consumption tax," the officials said. 
  Earlier in the day, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a 
meeting of coalition leaders, "the SDP will absolutely not 
tolerate a raise in the rate of the consumption tax." 
  However, other coalition partners are calling for the raise 
to be implemented by the end of 1994, saying they do not want to 
antagonize voters before a House of Councillors election 
expected in the summer of 1995.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO - Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
[SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Thursday his party may 
withdraw its ministers from the coalition cabinet of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa unless he drops a plan to introduce a 
new 7 percent indirect tax, tentatively named a national welfare 
tax. 
  "We may withdraw" the six ministers from Hosokawa's 
21-member 
cabinet, Murayama told a hurriedly arranged news conference in 
the early hours of Thursday morning in response to a reporter's 
question on how the SDP would respond if Hosokawa did not change 
his mind. 
  If the SDP quits the coalition, the Hosokawa cabinet may 
have 
to resign en bloc, political sources said. 
  Murayama blasted Hosokawa for waging a disinformation 
campaign in order to implement what he said would amount to a 
virtual raise in the rate of the current 3 percent consumption 
tax. 
  "Even if the prime minister says Japan needs the new tax to 
cope with an increased welfare outlay for our rapidly aging 
society, the proposed new tax is tantamount to a consumption tax 
hike in essence," he said. 
  He made the statements over an hour after Hosokawa announced 
that his coalition government has decided to introduce the 
"national welfare tax" to offset revenue shortfalls stemming 
from a 6 trillion yen tax cut. 
  Hosokawa told a news conference the government wants to 
introduce the new tax from April 1, 1997. 
  "The new tax will be introduced to finance the large cost of 
building up the social infrastructure, improving the people's 
living environment and financing growing welfare expenditures," 
Hosokawa said. 
  Murayama said the new indirect tax on sales of most goods 
and 
services might dampen consumer spending, saying, "judging from 
the current recession, it is not wise to introduce such a new 
tax." 
  "I told the prime minister that his administration should 
include wording in the new tax legislation that would obligate 
the government to use all the revenue from the new tax for 
expenditures related to welfare," he said. 
  "However, the premier turned a deaf ear to our party's 
request," he said. 
  "With the introduction of the new tax, the administration 
would only have changed the name of the consumption tax and the 
revenue, in actuality, will end up being spent for the general 
account of the state budget," he said. 
  The Japanese public will never accept the government's 
argument that the new tax is necessary unless it explains why it 
needs to introduce such a tax by stating concrete figures and 
the items of outlays related to welfare which the tax will 
finance, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] decided Thursday [3 February] to 
withdraw its six ministers from the cabinet and quit the 
coalition government unless Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
reviews his plan to introduce a "national welfare tax." 
  At a meeting of the party's central executive committee, SDP 
leaders agreed to leave the seven-party coalition if Hosokawa 
refuses to reconsider the 7 percent rate of the "welfare tax" 
and the timing of implementing it. 
  At a predawn news conference, Hosokawa said that the 
government wants to introduce the tax from April 1, 1997 in 
place of the current 3 percent consumption tax to offset revenue 
shortfalls stemming from a 6 trillion yen tax cut. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama accused Hosokawa at a 
separate 
news conference of waging a disinformation campaign in order to 
implement a virtual raise in the rate of the consumption tax. 
Murayama said it would be very difficult for the SDP to continue 
cooperating in the coalition government. 
  The possible defection of the SDP, the largest group in the 
seven-party coalition, would bring Hosokawa's government to its 
greatest crisis since it was inaugurated last August after 
toppling the 38-year-old rule by the Liberal Democratic Party.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] threatened Thursday [3 February] to 
pull its six members from the cabinet unless the government 
amends its plan to impose a 7 percent "national welfare tax" on 
goods and services from 1997. 
  At a meeting of the party's central executive committee, SDP 
leaders agreed to demand that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
insert into the tax legislation a provision that all the revenue 
from the proposed tax be used to finance welfare-related outlays 
only. 
  The SDP also decided to demand the setting up of a 
consultative body to study the rate of the proposed tax and the 
timing of implementing it. 
  Unless these demands are met, the SDP, the largest party in 
the coalition, will pull its cabinet ministers from the Hosokawa 
administration, SDP officials said. 
  The SDP decision came on the heels of Hosokawa's comments 
that items of government outlays to be financed by the "welfare 
tax" would not be specified in the tax legislation. 
  Koken Nosaka, an SDP executive, told reporters Thursday 
morning, "we would not be able to help withdrawing from the 
cabinet" unless the premier dropped his plan to replace the 
current 3 percent consumption tax with the 7 percent "national 
welfare tax." 
  Sadao Yamahana, minister in charge of political reform, and 
five other SDP ministers met Hosokawa on Thursday and urged him 
to reconsider his new tax program. 
  Hosokawa responded by instructing the leaders of the seven 
coalition partners to band together for a meeting later in the 
day to work out a consensus on the tax measure. 
  The tax, whose mechanism is almost identical to that of the 
current consumption tax, is to be imposed on most goods and 
services sold in Japan from April 1, 1997. 
  The SDP, which was in the opposition camp for 38 years of 
the 
postwar Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) rule, succeeded in 
placing six of its legislators in the coalition cabinet last 
August, after the LDP was ousted from power in a general 
election. 
  The SDP had since lent vital support to the coalition 
government. 
  The party holds 76 seats in the 511-member House of 
Representatives, where the coalition now has a combined strength 
of 261, only five seats more than a simple majority of 256. The 
LDP has 222 seats in the lower chamber. 
  In a predawn news conference, Hosokawa said the government 
decided to impose the indirect tax to offset a revenue shortfall 
from planned income and corporate tax cuts and to finance the 
cost of increased welfare expenditures stemming from the rapid 
graying of society. 
  The government is expected to include a 6 trillion yen tax 
cut as a major pillar of a 15 trillion yen pump-priming package 
planned to be decided before Hosokawa's meeting with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii denied early Thursday that the government's decision to 
introduce a new 7 percent tax from 1997 would result in any net 
tax increase after it implements tax cuts worth 6 trillion yen. 
  He was speaking at a press conference held shortly after the 
government decided to abolish the 3 percent consumption tax and 
adopt a 7 percent "national welfare tax" on goods and services 
in April 1997 that will effectively raise the rate of the 
current consumption tax. 
  Fujii said increased revenues from the new tax rate of over 
8 
trillion yen annually will be necessary from now on, citing 800 
billion yen in spending on social welfare, 1.3 trillion yen in 
government goods purchases and 1.4 trillion yen in repayment of 
debt principle. 
  Under a simple calculation, revenues from the new tax will 
exceed the reduced revenues from the tax cuts by some 2 trillion 
yen. 
  Noting that 10 years will be needed to repay bonds worth 18 
trillion yen to be issued to cover the tax cuts over three 
years, Fujii said the decision was a "tough choice" for the 
ministry but that the government's financial position would 
continue to be "tough." 
  On income tax cuts worth 5.3 trillion yen, Fujii said the 
proportion of national income tax and local residential tax cuts 
would be "roughly 7 to 3." 
  Concerning the three-year period before implementation, he 
said the government wants its stimulus package to be announced 
Thursday evening to help the economy on a "full-fledge recovery 
track in fiscal 1994 and a stable growth phase in fiscal 1995," 
and said the third year would be to monitor growth. 
  Asked about the use of revenues from the new tax, Fujii said 
the specifics have yet to be decided but would include pensions 
and improvement of the social infrastructure linked to welfare. 
  He vowed to do his utmost to win public support for the tax 
reform plan but declined to comment on the possibility of 
further tax hikes. 
  Given the decision, the tax commission, an advisory panel to 
the prime minister, is expected to compile its fiscal 1994 tax 
reform report next Tuesday, calling for widening the 
middle-income bracket to ease its tax burdens.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The 7 percent rate decided 
for the new welfare tax just barely meets the required amount 
needed to balance planned income and residential tax cuts worth 
6 trillion yen, a top Finance Ministry official said Thursday [3 
February]. 
  Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press 
meeting 
that if the rate is lowered to 6 percent, the amount of tax cuts 
must also be reduced. 
  "Bond redemptions become impossible with a 6 percent rate, 
an 
8 percent rate generates more than enough revenue," he said. 
  Saito also said his ministry is "not thinking of raising the 
rate (on the new tax) in the future." 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa decided early Thursday on a 
new tax plan, calling for the tax cuts, including 5.3 trillion 
yen in income tax cut and adoption of a new "national welfare" 
tax in three years to replace the current 3 percent consumption 
tax. 
  But the decision, which was made without the approval of the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest in the ruling 
coalition, appears to be set for revision due to that party's 
strong opposition. 
  Saito brushed aside reports that the ministry led the 
government to decide on the plan, saying the naming, timing and 
scope of the new tax were decided by leaders of the coalition 
parties. 
  The ministry just answered their "technical questions," he 
said. 
  With the political row delaying announcement of the 
government's economic stimulus package, which is due Thursday 
evening, Saito said he hopes the package will be implemented "as 
early as possible." 
  Admitting for the first time that past fiscal measures led 
by 
additional public works projects failed to lift the economy, 
Saito said, "the economy remained weak" after only implementing 
public works projects and "we pin hopes on the income tax cut 
(as a means of strengthening the economy)."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- A senior official of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) expressed doubts 
Thursday [3 February] over the government's planned introduction 
of a new 7 percent "national welfare tax" to finance a 6 
trillion yen income tax cut. 
  Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the party's Policy Affairs 
Research Council, told a news conference he could not tell the 
difference between the new tax and the current consumption tax. 
  But he voiced support for a cut in income tax cut announced 
at the same time as the welfare tax in a news conference by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in the early hours of Thursday. 
  Hashimoto said the income tax cut will encourage spending by 
consumers and help recovery from the prolonged economic slump. 
  Hosokawa said his coalition government has decided to 
introduce a new 7 percent national welfare tax to finance a 6 
trillion yen tax cut which will be part of government efforts to 
boost the sluggish economy. 
  He told the news conference the government wants to 
introduce 
the new tax on goods and services on April 1, 1997. 
  But the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest of the 
seven parties in Hosokawa's coalition, strongly opposed the plan 
and threatened to withdraw its ministers from the cabinet. 
  Former Finance [Minister] Michio Watanabe called Hosokawa's 
plan to introduce a "national welfare tax" as an "important 
decision and the sole direction" the government can take. 
  Replying to reporters' question, Watanabe said opposition 
voiced by the LDP to the new tax plan lacks explanation on how 
to balance the planned income tax cut. 
  The LDP "must explain how to implement an income tax break," 
said Watanabe, who heads the third largest LDP faction. 
  He also criticized the SDP's opposition to the "welfare 
tax," 
saying the party is not qualified to be a ruling party. 
  Meanwhile, former Primer Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the 
government should give priority to measures to boost the slumped 
economy which can bring about an increase in overall tax 
revenues. 
  Criticizing the government's plan to create the new tax, 
Miyazawa said he had no idea what basis the figure of 7 percent 
was set. 
  "I oppose the discussion (over the tax) without evidence of 
figures such as economic growth rates," Miyazawa said.

<F P=106> [By Kohei Murayama] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance 
faced renewed political pressure Thursday [3 February] after the 
government earlier announced a new tax plan that complies with 
the ministry's strong demand to guarantee funding for income tax 
cuts. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii made light of the issue in 
his meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Mickey Kantor, quipping 
that "the political weather is bad." 
  But the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] -- 
the largest party in the ruling coalition -- continued to demand 
revision of the tax plan, which was announced in the early hours 
of the same day by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa without SDP 
approval. 
  An SDP official said the party will quit the coalition 
unless 
there are changes in the timing and scope of a new welfare tax 
intended to pay for a cut in income tax. 
  Hosokawa was quoted by one of his ministers as saying that 
he 
may change his decision in line with a compromise reached at a 
meeting later of coalition party leaders. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura also told a 
regular morning press meeting that the government is ready to 
revise the plan. A revision, if made, would be a reversal for 
the Finance Ministry, which had won its call for the offsetting 
tax in the face of strong opposition from the SDP. 
  The plan calls for tax cuts of 6 trillion yen, including 5.3 
trillion yen in national income tax and local resident's tax, to 
be paid for by a 7 percent national welfare tax on goods and 
services from April 1997 in place of the current 3 percent 
consumption tax. 
  In a last-ditch effort to end the continuing row, which 
appeared likely to delay the announcement of an economic 
stimulus package due out in the evening, some SDP leaders 
visited Finance Minister Fujii, but both sides declined to 
comment on the meeting. 
  Meanwhile, the ministry issued a detailed report explaining 
the financial justification for the 7 percent rate of the 
welfare tax. 
  The report appeared intended to clarify Fujii's press 
remarks 
shortly after the government decision early Thursday in which he 
denied there would be any net tax increases. 
  The new tax is expected to generate revenues of some 9.5 
trillion yen a year, while the tax cuts total only 6 trillion 
yen, the ministry said. 
  As for the net 3.5 trillion in net revenues, it cited some 
800 billion yen in additional welfare spending, about 1.3 
trillion yen in tax burdens from the new tax on government 
purchases of goods and services, and repayment of principal of 
some 1.4 trillion yen for short-term government bonds. 
  The government needs to issue about 18 billion yen worth of 
"bridge" bonds to cover the three-year period before 
implementation of the new tax, and principal repayments will 
take over 10 years. The repayment period would be longer when 
including interest, the report said. 
  In his press remarks, Fujii vowed his utmost efforts to win 
public support and stressed that revenues would be for social 
welfare. 
  Unlike the consumption tax, the new tax would be introduced 
by a law defining it as "a politically objective tax," Fujii 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance 
(MOF) issued a report Thursday [3 February] explaining the 
financial reasoning behind the 7 percent rate of a new national 
welfare tax in an apparent bid to win public support for it. 
  The move also appeared intended to clarify remarks to 
reporters by Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii early Thursday 
denying any intention of a net tax increase in the new tax plan 
decided by the government. 
  The plan calls for 6 trillion yen worth of tax cuts, 
including 5.3 trillion yen in national income and local 
resident's tax, to be paid for by the new 7 percent tax, to be 
adopted in April 1997 in place of the current 3 percent 
consumption tax. 
  The MOF said the new tax is expected to generate new 
revenues 
of some 9.5 billion yen a year, while the tax cuts amount to 6 
trillion yen. 
  Regarding the net revenues of 3.5 trillion yen, it cited 
some 
800 billion yen needed in additional welfare spending, about 1.3 
trillion yen in increased burdens from the new tax on government 
purchases of goods and services, and some 1.4 trillion yen in 
repayments of principal on bonds. 
  The ministry estimates that some 18 trillion yen in 
short-term government bonds must be issued to cover the 
three-year period before implementation of the new tax, and over 
10 years are needed for principal repayments, or longer if 
interest is included. 
  Referring to the three-year time lag before adopting the new 
tax, Fujii told reporters that the government hopes to get the 
economy on a full-fledged recovery track in fiscal 1994 and into 
stable growth in fiscal 1995. The extra year is to monitor 
economic growth, he said. 
  He pledged utmost efforts to win public support for the new 
tax and stressed that revenues would go to social welfare. 
  Unlike the consumption tax, the new tax would be introduced 
by a law stipulating that it is "politically objective," Fujii 
said. 
  Details are yet to be decided but will include pensions and 
social infrastructure for welfare primarily in line with a 
government "welfare vision" to be compiled by March, Fujii said. 
  Meanwhile, Fujii did not rule out the possibility of raising 
the new tax rate further in future.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- A government plan to impose a 
7 percent tax on goods and services from 1997 has room for 
modifications in consideration of the strong opposition within 
the ruling coalition, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
indicated Thursday [3 February]. 
  Touching on the resistance from the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) to the tax plan, the top government spokesman said at a 
news conference, "if the SDP's stance stays unchanged today, I 
am afraid the situation will be serious for the ruling 
coalition." 
  The SDP has threatened to quit the coalition government 
unless Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa modifies the plant to 
introduce a 7 percent "national welfare tax" to replace the 3 
percent consumption tax. 
  Takemura said the government plan might be revised if such a 
revision would help win public support for the introduction of 
the tax. 
  He also expressed hope the government will narrow down 
differences through dialogue with the SDP, which is the largest 
contingent in the seven-party coalition. 
  The chief cabinet secretary said the government and the SDP 
will hold fence-mending talks Thursday, but he declined to 
comment on the possibility of the government retracting the tax 
plan outright. 
  The planned 7 percent indirect tax is scheduled to take 
effect on April 1, 1997. 
  Saying the decision-making process concerning the tax in the 
face of the SDP's opposition was "unusual," Takemura 
acknowledged it was not all done in the right manner. 
  Takemura said there is no change in the Thursday evening 
schedule of the announcement of a 15 trillion yen fresh economic 
package that includes the large-scale income tax reduction. But 
a policy-making body of the coalition was forced to put off a 
Thursday morning meeting to approve the stimulus program due to 
a boycott by SDP members. 
  As a result, the announcement of the additional economic 
package appears certain to be delayed from the original schedule.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Thursday [3 February] expressed willingness to 
modify details of a new indirect tax in response to criticism 
from the largest party in the ruling coalition, a cabinet member 
said. 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, one of the six cabinet 
members from the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which opposes 
the new tax, told reporters Hosokawa said he is "ready to modify 
my decision to introduce the tax if the leaders of coalition 
partners approve of such change in their meeting." 
  Hosokawa told fellow Diet members of the Japan New Party 
that 
the SDP was "indispensable" for the coalition, adding, "if the 
ruling coalition tells me to do something, I am not concerned 
about saving face." 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference the Hosokawa administration is ready to modify the 
details of the new indirect tax, tentatively called a national 
welfare tax. 
  The chief cabinet spokesman said the administration is ready 
"to correct the wrong" if it helps defend the unity of the 
coalition and alleviate public dislike of the new tax proposal. 
  The premier instructed the leaders of the coalition partners 
to band together for a meeting on Thursday afternoon to work out 
a consensus over the issue prior to the announcement of the 
government's expected 15 trillion yen pump-priming package, 
coalition officials said. 
  Hosokawa reportedly plans to cite the package in his summit 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton on February 11 to alleviate 
U.S. criticism of what the U.S. sees as Japan's insufficient 
efforts to rekindle its stagnant consumer spending and whittle 
down its trade surplus. 
  Igarashi made the remarks after he and other five ministers 
from the SDP called on Hosokawa at the premier's official 
residence to demand a change in the new tax plan. 
  It was not immediately known whether Hosokawa was ready to 
comply with the SDP's chief demand to insert into the text of 
the new tax bill wording that would obligate the government to 
spend all the fresh revenue from the new tax on welfare. 
  Under Japan's revenue structure, the government can set up 
an 
independent account inside the state budget -- apart from its 
general account -- for accepting and disbursing fresh revenues 
from a new tax, if it wants to spend all the revenues from the 
new tax for a specific purpose. 
  Hosokawa's remark came a few hours after the SDP leadership 
decided to stick to its demand urging the coalition to amend the 
tax plan and threatened to withdraw its six ministers from the 
cabinet unless the demand is met. 
  The SDP criticized the welfare tax as a ploy to persuade the 
public to accept a virtual tax increase by merely changing the 
name of the consumption tax. 
  The new 7 percent tax, whose mechanism is almost identical 
to 
that of the current 3 percent consumption tax, is to be imposed 
on most goods and services. 
  In a news conference in the early hours of Thursday, 
Hosokawa 
said the government decided to impose the new tax to offset a 
revenue shortfall from planned income tax cuts and finance the 
cost of increased welfare spending due to the rapidly graying 
society. 
  He said the government wants to introduce the new tax to 
offset a revenue shortfall stemming from the income tax cut of 6 
trillion yen, starting from April 1, 1997. 
  The SDP, which has insisted on the abolition of the 
consumption tax, bolstered its parliamentary strength in a 1989 
House of Councillors election shortly after the then LDP 
administration of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita introduced the 
tax. 
  Since joining the seven-party coalition, the SDP has been 
forced to accept compromises over key issues such as the opening 
of Japan's rice market last year and political reform in January. 
  The SDP said in December that it opposed a GATT compromise 
proposal on partially opening the rice market, but had no choice 
but to abide by Hosokawa's decision to accept the plan. 
  The party was forced to accept a compromise plan on 
political 
reform bills reached between Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei 
Kono during last-ditch talks, for fear that the SDP's opposition 
might bring about collapse of the coalition government.
