  [Text] A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a press 
statement [tamhwa] on 9 February denouncing and rejecting the 
U.S. State Department for recently babbling as if there were a 
so-called human right problem in our country. 
  The press statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry: 
  In its Annual Report on the World Human Rights Situation 
published on 1 February, the U.S. State Department groundlessly 
slandered our country while denouncing various countries' human 
rights situation. The United States once against babbled as if 
there were a human rights problem in our country. This is a 
gross distortion of the reality in our country and a 
fabrication, which is not at all worthy of discussion. 
  Regarding human rights, it is sociopolitical, economic, and 
cultural rights -- including the right to have dignity, 
sovereignty, existence, equality, and development [palchongwon] 
-- which must be guaranteed to man in society. All these rights 
are fully ensured in our country. 
  Our people are genuine masters of the state and society and 
enjoy an independent and creative life equally without any 
social and political uncertainty [pulan] or any worry about 
their life under our socialist system centered on the popular 
masses. In our country there is not a single unemployed person, 
nor a beggar, nor a homeless person, nor an illiterate, nor a 
drug addict. Our country is a state where human rights are 
respected and surely guaranteed. This notwithstanding, the 
United States maliciously slandered our country. This is part 
of its brazen scheme to tarnish the image of our Republic with 
the nonsensical human rights problem as it does with our 
fictitious nuclear problem and to isolate and crush our 
socialist cause. 
  How on earth does the United States have the gall to 
criticize others on the human rights issue? At present, in the 
United States there are more than 1.4 million prisoners, over 9 
million unemployed people, millions of homeless people 
[pangnangja], and 35 million people living below the poverty 
line [pingungson]. It is plagued with murder, which claims the 
lives of more than 38,000 people a year; with drug consumption, 
which accounts for 65 percent of the world's drug use; and with 
narcotic-related crimes, which are very common. This is 
inevitable and is an incurable cancer under the present U.S. 
social system. The U.S. President himself could not but admit 
in his State of the Union address this year the grave phenomena 
threatening U.S. society, including violent crime. 
  We see almost every day that the United States not only 
harshly [hoksimhage] tramples upon the human rights of its 
people, but also perpetrates inhumane acts of high-handedly 
interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, openly 
overthrowing and destroying sovereign states with the 
mobilization of its state Armed Forces, and reeking havoc 
[hwangpyehwa] on their people's human rights. 
  All these facts prove that the United States is the 
universally recognized worst barren land [pulmoji] of human 
rights and the kingdom of human rights infringement. It is 
unreasonable for the United States to talk about other's human 
rights situation, while freely violating human rights within and 
without. 
  In its Report on the Human Rights Situation, the U.S. State 
Department tried to beautify South Korea in a farfetched way, 
claiming that the situation of human rights has been improved 
there. This is also the height of sarcasm [igot yoksi kagwani 
anilsuopta]. It is well-known that South Korea is the most 
barren land of human rights. 
  The South Korean authorities under the mask of civilian 
government are more frantically kicking up rackets of terrorism, 
arrest, torture, and murder while further adhering to the 
National Security Law and other fascist laws and repressive 
tools than the preceding military dictators. The cases of 
infringing upon human rights by the occupying U.S. forces in 
South Korea are countless. 
  Regarding the present South Korean situation in which human 
rights infringements have reached extremes, the United States 
dares argue that the human rights situation has improved there. 
This is really a brazen-faced deception. 
  We sternly denounce and reject the unreasonable activity of 
the United States, which slanders our Republic while talking 
about fictitious human rights problems, as the sovereign 
infringement activity proceeding from a political purpose to 
crush our system and as a hostile activity of intervening in 
internal affairs. Whatever ruckus the United States may raise 
over the human rights problem, it can never impair the essential 
advantages and invincible vitality of socialism of our style to 
which the chuche idea is applied. 
  The United States should mind its own business instead of 
criticizing at will other nations and instructing them, while 
acting as if it were a judge of human rights whom nobody 
recognizes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Anti-dialogue, Antireunification </F>
Confrontation Commotions Are Being Perpetrated More Viciously"] 
  [Text] With the beginning of the new year, the Kim 
Yong-sam group's anti-dialogue and antireunification 
confrontation commotions have been perpetrated more viciously. 
  As was already reported, the South Korean ruling bunch 
blocked the visit to Seoul by our side's delegation of 
condolence to attend the funeral service for Rev. Mun Ik-hwan. 
In addition, it frustrated the Panmunjom contact between the 
Chondoist delegates of the North and the South to jointly 
commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Kabo farmers war, thus 
blocking the joint commemoration of the anniversary by the North 
and the South. 
  On 17 January, the South Korean ruling bunch arrested and 
imprisoned in the fascist prison Ho Hyun-chong, senior in 
Chonbuk University in South Korea, on the charge of violation of 
the notorious National Security Law, claiming that he had 
dialogue through international telephone line with the delegates 
of the North during the first conference of joint chairmen of 
the National Alliance of Youth and Students for National 
Reunification [Pomchonghangnyon] last year in the capacity of 
South side's vice chairman of Pomchonghangnyon. 
  Some time ago, the puppet district court in Kwangju staged a 
court trial for five Chonnam University students who studied and 
researched the immortal chuche idea, and sentenced all of them 
to prison terms. 
  The North-South confrontation commotions and cruel 
oppression 
of democratic reunification forces which have been perpetrated 
by the Kim Yong-sam group more viciously with the beginning of 
the new year fully revealed its antinational and 
antireunification traitorous color. 
  By blocking our side's delegation of condolence which wanted 
to visit Seoul to attend the funeral ceremony of Rev. Mun 
Ik-hwan, the Kim Yong-sam group exposed itself as the group of 
peerless traitors and separatists who totally discarded 
conscience and essential etiquette and morality as a human 
being, being engrossed with commotions on division and 
confrontation. 
  Besides, the Kim Yong-sam group blocked the joint 
commemoration of the events marking the 100th anniversary of 
Kabo farmers war, which was carried out to safeguard the 
national spirit under the ideal of rejecting foreign aggressors 
and promoting the people's welfare by defending the country. 
Thus, the Kim Yong-sam group showed its true color as the group 
of antinational ill-bred hooligans who disgraced our forefathers. 
  Those who cruelly oppressed the innocent youth, students and 
people, who called for national reunification, at the point of 
guns and bayonets cannot have any intent for reunification. 
  The puppets are, in actuality, running wild in an attempt to 
crush us in collusion with outside forces on a pretext of 
suspicion of nuclear arms development by the North. They are 
trying to stage large-scale exercise of a northward war of 
aggression, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise, 
together with outside forces, thus aggravating tension of the 
nation to an extreme pitch. They are bringing dark clouds of 
nuclear war over the heads of fellow countrymen and viciously 
maneuvering to realize the international cooperation system and 
so-called sanctions against us by clinging to sleeves of outside 
forces. 
  They even opened rice markets in South Korea in an attempt 
to 
block third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. Moreover, they begged 
outside forces to set up an international cooperation system in 
an attempt to oppose our package solution plan for the 
resolution of the nuclear problem. 
  The vicious maneuvers of the Kim Yong-sam group to aggravate 
North-South relations and to block the road to reunification 
evoked indignation of fellow countrymen who want reunification. 
  It is unanimous intent of the South Korean people that the 
Kim Yong-sm separatist regime must be overthrown in order to 
achieve national reconciliation, unity and reunification that 
all fellow countrymen are aspiring to. 
  The South Korean people, who cannot live without 
reunification, absolutely will not tolerate the Kim Yong-sam 
group, the most vicious enemy of reunification who is 
frantically running amok to block the national reunification 
under the veil of civilian government.

<F P=106> ["Traitor Must Be Punished" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 10 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam and "chairman" of the "Democratic Liberal Party (DLP)" 
Kim Chong-pil recently contented that re-negotiation on the 
matter of rice market opening is impossible and the struggle of 
peasants and other people against the opening of the rice market 
is an act "of those ignorant of the world". Commenting on this 
NODONG SINMUN today says: This indicates that the most 
despicable traitors are racing headlong along the road of 
treacheries after committing a heinous crime never to be 
condoned. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam promised the opening of the rice 
market in exchange for "an international cooperation system" 
directed against the North. This is an unpardonable treachery 
to strangle the South Korean peasants inside and slay the fellow 
countrymen in the North with the sword of foreign forces 
outside. The peasants and other people of South Korea have 
been driven to the wall where they must decide whether to calmly 
wait for death by allowing the influx of foreign farm products 
or to survive by rising up in a fight against it. 
  If the rice, the blood and flesh of the fellow countrymen, 
is 
to be defended, the Kim Yong-sam treacherous regime which has 
flung open the gate of the rice market must be overthrown. The 
South Korean people of all strata who value the existence of the 
nation and want to live with patriotic minds should unite and 
form one front, intensify the struggle to topple the Kim 
Yong-sam traitor clique and completely remove the cursed fascist 
treacherous regime. 
  A stick is fit for a mad dog. A sledge hammer must be 
brought down on the head of the traitor Kim Yong-sam who is 
steeped in treacheries and fascist repression.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 9 February commentary: "Impudent Outbursts </F>
for Aggression"] 
  [Text] The Japanese reactionaries, who have adhered to the 
hostile policy against our Republic, are openly revealing their 
ambition for reaggression on the Korean peninsula. Ichiro 
Ozawa, representative of the Japan Renewal Party, who is known 
to be a behind-the-scenes coordinator of the Japanese coalition 
government, raved in an interview with Japanese FUJI Television 
on 6 February, which will serve as actual evidence. While 
saying that our Republic might take military action, he stressed 
that Japan should examine countermeasures to cope with an 
emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  In addition, he did not hesitate to utter outbursts 
slandering our system. Ozawa's utterances are an impudent 
challenge to our Republic's dignity and authority and a 
dangerous aggressive outburst that betrays the heinous intention 
of the Japanese reactionaries by playing the role of a shock 
brigade for the imperialists in isolating and crushing our 
socialism. In addition, his utterances are premeditated 
strategic moves to find a pretext for reinforcement of the 
Japanese Armed Forces, the conversion of Japan into a military 
power, and the promotion of nuclear armament in particular. 
  Now, going against the global trends of disarmament and 
detente since the Cold War collapsed, Japan has increased 
military expenditures and has taken to the road to convert Japan 
into a military power. The Japanese people raise their voices 
against such a plan. The Japanese reactionaries, by kicking up 
further clamorous commotions about our threat, are trying to 
influence social opinion into supporting the conversion of Japan 
into a military power and its nuclear armament. 
  Ozawa talked about our military action. This can be termed a 
shock propaganda [chunggyok sonjon] to accomplish their purpose. 
However clamorously Ozawa may make jargon about our threat, the 
people who judge things correctly will not believe the jargon. 
  The Japanese moves to become a military power and attain 
nuclear armament, in particular, give rise to the serious 
apprehension of the Asian people and the people of the world. 
  Sam Nunn, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Forces 
Committee, 
said that Japan can develop nuclear weapons at any moment. The 
British paper, SUNDAY TIMES, reported that Japan might have 
already produced atomic bombs. The world believes that Japan, 
with its huge stockpile of plutonium, can become a nuclear power 
in a short time, if it decides to. 
  Japan has already opened the way for dispatching troops 
overseas. Japan is going to embark upon reinvasion of Asia, with 
Korea as the first target. It is Ozawa who claimed that if a 
war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the Japanese 
Self-Defense Forces should be sent there as a member of the UN 
forces. 
  Ozawa's call for examining countermeasures to cope with the 
event of an emergency on the Korean peninsula revealed Japan's 
intention to complete preparations for aggression on Korea and 
expedite the date of military action. Ozawa's outbursts are 
graver, because the United States and the South Korean puppets 
are babbling about our threat and strengthening the moves for a 
northward invasion. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' belligerent utterances and 
movements show that Japan has become a hotbed of dangerous 
aggression and nuclear war. Thus the world people should 
enhance vigilance against this. Our people will never allow 
anyone to infringe upon the dignity and sovereignty of our 
Republic and hurl mud at our socialism. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, mindful 
that the conversion of Japan into a military power, its nuclear 
armament, and a war of aggression would lead them to destruction.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 8 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] 
-- Paek Han-ki, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee 
of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongnyon), issued a statement on February 8 denouncing Ichiro 
Ozawa, representative of the Japan Renewal Party, who took issue 
with the DPRK by raising outcries over its "completion of 
nuclear arms development" and "nuclear armament." 
  Condemning Ozawa's outburst as an unpardonable insult and 
challenge to the Korean people, he in the statement said: 
  "We demand that Ozawa immediately withdraw and apologize for 
his grave remarks that insulted the DPRK and the Korean people 
and threatened peace and security on the Korean peninsula. 
  "We hope conscientious politicians including those of the 
ruling party and broad Japanese people will not overlook Ozawa's 
remarks but make efforts to get the Japanese authorities' Korea 
policy rectified. 
  "The Korean citizens in Japan will in the future, too, 
develop friendly relations with the Japanese people on the basis 
of the idea of independence, friendship and peace."

<F P=106> ["MINJU CHOSON on Japan's Nuclear Armament Scheme" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 10 (KCNA) -- Japan is going to 
put into operation Monju, the first fast breeder reactor, in a 
short time while shipping in large quantities of plutonium from 
other countries. Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today 
denounces this as an undisguised move to become a nuclear power 
any moment. 
  The analyst points out: 
  Japan has already developed not only devices and 
technologies 
for the manufacture of nuclear bombs but also long-distance 
nuclear delivery means. The danger of Japan's nuclear armament 
presents itself as a thing of the present-day reality, not of a 
distant future. Japan's nuclear armament poses a grave threat 
to peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast 
Asia and, further, in the rest of the world. We cannot but 
counter with vigilance the grave situation in which Japan's 
nuclear armament is being promoted in the full-scale stage 
around the Korean peninsula. As we have declared more than 
once, our people who value the dignity and independence of the 
nation as their own life are fully prepared to retaliate on any 
manoeuvrings of the aggressors. 
  If nuclear-free peace and security is to be actually 
guaranteed in Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula, the 
overall denuclearization of this region must be achieved. For 
this purpose, the people of Asia and the rest of the world 
should pay due attention to Japan's hastened nuclear armament. 
  The denuclearisation of Northeast Asia must be realised 
without fail and it should lead to the total abolition of 
nuclear weapons worldwide.

  [Text] Osaka, February 7 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] 
-- The Japan Liaison Council of Societies for the Study of the 
Works of Kim Chong-il was formed. 
  It is a national organization of societies and groups which 
had been formed throughout Japan since the appearance of the 
society and group for the study of the works of Kim Chong-il in 
Tokyo in March last year. 
  The inaugural meeting of the council took place in Osaka on 
February 5. 
  Present there were chairmen and members of the societies and 
groups from different parts of Japan and Japanese people, more 
than 390 in all. 
  Kenichi Ogami, secretary general of the International 
Institute of the Chuche Idea (IIJI) and advisor of the council, 
made an opening address, which was followed by speeches of 
director general of the IIJI Shuhachi Inoue and Director General 
of the Centre of Socialist Theories and Politics Oen Araki and a 
congratulatory speech of first vice-chairman of the Central 
Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), Yi Chin-gyu. 
  Prof. Takao Kamakura of Saitama University who is chief 
advisor of the council made a keynote report at the meeting. 
  Stating that the council was being formed on the basis of 
the 
activities to study and disseminate the chuche idea, in keeping 
with the new requirements of the time, he said: 
  "Our primary task is to learn from the idea, theories and 
methods of Secretary Kim Chong-il through the study of his works. 
  "Firstly, Secretary Kim Chong-il has faithfully and 
correctly 
inherited the theoretical and practical activities of President 
Kim Il-song and further developed in depth the theoretical and 
practical matters concerning the revolution and construction in 
compliance with the new requirements of the internal and 
external situation. 
  "He is the successor to the revolutionary cause of President 
Kim Il-song, who has carried it forward most correctly and the 
leader of the era of independence. 
  "Secondly, Secretary Kim Chong-il formulated the president's 
revolutionary idea as Kimilsongism, an integral system of idea, 
theories and methods based on the philosophical principle of 
chuche." 
  Referring to the theoretical activities of Secretary Kim 
Chong-il, the reporter said: 
  "He said modern imperialism employs a very crafty method of 
domination and plunder and its aggressive nature remains 
unchanged. He clarified the reason for the collapse of socialism 
in former Soviet Union and eastern European countries and 
theorized the principles of anthropocentric socialism and 
communism based on the chuche idea. 
  "He has inherited the revolutionary mass line of President 
Kim Il-song, who has established the method of leadership for 
enhancing the ideological consciousness of the masses and 
guiding them to display their independence and creativity under 
the leadership of the party, and has carried it into practice. 
  "Secretary Kim Chong-il, true to the teachings of the 
president calling for believing in the people as in heaven and 
respecting the people as the teacher and learning from them, has 
served the people, regarding them as the greatest beings." 
  The meeting also heard a report of the secretariat of the 
council on the course of its inauguration and the 
characteristics and activities of the societies and the council. 
  Read at the meeting was a declaration on the inauguration of 
the council. 
  A letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted at the meeting. 
  Earlier, conferences of societies for the study of the works 
of Kim Chong-il were held in local areas. The statute of the 
council and a declaration on its inauguration were adopted and 
its officials were selected there. 
  A banquet was arranged on the evening of February 5 in

  [Text] Osaka, February 7 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] 
-- An inaugural declaration was adopted at the inaugural meeting 
of the Japan Liaison Council of Societies for the Study of the 
Works of Kim Chong-il which took place here on February 5. 
  The aim of the study societies is to learn from Secretary 
Kim 
Chong-il and disseminate and study his works, the declaration 
said, adding that their formation means signalling the advent of 
a new era which is guided by his idea and theory. 
  It declared that the process of activities of the societies 
for the study of Kim Chong-il's works would be a process in 
which independence of man would be held dearest, people would 
cooperate with each other and unity based on love and trust be 
expanded throughout society. 
  It is none other than Secretary Kim Chong-il who fully 
inherited and developed the revolutionary cause of chuche and 
opened a new horizon of revolutionary struggle, the declaration 
said, and went on: 
  Secretary Kim Chong-il is an illustrious leader who has 
faithfully carried forward and developed the leadership and 
exploits of President Kim Il-song. 
  He defined the revolutionary idea of President Kim Il-song 
as 
Kimilsongism, an integral system of ideology, theory and 
methodology based on the philosophical principle of chuche. 
  Drawing himself on the inheritance of the revolutionary idea 
of President Kim Il-song, he has further enriched the 
ideological and theoretical content of the chuche idea in 
compliance with the requirements of the present times and the 
new stage of development of the revolution. 
  One of the great exploits of secretary Kim Chong-il, the 
leader of the Korean revolution, is that he has strengthened the 
politico- ideological unity and cohesion of the masses of people 
and brought their creative ingenuity into full play by 
strengthening the party and enhancing its leadership role. 
  Inheriting President Kim Il-song's politics of love and 
trust 
in comrades and the people, Secretary Kim Chong-il loves the 
revolutionary forerunners, comrades and people and shapes 
politics of love and trust throughout society. 
  As it is the maxim of President Kim Il-song that one should 
believe in the people as in heaven, so Secretary Kim Chong-il 
regards the people as the greatest beings and takes it as his 
creed to respect and regard them as heaven. 
  The societies for the study of works, putting main emphasis 
on activities for the study and dissemination of the works of 
Secretary Kim Chong-il in keeping with their nature and tasks as 
academic study organizations, will conduct activities such as 
lectures and organization of seminars on his works, invitation 
of delegations and dispatch of visiting groups to Korea and 
periodic publication of information. 
  They will build themselves into groups which will be the 
first to personify the looks of an ideal society, the 
everlasting future of mankind, in which the masses of people are 
welded together by love and trust, and foster their 
socio-political organism, the seed of love and trust of the 
collective, within them. And the societies for learning from 
Secretary Kim Chong-il in different areas will keep in contact 
and cooperate with each other, share the same mind, demonstrate 
their advantages to many people and thus rally them in the 
societies. 
  The declaration called for forcefully advancing, upholding 
the idea and theory of Secretary Kim Chong-il, with the pride of 
walking together with broad sections of people a road where a 
new prospect is visible.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- MINJOK SIBO, a 
newspaper of Koreans published in Japan, February 1 in an 
article strongly demanded the United States and the South Korean 
authorities officially announce that they would discontinue the 
"Team Spirit" war maneuvers and all other military exercises. 
  Noting with resentment that the United States and the South 
Korean puppet authorities are scheming to hold new large-scale 
military exercises integrating "Ulchi" and "Focus Lens" joint 
military exercises, the paper said this is a grave challenge to 
peace and reconciliation. 
  It warned that if the United States and the South Korean 
authorities continued to cling to war maneuvers, they would be 
held wholly responsible for all consequences arising therefrom.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japan and the U.S. 
headed toward a showdown Wednesday [9 February] over a plethora 
of trade issues as both sides hardened their positions before 
Friday's summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
President Bill Clinton. 
  Under orders from U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, 
U.S. negotiators suspended a series of high-level negotiations 
with their Japanese counterparts scheduled for Wednesday. 
  Kantor told reporters he decided to terminate the subcabinet 
talks which he said would "create more and more frustration 
among the negotiators of both sides if we continue." 
  The Clinton administration has demanded that Tokyo make a 
firm commitment to reducing its massive current account surplus, 
which totaled 141 billion dollars last year, including a nearly 
60 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States. 
  In particular, Washington wants the Japanese to buy more 
foreign cars and auto parts, medical and telecommunications 
equipment, and insurance, the three industry sectors currently 
the focus of negotiations between Tokyo and Washington. 
  Kantor's surprise move angered Japanese negotiators and left 
the task of hammering out any agreement to a direct showdown 
with Japan's foreign minister Tsutomu Hata, who arrived in 
Washington late Wednesday. 
  Officials have set make-or-break trade talks for Thursday 
between Hata and Kantor. 
  "I have brought no new proposals in my luggage," Hata told 
KYODO NEWS SERVICE while en route to Washington. 
  "The situation is extremely critical. Both sides need to 
make mutual concessions, if possible," he said. 
  Hosokawa is due to meet with Clinton on Friday, but Tokyo 
decided to send Hata to Washington a day ahead of schedule to 
give the stalled trade talks a final push. 
  Senior Japanese officials who have been involved in 
negotiating with Washington were visibly annoyed by what they 
regarded as Kantor's high-handed negotiating style. 
  "I suppose I can pack up and go back to Japan now," one 
disgruntled Japanese official said. 
  Kantor, who met with a group of Japanese reporters at the 
white house on Wednesday afternoon, emphasized that his "get 
tough" strategy has the full support of the president. 
  Clinton "has made it clear to us" that no agreement is 
better 
than a bad agreement, Kantor said. 
  The impasse, both Japanese and U.S. officials say, centers 
on 
how to measure progress on foreign access to and performance in 
the Japanese market. 
  Washington has insisted on using "quantitative measures" of 
progress, a step which Tokyo has rejected as anathema to free 
trade. 
  Hata also reiterated Japan's opposition to the U.S. demand 
for import targets, saying, "we have to stick to our principles." 
  Such measures would result in managed trade, which runs 
counter to the "ongoing deregulation" championed by the Hosokawa 
government, Hata said. 
  Kantor admitted that "there may or may not be an agreement" 
by the time Hosokawa and Clinton meet on Friday and repeated a 
warning that the U.S. will "reevaluate" its economic relations 
with Japan if the talks collapse. 
  He declined to specify what steps Washington would take 
other 
than to say, "we have numerous options." 
  U.S. lawmakers who have backed the Clinton administration's 
aggressive trade policy on Japan were less reticent. 
  "Super 301 is still the best approach to Japan," said 
senator 
Max Baucus, referring to the lapsed U.S. trade legislation which 
mandates trade sanctions against countries engaging in unfair 
trade practices. 
  Baucus, the democratic chairman of the Senate Subcommittee 
on 
Trade, said he has received "plenty of signals" from the Clinton 
administration that it will restore super 301 if trade talks 
with Japan sour.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japanese Deputy Prime 
Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata arrived in Washington 
on Wednesday [9 February] night to try to break a deadlock in 
the stalled framework trade talks between Japan and the United 
States. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor earlier in the day 
announced the suspension of working-level negotiations until 
Hata's arrival in the hope that a Japanese political decision 
could lead to a breakthrough. 
  The talks, which had resumed in Washington early this week, 
stalled due to a squabble over how to measure Japan's efforts to 
open its auto and other markets. 
  Hata is to join Friday's summit meeting between Prime 
minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Japan's Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata ended talks with U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor on Thursday [10 February] aimed at breaking an 
impasse in the stalled bilateral framework trade talks. 
  The details are not yet known. But Hata later told reporters 
he will hold one or two more rounds of talks with Kantor before 
Friday's meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. 
  "Both Japan and the U.S. hope to bring the trade talks to a 
conclusion," said Hata, also deputy prime minister. 
  The meeting was held as Japan and the United States head 
toward a showdown over a plethora of trade issues before the 
summit. 
  Hata arrived in Washington late Wednesday on an emergency 
mission seeking U.S. understanding of the Japanese position. He 
said he was bringing no new proposals to Washington. 
  Tokyo has turned down a U.S. demand that numerical targets 
be 
set to measure the progress in opening Japan's markets, saying 
they would result in managed trade. 
  Hata is also scheduled to hold separate talks with Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher and Vice President Albert Gore 
before the leaders' meeting. 
  Under orders from U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, U.S. 
negotiators suspended a series of high-level trade negotiations 
with their Japanese counterparts scheduled for Wednesday. 
  The Clinton administration has demanded that Tokyo make a 
firm commitment to reduce its massive current account surplus, 
which totaled 141 billion dollars last year, including a nearly 
60 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. 
  In particular, Washington wants the Japanese to buy more 
foreign cars and auto parts, medical and telecommunications 
equipment, and insurance. U.S. Government sources have said 
Washington might impose trade sanctions against Japan if no 
agreement is reached. 
  In Tokyo, a top Foreign Ministry official said Japan will 
appeal to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if 
such sanctions are imposed. The official asked not to be 
identified.

<F P=106> [Comments by International Trade and Industry Minister </F>
Hiroshi Kumagai during a panel debate moderated by political 
commentator Soichiro Tawara; from the "Sunday Project" program 
-- via satellite hookup] 
  [Excerpts] [Kumagai, commenting on the issue of numerical 
targets in the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks] I would 
like to refute [Keio University] Professor Takenaka's assertion 
that Japan has not proposed an alternative to the numerical 
targets put forward by the United States. The fact is that, 
based on actual trade results, Japan has proposed concrete 
measures to help promote the access of U.S. firms to Japanese 
markets. There is a discord between Japan and the United States 
over the U.S. call for Japan to indicate market share targets 
for U.S. companies in Japanese markets modeled on agreements 
reached in the semiconductor talks. As Professor Takenaka 
pointed out, the call will lead to managed trade. The Hosokawa 
cabinet believes that, because the roles of the government and 
private sectors have changed, the past tactics of the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry should be scrapped. Based on 
this principle, the government has proposed concrete measures to 
help U.S. and Japanese companies in their business activities. 
The concrete measures include a plan to set up a joint 
Japanese-U.S. committee to study the reasons behind stagnant 
U.S. exports to Japan by examining the trade results of each 
country. For example, the United States has called on the 
subsidiaries of Japanese automakers in the United States to 
increase their procurement of U.S.-made parts. If they are 
going to buy more, U.S. parts makers have to improve the quality 
of their products. To do this, both sides should submit their 
plans under the so-called design-in scheme, and discuss the 
design and cost of parts. Specifically, if they are to increase 
Japanese procurement, they need to decide just how long they are 
going to discuss these matters. Unlike government procurement, 
however, private-sector procurement can change and depends on 
the behavior of consumers and industry. The call to set targets 
for procurement by the private sectors ignores this and is 
tantamount to a controlled economy. We cannot accept such a 
call. [passage omitted on remarks by other panelists] 
  [Kumagai, commenting on remarks by U.S. Treasury 
Undersecretary Lawrence Summers that Washington is not demanding 
numerical targets but indicators that monitor Japanese efforts 
to open its markets] Washington is urging that Tokyo accept the 
proposal to set indicators while we have expressed apprehension 
that such indicators might become virtually numerical targets. 
The principle Mr. Summers has just mentioned has been agreed by 
Japan. I believe, therefore, that if we negotiate based on this 
principle and with wisdom, we will certainly be able to 
successfully conclude all trade sector talks, including talks on 
macroeconomic measures, by 10 February. We should and can 
conclude them by that date. As [Kyoto University] Professor 
Kosaka pointed out, neither side can reveal its trump card while 
negotiations are continuing. At the final stage, then, we hope 
to make a political decision which can conclude the trade talks. 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has repeated that the 
government backs the agreement to create new markets, to review 
the roles of government and private sector, and to create a 
society which is open. I hope the two sides will conclude trade 
talks based on these principles. I think Mr. Summers shares 
that view. [passage omitted on comments by other panelists] 
  [Kumagai, commenting on Professor Takenaka's proposal that 
Tokyo take responsibility for its macroeconomic issues and 
Washington withdraw demands for measures that might lead to 
managed trade] Since the first Hosokawa-Clinton talks we have 
discussed macroeconomic issues based on the idea that Japan 
should bear responsibility for the world economy. Japan has 
promoted the discussions, not only to fulfill pledges to the 
United States but to play its due role in the world. With this 
in mind, the government is struggling to implement drastic 
pump-priming measures and control the domestic situation. 
Although the ratio of Japan's current account surplus to its 
GNP was once 3.6 percent, it has dropped to about 3 percent. 
Mindful of this, the government is trying to implement economic 
stimulus measures. If Washington sees Japan's efforts to shore 
up the economy, it will know that the Hosokawa government, has 
tried to meet its responsibilities. It is true that Japan and 
the United States distrust each other. Whether or not the 
distrust is dispelled depends on your political stance. 
  [Kumagai answering Tahara's question as to what measures 
he would propose to dispel distrust between Japan and the United 
States] I think Japan should disclose its outlook for economic 
growth and its stimulus measures. Prime Minister Hosokawa has 
announced his long-term vision for the 20th century. He is now 
trying to compile pump-priming measures, including the fiscal 
1994 budget. I hope Washington will understand that in the 
process of formulating pump-priming measures, many political 
adjustments are needed. 
  [Kumagai commenting on a retracted Hosokawa proposal to 
create a national welfare tax] On 3 September last year, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa, based on an agreement among the ruling 
parties, asked the Tax Commission to draw up drastic tax reform 
measures. In October, the Tax Commission reached a conclusion 
and announced reform measures. At that time, the mass media and 
political circles had hot debates over the reform measures. The 
debates included all questions currently being discussed. I 
mean questions concerning implementing tax cuts to shore up the 
economy and deal with the aging society, balancing income, 
consumption, and asset taxes, and increasing the consumption tax 
to fund large-scale tax cuts. The size of the tax hike and 
reductions were also discussed. Moreover, whether or not to use 
the term "welfare tax" was discussed by the Tax Commission. If 
the Liberal Democratic Party were in power, it would have spent 
about one month discussing the tax reform. But at that time, 
the Hosokawa government had to deal with the Uruguay Round talks 
and the political reform issue. As a result, tax reform 
discussions came to halt. Nevertheless, the ruling parties have 
continued tax reform debates. Also, the government established 
the Economic Affairs Committee to continue the discussions. 
Therefore, from our viewpoint, it was quite natural that the 
idea of creating a welfare tax cropped up during discussions. 
If you review media reports, you will know that the government 
has continued tax reform discussions. But because everybody 
focused on the political reform issue and the government had to 
settle other grave issues in such a short period, it looked as 
if the welfare tax proposal appeared abruptly. 
  [Kumagai answering Tawara's question as to whether he 
supports Hosokawa's plan of adopting a 7 percent welfare tax in 
1997 to fund 6 trillion yen tax cuts] From long-term viewpoints 
and to balance all taxes, I think it is necessary to carry out 
the plan. So I support the plan. 
  [Passage omitted on Kumagai remarks on the need to adopt the 
welfare tax to make tax cuts possible and to deal with the aging 
society] 
  [Kumagai answering Tawara's question as to how the 
government 
intends to handle Hosokawa's tax hike and reduction plans, 
whether it will compromise with the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan (SDPJ) over the plans] It is difficult for me to answer 
the question since I am a member of the government. But I 
support the plans as I said earlier. At any rate, the 
government has to reach a conclusion in two days and the 
conclusion should be agreed upon by all ruling parties. I think 
the agreement among the ruling parties is important. I would 
like to say to the SDPJ that should the Hosokawa cabinet, 
ignoring financial conditions, decide on a plan to implement tax 
cuts without securing revenue sources to fund the cuts, the 
public will totally lose their trust in the cabinet. Therefore, 
the cabinet has to implement tax cuts while securing revenue 
sources. I hope you will understand this. 
  [Kumagai refuting Tawara's criticism that Prime Minister 
Hosokawa retracted so easily his tax reform plans immediately 
after the plans drew criticism] Prime Minister Hosokawa has not 
changed his stance. Although the prime minister has agreed to 
take his tax reform plans back to the drawing board and have the 
representatives of the ruling parties discuss them again, he has 
stated that his stance has not changed. He has asked the 
representatives of the ruling parties to decide on measures to 
fund tax cuts if they agree to implement them. Nonetheless, tax 
reform is a grave issue. In the past, it rocked the LDP-led 
Ohira, Nakasone, and Takeshita cabinets. At one time, about 80 
to 90 percent of LDP members were opposed to the tax reform. 
But I believe the Hosokawa cabinet is strong enough to tide 
over the current difficulties.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
should not let the trade "framework" talks collapse and a 
partial agreement should be sought if necessary, Japan's trade 
minister said Thursday [10 February]. 
  "The U.S. has lately stiffened its attitude to seek numeral 
targets in the talks, because the talks are reaching a crucial 
point," said Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade 
and industry, [MITI] after the day's ad hoc cabinet meeting. 
  Japan, for its part, remains opposed to introducing such 
"numerical" targets to measure progress in opening Japan's 
markets, he said. 
  "But I believe we cannot afford to cancel everything we have 
discussed in the talks," Kumagai said, adding the two countries 
should agree on whatever issues they could. 
  Areas for such partial agreement include simplifying Japan's 
government procurement procedures and increasing private-level 
cooperation programs in the respective automotive industries, he 
suggested. 
  He also said the two countries have discussed in 
working-level negotiations including in the final accord the 
opinions of two sides about the numeral targets. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to 
leave Thursday for Washington to review progress in the 
framework talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Japan's Transport Ministry 
and the U.S. Department of Transportation have agreed to 
cooperate in research on transport-related technology, including 
the magnetically levitated transport system, ministry officials 
said Thursday [10 February]. 
  The officials said the two countries are expected to 
announce 
the contents of the agreement at a summit meeting in Washington 
between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Friday. 
  The agreement covers bilateral exchanges of information in 
17 
areas, including the development of technology to control 
automobile emissions, a system for using integrated circuits to 
examine commuter tickets, and a railway signaling system which 
relies on satellites. 
  The magnetically levitated transport system is seen as a 
possible superfast alternative to conventional road and rail 
transport. The vehicles rely on a magnetic field for propulsion 
along a fixed guideway. 
  The agreement also allows for the exchange of experts in 
these fields, the sources said. 
  The first meeting of experts will be held in early May, they 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Japan is not considering 
economic sanctions against North Korea for its refusal to open 
its nuclear facilities to international inspectors, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Thursday [10 February]. 
  "We are not in a situation to do so," the top government 
spokesman said at a news conference. 
  Touching on the stalled talks between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over Pyongyang's 
suspected nuclear arms development program, Takemura said Tokyo 
will continue its diplomatic efforts to help the negotiations go 
smoothly. 
  Takemura's remarks came in response to a report in the major 
daily YOMIURI SHIMBUN that Japan, the United States and South 
Korea have agreed that United Nations economic sanctions will be 
inevitable if Pyongyang continues to block international 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  The YOMIURI reported that the three countries reached the 
accord in early February at a trilateral working-level meeting 
in New York. 
  It also said Tokyo will start preparing for sanctions, such 
as limiting trade with Pyongyang and halting currency 
remittances there by North Korean residents of Japan. 
  Talks between North Korea and the IAEA, the Vienna-based 
international nuclear watchdog, have been stalemated over 
Pyongyang's rejection of the ieae special inspections. 
  The IAEA is expected to refer the matter to the U.N. 
Security 
Council later this month. 
  Japan's exports to North Korea amounted to some 28.2 billion 
yen in 1992 and imports from that country totaled 32.6 billion 
yen, according to Japanese Government figures.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Thursday [10 February] he believes the time is not 
ripe to impose sanctions on North Korea for its refusal to open 
its nuclear facilities to international inspections. "I don't 
consider measures to that point (are necessary) yet," Hosokawa 
told reporters before leaving for summit talks in the United 
States. 
  While signaling that the North Korean nuclear crisis will 
figure high on the agenda in Friday's talks with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton in Washington, Hosokawa reiterated that Tokyo 
counts on Chinese cooperation in efforts to convince Pyongyang 
to reach a compromise. 
  "We are joining forces with the United Nations and the 
permanent members (of the UN Security Council), and would also 
like to enlist China's cooperation," he said. He said he 
conveyed this request to Chinese President Jiang Zemin during 
the summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Seattle in November. 
  Asked for comment on Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa's 
remarks alleging North Korea has already been armed with nuclear 
weapons, Hosokawa said this does not reflect the government's 
stance. "We don't have such reports on hand," he said. 
  Earlier in the day, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura also said Japan is not considering economic sanctions 
against North Korea. "We are not in a situation to do so," the 
top government spokesman said at a news conference. 
  Takemura said Tokyo will continue its diplomatic efforts to 
help the negotiations go smoothly.

  [Text] Kushiro, Hokkaido, Feb. 10 KYODO -- A Russian 
vessel forced two Japanese fishing boats to undergo inspections 
and one of them has not yet returned, Maritime Safety Agency 
officials said Thursday [10 February]. 
  The Russian vessel, apparently a patrol boat, forced the 
83rd 
Kintoku Maru and the 18th Tenyu Maru to stop on Wednesday 
morning as they were sailing in waters 20 kilometers south of 
Etorofu, one of the four disputed islands held by Russia. The 
two trawlers were taken to Shikotan, also one of the four 
Russian-held and Japanese-claimed islands, and underwent 
inspection by Russian authorities, they said. 
  The Tenyu Maru with a crew of 16, based in Ishinomaki, 
Miyagi 
Prefecture, was released later that day and returned to Kushiro 
on Thursday morning but the whereabouts of the Kintoku Maru also 
with 16 crew members from Kushiro is still not known, the 
officials said. The Kintoku Maru and its crew are believed to 
be detained there, the officials said. 
  The two vessels had been engaged in fishing operations south 
of the Kuril chain of islands under a fishing agreement between 
Japan and Russia. Disputes over sovereignty of the four islands 
-- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai groups of islets 
-- have marred relations between the two countries.

[10 February] approved a third supplementary budget for fiscal 
1993, featuring a spending increase of 2,185.2 billion yen over 
the second revised budget to finance the latest pump-priming 
package. The third extra budget, endorsed at a cabinet meeting 
for introduction to the Diet next Tuesday, lifts the scale of 
the entire general-account budget for the current year ending in 
March to 77,437.50 billion yen. 
  The initial fiscal 1993 budget earmarked 72,354.8 billion 
yen. 
  Spending for public works projects was revised upward by 
1,920.1 billion yen to cover a larger part of the largest-ever 
15.25 trillion yen package released by the government Tuesday to 
turn around the ailing economy. 
  The extra budget also calls for additional outlays of 82.1 
billion yen to help salvage struggling small companies. 
  A sum of 143.8 billion yen was additionally budgeted to make 
up for possible losses among farmers after Japan opens its rice 
market. 
  On the other hand, 10.8 billion yen was cut off the planned 
expenditures. 
  The spending increases under the extra budget will be 
financed by 2,182 billion yen in proceeds from construction bond 
issuance and 3.2 billion yen in nontax revenues. 
  The cabinet also approved an increase of 844.9 billion yen 
under the government's fiscal investment and loan program for 
fiscal 1993.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance 
(MOF) announced Thursday [10 February] its belt-tightening draft 
fiscal 1994 budget totaling 73,081.7 billion yen, up 1.0 percent 
from the initial fiscal 1993 budget. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii presented the draft at an 
evening cabinet meeting. 
  The Finance Ministry will immediately begin negotiations 
with 
other ministries and agencies on their allocation requests to 
complete a government budget bill next Tuesday. 
  The growth rate is higher than the 0.2 percent rise in the 
fiscal 1993 initial budget, but technical accounting methods 
such as suspending transfers and moving up redemptions have been 
used to inflate revenues and squeeze outlays. Without these 
measures, the draft budget would have posted a year-to-year 
contraction, officials said. 
  The general operating expenditures -- public works, defense 
and other core outlays -- totaled 40,854.8 billion yen, up 2.3 
percent to post the lowest growth since a 1.2 percent rise in 
the initial fiscal 1988 budget. 
  Of the core spending, public works-related outlays come to 
8,984.6 billion yen, up 4.0 percent, maintaining a relatively 
high growth rate. 
  Defense spending is up 0.8 percent to 4,678.8 billion yen 
and 
official development assistance (ODA) is about 4 percent higher 
at 1,055 billion yen. 
  As for other outlays, the ministry earmarked 14,360.2 
billion 
yen for debt-servicing costs, down 7.0 percent, 12,757.8 billion 
yen for tax allocations to local governments, down 18.3 percent, 
and an unchanged 1,300 billion yen for various purposes using 
accumulated revenues from sales of shares of the privatized 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). 
  The ministry also wants to return 1,544.8 billion yen 
borrowed from the national debt consolidation fund in fiscal 
1992 to cover a revenue shortfall. 
  On the revenue side, the draft budget estimates 53,665.0 
billion yen in tax revenues, down 12.5 percent, due largely to 
cuts of some 4,377.0 billion yen in income tax and other taxes. 
  Nontax revenues are expected to rise 104.8 percent to 
5,601.2 
billion yen, stemming from advanced loan redemptions, and income 
from sales of NTT shares is estimated at 172.5 billion yen, down 
7.5 percent. 
  The ministry is to issue a record 13,643.0 billion yen in 
government bonds, up 67.8 percent, comprising 10,509.2 billion 
yen in construction bonds to be used primarily for public works 
and 3,133.8 billion yen in deficit-covering bonds for financing 
the tax cuts. As a result, the dependence on public borrowings 
comes to 18.7 percent of the budget, up from 11.2 percent in 
fiscal 1993, and the outstanding balance of bonds tops 200 
trillion yen for the first time to reach about 201 trillion yen, 
up from an estimated 182 trillion for the current year.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry's 
draft budget for fiscal 1994, submitted to the cabinet Thursday 
[10 February], earmarks some 1.05 trillion yen for official 
development assistance (ODA), up by a record low of about 4.0 
percent from the initial fiscal 1993 budget. 
  The coalition cabinet headed by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa is scheduled to decide on the government's budget 
proposal on Tuesday and submit it to the Diet for approval. 
  In the meantime, the Finance Ministry will hold last-minute 
negotiating sessions with other ministries and agencies on 
possible minor revisions. 
  But government sources said the ODA element is not expected 
to rise any higher than 4.6 percent in the budget for fiscal 
1994, which starts April 1. 
  The rate of increase in the ministry's draft ODA budget, 
which compares with the previous fiscal year's 6.5 percent hike, 
is the lowest ever, undercutting a 5.8 percent boost in fiscal 
1987. It is the fourth consecutive decrease since an 8.2 
percent hike in fiscal 1990. 
  Ministry officials attributed the low rate of increase to 
severe fiscal constraints. They said it reflects efforts to 
strike a balance with the rest of the government's general 
account budget, in which a mere 1.0 percent increase was 
proposed, the lowest rate in seven years. 
  But they pointed out that the low rate of growth would be 
significantly offset in dollar terms by the high yen. Fiscal 
1993's proposed ODA budget was calculated at the rate of 122 yen 
to the dollar, while this year's was figured at 106 yen, they 
said. 
  The Foreign Ministry had sought a 7.9 percent increase in 
August for its own aid budget for fiscal 1994, but the Finance 
Ministry proposed a mere 0.9 percent rise. In fiscal 1993 the 
Foreign Ministry accounted for roughly half Japan's overall 1.01 
trillion yen ODA budget. 
  Finance Ministry officials said the proposed budget 
maintains 
the overall line of Japan's ODA program, while greatly expanding 
funding for projects that can be implemented at the grass roots 
level. 
  To that end, officials noted that the ministry proposed a 50 
percent increase in small-scale project grant assistance and a 
22.7 percent increase in support for nongovernmental 
organizations engaged in development and humanitarian efforts 
overseas. 
  But although 1.5 billion yen is devoted in the budget 
proposal to small-scale project assistance worldwide, it is less 
than other proposed ODA expenditures such as an allocation of 
1.9 billion yen to build an "international center" on Japan's 
northernmost main island of Hokkaido. 
  The ministry proposes a 10 percent decrease in Japan's 
contributions to international organizations, down from fiscal 
1993's 147.7 billion yen to 132.9 billion yen. 
  But it allocates 54.9 percent more funding for environmental 
conservation activities coordinated by the United Nations. 
  The budget proposal called for a 1.1 percent increase in 
bilateral grant aid from 243.1 billion yen to 245.8 billion yen, 
while recommending that bilateral technical assistance should 
grow by 4.9 percent from 210.2 billion yen to 220.4 billion yen. 
  The most massive increase in the proposed budget is in 
development aid for Palestinians, a 300 percent hike to 100 
million dollars, reflecting progress made in recent Middle East 
peace negotiations.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The following are the main 
points of the fiscal 1994 budget proposed Thursday by the 
Finance Ministry. 
  -- The budget allocates a mere 1.0 percent rise in the 
general accounts from the initial fiscal 1993 budget. Without 
technical accounting factors, the budget will post the first 
year-to-year contraction in 39 years. 
  -- The Finance Ministry plans to issue deficit-coverning 
bonds for the first time in five years to make up for revenue 
shortfalls stemming mainly from 6 trillion yen tax cuts. The 
ministry also plans to issue more construction bonds. As a 
result, the ratio of dependence on public borrowings rises to 
18.7 percent from 11.2 percent in fiscal 1993. 
  -- The general operating expenditures will rise only 2.3 
percent but public works-related outlays will rise a relatively 
high 4.0 percent. 
  -- Defense spending is up 0.8 percent for the lowest rise 
since fiscal 1960 and official development assistance (ODA) will 
rise 4.0 percent. 
  -- The draft fiscal investment and loan program allocates 
7.0 
percent higher outlays to finance housing, public works and 
other projects.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry 
proposed to the cabinet on Thursday [10 February] a fiscal 1994 
defense budget of 4,678.8 billion yen, up 0.8 percent over the 
initial fiscal 1993 budget and the smallest increase in 34 years. 
  In line with Japan's 1990-1995 defense buildup plan, the 
ministry set aside 882 billion yen to acquire frontline weapons, 
such as four F-15 jet fighters and two Boeing E-767 airborne 
warning and control system (AWACS) planes, ministry officials 
said. 
  The figure represented a 0.2 percent rise over fiscal 1993. 
Of the contract-based figure, 24.1 billion yen will be used as 
a down payment, with the remaining 857.9 billion yen payment to 
be deferred in coming years, the officials said. 
  Pressed by sagging state revenues, the ministry "did its 
utmost efforts to curb the Defense Agency-requested increases in 
frontline weaponry in view of the generally favorable 
international situation and the very serious fiscal conditions," 
an official said. 
  The agency initially requested an overall defense outlay of 
4,734.5 billion yen for the fiscal year starting April 1, up 
1.95 percent over fiscal 1993 that ends on March 31. 
  Despite a recent government proposal to trim levels of 
defense outlays in coming years, the ministry is aware of "the 
need to prevent possible policy decisions from dashing the 
possibility of future defense outlay increases," an official 
said. He was referring to Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa's 
suggestion last year to review the level of defense spending and 
consider defense budget cuts. 
  In view of that, the ministry sanctioned a Defense Agency 
request to purchase an antimissile Patriot interceptor system 
and a sophisticated computer system to enhance the intercepting 
capability of the Japanese military's armory of Patriot missiles 
to counter a threat from North Korea's "Nodong-1" missiles, they 
said. 
  The Patriot missile system, including a radar and flight 
control system, will cost 33.5 billion yen, while the computer 
and computer software will cost 8.7 billion yen, they said. 
  The computer system will enhance the capability of two of 
Japan's 26 Patriot missile firing units to the level of the 
"PAC-2" Patriots, which were used by U.S. troops during the 1991 
Gulf War to repel Iraqi Scud missiles, they said. 
  One firing unit comprises four missiles and five launchers. 
  The Defense Agency has been pushing for purchases of an 
improved version of the Patriots to counter the threat of North 
Korea's missiles, which the 1993 Defense White Paper warned 
"will be able to reach most Japanese territory if Pyongyang 
deploys it to specific areas." 
  The draft defense budget accounts for 0.947 percent of 
Japan's estimated gross national product (GNP) for fiscal 1994. 
  The ministry boosted its allocations to help U.S. Forces in 
Japan. The figure was increased from 400.9 billion yen in 
fiscal 1993 to "more than 425 billion yen" in fiscal 1994, said 
Hirofumi Gomi, a senior official who helped draft the budget. 
  Of the 425 billion yen, the ministry allocated 123.4 billion 
yen toward "75 percent" of total labor costs of the some 22,000 
Japanese employees working at U.S. bases in Japan, utilities and 
other costs, he said. 
  The spending is mandated under the 1960 Japan-U.S. Security 
Pact and the 1991 pact known as the Special Measures Agreement. 
The outlays are meant to cement the security solidarity of the 
two allies.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry 
unveiled a tightened draft budget for fiscal 1994, projecting a 
mere 1.0 percent growth, but virtually shrinking from the 
initial fiscal 1993 budget. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii presented the draft, 
totaling 
73,081.7 billion yen, at an evening cabinet meeting and just in 
time for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's meeting with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton in Washington on Friday [11 February]. 
But Hosokawa may face difficulties in garnering U.S. support as 
the ministry barely managed to maintain only a small growth. 
  The growth rate is higher than the 0.2 percent rise in the 
fiscal 1993 initial budget after expenditures worth some 4,520 
billion yen were squeezed through special accounting techniques. 
Those measures included suspending 3,084.9 billion yen in 
transfers to the debt-servicing account. 
  Without such measures to cope with expected low tax revenues 
from the prolonged economic slump and planned income tax cuts, 
the draft budget would have posted a year-to-year contraction, a 
senior ministry official told reporters. 
  The austerity is more clearly seen in the general operating 
expenditures -- the core of a state budget including public 
works, defense, overseas assistance and other key outlays. Such 
spending totaled 40,854.8 billion yen, up only 2.3 percent to 
post the lowest growth since a 1.2 percent rise in the initial 
budget for fiscal 1988 -- a year before Japan last issued 
deficit-financing bonds. 
  Citing relatively strong spending in public works to lift 
the 
economy, Fujii told reporters that Japan could "win U.S. 
support" with the budget along with a third supplementary budget 
for fiscal 1993 budget, endorsed at the same cabinet meeting, 
and a record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package launched 
Tuesday. 
  Public works-related outlays came to 8,984.6 billion yen, up 
4.0 percent for the third straight year. 
  A key principle stressed in the budget draft is to "consider 
the economy as much as possible" to move it toward "a 
full-fledged recovery phase as soon as possible in fiscal 1994 
and on to stable growth in and after fiscal 1995." But "to 
limit issuance of special (deficit-covering) bonds that leads to 
uncontrolled deterioration of financial structure, (the 
ministry) is making efforts to intensively and effectively 
distribute funds amid limited financial sources while more 
thoroughly reviewing expenditures," the draft says. 
  Amid a global trend of military cutbacks, the draft's 
principle is clearly reflected in defense spending worth 4,678.8 
billion yen, up a scant 0.8 percent to mark the lowest growth in 
34 years. 
  Outlays for official development assistance (ODA) were 
limited to 1,055.0 billion yen, up 4.0 percent. The growth is 
lower than fiscal 1993's 6.5 percent, but the ministry official 
said the total amount would be substantially higher in dollar 
terms after the yen's sharp appreciation over the past year. 
  The draft estimates 53,665.0 billion yen for tax revenues -- 
the key income source -- down 12.5 percent for the second 
consecutive year of lower projections. 
  Even if 4,377.0 billion yen in tax cuts are excluded, 
estimated revenues are 3,366.0 billion yen lower than the 
initial forecast in fiscal 1993. 
  Nontax revenues are expected to rise 104.8 percent to 
5,601.2 
billion yen, inflated irregularly through advanced loan 
redemptions, and income from sales of the privatized Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) shares is estimated at 172.5 
billion yen, down 7.5 percent. 
  The special measures taken to raise revenues and squeeze 
expenditures are thus leading to the limiting of allocations for 
operating outlays. Given this situation, the ministry is to 
issue a record 13,643.0 billion yen in government bonds, 
consisting of 10,509.2 billion yen in construction bonds to be 
used primarily for public works and 3,133.8 billion yen in 
deficit-covering bonds to finance the tax cuts. 
  As a result, the bond revenue dependence comes to 18.7 
percent of the budget, up from 11.2 percent in fiscal 1993 and 
the highest since 19.4 percent in fiscal 1987. The outstanding 
balance of bonds tops 200 trillion yen for the first time to 
reach about 201 trillion yen, up from an estimated 182 trillion 
yen for the current year. 
  The ministry official expressed strong concern that a 
further 
rise in the bond balance would block the core spendings, and he 
called for a tax reform by the year-end as the government and 
the ruling coalition have promised. 
  Fujii said the government will make efforts to repay the 
bonds to win public support. 
  The ministry also wants to return 1,544.8 billion yen 
borrowed from the national debt consolidation fund in fiscal 
1992 to cover a revenue shortfall. 
  As for other spendings, the ministry earmarked 14,360.2 
billion yen for debt-servicing costs, down 7.0 percent, 12,757.8 
billion yen for tax allocations to local governments, down 18.3 
percent, and an unchanged 1,300 billion yen for various purposes 
using revenues from NTT share sales. 
  Other ministries and agencies will now begin renegotiations 
with the Finance Ministry to complete a government budget bill 
by next Tuesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Some Japanese business 
leaders Thursday [10 February] criticized the 73.08 trillion yen 
draft budget unveiled by the Finance Ministry. 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said it contains few new 
elements. The draft should have included more of the original 
policy objectives of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, 
especially in seeking a higher quality of living for Japanese, 
he said. 
  Nagano suggested that spending should have been expanded to 
reform the nation's industrial structure, such as providing 
appropriations for agriculture. 
  Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of 
Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said drastic cuts in expenditures 
should be sought through a complete review of outlays for 
individual ministries and agencies. 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, urged the government to strictly check expenditures in 
implementing the budget. But Inaba welcomed an increase of more 
than 4 percent in the proposed public works spending for its 
economic stimulation effects.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Top policy-makers of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party 
(JCP) on Thursday [10 February] criticized the 73.08 trillion 
yen draft budget compiled and made public by the Finance 
Ministry. 
  Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP Policy Affairs 
Research Council, said the draft shows that the issue of a 
budget for construction of new bullet train lines and other 
difficult problems has been sidestepped and left unsettled. The 
chief LDP policy-maker said his party will press the government 
in the Diet to meet its budget demands. 
  Noriaki Sasaki, chairman of the JCP Economic Policy 
Committee, said it is unacceptable that the budget limits income 
tax cuts to one year. He said the draft shows that if income 
tax cuts are to be on a permanent basis, there would have to be 
a major raise in the consumption tax rate and such an increase 
is quite unacceptable.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry 
issued a draft fiscal investment and loan program for fiscal 
1994 Thursday [10 February] that earmarks higher outlays to 
revive the sagging economy and upgrade living standards. 
  Ordinary "zaito" investment programs mainly to finance 
housing projects, public works and projects by 
government-affiliated financial institutions are allocated 
39,147.9 billion yen for the year starting April 1, up 7.0 
percent from the original fiscal 1993 zaito budget. 
  The ministry budgeted 10,186.5 billion yen for 
housing-related projects, an investment category believed to 
underpin the Japanese economy amid the long slump, up a sharp 
22.6 percent. In fiscal 1993, such spending growth was set at 
10.4 percent. 
  Outlays of 5,979.0 billion yen, up 10.1 percent, go to 
lending and other programs for struggling small companies, the 
ministry said. 
  It allots 7,949.4 billion yen, up 12.2 percent, to local 
public organizations and local public financial institutions as 
a way to improve livelihood-related infrastructure in regional 
areas. 
  The 7.0 percent growth in ordinary zaito programs compares 
with a 13.4 percent gain in fiscal 1993 and a 10.8 percent rise 
in fiscal 1992. 
  But including 994.9 billion yen in fiscal investment newly 
secured under the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, 
the sum will total 40,142.8 billion yen for a growth of 10 
percent. 
  The extra budget to fund the government's record 15.25 
trillion yen pump-priming package, released Tuesday, was adopted 
Thursday. 
  Next year's zaito program should have maximum effects when 
combined with the extra zaito program for the current year, a 
ministry official told a press conference. The concept reflects 
the need to ensure continued budgetary implementation for 15 
months from January 1994, he said. 
  The official said the ministry set out an economy-boosting 
zaito program for the fourth consecutive year. 
  It appropriated a 5.1 percent increase to 48,097.9 billion 
yen for overall zaito investment, or a sum including programs 
managed by the ministry's Trust Fund Bureau. The growth 
compares with a 12.2 percent gain in fiscal 1993. 
  The draft for the fiscal investment and loan program, often 
called the second national budget, was shown to ministries and 
agencies concerned after getting the cabinet's approval Thursday 
afternoon. 
  Of the housing-related budget, the ministry set aside 
8,763.2 
billion yen for the Housing Loan Corp., up 26.9 percent. Under 
this program the corporation would, for example, raise its basic 
lending amount for an individual home purchaser by 200,000 yen 
to 8 million yen. 
  Housing investment for fiscal 1994 accounted for the 
highest-ever 33.4 percent of the total ordinary zaito program, 
eclipsing the preceding record rate of 32.6 percent in fiscal 
1991. 
  Loan programs for small companies include an 8.3 percent 
gain 
to 4,089 billion yen by the People's Finance Corp. and a 9.4 
percent growth to 2,852.5 billion yen by the Japan Finance Corp. 
for small business. 
  The ministry earmarks 156.0 billion yen in loans to 
manufacturers striving to launch new businesses under 
restructuring efforts, up 15.6 percent. 
  The zaito program secured a lending quota of 620 billion yen 
for the Japan Development Bank for urban infrastructure 
improvement projects, up 9.9 percent, and a quota of 277 billion 
yen for the same bank for information and telecommunications 
infrastructure, up 20.4 percent. 
  Outlays of 6.5 trillion yen for local public organizations, 
up 14.0 percent, are intended to upgrade sewerage, disposal and 
health facilities. 
  The ministry increased by 26.0 percent to 325 billion yen 
the 
allocation for lending by the Export-Import Bank of Japan as a 
way to expand Japan's exports of manufactured goods. 
  The official said fiscal investment and loan programs for 
livelihood, culture and small business-related areas represented 
a record 72.9 percent of the total ordinary zaito program, up 
from last year's 68.8 percent and the previous high of 71.4 
percent in fiscal 1991. 
  The zaito program does not include stock investment under 
new 
"shiteitan" accounts, a portfolio with no investment limits on 
stocks, the official said. New shiteitans were created in 1992 
as a means of spurring the sluggish stock market. 
  Whether or not new shiteitan will be financed in the fiscal 
1994 zaito has yet to be decided, the official said. 
  The draft is scheduled to be formalized by the government 
next Tuesday after negotiations between the Finance Ministry and 
other ministries and agencies seeking restoration of budget 
allocations the ministry deleted from their original requests.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will 
start negotiations Friday [11 February] with other government 
ministries and agencies seeking a restoration of their budget 
requests for fiscal 1994, ministry officials said Thursday. 
  The Finance Ministry unveiled earlier Thursday a tightened 
73.08 trillion yen draft budget for the year beginning April 1, 
projecting a mere 1.0 percent growth but virtually shrinking 
from the initial fiscal 1993 budget. 
  The ministry seeks to complete a government budget bill by 
next Tuesday following the negotiations. 
  The officials said the negotiations will focus on public 
works spending, for which 100 billion was reserved for possible 
reinstatement. A total of 200 billion yen was set aside for 
restoration in the whole budget. 
  The talks will also center on the defense and official 
development assistance (ODA) budgets, the officials said. 
  The proposed defense budget was up a scant 0.8 percent to 
mark the lowest growth in 34 years, while the ODA budget was up 
4.0 percent, the lowest increase on record.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's former special adviser said Thursday [10 February] 
the premier made a serious mistake as a reformist in the process 
that led to his proposed 7 percent new indirect tax that was 
later revoked. Shusei Tanaka said, "Hosokawa's proposal was 
scrapped in a jiffy because the government skipped an important 
process for a reformist cabinet and only followed the pace of 
administrative needs." 
  In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Tanaka said "the 
government cannot get support from people on (the tax system) 
unless it makes achievements in the ongoing administrative 
reform and rectifies the inequitable tax system." 
  "The premier had stressed that radical administrative reform 
and rectification of the inequitable tax system are 
prerequisites before implementing (full-scale) tax reform and he 
still hopes to do that," Tanaka said. 
  But Hosokawa's intention was not manifested and instead he 
pushed forward with the idea to implement income tax cuts as 
well as a "national welfare" tax, he said. 
  "The role of a reform-oriented administration is to change 
the outmoded social systems, that is to say, to change 
political, administrative and economic systems and to establish 
a new 'stage setting' for a new era," he said. 
  Tanaka stepped down as special adviser to Hosokawa on 
January 
31 shortly after the Diet enacted a set of four political reform 
bills, saying his job of helping to enact political reform was 
done. 
  He is currently acting leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), a 
small coalition component headed by Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura. 
  In an early morning news conference on February 3, Hosokawa 
unveiled a "national welfare tax," a 7 percent levy on almost 
all goods and services, that was to take effect in April 1997, 
replacing the current 3 percent consumption tax. 
  The new revenues were partly aimed at financing a 6 trillion 
yen income tax reduction. 
  The proposal, however, provoked fierce opposition from the 
leading coalition bloc, the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] 
(SDP) [SDSPJ], which threatened to leave the alliance unless the 
new tax proposal was dropped. 
  Hosokawa's decision to implement the tax measures was done 
without the consent of the SDPJ, the largest of the seven-party 
coalition. 
  The coalition parties revoked Hosokawa's proposal the 
following day and struck a deal to implement the 6 trillion yen 
tax cut in advance of formulating other measures to secure the 
lost revenue.

cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has fallen to 59.2 
percent this week from 62.8 percent in December, a KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE poll showed Thursday [10 February]. 
  It was the lowest since Hosokawa formed the coalition 
cabinet 
last August. 
  The KYODO poll, taken Tuesday and Wednesday, also indicated 
that those who do not support the Hosokawa cabinet came to 29.7 
percent, up 5.3 percentage points. 
  Of those polled, 54.5 percent said they opposed the proposed 
"national welfare tax," which Hosokawa presented on February 3. 
The proposal was later revoked.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
decided Thursday [10 February] to issue 3.14 trillion yen in 
deficit-covering bonds in coming fiscal 1994 to finance income 
and other tax cuts. 
  The decision came in the government's budget formation 
policy 
endorsed at a morning cabinet meeting. 
  Bond issuance will total 13.64 trillion yen, constituting 
the 
deficit bonds and 10.50 trillion yen in construction bonds for 
financing public works. 
  Also to be issued are 2.75 trillion yen worth of government- 
guaranteed bonds by public corporations. 
  Meanwhile, the government also decided to return funds to 
general accounts from the debt consolidation fund in fiscal 1994 
to cover a shortfall in revenue. 
  As for general budget policy, the government, stressing the 
tough budget situation, called for effective allocation to lift 
the economy. 
  "Tax revenues dropped for the second straight year in fiscal 
1994, resulting in budget shortfall of some 1.5 trillion yen, 
and the tax revenue trend since then is expected to remain 
extremely tough," the policy statement said. 
  But Japan's economy remains "broadly sluggish" and the 
government must take economic management that "ensures a 
full-fledged recovery as early as possible in fiscal 1994 and a 
stable growth in and after fiscal 1995," it said. 
  Against this backdrop, the government is to put the emphasis 
"as much as possible on the economy" in the fiscal 1994 budget, 
fiscal investment and loans program and third fiscal 1993 extra 
budget. 
  Funds must be distributed "intensively and effectively under 
limited financial resources," but a "thorough review" of 
expenditures must be taken to limit issuance of deficit-covering 
bonds. 
  Given the government policy, the Finance Ministry is to 
compile and announce its draft for the fiscal 1994 budget, the 
fiscal program and the third extra budget in the evening.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Japanese banks posted a 
record low year-to-year growth rate in January of 0.5 percent in 
the average balance of lending, reflecting weak demand for funds 
amid the sluggish economy, the Bank of Japan said Thursday [10 
February]. 
  The balance stood at 525.4 trillion yen at the end of 
January, the central bank said. 
  The banks involved are 11 major commercial banks, 64 
regional 
banks, 65 second-tier regional banks, three long-term credit 
banks and seven trusts banks. 
  It was the third consecutive month in which the lending 
growth rate has hit a new low. 
  Major commercial banks in particular made an effort to step 
up lending, said a Bank of Japan official. 
  "But with fund demand generally frail, there was too much 
competition to get a piece of the pie and the lending situation 
basically stayed the same," he said. 
  "I don't think lending will drop in the future, but it 
probably won't increase for a while either," he said. 
  The balance of lending by the major commercial banks, known 
as city banks in Japan, rose 0.4 percent, while that of 
long-term credit banks grew 0.1 percent. 
  Regional banks saw a 1.8 percent rise, and second-tier 
regional banks posted a 0.4 percent increase. But trust banks 
saw a decline for the fourth straight month, dropping 1.7 
percent -- the biggest fall on record. 
  Trust banks are probably suffering from the lack of 
popularity of their mainstay variable-interest loans whose rates 
are decided by the long-term prime rate, the central bank 
official said. 
  Foreign banks saw a decline for the second straight month, 
but the drop by 14.7 percent was smaller than the 15.5 percent 
decline in December.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- The Japanese Government and 
the ruling coalition have decided to abolish the current system 
of imposing taxes on companies buying their own shares and 
writing them off, officials said Wednesday [9 February]. 
  Under the current system, a per-share capital increase 
resulting from a company's purchases of its own shares for 
write-offs is regarded as a taxable dividend. 
  The business community and securities companies have been 
calling for abolition of the tax to make it easier for companies 
to buy their own shares. 
  The officials said the system will be abolished under a 
fiscal 1994 tax reform program and in connection with the 
scheduled year-end lifting of restrictions on companies buying 
their own shares.

  [Text] Nagoya, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Prosecutors indicted Diet 
member Tadao Otani on Thursday [10 February] on a charge of 
helping his supporters obtain tax refunds by falsifying receipts 
and income reports. 
  Otani, 58, formerly of the ruling coalition party Shinseito 
and now an independent member of the House of Representatives, 
allegedly conspired with his former political secretary Susumu 
Ochiai, 51. 
  The indictment came after police sent their case to the 
Nagoya District Public Prosecutors Office earlier in the day. 
  The two men submitted false reports to the Aichi Prefectural 
Election Administration Committee, from 1990 through 1992, 
saying that Otani's support groups had received political 
donations from 72 supporters for which, according to the 
indictment, they issued false receipts. Otani's supporters then 
claimed unlawful income tax refunds totaling 55 million yen, 
prosecutors said. 
  Otani also evaded 1.2 million yen in tax during the 1990 to 
1992 period by falsely reporting that he had donated 3 million 
yen to one of the groups. 
  In a separate allegation, Ochiai submitted false reports 
during that same period claiming that support groups had 
received donations from 47 supporters to whom he issued 
receipts, but later refunded a total of 38 million yen, 
prosecutors said. 
  The supporters apparently each claimed tax refunds of 
several 
hundred thousand yen by reporting to tax offices false donations 
of 1 million yen to 1.5 million yen. 
  Private donations by individuals to politicians are exempt 
from income tax. 
  Prosecutors indicted Otani without arrest on charges of 
violating the Political Funds Control Law and the Income Tax 
Law. It is the first time a Diet member has been charged with 
such a tax refund scam, prosecutors said. 
  Otani has denied his involvement, stating Ochiai acted on 
his 
own discretion. 
  At the time of the alleged violations, Otani was an Aichi 
Prefectural Assembly member of the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP). Otani was elected in July last year as a lower house 
member of Shinseito, an LDP offshoot. He left Shinseito last 
month to serve as an independent member of the lower house. 
  Ochiai, indicted in December on charges of violating the 
Income Tax Law in the case, pleaded guilty in his trial last 
month. Ochiai was also indicted Thursday on charges of 
violating the Political Funds Control Law.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tadashi Sekizawa, chairman of the </F>
Communication Industries Association of Japan and president of 
Fujitsu Ltd., by economic news reporter Haruyuki Aikawa; last in 
three-part series of interviews with key industrial leaders in 
priority sectors under negotiation at the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, entitled: "The Japan-U.S. Economic Framework 
Talks: My Arguments"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Aikawa] What is your impression of the framework 
talks? [Sekizawa] The United States is seeking to set a share 
for U.S.-made products on the Japanese market at the same level 
as those secured by American manufacturers in the seven major 
industrialized nations (G-7), except Japan. So it is a 
numerical target, and it means managed trade. 
  [Aikawa] You must have had a bitter experience in agreeing 
to the semiconductor accord. 
  [Sekizawa] All member companies of the Communication 
Industries Association of Japan [CIAJ] are semiconductor users, 
and an overwhelming number of them are semiconductor makers too. 
To attain "the 20-percent share of foreign-made 
semiconductors," efforts such as starting cooperation right from 
the semiconductor development stage have been made." 
  The 20-percent share is neither a commitment nor a target. 
Actually, it is taken as a point at issue. The United States 
appears to think the semiconductor accord is the only successful 
case. If a numerical target should be included in the accord on 
the telecommunications sector, it is certain that the United 
States will start trying to strenuously impose it on Japan. We 
have had similar experiences, and that is why we are worried. 
  [Aikawa] The United States maintains that foreign-made 
products have only a small share on the Japanese market. What 
is your comment on this? 
  [Sekizawa] The share mentioned by the United States is at 
the same level as that of other G-7 nations, but the share of 
the private sector is included in the figure. According to a 
CIAJ survey, the share of foreign-made products in government 
procurement is 0.3 percent in the United States, and 1.6 percent 
in Japan. The figure is small in both countries but the share 
in Japan is larger than that in the United States. Therefore, 
the argument maintained by the United States is based on shaky 
ground. 
  [Aikawa] The United States also calls for including Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corporation [NTT] in the list of 
organizations required to procure more foreign-made products. 
  [Sekizawa] Since the years when NTT was a public corporation 
it has made efforts to keep procurement fair by treating both 
Japanese and foreign companies without discrimination, and it 
has procured products from American and European makers. When 
the United States says "our companies are not included," we are 
puzzled. Moreover, NTT has been turned into a private company. 
The question is whether the same system connected with the 
government can be applied to NTT. The question also arises when 
this issue is viewed from the standpoint of protecting 
stockholders' interests. 
  [Aikawa] Why is it that the share of foreign-made products 
in government procurement is small? 
  [Sekizawa] In conducting government procurement, neither 
Japan nor the United States will invite all foreign companies to 
participate in the bidding. Moreover, another problem concerns 
specifications, which are normally written in English in the 
United States and in Japanese in Japan. According to standards 
set at the GATT, however, I think efforts should be made to make 
procurement procedures transparent. As a result, the amount of 
office work on procurement will increase. Since costs will be 
paid by taxes, the people will be asked to bear this new burden. 
  [Aikawa] What do you think of the principle of mutualism? 
  [Sekizawa] NTT holds business talks in the United States to 
expand its procurement of foreign-made products. Although the 
United States is not being asked to make the same effort, a 
major precondition lies in the U.S. Government at least taking 
similar measures in conducting its government procurement. 
  [Aikawa] Cooperation is being promoted among many companies 
in the communications industry. What do you think of this? 
  [Sekizawa] This sector is becoming more global and 
borderless. Cooperation is being promoted among companies of 
various nations in different ways. The question is whether 
there is any sense in deciding on the share for each country, as 
this may have the adverse effect of obstructing the trend toward 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Vicious Propaganda Aimed at </F>
Justifying Nuclear Armament and Overseas Aggression"] 
  [Text] In an interview with Fuji Television on 6 February, 
Ichiro Ozawa, representative of the Japan Renewal Party, made 
absurd remarks libeling and slandering our Republic. He talked 
about our Republic's nuclear armament, and stressed that Japan 
must examine countermeasures to cope with an emergency situation 
on the Korean peninsula, saying that if North Korea takes a 
military action, it is a big problem. 
  We can never overlook the fact that this fellow, who is 
known 
as an influential person in Japanese political circles, has 
created a spirit of hostility against us, thus libeling us. 
  The absurd remarks by Ozawa are an open challenge to our 
Republic's dignity and authority and, also, show as it is the 
indiscriminative madness of the Japanese reactionaries who 
suffer pains because they cannot crush [apsal] our Republic, 
thus being frightened at the might and invincibility of the 
popular mass- centered socialism of our country. 
  Why he made such remarks by picking a quarrel with us is not 
because Japan is actually threatened by someone. Even Yohei 
Kono, president of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, has 
denounced him, saying that his remarks are intended to agitate 
the people by striking terror into their hearts. The Japanese 
reactionaries' systemized bad habit are to achieve their heinous 
goal by persistently sticking to their insistence. 
  Through a shock and strategic propaganda against the 
so-called threat from North Korea, Ozawa has tried to make an 
excuse for the Japanese arms build-up, in particular, for the 
acceleration of its nuclear armament and has also attempted to 
lead the Japanese public opinion to justify its goal. 
  It is well known that Japan's nuclear armament has already 
been in the level of danger. Japan has largely accumulated 
plutonium to use for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and has 
continued to increase its nuclear reprocessing capacity. 
  The Swedish paper SVENSKA DAGBLADET has recently reported 
that Japan possesses everything -- such as plutonium, an 
electronic explosion device, and technicians -- capable of 
immediately producing nuclear weapons, and that it has already 
produced nuclear warheads which can be operated when they are 
filled with plutonium as much as they need. 
  Even the recent papers of the United States, Denmark, and 
Finland reported that based on their documents, the British 
Defense Ministry and U.S. Central Intelligence Agency have 
proven that Japan actually possesses nuclear weapons. Japan's 
nuclear armament and its goal to become a military power, which 
are earnestly pushing ahead with, gravely pose a threat to peace 
and security in the Northeast Asia, including the Korean 
peninsula. Nevertheless, they are talking about a threat from 
someone. These are preposterous remarks. 
  What we cannot overlook is, particularly, the fact that 
Ozawa 
has openly claimed that Japan must examine countermeasures to 
cope with the emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. When 
we remind of his previous remarks that if a war breaks out on 
the Korean peninsula, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces must be 
sent there as a member of the UN forces, it is very clear what 
his real intention is. This means that Japan must prepare for 
taking military action on the presumption that it should 
participate in a war in case it breaks out on Korea. 
  Availing themselves of this opportunity in which the great 
powers' positions have been reduced after the Cold War ends, the 
Japanese rulers attempt to achieve their domination-oriented 
goal by militarily advancing in the Asia-Pacific region. As the 
first target of their overseas military invasion, they have 
selected Korea. It is clear that to make an excuse for their 
aggressive military action, they pick a quarrel with us by 
saying that we can take military action. This is an act similar 
to a thief shouting "stop thief." 
  We cannot but be alert to the reckless remarks and acts of 
Japanese reactionaries, who are unsteady in their mind because 
of their ambitions for nuclear armament and reinvasion. Our 
people will never allow anyone to infringe upon the dignity and 
sovereignty of our Republic. They will resolutely confront 
aggressors. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must know the consequences 
arising 
from their reckless act and act with discretion.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa vowed efforts Thursday [10 February] to bring stalled 
trade talks with the United States to a successful conclusion in 
his meeting Friday with president Bill Clinton in Washington. 
However, Hosokawa offered no clues as to how he will break the 
impasse. 
  He reiterated that Japan cannot accept a U.S. proposal to 
set 
numerical targets to gauge the openness of its markets to 
imports, but said he will strive to reach an accord on bilateral 
trade, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference. 
  He said the premier told a cabinet meeting that the trade 
negotiations are a key to further promoting friendly and 
constructive ties between Japan and the U.S. 
  Hosokawa will fly to Washington later Thursday and hold a 
summit with Clinton on Friday to assess progress in the economic 
negotiations being held under a bilateral trade framework accord 
concluded last July. 
  It will be Hosokawa's third meeting with Clinton since he 
took office last August. They first met in New York in 
September and again in Seattle in November. 
  In his afternoon news conference, Takemura reiterated that 
Tokyo cannot accept the U.S. demand on numerical targets, 
saying, "I don't think we will depart from that principle." 
  On Hata's arrival in Washington, Takemura said the foreign 
minister will do everything he can in a last-ditch effort to 
break the gridlock in the bilateral trade talks before the 
Hosokawa- Clinton summit. 
  Asked about International Trade and Industry Minister 
Hiroshi 
Kumagai's remark suggesting the possibility of a partial 
agreement in the negotiations, the chief government spokesman 
said Tokyo is still trying to reach a comprehensive accord with 
Washington. 
  Japan and the U.S. have been negotiating on three priority 
trade areas -- government procurement of goods and services, 
auto and auto parts trade, and insurance. They remain at odds 
over the U.S. demand that "objective criteria" be set to measure 
how open Japanese markets are to imports.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Zabihollah Now-Forsati, Iranian </F>
ambassador to the ROK, by reporter Pak Kyong-a; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the 
Islamic revolution on 11 February, Zabihollah Now-Forsati (45), 
Iranian ambassador to the ROK, stressed the need to expand 
economic exchanges with the ROK. He said, "in the wake of the 
15th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, Iran is faced with 
the task of revitalizing its economy. The ROK is a very suitable 
economic partner that Iran presently needs." 
  The Islamic government was established in Iran after the 
Islamic revolutionary forces led by late Ayatollah Khomeini 
overthrew the Pahlavi Dynasty in 1979. Iran has been suffering 
economic difficulties that increased with the aftermath of the 
eight-year-long war with Iraq and last year's drop in oil prices. 
  [Pak Kyong-a] Relations between the ROK and Iran were 
estranged for a short time after the Islamic revolution.... 
  [Zabihollah Now-Forsati] Iran and the ROK established 
diplomatic relations in 1962. Their relations became estranged 
to such an extent that the ambassadorship was downgraded to the 
level of charge d'affairs in 1981 when the war was going on 
between Iran and Iraq. Their relations, however, have been 
normalized since 1989. At present, Iran's trust in the ROK 
people is so high that the Iranian Embassy here issues visas to 
ROK people within only 24 hours. 
  [Pak] What is the reason for the increased trust in the ROK 
people? 
  [Now-Forsati] A number of foreign enterprises left Iran in 
succession during its past war with Iraq. However, ROK 
enterprises remained in Iran and kept their working sites even 
at the risk of death and wounds. The Iranian people never forget 
the favor they receive from others. 
  [Pak] What do you think is the reason that the ROK should 
attach importance to expanding economic cooperation with Iran? 
  [Now-Forsati] First, Iran, with a population of 60 
million, is an excellent market for various kinds of consumer 
goods. Moreover, Iran founded an organization for economic 
cooperation with central Asian countries that separated from the 
former Soviet Union and became independent states. Iran is 
leading this organization. Therefore, the ROK can have easy 
access to the central Asian markets with Iran as a 
stepping-stone. Second, the ROK can secure the source of stable 
oil supply based on amicable relations with Iran. Third, only 
Iran has become the nation where rich experiences of the ROK 
enterprises can be put to practical use in the Middle East. 
  [Pak] What is the degree of Iran's present economic exchange 
with the ROK? 
  [Now-Forsati] The volume of annual trade between Iran and 
the ROK reaches $2 billion. ROK enterprises, including Daewoo, 
Daelim, Samsung, Ssangyong, Sinhwa, and Hyundai, are engaged in 
the construction of roads, an oil pipeline, power stations, and 
chemical and textile plants, throughout Iran. 
  [Pak] What is the position of Iran on the peace negotiations 
between Israel and Palestine? 
  [Now-Forsati] We are opposed to such changes as seen 
today. The PLO does not reflect the will of all the Palestinian 
people. [end Now-Forsati] 
  Ambassador Now-Forsati said that it is curious that just as 
the price of land in Seoul's Tehran Street has increased 
exorbitantly, that of Tehran's Seoul Street has also drastically 
increased.

  [Excerpts] It is the Army that Kim Il-song of North Korea 
fears the most. The Army, much dissatisfied with Kim's system, 
even exchanged fire with each other in front of his official 
hall in the spring of last year. After that, at Kim's 
insistence, the Army's ammunition around Pyongyang was 
confiscated. 
  Temporarily returned to South Korea after taking part in the 
"Rally for Democratization and Recovery of Human Rights of North 
Korea," held under the auspices of "National Salvation Front for 
Democratic Unification of Korea" (National Salvation Front for 
short) in Washington D.C. last October 22, Mr. Pak Kap-tong 
(74), the standing chairman of National Salvation Front, said 
that he had heard that "the army of North Korea was very 
agitated." He thought that an internal coup could possibly 
dismantle Kim's system within two years. 
  Pak said that he had heard the following from Front members 
participating in the Washington rally as well as those living in 
exile in Russia and China, etc. If a coup occurs in North Korea, 
the new military authorities, officers above colonel rank who 
had studied in the old Soviet Union, will become the main power 
in place of the Kim Il-song faction. 
  The Front is an anti-Kim Il-song organization formed in 
Moscow in January, 1992 by North Korean defectors. Its leaders 
are Yi Sang-jo, ex-North Korean ambassador to the USSR (a 
lieutenant general of the People's Army); Mr. Suh Hui, 
ex-chairman of the Pyongyang Special City Party Chapter of 
Korean Workers Party; and Pak. 
  The 15-member Central Standing Committee has all served as 
ranking executive members in the Korean Workers Party and 
People's Army. It includes Kang Sang-ho (ex-Vice Minister of 
Home Affairs), Chung Sang-jin (ex-Vice Minister of Culture and 
Art), Pak Byong-yul (ex-Director of Kang Dong Political School), 
Yu Song-chul (ex-Chief of the Operations Bureau of Supreme 
Headquarters of the People's Army), Chang Hak-bong (ex-chief of 
the Military Academy), Shim Su-chol (ex-deputy chef de cabinet 
of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces), Yu Song-gol (ex-Head 
of the Air Force Academy), etc. The Front has a membership of 
about 300. 
  Its branches are set up in the United States, China, Japan, 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia, among others. The National 
Salvation Front, through "National Salvation" published in three 
languages, Korean, English, and Japanese, is pushing for 
recovery of human rights for North Korea's 23 million people who 
are dying of hunger, cold, and physical beatings. Its supreme 
task is "to drive out Kim Il-song and his son." 
  The Front made eight demands at the Washington rally: 1) 
Eviction of "Human slaughterer Kim Il-song and his son from 
office at once!" 2) release of political prisoners, 3) freedom 
of the press, 4) freedom of assembly and association, 5) freedom 
of residence, 6) right to choose occupation, 7) guaranteed 
reunification of separated families, 8) guarantee of free 
hometown visits. [passage omitted] 
  This writer asked Pak Kab-tong, who temporarily returned to 
South Korea, about the activities of the Front and the North 
Korean army unrest as well as that of the population of which 
the Front knows. 
  To what extent is North Korea's army agitated? 
  "According to the information we obtained, North Korea, 
after 
the Gulf War, had officers above regimental commander rank watch 
the videotape of the war to let them know American tactics. But 
it had a contrary effect. The commanders who watched realized 
that the outcome of modern war depends on up-to-date weapons. 
They were therefore infected with defeatism, saying that if 
North Korea started a war with conventional weapons, it would be 
defeated. The enlisted men are in a very poor health due to long 
periods underground and are extremely demoralized due to 
long-term service." 
  How do you obtain information from the closed society of 
North Korea? 
  "We get it from Russia, China, Japan, etc. The details of 
the 
channels should not be disclosed for their personal safety." 
(According to the first issue of "National Salvation," the Front 
is working in cooperation with an anti-Kim Il-song organization 
in North Korea.) 
  You said that there was a gun battle in Pyongyang, didn't 
you? 
  "To construct apartment buildings for 50,000 families in 
Pyongyang in the spring of last year, North Korea forced the 
construction, mobilizing the military in a district. The 
soldiers from the country, seeing that those serving in the 
Capitol were treated much better than themselves, forced their 
way to Kim Il-song's official hall to protest. As the 
Presidential Security Guards fired upon the soldiers to hold 
back, a gun battle broke out. After that, Kim ordered the 
troops around Pyongyang to surrender their ammunition." 
  If a gun battle had broken out, it must have been a big 
problem. 
  "Responsible persons were rebuked. But the corps commander 
of 
the troops from the country, Lieutenant General Kim Song-il, 
received immunity because he was the son of Kim Il-song and Mun 
Song-ja." 
  I haven't heard that there was a son called Kim Song-il 
among 
Kim Il-song's sons. 
  "That is because Kim's relations with women were not 
exposed. 
It is widely known that he is Kim's son. According to the 
information we obtained, there is a fierce power struggle 
between Kim Chong-il's group and the other group of Kim Song-ae 
who is Kim Il-song's wife. Kim Song-il is neutral. Kim Yong-sun, 
Kim Tal-hyon and Chang Song-taek (husband of Kim Kyong-hi, Kim 
Il-song's daughter) belong to Kim Chong-il's group. Kim Yong-ju, 
Kim Il-song's brother, and Kim Pyong-il, Kim Il-song's son, 
belong to Kim Song-ae's group." 
  It is said that a military coup was carried out and that the 
persons connected with it were executed in North Korea. 
  "Although we also heard of this, we were not able to confirm 
it. According to the information we obtained, a coup was carried 
out last July and some rebel army people fleeing North Korea 
were besieged by North Korean troops at a mountain near the 
border. At that time the Chinese Army moved in, which once took 
a stand against North Korea's army. At about that time, North 
Korea limited entry of pro-regime residents in Japan into the 
country. Such a measure has been very rare. The rumor of a coup 
circulated around this time." 
  Is there the possibility of a military coup in North Korea? 
  "Yes, as I said before, North Korea's military authorities 
are very discontented and infecteded with defeatism. If they 
were provided with ammunition, they will point their guns at 
Pyongyang. They are the biggest threaten to and the only 
substitute power for Kim Il-song's system. Split into the old 
and new generations, the military authorities will unite to 
seize power. Thereafter, the new generation will gain supremacy 
over the old generation, I expect." 
  Exactly what do you mean by "the new generation of the 
military authorities"? 
  "Officers above colonel, most of whom studied in the USSR, 
are the new military authorities. Because they served under the 
members of the Front in the past, they and the Front will, I 
think, understand each other. To restrain the new military 
authorities, Kim Il-song replaced company officers with those 
who did not study abroad, I heard." 
  When do you expect the coup by the new military authorities? 
  "If the North Korea's nuclear program is sanctioned 
immediately by the U.N., a coup will occur within the year. If 
North Korea enters into diplomatic relations with the U.S. or 
Japan, it will endure another two years before collapsing. Even 
if the new military authorities seize power, the unification of 
North and South Koreas will be possible only after five to six 
years from that point," I suppose. 
  Will it be possible for North Korea to start a war? 
  "War rumors are nothing but Kim Il-song threats. How can he 
start a war with such out-of-date weapons and demoralized 
soldiers? Because South Korea's government does not react 
strongly to North Korean threats, North Korea is spreading these 
rumors." 
  How much information about North Korea's nuclear program do 
you have? 
  "We once obtained information that North Korea had requested 
a nuclear bomb test range from the USSR under Brezhnev. Judging 
from this information, the nuclear weapons development of North 
Korea seems to have been ripe for testing. I also, during my 
stay in North Korea in 1956, heard a member of the South Korean 
Workers Party speak about the construction of nuclear weapons 
underground works. But nuclear weapons are merely a threat to 
South Korea and Japan, and can never be used." 
  Is any power collaborating with the Front in North Korea? 
  "Two hundred thousand political prisoners detained in the 
prison camps and 3 million nonsupporters, who are permanently 
detained in the collective farms in the mountains near the Yalu 
and Tumen Rivers, are opponents of Kim Il-song. They have the 
same opinion as we. Twenty thousand North Koreans who defected 
to China, now known to have been collectively housed in Inner 
Mongolian regions, may also be collaborators with us." 
  To contact those people, what measures is the Front taking? 
  "Although the Front is planning a variety of measures such 
as 
running broadcasting stations, etc. to let the population of 
North Korea know the truth about the outside world, it is in 
trouble for lack of funds. At present it concentrates its 
efforts on publicizing of what the Front really is." 
  How do you raise funds? 
  "Those who defected to Japan while being active members of 
the South Korean Workers Party in the past total about 30,000. 
Many of them are rich. The Front manages to keep going with 
their help."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] North Korean [NK] propaganda 
claiming that Kim Chong-il is inspecting front-line units, 
pushing for more military training, and carrying out other 
vigorous leadership activities is greatly increasing. 
  Through his "outstanding, military leadership skills," Kim 
Chong-il directly managed 

  -  the April, 1964 hostile action at the Military Demarcation 
Line, 
  -  the January, 1968 taking of the U.S. naval vessel Pueblo, 
and 
  -  the April, 1969 downing of an EC-121 aircraft, reported the 
official North Korean Central News Agency [KCNA] through its 
broadcast (on November 10th) of the "Kim Chong-il Revolutionary 
History, Lecture Number 78." 
  Before this, through a commentary program (April 17th) 
called, "With the Wisdom and Courage of a Supreme Commander," 
the KCNA claimed that Kim Chong-il "made brilliant contributions 
in strengthening the nations defense in every way": 

  -  by visiting North Korean Army [NKA] front-line guard posts 
in February, 1963, encouraging "one-is-worth-a-hundred fighting 
power"; 
  -  by visiting naval units in mid-October, 1975, 
inspecting fleet maneuver training and marine training amid the 
inclement weather of a driving storm; and 
  -  understanding the 
pattern, order of battle and organization of the tactical 
preparations of units above division level, by making concrete 
suggestions on capability and material augmentation and on 
combat usage of such units, to mark the 50th anniversary of the 
founding of the NKA on April 25, 1984. 
  Thus highlighting Kim Chong-il's leadership activities 
concerning the NKA, to further accentuate his military 
leadership ability, in November NK created a new KCNA discussion 
program called, "The Great Presence of the Supreme Commander" 
(presently on third broadcast), and the Ministry of People's 
Armed Forces [MPAF] held (November 11th) a "Forum for the Study 
and Discussion of the Greatness of Comrade Kim Chong-il." 
  In the program (KCNA November 14), "The Great Presence of 
the 
Supreme Commander," Kim Chong-il was held up as, "An 
extraordinarily brilliant supreme commander with complete 
mastery of Kim Il-song's autonomous military thought and 
tactics," and as, "an extraordinarily brilliant supreme 
commander who knows not even an instant of worry or agitation, 
though the most powerful enemy in the world attacks, who lays 
out bold operational plans with great ease, before which his 
frightened enemies fall, who has courage and will power as yet 
not possessed by any other in the world." 
  In a forum in which senior military officials, Chief of 
General Staff Choe Kwang, General Political Bureau Deputy 
Director Yi Pong-won, and MPAF Deputy Minister Kim Kwang-chin 
participated, Kim Chong-il was proclaimed to be the "great 
leader of the people, who set up an autonomous military command 
system and unceasingly increases its fighting power and 
armaments." 
  NK's recent concentration on propaganda concerning Kim 
Chong-il's military leadership activities, even presenting 
concrete examples, is understood to be an attempt to placate the 
military, to eliminate the debate seething within it on Kim 
Chong-il's lack of experience in NK military affairs and his 
resulting suitability as supreme commander of the military and 
Chief of State, and to elicit loyalty from the military. 
  According to the testimony of recent defectors, since Kim 
Chong-il was made Supreme Commander (December 24, 1991) and 
Chief of State (April 20, 1992), dissatisfaction and complaints 
are gradually growing within the military: "Following the 
political and economic sectors, Kim Chong-il is now going to 
ruin even the military." Accordingly, the MPAF is even reported 
to have carried out a "Military-wide Ideological 
Questionnaire-Survey" to determine trends within the military.

Under Changing World Economy"] 
<H3>  [25 Dec p 1] Impossible To 
Survive Under Old Frame </H3>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Throughout the process of the 
Uruguay Round [UR] settlement it was obvious that the United 
States and the EC, particularly the former, called the tune in 
making all settlements. Japan exercised a very marginal 
influence, and the influence of the rest of the countries was 
negligible. Fortunately, the principle of free trade was pushed 
through to the end. However, it cannot be overlooked that big 
powers were more persistent in promoting their national 
interests than in any previous negotiations. In his official 
message to the U.S. Congress calling for the passage of the UR 
agreements, U.S. President Clinton pledged that he will "see to 
it that U.S. interests will be protected" in future negotiations. 
  What would the world trade organization [WTO] order be like? 
It would be the kind of order in which all countries, nay, all 
enterprises in all countries will compete with each other 
one-on-one. It will not only govern competition in commodity 
trade but also in services, brain power and knowledge, and 
ability among nations and enterprises. Expansion of competition 
will pose an awesome challenge to us. Underdeveloped countries 
might be able to hold their own in competition in commodity 
trade. But they will discover that there are many areas in the 
software field, such as technology, brain power, and knowledge, 
where they are no match for their competitors from the 
beginning. They will also discover that rules governing 
competition are not interpreted in a uniformly fair manner. Just 
as lions get their lion's share in the food chain, advanced 
countries will interpret the substance of the economic order in 
a way advantageous to themselves. While absorbed in exporting 
commodities, the underdeveloped might lose everything before 
they are aware of it, like a hunter too much absorbed in chasing 
a hare to see the mountain. 
  During the recent UR negotiations, our country ran about in 
confusion like soldiers surprised by the enemy. The UR is 
concluded for now, and work will begin soon to work out details 
necessary to implement it. We should immediately revise a number 
of laws, regulations, and systems to prevent outsiders from 
unilaterally setting our national destiny without our knowledge. 
  Economic policies under the WTO order cannot succeed with 
the conventional methods and ideas. If so, what should be 
changed, and how? First, the government's functions and roles 
must be changed. "Economic planning" by the government will 
become virtually meaningless. It will be practically impossible 
to make cyclical adjustments through Keynesian stop-gap 
government intervention. We come to keenly realize that 
globalization signifies a limitation on government economic 
policy-making. With the WTO order, the government will no longer 
be able to control and adjust the economy unilaterally and at 
will. For instance, as foreign capital moves from one country to 
another as a result of the liberalization of capital, currency 
authorities will not be able to maintain a certain volume of 
currency in circulation as they please. Needless to say, this 
does not mean that the role of currency authorities will be 
eliminated. In some areas, their role may even increase. But 
their role and meaning should change. The government should 
review and reorganize its roles and functions as soon as 
possible so that they may be adapted to the new environment 
under the WTO. Our government structure is a carryover from the 
era in which it was to help attain the growth targets under the 
closed economic system of the 1960's and 70's. Public 
understanding of its functions still remains at that level. With 
this structure it will be difficult to flexibly take up the 
challenge of the WTO era. The concept that prevailed in those 
says gave rise to a tendency to denigrate the role of the price 
mechanism and be overconfident of the control function of 
government agencies. All policies based on this is bound to end 
in failure in the WTO era. 
<H3>  [28 Dec 93 p 1] Costly, Inefficient Structure Needs Urgent 
Revamping </H3>
  [Text] To adapt ourselves to the WTO era, we need to push 
for the establishment of an order founded on free competition 
as extensively and swiftly as possible. Needless to say, order 
under free competition does not simply mean laissez-faire. Order 
founded on free competition cannot take root in a vacuum. It 
needs rules for its preservation and development. Just as the 
old order founded on control was a "system," the order founded 
on free competition is similarly a "system" based on strict 
rules. The written part of these must be worked out and enforced 
by the government. 
  If conventional economic planning becomes unnecessary and 
stop-gap fine tuning becomes impossible, the role of the 
planning authorities (the Economic Planing Board [EPB], for one) 
needs to be changed drastically. Until now the EPB has 
formulated macroeconomic plans and made an overall adjustment of 
economic policies to fulfill goals. But instead of setting 
macroeconomic goals, the EPB will from now on have to set goals 
for liberalization and competition and piece together and adjust 
all the directions in establishing systems necessary for their 
attainment. Still intact in our economy are so many systems 
that arbitrarily regulate, ban, punish, or watch private sector 
economic activity. Most of the high cost and low efficiency of 
our economy is their legacy. 
  Will government ministries be able to fulfill satisfactorily 
the liberalization goals that reduce their own authority? It 
will be difficult to get an affirmative answer. But the flimsy 
supply system in the ROK economy characterized by high cost and 
low efficiency will not improve unless the government changes 
its ways. [passage omitted] 
  For the ROK to be internationally competitive in the WTO 
era, it is necessary to select a sound direction for 
macroeconomic policies. The most desirable macroeconomic policy 
direction in improving the high-cost, low-efficiency economic 
structure is to do away with the the stop-and-go pattern and 
consistently build up the basis of economic stability. When 
prices rise and bubbles are formed while pursuing a growth 
policy, the government switches to retrenchment; and when this 
retards growth, it returns to a growth policy once again. Under 
this kind of "stop-and-go" policy, it is impossible to gain 
competitiveness. In the current condition of the ROK economy, it 
is difficult to adopt a strong retrenchment policy. But if the 
government unflaggingly pursues a determined policy of 
stabilization for several years while pushing reforms designed 
to establish an order founded on free competition, it will be 
able to attain desirable results without fail. This is the only 
way to win public trust and response. The majority want price 
stability more than anything. "Macroeconomic stability and 
microeconomic liberalization"--this will be the most appropriate 
policy mix at present. 
  This mix will be accompanied by many difficulties. It will 
be difficult to expect immediate results. For this reason, it is 
very possible that it will come under attack from an impatient 
press and interest groups. That is why it will be difficult to 
pursue without economic vision and conviction. There is the 
danger of reverting to the old stop-and-go policy. Many desire 
easy growth; they want capitalism without cost. But no such 
capitalism has ever succeeded. 
  Most important for the ROK economy now is monetary reform. 
The United States and other big powers are expected to press 
hard for financial liberalization in our country in the future. 
Should we fail to prepare for this pressure, we could find 
ourselves running about in confusion just as we did in the 
opening of the rice market. What kind of preparation do we need? 
The most essential preparation will be the "liberalization of 
the domestic financial market." We should move up Phases III and 
IV in the liberalization schedule as soon as possible. It is 
desirable to reduce or abolish policy-driven financing, 
liberalize all interest rates including those on bank loans, 
establish a responsible management system for banking 
organizations, and abolish all forms of window guidance. To this 
end, many statutes and regulations for financial control need be 
revised. When liberalization is pursued while curbing inflation, 
it will bring about increased savings, stable interest rates, 
and a turnabout in our high-cost, low-efficiency economy. 
  Financial operations in the WTO era will require a high 
degree of expertise. Along with financial liberalization, it is 
desirable to revise the Bank of Korea Law so that the central 
bank may take charge of currency management. Only by so doing is 
it possible to put an end to the vicious "stop and go" cycle and 
insure expertise in financial operations. Inasmuch as the 
central bank is a government agency, there is a stark limitation 
on its "independence." Nevertheless it must be clear where 
responsibility for currency control lies in order to increase 
the effectiveness of economic policy. 
<H3>  [30 Dec 93 pp 1, 2] Cultivate Intellect, Train Personnel 
With Foresight </H3>
  [Text] Following the conclusion of the UR negotiations, the 
government announced various measures designed to achieve an 
epochal development of our agriculture. What we need is not 
epochal measures, but epochal results. But it is questionable 
whether we will be able to easily find means to achieve epochal 
results. 
  Inasmuch as our agriculture and rural communities are 
problems for our industry and society as a whole, it is 
impossible to find ways to achieve epochal development only in 
agriculture by divorcing it from the rest of the nation's 
economic policy. Many have pointed out, "Our agriculture is 
backward," or "Our rural communities are backward." But in my 
opinion, those who hold this perception labor under a 
misconception of what lies at the heart of the matter. True, our 
agriculture and rural communities are backward. But it is more 
appropriate to say that there has been a discrepancy between 
agricultural policy and directions of economic management in all 
other sectors. This was created because policies concerning 
agriculture and rural communities were always formulated 
independently of overall economic policy. As overall economic 
policy was being implemented with no link whatsoever to 
agricultural policy, the latter focused only on agriculture and 
persistently sought to increase production. As a result, 
development of non-agricultural rural income sources has been 
neglected and agriculture has continued to be wholly dependent 
on rice farming. It is impossible to reconstruct agriculture and 
rural communities so long as the dichotomy in policy described 
above remains unchanged. It is impossible to develop agriculture 
and rural communities alone by keeping agricultural policy 
separated from the economy as a whole. [passage omitted] 
  It is often said, correctly, that our economic future 
depends on export. But now that we are at the outset of the WTO 
era, it is necessary to appropriately amend this perception. We 
must think more broadly and deeply. What drives export? Export 
depends on technology and business management efficiency. What 
drives these two factors? In the final analysis, they depend on 
man, namely, talent. If our civil servants are inferior to their 
American and Japanese counterparts, if our company employees are 
inferior to their American and Japanese counterparts, if the 
level of our knowledge is below that of other nations, it is 
obvious that we will be defeated in international competition. 
[passage omitted] In a sense the WTO era may be interpreted as 
one in which the United States and Europe, finding themselves 
shoved aside by Asians countries in commodity trade, will 
challenge their Asian competitors once again by shifting from 
commodity to knowledge and intellect as weapons of competition. 
[passage omitted] Unfortunately, we have achieved no great 
success in either. 
  To begin with, the system for properly employing trained 
talent needs improvement as a short-term objective. The civil 
service system should be improved. It is well known that many of 
our civil servants are talented. But it is undeniable that there 
is ample room for improvement in the way they are employed if we 
are to achieve policy innovations to suit the tide of the times. 
[passage omitted] 
  In our country civil servants rely on the each ministry's 
research institute for supplementing their deficiencies in their 
specialties. A similar system hardly exists elsewhere. It has 
merits, but it also has serious demerits. If civil servants 
depend too much on institutes, it may become an impediment to 
their "intellectual" development in the long run, and the 
institutions will fall into the trap of working for departmental 
interests while failing to produce good research for the 
national interest. It is desirable to increase researchers' 
autonomy and reduce civil servant dependence on research 
institutions. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Nonaligned Movement's foreign ministers have 
called on Algeria, 1994 chairman of the Group of 77, to 
intensify cooperation and solidarity among developing countries 
in GATT talks. They pointed out that while the GATT talks are 
deadlocked, a new forum called World Trade Organization has been 
established. 
  This was disclosed by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas after the 
second-day session of the Nonaligned Movement's foreign 
ministers in Jakarta today. Alatas noted that there has hardly 
been any cooperation among the G-77 member countries during the 
seven-year-old Uruguay Round talks. As for the next chairman of 
the Nonaligned Movement, Alatas said Nicaragua had officially 
submitted its candidacy, but this country needs time to consult 
with Latin American countries.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, 10 Feb (PETRA) -- A meeting of the 
Consultative Ministerial Council of the Nonaligned Movement 
opened in Jakarta today. The meeting is chaired by Indonesian 
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas. 
  Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs 
and head of Jordan's delegation, made a speech at the opening 
session. [passage omitted] 
  Explaining Jordan's position on the Bosnian issue, the 
minister of state for foreign affairs pointed out that the war 
crimes committed by Serbian forces have continued despite 
international condemnation. He said: The siege on the city of 
Sarajevo and Muslim regions is getting worse. Ethnic cleansing 
is increasing at a fast pace. Mass murder and the shelling of 
civilian targets are getting uglier. More than 260 civilians 
were either killed or injured. This is an indication of the 
ugliness of this crime and the Serbs' unmatched barbarity. 
  The minister of state for foreign affairs added that after 
the partition of former Yugoslavia, Jordan was among the first 
countries to dispatch troops under the UN flag. Jordan now has 
the second largest contingent of peacekeeping troops after 
France. 
  Talal Sat'an al-Hasan added: Jordan strongly condemns 
Serbian crimes and is amazed at the silence of the international 
community toward Serbian disregard for international legitimacy 
and resolutions. Jordan believes that dialogue is a way of 
settling disputes. Therefore, it calls for an immediate 
cease-fire, starting talks, and lifting the Bosnian arms embargo 
to achieve a balance in military capabilities between the two 
warring parties. 
  Al-Hasan said Jordan urges measures and supports an urgent 
meeting for the Security Council, as proposed by the chairman, 
to restore peace to war-torn Bosnia. According to the proposed 
measures, there should be an end to the continued Serbian 
encroachments on the international borders of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia, in line with 
Security Council Resolution 796 of 1992. Also, the former 
Republic of Yugoslavia (the Serbs) should be forced to stop arms 
supplies to Serbian militias operating within the borders of the 
Republic of Bosnia in line with Security Council Resolution 819 
of 1993, lift the siege on the city of Sarajevo and other 
cities, and adopt measures to protect holy and residential 
areas. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 10 (ANTARA) -- The Organization of 
Islamic Conference (OIC) member countries pleaded to send some 
10,000 troops to be deployed as part of the United Nations 
peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "Within the U.N. system, we offer 10,000 troops which will 
come from Malaysia, Jordan, Pakistan, Egypt," chairman of the 
OIC contact group Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad 
Ali told a press conference here Thursday. 
  In the fringes of the limited ministerial meeting of the 
Nonaligned Movement (NAM) some ministers of the OIC contact 
group on Bosnia also conducted an informal meeting to discuss 
the detariorating situation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Pakistani foreign minister also said that besides the 
peacekeeping troops, OIC foreign ministers also agreed to 
support NAM chairman's proposal of convening an 
appropriately-structured international conference on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  President Suharto upon receiving Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic recently mentioned the possibility of launching an 
international conference on Bosnia to find a just settlement to 
the conflict in the region. 
  "We welcome NAM chairman's decision to conduct a meeting 
through the NAM coordinating bureau in New York to demand more 
effective measures to be undertaken by the U.N," Minister Asif, 
who was accompanied by Malaysia's Foreign Minister Abdullah 
Ahmad Badawi, said. 
  He added that the OIC contact group minsters have expressed 
their strong support for the convening of a special session of 
the general assembly to bring an end to the genocide and carnage 
in Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  When asked about NATO's 10-day ultimatum before launching 
air 
strikes if Serb artillery and other heavy weapons are not 
withdraw and placed under U.N supervision, the minister said, 
such a threat would not ensure Serbs' withdrawal of its forces. 
  Stating that the OIC contact group on Bosnia are not 
satisfied with NATO's decision, he urged NATO to immediately use 
its sophisticated armament, the one that had been used 
successfully in Iraq to launch immediate strikes against the 
Serbs. 
  "It would not ensure that [words indistinct] air strikes 
against the Serb military forces, he said that finding a 
solution for the Bosnia-Herzegovina should be the prime 
responsibility of the European Union and NATO. 
  Asif took the occassion also to remind that conflicts in the 
Balkan country had triggered the World War I and II, saying that 
"If the condition in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be worsen, the 
European countries will directly be affected."

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 11 (ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas has said that Russian president Boris Yeltsin has sent a 
letter applying for a NAM [Nonaligned Movement] guest member to 
the NAM chairman, President Suharto. 
  "I inform you that Yeltsin has sent an official letter 
requiring a status as NAM guest member," Alatas told a press 
conference here Thursday. 
  According to Alatas, the application letter will 
procedurally 
be delivered to the Coordination Bureau of NAM in New York, the 
U.S. for discussion. The minister also expressed confidence 
that the Russian wish would be accepted. 
  Meanwhile, chairman of the NAM Executive Board Nana Sutresna 
pointed out that the presence of the Russian application letter 
indicated an appreciation to the Indonesian leadership. 
  "Such an appreciation does not only come from NAM member 
countries but also from non-NAM mamber nations due to 
Indonesia's consistence in implementing decisions made at the 
NAM summit in Jakarta last year," Sutresna added. 
  NAM's guest members included Austria, Australia, New 
Zealand, 
Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany. As a NAM guest member, 
according to Sutresna, a country cannot take part in debates and 
is not involved in drafting decisions. However, a NAM guest 
member country has the advantage of getting information on the 
South nations' stance and considerations from the first hand, he 
said.

  [Text] India has again strongly protested against 
Pakistan's bid to raise the Kashmir issue at the international 
forum. The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. R.L. 
Bhatia, told the NAM [Nonaligned Movement] foreign ministers 
meeting at Jakarta that Pakistan is misusing the forum by 
raising an issue which has to be resolved bilaterally. He said 
the foreign secretaries of the two countries had met recently 
and New Delhi had made proposals on resolving bilateral issues. 
Islamabad's reply is still awaited. He said violating the 
well-established NAM tradition, Pakistan had raised the Kashmir 
issue. He asserted that Kashmir is an integral part of India -- 
the largest practicing democracy with independent judiciary and 
a free press. Fundamental human rights for all its citizens are 
enshrined in the Indian Constitution. Mr. Bhatia was using the 
right to reply after a Pakistani delegate raised the issue at 
the meeting yesterday.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Feb 11 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Several foreign 
ministers from the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) meeting here 
expressed their concern over a number of unsettled conflicts in 
parts of the world including Bosnia, Somalia and the Middle 
East. At the consultative meeting of NAM foreign ministers that 
ended on Thursday, they uged the international community to take 
serious steps in stopping the human tragedies that have claimed 
thousand of innocent lives. 
  With regard to the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
ministers agreed to seek the implementation of resolutions by 
the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) including enforcing 
"safe areas" and limited air strikes on the Serbian troops in 
Bosnia. [passage omitted] 
  Another human tragedy that was called to attention during 
the 
meeting was the protracted conflict that spawned famine, anarchy 
and massive loss of lives in Somalia. 
  Foreign Minister Alatas said that the problem today was made 
more complicated by the intended pullout of US, French, Italian 
and Turkish troops that formed the bulk of UN peacekeeping 
forces in Somalia. The withdrawal of the troops, he said, would 
aggravate problems in the region since NAM's troops from India, 
Pakistan and Malaysia would be caught between the warring 
factions. 
  "An undermaned and underarmed UN force may not be able to 
forestall renewed factional fighting," Alatas stressed. He also 
assured NAM's continued support for the UN effort by offering 
meeting places for constructive consultations among the politcal 
factions in Somalia to achieve a comprehensive solution. 
  "It is up to Somali people and their leaders to bring their 
country out of the abyss, but we remain hopeful that they will 
respond positively to the declaration issued last December by 
the 4th coordinating meeting for the establishment of a 
committee to launch the reconciliation process," Alatas said. 
  On the issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict, Alatas said that 
NAM welcomed the sigming of the declaration of principles on 
interim self-government arrangements between the PLO 
[Palestinian Liberation Organization] and Israel. Alatas said 
the peace accord, together with the mutual recognition by the 
PLO and Israel, constitutad the first essential step in tha long 
journey toward a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict. 
  "Since then, however, there has been a significant measure 
of 
disillusionment as further negotiations to flesh out its basic 
provisions have encouraged numerous obstacles," he added. He 
said the remaining obstacles to end the conflict were mainly 
inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the declaration. 
  "We are deeply concerned that the terms of Israeli 
withdrawal 
to designed areas by December 13, 1993 set up during the 
September peace accord has not yet materialised," Alatas said. 
Every effort, according to the minister, must be exerted to 
ensure Israel's compliance with the previsions of the September 
agreement which constituted the first step toward a 
comprehensive solution which involve the withdrawal of Israeli 
troops from all Palestinian and Arab territories.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, U.S. Urged To Talk Calmly"] </F>
  [Text] European and U.S. VIP's never fail to make at least 
one or two humorous remarks when they hold news conferences. 
This sets a mood that permits a calm look even at very tense 
situations. 
  But we did not see even a hint of remarks of this kind at 
the 
news conference by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who 
visited Japan in search of a breakthrough in the framework trade 
talks. This reminds us of the severe circumstances surrounding 
the Japanese-U.S. summit scheduled for 11 February. 
  Is there not a clue to solving the dispute? In this respect, 
we would like to propose that the Japanese-U.S. vice-ministerial 
talks starting on 7 February in Washington be held in a relaxed 
atmosphere. We would regret it if the Japanese-U.S. 
relationship is impaired by bilateral disputes over such issues 
as the trade in autos and insurance services. 
  To settle the bilateral trade negotiations and ensure that 
the Washington summit will be successful, it is essential that 
Japan implement the business stimulus package, including an 
income tax cut, as soon as possible. A delay in the compilation 
of the economic package has greatly influenced the trade talks, 
thus forcing the United States to take a more rigid stand. 
  This is because the U.S. economy is steadily recovering and 
because the United States has begun to regain its confidence 
about curbing its fiscal deficits and strengthening the 
international competitiveness of its enterprises such as its 
automakers, which is why the United States is adopting a bullish 
attitude. In fact, the United States may well be on its way to 
achieving its medium-range targets in the bilateral framework 
trade talks. 
  Japan, on the other hand, is a far cry from its medium-range 
target of achieving sustained growth based on domestic demand. 
In his talks with U.S. President Clinton last November, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa promised that Japan would effect a 
business-bolstering package. More than two months have passed 
since then. We have to doubt that either the prime minister or 
the ruling coalition parties understand the gravity of the 
situation. 
  In addition to the business stimulus package, the government 
must rapidly improve the government procurement system and 
promote deregulation, both of which the government alone can do 
on its own responsibility. 
  In his talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa and other 
important 
cabinet ministers, Kantor asked Japan to establish numerical 
targets for individual fields as criteria to measure the 
openness of the Japanese market. In his news conference, the 
U.S. trade representative confirmed that the United States 
reiterated its "results-oriented" stand in the framework trade 
negotiations and suggested that the United States might impose 
sanctions on Japan if the talks proved unsuccessful. 
  Both U.S. economists and their Japanese counterparts have 
expressed objections to the creation of numerical targets. Such 
targets should not be adopted because such an action threatens 
to bring about managed trade. Moreover, we do not wish to see 
the United States threatening the imposition of one-sided 
sanctions. 
  If the United States tries to take advantage of the change 
of 
Japan's government to press Japan and ignores Japan's past 
efforts in completely liberalizing the import of beef and 
oranges and increasing government purchases of computers, the 
result may be to stir up antipathy in Japan against the United 
States. Calm should not be lost. 
  Japan experienced trade frictions with the United States 
during the 12 years of the Republican administration of 
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, but now the atmosphere 
in Japan among industry and consumers has changed considerably. 
They have come to understand the need to open markets and to 
eliminate the price differences between Japan and the rest of 
the world. As a result, wider private-sector cooperation has 
been promoted between Japan and the United States. 
  Business enterprises of both Japan and the United States 
have 
seen further international expansion, and therefore they can no 
longer be termed single-nation enterprises. We hope that both 
countries' negotiators will not ignore this phenomenon.

  [Text] Washington, 8 Feb -- Whether an accord can be 
reached at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks now hinges on 
which side will compromise on the numerical target issue. So 
far, neither has made any moves toward compromise. However, 
some members of the Japanese group engaged in negotiations in 
Washington have begun to share a need for concession. Thus, 
hard-line officials -- mainly from the Ministry of Finance and 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry -- have once 
again called for caution and warned the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs against giving too much consideration to the United 
States. 
  Regarding the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, a 
diplomatic source in the United States said: "If the talks 
should break down, our efforts accumulated so far will go down 
the drain, and such a situation must be avoided." In this way, 
he maintained that due consideration should be given to the 
United States. His comments indicate that Japan should make 
concessions because the U.S. Congress is now moving toward 
submitting a bill on retaliatory measures against Japan. At 
the same time, the same source was also aware that the views of 
Japanese hard-liners must be taken into consideration, and said: 
"I am not saying that Japan should make unreasonable 
compromises. But what is important is that the talks must be 
brought to an appropriate settlement."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Shinichi Yoshida] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 10 Feb -- "It is believed that Prime 
Minister Hosokawa established the Japan New Party, while 
advocating the need to open the Japanese market by tearing down 
the bureaucratic system." While both Japanese and American 
negotiators are continuing their last-ditch efforts to seek a 
political settlement of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
the U.S. Government, taking aim at Prime Minister Hosokawa, is 
coming out to politically jolt the prime minister in an 
unprecedented way in a bid to press him to make a political 
decision on Japan's acceptance of the U.S. trade demands as a 
"reformist," while citing his past statements. 
  At a 9 February news conference at the White House, U.S. 
Trade Representative Kantor and other American officials took 
tough attitude toward Japan. At the news conference, Mr. Cutter, 
assistant to the president, said: "A consensus has been built in 
the Japanese society that Japan must open its market, but our 
Japanese negotiating counterparts take a view different from the 
consensus. We have called them bureaucrats, but we had better 
call them obstinate officials of the Japanese Government." In 
this way, the senior American official attacked bureaucrats in 
Kasumigaseki in an unprecedentedly harsh tone. 
  At the news conference, an unidentified reporter asked: "If 
the prime minister were put to shame, will it not put 
U.S.-supported Japanese reforms in danger?" In response, Mr. 
Kantor said, "He will not be put to shame for holding frank 
discussions." He also stressed that the prime minister, in his 
article written when he established the Japan New Party last 
year, stated that tearing down the Japanese bureaucratic system 
will result in building a society where priority is given to 
consumers." He went on to say: "We are trying to consolidate 
the fragile power base for the Hosokawa government." 
  Claiming that the reason for the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. 
negotiations lies in the Japanese bureaucratic system, the U.S. 
Government has pinned its hopes on the prime minister to make a 
political decision to break the deadlock. The actual situation, 
however, is that the prime minister has relied on bureaucrats 
for his management of policies and the U.S. Government learned 
about the situation from the tax-increase upheaval that occurred 
shortly before the prime minister left Japan for Washington. 
The U.S. Government, therefore, is trying to drive a wedge 
between the prime minister and the bureaucrats on the eve of the 
Japan-U.S. summit talks. 
  The U.S. Government does not anticipate that the prime 
minister will easily act at the beck of its tactics, but it is 
revealing its intention to whip up "domestic pressure" in Japan 
by selling the Japanese the impression that the "United States 
stands by Japanese consumers." It can be said that the United 
States is trying to adopt a Japanese version of the 
"campaign-style politics" that the Clinton administration has 
used to drum up public support through a publicity offensive.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 12 February Evening Edition] </F>
  [Text] At a 12 February news conference, Hiroshi Kumagai, 
minister of international trade and industry, commented on the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, on which the two countries 
have failed to reach an agreement. He indicated his view that 
the talks should be taken back to the drawing board and 
negotiations should be started afresh, saying: "The two 
governments should go back to the point of last July when an 
agreement was reached on the framework (of the economic 
consultations), and then they should make a fresh start." 
Kumagai also stated: "It has now become clear that there is a 
difference between Japan and the United States over 
interpretation of the framework." Thus, he indicated that the 
main cause of the failure of the two countries to reach an 
accord lay in a difference between the both sides over 
interpretation of objective criteria. Then, Kumagai criticized 
the U.S. stance of sticking to its result-oriented policy in the 
negotiations as it has done before, saying: "We would like the 
U.S. Government to consider the fact that (after last July when 
the agreement was reached on the framework on the economic 
talks,) the Hosokawa administration was established under the 
slogan of promoting deregulation." Moreover, with regard to 
relations between Japan and the United States, Kumagai pointed 
out: "The mature relationship means that both sides can clarify 
their differences. Japan and the United States have to try to 
establish such a relationship."

<F P=106> [Article by editorial staff member Hideo Tamura] </F>
  [Text] With the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, there is now a possibility that Japan-U.S. 
economic relations will enter a "cold peace" (according to 
Jeffrey Garten, U.S. under secretary of commerce). At a time 
like this, the issue of UN economic sanctions against the DPRK 
over its suspected manufacture of nuclear devices has come up. 
This is symbolic of the fact that even after the end of the 
Cold War, cooperation in security between Japan and the United 
States is still of much more importance than their economic 
relations. Whether Japan is able to separate security matters 
from the overall framework for coordinating economic interests 
will be a key issue for Japan from now on. 
  It is said that while Japanese and U.S. Government officials 
were repeating their arguments and counterarguments in the 
framework talks last fall, secret contacts were under way in 
Beijing between Israel and North Korea. The DPRK allegedly 
proposed that in return for its commitment to refrain from 
selling missiles to Israel's Middle Eastern enemies, such as 
Iran, Israel should pledge arms assistance to the DPRK amounting 
to $1 billion. 
  The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was able to 
obtain 
this information, while Japan was unable to do so. This was in 
spite of the fact that the intermediary between Israel and North 
Korea was a foreign trading firm closely connected with Japan, 
and that if the deal had been concluded, it would have had a 
great impact on security relations in East Asia. Moreover, 
while North Korean residents in Japan remit more than 60 billion 
yen a year to the DPRK, and they travel to and from North Korea 
quite often, Japan is never informed of developments inside the 
DPRK. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa strongly asserted at his 
talks with President Bill Clinton that bilateral relations "have 
matured" to the extent where Japan has come to be able to say no 
to the United States. However, even without bringing up the 
Japan-U.S. security pact, it is a fact that Japan is 
unilaterally dependent on the worldwide U.S. security umbrella. 
It is far from having achieved an "equal and matured 
relationship." Only the U.S. Government was able to stop Israel 
from assisting North Korea. 
  On the issue of sanctions against North Korea, Japan has 
informed the United States that it is impossible to stop 
remittances from Japan to the DPRK. However, the truth about 
the Japan-U.S. relationship is that if the United States insists 
on its demands, Japan has no other recourse but to comply. 
  One factor that complicates the Japan-U.S. framework talks 
is 
that, as in the case of the North Korean issue, the talks 
overlap with the "security" issue. A year ago, the Clinton 
administration declared that "trade is a matter of national 
security" and designated Japan, which it viewed as increasing 
its trade surplus while refusing to open its market, as its 
current main target in the area of trade. Garten wrote that 
after the end of the Cold War, the world has entered an era of 
"cold peace" in terms of economic interests between the United 
States, Japan, and Europe. 
  Japan's refusal to accept numerical targets is, indeed, 
valid 
in terms of economic theory, as pointed out by economists in 
both Japan and the United States. However, this question has 
always been regarded as a political issue in the United States 
which Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale often terms a 
"political football game." From the political point of view, 
Japan lacks the overall capability to repel pressure from the 
United States. If the relationship of trust between the two 
countries in security matters is undermined, this would 
certainly bring chaos to the Japanese financial and capital 
markets and unsettle the Japanese economy. 
  Japan should face the security issue as a fact of life, and 
it can only convince the United States by achieving results in 
reducing the trade surplus and market liberalization through its 
own efforts. At the same time, both the government and the 
private sector should strive to acquire better planning and 
implementation abilities to minimize the impact of bilateral 
trade frictions on political and security issues, because the 
weakening of Japan-U.S. relations will undermine security and 
economic stability in Asia and the world.

  [Text] President Clinton reportedly said on 11 February 
that foreign exchange rates will be included in the "objective 
criteria," designed to measure Japan's progress in liberalizing 
its market. In this regard, the Japanese Government and the 
Bank of Japan [BOJ] are strongly denying the possibility of 
introducing the objective criteria, saying: "The exchange rate 
should be determined according to the fundamentals (basic 
economic conditions) and the U.S. monetary authorities share the 
same idea." Saying that "we will fulfill our role as the 
monetary authorities if the exchange rate significantly responds 
to political factors," the BOJ is prepared to intervene in the 
market by selling yen and buying dollars should the value of the 
yen increase further at the Tokyo Foreign Exchange market. 
  Regarding the President's remark, the BOJ points out that 
the 
President "merely explained a general view that the exchange 
rate has an impact on the trade imbalance." In this way, the BOJ 
is saying that it is impossible to introduce the objective 
criteria. 
  The President's remark implicitly indicates his intention to 
induce Japan's concession by hinting at the possibility of using 
the card called "inducing sharp appreciation of the yen" once 
again because the Japan-U.S. summit talks failed to produce any 
progress. Officially, the government and the BOJ are faking 
calm, saying that it is also undesirable for the United States 
to incite further increase in the yen's value against the dollar 
because it will eventually lead to "a rise in long-term interest 
rates in the United States." However, a further increase in 
yen's value will also decrease business confidence and might 
negate the effect of the economic stimulus package.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "U.S. Lacks Understanding of Japan's </F>
Economic Pump-Priming Package"] 
  [Text] It has been reported that U.S. President Bill 
Clinton expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's economic stimulus 
package at the Japanese-U.S. summit talks, which ended 
unsuccessfully. In refuting this, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] 
maintains, "It appears that the United States does not 
understand the package well because of an inadequate analysis of 
its details" (as stated by an International Finance Bureau 
source). 
  The President expressed his dissatisfaction to Prime 
Minister 
Hosokawa at the summit talks, saying: "The package fails to 
meet the accord reached at the framework talks held last July. 
We agreed that the `trade deficit will be reduced to a very 
remarkable extent.'" Touching on the income tax cut in 
particular, which amounts to 6 trillion yen, President Clinton 
pointed out, "I am concerned that people will put the money they 
get from the tax cut into their savings accounts if the tax cut 
plan is meant to continue for only one year." 
  Concerning the President's remarks, the MOF observes that 
Clinton's dissatisfaction lies in the fact that in its 
appearance, the total amount of the final income tax cut dropped 
to "6 trillion yen for a one-year period" while Prime Minister 
Hosokawa originally made a commitment of "18 trillion yen for a 
three-year period" when he announced his concept on introducing 
the national welfare tax. 
  The MOF maintains: "The concept concerning the national 
welfare tax is based on a tax increase after three years. 
However, the current tax cut is based on the issuing of 
deficit-covering bonds only, and no decisions have been made on 
future plans. In this connection, the current tax cut can be 
said to be closer to the U.S. request for a tax cut by issuing 
deficit-covering bonds." Thus, the MOF source explains that the 
President's dissatisfaction has resulted from his insufficient 
understanding of the details of the tax cut plan.

development by the DPRK (North Korea), a government source said 
on the morning of 10 February: "If no progress is made at the 
negotiations, there will be no other choice but to launch 
economic sanctions." Thus, he disclosed his view that if North 
Korea should keep on refusing nuclear inspections requested by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), economic 
sanctions by the UN Security Council would become unavoidable. 
As for the Japanese Government's actions if the UN Security 
Council's decides to adopt economic sanctions, the same source

but to cooperate. In other words, we will do our utmost within 
the framework of the Constitution."

  [Text] Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the Policy Research 
Council of the Liberal Democratic Party, held a news conference 
at the party headquarters on the evening of 12 February. 
Commenting on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks on the 
issue of sanctions against the DPRK at the Japan-U.S. summit 
talks that "Japan will take every possible action within the 
framework of the Constitution," Hashimoto criticized the prime 
minister, and said: "We are greatly concerned whether Japan will 
be allowed to take actions within the framework of the 
Constitution in case this issue is turned over to the UN 
Security Council for debate. Since it is not the United States 
but Japan that will be asked to make sensible responses, how can 
the prime minister remain so calm?" Thus, Hashimoto indicated 
his strong concern as to whether the government would be 
sufficiently able to respond quickly to the increasingly tense 
situation in the Far East.

  [Text] China intends to join the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) within this year. The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs [MOFA] positively supports this plan and is 
moving to call on the international community to "let China join 
it at an early date." This is because the MOFA has judged that 
"incorporating China into the framework of a market economy will 
eventually promote its reform." Japan also plans to take the 
initiative in holding bilateral tariff talks with China, which 
are preliminary steps to joining GATT, and appeal for "speeding 
up the procedures for China's admission" at the GATT's Uruguay 
Round ministerial conference to be held in Marrakech, Morocco, 
in April for signing the accord. 
  The current situation indicates that the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) will likely be inaugurated six months ahead 
of the original schedule. An accord was reached at the Uruguay 
Round talks that GATT will be changed into WTO in July 1995. It 
is with this background that Japan has started assisting China's 
early admission. If China should fail to obtain GATT membership 
within this year, it will also fail to become a founding WTO 
member. Then, China will have to once again start its 
application for the WTO membership after its inauguration. In 
this case, it is most likely that China's participation will be 
further delayed. 
  A senior MOFA official expressed his concern, and said: "If 
China is kept out of the WTO, the multinational rules in world 
trade will not be perfect." Moreover, the MOFA aims at 
indirectly checking the United States by having China admitted 
into the WTO system. 
  In a bid to win the membership before the year ends, China 
has been engaged in improving its trade conditions at home. For 
example, the dual exchange rates for the yuan were unified into 
one early this year. In March, GATT will hold working-level 
panel meetings on China's participation. However, in connection 
with the issue of renewal of the most-favored-nation status for 
China, the United Stated has indicated a cautious stance on 
China's GATT admission. Thus, if the current state is left 
unchanged, China may face a delicate situation regarding its 
GATT participation within this year.

  [Text] On 3 February, Defense Agency [DA] Director General 
Kazuo Aichi met with Prime Minister Hosokawa at the prime 
minister's official residence. At the meeting, Aichi touched on 
the issue of the defense budget for fiscal 1994 and demanded 
that expenses be approved as requested in the roughly estimated 
budget demand. Director General Aichi said: "The roughly 
estimated budget demand calls for a 1.95 percent increase 
compared to the DA budget for fiscal 1993. However, we can keep 
it down to about a 1.6 percent increase if we look closely into 
the contents, including the foreign exchange rate. I hope it 
will not be trimmed more than that because further reduction 
will affect training and other matters." 
  Moreover, Ko Nakai, deputy secretary general of the Social 
Democratic Party, also met with Prime Minister Hosokawa on the 
same day at the prime minister's official residence. Nakai 
handed over a request, which calls for the approval of the 1994 
DA budget's full amount while giving considerations to defense 
industries, to the prime minister.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Tax Reductions Should Be Turned Into a First </F>
Step for Fundamental Tax Reform"; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 9 
Feb 94 Morning Edition] 
  [Text] The dispute over the tax reduction issue has been 
resolved with the government agreeing to cut 6 trillion yen, 
mostly from income taxes, on the premise the revenue source to 
fill in financial shortfalls arising from the reduction will be 
decided upon by the end of this year. We consider this action 
has been unavoidable in view of the given unpredictable 
situation of the economy and the fast approaching Japan-U.S. 
summit. It will have the effect of stimulating the economy. We 
believe it should be turned into a first step for fundamental 
tax reform, and should be linked to discussions on tax reform -- 
with the future of Japan's economy in perspective. 
  A public opinion survey conducted by phone by NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN revealed about 60 percent of the people recognize the 
need to raise the consumption tax in the future. If this is 
viewed against the hustle among the government and ruling 
parties over the last several days, it becomes clear that the 
politicians and bureaucrats have wasted precious time in 
anachronistic bargaining. 
  The general public accurately understands the need for 
fundamental tax reform. The happenings witnessed in the prime 
minister's out-of-the-blue announcement for a "national welfare 
tax" of 7 percent, and then scrapping the idea, are nothing but 
an outcome of attempts to deceive the people. Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa insisted "there was a problem in the process 
of arriving at a decision." But he should have also repented 
for not having trusted the people. 
  What is important in future discussions is to define the 
forthcoming tax reductions as the first step in fundamental tax 
reform which will be based on readjusting the weight of direct 
and indirect taxes. To do that, it is essential to make 
reductions in the income and residential tax not a temporary 
event for only one year, but to incorporate the reductions in 
the revised progressive system when the taxation system is 
reformed next year. 
  The revenue for shortfalls from the tax reductions must come 
from increasing the consumption tax. Of course, thorough 
rationalization of expenditures should become a condition to it. 
But raising the consumption tax is unavoidable if the 
government wants to stop the financial conditions from worsening 
further, and yet still build a taxation system appropriate for 
the upcoming society made up of an aged population. Hence, the 
point of concern should rest only with when the increases begin 
and how high the rate should be set. 
  The coalition parties have agreed to pass related bills by 
the end of this year. In view of the existing economic 
situation, it is desirable that they be extensive and flexible 
in substance. Furthermore, as we have said time and again, 
debate on them should be made on the principle of respecting the 
"neutrality of tax revenue" [as published]. The government 
should push ahead with the new tax measures, regarding them as 
tax reductions to stimulate the economy, and also as a step 
toward building up a tax system which can support a society made 
up of an aged population. 
  In doing so, the government should present a future vision 
of 
Japan's economy as specifically as possible. 
  Besides, in increasing the consumption tax, the government 
needs to take another look at the current simplified levying 
[kani-kazei] system which is creating the problem of the 
so-called "eki-zei" [pocketing of tax money by businesses]. 
  The government should not think about changing the name of 
the consumption tax or about confining uses for the money 
collected from it. It should not be necessary to again point 
out the problems which will arise if the consumption tax -- 
which is as important a source of tax revenue as much as the 
income tax -- is made a specific tax earmarked for use only for 
stated purposes. It should not even be necessary to cite past 
examples when warning about the danger of such actions creating 
rigid expenditures. 
  It is essential that discussions on tax reform should 
involve 
all Japanese. The government must not rely on politicians' 
logic or bureaucrats' theories alone. Of course, using tax 
reform as a means of political strife must be banned. We 
request the government provide as much information as possible 
to the general public to aid in their understanding and as a way 
of ensuring no mistakes are made in the future.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Several sources close to Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa have disclosed that the prime minister, who has just 
returned from his visit to the United States, decided on 13 
February to embark on a reshuffle of his cabinet as early as 
immediately after the government draft for the fiscal year 1994 
budget is decided upon on 15 February, to enable his cabinet to 
steer through the regular Diet session, and to deal with the 
pending deliberations on the revenue sources to cover the income 
tax cut, and other issues. It is said that the prime minister 
is thinking of replacing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura (head of Sakigake [Harbinger]), and State Minister for 
Political Reform Sadao Yamahana and other Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] cabinet members, while maintaining the 
existing framework of the ruling coalition parties. He will now 
have to obtain the consent of the ruling coalition parties. 
  The main reason for the prime minister's decision to 
reshuffle the cabinet is his belief that differences of views 
within the cabinet have become an obstacle to the management of 
the administration, as seen in the decision-making process 
leading to the announcement of the "national welfare tax" 
scheme, wherein criticisms from the people made Hosokawa unable 
to decide on revenue sources to cover the 6-trillion-yen income 
tax cut, thus forcing him to leave the issue to further 
discussions by the ruling coalition parties. The opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is certain to pursue this point 
during Diet deliberations on the third supplementary budget 
beginning on 16 February. Hosokawa thus came to the conclusion 
that a reorganization of the cabinet would be indispensable. 
  Furthermore, Hosokawa seems to believe that in view of the 
tasks facing the administration, such as early formulation of 
measures to reduce the trade surplus -- which he pledged at the 
Japan-U.S. summit talks -- and the delineation of new electoral 
districts with the introduction of the new electoral system 
incorporating both single-seat constituencies and proportional 
representation, and since these issues bear directly on the 
realignment of the political world -- which has become highly 
probable with the passage of the political reform laws -- it is 
necessary to shake up his administration in preparation for 
political realignment. 
  Due to such thinking on the part of the prime minister, the 
focus of the reshuffle is likely to be on what will happen to 
Takemura, who has been reported to be in conflict with Ichiro 
Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. It 
seems that either he will be given a different portfolio in the 
cabinet, or another Sakigake member will be chosen to replace 
him. 
  It is also believed that since policy differences with the 
SDPJ have been complicating the decisionmaking process among the 
ruling coalition parties -- for instance, the SDPJ's dissent 
during the deliberations on tax reforms -- Yamahana and the five 
other SDPJ cabinet members may be replaced with other SDPJ 
members to strengthen support for the Hosokawa administration. 
  However, it is highly possible that Sakigake and the SDPJ's 
left wing will come out strongly against the prime minister's 
reshuffle plan. It is still somehow uncertain whether the prime 
minister will be able to carry out the reshuffle as planned.

<F P=106> [Article by Hisao Imai, political commentator] </F>
  [Text] It may be safely said that Nagata-cho, where the 
forces of strength have changed with the shocking turnover of 
political power, is astir today with the focus on the good 
rivalry of the three politicians, Hosokawa, Kono, and Ozawa. The 
time has finally come for the showdown with the commencement of 
the special Diet session as the "site for the decisive 
confrontations." 
<H3>  Hosokawa Achieved Political Power by Capitalizing on the 
Collapse of the LDP Government </H3>
  Nagata-cho is revolving on the axis formed by the three 
persons, namely, Prime Minister Hosokawa, leading representative 
of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Ozawa and Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] President Kono. This statement is not an 
exaggeration. 
  The clamor right now is "Hosokawa, Hosokawa," but the 
Hosokawa of a year and a half ago was only a bum from 
Nagata-cho. His personal history contains only the credentials 
of former governor of Kumamoto Prefecture and former Diet member 
of the upper house. When he formed the Japan New Party in May 
1992 nobody, frankly speaking, paid any attention to him. 
  Hosokawa's new party increased its strength with four people 
in the upper house election, 20 people in the Metropolitan 
Assembly election and 35 people in the general election. The 
increase in strength, of course, was really trifling. But 
conspiring with Shinseito, he drew in such established political 
parties as the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], Komeito, 
and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] to form a coalition 
government and he himself took over the leadership. He is not 
just an ordinary person. 
  Moreover, the fact is that he had not promoted any lofty 
political doctrine and it was not a situation of expressing an 
attractive policy that would capture the imagination of the 
people. He seized Nagata-cho with only two key slogans, namely, 
political reform and LDP opposition. 
  But the Hosokawa government is not something that dropped 
unexpectedly out of the clouds. Several harbingers were evident. 
The LDP lost its majority in the upper house election when the 
Uno cabinet was in power in 1989, and thereafter politics took 
on strange twists. Then the unforgettable 17 August 1992 when 
Kanemaru, the former LDP vice president who had exerted his 
authority as don of Nagata-cho, admitted having received illegal 
contributions of 500 million yen, and he resigned from the 
positions of LDP vice president and head of the Takeshita 
faction. Since then, the LDP has been shattered, with the 
Takeshita faction splitting into two and the Hata faction 
bolting from the party. 
  These developments led to the passage of the no-confidence 
motion against the Miyazawa cabinet, which originally was not 
supposed to have passed; the dissolution of the lower house and 
the loss of political power by the LDP with its defeat in the 
general election. The fact is that the LDP's independent 
political power of one-party domination that lasted, before one 
knew what was happening, for 38 years collapsed resoundingly. I 
feel that in terms of speed, the collapse occurred much faster 
than the downfall of the former Soviet Communist Party's 
organization after a 75-year domination. 
  And paralleling exactly the course of the LDP's political 
power collapse, Hosokawa established the Japan New Party; 
gradually increased his colleagues; pulled in other parties and 
finally took over the reins of government by replacing the LDP. 
It must be said that Hosokawa's intuition and behavior are those 
of a genius. 
  Hosokawa was exactly like young Nobunaga Oda who, while 
setting out to battle as a lone warrior and picking up allies 
along the way, launched a surprise attack against Yoshimoto 
Imagawa at Okehazama and decapitated him. A review of Hosokawa's 
paternal ancestors revealed a feudal lord, Yusai Hosokawa, of 
Higo country with a fief yielding 540,000 koku of rice. Although 
outwardly appearing weak, Hosokawa has the blood of a lord of 
the age of civil strife coursing through him. That he resembles 
Nobunaga Oda is not a strange thought. 
  And at the same time, his mother is descended from the 
Konoye 
family, which was the highest of the five regent families. There 
is no one in Nagata-cho who is not aware that Hosokawa's 
maternal grandfather was Prince Fumimaro Konoye. The Konoye 
family has continued the blood lineage of "heavenly beings" 
since Daishokkan [high court rank] Kamaashi Fujiwara's days, for 
over a thousand years. The heavenly beings, in other words the 
members of the court nobility, were unarmed and the Minamoto, 
Heike, Fujiwara, and Tachibana families, the four families of 
nobility during the Heian era, controlled the arms of the 
warriors. In other words, power politics is their family 
profession. This faculty is genetically transmitted into 
Hosokawa's body. 
  Hosokawa's cabinet is a collection of members from the eight 
parties that form the ruling coalition. Troublesome members are 
assembled in full force to the right and to the left. On parade 
are the big and small taskmasters, such as the SDPJ's Yamahana, 
minister in charge of political reform; Shinseito's Hata, deputy 
prime minister and concurrently foreign minister; Komeito's 
Ishida, Director of the Management and Coordination Agency; 
DSP's Ouchi, minister of health and welfare; United Socialist 
Democratic Party's Eda, minister of science and technology, etc. 
  But Hosokawa does not appear to be intimidated at all. He 
proudly occupies the seat of honor with composure. While holding 
the balance of power, he adroitly manipulates the bunch of 
crafty veterans. This is showmanship that can hardly be 
performed by a 55-year-old, fair-complexioned prime minister. 
This is probably attributable, after all, to his family lineage 
and blueblood background. 
  The weakness of the coalition government lies in the 
contradictions of the basic policies of the respective parties 
of the ruling coalition. Should the eight parties express their 
individual views arbitrarily to the Hosokawa cabinet, the 
government would not last even a day. That is why the Hosokawa 
cabinet, before its inauguration, agreed to have the various 
parties shelve all of their inherent policies and for the time 
being to succeed the policies of the LDP government. This is 
where one can see the wonders of the art of rule by division, 
which is Hosokawa's ancestral inheritance. 
<H3>  Kono Seized Presidency With Party in Prostration From Loss 
of Political Power </H3>
  With the loss of political power, the LDP's Kono is 
experiencing difficulties. Kono stood at the forefront during 
interpellations at the recent special Diet session and staged a 
man-to-man debate with Hosokawa. The arguments were crisp and 
articulate, and the orations were excellent, but the content 
lacked appeal. This is because the idea of censuring Hosokawa in 
effect is tantamount to criticizing the LDP. This is the merit 
of Hosokawa following up with the LDP policies intact--borrowing 
a little of the techniques formulated by the LDP with hard work, 
neutralizing quarrels among fellow members of the ruling 
coalition, and with suppressing attacks made by the LDP. One 
must marvel at Hosokawa indeed, killing two birds with one stone 
in the manner of the court nobility. 
  But Kono, who is burning with determination to overthrow the 
Hosokawa cabinet even for a day sooner and to recapture the 
reins of government, cannot falter with these occurrences. As 
soon as feasible, he is ready to shoot his second arrow and his 
third arrow. One of his arrows is the tactic of exposing 
scandals. Resorting to money and women as weapons in political 
warfare is somewhat low-grade. Crudely waged, they could turn 
into mudslinging. The opponents can be wounded, but likewise the 
attacker can be wounded. But if effectiveness is expected even 
so, then resorting to dirty tactics is the practice of this 
political world. As a matter of fact, the Uno cabinet fell 
because of a woman, and boss Kanemaru's downfall was caused by 
money. 
  Kono has openly declared that, "Even if it is wrong, the LDP 
will not resort to delaying tactics." But rumors on the 
suppression of a project team to expose scandals, which was 
reported to have been secretly formed in the LDP, have not been 
heard. 
  Even from now, Hosokawa and Kono will mutually muster all 
their resources and they are fated to engage in mortal combat 
with all their might. If Hosokawa is not an ordinary person, 
then Kono too is not an ordinary person. The rivalry between 
these two people will probably be the big battle that will 
highlight the political history of the Heisei era. 
  Properly speaking, Kono was in a position to commit harakiri 
along with Miyazawa. This is the role of the chief cabinet 
secretary who is considered to be the guardian of the cabinet. 
But instead of following Miyazawa and resigning, Kono overpassed 
him to seize the presidency. 
  This does not mean that the LDP lacked a successor. 
Previously battling Miyazawa for the presidency and emerging as 
second and third choices are former Foreign Minister Watanabe 
and former Policy Research Council Chairman Mitsuzuka, 
respectively. Especially Watanabe, although in poor health, was 
extremely enthusiastic and chose to run in the recent 
presidential election. While fully aware of such transactions 
within the party, Kono hurled a written challenge. Then he 
gathered the votes of the young leaders of the various factions 
to defeat Watanabe and rose to assume the top position. 
  During this time, the LDP was defeated in the general 
election, lost its political power, and found itself in a form 
of prostration. It was almost like the Japanese people right 
after the end of World War II. The young leaders were knocked 
into a state of shock and they became a nearly hysterical group. 
In such an atmosphere, the extreme theory of old is bad and new 
is good prevails. Kono took advantage of this theory. But it 
must be said once again that Kono is a tremendous soldier of 
fortune. 
  If Hosokawa is Nobunaga, then Kono is, for the present, 
Tenichibo. Even Tenichibo, who sought to usurp the throne by 
pretending to be the illegitimate child of Yoshimune, the eighth 
Tokugawa shogun, alas, failed when his disguise was revealed by 
the penetrating eyes of the famous judge, Echizen no Kami Ooka. 
This then means that there is no Echizen Ooka of the Heisei era. 
  Although Hosokawa and Kono are on opposite camps right now, 
they were like-minded friends in the past. Besides that, they 
are dove politicians of the same mind. In that sense, for them 
to be glaring at each other is said to be rather unnatural. Some 
day, around the second act of the reorganization of the 
political world, it might come about that these two will 
unexpectedly join hands. 
  In 1976, along with six of his "foolishly honest" 
colleagues, 
Kono bolted from the LDP and they were entrenched as the 
Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club. Actually Hosokawa was supposed to 
join this foolishly honest group. Hosokawa was an upper house 
member of the Tanaka faction and held the position of 
parliamentary vice minister of finance. Although members of 
different factions, with Hosokawa in the Tanaka faction and Kono 
in the Nakasone faction, their minds were the same. Kono never 
doubted and believed that Hosokawa would cooperate with each 
other to the end. But just before taking the resolute step, 
Hosokawa had a change of heart. This meant that Kono was 
betrayed. 
  This sort of event occurred, but the thoughts of Hosokawa 
and 
Kono even today are running on the same track. For instance, 
regarding the Constitution, both of them stand on the side of 
protecting the Constitution. 
  Some day in the very near future, when Japan is faced with 
the inevitable selection of either revising the Constitution or 
protecting it and when this indeed becomes the time to test for 
the reorganization of the political world, then surely this will 
be the time when these two will likely take the same action. 
There is no guarantee to say that this prediction will not occur. 
<H3>  Neither Hosokawa Nor Kono Are Substantively Compatible With 
Ozawa </H3>
  The person to appear on the stage with open arms to shout 
"wait" is Ozawa. He is an entirely different person from 
Hosokawa and Kono. In short, if Hosokawa and Kono are of the 
dove faction, then Ozawa is certainly of the hawk faction. There 
is no compromise between the two factions. 
  Ozawa presently stands beside Hosokawa and has an enemy 
relationship with Kono. But, naturally, Ozawa cannot get along 
substantively with Kono, the enemy, nor with Hosokawa, the ally. 
But there is a pipeline running between Ozawa and Hosokawa. If 
Hosokawa will manage the cabinet, then Ozawa will administer the 
party. There is no reason they cannot discuss matters with each 
other and when they do, their feelings are conveyed. It is 
ironic that the two of them, from the dove and hawk factions, 
are presently in the honeymoon stage. 
  It is said that heroes understand the spirit of heroes, or 
should it be that snakes follow the way of the snakes, but these 
two people mutually respect the other's strength. Hosokawa has 
highly evaluated Ozawa ceaselessly as a man of actions, not 
words. The notion that there has never been any case, especially 
of secret talks being leaked by Ozawa's mouth, appears to have 
been a fresh experience for the first time for Hosokawa in his 
life up to now. And there is another point, that of Hosokawa 
having a feeling of respect for Ozawa's sense of direction. The 
new leaders of the LDP, which Hosokawa had previously associated 
with, were all nothing but competent managers of the factions. 
From among them, Ozawa alone stood out as being different. Not 
only did he possess farsighted intelligence, he has a kind of 
clear sense of direction about the era. Although this sense of 
direction is not necessarily the same as that for Hosokawa, at 
any rate Hosokawa respects Ozawa for having this sense of 
direction. 
  Ozawa too has not forgotten to praise Hosokawa. Ozawa has 
applauded Hosokawa's trait of resoluteness. Ozawa had previously 
served under former Prime Minister Kaifu and had cooperated with 
former Prime Minister Miyazawa. During those periods, the 
biggest ordeals were the lack of resoluteness at a time when 
these two people should have been resolute. And because of this 
indecisiveness, there is no way of knowing to what extent Ozawa 
moved about busily with pressure of work. In comparison with 
these two men, Hosokawa makes quick decisions that are 
unbecoming of his countenance. Moreover, he follows through with 
his decisions. These are traits that should definitely become 
primary qualifications for anyone who becomes a leader. Ozawa 
has spoken so in praise of Hosokawa. 
  The fact is that both of them flatter each other. But no 
matter how many cheers are exchanged on the surface, parts of 
the heterogeneity of the two people have clashed at the root of 
the relationship between them, with sparks flying. The first 
instance was the battle waged by the two people in the selection 
of personnel for the cabinet Secretariat during the formation of 
the cabinet, but it ended in total defeat for Ozawa. Candidates 
proposed by Ozawa were rejected totally by Hosokawa and the 
Secretariat was packed with pro-Hosokawa members, such as 
Takemura as chief cabinet secretary, Hatoyama as the deputy, and 
Tanaka as a special assistant. Ozawa's nominees were completely 
shut out. 
  Furthermore, regarding the combined small constituency and 
proportional representation electoral system and the political 
party furtherance legislation, the plan compiled at the party 
under Ozawa's supervision has been either rejected or revised by 
Takemura of the Prime Minister's Residence. Needless to say, 
Takemura has Hosokawa's support. 
  But at this point, Ozawa did not assume a defiant attitude 
to 
retaliate. But this does not mean that Ozawa's position was 
weakened from the standpoint of power relationship. Should Ozawa 
turn defiant, the Hosokawa cabinet will fall. Then everything 
will be lost. If Ozawa has done some calculating, that is all 
there is to it. 
<H3>  Ozawa's Strength and Talent To Lead Ruling Coalition's 
Representatives Council Are Excellent </H3>
  There are more serious problems than those described above. 
They are the differences in the thinking of the two people on 
the concept of government leadership. Hosokawa has in mind a 
coalition government based on a moderate multiparty 
organization, frankly, for a fixed, long-term Hosokawa 
government. Against this way of thinking, Ozawa's ideal is for a 
confrontation of a two-party system that would suffice in 
sustaining political power and that can field alternate 
governments. 
  But it appears that the two of them are only engaged in 
words. Deep examination and rich experience on the realities of 
the situation are lacking. In the past, Japan had multiparty 
coalition governments. In prewar days, there was the three-party 
cabinet to protect the constitution, consisting of the Kensei, 
Seiyu, and Kakushin parties; and in the postwar days, the 
Katayama and Ashida cabinets which consisted of three parties, 
namely, Socialist, Democratic, and Kokkyo parties. All of them 
were short-lived and died by the wayside. 
  Also the period from the Taisho era to the beginning of the 
Showa era was called the "Taisho democracy," which was the 
golden era of party politics. There was the confrontation of the 
two big parties, the Seiyu and Minsei parties, which alternately 
took over the reins of government. But in order to rise in 
power, they resorted to any means, hook or crook; used national 
policies on diplomacy and national defense as subjects for 
political warfare and mutually exposed scandals of the opponents 
to wage mudslinging battles. The people became disgusted and the 
military gained power. These developments were connected to lead 
to the tragedy of the Pacific war. 
  Apart from Europe, the multiparty organization or the 
confrontation of two large parties in Japan have facets which 
are not suited to the character of the people. Therefore in that 
respect, the actual performance of the LDP's independent 
government under the medium constituency district system must be 
reviewed all over. No matter how good the government, it is 
bound to deteriorate from the bottom because of a prolonged stay 
in power. There are numerous examples that have occurred 
throughout the world. The LDP government was not an exception. 
The series of corruption cases under the LDP government were not 
lies. But it is not fair to discredit the LDP government itself. 
  Were it not for the LDP independent cabinets, such events as 
the Japan- Soviet negotiations during the Hatoyama cabinet; the 
Okinawa reversion during the Sato cabinet; the Sino-Japanese 
negotiations during the Tanaka cabinet, and the introduction of 
the consumption tax that was carried through the four cabinets 
of Ohira, Suzuki, Nakasone, and Takeshita, would probably not 
have been realized. Also, the national budget was 1 trillion yen 
during the Hatoyama cabinet, but it exceeded 70 trillion yen 
during the Miyazawa cabinet. This means that the country's 
strength increased 70 times in a 38-year span. Even after 
subtracting inflation increases, having a stable government and 
continued policies under an independent cabinet are adequate 
merits. 
  The fact is that here lies the foundation for recapturing 
the 
government by the LDP, which Kono is aiming for. 
  Ozawa says "no" to this and is putting a stop to it, but on 
second thought, Ozawa is as shrewd and headstrong as Hosokawa 
and Kono. Only recently during the latter part of the Miyazawa 
cabinet reign, Ozawa was in the middle of being forsaken by 
everyone and was on the verge of surely being tortured to death. 
  Anyhow, he was summoned as a Diet witness by the minority 
parties regarding the Sagawa Kyubin case and about the Kominto, 
and he was surrounded by the majority party's Executive 
Committee, centering on then Secretary General Kajiyama. Ozawa 
caught hell coming and going, and he was pushed to the wall. 
  Then in the turmoil of the series of events, that is the 
passage of the no-confidence motion, dissolution of the lower 
house, and the general election, Ozawa, before he realized it, 
found himself in the minority party camp and in reverse was 
flaunting the LDP. There is no need to say that one must marvel 
at this quick change from one ruling party to another ruling 
coalition. Indeed he is deserving of the nickname of Nezumi Kozo 
[Robin Hood] of the Heisei era. 
  Nezumi Kozo was not simply a robber. He was known throughout 
the country as a chivalrous robber and he was a friend of the 
common people. Thus, to this day he is popularly remembered. And 
for the spirit of chivalry and elusiveness in actions, to liken 
Ozawa as a Nezumi Kozo is not too far from hitting the mark. 
Except that from the standpoint of popularity, Ozawa has areas 
that are far short of Nezumi Kozo. This is the point Ozawa must 
reflect on. 
  Setting aside popularity, Ozawa's strength and talent are 
excellent, more so than in the past. At any rate, because the 
ruling coalition is an assembly of different groups, it is 
without a central point. If there is such a thing, it would be 
the ruling coalition's Representatives Council. It would be the 
equivalent of the LDP's Executive Council and the SDPJ's Central 
Executive Committee. The person who controls the Representatives 
Council also controls the Hosokawa cabinet. It may be safe to 
say so. As a matter of fact, the person leading this 
Representatives Council is Ozawa. 
  The Representatives Council is comprised of personnel at the 
secretary-general level of the ruling coalition. When one 
mentioned the secretary general of the previous minority 
parties, a feeling of fearfulness pervaded. When the SDPJ's 
Secretary General Akamatsu, Komeito's Secretary General 
Ichikawa, and DSP's Secretary General Yonezawa lined up, anyone 
would probably be overwhelmed by their imposing figures and 
strong appeal. But then, Ozawa is not overwhelmed one bit. On 
the contrary, as the associations increase, he has come to rise 
as the central figure in the Representatives Council. Right now, 
the pattern is one of Ozawa sitting pretty in the center, and 
Ichikawa and Yonezawa waiting on him on both sides. Akamatsu is 
being used as an errand boy by Ozawa. Ichikawa shows no respect 
for Akamatsu, and the atmosphere is one in which Yonezawa teases 
Akamatsu with such statements as "bring your credentials from 
the party." 
  It was said of Ozawa that he was respected only because of 
Kanemaru. The fact that he could show a big face in the LDP was 
possible only because Kanemaru existed in the background. If 
severed from his relationship with Kanemaru, Ozawa would be 
easily blown away with one stroke. This sort of view was evident 
from around that time. So now Kanemaru is gone and Ozawa is by 
himself. This same Ozawa has plunged in the midst of the 
veterans of the former minority parties, without being 
overpowered and without flinching, and far from being an equal 
match, he has become the bully. After all, there is no reason 
why Ozawa's true capability cannot be recognized. 
  In this manner, there is Hosokawa in the Japan New Party, 
Kono in the LDP, and Ozawa in Shinseito, with each party not 
lacking personnel. In comparison with this situation, what is 
pathetic is the SDPJ. Although it is the number-one party within 
the ruling coalition, it ranks the lowest from the standpoint of 
personnel. 
  Yamahana resigned to take the responsibility of the party's 
crushing defeat in the general election, but regarding the 
process of his resignation and the selection of Murayama as his 
successor, various SDPJ personnel were reviewed, but none of 
them were considered to be high caliber. It appears that, since 
the days of Suehiro Nishio and Saburo Eda, the SDPJ has run out 
of outstanding personnel. In such a situation, the reference as 
the leading party of the ruling coalition will cry. Nay, not 
only will it cry. Its very name might be snuffed out.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Ozawa was once asked for a definition of "a normal 
nation," and he described the conditions as "not expressing its 
dislikes or saying anything merely to suit its own convenience." 
However, Ozawa himself appears to be acting at his or his 
party's own convenience. Before aiming for an ordinary nation, 
Ozawa should perhaps strive to become "a normal person" who can 
be understood by the people. 
<H5>  Parting With the SDPJ Is Inevitable </H5>
  The Hosokawa administration, which appeared to be sailing 
smoothly after its inauguration, is now showing conspicuous 
signs of fraying. In addition to a mounting offensive by the LDP 
[Liberal Democratic Party] which overcame its danger of 
refracturing, loud noises of discord are heard from within the 
coalition. The source is none other than the existence and the 
conspicuous statements and behavior of representative Ichiro 
Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. 
  First of all, the political reform bill is vitally important 
to the coalition administration. The solidarity among the SDPJ 
[Social Democratic Party of Japan] upper house members who 
oppose the bill has strengthened with time. At the outset, Ozawa 
used his close associate, upper house member Sadao Hirano, to 
try to persuade the rebelling group. He reportedly even dangled 
the bait of cabinet posts to the hardline faction of Dietman 
Osamu Yatabe, et al. However, he is said to have switched his 
direction by stating: "It is now impossible to change their 
minds. There are 15 or 16 persons with whom we cannot 
communicate. The party cadres are also opposed at heart to 
reform. The SDPJ is beyond our reach. There is nothing we can do 
if a defeat in the upper house results in dissolution and a 
general election." 
  He also spoke to his associates as follows. "If an election 
results, both the SDPJ and the LDP will definitely split. 
Because the tail wind has died down and organization is lacking, 
the JNP [Japan New Party] and Sakigake [Harbinger] Party will 
not increase their seats. The only winners will be Shinseito and 
Komeito. These two and the JNP should unite, embrace the LDP 
reformist faction, and form a major force. If Hosokawa's 
popularity should wane at that point, we can set up Hata (deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister). They enjoy similar 
popularity among the people." 
  This is interpreted to be a clear cutoff of the SDPJ. 
  Nonetheless, given the fact that he considers even Prime 
Minister Hosokawa as one of his chess pawns, Ozawa's dictatorial 
demeanor is apalling. 
  Of course, the SDPJ does not remain silent. Diet Affairs 
Committee chairman Koken Nosaka, who met with Ozawa on 29 
November, reportedly said in rage to those around him after the 
meeting as follows. "We fear neither a dissolution of the 
coalition government nor an election. We endured political 
reform to a certain extent, but if an opening of the rice market 
and a rise in the consumption tax are forced down our throats in 
the name of maintaining the coalition, our party will be dealt 
an early death. We can make a breakthrough by striking out." 
  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama is also reported to have 
conducted 
secret liaison with "don" Seiroku Kajiyama, former secretary 
general and a conservative member of the LDP. The SDPJ's 
anti-Shinseito, anti-Ozawa posture is becoming more pronounced. 
  The trend was accelerated by the "constitutional revision 
statement" made by Defense Agency Director General Keisuke 
Nakanishi on 1 December. While explaining it as his personal 
view at a lecture in Tokyo, Nakanishi made an extremely 
provocative statement for an incumbent director general of the 
Defense Agency. "I feel that it is ridiculous to continue to 
adhere zealously to a Constitution of a half-century ago. We 
should remake it to respond to realistic standards while 
respecting the spirit of constitutionalism. I am speaking with 
conviction. I am prepared to resign at any time." 
  Actually, Nakanishi resigned as the director general the 
following day, because the resulting confusion caused a halt in 
the supplementary budget deliberations. Nonetheless, it was a 
well-known fact that the crux of the Nakanishi statement was the 
same as Ozawa's longstanding argument. A commentary was even 
leaked by a Shinseito affiliate that "it was Ozawa's farewell 
declaration to the SDPJ." 
  SDPJ upper house member Masatoshi Ito says with heated 
indignation: "It is outrageous. It was a mistake, after all, to 
team up with Shinseito. The Nakanishi statement was actually 
Ozawa's statement, and this clarifies the fact that the party 
advocates a power state. The SDPJ cannot relinquish its party 
spirit of protecting the Constitution. We must sever our ties 
with the coalition government as soon as possible." 
  Upper house member Masao Kunihiro similarly declares in a 
harsh tone: "If Ozawa continues to try to push through his 
unreasonable demands, it will result in Ozawa's one-man control 
which is worse than the LDP's one-party domination. We must not 
allow it to happen. Cabinet members, including Director Eda of 
the Science &amp; Technology Agency (United Social Democratic 
Party 
[USDP] representative), should leave the coalition, and I 
believe that they will." 
  There are also voices from within Sakigake [Harbinger] party 
ranks that fear Shinseito's constitutional reform posture, and 
the Hosokawa administration has suddenly begun to careen because 
of the single Ozawa faction. 
<H3>  "All Right for Budget Formation To Be Postponed Until Next 
Year" </H3>
  Ozawa is also committing mistakes in the aspect of business 
stimulus measures. 
  He has spoken frequently to his close associates as follows. 
"The people are overly absorbed with the immediate future. They 
should persevere longer for the time being. It is necessary for 
the politicians to take the leadership and guide the people by 
displaying that leadership. A system for that purpose must be 
established." 
  At the root of Ozawa's thinking is the idea that "government 
by the foolish masses" will result by listening to the people's 
voice, and what is necessary is a politician with strong 
leadership who can lead the foolish masses that tend to be 
"overly engrossed with the near future." However, as an 
extension of such a concept arises a contention to "postpone 
antirecession measures" that holds contempt for the people. 
  For example, we quote a paragraph from his address before 
the 
Aichi Prefectural League on 25 November. "There are requests for 
us to do something about the recession. Although the government 
has taken various steps, there is no indication of an 
improvement because it is a structural recession. The previous 
concepts will not work. In order to execute drastic monetary and 
fiscal measures, a prerequisite is to reform politics itself. 
Therefore, political reform must precede antirecession measures." 
  He also stated clearly to a leading politician: "In order to 
pass a political reform bill, a broad extension of the Diet 
session is necessary. For that purpose, it is inevitable that 
the formulation of the budget be postponed until next year." 
  Of course, the content of what is called political reform 
here refers to electoral system reform which is often debated as 
being problematical. Nonetheless, his nerve in declaring that 
the antirecessional measures, which everyone argues loudly today 
as a most urgent task, "can be postponed until after political 
reform," and to also postpone the formulation of next year's 
draft fiscal budget including the income tax reduction 
anticipated at the earliest by the people, cannot be imagined of 
the leader of a responsible government and ruling party. 
  However, like boss, like subordinate. Facing the executives 
of the Japan Department Stores Assn who came to petition for an 
early antirecession measure, Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] Minister Hiroshi Kumagae, Ozawa's close 
associate, declared: "First, we must pass political reform. 
After that, we will push through a business stimulus measure 
with a bang." 
  The petitioners were reportedly aghast at the lighthearted 
use of the term "with a bang." Meanwhile, the stock prices which 
reacted against the Kumagae remark fell below the 16,000 yen 
level with a loud "bang." As such, no insensitive remark could 
make amends. 
  "Although the Hosokawa administration is said to be a 
political reform administration, it is a big mistake to say that 
reform is all it has to do. The present national task is 
business stimulation and, unless you start by coping with it, 
politics will be unnecessary" (LDP Dietman Shinji Sato). 
  This remark does not cast a damper on the government, but it 
is a fair argument that castigates it. However, Ozawa's apparent 
disinclination to heed it is clear in his aforementioned address. 
  Professor Setsuo Takahata of Teikyo University's economic 
dept comments as follows. "Japan's economy is said to be 
first-rate, but its politics is ridiculed as being third-rate. 
However, at the present rate, its economics could also become 
third-rate. Although Mr. Ozawa has offered various proposals for 
Japan's future, his remark indicates his absolute lack of 
knowledge about its current economic state. His continued stress 
on a 10-percent consumption tax as a source of tax reduction 
also has a reverse effect on the consumer mind which has 
continued to cool. Speaking of tax reduction, it could have been 
done in the summer at a cost of 5 trillion yen. Now, it will not 
be effective unless it is about 10 trillion yen. This is not 
merely economic tone-deafness, but economic ignorance. The 
economy will not improve within this century with Mr. Ozawa's 
awareness level." 
<H5>  Cultivation of Zoku Dietmen Aimed Toward Money and Votes </H5>
  There are other problematical and quesionable statements. 
The 
Ozawa statement about rice goes as follows. "I have not said 
that rice must be deregulated. However, tariffication is a 
principle of free trade which Japan does not negate." 
  His intent is not clear, but he seems to say, in essence, 
that rice importation is inevitable in order to maintain 
friendly relations with the other nations of the world. If so, 
why does he fail to debate it seriously among the coalition 
parties, and merely stacks up established facts in a manner that 
bewitches the people? It is only natural for the SDPJ to 
increasingly react and claim that it is contrary to the public 
commitments made by the eight factions when they formed the 
coalition. 
  "In effect, only Shinseito's future exists in Ozawa's eyes. 
The future image of Japan, of which he speaks, is also merely a 
future image with the condition that Shinseito becomes the focus 
of politics" (an LDP leader). 
  Ozawa's comments are dangerous and unreliable to the point 
that such views have a sound of credibility. For example, he has 
stated about the LDP, his alma mater, as follows. "The LDP is 
like a large tree at which one looks up, but it is hollow 
inside. Therefore, forming Shinseito was inevitable" (from his 
aforementioned address in Aichi). 
  We will not question here who was responsible for the 
hollowing out of the LDP. However, if he had bolted from the 
party based on such a judgment, it is the normal sentiment among 
the people to want him to cleanly discard all LDP-style methods 
and senses. 
  However, the collection of funds goes on as usual, and 
political methods have not changed. For example, Shinseito 
recently successively formed "research committees" completely 
similar to those of the LDP and increased the number of petition 
windows. "In effect, the intention is to gather votes and money 
by looking after their special- interests organizations that no 
longer go to the LDP with their petitions. They are aiming at 
mass cultivation of the zoku Dietmen" (a Japan New Party Diet 
member). 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa, who has sought to eliminate the 
zoku 
Diet members, has reportedly expressed displeasure concerning 
this trend. 
  When the mass media criticized this, he (Ozawa) incorrigibly 
refused to reconsider, but conversely criticized the mass media, 
saying: "Various problems are aired in the mass media, but the 
mass media is arbitrarily using names to do business. I do not 
want you to misunderstand, because they are not reporting the 
truth" (from his Aichi address). 
<H5>  No One Gives Advice to Ozawa </H5>
  Moreover, since 8 November, he has refused to hold any 
scheduled press conference, which he himself originally began 
with the foreign press and magazines allowed to attend, on the 
pretext of "a divergence of views between the mass media." 
Although there was a plethora of pending bills, including those 
on political reform, rice and the budget regarding which he 
should have explained to the people in press conferences as the 
representative of a public political party, he makes no attempt 
to do so. If he shows up at a press conference, he will be 
questioned about the unexplained portion of his own nebulously 
acquired funds. He cannot avoid the suspicion that he is evading 
the questioning. 
  An Ozawa associate comments on this problem. "Well, Mr. 
Ozawa's contention is probably that `there is any number of ways 
other than a press conference to communicate to the people,' but 
actually there has there been no increase in TV appearances or 
local appearances by him. His true feeling is: `What is wrong 
with not talking if I do not wish to talk?' There are some 
within Shinseito who believe it is wrong. However, they are 
afraid and do not dare give him advice. They can only be 
yes-men, because they know that, if they resist him, they will 
be thrown out." 
  LDP Dietman Yoshinobu Shimamura makes the following critical 
comment. "It has been made clear that his `open press 
conference' was a lie. Ozawa thinks that he can do anything to 
form a political system which he can control himself. It is too 
obvious. He exposed his true self by his refusal to hold any 
press conference. Although he says that he will lay out 
antirecession measures, he only thinks of using it to pass 
political reform, and there is no reason to expect an honest 
measure." 
  Without an honest antirecession measure, without obtaining 
any consensus within the ruling coalition on rice deregulation, 
and finally under circumstances where the SDPJ could leave the 
coalition, the Hosokawa administrative has suddenly become 
unsettled. Materialization of the political reform bill, which 
is the major public commitment by the Hosokawa administration, 
seems to be difficult not only within the year, but even if the 
Diet sessiion is drastically extended. 
  The Nakanishi statement on constitutional amendment has not 
only given the LDP an excuse for attack, but also polarized the 
divergence of basic doctrines that previously existed among the 
ruling parties, and has impressed the public with the protusion 
by Shinseito. 
  If Ozawa should seriously cut off the SDPJ, the collapse and 
dissolution of the coalition and a general election will result. 
During this recession, a political vacuum exceeding a month will 
recur due to conflicting party interests. It is the presumptuous 
behavior of such men in power that has marred this nation.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, February 8 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- At the 
invitation of the Indian President Sh. D. Sharma, the Government 
of the Kingdom of Thailand, the Lao President Nouhak Phoumsavan, 
the chairman of the SRV Le Duc Anh the President of Mongolia P. 
Ochirbat will be on an official visit to India in February 
21-25, the Kingdom of Thailand in February 25-28, the LPDR from 
February 28 up to March 3, the SRV in March 3-6, the Ministry 
for External Relations of Mongolia informed today. 
  The government and people of Laos will welcome President of 
Mongolia P. Ochirbat and those accompanying him during his visit 
to be paid to the Lao People's Democratic Republic considering 
the current visit as an important historical landmark in the 
relationship of the two countries i.e. Laos and Mongolia in the 
period of the transition to market relations. This visit is to 
promote raising of prestige of Mongolia in the South-Eastern 
Asia as a whole region being regarded as a region characterized 
by progressive social and economic development and a political 
stability as well, underlined in connection with the forthcoming 
visit of the Mongolian president to this country. 
  As was said by the Ambassador of Laos to Mongolia Mr. 
Chaleng 
Varinthrasak, the two countries and peoples from time immemorial 
have established traditionally good relations. Mongolia and 
Laos have exchanged visits of their leaders rendering mutual 
assistance and support both in the cause of defence and 
strengthening of their countries and on the international scene. 
The "friendship" hospital and the cattle breeding farm built 
for residents of the Province of Siengkhuang are symbolizing the 
friendly relations of the two countries. At present the 
cooperation in the spheres of economy, trade, and culture should 
be promoted which is nowadays more needed than whenever taking 
into account the possibilities of the two sides being based on 
the principles of equality and mutual benefit, the ambassador 
noted. 
  In late February of the current year the Mongolian president 
is likely to pay official visits to such countries as India, 
Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.

  [Text] Thailand yesterday agreed to set up border task 
forces with Burma and Laos to improve the efficiency of local 
officials from the three countries in their joint campaign 
against illegal drugs trade. 
  Narcotics Control Board Secretary General, Chaowalit 
Yotmani, 
said the Thai-Burmese and Thai-Lao border task forces would 
enable anti-narcotics officials to take immediate action to 
prevent and suppress the production and trafficking of narcotics 
without having to wait for the decision of the governments of 
the respective countries. 
  The task forces would also make way for the improvement of 
intelligence operations and a better flow of information about 
drug traffickers among Thai Lao and Burmese officials, Pol Gen 
Chaowalit said. 
  Agreements on the border task forces were reached at 
yesterday's second ministerial-level meeting on drugs prevention 
and suppression in Rangoon which was attended by top government 
leaders and senior officials of Thailand, Laos and Burma. 
  The Thai task forces will be headed by Narcotics Suppression 
Bureau commissioner Somchai Milindarangkun. Pol Lt Gen Somchai 
said the first meeting of Thai and Burmese officials will be 
held in Chiang Rai's Mae Sai District opposite Burma's border 
town of Tachilek in March, to work out joint drugs prevention 
and suppression plans. The date of the meeting with Laos has 
not yet been scheduled but the venue will be in the northeastern 
province of Nong Khai, he said. 
  Pol Lt Gen Somchai conceded that coordinating efforts with 
Burma was likely to be more difficult than working with Laos as 
Thailand and Laos have already been close to one another and 
have always exchanged information. He said Thailand should 
strengthen its cooperation with Burma 90 both sides can have a 
common understanding and trust one another. 
  "Trust in each other would help boost efficiency in our 
attempt to get updated information that would lead to the arrest 
of drug traffickers," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Pol Gen Chaowalit said Thailand and Burma would 
also hold a discussion on problems about minority groups along 
their common border because some of these groups have been 
involved in narcotics production. He said the three countries 
also agreed that meetings of their senior anti-drugs officials 
would be held twice a year and a ministerial-level meeting once 
every two years. Cooperation would also be sought from China 
and Vietnam and these two countries will be invited to join in 
the next meeting, he said. 
  Thailand earlier pledged to provide training assistance 
under 
18 drug prevention and suppression projects to Burma and Lao 
officials between 1994 and 1996 at a cost of 8.2 million baht. 
  The meeting, which ends today, will be wrapped up with the 
signing of a joint declaration on narcotics suppression 
cooperation by Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan, Burma's 
Interior Minister Mya Than and Laotian PM's Office Minister Phao 
Bounaphon. 
  A joint declaration on the elimina tion of narcotics and 
drug 
trafficking in the region was signed at the first 
ministerial-level meeting in Bangkok in 1992.

  [Text] Laos, Myanmar [Burma], and Thailand called on the 
international community to render sponsorship and technical and 
financial assistance and cooperation to fight narcotics 
problems. The appeal was contained in the joint declaration 
issued at the second ministerial-level meeting on cooperation on 
the control of drug abuse between Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand 
which concluded on Wednesday. 
  The joint declaration said: The three nations are deeply 
concerned with the unprecedented and alarming spread of narcotic 
drug abuse in all regions of the world, thus causing long-term 
adverse effects on the users themselves as well as on their 
families. 
  The three sides unanimously agreed that coordination is 
needed at three levels -- national, regional, and sub-regional. 
The three countries agreed that the ministerial-level meeting 
on cooperation on controlling drug abuse should be held every 
two years to review progress of cooperation and to map out 
future cooperation plans. Senior officials on drug control from 
these countries will hold a meeting at least once a year to 
consult about the trends of drug use and trafficking as well as 
measures to suppress this problem. 
  The next ministerial-level meeting of the three countries 
will be held in Laos in 1996.

the prospect of a trade war. The two countries are in dispute 
over American access to the Japanese market with Japan resisting 
a push by the United States for specific targets. 
  Australia says it favors any opening of the Japanese market, 
but is opposed to any managed trade targets. Trade Minister Bob 
McMullan says Australia has been monitoring events through its 
embassies and Tokyo. 
  [Begin McMullan recording] I have issued an instruction to 
both embassies to reiterate Australia's concerns to those

about how a dispute that both sides regard as important, but I 
don't think it is beyond the capacity to resolve it. [end

  [Text] Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating says new 
report of further killings following the 1991 massacre in Dili 
in East Timor will be raised with the Indonesian Government by 
Australia's ambassador in Jakarta. 
  A British television documentary released this week claims 
many survivors of the Dili massacre were later killed by 
Indonesian troops as they lay in hospital beds. Mr. Keating 
says the Australian Government will seek further information 
from the Indonesian foreign minister on the claim. The 
Australian journalist, John Pilger, has claimed in a new 
documentary that a form of genocide has been going on in East 
Timor for 18 years. In the documentary called Death of a 
Nation, Mr. Pilger, alleges there were three massacres in Dili 
in 1991. Unidentified people in the film claim they were 
tortured by the Indonesian military. The film also shows 
footage of bones being unearthed from what is alleged to be a 
mass grave. Mr. Pilger said the film should provoke new 
condemnation of Indonesia and further investigation.

Armed Forces. Thailand is building a blue-water Navy and wants 
new rifles for its entire Army among other major acquisitions. 
Australian officials say deals with Thailand alone could be 
worth billions of dollars. Proximity and developing a balance 
of trade are seen as advantages in competing with bigger arms 
suppliers in the region. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] The people of Bougainville might be short of most 
essential items, but they have an increasing number of radio 
stations to listen to. The Wingti government is spending about 
$75,000 [Australian dollars] of Bougainville restoration program 
fund on setting up a government propaganda station, but as Sean 
Dorney reports, the station might be illegal. 
  [Begin Dorney recording] Bougainvillians already have one 
government-funded radio station to listen to -- Radio North 
Solomons -- run by the National Broadcasting Commission, the 
NBC, which has an independent charter somewhat similar to that 
of the ABC. But Radio North Solomons, which had to abandon its 
original facilities in Kieta in central Bougainville in 1990 and 
operated out of Ribaul until shifting back to Buka Island about 
a year ago, is apparently too independent for the Wingti 
government. 
  This new radio station, which is to be called Radio 
Bougainville, is going to be quite different to Radio North 
Solomons, according to the Papua New Guinea [PNG] Government's 
daily information release, BOUGAINVILLE TODAY. It says the new 
station's objectives will differ from the NBC's station in that 
it will enable the people to hear government news and, what it 
calls, awareness programs. The station is to be located at 
Loloho in central Bougainville -- not far from the areas of the 
island still under the control of the BRA, the Bougainville 
Revolutionary Army. 
  The BRA station, Radio Free Bougainville, has been a severe 
irritant to the government for quite some time now. It 
broadcasts rebel propaganda -- much of it wildly exaggerated 
accounts of military encounters in which the BRA inevitably 
killed the PNG troops, while its own men miraculously escaped 
injury. However, it does have some good sources in areas 
nominally back under PNG Government control, and occasionally 
causes the PNG military some embarrassment by revealing details 
of proposed military operations and even military briefings. 
  The idea of the government's station seems to be to counter 
that rebel propaganda. Needless to say, the NBC is not too 
happy about having a government-funded station competing with 
its Radio North Solomons, and the NBC chairman is in a position, 
at least on paper, to do something about it. Some years ago, 
the chairman, Sir (Okon Tololo), was given sole authority to 
approve or disapprove of any new radio station in PNG. He has 
not given his approval to the new government propaganda station. 
So, when it does go to air, unless the government provokes his 
present authority over such matters, the government's station 
won't be legal. [end recording]

  [Text] In Vanuatu, an election for the country's next

turn up for the vote. South Pacific correspondent, Erina 
Reddan, reports that the ballot which requires the two-thirds 
majority is a crucial test for the government. 
  [Begin Reddan recording] Chief Justice Charles d'Imecourts 
rescheduled the vote to Wednesday. Justice d'Imecourts said he 
would hold the absent electorate in contempt of court if they 
did not explain. However, the two opposition members, who were 
present, said the opposition had received no writs. Although 
the chief justice accepted this as an explanation, he said they 
would have known about the vote through the media, and that 
there was no political advantage from their action. 
  Meanwhile, the government's chance of having the two third 
majority it needs to elect the president is uncertain. The 
various opposition groups say they are about to sign a 
memorandum of understanding, bringing opposition numbers in the 
parliament up to 22, and they have hope of attracting defectors 
from the government ranks. 
  The government currently has 24 members. The opposition says 
it will renew its notice of no confidence vote in the prime 
minister. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] PORT VILA, Feb 11 (AFP) -- Striking public 
service workers threatened Friday to withdraw from Vanuatu's 
umbrella union council after four of their members were handed 
six-month suspended jail sentences. Vanuatu Public Service 
Association (VPSA) coordinator Joseph Watsuh said his union may 
pull out of the Vanuatu Council of Trade Unions (VCTU) because 
it had failed to support his members in court. 
  Watsuh said he was satisfied with the judgement of the 
Vanuatu Supreme Court but the union was disappointed no member 
of the VCTU had attended the hearing. "VCTU put us in a 
difficult situation, and it looks like they don't back us when 
we're in trouble", Watsuh said. [passage omitted] "We'll meet 
with the VPSA executive," Watsuh said, adding: "In the meantime, 
we might decide not to follow any more calls from the VCTU." 
  The four defendants sentenced Friday were among 50 arrested 
by police when violence broke out at a picket in a government 
building here on Tuesday after the VCTU called a general strike.

Law and Order Restoration Council, on the 47th anniversary of

[Rangoon] on 12 February -- read by announcer] 
  [Excerpts] Esteemed national brethren of the union: The 
12th of February 1994, the 47th anniversary of union day, is an 
auspicious occasion. Forty-seven years ago on this day, leaders 
of our national races were able to sign the Panglong agreement, 
the national unity and solidarity accord. The Panglong 
agreement, the result of national unity, became a source of 
strength for the anti-imperialist and national liberation 
struggle. [passage omitted] 
  Even now neocolonialists and their dependents are still 
making attempts using various tactics to manipulate and 
interfere in our internal affairs and to cause the 
disintegration of national unity. In such a situation, our 
national brethren must be vigilant in countering the 
neocolonialist threat. It is evident to all that the State Law 
and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], since the time it assumed 
responsibility, has been giving priority to the affairs of the 
national races while upholding the three main national causes: 
non-disintegration of the union, non-disintegration of national 
solidarity, and perpetuation of sovereignty. 
  In drawing up the new constitution, leading to a new 
democratic state, the national convention has also been able to 
formulate the basic principles which guarantee the unity and 
consolidation of the national races. It is also to be noted 
that the basic principles that guarantee the welfare of the 
national races are included in the 104 basic principles laid 
down by the national convention, which are to be framed in the 
new constitution. [passage omitted] 
  As all the national races know, the SLORC, with a view to 
forging a firm, solid national unity, has been extending an 
invitation to the armed groups in the jungle. It is the right 
time for the armed groups in the jungle to give up their armed 
struggle -- which is impeding the development of their own 
people --return to the legal fold with dignity, and work 
vigorously for the welfare of the union and their own people. 
[passage omitted] 
  I would hereby like to hope that all the national races will 
be able to work for the welfare of the union more extensively 
from the beginning of this significant and noble occasion of the 
47th anniversary of union day, while upholding the four 
objectives of the union day: to ensure the perpetuation of the 
union, to keep all the national races ever united, to involve 
all the national races in striving for the emergence of the 
state constitution, and to bring about the national development 
and the emergence of a peaceful, prosperous and modern nation.

  [Excerpts] Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, chairman of the 
Education Committee of Myanmar [Burma] and secretary-1 of the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], met and 
delivered an address to the rectors and principals of the 
universities, colleges, and institutes at a meeting hall of the 
Central Council of Universities of the Department of Higher 
Education at 1430 today. [passage omitted] 
  He said the rectors and principals of the universities, 
colleges, and institutes play an important role in making the 
education policy effective and helping the peaceful pursuit of 
education. To further the peaceful pursuit of education and to 
maintain discipline in students, he added, the teachers from 
colleges and universities were given refresher courses at the 
Institute of Public Service in Phaunggyi. He told the rectors 
and principals to oversee and implement the pragmatic use of 
experience and knowledge which the teachers had gained at the 
refresher courses. He also said that destructive elements were 
waiting in the wings, eyeing any weakness in the administration 
and management in order to disrupt the peaceful pursuit of 
education. That is why responsible personnel need to plan and 
to make arrangements on how it should be prevented. If a 
problem occurs, either big or small, the respective parties have 
to coordinate and present the matter to the higher authorities 
and resolve the problem at the same time. He added that 
teachers will achieve their goal if they always review the 
procedures of maintaining discipline for the peaceful pursuit of 
education and work under the management and supervision of the 
rectors and principals. He said students needed to be guided 
and progressively organized so that there would be better 
maintenance of discipline in the schools. The student youths as 
citizens also have a responsibility to respect the country's 
laws, regulations, and by-laws, which are respected by the 
public. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Larry Jagan from the "Current World Affairs" </F>
program] 
  [Excerpts] Dear Listeners: At the beginning of the week, 
the National League for Democracy [NLD], the opposition party in 
Burma, presented its views at the National Convention. In an 
80-page report, it expressed its view on each topic under 
discussion by nearly 700 delegates at the National Convention. 
[passage omitted] Government officials are now scrutinizing the 
NLD report before it can be presented by National Convention 
Chairman U Aung Toe. The NLD, which won a landslide victory 
with 80 percent of the votes in the 1990 general election, did 
not even get 20 percent of the delegate representation at the 
National Convention. Larry Jagan reports from Rangoon that some 
NLD members are putting pressure on their leaders to boycott the 
National Convention. 
  Dear Listeners: The NLD led by U Aung Shwe is now concerned 
about being deregistered. That is why it is certain that the 
NLD will not boycott the National Convention. In December, 
before the resumption of the National Convention, the 
authorities warned the leader of the NLD and one or two other 
opposition leaders that their parties will be deregistered if 
they boycott the National Convention. [passage omitted] Another 
NLD source believes that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, before being put 
under house arrest, told U Aung Shwe to work within the 
framework of the multiparty regulations. Now the delegates who 
support U Aung Shwe's position suggested that the NLD carry on 
with the present situation to allow the party to participate in 
the future election which will be held for sure once the new 
constitution is completed. At the same time, it is also true 
that there are many in the opposition movement who believe that 
the NLD will lose its credibility if it continues to do what is 
being directed by the rulers. They also believe that, as a 
result, the NLD will face the danger of losing the public 
support it amassed in the 1990 general election. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to the inner circle of the National Convention, 
many new suggestions are presented in the NLD report. Although 
the NLD has accepted the presidential system, it is still firm 
on its demands: The parliament must be sovereign and the 
president must be a representative elected by the people. The 
NLD source said the NLD has rejected the paragraph which says 
the president must be a national leader and proposed that the 
presidential candidate must be a highly educated person. 
According to the inner circle of the National Convention, the 
NLD also said that only representatives elected by the people 
must be in the electoral college, which is responsible for 
electing the president, and these representatives must by 
equally elected from the two chambers of the parliament. It is 
totally contradictory to what U Aung Toe, chairman of the 
National Convention Convening Work Committee, said during the 
resumption of the convention at the beginning of last month. In 
his speech, he said two-thirds of the electoral college, which 
is responsible for electing the president, is to be elected by 
the pyithuhluttaw representatives [parliamentarians], while the 
remaining one-third is to be elected by the commander-in-chief 
of the Defense Services. It is also mentioned that each chamber 
must elect one presidential candidate each while the third 
presidential candidate will be elected by the commander in chief 
of the Defense Services. Once the president is elected the 
remaining candidates will become vice presidents. If the 
president steps down, one of the vice presidents will be elected 
president. But the NLD said there should be only one president 
and one vice president, and it is still firm on its demand that 
both must be elected by the people. [passage omitted] 
  Rangoon residents believe that the military rulers are 
trying 
their best to complete the procedures of the National Convention 
as soon as possible. [Words indistinct] also believe that the 
Burmese Government has a great desire to make sure that the NLD 
participates in the National Convention until the completion of 
the constitution so that the NLD cannot blame the government for 
being excluded at the convention. A source close to the NLD 
says the NLD is actually trying to prolong National Convention 
procedures using delaying tactics. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Sufi Yusof] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Fri. [11 February] -- Malaysia is 
prepared to send additional troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina 
following the Organisation of Islamic Conference's [OIC] offer 
of 10,000 troops to beef up the United Nations peacekeeping 
contingent there. It is proposed that the troops will come from 
Malaysia, Jordan, Pakistan, and Egypt. Previously, the UN had 
asked for 7,600 troops from the OIC. [passage omitted] 
  Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said any 
additional troop deployment would have to be sanctioned by the 
world body. "We will abide by the decision of the OIC, but we 
must get the green light from the UN," he said in a telephone 
interview from his house here today. Najib was not surprised 
that the OIC Contact Group at its Jakarta meeting yesterday made 
the offer of additional troops. "The move to send additional 
troops from the OIC member countries is an on going discussion. 
"We have discussed this issue many times before and we are ready 
to offer more troops for UN duty in Bosnia." [passage omitted] 
  Malaysia has about 1,500 troops serving with the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) under the command of Kol. [Colonel] 
Hashim Hussein. 
  Asked about the total number of troops which Malaysia was 
willing to send to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Najib said it was 
premature to give a figure. However, Defence Ministry sources 
said Malaysia could send up to three battalions, but this would 
depend on logistical support. "The question is whether we will 
have the ability to support the troops with the necessary 
equipment, winter clothing and boots, medicine, engineering 
supplies, and other vital logistics to sustain operations in 
such a harsh environment there," said a source. 
  Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, meanwhile, 
said 
Malaysia wants the UN Security Council to allow member countries 
to openly debate the atrocities and ethnic cleansing by the 
Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Such a move would be against the 
norm of closed-door sessions held by the council. 
  Abdullah said that Malaysia's permanent representative to 
the 
UN, Tan Sri Razali Ismail, would liaise with the NAM 
Coordinating Group Committee and the OIC Contact Group to 
pressure the council for the open debate. He said the council 
was expected to hold its meeting on the Bosnian issue in a 
couple of days. The chances of the meeting being convened were 
good as he understood that Russia, a member of the council with 
veto powers, had shown interest in having such a discussion, he 
added. 
  Abdullah was certain the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
(NATO) would not launch an air strike against Serb artillery 
positions besieging Sarajevo. 
  Meanwhile, [Pakistani Foreign Minister] Asif said moves by 
NATO to lift the siege of Sarajevo fell short of expectations. 
  "In expressing their (the OIC Contact Group's) 
disappointment 
at the lack of resolute action in the past, they underlined the 
imperative of the immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo and 
carrying through the necessary actions foreseen in the latest 
NATO decision," he said. 
  He also said the contact group had agreed to support a 
proposal by Indonesia's president, Suharto, the current NAM 
chairman, for an appropriately structured international 
conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "We welcome the NATO chairman's decision to conduct a 
meeting 
through the NAM Coordinating Bureau in New York to demand more 
effective measures be undertaken by the UN," he said. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Thurs. -- Datuk Sri Dr Mahathir 
Mohamed said he did not believe that the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation (NATO) would carry out its threat to launch against 
Serbian forces, adding that the Serbs would continue with their 
ethnic cleansing. [passage omitted] 
  Dr Mahathir said this when asked by reporters to comment on 
the possibility of NATO military intervention in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. "It (NATO) won't attack... I don't believe 
that NATO will launch any strikes... it will wait for the 10-day 
deadline to pass and then come up with an excuse that the Serbs 
regret their action and promise not to do it again. After this, 
the Serbs will continue with their ethnic cleansing," he said at 
the Science, Technology and Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng 
Ding Chinese New Year open house here today [10 February]. 
  Asked about Russia's suggestion that Sarajevo be 
administered 
by the United Nations, Dr Mahathir said Russia should first of 
all tell the Serbs to withdraw. Only after this could there be 
discussions on such a topic, Dr Mahathir said. "What is 
important is for the Serbs to stop the attacks. But I don't 
believe that the Russian or NATO's warning would compel the 
Serbs to stop their policy of ethnic cleansing. "Everyone knows 
-- NATO knows, the Americans know -- that when they issue a 
threat they will not carry it out... and so the Serbs will 
continue with their killing," the prime minister said. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Feb 14 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- 
Arrangements are being made to fly back the first of 10 
British-made Hawk 100 advanced jet trainers purchased by 
Malaysia at the end of the month, Royal Malaysian Air Force 
(RMAF) officials said Monday. RMAF pilots would be flying the 
aircraft from Britain to its new home at the RMAF air base in 
Butterworth, better known as Malaysia's fightertown. The 
officials said the nine other Hawk 100 would be delivered by 
British Aerospace (BAe) in batches until the end of the year. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Hawk 100s were bought under the RM [Ringgit Malaysia] 
2.4 
billion memorandum of understanding [MOU] signed between 
Malaysia and Britain in 1988. The RMAF also ordered 18 hawk 200 
aircraft under the same agreement. The RMAF would be the first 
air force in the region to fly the British-made aircraft. 
Indonesia is reported to be buying the aircraft too. [passage 
omitted] 
  The MOU also provides fog training of RMAF pilots and ground 
crew, including technicians, under an offset programme. A total 
of 69 RMAF technicians would be attending 20 types of courses. 
Four selected RMAF pilots, who completed a three-year training 
programme, would become instructors on the creation of a new 
squadron at the Butterworth air base. [passage omitted] 
  In December 1990, Malaysia reached agreement under the same 
MOU for a rm400 million offset deal involving technology 
transfer to Malaysian defence-related industries such as 
Syarikat Malaysia Explosives, the country's ordnance 
manufacturer and AIROD Sdn. Bhd. [Company Limited], Malaysia's 
privatised aircraft and overhaul facilities. 
  The offset programme, for the local manufacture of air 
delivered ordnance and ammunition (bombs and missiles), ground 
support equipment, aircraft components, repair and overhaul 
services would enable Malaysia to be self-sufficient in the 
support of the fleet of Hawk aircraft.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Feb. 12 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- South 
Africa has opened its embassy in Malaysia following the decision 
by Kuala Lumpur and Pretoria to establish diplomatic and trade 
relations last November. 
  The temporary office of the embassy, which was officially 
established on Dec. 6 last year, is at the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, 
here. It is headed by Charge d'Affaires Henri S. Gaubenheimer. 
  Second Secretary (Administration) Andre Lizamore told 
BERNAMA 
Saturday the embassy was in the process of identifying 
appropriate premises for the chancery and official residence and 
hoped to move into the new buildings in April. 
  Meanwhile, Third Secretary and Deputy Head of the South 
African Mission to Malaysia, Jan Groenewald, said in a statement 
that with the establishment of the embassy here matters 
pertaining to relations between South Africa and Malaysia would 
no longer be dealt with by the South African Embassy in 
Singapore. Groenewald was the officer at the embassy in 
Singapore dealing with Malaysia. He will move to Kuala Lumpur 
on March 1.

  [Text] Ukraine was once known as having an active (?share) 
among the former Soviet states and becoming a prosperous 
economy. Two years after gaining independence, this assessment 
has yet to bear fruit. It is still wrestling with what is a 
difficult process: to become a market economy. Nevertheless, 
its government is committed to bring economic development to the 
country as quickly as possible. As such, the recent visit of 
Ukraine's deputy foreign minister of external economic relations 
to Malaysia is a step in the right direction. 
  The move would help initiate cooperation between the two 
countries as well as enhance mutually beneficial economic 
activities. The minister, A.D. Makarenko, said that his country 
was offering attractive investment incentives to foreign 
investors. Expanding its foreign trade and deepening the 
industrial base could perhaps be the right target in providing a 
boost to the country's economy. 
  Malaysian companies, having the expertise in certain 
manufacturing operations should take advantage of these 
incentives through [word indistinct]. This is because, through 
Ukraine, they could make inroads into the vast export markets of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  Ukraine also has a well educated labor force, abundant 
natural resources, and market accessibility into neighboring 
countries. Areas of cooperation Ukraine is looking for is in 
skilled production and electrical-related equipment, or the 
areas of hotel construction as well as hotel management. 
  Joint ventures could facilitate the transfer of technology. 
However, whatever cooperation is finalized, should be mutually 
beneficial. There is a lot the former Soviet state could also 
offer to Malaysia, including defense technology capability and 
aircraft manufacture. For example, the world's largest 
aircraft, the An-225 [word indistinct], space shuttle carrier, 
and the world's second largest aircraft, the An-124 (Ruslan) are 
made in Ukraine. 
  Given such credentials, the technology could be used to set 
up joint ventures in Malaysia to manufacture aircraft parts. At 
the same time, perhaps it could play a role in lending expertise 
in Malaysia's development of the space industry. 
  Makarenko has indicated his country is keen to share its 
expertise in space program and aircraft manufacturing especially 
in the area of large cargo planes. This being the case, there 
is definitely room for two-way investments. Malaysia too could 
offer its expertise in the successful privatization of 
government agencies. This is timely as Ukraine is in the 
process of privatizing about 40,000 projects this year. 
  It is hoped that a trade agreement is formalized between the 
two countries soon. This would pave the way for increased 
commercial linkages and the setting up of joint ventures. The 
move would go toward giving the Ukrainian economy a badly needed 
boost. More than anything else, Ukraine needs a great infusion 
of economic assistance. Malaysia could very well provide that 
economic assistance.

  [Text] As the Sabah polls are drawing nearer for this 
Friday and Saturday, both Malaysia's National Front party, BN, 
and the Sabah United Party, PBS, not to mention the 
independents, are intensifying their campaigns, each confident 
of victory. The BN is set to topple the PBS ruling party 
through a master plan for development and the creation of a new 
Sabah, transforming the state on par with other states in 
peninsular Malaysia. Through BN manifesto and the new Sabah 
slogan, the BN has pledged, among other things, peace; 
stability; prosperity; high economic growth; and by the turn of 
the century, a per capita income of 10,000 [Malaysian ringgit] a 
year; eradication of poverty, which is now 23 percent of the 
population; and the setting up of a university. 
  The PBS has expressed confidence through its manifesto that 
Sabah is for the strong-willed people of Sabah and continuity in 
the voters would return it to power for a fourth consecutive 
term. 
  Political observers and journalists following the BN and PBS 
campaigns said that both -- the BN and PBS -- have a 50-50 
chance of winning the election. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, who is 
campaigning in Sabah for the second time since nomination day on 
7 February, is confident that the BN would wrest power from the 
PBS. He has said that feedbacks received from all the 48 
constituencies showed that the BN election machinery had been 
able to counter the opposition claim and its own message had 
been accepted by the voters.

  [Text] Since the time the PBS [Sabah United Party] began 
to rule the state, it has not only stalled development programs, 
but has also adopted an anti-Islamic stand. In contrast, if 
the National Front rules Sabah after the 18-19 February 
elections, it will respect and provide equal treatment to all 
religions. Speaking at a public gathering at the (Kinaru Papar) 
junior high school, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the 
National Front does not give priority to a single ethnic group, 
but attaches great importance to all ethnic groups. 
  The deputy prime minister also criticized PBS leader Datuk 
Pairin, who was found guilty of corruption and is interested 
only in his own interests and those of his family and immediate 
circle of friends, without paying attention to the plight of the 
people. Datuk Anwar said the upcoming elections will be a golden 
opportunity for the Sabah people to get rid of Datuk Pairin and 
the PBS if they want a change in Sabah political leadership. He 
said he is satisfied with the support given by local voters and 
believes that Sabah will get a new government after the 
elections if all voters give their support to the National Front.

  [Excerpts] Kota Kinabalu, Tues [8 February] -- A minimum 
RM700 [Malaysian ringgits] million allocation for low-cost 
housing, 123 schools, a university and massive development 
programmes to increase the per capita income of the people in 
Sabah to RM10,000 by the year 2000 are the emphasis of the 
Barisan Nasional manifesto unveiled today. [Passage omitted 
covered by referent item] 
  The main theme of the Parti Bersatu Sabah [PBS] [United 
Sabah 
Party] manifesto, unveiled by party president and Chief 
Minister Datuk Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan this morning, is the 
recurring thorny issues in State-Federal ties since PBS came 
into power in 1985. 
  The key points in the PBS manifesto are similar to those 
used 
in the last three elections. They include a more equitable 
sharing of petroleum revenue, and safeguarding Sabah's 
constitutional rights. 
  The PBS says it will pursue the proposal to set up a 
university and a separate TV station. It also emphasises that 
the party will continue to seek from the Federal Government a 
long-term solution to the Philippines' claim on Sabah, more 
effective ways to prevent the inflow of illegal immigrants and 
manage those in the State. [passage omitted] 
  This time the 13-page manifesto also makes subtle references 
to Umno's [United Malays National Organization] presence in 
Sabah. In an apparent reference to Umno and Federal leaders, it 
says the party will seek to free Sabahans from fear of political 
domination and eliminate any tendency from any quarter to exert 
their "tyranny over the minds of man by one person or group from 
within or out side Sabah". [passage omitted] 
  The 14-point economic programme outlined aims at further 
diversifying, adding value and restructuring Sabah's economic 
base and enhancing its competitiveness in the international 
market. It will continue to create a conducive environment for 
private sector growth, intensify training and development of 
entrepreneurship and technical skills. 
  When pointed out that the PBS development agenda paled in 
comparison with the BN's plans, Pairin said the promise was not 
new. 
  "If we were in the Federal Government, we would do more than 
that. All these promises should have been done from 1963 (the 
year Sabah joined Malaysia). [passage omitted] 
  He claimed that the BN manifesto was an election ploy and 
that the only thing new was to "put in writing all these 
promises" 
  He blamed the BN for the inferior infrastructure in Sabah 
and 
the shortage of personnel such as doctors saying that the BN's 
record in Sabah was poor. 
  On the State-Federal relations, he said the PBS would seek 
sincere and mutual understanding towards better a political 
relationship with the Federal Government and enhance national 
integration and unity. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Singapore has welcomed the ultimatum issued by NATO 
to the Bosnian Serbs. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said 
the stakes in Bosnia are high for the international community 
and failure to effectively implement the latest ultimatum would 
lead not only to more innocent lives lost in Bosnia, it could 
also send a wrong signal that the international community is now 
prepared to tolerate and accept aggression. 
  The Foreign Ministry notes that the immediate response of 
the 
Bosnian Serbs has been to call for a cease-fire around Sarajevo. 
However, the ministry adds that the Bosnian Serbs have 
established a cynical pattern of bending to international 
pressures but immediately reverting to their indiscriminate 
attacks when the threat of military action is lifted.

<F P=106> [By Douglas Wong] </F>
  [Text] Singapore companies believe the lifting of the U.S. 
trade embargo on Vietnam will bring increased opportunities, 
more than increased competition. 
  With their headstart and good relationship with the 
Vietnamese, the companies here believe they can only benefit 
from the greater influx of U.S. technology, funds, and resulting 
business activities. 
  One such company is Asia Pacific Breweries [APB], which has 
a 
U.S.$22-million (Singapore $34.76-million) brewery investment in 
the country. Said its spokesman: "We welcome the competition 
as this will encourage the beer market to grow even faster. We 
will certainly be working harder, but at the end of the day, APB 
can only benefit from such accelerated growth". 
  Sembawang Engineering's executive chairman, Mr. Cheong Quee 
Wah, said that there will now be additional sources of 
technology and funds for infrastructure projects in Vietnam. He 
added that there is enough business for everyone there. He said 
that Sembawang Engineering, which is developing an $80 million 
[Singapore dollars] power plant there, has established close 
relationships with the Vietnamese, and could even co-operate 
with American companies in infrastructure projects in the future. 
  The Koh Brothers Group, which has just completed a hotel 
project in Ho Chi Minh City and is planning to work on road and 
canal projects there, also sees only greater opportunities. Its 
business manager, Mr. Joseph Koh, said: "The lifting of the 
U.S. embargo will help to increase all business activities in 
Vietnam, and we believe that as one of the early birds, we have 
developed a knowledge of business practises there." 
  Mr. Jen Shek Voon, a director of Ernst &amp; Young 
Consultants, 
believes that Singapore can now capitalise on its reputation as 
an honest broker and effective deal maker in Vietnam better than 
anyone else. "Finally, all Singapore-based companies will be 
able to utilise the excellent government-to-government 
relationship that we have with Vietnam," he said. Agreeing, Mr. 
David Howell of international law firm Baker Mckenzie said: 
"Singapore is well placed to take advantage of its partnering 
strategy with multinationals to penetrate Vietnam". 
  And Ms. Cheah Swee Gim, a partner with local law firm Chor 
Pee &amp; Co. said her firm was confident that it would hold its 
own 
against U.S. law firms going into Vietnam. "Some potential 
foreign clients have told us that they think a Singapore law 
firm understands the social and bureaucratic culture of Vietnam 
better than others," she noted. Chor Pee opened licensed 
representative offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City last May, 
and is looking to employ more lawyers to work there, she said. 
  But of course the outlook for Singapore companies in Vietnam 
is not all rosy. Cycle &amp; Carriage Ltd [CCL], while bullish on 
its 50-percent stake in a joint venture to operate a car rental 
fleet and build a modern vehicle workshop in Ho Chi Minh City, 
sounded a cautionary note on broader business prospects there. 
CCL director Philip Eng cautioned that "progress in a socialist 
environment will be slow and real progress will only be seen at 
the turn of the century".

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Better and Better in ASEAN"] </F>
  [Excerpts] When President Fidel Ramos visited Malaysia last 
year, he was the first Philippine leader to do so after 25 
years. Last week, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed returned the 
courtesy. Not since Tunku Abdul Rahman had a Malaysian prime 
minister been there on an official visit in 30 years. Such 
reserve showed in the modest trade links: the two countries did 
no more than [Singapore dollar] $555 million worth of business 
in the first nine months of last year. [passage omitted] Talking 
to Filipinos in Manila, one gets the feeling that more than a 
few do not share an ASEAN destiny. It is not insularity, but an 
apartness built on the country's Spanish-American past and 
Christian outlook. That is changing, however. 
  Improved relations with Malaysia are a key element of that 
process. This impinges on ASEAN cohesion, as the number of 
territorial disputes, apart from the one on Sabah, are a 
constant reminder that good neighbourliness cannot be taken for 
granted. The Spratlys dispute concerns three ASEAN nations; 
Malaysia and Indonesia have not settled the issue of Sipadan and 
Ligitan; while Malaysia has not given up its claim on Pedra 
Branca. Sabah, lest it be forgotten, is not a closed file. 
There are complexities which will take much negotiation and 
goodwill to disentangle. Neither Dr. Mahathir nor Mr. Ramos 
pretend that a settlement can be had in their lifetime. [passage 
omitted] What bodes will for ASEAN is that after three decades, 
Malaysia and the Philippines accept that, one, the Sabah 
resolution need not be tied to a time-frame, and two, that 
economic co-operation should not be held hostage to it. The 
Sabah question, as agreed upon before Dr. Mahathir went to 
Manila, is now held in suspended animation. [passage omitted] 
  What is "positive" was what the Mahathir visit was about: 
trade and investment links. If there is sustained economic 
expansion, no political problem can remain intractable for long. 
It was significant that on the Malaysian side, the initiative 
came from the private sector which was a big part of the 
Mahathir party. The nine memoranda of understanding signed with 
Philippine interests cover infrastructure work that the 
Filipinos need badly to ignite growth: highways, hotels, power 
and water plants, rail systems. Intriguing was the Malaysian 
offer of a financing instrument called the Bilateral Payments 
Arrangement (BPA) to boost trade. Under this system originally 
meant for the Group of 15 developing countries, importers and 
exporters are guaranteed payment through the central banks of 
trading partners. Malaysia has BPA links with 21 countries with 
trade amounting to [Malaysian dollar] $4 billion. It will be a 
help to the Philippines. Less clear is the concept of an East 
Asian growth crescent covering Mindanao, Brunei, the East 
Malaysian states, and eastern Indonesia. If it takes off it 
will energise development on a big scale, on a par with the 
ASEAN free trade area scheme. The framework and growth 
mechanisms will take time to evolve. Conditions are favourable, 
however, such as the greatly reduced threat from the Muslim 
separatists and jungle guerillas in the Philippines. This may 
be Manila's biggest contribution to ASEAN and to itself.

  [Excerpts] According to various diplomatic sources, the 
U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh has been in close contact with the 
two-headed government and the Vietnamese communist puppets' 
General Staff officials, especially Ke Kimyan, Pol Saroeun, and 
Long Sopheap, in order to follow up and set plans for their 
military operations against the people and the national 
resistance forces in various areas, particularly the Route 68 
region from Samraong to Anlung Veng. [passage omitted] 
  The same sources reported further that the Americans know 
perfectly well that there are a large number of Vietnamese 
forces in the puppet army's General Staff, the various military 
regions, the divisions, and the special intervention units. The 
Americans have even known about the Vietnamese communists' 
activities in arranging for the puppet colonels and generals to 
study in Vietnam in January and setting up plans for continuing 
military operations in the current dry season. 
  This proves that the Americans have joined hands with the 
Vietnamese communists; that is, while the Vietnamese communists 
openly stage the play, the Americans act as the paymaster behind 
the scenes. Openly, the Americans have kept claiming that there 
are no Vietnamese in Cambodia. This is a concrete activity in 
line with the U.S.-led Western alliance's policy and strategy to 
smash the Cambodian national resistance forces, especially the 
Democratic Kampuchean forces, so that they can scramble for the 
flesh and blood of the Cambodian nation and people in the 
interests of their economic strategy and other interests. 
  Actively following the aforementioned policy and strategy, 
they have inducted the ANKI forces of the FUNCINPEC [National 
United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and 
Cooperative Cambodia] Party and the troops of the other Paras 
[former non-communist resistance groups] into the Vietnamese 
communist puppet forces and sent them to launch operations 
against the Cambodian people and national resistance forces 
since August 1993. Since then, they have launched operations at 
Phnum Chhat, Stoung, Kompong Thom, Preah Vihear, Siem Reap, 
Samraong, Oddar Meanchey, Anlung Veng, and various other areas. 
This is why the flames of war continue to blaze in Cambodia. 
This is why the Vietnamese communists have been so bold and 
kept flowing into Cambodia without any fear. 
  However, the history of previous centuries and the current 
new developments clearly attest to the truth that the aggressors 
will certainly face shameful defeat vis-a-vis a nation and 
people who dare to fight for the survival of their country and 
race.

  [Text] An official from the Kingdom of Cambodia's Foreign 
Affairs and International Cooperation Ministry has said that SRV 
Foreign Minister Mr. Nguyen Manh Cam will pay a three-day 
official visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia -- from 16 to 18 
February -- accompanied by senior Vietnamese officials. The 
official said that the official visit is being made at the 
invitation of Prince Kromluong Norodom Sirivut, minister of 
foreign affairs and international cooperation, and will pave the 
way for the Vietnamese prime minister to visit Cambodia in March. 
  Analysts say the exchange of visits is necessary for the 
sake 
of relations between the two countries following the Thai prime 
minister's visit to Cambodia. Vietnam and Cambodia are 
entangled in a great many problems, such as the problem of 
Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia and the border problem, not to 
mention past racial problems. It is expected that the two 
countries will be able to maintain good relations for the sake 
of their own development.

<F P=106> ["Appeal by Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime </F>
minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, to officers and soldiers of 
the Democratic Kampuchea faction -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] (?Last week), after the Khmer Royal Armed 
Forces [KRAF] seized full control of important positions of the 
Khmer Rouge [KR] faction in Siem Reap, Oddar Meanchey, Preah 
Vihear, Kompong Thom, Banteay Meanchey, and especially at Anlung 
Veng, I, Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime 
minister, and Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister of the 
Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia and co-commanders in 
chief of the KRAF, made an appeal to the fraternal officers and 
soldiers of the KR faction to quickly return to the national 
community to end the misery of the Cambodian people and your 
families. [passage omitted] 
  Time and again, the RGC represented by myself personally met 
and sent successive letters to KR leaders to discuss and jointly 
settle problems through a peaceful means. The RGC's activities 
carried out on the basis of national reconciliation, in 
political and legal terms, show that it has placed itself very 
lowly. The only thing the RGC wants in lowering itself this 
much is to end the conflict through peaceful means to bring our 
country toward full peace and national reconciliation. 
  These activities attest more clearly that the RGC is not a 
war- advocate and definitely not a warmonger. On the contrary, 
the RGC is a pacifist. But the KR ringleaders [words 
indistinct]. They have used the negotiation label to destroy 
negotiations and hinder the peace process. They have used 
negotiations to prolong the war and maintain their forces in 
fighting form while negotiating. They have demanded becoming 
advisers and members of the RGC but refused to recognize the RGC 
that they want to join. [passage omitted] 
  With repeated appeals to the brothers who are holding arms 
or 
[words indistinct] from the KR ringleaders, we would like to 
call on all of you to hurry back to your motherland, homeland, 
and families to be in time for our nation's traditional new 
year. Do not hesitate any longer. Whether you were routed from 
Anlung Veng and various other battlefields or are staying at any 
other bases [words indistinct] which will also face the same 
fate as Anlung Veng, there is no better way for you than to 
return to your families who are looking forward to seeing you 
and to the national community which has always been ready to 
pardon you. 
  The desire of our people as well as of our RGC -- the sole 
legitimate representative of our Cambodian land which is 
indivisible -- is nothing but unity, happiness, peace, and 
family reunion and to build a livelihood and national economy 
and to jointly defend the country under the very cool shade of 
the king who is most respected and loved by all of us. We do 
not, in the least, want our fellow Cambodians to continue 
shedding blood and the Cambodian families to further break up 
and suffer. [passage omitted] 
  You must be aware also that lawfulness [word indistinct] and 
peaceful life can exist only inside the Kingdom of Cambodia 
under the august king, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, 
reigning the (?people) and national reconciliation and the RGC 
which is recognized as the sole royal government of our beloved 
Cambodian motherland. For this reason, the KR ringleaders have 
carried on the war and sought every means to make you live as 
outlaws with them. In your mind, you may have already realized 
that many of you have always thought and wished for the KRAF to 
quickly launch activities near your areas in order to liberate 
you from [word indistinct] of the KR ringleaders. [passage 
omitted] 
  During the past few days, over 3,000 brothers have returned. 
Some of them have asked for permission to return to their native 
villages [words indistinct]. Others have volunteered to serve 
the KRAF. Those who used to have ranks have been honorably 
given ranks by the RGC. [passage omitted] The RGC has set up a 
royal government delegation led by Samdech Hun Sen and myself to 
make arrangements to welcome you and provide facilities for all 
brothers to return in time for the traditional new year so that 
you can live happily in your hometowns with your families. 
[passage omitted] 
  I can assure you that you will [words indistinct] as 
citizens 
in general if you want to return to your hometowns and will be 
inducted into the the KRAF if you want to maintain [words 
indistinct]. All money and belongings that you bring along will 
be kept for you. If you bring along arms and ammunition or 
point out arms caches of the KR faction, you will be rewarded 
satisfactorily. 
  Brothers, please consider what to do. Should you [words 
indistinct] in isolation from (?country), national community, 
families, and hometown as the KR ringleaders have imposed and 
are imposing on you. You should choose -- to live lawfully in 
your hometown with your families or to live outside the law; 
peace or waiting for the same fate as Anlung Veng and other 
territories where the RGC could not pardon illegal control over 
them by the KR ringleaders. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On the morning of 10 February, a plenary session of 
the Council of Ministers was held under the chairmanship of 
Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, and 
Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, of the Royal Government 
of Cambodia to examine a number of bills and major issues. 
  1. The meeting discussed and adopted the bill on the 
establishment and the functioning of the Supreme Council of 
Judges. This bill, consisting of 22 articles, is very important. 
It not only ensures the independence of the judiciary but is 
also the basis of a law to move toward the establishment and the 
functioning of the Constitutional Council of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia [KOC]. The state secretariat for relations with 
Parliament will submit this bill to the National Assembly for 
examination and decision. 
  2. In accordance with Article 41 of the KOC Constitution, 
the cabinet decided to examine the press law at its next meeting 
to determine the freedom of the press, freedom of publication, 
and the responsibility of organizations or networks 
disseminating information to Cambodian listeners. This is to 
conform with the country's political situation. 
  3. The cabinet also discussed the legal procedures relating 
to the cabinet and assigned the cabinet office to supervise and 
implement this task. 
  4. The meeting also listened to the report by the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on goals 
relating to the consolidation and expansion of international 
relations, particularly bilateral relations with countries that 
have diplomatic relations with the KOC. 
  5. The plenary session also listened to the report by the 
Ministry of Industry, Energy, and Mines on the progress of oil 
exploration and on the restoration and repair of hydropower. 
The cabinet examined a number of concrete measures to ensure 
proper and firm implementation of the decisions of the cabinet 
at its plenary session on 26 January, which set the electricity 
rate at 350 riel per kilowatt/hour for general users. Relevant 
ministries were requested to consider reducing the rate for 
light industry. 
  6. The cabinet also listened to the report by the Tourism 
Ministry relating to a number of principles for developing 
tourism. 
  The cabinet closed its plenary session at 1145 with a lofty 
spirit of unanimity and responsibility.

Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, respectively first and second 
prime ministers of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC], have 
just appointed General Chhim Chhorn as commander of the former 
Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] soldiers who have rallied to 
the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF]. Gen. Chhim Chhorn, with 
his new role, will receive orders directly from the first and 
second prime ministers. 
  Thousands of soldiers from the PDK, the only faction that 
boycotted last year's UN-supervised general polls, have defected 
and rejoined national community following the implementation of 
national reconciliation policy under the august directive of His 
Majesty Norodom Sihanouk. 
  In northwestern Battambang Province alone, the number of the 
Khmer Rouge returnees had reached 3,364 by the end of December 
last year. Among the 235 Khmer Rouge troops incorporated in the 
KRAF, 58 former officers and noncommissioned officers have been 
promoted as senior and junior officers.

  [Text] The two-headed government on 8 February mustered 
over 200 puppet and Paras [former Khmer People's National 
Liberation Front] troops at the 12th Division's base of (Vieng 
Khaidan) in preparation to attack the people and Democratic 
Kampuchea [DK] in an area south of Route 5. The people, 
however, in cooperation with the National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea [NADK], attacked and dispersed the invading troops to 
protect their lives and property. We killed eight enemy 
soldiers, wounded more than 10, and captured 16 others, 
including a colonel and a Vietnamese soldier. We seized 25 
assorted firearms, five sets of field radios, and some war 
materiel. 
  Between 6 and 8 February, the two-headed government attacked 
the people and DK with over 300 troops in an area west of Route 
56. After three days of fighting, we completely dispersed them. 
We killed five invading soldiers, wounded 12 others, and seized 
11 assorted firearms and some war materiel. 
  Leaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed 
government on 29 January forced their soldiers to attack the 
people and NADK in the Srah Kev area, Baribo District, Kompong 
Chhnang Province. We attacked and completely dispersed them as 
they were approaching the area. We killed or wounded 13 enemy 
soldiers, destroyed a vehicle loaded with ammunition, and seized 
nine AK rifles and some war materiel. We completely control the 
area. 
  Leaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed 
government on 1 February forced their soldiers to attack the 
people and NADK at O Krabau and Pel villages in Moung District 
of Battambang Province. They were, however, ambushed and 
completely routed by the people and NADK. We killed six enemy 
soldiers, wounded nine others, and seized two firearms and some 
war materiel. 
  The people and NADK on 2 February ambushed soldiers of the 
Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government in 
Kralaom Phluk area, Tuol Thnung village, Prey Svay commune, 
Moung District, Battambang Province. We killed or wounded seven 
enemy soldiers and seized three AK rifles and some war materiel. 
We also cut off their supply line between Kralaom Phluk and 
Tuol Thnung. 
  On 8 February, the people, who were furious at the repeated 
persecution and assaults by the troops of the two-headed 
government, cooperated with the NADK in attacking, sweeping, and 
dispersing the invading troops gathering at Aranh, (Tuol Spean 
Chruoh), and (Kum Noch) villages. The people alo destroyed two 
ammunition depots belonging to the Siem Reap provincial army 
that contained rice crops and husked rice plundered from the 
people for feeding its troops.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 12 February commentary: "The United States </F>
Must Act With Discretion"] 
  [Text] The United States, which has built a grave obstacle 
to peacefully resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula even after overturning its agreement with us, is now 
behaving more recklessly. Completely contrary to the agreement, 
U.S. hard-line conservatives urge us to accept a full-scope 
inspection [chonmyon sachal] and are openly maneuvering to bring 
our nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. They are also 
urging France, Britain, Russia, and other countries to join in 
sanctions [chejae] on us. This is a maneuver to bring the 
situation to a catastrophe [paguk] to the end. 
  As clearly manifested in the agreement reached at the 
DPRK-U.S. contact held toward the end of last year, the 
inspection which we agreed to receive is an inspection for 
purely ensuring the continuity of safeguards [sunsu tamboui 
yonsoksong pojangul wihan sacharida]. This inspection is 
starkly different [omyonhui kubyoltoenda] from regular and 
irregular inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi sachal] legally 
required by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. 
  Inspection for ensuring the continuity of safeguards has 
stemmed from our special position [tuksuhan chiwi] that we 
temporarily suspended the effectuation of our withdrawal from 
the NPT. 
  The United States must not have forgotten the agreement 
reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact which was held toward the end 
of last year, not several years ago, or failed to differentiate 
an inspection for purely ensuring the continuity of safeguards 
from a full-scope inspection [chonmyon sachal], which is 
tantamount to a return to the treaty. 
  In view of our special position and the promise between us 
and the United States, demanding a full-scope inspection can in 
no way be justifiable. Nevertheless, U.S. hardline 
conservatives ask us to accept a full-scope inspection and are 
openly maneuvering to have sanctions [chejae chochi] imposed on 
us in case we do not accept this request. This cannot be 
construed otherwise than an act for blocking the peaceful 
resolution of the nuclear issue and deliberately bringing the 
situation to a catastrophe. 
  This kind of act by the United States in fact shows that it 
has from the beginning no will to resolve the issue peacefully 
through talks, but that it is only pursuing the goal of trying 
to provide a moral obligation to crush [apsal] us in whatever 
way. 
  Viewing from its cause and characteristics, the nuclear 
issue 
on the Korean peninsula is an issue which must be resolved 
between us and the United States. It is very clear that the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is not an issue to be 
discussed at the UN Security Council. The hardline 
conservatives of the United States are trying to drag our 
nuclear issue to the United Nations. This is because it is a 
reemergence of its habitual maneuver to use the United Nations 
as its tool of tyranny. 
  France is actively following such maneuvers of the United 
States. France is a nuclear power and has committed innumerable 
nuclear tests, thus seriously polluting man's ecological 
environment. Therefore, it is a country that is receiving 
resolute protest and denunciation from the broad peace-loving 
people of the world. France's act of scheming with the United 
States by shamelessly interfering in the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula, is indeed inviting the people's hatred. 
  As the whole world knows, we have already clearly announced 
that any kind of sanctions will be regarded as a proclamation of 
war against us. It is a well known fact that we by no means 
make empty talk. The hard-line conservatives of the United 
States and their followers who are scheming to unreasonably drag 
our nuclear issue to the UN Security Council to take sanctions, 
must contemplate on what dangerous consequences their moves can 
bring about. 
  Pressure and threat do not by any means work for us. The 
United States must correctly know who it is dealing with and act 
with discretion.

<F P=106> ["Demand of Seditious Quarters of IAEA Is </F>
Unacceptable"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- The seditious 
quarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency instigated by 
the United States, are demanding a comprehensive inspection of 
the DPRK and threatening that it would take a new "step," if we 
refused it. Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says: 
  This is a sinister act trampling upon the sovereignty and 
dignity of our Republic and a crude interference in our internal 
affairs. And it is a deliberate act to block a peaceful solution 
of the nuclear issue by complicating the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The author of the commentary further says: 
  The DPRK is a special position today after temporarily 
stopping the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  At the DPRK-U.S. contacts last year it had agreed to receive 
inspection necessary for the continuity of the safeguards of the 
IAEA on its nuclear sites and discussed this matter with the 
secretariat of the agency. 
  If the secretariat truly has the intention to peacefully 
solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it must 
renounce its unreasonable demand going beyond the scope of 
inspection necessary for the continuity of safeguards. 
  No threat and blackmail can work on the Korean people. 
  The seditious quarters of the IAEA should look squarely at 
the reality and behave themselves properly.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S. hardline 
conservatives are urging the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea to accept a comprehensive inspection and trying to bring 
its "nuclear problem" to the United Nations Security Council, 
while egging some countries on to join in "sanctions" against 
the DPRK. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN and MINJU CHOSON today say 
this is a scheme to bring the situation to a hopeless phase. 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst says: 
  Their call for a comprehensive inspection can never be 
justified both in view of the special position of the DPRK, 
which has temporarily suspended the effectuation of the 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the 
agreement reached between the DPRK and the United States. 
Nevertheless, the U.S. hardline conservatives are urging the 
DPRK to accept a comprehensive inspection and openly scheming to 
take "sanctions" against the DPRK unless their demand was met. 
This cannot be construed otherwise than an act to obstruct a 
peaceful solution to the nuclear issue and intentionally bring 
the situation to a hopeless phase. 
  France, which possesses nuclear weapons and has been 
bitterly 
denounced by the world peaceloving people for its many nuclear 
tests, has the hardihood to join the United States in its 
nuclear clamor. This invites hatred from the people. 
  We have already declared in an explicit term that we would 
consider any kind of "sanctions" to be something like a 
declaration of war against us. It is well known a fact that we 
never utter empty words. 
  The U.S. hardline conservatives and their lackeys must 
ponder over what dangerous consequences their moves may entail. 
  The United States must know well whom it is dealing with and 
act with discretion. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst says that if the United States try to 
overpower the DPRK with "strength," it would be a big mistake 
and it would meet defeat more serious than that it suffered in 
the Korean war in the '50s.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
answered a question put by KCNA today as regards the recent call 
of the French Foreign Ministry for "sanctions" against the DPRK 
over its "nuclear problem." He said: 
  A deputy spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of France 
released a provocative "statement" on February 3, claiming that 
there had been no success in the DPRK-U.S. talks and it was time 
to bring up the issue of taking "sanctions" against the DPRK at 
the United Nations Security Council. 
  At a time when a serious crisis has been created in the 
situation of the Korean peninsula by a perfidious act of the 
United States, France freely cried for "sanctions" against the 
DPRK, though she must know well what such "sanctions" would 
mean. This was not aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation 
but at finding a pretext for resuming its nuclear tests by 
taking issue with the DPRK's "nuclear problem." 
  Lurking behind this impudent act of France is also her 
sinister intention to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks, egg the United 
States on to a showdown with the DPRK and cause a military 
conflict in the Northeast Asian region including the Korean 
peninsula so that it may fish in troubled waters through the 
massive sale of weapons of destruction. This is clearly proven 
by the fact that France has sold large quantities of weapons to 
this region including South Korea in recent years. 
  It is until some time ago that France sold a big amount of 
plutonium to Japan, not joining the nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty [NPT] on the pretext of "modernization of nuclear 
deterrent." It is unbecoming to her to express "concern" over 
the fate of the NPT now. 
  It is really the height of sarcasm for France, which 
possesses many nuclear weapons and now feels an urge to continue 
nuclear tests, to cry for "sanctions" against the DPRK, charging 
it with the "nuclear problem". 
  We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the 
France 
authorities, ignoring our sincere efforts for a fundamental 
solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, are 
resorting to bellicose acts against us. 
  If France persist in such insidious acts without discretion, 
we will take necessary measures against them. 
  France must look squarely at the situation and ponder on the 
matter.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Unchanged Ambition for </F>
Aggression"] 
  [Text] It was revealed in a report that the United States 
officially appropriated a budget for the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise in its defense budget bill for next year's 
fiscal year. This was revealed when U.S. Defense Secretary Perry 
answered a question raised by a senator at the budget 
deliberation of the Senate Military Committee on 9 February. 
Also, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff explained 
that the budget for the Team Spirit joint military exercise is 
included in next year's budget bill. 
  For the United States to appropriate a budget for the Team 
Spirit joint military exercise in the budget bill of next year's 
fiscal year is a planned and intentional maneuver to aggravate 
tension on the Korean peninsula and to further drive the 
situation toward a catastrophic war. This is an open challenge 
against us who hope to achieve peace and reunification. 
  As everyone knows, the Team Spirit joint military exercise 
is 
a large scale war exercise to invade the North, which is being 
committed by mobilizing hundreds of thousands of enormous forces 
including up-to-date war equipment such as nuclear weapons and 
U.S. imperialist aggression forces brought in from the U.S. 
continent and U.S. bases in the Pacific, the U.S. troops 
occupying South Korea, and the South Korean puppet army. 
  In its character, content, and scope, this war exercise is a 
very provocative and reckless preliminary war and a test nuclear 
war aimed at a nuclear preemptive strike toward the northern 
half of our republic. Whenever this war exercise is committed, 
tension is aggravated on the Korean peninsula and a strained 
situation is created in which a war may break out at any moment. 
  That is why the world has been strongly demanding the 
permanent suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise. 
Also, the issue of suspending the Team Spirit war exercise was 
brought up as one of the important agendas in the North-South 
dialogues and DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  In fact, under the conditions in which more than 1,000 
nuclear weapons are deployed in South Korea, if a war breaks out 
on the Korean peninsula, its flame will be easily spread outside 
the territory of Korea, then a grave consequence will arise. 
  The United States has promised in the DPRK-U.S. talks and 
contacts that it would suspend the Team Spirit exercise. This 
is because the United States itself has admitted the danger of 
the Team Spirit exercise. In the DPRK-U.S. talks and contacts, 
the United States has promised that it will not use any arms, 
including nuclear weapons, nor pose a threat to us by them. 
However, the United States has abandoned its promise and put 
pressure on us, while talking about sanctions against us. Also, 
it has officially included the budget for the Team Spirit war 
exercise into the defense budget for the next fiscal year. This 
is another mean betrayal, as well as a challenge to the party to 
dialogue. 
  While smiling at us at the negotiating table, the United 
States has said that it will not conduct the Team Spirit war 
exercise. On the other hand, behind us, it has included the 
budget for the Team Spirit exercise into the defense budget for 
the next fiscal year. This fact clearly shows that although the 
United States babbles about the relaxation of tensions or 
dialogue or peace on words, it does not indeed want them, and 
that it pursues only the reckless policy of power to crush 
[apsal] us with military might in cooperation with the South 
Korean puppets. 
  Also, this has proven that there are no changes in the 
United 
States' policy toward Korea. As a coyote's instinct is not 
changed, the United States' aggressive instinct and ambition 
will not change. In fact, under these circumstances in which the 
Cold War ended on the earth and in which our nation wishes 
peace, not war, there is no reason at all for the United States 
to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise next year. 
  It will not be even beneficial to the United States itself 
to 
squander a great amount of expenditures by introducing a great 
number of troops and war equipment into South Korea and by 
conducting the Team Spirit joint military exercise for several 
months. 
  Nevertheless, the United States wants to conduct the Team 
Spirit war exercise again next year against us. This shows that 
it wants, without fail, to set a fire of war on the Korean 
peninsula. However, the United States will not frighten our 
people -- who rise up for the just cause -- nor bring them into 
submission by any military threat or blackmail. 
  Our people and the People's Army, who are ready for either 
dialogue or war, will return a war for a war if the United 
States dares to wage a war against us. They retaliate 
thousand-fold against aggressors. 
  The United States must not commit a rash and thoughtless 
act, 
being clearly aware that we do not make empty talks. The U.S. 
plot to resume the dangerous Team Spirit joint military exercise 
will be strongly denounced by the broad peace-loving people 
throughout the world.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Ominous Military Movements"] </F>
  [Text] According to foreign news reports, at a time when 
the focus of attention is whether the Team Spirit-94 joint 
military exercise will be conducted or not, the U.S. forces in 
Okinawa have started making movements. They appear to be making 
those movements on the assumption that this exercise will be 
conducted. The Belleau Wood attack landing ship, the (Danedo) 
landing transport ship, and the (Rodney Davis) missile frigate 
ship of the 7th U.S. Fleet reportedly entered or left the 
(Whitebeach) military port in central Okinawa on 8 and 9 
February. They were loaded with the armed troops of the Third 
U.S. Marine Expeditionary Forces and combat vehicles and various 
other military equipment. The 353d special operation unit of 
the U.S. Air Force at the Kadena base left for South Korea 
aboard MC-130, (Convert), and (Halon) special operation 
aircraft. The U.S. military authorities have said that they 
could not comment on these military units movements because they 
were operational actions. 
  U.S. and South Korean media report the United States decided 
to start the Team Spirit joint military exercise on 22 March and 
ordered the reservists to get ready. However, THE STARS AND 
STRIPES, a semiofficial paper of the U.S. Pacific Command, 
reported on 9 February that no decision had been made on whether 
the Team Spirit war exercise would be conducted or not and that 
the reservists and some military units had been on the way to 
South Korea for training purposes. 
  The movements of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces 
based 
in Okinawa are very ominous and make us more vigilant [kaksongul 
nopiji]. As everybody knows, the issue of whether the Team 
Spirit war exercise is conducted or not this year is a very 
serious and it is directly linked to the peaceful resolution of 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, as an 
imminent measure [tangmyonhan chochi] to hold a third stage of 
talks and resolve the nuclear issue in a package deal, the DPRK 
and the United States agreed toward the end of last year that 
the United States would not conduct the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise in 1994 and that we would receive a limited 
scope of inspections [hanjongdoen pomwiui sacharul] necessary to 
ensure the continuity of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency's safeguards. 
  If the United States discards its agreement with us and 
tries 
to conduct the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise, it will 
be an intolerable mockery of us, a denial of dialogue, and a 
criminal act that brings the situation on the Korean peninsula 
to the brink of war. 
  In actuality, U.S. officials are saying that if the Team 
Spirit joint exercise cannot be conducted, the United States 
will plan to conduct other joint military exercise targeted at 
our Republic. They are openly raving that if the joint military 
exercise cannot be held in South Korea, it should be conducted 
even in Hawaii. 
  In this connection, the DPRK Foreign Ministry's spokesman 
issued the statement on 31 January. This nonetheless, the 
Okinawa-based U.S. forces began a military movement since 8 
February, which is regarded as the simulation of the conduction 
of the Team Spirit joint military exercise. This is something 
that cannot be overlooked. 
  Whenever the United States conducted the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise, it, with Japan as a launching base, brought 
mass- destruction weapons, including nuclear weapons and war 
equipment, into South Korea and conducted war exercises against 
the northern half of the Republic. 
  The United States shipped a landing ship, a transport ship, 
frigate ship to (Whitebeach) port and brought combat vehicles 
and troops into South Korea. In view of its timing and 
strategy, we cannot but regard this as the reoccurrence of the 
Team Spirit war exercise. 
  Washington-backed propaganda means reported that the United 
States has decided to conduct the Team Spirit war exercise 
beginning on 22 March and ordered reservists to prepare for the 
Team Spirit. This is never a coincidence. 
  It is a gross miscalculation if the United States is 
thinking 
of deceiving us by employing a double-pronged strategy--paying 
lip service about the peaceful solution of nuclear issue but, in 
fact, running wild for the moves to bring about a new war 
against our Republic. 
  The double-pronged strategy will further consolidate our 
resolution. If the United States is to assume the position to 
resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it should 
show this through an actual activity and should, above all, give 
up the current pressure commotions against the Republic. 
  There is no change in our position to resolve the nuclear 
issue through dialogue. We already expressed our clear position 
toward the United States trying to crush us through strength. 
  We mean what we say, we never say an empty word. If the 
United States constantly tries to crush us through military 
commotions in spite of our warnings, it should be held entirely 
responsible for a grave situation to be entailed therefrom. 
  We will carefully watch U.S. activities henceforth.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The U.S. 
imperialists on February 9 staged a long-distance bombing 
exercise against the northern half of Korea in the skies above 
Yongwol and Pyongchang, South Korean Kangwon Province, with 
pursuit-assault planes and refueling tankers introduced to 
increase the capacities of mobility and surprise strike of the 
overseas-based flying corps, according to military sources. 
  On the same day, a "P-3" anti-submarine patrol plane which 
took off from the Yokosuka base of Japan staged a strike 
exercise above the waters of South Korea, making low- and 
ultra-low altitude flights. 
  On February 8 and 9, large-calibre artillery units and armed 
bandits of the South Korean puppet Army kicked up a row in 
various areas of Paju County, and Chorwon and Yonchon Counties 
of South Korean Kangwon Province adjacent to the Demilitarized 
Zone along the Military Demarcation Line, firing at random 
artillery pieces and large-calibre machine guns and automatic 
rifles. 
  The frenzied play with fire of the U.S. imperialists and the 
South Korean puppets is a grave challenge to the unanimous 
desire of the Korean people and the world peaceloving peoples 
for peace and detente on the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-san: "Nothing Can Be Gained from </F>
Slanderous Smear Propaganda"] 
  [Text] The U.S. ideological and cultural offensive to 
destroy from within the socialist countries and independent 
countries in Asia has reached a more grave stage. According to 
a report, the U.S. Senate on 25 January passed the bill for 
starting the so-called Radio Free Asia broadcast with Asia as 
its target. 
  According to a report by Voice of America, this radio 
station 
will begin broadcast by placing the focus on our country, China, 
Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar [Burma], and Cambodia. 
  The U.S. plan is to instill the sense of value on U.S.-style 
democracy and poisonous bourgeois ideological elements in 
socialist countries and independent nations in Asia in a bid to 
totally crush socialism and to destroy independent governments 
in this area, thus pursuing insidious purpose. 
  Therefore, the U.S. Senate's passage of the bill for 
starting 
the Radio Free Asia is brazen-faced interference in domestic 
affairs of the Asian countries and an intolerable crime. This is 
why many nations in Asia raised voices of protest and 
denunciation against such maneuvers by the United States. 
  In a weekly briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
stressed that the genuine purpose of passing the bill in the 
U.S. Senate for starting Radio Free Asia is to interfere in the 
domestic affairs of Asian countries and to create confusion by 
means of mass media. 
  Besides, the Vietnamese newspaper, THE PEOPLE, denounced and 
rejected the U.S. Senate's resolution as brazen-faced 
interference in the domestic affairs of the Asian countries, and 
a Lao Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the U.S. decision to 
set up a Radio Free Asia broadcasting station goes counter to 
cooperation, peace and development in Asia, and that the Radio 
Free Europe had been used as a tool for opposing the former 
Soviet Union and socialist countries in East Europe. 
  It is quite natural, therefore, that the Asian countries 
show 
strong resistance to the United States' movement to start Radio 
Free Asia. There are plenty reasons that many Asian countries, 
including China, Vietnam, and Laos, expressed their strong 
opposition to the U.S. Senate's step. 
  Radio Free Asia is another version of the former Voice of 
Freedom and Radio Free Europe broadcasts. 
  As has been widely known, the Voice of Freedom and Radio 
Free 
Europe were put into operation when the imperialists, frightened 
by expanded and strengthened socialist forces on a worldwide 
scale, declared the Cold War policy and ran amok with 
antisocialist maneuvers. 
  As for Radio Free Europe, it was inaugurated in the United 
States, and served as a bugler for frustrating the people's 
faith in socialism and for destroying socialist countries from 
within under the financial support of the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency. 
  The Voice of Freedom and Radio Free Europe broadcasts, which 
were operating in Munich, Germany, disseminated various 
slanderous and smear rumors in an attempt to create discord and 
social confusion in the former Soviet Union and socialist 
countries in East Europe, and persistently infiltrated bourgeois 
ideology and culture into these countries. 
  In this way, the United States is also maneuvering to 
destroy 
socialist countries and independent nations in Asia 
ideologically, culturally, and mentally. The United States 
regards our country as its important target. If those who are 
going to begin the broadcast of Radio Free Asia think that they 
can do something against our people with false, deceitful, and 
slanderous propaganda, it is indeed a foolish miscalculation. 
They should precisely realize this. 
  We have the chuche idea--the great guiding ideology--and our 
own-style unique way of life. The broadcast of Radio Free Asia 
may send disorderly electric waves out into space, but it can 
never make our people's spiritual world turbid. This is also 
applied to other countries in Asia. There is an Asian-style 
tradition which has been solidified through a long history and a 
sense of Asian-style culture in Asia. 
  The spirit of independence that the masters of Asia are the 
Asian people has been further enhanced among the people in many 
Asian countries and based on this spirit, the people are dealing 
with the infiltration of reactionary ideas and culture from 
outside with heightened vigilance. 
  The United States is scheming to destroy the Asian-style 
tradition and spoil the sense of culture with yellow propaganda. 
But its attempt will never be successful. Our people and all 
Asians will resolutely smash all maneuvers to block the fierce 
trend of time toward socialism and independence. The United 
States should immediately discard its maneuvers to begin 
broadcasting Radio Free Asia.

<F P=106> [Dialogue between station reporters Kim Myong and Kim </F>
Sang-ul: "The Civilian Warmongers are Dashing Along the Road of 
War" -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Kim Myong] As you know, traitor Kim Yong-sam 
recently revealed his true color as a civilian warmonger more 
clearly than before. I would like to talk about this with you. 
  [Kim Sang-ul] The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique recently raved 
that in the event the adventurous Team Spirit joint military 
exercise is suspended, it will stage large scale exercises of a 
northward nuclear war of aggression, including Ulchi-Focus Lens, 
in August with the United States. 
  THE WASHINGTON TIMES referred to remarks of the South Korean 
hard-liners against the North and of military experts and 
reported that to fill the vacuum caused by suspending the Team 
Spirit joint military exercise, other types of joint military 
exercises may be conducted by South Korea and the United States. 
  This single fact alone shows that traitor Kim Yong-sam is 
going to further intensify North-South confrontation and war 
maneuvers this year. 
  [Kim Myong] Two years ago, the United States and the South 
Korean puppets announced that they would suspend the Team Spirit 
war exercise in a bid to help North-South dialogue. However, 
they conducted exercises of a northward nuclear war of 
aggression under a different name, claiming that they should 
fill up the vacuum. Thus, they led the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war. The people still clearly remember 
this. 
  Even before one year passed since he came to office under 
the 
veil of civilian politics, traitor Kim Yong-sam is going to 
stage, on a larger scale, a northward nuclear aggressive war 
exercise with the United States under a title other than Team 
Spirit. This shows that traitor Kim Yong-sam is a warmonger more 
vicious and vile than previous military dictators. 
  [Kim Sang-ul] Yes. You are right. While staging the 93-Ulchi 
war exercise in July last year, traitor Kim Yong-sam directed 
that this exercise should be conducted in the atmosphere of a 
real war. The puppet prime minister also stressed that the 
exercise should be conducted by stressing the importance of a 
strong sense of national security, thus instigating war 
hysterics. 
  Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of South Korean puppets 
and U.S. Forces in South Korea, and tens of thousands of troops 
from the U.S. mainland participated in the Ulchi-Focus Lens 
joint military exercise, which was staged for as long as 15 days 
last August. In addition, a number of lethal weapons, including 
nuclear weapons, were mobilized in this exercise. 
  At that time, public opinion pointed out that this joint 
military exercise is another version of the Team Spirit war 
exercise -- only in different name. This is not an accident at 
all. 
  If they conduct a large-scale South Korean-U.S. joint 
military exercise this year, and even add the Ulchi war 
exercise, people will doubt the significance of suspending Team 
Spirit. 
  [Kim Myong] You are right. Facts illustrate that the Kim 
Yong- sam puppet clique is a group of warmongers and national 
traitors, who are dashing along the road of war, going against 
the trend of the time, not toward peace. The facts also show 
that the so-called Kim Yong-sam civilian government is deceptive 
and that it is in actuality a more vicious and cunning bellicose 
regime than previous military dictatorial regimes. 
  As this civilian regime emerged from the root of a military 
fascist dictatorial regime, there cannot be any change. 
  [Kim Sang-ul] The whole world, not to mention fellow 
countrymen, unanimously wish that the North and the South on the 
Korean peninsula will advance toward detente and cooperation, 
instead of confrontation and division as seen last year. This 
year we are also making all sincere efforts to improve 
North-South relations and open a new aspect for national 
reunification in conformity with the desire of all fellow 
countrymen. Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, 
turning its back on our patriotic proposals and magnanimous 
efforts since the early stage of the year, is recklessly running 
amok continuously with anticommunist confrontation maneuvers by 
instigating the atmosphere of war. The Kim Yong-sam clique is 
indeed a group of rash war maniacs. 
  [Kim Myong] It goes without saying that the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique is a group of war maniacs. This was proven by a 
single fact that it increased 1994 military expenses -- 
so-called national defense expenditures -- to 10 trillion won. 
As shown by this, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique increased the 
scale of 1994 military expenses by 9.6% from last year, thus 
amounting to more than 10 trillion won. 
  [Kim Sang-ul] I think it is the first time that the amount 
of South Korean military expenses has exceeded 10 trillion won. 
What do you think? 
  [Kim Myong] You are right. Even under the oppressive 
military dictatorship of the Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u military 
fascist clique, so-called military expenses were not increased 
on such a drastic scale. This again proves clearly that traitor 
Kim Yong-sam is a warmonger outshining former military 
dictators. It is not difficult to imagine how frantically 
traitor Kim Yong-sam will run amok with reckless war provocation 
maneuvers against fellow countrymen this year by spending a 
greater amount of money. 
  [Kim Sang-ul] That is right. From the beginning of this 
year, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has been running wild with 
military provocation maneuvers by making violent gun 
powder-reeking remarks. 
  On 21 January, traitor Kim Yong-sam visited the puppet 
Defense Ministry as part of his annual inspection tour and 
handed out a so- called instruction. This rascal made violent 
bellicose remarks there, such as establishment of a new national 
defense policy, strengthening of quality-oriented military 
power, and so forth. On the other hand, the Kim Yong-sam clique 
staged frantic war exercises aimed at a northward invasion in 
South Korean areas with outside forces and constantly 
perpetrated grave military provocations along the demarcation 
line area. 
  [Kim Myong] The civilian regime cannot be consistent with 
war. The puppet regime, composed of bellicose elements who 
pursue war, cannot be called a civilian government. The Kim 
Yong-sam puppet regime is driving North-South relations into a 
grave aspect by aggravating confrontation and tension. As long 
as this regime remains intact, national interest will be 
infringed upon more seriously, and the whole nation will suffer 
nuclear disaster and will inevitably become the victim of big 
powers. 
  Stressing that nothing can be hoped for and expected from 
the 
Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, the people from all walks of life in 
South Korea courageously rose in an antigovernment struggle by 
upholding the slogan calling for the overthrow of the Kim 
Yong-sam regime. It is quite natural. The Kim Yong-sam puppet 
regime, which betrayed the nation and turned its back on the 
people, should be deservedly overthrown. 
  [Kim Sang-ul] You are right. Officers and men of the South 
Korean Army should not blindly follow the order of the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique, which has frantically run amok with war 
maneuvers since the beginning of the year. They should precisely 
look straight at the trend of the time and should join the 
fierce step of the people to achieve peace and peaceful 
reunification of the nation through great unity of the whole 
country. They should no longer be driven into such war exercises 
that go counter to the nation.

<F P=106> [From the "Hour for Officers and Men of the South Korean </F>
Armed Forces" program: "Which Road Must One Walk Along?"] 
  [Text] Officers and men of the Armed Forces: As you know, 
49 years have passed since the division of our nation. It is 
indeed a heartbreaking and intolerable national shame that our 
nation, which has lived in harmony with Tangun as the founder, 
sharing one blood and creating a 5,000-year history, has been 
suffering from national division by outside forces for a long 
time. 
  Thus, in the fifth year of this decade [referring to 1994], 
the whole nation is accelerating the grand march of 
reunification more than any other time and is upholding the 
banner of great national unity. The Kim Yong-sam puppets, 
however, who put out the signboard of a civilian government, are 
rushing in the opposite direction along the road of treachery 
and antireunification. 
  The rascals have viciously carried out reckless maneuvers 
for 
a northward aggressive war rupturing all North-South dialogue 
and have committed unforgivable serious crimes, such as 
trampling the North-South agreement, which was already adopted 
and about to come into effect. In the meantime, they are 
recklessly running wild to harm fellow countrymen by picking on 
us with the nonexistent nuclear issue with outside forces. 
  This year, traitor Kim Yong-sam is still walking along the 
road of treachery and is in the fever of the maneuver for an 
aggressive war. The rascals, who have conducted northward 
aggressive war exercises every day in various parts of South 
Korea since the beginning of the new year, mobilized military 
forces of the puppet Capital Defense Command a few days ago and 
conducted war exercises day and night three times in areas 
adjacent to Mt. Umyon in Seoul, driving residents in fear and 
horror by firing guns and shells at random. 
  Due to such maneuvers of aggressive war of the Kim Yong-sam 
puppets, North-South relations are being further aggravated and 
more and bigger obstacles are piling up on the road of 
reunification, which is the greatest long-cherished desire of 
the nation. 
  Facing the severe situation, officers and men of the Armed 
Forces should think deeply when putting their hands on their 
breasts. On which road are we walking? What is the road 
following Kim Yong-sam, the flunkyist nation-seller second to 
none in the world and the most vicious antireunification 
element, that you are still walking along? 
  The more you think, the more you cannot resist the shame of 
walking along the road of treachery following the traitor Kim 
yong-sam, who trampled the nation's dearly long-cherished desire 
of reunification and who is running wild to harm fellow 
countrymen with a mouthful of blood. 
  All people want to spend their youth, the most precious time 
of life, valuably. The glory of youth ultimately lies in the 
devotion to the country and the nation. 
  Officers and men of the Armed Forces: The whole nation has 
come to vigorously advance along the grand march of 
reunification in the nineties. As young men born with the blood 
of the Korean nation, you should resolutely part from the Kim 
Yong-sam puppets and boldly come out to actively contribute to 
the cause of national reunification. 
  At present, there is no greater devotion to the country and 
the people than for Koreans to sacrifice themselves for national 
reunification. When officers and men of the Armed Forces 
vigorously walk in step with the nation's strong grand march of 
reunification, their value of life will shine on and they will 
live in endless happiness even after the reunification, amid the 
nation's respect and love being highly appraised as the ones who 
contributed to the feat of reunification. 
  When officers and men of the Armed Forces become deeply 
conscious of the national duty they are entrusted with and walk 
along the road of devotion to the country and the people with 
firm unity under the banner of the great national unity, the 
greatest long-cherished national desire of the fatherland 
reunification will thereby be expedited.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Traitor Kim Yong-sam's Fascist Crackdown" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today hits out at the undisguised repressive moves of 
the traitor Kim Yong-sam who encouraged the puppet police to a 
bloody crackdown on the people, insulting the righteous struggle 
of South Korean peasants and other people to defend the rice 
market, the foundation of existence for the fellow countrymen. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam showed up at the "Seoul City 
office" 
on February 7 and, talking about "the complexion of the recent 
demonstration", blared that "violence against police would never 
be tolerated" and that the "home minister" and the "police 
agency director" must "counter violence relentlessly". 
  Recalling this, the news analyst says: 
  How can a democratic and peaceful rally and demonstration 
intended to prevent the treacherous rice market opening and 
defend the nation's dignity and right to existence be called 
"violence"? 
  It is the "civilian" fascist group, not the innocent 
peasants 
and citizens, that became riotous in actuality. When a 
demonstration of peasants and citizens broke out, the traitor 
Kim Yong-sam branded it as an "impermissible violence" and 
issued a ruthless repressive order, bruising many demonstrators. 
  As stark facts show, the real violence is the brutal 
crackdown of the fascist clique which fired multiple tear gas 
and brandished the sword against the barehanded peaceful 
demonstrators, and the chief culprit in it is the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam himself. 
  The traitor Kim, a puppet, has sold off to the United States 
the rice market on which he had staked his "presidency" in 
return for the "international cooperation system" intended to do 
harm to fellow countrymen. He is, indeed, a rare traitor who 
deserves a stern punishment by the nation for his arch crimes. 
  Suppression is by no means almighty. Fascist suppression 
will only result in digging his own grave, being an act of 
self-destruction. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must stop cracking down on the 
righteous struggle of peasants and other sections of people 
against the rice market opening, promptly release the arrested 
peasants and other demonstrators and step down without delay as 
demanded by the South Korean people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- The North side 
headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for 
the Country's Reunification Friday made public a statement today 
condemning the South Korean puppet clique for suppressing the 
patriotic turnout of peasants and students against rice market 
opening. 
  The powerful massive struggle of South Korean peasants and 
students, largest in scale after the appearance of the "civilian 
government", was an explosion of the indignation and grievances 
against the group of Kim Yong-sam, the traitor for all ages, 
which is trying to extend its power by selling off the vital 
rights of the people and a just patriotic action for defending 
the dignity and interests of the nation, the statement said, and 
went on: 
  The Kim Yong-sam group of anti-national hooligans is heading 
for more grave crimes by resorting to a sanguinary repression 
against innocent peasants and students who have risen up against 
the treacherous opening of the rice market. 
  And the traitor Kim Yong-sam, in conspiracy with the United 
States, is going to raise all over South Korea a row of 
deployment of "Patriot" missiles. This is an extension of the 
move to open the rice market and its enlarged version. 
  All the facts show that, with the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique 
left in power, the lives of the South Korean people, let alone 
their vital rights, cannot be preserved and no one can vouch 
that the whole nation may not suffer a horrible disaster. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam must settle his crimes against the

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today condemns the unending arrests of patriotic 
students in South Korea in the new year as a heinous challenge 
to the patriotic force which calls for independence, democracy 
and reunification. 
  Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique recently 
arrested Kim Yong-ha who was chairman of the committee for 
national Reunification of the former "National Council of 
Student Representatives (Chondaehyop)" and Ho Hon-chun, a 
fourth-year student of Chonpuk National University who was 
chairman of the South side's headquarters of the National 
Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification 
(Pomchonghaknyon) at the time of the first joint presidium 
meeting of Pomchonghaknyon, the news analyst says: 
  The students thrown behind bars by the puppet clique have 
done nothing guilty. It is, to all intents and purposes, a 
praiseworthy patriotic deed for the students in the North and 
the South and abroad who were born in a divided territory to 
exchange greetings though by correspondence and on the phone and 
vow to bring earlier the morning of national reunification. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, did not cease to 
arrest patriotic students in the new year, too. This tells that 
they overshadow the preceding military fascist dictators in 
suppressing the people stubbornly and maliciously. 
  Either the independence and democratization of South Korean 
society or peace and Reunification of the country cannot be 
realized while the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is left intact, a 
group of traitors who are brandishing the fascist sword against 
pro-reunification patriotic forces at home and are engaged in 
confrontation and war rackets against the fellow countrymen 
abroad. 
  The South Korean students and people who aspire after 
independence, democracy and reunification will certainly bring 
down a sledge hammer to bear upon the traitorous clique of Kim 
Yong-sam, a dyed-in-the-wool fascist dictator, separatist and 
warmaniac.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The central 
guidance committee of the Korean Chondoists Association in a 
statement today vehemently denounced the Kim Yong-sam group for 
blocking the patriotic initiative and contact of Chondoists in 
the North and the South to jointly celebrate the centenary of 
the historical Kabo Peasant War in 1894, branding its tricky 
move as an unpardonable fascist outrage of the treacherous 
regime that claims to be "civilian", as an anti-national 
criminal act against independence, democracy and reunification. 
  The statement said the "nuclear problem" raised by the Kim 
Yong-sam group with the aim of blocking a contact between 
representatives of Chondoists in the North and the South and 
frustrating a joint celebration of the centenary of the Kabo 
Peasant War is a shameless sophism that can convince no one. 
  "Impermissible is any act of trampling upon the patriotic 
intention of the Chondoists in the North and the South, and the 
Kim Yong-sam puppet group which is engaged in flunkeyist 
treacheries and nation-splitting moves must be removed in South 
Korea at an early date," said the statement. 
  It held that the patriotic initiative of the Chondoists in 
the North and the South to celebrate the centennal of the 1894 
Kabo Peasant War as a common festival of the nation in keeping 
with the expectation and hope of all the fellow countrymen must 
be realized under all circumstances. 
  It expressed the hope that the South Korean Chondoists would 
discard any illusion about the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and 
actively turn out in the struggle to sweep away the group of 
traitors by the united efforts of the whole nation like the 
forerunners and martyrs who participated in the Kabo Peasant 
War, and would more vigorously fight to bring the joint 
celebration of the centenary of the war to a success.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The secretary 
general of the new renewal party (Shinseito) of Japan, Ichiro 
Ozawa, spoke ill of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 
his recent Fuji TV appearance, openly revealing Japan's design 
of reinvasion. This comes under fire in MINJU CHOSON today. 
  He maliciously slandered the DPRK's political system and 
spun 
out a string of trash, contending that the DPRK "might take a 
military action" and Japan's "countermeasure should be examined" 
to cope with [word indistinct] of contingency" on the Korean 
peninsula, the analyst says, and goes on: 
  His remarks are an undisguised provocation aimed at 
impairing 
the prestige and dignity of the DPRK and stifling Korean-style 
socialism centred on the popular masses. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' nuclear armament has practically 
reached a danger line. 
  It is not without reason that Japanese scholars themselves 
admit "Japan is fully prepared to possess nuclear weapons." 
  It is clear to everybody that if Japan possessed many 
nuclear 
weapons, it would bring a grave disaster to the Korean people 
and other Asian people. 
  What Ozawa said fully shows what an extent the Japanese 
ruling circles' aggressive design on the DPRK has reached. 
  The Japanese reactionaries are desperately trying to stifle 
our socialist system in league with the United States and South 
Korea. But it is a foolish act. 
  They would be well advised to clearly see the situation, 
give 
up the scheme to [word indistinct] Japanese military power armed 
with nuclear weapons and act with discretion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
dedicate editorial articles to the 15th anniversary of the 
victory of the islamic revolution in Iran. 
  NODONG SINMUN says that the downfall of the dictatorial 
regime and the victory of the revolution in Iran proved again 
the historical truth that reactionaries repressing the 
independence of the popular masses are doomed to downfall and 
the victory of the just cause of the popular masses is 
inevitable. 
  Noting that after the victory of the revolution the Iranian 
people have advanced along the road chosen by them, overcoming 
the manifold difficulties and trials, the paper says: 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran is pursuing independent foreign 
policy. The Iranian people are opposed to all sorts of 
domination and submission and are developing the friendly and 
cooperative relations with different countries of the world. 
They are striving to ensure peace and security in the Perusian 
Gulf. 
  The Korean people extend full support and solidarity for the 
struggle of the Iranian people to accelerate economic 
reconstruction and improve the looks of the country. 
  The bonds of friendship and cooperative relations between 
Korea and Iran are continuously strengthening and developing. 
The development of these excellent relations is beneficial to 
the building of a new society in the two countries and conducive 
to promoting friendship and solidarity of the Asian people and 
regional development. 
  Korea-Iran friendship will continue to consolidate and 
develop as in the past. 
  The Korean people wish the Iranian people greater success in 
their work to build an independent and prosperous new Iran,

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "15 Years for Struggle and Advance"] </F>
  [Text] The 15th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic 
revolution in Iran will be marked on 11 February. On 11 
February 1979, the Iranian people, who desired a new life, rose 
up in all out resistance against monarchism and overturned the 
dictatorial emperor regime. This was a momentous event in the 
history of the Iranian people. 
  Iran is situated between the Persian Gulf and the Caspian 
sea 
on the Asian continent. The victory of the revolution in Iran 
ended the monarchical politics that had imposed feudal 
oppression upon the people, thus laying a foundation for 
constructing an independent new society. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has declared: Since the 
victory of the revolution, the Iranian people have bravely 
overcome various difficulties and tribulations, consolidated the 
achievements of the Islamic revolution, actively struggled to 
defend peace and security in the Persian Gulf area. 
  The 15 years that the Iranian people have traversed since 
the 
victory of the revolution have been years of struggle to brave 
all difficulties and tribulations, defend the achievements of 
the revolution, and promote the independent development of the 
country. 
  During this period, the Iranian people have effected a 
success in bravely smashing the moves of intervention and 
destruction by the imperialists and reactionaries, removing the 
old remnants of the monarchical era, and struggling for social 
progress and development. 
  Today, the Iranian people have put great efforts into 
achieving national political stability and economic 
self-reliance. They have paid deep attention to developing 
industrial development. 
  A large amount of underground resources, including crude 
oil, 
natural gas, ores, coal, and chrome, is buried in this country. 
Extraction of crude oil has been the base of the Iranian 
economy. Natural gas and crude oil account for approximately 80 
percent of this country's income and approximately 90 percent of 
the acquisition of foreign currency. 
  In addition, Iran has put efforts to develop light industry, 
including the textile and foodstuff industries. Wheat farming 
is a major agricultural crop in Iran. Iran grows barley, rice, 
millet, and cotton. 
  The Iranian Government has externally participated in the 
nonaligned movement and has maintained the principle for 
nonintervention in internal affairs. The Iranian Government has 
developed relations with other countries based on the principle 
of mutual respect in international relations 
  Our people have rejoiced over the Iranian people's success 
in 
the construction of a new society -- like our own success. 
Korea and Iran are Asian countries together and members of the 
nonaligned movement. 
  The friendly relations between our people and the Iranian 
people have been favorably and have been developing daily. 
Visits by each country's delegations have been frequent and 
cooperation and exchanges have been developing in various fields. 
  The Iranian people have highly appraised the success that 
our 
people, upholding the great leader, have effected in socialist 
construction under the wise leadership of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. The Iranian people have positively 
supported the peace-loving proposals and lines of our party and 
the Republic Government for the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country. 
  Developing friendly relations between our two countries is 
beneficial to the interests of the two countries' people, a new 
Asian construction, and strengthening and developing the 
nonaligned movement. 
  As in the past, our people will value the friendly and 
cooperative relations with the Iranian people for the sake of 
independence, peace, and friendship and will actively make 
efforts to strengthen and develop cooperative relations. 
  Our people hope that the Iranian people will achieve greater 
success in the work to construct an independent and an advanced 
Iran.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held 
in Nepal on January 31 on the occasion of the first anniversary 
of the publication of a joint statement of the Workers' Party of 
Korea and the Nepal Worker-Peasant Party. Prem Suwal, 
secretary of the Nepal Worker-Peasant Party, said in his report 
at the meeting that the two parties have since the publication 
of the joint statement intensified their joint struggle against 
imperialism and revisionism, firmly maintaining the socialist 
line in keeping with the common idea and principle and tightened 
the bonds of comradely and militant unity and cooperation in 
this struggle. 
  He went on: 
  "The Nepal Worker-Peasant Party and the Workers' Party of 
Korea agreed on the joint statement in order that they keep to 
the socialist line under the banner of independence against 
imperialism. 
  "Now the imperialist reactionaries are resorting to heavier 
pressure and threat, getting noisier in their anti-socialist and 
anti-DPRK campaign. But the Korean people firmly armed with the 
chuche idea are tightly adhering to the socialist line, not 
wavering in face of all moves of the enemies, with the leader, 
the party and the masses closely united in one mind. This is 
entirely just. 
  "The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year 
address indicated the fundamental principles and ways of the 
solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. He 
warned that pressure and threat would not lead to a solution of 
the problem but bring a catastrophe, and called for defending 
the sovereignty of the country more firmly and meeting all the 
challenges of the enemies resolutely. 
  "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is unswervingiy 
advancing under the banner of socialism, defying ever more 
undisguised moves of the imperialist forces to isolate and 
stifle it. The secret to its might lies in its firm adherence 
to independence."

<F P=106> ["Great Exploits Performed by WPK in Carrying Cause of </F>
Chuche Through to Accomplishment"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 13 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today stresses that dear Comrade Kim Chong-il 
is an illustrious leader who has performed immortal feats for 
the times and the revolution, for the country and the people in 
the course of carrying the cause of socialism through to 
accomplishment. 
  It quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as saying: 
  "Comrade Kim Chong-il enjoys respect and love of the people 
and has high authority as a people's leader for his leadership 
ability and traits, for his loyalty and devotion and for the 
exploits he has performed." 
  The article says: 
  The greatness of exploits performed by the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il for the times and the revolution, for the 
country and the people lies in that they are a revolutionary 
wealth crystallizing his steadfast determination and will to 
carry the revolutionary cause of chuche through to 
accomplishment and that he has performed them with the people 
and entirely for their sake, containing immensely profound and 
rich content. 
  The dear leader has oriented all his thinking and activities 
to the work of firmly defending and exalting the revolutionary 
exploits of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. It is the 
inexorable principle of the dear leader to work out a strategy 
and tactics on the basis of the great chuche idea, to establish 
a work method and style after the great leader's method and 
style of work and lead the economic construction according to 
the plan and intention of the great leader. 
  The feats performed by the dear leader are unprecedented in 
the history of any great persons in the East and the West for 
all ages in their scope and influence on all domains of the 
revolution and construction. The footmarks of energetic 
leadership of the dear leader are imprinted on any field and 
domain of the revolution and construction in our country. 
  What profound, many-sided and rich content his revolutionary 
activities and feats contain is eloquently proved by the works 
he has published. 
  A large number of immortal, monumental works published by 
him 
in the course of triumphantly leading the revolution and 
construction give comprehensive answers to all the theoretical 
questions in the revolutionary practice of our era, including 
the questions of building the party and the state, the question 
of economic and cultural construction and the question of 
building Armed Forces. 
  The course of his revolutionary activities is a brilliant 
chronicle of a genuine people's leader who takes infinite 
pleasure in the people's happiness. In the process of shaping a 
history of popular politics and leadership with his noblest 
virtues, he has built the party into a mother party, made the 
power serve the people and built and developed the economy and 
culture, too, to suit the demands and interests of the masses. 
  The greatness of the exploits performed by Comrade Kim 
Chong-il for the times and the revolution, for the country and 
the people also lies in that they are assets of eternal value 
which would display their everlasting vitality not only for the 
present but in the distant future. 
  When setting forth once idea and theory and shaping a line 
and policies, he looks ahead to the distant future and unfolds a 
grand blueprint to completely realize the independence of the 
working masses. 
  Indeed, the feats performed by the dear leader in the course 
of carrying the revolutionary cause of chuche through to 
accomplishment are great ones which could be performed only by 
an extraordinary thinker and theoretician, politician and 
outstanding military strategist intensely loyal to the cause of 
socialism and the people, a genuine people's leader with noble 
virtues. 
  The article stresses: 
  For the whole party, all the people and the Army to uphold 
the party's leadership, united in one mind, is a decisive 
guarantee of firmly defending the immortal leadership exploits 
of Comrade Kim Chong-il and glorifying them for ever. 
  It is the greatest of exploits performed by the dear leader 
for our country and revolution that he has turned the whole 
party, all the people and the army into the strong motive force 
of revolution firmly united in one mind and will. 
  With this great singlehearted unity, our people have strong 
guts and have nothing to be afraid of.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Upholding The Great Leader Is a </F>
Decisive Guarantee for Inheriting and Completing the Socialist 
Cause] 
  [Text] Today our revolution is vigorously advancing along 
the single road of chuche. Even now, after a long time has 
passed since our revolution was pioneered, our revolution 
constantly and victoriously advances. This is because the issue 
of inheriting the leadership has been brilliantly resolved and 
because we have upheld the great leader [yongdoja] as the head 
of party and the revolution. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The issue 
of inheriting the leadership has already been brilliantly 
resolved in our country, because Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely 
led the overall work of the party, state, and Army for a long 
time. 
  The way to inherit the generation of revolution is an 
important matter related to the destiny of the revolutionary 
cause of the working class -- the socialist cause. The 
socialist cause is an historic cause that can be carried out 
generation after generation. Therefore, the working class party 
and people must firmly inherit the generation of revolution to 
achieve the socialist cause. 
  The fundamental question in inheriting the generation of 
revolution is to firmly guarantee the inheritance of leadership. 
The prospect of the revolutionary cause of the working class -- 
the socialist cause -- depends on how to inherit the leadership 
of the leader [suryong]. 
  The leader [suryong] occupies an absolute position and plays 
a decisive role in the revolutionary struggle of the working 
class. As the leader [yongdoja] plays a decisive role in the 
struggle for independence, he also plays a decisive role in the 
revolutionary struggle -- the struggle to adhere to independence 
and to completely achieve it -- which has continued generation 
after generation. 
  To consummate the revolutionary cause pioneered by the 
leader 
[suryong] and to firmly inherit the generation of revolution, 
therefore, we must brilliantly resolve the issue of inheriting 
the leadership. 
  The historical lesson of the recent collapse of socialism in 
some countries shows that correctly resolving the issue of 
inheriting the leadership is a fundamental question in endlessly 
consummating the revolution generation after generation and that 
the success of the revolution depends on it. 
  In the revolutionary cause of the working class, the issue 
of 
inheriting the leadership is, in essence, a matter of inheriting 
the position and role of the political leader [chongchijok 
suryong], who pioneered the road of revolution. As the 
revolution guides the historical inheritance, the 
leadership-oriented position and role of the leader [suryong] 
must be inherited without change. 
  The working class party and people must uphold the people's 
leader [chidoja], who is endlessly loyal to the party, the 
revolution, the fatherland, and the people, and who has a noble 
character and capacity to satisfactorily carry out political 
leadership throughout society. For the people who struggle to 
inherit and consummate the socialist cause, there is no other 
greater luck than to uphold and follow the leadership of the 
leader [yongdoja], who is absolutely trusted by the popular 
masses because of his immortal achievements based on his 
brilliant wisdom, outstanding leadership ability, and noble 
virtues. 
  Today the issue of inheriting the leadership has been 
brilliantly resolved in our country. This is because we firmly 
uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the supreme head 
of the party and the revolution. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the outstanding 
thinker and theoretician, the great politician, and military 
strategist, as well as the people's true leader [chamdaun 
yongdoja] who is boundlessly loyal to the party, the revolution, 
the fatherland, and the people. Our people are now overflowing 
with a boundless national dignity and pride of carrying out the 
revolution under the leadership of the dear comrade leader, thus 
having confidence in the final victory of the chuche cause by 
the leadership of the leader [suryong], who is brilliantly 
inheriting and consummating the chuche revolutionary cause 
generation after generation, thus upholding the high intent of 
the great comrade leader [suryong]. 
  The dear comrade leader's leadership traits are truly very 
prominent. These traits include boundless loyalty to the party 
and the revolutionary cause, a spirit of devoted service to the 
fatherland and the people, unparalleled courage and will, 
extraordinary organizational ability, and leadership ability. 
  Today the dear comrade leader is absolutely trusted by the 
people because he has gained immortal achievements in the 
revolution and construction with his best qualities and 
characters as the true leader of the people. 
  The dear comrade leader has strengthened and developed our 
party and the revolutionary ranks into the invincible ranks of 
single-hearted unity and opened a great golden age in all fields 
of the socialist construction, including politics, economy, and 
culture. With his energetic, ideological, and theoretical 
activities and his practical struggle, he has also gained 
achievements which will shine in the world for the fatherland, 
the people, and the revolution without sleep or rest. 
  Under the experienced and tested leadership of the dear 
comrade leader, our revolution is firmly and constantly 
advancing along the road of the chuche idea pioneered by the 
great leader [suryong]. Today the issue of inheriting the 
leadership has been brilliantly resolved and the generation of 
revolution has also been firmly succeeded in our country. This 
is because we have firmly established the leadership system that 
can successfully achieve the dear comrade leader's leadership. 
  To endlessly inherit and consummate the revolution, the 
leadership system that can achieve the dear comrade leader's 
leadership must be thoroughly established along with the 
upholding of the great leader [yongdoja]. 
  Today the system that can achieve the dear comrade leader's 
leadership has been firmly established in our country. As a 
result, the revolution and construction are being successfully 
carried out as demanded and intended by the great leader 
[suryong]. Because of the thorough establishment of the party's 
leadership system, today the ideology and intent of the leader 
[yongdoja] have been timely conveyed and penetrated into the 
entire party and the whole society; an iron-like discipline in 
which the entire party, the whole country, and all people move 
as one by firmly uniting around the leader [yongdoja] has been 
established; and the revolution and construction have been 
vigorously accelerated under the monolithic leadership of the 
leader [yongdoja]. 
  The entire party, the whole country, and all people will 
breath and act as demanded by the ideology and will of their 
leader [yongdoja], no matter where and what they work. If it is 
the intent of the party and the leader, they will even move 
mountains and fill up the sea with earth. This faith of loyalty 
and the spirit of the single-hearted unity are firmly being 
filled throughout a society. 
  This firmly proves that our revolution will firmly maintain 
its life in the future, too, along the road of the chuche idea 
under the leadership of the dear comrade leader, and that it can 
be inherited and consummated generation after generation. The 
proud history of our revolution and today's reality tells us the 
noble truth that for the working class party and people to 
firmly inherit the generation of revolution, they must uphold 
the people's true leader, who can brilliantly inherit and 
consummate the revolutionary cause pioneered by the leader 
[suryong], and thoroughly establish his leadership system. 
  Because the dear comrade leader is leading our party and the 
revolution, the generation of our revolution has been strongly 
inherited and the victory in the chuche cause has been firmly 
guaranteed. Because of his leadership, our revolution is 
vigorously advancing forever along the single road of chuche 
pioneered by the great leader [suryong]. Also, the victory and 
glory will be laid in the future road of socialism of our own 
style. This spirit is a firm faith, as well as the will of our 
people who have cherished it deep in their hearts. Firmly 
inheriting the generation of revolution by upholding the great 
leader [yongdoja] is the great dignity, pride, and luck of our 
party and people. 
  All party members and working people must vigorously 
struggle 
to consummate the chuche revolutionary cause, the socialist and 
communist cause, by cherishing boundless national dignity and 
revolutionary pride.

of a people's leader on the highest level, always shapes 
politics of love and trust in the people by fully embodying the 
great leader's idea "believe in the people as in heaven".

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- Symposiums were 
held at the Ministry of People's Armed Forces and the Ministry 
of Public Security to mark the 20th anniversary of the 
proclamation of the programme of modelling the whole society on 
the chuche idea. 
  Speakers at the symposium held at the Ministry of People's 
Armed Forces said that the policy of modelling the whole Army on 
the chuche idea which Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of 
the Korean People's Army, put forward by applying the programme 
of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea to Army 
building is a programme of Army building, the first of its kind 
in the history of the building of the revolutionary Armed Forces 
of the working class, and a great programme which makes is 
possible to successfully accomplish through generations the 
chuche cause of Army building pioneered by the respected leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  Noting that the programme of modelling the whole Army on the 
chuche idea is an immortal militant banner that must be 
constantly upheld by our People's Army, they said this is 
because the programme clearly indicates the general aim of 
building the revolutionary Armed Forces of the working class, 
the aim of imbuing the revolutionary Army with the revolutionary 
idea of the leader, and thus makes it possible to build up the 
People's Army into the Army of the leader and the Army of the 
party, both nominally and virtually, and the revolutionary Army 
flawless in its political and military appearance. 
  The speakers at the symposium held at the Ministry of Public 
Security said that Comrade Kim Chong-il has built up the public 
security organ into loyal ranks imbued with the chuche idea and 
singleheartedly united around the party and the leader, into 
invincible ranks with spiritual and moral traits and qualities 
as political defenders of the party by successfully applying the 
policy of modelling the whole Army on the chuche idea to public 
security. 
  The vitality of this great feat performed by the dear leader 
is clearly proved in the fact that the public security organ is 
smashing all manoeuvres of the enemy at every step and reliably 
defending the security of the party, the state and the people in 
the practice of the class struggle in our country, under the 
rapidly changing world situation today, the speakers noted.

Teng-hui Friday met his Indonesian counterpart Suharto during a 
lunch kept under tight wraps, a source here said. 
  "They had lunch together at the presidential palace in 
Tampaksiring and a meeting was held after the lunch," the source

  The meeting between the two leaders, at the summer palace 
built by founding president Sukarno and overlooking the sacred 
Hindhu bathing place and temple of Tampaksiring, was closed to 
the press, journalists in Bali said by telephone. 
  The Taiwanese president flew to Bandung in West Java on 
Thursday where he played golf and visited the state-owned 
Nusantara National Aircraft Industry (IPTN) accompanied by its 
president, Research and Technology Minister Bacharudin Jusuf 
Habibie. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Denpasar, Indonesia, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Taiwan's 
president, Li Teng-hui, held a closed meeting with Indonesian 
Research and Technology Minister Bacharuddin Habibie at this 
resort island of Bali Thursday, a source said here. "The meeting 
was totally closed for journalists," the source said, adding 
that the meeting was supposed to have been held at the isolated 
hotel where Li was staying. Habibie, who is known to have strong 
support from President Suharto to develop the country's 
technology industry, met Li in his capacity as a scientist, 
officials here have said. 
  The Indonesian minister, who also heads the country's ten 
strategic industries, including aircraft manufacturer IPTN, has 
said that during his talks with Li, he would try to sell IPTN 
products to Taiwan. Habibie said IPTN's technology was more 
advanced in producing civilian aircraft while Taiwan's 
aeronautical industry stressed the manufacture of military 
aircraft. Therefore, he said, the aviation industries of the two 
countries were not contemplating cooperation. [passage omitted] 
  Indonesian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that Li's visit 
would change Indonesia's one-China policy and that any meeting 
between Li and Indonesian officials, including President 
Suharto, were in their respective private capacities and 
therefore should not be "exaggerated." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui left Bali at about 0855 
Central Indonesian Standard Time [0055 GMT] this morning, 
concluding a vacation in Indonesia that began on 9 February. 
President Li Teng-hui left Indonesia for an undisclosed 
destination aboard China Airlines Flight No. B-106. It is not 
yet known whether he will return home or stop in another ASEAN 
country. 
  Reports from Denpasar say that Li Teng-hui and the members 
of 
his delegation -- estimated at 35, including a number of 
ministers -- stayed at the Bali Clear Resort near the Nusa Dua 
tourist resort. 
  There have been no official statements on the Taiwan 
president's activities during his stay in Bali because his visit 
was merely a vacation. In addition, Indonesia has no diplomatic 
relations with Taiwan; it follows a one-China policy.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 14 (ANTARA) -- The Embassy of the 
People's Republic of China in Indonesia made an official 
statement here Monday, expresing China's regret over the visit 
of Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui to Indonesia. The statement 
said that Li's visit, although in the name of "holiday making," 
was actually aimed at developing substantive relations with 
Indonesia and to create a situation of "two Chinas" in the world. 
  The five-day visit which began Feb. 9 violated Indonesia's 
commitment on the "one-China policy" undertaken at the time when 
diplomatic relations between Indonesia and China were resumed. 
  The China Government has lodged a strong protest against the 
Indonesian Goverment on the incident. The embassy statement 
further said the China Government hoped that the Indonesian 
Government would uphold overall interest in safeguarding the 
Sino-Indonesian friendly relations and cooperation. They also 
called for efforts to stand on-guard against the political 
designs of the "southward policy" pursued by the Taiwan 
authorities.

<F P=106> [By Jakarta correspondent Paul Jacob] </F>
  [Excerpts] Jakarta -- The independent SBSI labour union 
claimed partial success in rallying workers and supporters 
behind its call for a one-hour work stoppage across the country 
yesterday, but observers here considered the exercise a failure. 
  The union said preventive action by the authorities -- 
including alleged intimidation of organisers and the detention 
of its chairman -- thwarted wider participation in the strike, 
called to demonstrate the extent of its support nationwide and 
its recognition as a trade union. 
  The Sejahtera (Prosperity) Indonesian Trade Union (SBSI) was 
also calling for improved labour practices and higher wages. 
  The authorities refused to recognise the union -- a rival of 
the government-backed SPSI [All Indonesia Workers Union] 
federation -- arguing that it was set up by human rights and 
labour activists not by workers themselves. 
  The SBSI, which was aiming for the support of two million 
people, said feedback from its branches indicated that up to 
750,000 took part. But observers, including diplomats and 
journalists regarded the action as a failure as response from 
workers did not appear to be widespread at least in Jakarta and 
the surrounding industrial towns of Tanggerang and Bekasi. 
  Prayers by religious leaders at central Jakarta's National 
Monument in support of what was to be a peaceful stoppage from 8 
am also did not take place. [passage omitted] 
  The SBSI maintained that the number of members and 
sympathisers who took part in many places, including Solo, 
Medan, Lampung, and Surabaya, demonstrated the support it 
enjoyed nationwide. 
  On Wednesday and Thursday, police and security forces broke 
up what they said were illegal meetings by SBSI members to plan 
yesterday's action. SBSI chairman Mokhtar Pakpahan was among 21 
activists detained after raids. Union vice chairman Rekson 
Silaban said yesterday that 11 had since been freed but Mr. 
Mokhtar remained under detention in Semarang. 
  Mr. Rekson said the union would have met its target of two 
million participants if leaders and organisers in Semarang, 
Bekasi, Tanggerang, and other parts of west Java had not been 
intimidated. He said the union was undeterred and would continue 
with plans for a longer strike on April 1 if labour practices 
did not improve by then. 
  The union would also meet the newly-established Human Rights 
Commission today to seek support in getting Mr. Mokhtar released. 
  Diplomats said it remained to be seen how the government's 
action against the SBSI might affect Indonesia's position with 
Washington. The United States has given Jakarta until February 
15 to improve labour conditions or risk losing trade privileges.

  [Excerpt] Jakarta, Feb 10 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The government 
on Wednesday lifted the visitation ban on former East Timor 
security disturbance movement leader Xanana Gusmao but 
authorities said until late that afternoon he has not received 
anyone in his cell at Cipinang jail. "No one from his family or 
circle of friends paid him a visit in spite of the suspension 
being lifted," confirmed the director-general of social 
rehabilitation Baharuddin Lopa on Wednesday. 
  Visitors wishing to visit him must first be screened by the 
prison guards. Questions are asked on the purpose of the visit 
and they must disclose their relations with Xanana. "The 
exercise is aimed at stopping bonafide visitors who may just 
want to see what Xanana looks like," said Lopa who is also 
secretary-general of the National Commission on Human Rights. 
  When asked about the decision to allow former dissident and 
chairman of the Indonesian Law Aid Foundation (YLBHI), Adnan 
Buyung Nasution, to visit Xanana, Lopa said the case was still 
under consideration. "Nasution's letter of request is with the 
justice minister and he alone can grant the permission."

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- Japan's Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata returned to the negotiating table with 
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in the early hours 
Friday [11 February], keeping hopes alive for a last-minute 
breakthrough on the ongoing trade dispute with Washington prior 
to the U.S.-Japan summit Friday morning. 
  "There is always room for mutual concessions," Hata told 
reporters as he showed up at Kantor's office for the meeting, 
their third round of talks since Thursday morning. 
  Hata returned to face the top U.S. trade negotiator after a 
round of consultations with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, 
who arrived in Washington Thursday evening for the summit 
meeting with President Bill Clinton 
  Negotiators from the two countries have been trying to work 
out an accord by the time the two leaders sit down for talks at 
11:30 A.M. Friday (1:30 A.M. Saturday Japan time.) 
  Prospects of a mutually acceptable accord looked elusive 
throughout Thursday as both countries seemed to harden their 
positions over the so-called "objective criteria" for measuring 
progress in sales of foreign goods and services in Japan. 
  "It is difficult" Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro 
Matsuura told reporters after emerging from the second round of 
talks between Hata and Kantor Thursday evening. 
  U.S. Officials agreed. 
  "I'm sorry to say it doesn't look like we're doing real 
well," U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown told reporters after a 
dinner speech. "I'm not encouraged." 
  Japanese officials said the United States insists on working 
out "objective criteria" -- some kind of measurable goals -- to 
gauge Japan's progress in opening its markets for foreign goods. 
  "Without objective criteria, we can't have a good 
agreement," 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was quoted as saying in a 
separate meeting with Hata Thursday evening. 
  Senior Clinton administration officials have warned that 
Clinton has made it clear he would rather have no agreement than 
"a bad agreement" reached by papering over differences. 
  In between negotiations with Kantor, Hata also took up 
Japan's case -- Tokyo's commitment to open up its markets and 
deregulate its economy -- in separate meetings with Vice 
President Al Gore and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  Hata even took time out from a frenzied schedule for an 
informal dinner meeting with U.S. lawmakers to sound out the 
mood at Capitol Hill, which has increasingly called for a 
get-tough U.S. trade policy with Japan. 
  There was no crack in the responses Hata heard from his U.S. 
hosts. 
  Japanese officials said Gore reiterated the Clinton 
administration's position that "objective criteria" are 
essential for measuring trade results. 
  The controversy stems from an agreement reached between 
Tokyo 
and Washington last July that provides for the use of "objective 
criteria, either qualitative or quantitative," to determine 
whether foreign companies had made headway in penetrating the 
Japanese market. 
  U.S. officials have argued for a "results-oriented" trade 
policy with Japan as past trade agreements have failed to dent 
Japan's global trade surplus, which totaled 130 billion dollars 
last year, almost half of it with the United States. 
  Christopher, talking to reporters before his meeting with 
Hata, emphasized that Washington is determined to change the 
situation. 
  "The United States is determined that we will redress the 
great imbalance in our trade. We will seek in a determined way 
access for American business in the Japanese market," 
Christopher said in a photo-taking session prior to his meeting 
with Hata. 
  The sharp dispute over "objective criteria" was not the only 
problem Hata faced in his encounters with key members of the 
Clinton administration Thursday. 
  Washington also launched a barrage of criticism against the 
15 trillion yen tax cut and government spending plan Tokyo 
announced earlier this week, saying it will be ineffective for 
stimulating the ailing Japanese economy. 
  Japanese officials said Hata heard the U.S. displeasure in 
talks with both Bentsen and Gore. 
  Christopher openly criticized the Japanese economic plan in 
the photo-session with Hata, saying the U.S. is "disappointed" 
with the program. 
  Along with opening markets, Tokyo also pledged last July to 
take macroeconomic measures to stimulate the Japanese economy as 
part of Japan's efforts to reduce its global trade surplus by 
boosting demand for imports. 
  The shape of the Japanese economy is expected to be high on 
the agenda at the Friday meeting between Hosokawa and Clinton.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- Top Japanese and 
U.S. trade negotiators ended a predawn meeting Friday [11 
February] apparently without breaking a deadlock on how to 
measure imports to Japan and leaving the success of the imminent 
U.S-Japan summit in jeopardy. 
  "It remains somewhat difficult," Japan's Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata told reporters after emerging from a three-hour 
meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. 
  Hata said he is not sure whether he and Kantor will 
return to the negotiating table prior to the summit meeting 
between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill 
Clinton. 
  Hata and Kantor resumed the latest round of negotiations, 
their third since Thursday morning, at 1 A.M. Friday in a bid 
to break the deadlock in the ongoing trade talks. 
  "There is always room for mutual concessions," Hata told 
reporters on arrival at Kantor's office, fanning hopes that an 
accord could be coming. 
  Hata returned to face the top U.S. trade negotiator after 
consultations with Hosokawa, who arrived in Washington Thursday 
evening for the summit meeting with Clinton. 
  Negotiators from the two countries have been trying to 
hammer 
out an accord by the time the two leaders sit down for talks at 
11:30 A.M. Friday (1:30 A.M. Saturday Japan time.)

gauge Japan's progress in opening its markets to foreign 
products.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was quoted as saying in a

criteria, either qualitative or quantitative," to determine 
whether foreign companies had made headway in penetrating the 
Japanese market. 
  U.S. officials have argued for a "results-oriented" trade 
policy with Japan as past trade agreements have failed to dent 
Japan's global trade surplus, which totaled 130 billion dollars 
last year, almost half of it with the United States. 
  Christopher, talking to reporters before his meeting with 
Hata, emphasized that Washington is determined to change the 
situation. 
  "The United States is determined that we will redress the 
great imbalance in our trade. We will seek in a determined way 
access for American business in the Japanese market," 
Christopher said in a photo-taking session prior to his meeting 
with Hata. 
  The sharp dispute over "objective criteria" was not the only 
problem Hata faced in his encounters with key members of the 
Clinton administration Thursday. 
  Washington also launched a barrage of criticism against the 
15 trillion yen tax cut and government spending plan Tokyo 
announced earlier this week, saying it will be ineffective for 
stimulating the ailing Japanese economy. 
  Japanese officials said Hata heard the U.S. displeasure in 
talks with both Bentsen and Gore. 
  Christopher openly criticized the Japanese economic plan in 
the photo-session with Hata, saying the U.S. is "disappointed" 
with the program. 
  Along with opening markets, Tokyo also pledged last July to 
take macroeconomic measures to stimulate the Japanese economy as 
part of Japan's efforts to reduce its global trade surplus by 
boosting demand for imports. 
  The shape of the Japanese economy is expected to be high on 
the agenda at the Friday meeting between Hosokawa and Clinton.

<F P=106> [News Conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and </F>
President Bill Clinton with unidentified foreign and domestic 
correspondents at the White House -- live; President Clinton 
speaks in English with simultaneous translation into Japanese] 
  [Text] [Clinton] Helen, may I say one thing before we 
begin: I will call on American journalists first, and the prime 
minister will call on Japanese journalists. This is not a 
numerical target. 
  [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into 
Japanese] I think the Japanese really thought last July that 
they could reach an agreement. Among the industrialized seven 
[G-7] nations, Japan has the most tightly closed market. Why? 
  [Clinton] First of all, the G-7 agreement or the framework 
agreement we signed with Japan last summer, was good. Both 
sides understood that they had to implement the agreement. 
However, the people who signed the agreement last summer are 
not here to fulfill their agreement. I do not mean to say that 
they were lacking sincerity. However, we ourselves could not 
reach an agreement on the basis of the previous agreement. 
  [Same correspondent] Why? 
  [Clinton] We could not agree on what kind of evidence we 
could use to measure market liberalization, for example. 
  [Hosokawa] We understand that we have made some progress on 
the issues of government procurement or insurance services. 
Unfortunately, however, we could not clear the issue of 
numerical targets. We deeply regret that we could not reach an 
agreement on setting numeric targets. As the president said 
earlier, both sides will readjust what we can readjust and try 
to buckle down to the task to reach a better agreement. 
  [Correspondent] When do you think you will reach an 
agreement on what you could not do this time? 
  [Hosokawa] I do not know. As soon as possible, I hope. 
However, we may need time to cool off. 
  [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into 
Japanese] Mr. President, let me ask you a question on the 
Bosnian issue. There is a possibility that there will be 
discord between you and President Yeltsin. He is saying that 
NATO does not have the right to launch air raids on Bosnia. 
But, you are saying that NATO does. Is there a way to fill the 
gap? 
  [Clinton] We talked about it on the phone today. The 
secretary general of the United Nations told President Yeltsin 
that NATO is acting on the basis of the resolution the Security 
Council adopted last summer. In other words, NATO has the 
authority to stop the shelling of Sarajevo. I think NATO will 
remove weapons from areas within a 20-kilometer radius from 
Sarajevo. However, discussions are now underway. Anyhow, this 
will bring about peace in the long run and we agreed, as a 
short-term measure, to stop the act of killing civilians. 
  [correspondent] Now that the trade agreement has failed, 
how optimistic is your administration about the possibility of a 
future agreement? 
  [Clinton] I just do not know. As you know, the problem may 
be a parlance matter or an emotional matter. But, Japan's 
position is that it does not want to set numerical targets that 
may lead to managed trade. I understand their position well. 
We want some kind of objective standards to measure whether 
Japan's market opening is progressing. Without such objective 
criteria -- as in the past -- it is quite difficult to measure 
progress. For that reason, we want to have qualitative or 
quantitative targets. Supposing trade is very imbalanced in the 
period from 1992 to 1995, we need to measure whether progress is 
being made. We also need to see how foreign exchange and 
Japan's economy have turned out, and whether U.S. companies have 
made products which have competitive power in quality and price, 
and attract the Japanese market. For that reason, we have 
stressed that we want objective criteria or standards to measure 
whether progress is being made in opening the market. But we 
have failed to reach an agreement on that point. 
  [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into 
Japanese] My question is about Bosnia. It has been reported 
that the United States said it is willing to give up imposing 
sanctions if the Serbians cooperate in talks on peace. Are you 
planning to send U.S. peacekeeping operation [PKO] troops? What 
will you do about it; and are F-15 fighters heading toward 
Bosnia? 
  [Clinton] In terms of troops, we will send less than half, 
although we have not specified the number. Second, we have 
never discussed any partial lifting of the embargo. As far as I 
am concerned, I have never discussed such a possibility. 
  [Correspondent] Although the previous governments agreed to 
launch negotiations on objective criteria, do you think the 
preceding government made the wrong decision, or does it mean 
that the Hosokawa government will cope with this issue in its 
own, new way? 
  [Hosokawa] Well, we believe that certain progress has been 
made on each issue we have negotiated so far. Therefore, I 
think that it does not mean we will start from scratch, and we 
need to further promote negotiations with the results of past 
negotiations in mind. Does this answer your question? No? 
  [Correspondent] The Miyazawa government decided and agreed 
to start negotiations on objective criteria. What I want to ask 
you is whether you think the Miyazawa government's decision was 
wrong. 
  [Hosokawa] No, I do not think so. Our understanding over 
the issue of numerical targets was different. We could not 
clear up the matter. 
  [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into 
Japanese] Mr. President, what sort of measures do you think 
the United States can take to keep a watch on Japan's attitude 
or manner, and are you thinking of changing the United States' 
position in order to make it difficult for Japanese companies to 
continue business activities in the United States? 
  [Clinton] Until 0400 this morning, we made efforts to come 
to an agreement. So, I am not prepared to say. We need to give 
further study to what you have said. I think now is the time to 
think about many things. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, citizens of Japan strongly 
support the Hosokawa government's policy on deregulation or 
non-interference by the government. When that is the given 
background, if the United States presses Japan to set import 
volumes in advance -- which is tantamount to asking the 
government to interfere -- do you think the citizens of Japan 
will accept this? 
  [Clinton] We are not asking for that. I think that is the 
bottleneck which is making an agreement impossible. We are not 
asking Japan to make a commitment to import certain volumes by 
certain dates. What we want to do is measure progress on market 
opening, using objective criteria. One thing that could be used 
as a criteria is the level of imports, another could be exchange 
rates, another could be Japan's domestic demand, and how many 
U.S. products are being used in the United States, Europe, or 
other countries could be used as criteria as well. 
  What efforts U.S. businesses are making to do business in 
Japan or in the Japanese market could also be used as criteria. 
We are not asking Japan to practice managed trade. I think 
what Japan is concerned about is that if there are numbers among 
other criteria, the numbers will take on a life of their own. 
That is not what the United States intends, even though, no 
doubt, that has become the bottleneck on arriving at an 
agreement. 
  [Correspondent] You two are said to have also talked about 
the situation on the Korean peninsula. Around the end of this 
month, the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] will have 
to confirm or deny whether North Korea is developing nuclear 
arms. How serious is the situation? What will you and Prime 
Minister Hosokawa do if it is determined that North Korea is not 
observing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty? 
  [Clinton] On that question, we discussed various options 
including sanctions. Japan, China, South Korea, and the United 
States agree that the Korean peninsula should be free of nuclear 
arms. The fact that North Korea is unwilling to accept the IAEA 
inspections is a cause of very much concern to us. We will see 
what options we have. But I think it is clear that the 
sanctions are among them. 
  [Hosokawa] We are also strongly concerned over the issue. 
The issue will face a big hurdle soon or within the next 10 
days. I hope that North Korea will move in a desirable 
direction. As the President just said, Japan wants to work 
together with the United States, South Korea, and China in 
working on that country more strongly. If a possible economic 
blockade or sanctions are discussed at the UN Security Council, 
Japan will do as much as it can within the limits of its 
constitution. 
  [Correspondent] I have a question for both of you. To look 
back on the negotiations between the two countries, I feel 
mutual mistrust has grown between them -- the United States 
thinking it has been deceived, and Japan thinking the objective 
criteria will be used in sanctions. Do you think such mistrust 
will be removed in the course of future negotiations? 
  [Clinton] I personally trust Prime Minister Hosokawa, and 
respect him very much. In fact, my respect has only kept on 
growing. I have particular respect for efforts put into 
political reforms, the leadership displayed by Japan in the 
Uruguay Round of talks, and the leadership shown by Prime 
Minister Hosokawa in opening up the rice market. I must note 
efforts made in deregulation and tax reductions. I feel Japan 
is moving in the right direction. 
  Both of us came to our posts as top leaders of the two 
nations when frustration and irritation was rising after years 
and years of trade negotiations. This issue of trust is 
certainly important, and is a serious problem that cannot be 
overlooked. But this issue of trust can be resolved. 
  The reason why the trust is being threatened is because the 
trade imbalance remains large while the prices of consumer goods 
in Japan are high, and because this fact is having a negative 
effect on American citizens. Aside from that, my personal 
respect for the prime minister and the government is great 
indeed. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you have discussed many 
things with President Clinton. The United States is saying that 
even though it wants numerical targets or objective criteria, it 
does not want managed trade. Can you believe this? 
  [Hosokawa] Nobody wants managed trade. This can be said -- 
commonly -- of all countries. As the President mentioned, we 
are afraid lest the numerical targets should take on a life of 
their own. If that happens, as it did with the Semiconductor 
Agreement, that is in fact the practicing of managed trade. I 
told him in today's summit meeting that establishing numerical 
targets runs counter to the basic stance of my cabinet, which 
promotes deregulation. 
  [Clinton] If we were asking for the semiconductor 
agreement, that would be right. But that is not what we are 
asking for. What we are asking for is what we agreed to last 
summer, which was a way of measuring by objective standards the 
progress being made in opening markets. I want to say we are 
not seeking anything for the United States, that we are not 
seeking for other countries as well. We sought no special 
access or special treatment. We just seek a list, if you will, 
of those things by which you could determine whether progress is 
being made or progress is not being made, that there are reasons 
other than closed market policies for the lack of progress. 
There could be other reasons -- no domestic demand, changes in 
exchange rates, inadequate efforts by Americans, uncompetitive 
products and services. 
  [Correspondent] I think that opening the Japanese market is 
very important. I think Japanese consumers and Japanese people 
believe that. But I think the reason you could not come up with 
any agreement today in the talks is that the numerical target 
approach is not really popular among Japanese people, Japanese 
industries, and Japanese bureaucrats. So, I am wondering, Mr. 
President, whether you thought it was possible to come up with 
any agreement, result, or outcome in near future with the 
numerical target approach. I also wonder whether you were 
disappointed with the Japanese people. I heard that Mr. Gore 
raised a question about Japanese bureaucrats in talks with Mr. 
Hata. I wonder whether, Mr. President, you think the Japanese 
bureaucracy is a kind of burden or barrier in opening the 
Japanese market. 
  [Clinton] I wish you had never asked that. I understand 
that numerical targets are not popular among Japanese people and 
the Japanese Government. But Americas trade deficit with Japan 
is not popular among the American people and the American 
Government -- it is hard to explain it, year in and year out, it 
is always getting bigger. I think, in every society, the 
permanent government is more unchangeable than the changing 
government. I think that is true in every society and, in some 
societies, it is more true than in others. And the stronger the 
permanent civil service is in making policy, the more likely 
they are to become unchangeable. If you look at the history of 
Japan after the Second World War, having one system for the last 
forty-five plus years in which you produced for your own market 
and the world, had high savings rates and low consumption rates, 
as well as relatively closed markets and relatively high-value 
products, worked dramatically to improve the living standard of 
your people. But, at some point, as your growth rates became 
more normal as in the last 10 years, and as the capacity and 
desires of your people alter, now you have to develop a more 
open economy and society. I could not say any more than the 
prime minister did in the book that he wrote and gave to me to 
read. So, I do not want to pick on any particular section of the 
Japanese society. I want to just say that we must process the 
change, and we are both committed to it. That is the good news. 
I also think it is good news that we did not come up with an 
agreement today that did not mean anything. We just have to 
keep dealing with the issue and trying to find some way out of 
it, because we have to come to trust each other across systems 
that are still very different. Thank you very much.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- The following is the 
full text of a speech by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at 
Georgetown University in Washington on Friday [11 February]. 
  Thank you President O'Donovan, Distinguished guests, Ladies 
and Gentlemen: 
  I am pleased and honored to have this chance to speak at a 
university which is famous in Japan -- not for its excellent 
basketball, but for the many excellent leaders it has produced. 
My wife and I have special feelings toward Georgetown, because 
of its strong ties with Sophia University in Tokyo, from which 
we both graduated. I am especially happy to see in this audience 
many young people. In a very real sense, I am working for you, 
and for our young generation back home, to help see to it that 
you, and we, have a better future. 
  In this difficult period of global transition, the future is 
very uncertain. America, like most nations -- including mine -- 
has its own serious problems. But America still remains, in many 
ways, a role model. Any country which seeks to build a society 
based on democracy, which seeks to create a better life for its 
people, has much to learn from the American experience. 
  I believe this, because it is part of my own family's 
experience. My wife and I are pleased that our son and daughter 
had the chance to live in America several years ago. Thanks to 
their home stay in small U.S. town, they made new friends, and 
expanded their understanding of what it means to live in a 
society which values individuality and open competition. 
  If one word can sum up this new era, it is "change." 
  Dramatic changes are taking place in the political life of 
the former Soviet Union. Europe has become more integrated than 
over before. And in America, you have new leadership which has 
dedicated itself to change. I would not be speaking to you today 
had not millions of Japanese decided that they wanted basic 
changes in politics. 
  Today, I want to share with you my views on the challenges 
of 
change. I also want to discuss the actions I think Japan should 
take to help create a more stable and prosperous world. As these 
are common goals, U.S.-Japan cooperation has special importance 
in this context. 
  In Japan, we have begun the process of reforming political 
and administrative systems which have become entrenched. As you 
can see by recent headlines, this process is causing us, and me, 
some pain. A story in the Washington Post the other day 
described me as "poker- faced." I don't see myself that way, but 
thinking about recent events, perhaps I do look a bit grim these 
days. It reminds me that Bill Clinton and I have lots in common. 
We've both had our troubles since coming into office. We both 
had our bad days in the media. And we've both had a very tough 
time trying to get people to agree on policy reforms. But just 
as your President is moving ahead, so are we. The problem is the 
pace of change in Japan. It always seems too slow for other 
nations. We also have an image problem - Japan, Incorporated. In 
the case of reform, I wish it were true. But the reality, as you 
have seen in recent days, is that Japanese are always struggling 
among ourselves. And conflicts on reforms have slowed progress. 
But I assure you, we are not only moving ahead, we are committed 
to seeing through our objectives. 
  My goal is to make policy discussion and debate the heart 
of our political life. This reform also is the start of creating 
a more open political process. Public opinion polls show that 
the vast majority of Japanese strongly support my objectives. 
This process is important for another reason. I want to regain 
our people's trust and interest in politics. The reforms are 
only a first step in this direction. But this is still the most 
significant political reform movement in Japan in half a century. 
  Another key objective of our inner-driven reform is market 
deregulation. When I was Governor of Kumamoto prefecture, I 
could see clearly how central government regulations were 
causing wasted time and effort. That is how we are seen in many 
other nations. We should reform our system, and this image of 
Japan. That is why, as prime minister, I am determined to do 
away with regulations which increase the cost of business, and 
cost to the consumers. For example, I would like to see actions 
including deregulations which would allow Japanese to purchase 
homes at about two-thirds the present average cost. 
  Deregulation will help us achieve several objectives. First, 
it will create a more transparent market, with improved access 
for foreign firms. Second, it will lower business costs, which 
will promote imports, and lowering the price of many products. 
Third, it will create a more open and efficient administrative 
system. I intend to become personally involved in this effort, 
by heading a group to promote administrative reform and market 
deregulation. 
  I want to emphasize that we are moving ahead with these 
reforms because they are in our own interest, and also because 
they are in harmony with Japan's international responsibilities. 
That is why, in the Uruguay Round talks, we made the painful 
decision on rice imports. This decision was made to help assure 
a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. This agreement is 
essential if we are to achieve our goals -- sustained, long-term 
economic growth, further liberalized trade, and greater world 
prosperity. 
  A few days ago, we also announced a strong economic 
stimulation package. It includes a major income tax cut. I am 
confident that this action will create stronger consumer demand. 
This also is good news for foreign companies, who will take part 
in a new, open and competitive bidding system for public 
projects. It should also be good news for the rest of the world, 
because this package is an important step toward our common goal 
of expanding world prosperity. If the United States and Japan 
both firmly support their own economic growth policies, closely 
coordinating their actions, I also am certain that the problem 
of external imbalances will be eased. 
  These changes inside Japan have another meaning. They 
symbolize changes in the way Japanese are thinking and acting in 
their relations with other countries. The time has come for 
Japan to play a much more dynamic role in helping to create the 
stable, peaceful world which we all desire. 
  There are a number of areas in which I think Japan should 
become more involved. These include helping prevent and settle 
regional conflicts, helping nations build stable societies and 
helping efforts to cope with global problems such as environment 
and population. 
  In settling regional conflicts, I believe that a 
comprehensive approach is an effective way to replace violence 
with stability. This comprehensive approach should include: 
diplomatic efforts to end conflicts, U.N. peacekeeping 
operations, humanitarian assistance and development assistance 
for rebuilding nations which have been torn apart by violence. 
The successful process which ended the Cambodian conflict was a 
good example of this approach. Japan was an active player at 
each stage of the process. 
  Japan is no longer an international bystander. We are 
committing both materials, and people, to support efforts to 
stabilize trouble spots around the world. Today, for example, 
Japan is helping U.N. peacekeeping operations in Mozambique. In 
March, we plan to send a team of observers to help monitor 
elections in El Salvador. In the Middle East and other trouble 
spots, Japan is ready to play an active role to assist 
international efforts for peace. We also will increase 
humanitarian aid and other support for areas affected by 
conflict in the former Yugoslavia. 
  All these efforts are essential, but there is another, even 
greater challenge. The end of the Cold War has created new 
opportunities for arms control and disarmament. One of Japan's 
major goals is to strengthen the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty] system for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. 
That is why one of the first international policy decisions I 
made after becoming prime minister asserted Japan's strong 
support for the indefinite extension of the NPT beyond 1995. 
  There have been reports in the last few days that Japan 
might 
change its policy should North Korea arm itself with nuclear 
weapons. I wish the people who write such reports would come to 
Japan and talk to our people. Then they would realize how deeply 
we feel about this issue. Let me be very clear on this point: I 
see no possibility that Japan would decide to become a nuclear 
power. Such a policy would be against Japan's national interest. 
We, like you, are very concerned about the current situation on 
the Korean peninsula. And we are determined, working closely 
with government leaders in the Republic of Korea and America, to 
help settle this issue. 
  On the issue of conventional arms control, Japan also is 
actively involved. We are the only major nation in the world 
which is not selling any weapons to other countries. We have 
proposed a U.N.- supervised system to make it easier to monitor 
international sales of conventional arms. We want to broaden 
this system, to make it more effective. 
  Economic assistance is another important action to assure 
long-term global stability and prosperity. In recent years, 
Japan has become the world's largest donor of ODA. Japan is 
actively using economic aid to promote what might be called 
"good governance." We are encouraging recipient nations which 
are making efforts to move toward more democratic government, 
introduce market economies, control military spending, and 
promote policies to control or dispose of weapons of mass 
destruction. Japan's ODA decisions are being strongly influenced 
by countries which follow such policies. 
  As we seek long-term peace and prosperity, we must also 
focus 
on other problems which threaten the well-being of people around 
the world. Coordinated action is essential on four key issues: 
protecting the environment, dealing with population problems, 
stopping the spread of AIDS, ending drugs as a social threat. 
  Two years ago, Japan pledged more than 7 billion dollars in 
ODA funds to support environmental protection programs around 
the world. Since then, Japanese aid to helping to restore forest 
lands in Mexico and Indonesia, supporting the treatment of solid 
waste in Brazil, and supporting research to deal with acid rain 
in China. Environmental protection is also one of the key global 
issues in the framework talks. I want to see ever closer 
cooperation between our nations in this vital area. 
  Today, I informed President Clinton that Japan will pledge 3 
billion dollars over the next seven years to support programs on 
population and AIDS. The president told me that the U.S. 
government will provide 9 billion dollars to deal with these 
problems during the same period. We also want to strengthen 
international cooperation to fight the threat of drugs, and to 
find a cure for cancer. 
  My friends, 
  As we approach the twenty first century, I see many 
opportunities for U.S.-Japan cooperation in the most dynamic 
region in the world, the Asia-Pacific. In the recent APEC 
leaders' meeting in Seattle, President Clinton spoke with 
conviction about the importance of the Asia-Pacific in America's 
future. He made some of same points in a speech during his visit 
to Tokyo last year. I welcome these messages. We need and want 
an active U.S. presence in Asia, in the context of both economic 
and security issues. 
  We strongly support the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and have 
backed up that commitment by providing major financial support 
for U.S. forces in our country. In fiscal 1993, the total was 
4.6 billion dollars. Our ratio of financial support for all U.S. 
base expenses, except salaries, will increase to about 70% by 
fiscal 1995. In the new Asia-Pacific era, U.S.-Japan security 
arrangements remain an essential stabilizing force, in both the 
political and military sense. 
  Coordinated action by our two countries in Asia-Pacific is 
essential if we are to avoid the dangers of isolationism and 
protectionism. We both should encourage China, for example, to 
play a positive role in regional stability. In this sense, I 
support President Clinton's policies to expand contacts with 
China. Dialogue and policy coordination will be essential in 
deepening mutual trust among nations in this region. 
  In the business world, contacts already are becoming much 
closer. And there is a new trend. American and Japanese 
companies, for example, are cooperating in projects to improve 
Indonesia's power generation system. And American and Japanese 
companies are providing technical aid to help develop China's 
auto industry. This kind of synergy shows how APEC members can 
use their special talents to produce results which are, to use 
the American expression, "win- win." 
  Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the end of World 
War II. The Asia-Pacific, once a battlefield, is now one of the 
most promising regions in the world. The bitter memories of 
conflict and destruction half a century ago are a constant 
reminder of the challenges we now face. We must succeed in 
building a new era, based on mutual respect, with the goal of 
creating a peaceful and prosperous future. 
  My friends, 
  For half a century, there have been generally strong, 
positive relations between our nations. I believe that our best 
years lie ahead. 
  Ongoing changes in both countries will help to strengthen 
U.S.- Japan relations. We still have serious economic and trade 
problems to solve. We can do it, but only if we work together in 
a spirit of partnership and mutual trust. we also must guard 
against distorting those problems. We must work to keep our 
relationship balanced, remembering the importance of our close 
cooperation in political, security and global policy matters. 
  We also need to remind each other about the rich, human 
dimension of U.S.-Japan relations. It is not governments, or 
companies, but people, after all, which give a relationship its 
greatest value. Many thousands of Americans and Japanese have 
formed deep and lasting friendships. These are not famous 
people, but the kind of people who are the heart and soul of our 
societies. They include students and scholars, business 
executives and engineers, artists, musicians, athletes, and yes, 
even a few journalists. They live in Washington, and Tokyo...in 
Denver, and Nagoya,...in Miami, and Osaka. They share the same 
values and interests. They and their families also are trying to 
cope with similar problems. But they all have hopes and dreams 
for a better future life. These strong but too often ignored 
human ties between our countries are the best reason for all of 
us to dedicate ourselves to making a good relationship even 
better. That is my goal, and my promise to you.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 12 KYODO -- Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa reaffirmed after fresh talks with 
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Saturday [12 February] the 
collapse of efforts to conclude a new bilateral trade framework, 
stressing the need for a "cooling off period." Hosokawa spoke 
to reporters at a press conference after a previously 
unscheduled breakfast meeting with Clinton, called at Clinton's 
request, in the family quarters of the executive mansion. 
  He said that the two sides could not resolve their 
differences regarding interpretation of a previous agreement to 
use "objective criteria" to measure the progress of imports in 
Japan. Japan rejects the idea of using "numerical targets" to 
that end, which it says amounts to managed trade. 
  But Hosokawa said he was hopeful that the U.S. would not, in 
the aftermath of the collapse of the talks, resort to 
"unilateral punitive measures in violation of GATT," a reference 
to the multilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  U.S. officials have warned of retaliation against Japan 
before the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries convenes 
its annual summit meeting in Naples in early July. 
  Hosokawa said his "frank" breakfast talks with Clinton took 
place in a "relaxed atmosphere" and that they did not dwell on 
awkward subjects. He said the talks reaffirmed the "adult" 
nature of the bilateral relationship. 
  Clinton and Hosokawa had three hours of formal summit talks 
Friday at the White House, in which the two leaders had what one 
senior U.S. administration official later described as "rather 
intense" exchanges over economic issues. 
  They announced afterwards Friday at a joint news conference 
the two countries' failure to reach an accord on the new 
framework. U.S. administration officials subsequently said 
Washington would not reopen the framework negotiations unless 
Tokyo changes its position. 
  The Clinton administration concluded an agreement with 
Hosokawa's predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa, last July that called 
for setting up a new "framework" of trade relations between the 
two countries to help slash Japan's trade surplus and open its 
markets. 
  Under the terms of the agreement, the two countries were 
supposed to work out a formula by the summit meeting Friday on 
how to increase foreign access in specific market sectors -- 
autos and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of 
telecommunications and medical equipment. 
  Hosokawa is due to return home on Sunday.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa with </F>
Japanese and foreign correspondents at the Madison Hotel in 
Washington -- live] 
  [Text] [Tachihara] I am Tachihara from the Political News 
Department of JIJI NEWS AGENCY. Prime Minister, I would like to 
ask two questions. The first concerns the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks which failed to hammer out an accord. I feel 
moves will increase in the United States to take retaliatory 
action against Japan. How will the Japanese Government respond 
to those moves? Prime Minister, you said that awhile ago you had 
breakfast with the President. Would you give the details of 
what you and the President talked about during breakfast? 
  [Hosokawa] I would like to answer your first question. As 
for U.S. sanctions against Japan, I believe and strongly hope 
that the United States will not take unilateral steps that run 
counter to the rules of the General Agreement on Tariff and 
Trade [GATT]. As I said awhile ago, I intend to make energetic 
efforts to promote negotiations in areas in which the two 
countries failed to reach an agreement following a period of 
cooling off. This morning, I had breakfast with the President. 
As I said awhile ago, the President and myself talked about the 
Cuban and Latin American situations as well as issues in the 
Asia-Pacific region. The President and myself spent much of 
time looking around the White House. The President showed me a 
room where President Lincoln signed documents as well as other 
historical rooms. 
  [Tanabe] I am Tanabe from KYODO NEWS AGENCY. Prime 
Minister, I would like to ask you two questions. My first 
concerns the Japan- U.S. economic framework talks that ended 
yesterday. The Clinton administration has persistently asked 
Japan to establish numerical targets. Prime Minister, do you 
think the Clinton administration's trade policy is tilting 
toward managed trade? During the past six months of 
negotiations, the United States has criticized the Japanese 
bureaucracy. Prime Minister, do you think the U.S. criticism is 
accurate? 
  [Hosokawa] I would like to answer your first question. As I 
said awhile ago, there has been substantial progress in 
negotiations on procedures for individual areas. However, the 
two countries failed to bridge their differences on the 
relationship between objective criteria and numerical targets, 
although they exchanged their views and asserted their 
respective positions. The issue of objective criteria is one 
aspect of the economic framework talks. My understanding is that 
it will not have a harmful impact on overall Japan-U.S. 
relations. I repeatedly told the President I cannot accept 
numerical targets which could lead to managed trade. Japanese 
negotiators have repeatedly asserted Japan cannot accept 
numerical targets. The objective criteria which the United 
States has proposed has been interpreted in various ways. I 
told the President that objective criteria and numerical targets 
are one in the same. During the talks, I also told the 
President they are incompatible with the thinking of the 
Hosokawa government, which is promoting deregulation as its 
primary policy. I told the President that for this reason I 
cannot agree with them. 
  As for your question about U.S. criticism against Japanese 
bureaucrats, it is very hard for me to answer. Foreign nations 
are liable to adopt such views. Although this question is 
related to the first, officials in various ministries and 
agencies have repeatedly maintained in the negotiations that the 
government could not commit itself to resolving issues which are 
out of the government's jurisdiction through measures like 
managed trade. However, I think foreign nations may see Japan 
as Japan Incorporated, and may have a certain prejudice against 
Japan. During the current negotiations, I made some decisions 
transcending the jurisdictions of various ministries and 
agencies after having studied what sort of measures are 
desirable for the national interests of Japan and the survival 
of Japan within the international community. 
  [Domoto] I am Domoto from NHK. I would like to ask about 
domestic affairs. You will have to tackle the Diet session 
shortly after you return to Japan. What will be your most 
important domestic agenda for the time being? Do you intend to 
manage politics without reshuffling your cabinet, at least until 
the ordinary Diet session ends? I would like you to answer 
these two questions. 
  [Hosokawa] Needless to say, the most important issue in 
domestic politics is to pass the draft budget as soon as 
possible. I intend to do the utmost to tackle this issue. This 
is the most important task for me for the time being. Moreover, 
other important bills -- such as the Product Liability Bill -- 
have been submitted to the current Diet session for 
consideration. In view of the present economic situation, the 
most urgent task is to have the draft budget pass the Diet as 
soon as possible. As for reshuffling the cabinet, I am not 
thinking of it at this moment because until now I have devoted 
myself to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, tax system reform, 
political reform, and other issues. 
  [Jim] Prime Minister, I am Jim from the LOS ANGELES TIMES. 
During your current visit to Washington, you stated the Japanese 
Government would cooperate in imposing economic sanctions 
against the DPRK over its suspected development of nuclear 
weapons under the scope of Japanese law. Do you mean Japan is 
considering economic sanctions? Could you tell us specifically 
about what Japan is preparing to do? I think whether Japan will 
stop remittances to North Korea is an issue. 
  [Hosokawa] From a viewpoint of settling the issue through 
continuous discussions, Japan will continue to work with the 
United States, the Republic of Korea, and China. If the 
international community or the United Nations decides to take 
measures against North Korea, then it is natural for Japan to 
take responsible action. I cannot predict what sort of results 
the talks between the IAEA and North Korea, which are to be held 
at the end of February, will yield. As I said awhile ago, if 
sanctions are imposed against North Korea, Japan will take 
measures based on its responsibility under the scope of its laws. 
  A question was asked on the issue of remitting money to 
North Korea. We do not know exactly how much they are sending 
to North Korea. The human rights issue is also involved in 
this. Therefore, we have to take these points into 
consideration. 
  [Doya] I am Ayako Doya from THE JAPAN TIMES. Some U.S. 
Government officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor, are of the opinion that sanctions should be imposed 
against Japan should Japan refuse to accept numerical targets. 
Others are saying we should not let the issue of numerical 
targets damage Japan-U.S. relations. Roughly speaking, they are 
divided into two groups. However, the President is the one who 
is going to decide on this matter. You have spent many hours in 
discussions with the President. Which side is the President 
leaning towards, and how much of your explanations did the 
President understand? 
  [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, I think Japan-U.S. relations 
have entered a new era. In the past, both countries mutually 
refrained from saying things which were really difficult to say. 
By surmounting each situation, they cleared hurdles one by one. 
As a result, Japan gave answers which could be interpreted in 
different manners. Japan eventually viewed U.S. attempts as 
outside pressure [gaiatsu]; through outside pressure, the United 
States tried to get a compromise from Japan. I have a feeling 
both countries have such an impression of each other. The 
United States, Canada, and Europe candidly talk about matters 
which are difficult to discuss. Earlier I called it mature 
relations. I am of the opinion that Japan-U.S. relations should 
also be that way. In this sense, I think my recent visit was a 
very good one. You asked what President Clinton thinks of 
sanctions. I feel he thinks the same way. As I earlier said, I 
do not think sanctions will be immediately imposed against Japan. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I have two questions. The 
first is this. You have said that for awhile both countries 
will have a period of cooling off. I understand reviews will be 
made twice a year. Do you have a plan to visit the United 
States before six months have passed to meet President Clinton 
again? Another question is about the comprehensive economic 
measures you recently announced. It seems the measures are ill 
spoken of by some U.S. Government officials. Can you comment on 
this? 
  [Hosokawa] As for the economic stimulus package, as you 
said the United States did not favorably evaluate it. However, 
when we look at the tax cuts specified in the package, the 
amount of the reductions is considerably larger than those which 
Japan carried out when former President Reagan was in office. 
Moreover, my cabinet has laid out plans for promoting 
discussions by the end of this year on drastic tax reform 
measures. I asked the President to understand this. I also 
stressed that major economic stimulus measures amounting to over 
15 trillion yen will certainly have a favorable effect on our 
efforts to establish and promote a domestic demand-oriented 
economy. What was your first question? 
  [Correspondent] The next visit to the United States at an 
earlier date. 
  [Hosokawa] So far I am not thinking about paying a visit to 
the United States at an earlier date. But I want to discuss the 
scheduling of the next visit with the secretariat, although I 
have no idea how long a cooling off period we need. 
  [Komori] I am Komori with SANKEI SHIMBUN. You have stressed 
several times that Japan-U.S. relations have entered the stage 
of mature relations, like relations between the United States 
and European nations. Taking a look at relations between the 
United States and European nations, I find that although they 
exchange sharp debates on economic issues, their relations are 
solid because they share a very similar basic sense of values on 
such matters as security, diplomacy, democracy, and human 
rights. So they base their disputes over economic affairs on 
their solid relations. In the case of relations between Japan 
and the United States, I wonder if Japan and the United States 
share a similar sense of values, particularly on security. Do 
you still have confidence in maintaining basic bilateral 
relations while the two countries are engaged in heated disputes 
over economic issues? 
  [Hosokawa] I think we have to let our relations enter such 
an era. Moreover, I feel such an atmosphere is being steadily 
created through a series of talks between myself and President 
Clinton -- including the summit talks yesterday as well as the 
previous summit talks -- as well as ministerial and 
working-level talks. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am with AP. As regards 
objective criteria, the U.S. Government has said it will not 
resume negotiations until Japan changes its position. In a 
meeting held in the morning, Japan said it will not change its 
position, thus showing a tough stance. If both sides establish 
a cooling off period, is there any possibility Japan would 
propose some kind of compromise, or do you think a compromise 
should be proposed by the United States? 
  [Hosokawa] On the issues of government procurement or 
insurance, for example, Japan and the United States are moving 
closer to each other, and an agreement is within their reach. 
The problem is objective criteria, and it runs counter to the 
principle of our negotiations. Japan holds its basic stand that 
one way or another it is necessary to avoid objective criteria 
that goes against our efforts in promoting deregulations and 
leads to managed trade. Japan will not change its position in 
this regard. However, as I said earlier, since finishing 
touches on negotiations on some individual trade sectors are 
being put into place, I would like to find a clue to break the 
deadlock after a cooling off period. This is what I feel now.

news conference]

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Sunday [13 February] a trade agreement between 
Japan and the United States was "80 to 90 percent complete" but 
President Bill Clinton rejected it. Hosokawa made the remark to 
reporters aboard a special government jetliner which landed at 
Haneda Airport in Tokyo at 5:50 P.M. Sunday. 
  He said his government will assemble officials of various 
government agencies either Monday or Tuesday to explore steps to 
revive the abortive trade talks with the U.S. 
  Hosokawa met Clinton in Washington for three hours Friday 
and 
attended a breakfast meeting with the President at the White 
House on Saturday. 
  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are designed to help 
correct the trade imbalance by increasing the access of foreign 
firms to Japan's markets in the auto and auto parts and 
insurance sectors and boosting foreign participation in 
government procurement of telecommunications and medical 
equipment. 
  Asked at his official residence about a report in THE 
WASHINGTON POST's Sunday issue suggesting potential U.S. trade 
sanctions against Japan, Hosokawa said, "it's too early" to 
speculate on U.S. action.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Hosokawa, who visited the United 
States for the Japan-U.S. summit talks, returned home this 
evening. Regarding the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
which ended in failure, he indicated an intention to take quick 
action to study possible measures to promote market opening 
with the aim of reducing Japan's trade surplus and work out own 
plans. 
  After finishing his summit talks with U.S. President Clinton 
in Washington, Prime Minister Hosokawa arrived at the Haneda 
Airport around 1800 [0900 GMT] today. 
  From tomorrow, he will be busy dealing with immediate tasks, 
such as the final compilation of the government's budget plan 
for fiscal 1994 which will be decided on 15 February, Diet 
deliberations on the fiscal budget, and reviewing problems of 
the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which remain deadlocked. 
  As for the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa, speaking with reporters, said: Since a trade 
agreement was 80 to 90 percent complete, I asked the President 
at the summit talks to conclude the talks. But President 
Clinton proposed not to conclude the talks in that way. 
  Asked how to deal with the results of the talks, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa said: Immediately after returning home, we 
will review the problems. We have to use our brains, and Japan 
will carry out what it can do. In this way, he said the 
government will start studying possible measures to promote 
market opening which will help reduce Japan's trade surplus. 
  Touching on his diplomatic schedule, Prime Minister Hosokawa 
disclosed that it is difficult to materialize his scheduled 
visit to China in March. He expressed his hope to visit foreign 
nations during the consecutive holidays in May. He then said 
that European nations and Vietnam are potential countries to 
visit.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion as part of political magazine program </F>
`News 2001' with Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international 
trade and industry (MITI), Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi of Keio 
University, columnist Minoru Omori, and commentator Kenichi 
Takemura attending, moderated by newscasters Yuri Kuroiwa and 
Kaori Matsuyama] 
  [Excerpts] [Kuroiwa] In describing the [Washington] 
summit meeting, people are using the expression failure, but it 
could be a start of mature relationship. What is your frank 
view of this? 
  [Kumagai] I feel exactly the same way. I would prefer to 
use the expression damage control rather than failure. As the 
President says, let's cool our head down, and then take up the 
issues once again. This attitude was clearly revealed in the 
joint news conference of the two top leaders. The talks started 
last July. There were problems from the beginning, and it can be 
said those problems surfaced prominently only recently. But I 
am relieved very much to see from the joint news conference that 
there is a common recognition that bilteral relations between 
Japan and the United States are one of the most important of 
bilteral relations. 
  While the economy is a very important matter, and even 
though 
there remain unresolved issues between the two countries, there 
is a common recognition that these issues must be resolved. If 
I may compare it to mountain climbing, the two countries agree 
which mountain top to climb, but disagree on which routes to 
take. As long as both countries can discuss and agree on which 
route to take, I do not think Japan-U.S. relations will rupture. 
  There may be some minor tremors. Basically, I can see the 
strong relations of trust between the top leaders of the 
countries. As such, I think we need not be worried even though 
there are problems. 
  [Kobayashi] Regarding the setting of numerical targets -- 
for example, in use of U.S.-made semiconductors -- do you as the 
minister of international trade and industry think this is a 
sort of managed trade and is against the spirit of the GATT? 
  [Kumagai] I would like to set the issue of semiconductors 
aside. There is a long history to it. But doing something like 
that in other areas is unacceptable. We cannot accept it. That 
is going completely contrary to the direction aimed at by the 
Hosokawa government. That is going against the basic thinking 
of deciding things based on the functioning of open markets. I 
think we can never accept it -- even in the future. [passage on 
Omori's comment omitted] 
  [Kuroiwa] Mr. Omori says the U.S. Congress may agree on 
taking retaliatory actions against Japan. Minister Kumagai, how 
do you intend to respond to that? 
  [Kumagai] It will not come just from the U.S. Congress, but 
also from the administration. Naturally, it is possible to 
think that they will do something with the exchange rate or make 
verbal threats. The U.S. Congress in particular has been very 
aggressive in this regard. That is why I used the expression 
damage control. What is important is that whether it be the 
exchange rate or reinstituting the 301 provisions, I think there 
are ways to respond to them. In the case of the exchange rate, 
I think there are limits to what it can do. Eventually, the 
rate will come to change by the logic of the market. There is 
no doubt that the Japan's surplus has peaked and is coming down. 
The rate might fluctuate for the time being, but I think we can 
cope with it in a calm manner. 
  As regards the 301 provisions, I think we can take care of 
them in the multilateral arena of negotiations. What is 
important is for Japan to not act emotionally as they do. What 
is most important is for Japan to open an arena of talks and to 
resume negotiations soon -- since it is true that there is the 
trade gap between the two countries and we have this problem of 
the gap needing to be narrowed and removed. 
  [Kuroiwa] If the retaliations come to be enforced in fact, 
will you appeal this to the GATT? 
  [Kumagai] Of course, I will if the retaliations have no 
legal grounds. For instance, if they abolish taxes on parts or 
if the 301 provisions are reinstituted, I think we can act 
against it based on pertinent rules. [passage on Takeuchi's and 
Omori's comments omitted] 
  [Matsuyama] Mr. Kumagai, the United States is saying it will 
decide on retaliation before the Napoli summit in July. That 
means Japan will have to do something before July? [Kumagai] 
Yes, in fact way before that. In areas other than numerical 
targets, the talks were making smooth very progress -- with 
respect to procedures, deregulation, and so forth. Hence, if 
the issue of numerical targets is resolved in a way that those 
things are not necessary... [changes thought] We need to recall 
why the issue of the numerical targets was raised to begin with. 
There was the following line of thinking: If regulations are 
eased and trade is allowed to be conducted in a freer manner, 
things normally improve automatically, but in the case of Japan, 
it is not going well. Hence, the most effective way to deal 
with Japan is to assign numbers -- shares or growth rates -- to 
it. This is the rationale given by those who say Japan is 
different from other countries. 
  It is important to deal with this problem of the U.S. 
mistrust in Japan. For instance, to take negotiations on the 
construction market, there is an agreement on the score report 
system under which when there is no improvement over the past, 
both parties will get together and think up new ways of making 
improvement possible. Under the agreement, what the governments 
will do and what the private sectors should do are 
distinguished. In this manner, much progress has already been 
made in this area. 
  I think the same degree of result can be achieved in other 
areas. Right now the United States is distrustful of Japan. If 
Japan can present leads that can remove this mistrust, I am sure 
we can bring the talks to a conclusion. 
  Mr. Omori gave a pessimistic view. But as far as we -- the 
people at the front of the negotiations -- are concerned, we 
feel we were only a short way away from the goal. 
  [Kuroiwa] Mr. Omori mentioned the possibility of the United 
States inciting yen value to rise in the exchange market. Do 
you see that possibility? 
  [Kumagai] To talk about inciting the yen rate, it is 
unthinkable that they would intervene in the market and pump in 
a huge amount of money. In other words, inciting will come 
verbally. Oral intervention is effective when the market is 
already flowing toward that way. But Japan's surplus is heading 
for the direction of being eased, and it is losing its 
competitiveness very fast. Changes are taking place in Japan. 
Supermarkets want to buy cheap foreign products, and the 
Japanese consumers have become price- conscious, too. They are 
no longer sticklers for Japanese products. When taking these 
conditions into account, I think it is possible that the high 
yen will impact the Japanese economy, as Mr. Omori has said, but 
it will be for a short while and will not last long. That is 
what I think. [passage omitted on Omori's comment on U.S. 
mistrust of Japanese bureaucrats] 
  [Kuroiwa] Mr. Kumagai, what is your view on the question of 
U.S. mistrust of Japanese bureaucrats? 
  [Kumagai] They are very emotional. That is why such 
criticism is fired against us. To take the auto issue for 
instance, Japan's purchases of auto parts from the United States 
have grown drastically. But they do not want to confirm this 
fact. I am sure the auto part companies and auto manufacturers 
of the United States are aware of this very well. I feel the 
warriors of Washington are firing verbal barrages at us without 
confirming this. After all, we are talking about economic 
negotiations. Judgments should be based, based on given facts. 
What is important is that we are not saying that existing 
conditions are desirable. Japan must make it clear it will take 
concrete actions to resolve this trade surplus issue. But there 
are things that cannot be done, and about those things we have 
no choice but to abide by our stand. [passage omitted on 
Kobayashi's comments on Japan's problems] 
  [Kumagai] We explained to them about plans on deregulation 
to liberalize and open up the market further and progress has 
been made in the negotiations. After hearing what Mr. Omori 
said to me a little while ago, I feel I must make clear to the 
people of the United States one point -- that framework talks 
are not an arena of negotiations where only Japan talks but both 
countries do talk. If sales of autos or medical supplies to 
Japan are to be raised, both countries must make efforts. To 
take autos for instance, Neon is said to be a very good car with 
steering wheels on right hand side. But that car is not coming 
to Japan. They don't want to sell it in Japan until two years 
pass. I would like to say sales can be made only with both 
sides agreeing. 
  The summit meeting ended only just now. Verbal barrages may 
not be inevitable for now. But both countries' economy is 
dependent on each other. Where economy is concerned, Japan is 
not a country that can be ignored by the United States -- more 
so if the political and security issues are added to it. So is 
the United States to Japan. I think we need to think coolly and 
calmly in this respect. [passage omitted on comments by Takemura 
and writer Susume Nishibe] 
  [Kuroiwa] Minister Kumagai, what is most important to make 
the Japan-U.S. relationship the real adults' relationship? 
  [Kumagai] That is to make clear Japan's resolve to redress 
the problem of the conspicuous current-account surplus. The way 
of doing is to depart from the past bureaucratic ways and to do 
it through basic reforming of economy. To see from statistical 
numbers, the current-account surplus ran to 3.8 percent of the 
gross domestic product at the peak point. Germany's record 
topped 4.0 percent once, and at that time it came under heavy 
attack from all over the world. At present, that percentage for 
Japan has come to below 3 percent. It will go down to 2.8 
percent next year, and will go on down further. I am sure the 
problem is being resolved. It is not desirable to get excited 
[words indistinct]. The Hosokawa government should return to 
the starting point, and should become a government which is 
friendly to the world -- by carrying out economic, 
administrative, and political reforms.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion as part of the "Toron" program with </F>
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura; Nobuyuki Sekiyama of 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan; Kozo Watanabe of 
Shinseito, Japan Renewal Party; Hiroyuki Sonoda of Sakigake, 
Harbinger; Masajuro Shiokawa of the Liberal Democratic Party, 
LDP; Kabun Muto of the LDP; and Hiroshi Kikunami of the Japan 
Communist Party; moderated by NHK commentators Takashi Yamamoto 
and Takanobu Fujita] 
  [Excerpts] [Yamamoto] The Japan-U.S. summit talks ended 
with an unusual result of a breakup between the two leaders. I 
would like to address my first question to the chief cabinet 
secretary on the government's future course of action. Mr. 
Takemura, the summit could not work out even a joint communique. 
What is your comment on the summit results? 
  [Takemura] It is true that the result was unusual compared 
with those of Japan-U.S. negotiations in the past. While the 
result is called a breakup or a failure, the two leaders 
sincerely discussed Asian affairs and the North Korean 
situation. Also in the framework talks, the two leaders reached 
accord on such global topics as population, AIDS, and 
environment issues. To be exact, the two nations did not reach 
accord in four fields -- government procurement, insurance, 
auto, and auto parts. When the prime minister left for 
Washington, we confirmed with him that Japan could not accept 
the numerical targets, and he told us that he would do his best 
on that point. As a result, the United States did not give this 
up too, and, as you know, the summit ended like that. In a way, 
this was the first time Japan maintained its consistency at the 
talks with the United States. But I do not think all Japan has 
to do is to say no to the U.S. demand. This is because both 
Japan and the United States are responsible for results of 
saying no to each other. While it is impossible for Japan to 
accept the numerical targets, it is still responsible for 
redressing its huge trade surplus through liberalizing and 
expanding its own markets. From the standpoint that bilateral 
relations with the United States are very important, Japan 
should exert sincere efforts on the basis of the summit results. 
  [Yamamoto] As you noted, the numerical target issue had been 
a clear point of contention between the two nations. Did you 
expect such results in advance? 
  [Takemura] Well, Japan has sincerely been explaining its 
position to the United States. Unfortunately, however, we could 
not agree on that point. In the past, the two nations have 
reached many bilateral agreements, including the semiconductor 
accord, and we thought we can work out a similar concession 
plan. Yet, Japan and the United States are nations of market 
economy and enjoy the free market system. So, it seems wrong 
for the government to set up detailed target figures for the 
private sector and exercise public control over the market. 
Since the Hosokawa administration is currently pursuing the 
deregulation policy to further liberalize the market, we had to 
refuse the U.S. proposal at any rate. [passage omitted on 
Yamamoto's question to Muto on how he conducted negotiations 
with the United States when he was the minister of international 
trade and industry and Muto's response] 
  [Yamamoto] While you said Japan had to refuse the U.S. 
proposal, the U.S. Congress has already begun to demand economic 
sanctions against Japan in response to the failure in the 
summit. What do you think about it? 
  [Takemura] I have heard that possibilities of economic 
sanctions were not discussed at talks between the prime minister 
and Mr. Clinton. But I think it is natural that some quarters 
in the Congress and public of the United States would show such 
reactions. But the two nations are in accord on the point that 
they have to maintain the important relations. I hope the 
United States takes prudent and reasonable attitude, and stays 
away from unilateral measures. 
  [Yamamoto] Please excuse me for asking a hypothetical 
question. What would the government do if the United States 
imposes economic sanctions against Japan over the economic talks? 
  [Takemura] We hope that will not happen. It is hard to 
answer questions based on supposition, but, during the Uruguay 
Round last year, GATT decided to provide some sort of mechanism 
to handle international trade disputes. I think that is a 
possible way Japan may take. 
  [Fujita] Mr. Chief Cabinet Secretary, don't you think the 
breakup will have some negative impact on the friendly 
relationship between Japan and the United States? It seems to 
me that the United States has some sort of distrust of Japan and 
thinks that it is not making progress in liberalizing market 
even after discussions. What do you think of this point? 
  [Takemura] I do not think Japan's demands on the numerical 
targets were wrong. To the United States, the huge amount of 
deficit, which amounts to over $130 billion, in trade with Japan 
is continuing to grow. Actually, it is gradually decreasing. 
However, the United States thinks that Japan is not making 
concrete efforts to reduce this deficit although more than 30 
accords have been signed. Mr. Clinton is also feeling that no 
progress has been made at all. It seems that he has a strong 
distrust of Japan because the outcome of Japan's efforts in 
liberalizing its market and expanding its domestic demands to 
the expectation of the United States are still invisible. We 
have to understand this point. Deregulation, which will be 
linked to import promotion, is also an important issue to the 
Hosokawa administration. At the same time, we also need to 
narrow the price differences at home and abroad. Also, we have 
to voluntarily do our best to expand the market access no matter 
whether the United States calls for it or not. By doing that, 
we need to make the United States understand that Japan is 
seriously thinking about these matters as a whole. 
  [Fujita] Looking back at the past, I think it was a mistake 
that we agreed last July to set up objective criteria. That was 
the beginning of the failure. Don't you think we should have 
clarified what the objective criteria were at least? 
  [Takemura] Some people may think that way. However, we have 
had a long debate over the issue of what we meant by objective 
criteria. Objective criteria can be based on the figures for 
the past or figures for future targets. During the debate, we 
mixed up these figures and were unable to understand each other. 
  [Yamamoto] As for the future, both countries agreed to 
resume the economic talks after cooling off their heads for a 
while. When do you think the economic talks will resume? 
  [Takemura] We do not have a concrete plan as yet. The 
government will discuss this issue after the prime minister and 
the foreign minister return. Roughly speaking, however, the 
talks will be held for two years at the rate of twice a year. 
We already had an interim meeting this year. It is possible 
that we may have the second meeting, which will be held when the 
next G-7 summit opens in Naples in July, to discuss this issue. 
There are about five months between now and then. During this 
period, we will cool off our heads. There is no point in merely 
thinking about it without any actions. Therefore, I think we 
have to take due actions. 
  [Yamamoto] Prime Minister Hosokawa called the Japan-U.S. 
relations a mature adult relationship. However, what do you 
think the Japan-U.S. relations will be like in the future? 
  [Takemura] As the prime minister said, I think the 
Japan-U.S. relations will enter into a mature adult 
relationship, too. However, it is not an easy matter. Japan 
will be expected to demonstrate its independence in the 
diplomatic world. It will be entering a severe diplomatic 
stage. We have to promote true Japanese diplomacy or diplomacy 
in which we can maintain our independence. 
  [Yamamoto] Indeed, some people are already pointing out that 
it is a bit too optimistic to think that we established a mature 
adult relationship. We should expect to see a very severe 
situation. What do you think? 
  [Takemura] We need to see things in terms of overall 
politics and take the security issue into consideration. It 
would be nice if we have a mature adult relationship in every 
respect. We need to say things we want to say while having 
mutual understanding of each other's position. We just cannot 
have a reasonable argument on the basis of a race feeling 
[minzoku kanjo] or national awareness. 
  [Yamamoto] Earlier, we talked about the possibility that the 
United States may impose sanctions against Japan. Some people 
are worried that the Japan-U.S. relations may become very tense 
and suffer setbacks. 
  [Takemura] I do not think so. We should absolutely not 
allow these things to take place. To Japan, the United States 
is the most important country in every respect. Japan's 
fundamental diplomacy in the postwar era has been to maintain 
good relations with the United States. All political parties in 
Japan accept that. We should never change this fundamental 
diplomacy. 
  [Fujita] Do you think the Japan-U.S. negotiations will be 
resumed in the same style as the current framework talks? Or, 
do you think completely new framework talks will start? 
  [Takemura] This matter was left as a pending issue. Even 
though we are going to have a cooling-off period, I think both 
sides have to take some kind of actions at certain point. 
  [Yamamoto] Mr. Chief Cabinet Secretary, we have to stop our 
discussion here because it is time for you to go to another 
place. Thank you very much for being with us. 
  [Takemura] Thank you very much. [passage omitted on 
discussion by other participants about scrapped government 
proposal for consumption tax hike, ideal tax system, and 
introduction of welfare tax]

  [Text] Tokyo, feb. 13 KYODO -- Japan's major dailies 
urged Japan and the United States Sunday to find a breakthrough 
in the collapsed bilateral trade negotiations by making the best 
use of a cooling off period. 
  The ASAHI SHIMBUN said, "If the world's two economic 
superpowers...retaliate against each other by taking protective 
trade steps, damage to the global economy would be great," and 
urged the two countries to handle the situation with a long-term 
perspective. Commenting on Friday's summit talks between 
Japanese prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton in Washington over bilateral framework trade talks, 
the leading daily said, "the summit sessions made people feel 
Japan-U.S. relations entered into a new stage." 
  Hosokawa and Clinton could not reach an accord on the 
framework talks to slash Japan's trade surplus and open its 
markets. "In many of the previous Japan-U.S. summit talks, the 
Japanese side gave in considerably to (U.S. demands) to keep the 
alliance, thus causing anti-U.S. feelings to spread in Japan, 
and coating the surface with vague agreements, leaving seeds of 
dispute." 
  "Hosokawa and Clinton frankly said `no' to each other on the 
economic issues and (such a way) is better than the practice in 
previous summit talks, in which success was an imperative goal," 
the ASAHI said in its editorial. In order to make use of the 
establishment of "a mature adult relationship," the daily, 
however, urged the two countries not to let economic 
confrontation spill over into overall bilateral ties, and it 
asked Japan to act on opening its markets and reducing the trade 
surplus. 
  The MAINICHI SHIMBUN also urged the two countries to set up 
a 
cooling off period and probe a strategy for mutual prosperity 
and existence, saying, "the development of the U.S. economy 
hinges on the extent it takes hold in Asia and (for that reason) 
cooperation between Japan and the U.S. is indispensable." 
  The daily said, "the bickering between Japanese and U.S. 
Administrations did not reflect the competence of or cooperation 
among private sectors." 
  Noting views that the U.S. electronics and auto industries 
have regained competitive strength with the improved U.S. 
economy, that Japan is no longer a threat to the U.S. economy, 
and that Japan's current account surplus is shrinking sharply, 
the daily said "(we) should not react excessively to the 
disagreement (on the trade negotiations)." There are many 
factors that time would solve even if (the two countries) do not 
do anything," it said. 
  The largest circulation daily the YOMIURI SHIMBUN said, "we 
believe the summit meeting reflected a post-Cold War 
relationship between Japan and the United States that is 
reaching a new, mature stage." 
  The daily expressed hope that both Japan and the U.S. would 
resume talks by making good use of a cooling off period, saying, 
"the maintenance of positive bilateral relations between Japan 
and the United States is important for the security of Asia as 
well as the rest of the world." 
  "As Japan-U.S. relations mature, both nations must fulfill 
their responsibilities as mature nations. In this respect, 
Japan must implement what it can do as quickly as it can," the 
YOMIURI said. "Above all, Japan must deregulate its economy and 
improve government procurement, which the government can do on 
its own," the daily added. 
  The daily also urged Japan to pursue the further realization 
of opening its markets by getting the stagnating economy on 
track through stimulating domestic demand with flexible fiscal 
and financial measures, as well as more strictly applying the 
antimonopoly law. It asked the U.S. to reconsider ways to 
promote foreign access to Japanese markets, saying "we can never 
agree with the idea of setting unilateral numerical targets and 
threatening to impose trade sanctions against Japan." 
  The leading economic daily NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said, "Japan 
and the U.S. are in a state of economic war in the wake of the 
breakdown of the framework trade talks." Expressing concern 
that emotional confrontation could spread between the two 
countries, the daily said, "it is important that Japan and the 
U.S. try to strengthen bilateral relations by all means." 
  "Numerical targets demanded by the U.S. would surely lead to 
managed trade...but the Japanese side also made a mistake by 
saying only `no' to the matter and did not act on opening 
markets, delaying pump-priming measures," it said. 
  "The biggest mistake was that both Japan and the U.S. faced 
off without taking into account the chaotic post-Cold War 
world," the NIHON KEIZAI said.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 13 KYODO -- A Japanese business 
leader cautioned the United States against hasty retaliatory 
action against Japan following the breakdown of trade talks, 
saying it would worsen bilateral relations. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), also said in Washington that it was 
wrong to begin the talks that collapsed Friday [11 February] 
while leaving the definition of "numerical targets" vague. The 
U.S. had sought such targets as a way of gauging progress in 
import penetration into the Japanese market. 
  Hiraiwa was speaking at a reception for Japanese and U.S. 
business leaders held in preparation for a conference between 
them slated for this summer in Tokyo. 
  Some 30 business leaders from the two countries attended the 
reception, with the Japanese side led by Yotaro Kobayashi, 
chairman of the Japan-U.S. Economic Council, and the U.S. side 
by Joseph Gorman, chairman of the U.S.-Japan Economic Council. 
Kobayashi is chairman of Fuji Xerox Co. and Gorman of the 
Ohio-based high- technology firm TRW Inc. 
  The councils are to hold a joint meeting starting Monday to 
discuss political and economic issues, including the chronic 
trade imbalance between the two countries. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor is scheduled to give 
a speech at the meeting.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa vowed Monday [14 February] that Japan will make 
voluntary efforts to reduce its trade surplus with the United 
States before the summit meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) 
major industrial countries in Naples in July. 
  Hosokawa made the remarks at a meeting of government and 
ruling coalition parties after he and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton failed during a summit meeting in Washington on Friday 
to reach on accord on a new trade framework, officials said. 
  Hosokawa was quoted as saying it is "not favorable" for 
Japan's 50 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. to 
continue and the situation "must be improved." He said it is 
imperative for both the private sector and the government to 
make appropriate efforts.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 14 KYODO -- The U.S. Government 
Monday [14 February] unleashed a sharp attack on Japan's trade 
policy, accusing the Japanese of maintaining subtle and covert 
market barriers against imports. The White House, in an annual 
report on the nation's economy, said the United States has 
sought "objective criteria" to measure Japan's imports because 
the Japanese trade structure differs from other industrial 
nations. 
  "Japan is an outlier [as received]," top White House 
economist Laura Tyson said in a briefing to reporters on the 
presidential economic report. The report said Japan does not 
keep foreign products out through tariffs and import quotas, 
which "are not significant trade barriers." 
  The obstacles which foreign businesses must face in Japan, 
it 
said, are more subtle and therefore more difficult to penetrate, 
particularly in the manufacturing sector. "Japan's market is 
regarded by many as effectively closed to imports of many 
foreign manufactures, especially those that directly compete 
with Japanese goods," the report said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Japan will take the 
initiative in opening up its markets and reduce its huge surplus 
with the United States in the wake of collapsed bilateral trade 
framework talks, a top Foreign Ministry official said Monday [14 
February]. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference 
Japan will do what it should do, whether or not there are any 
agreements with the United States. He said Japan will notify 
the U.S. Government and other countries once it makes specific 
decisions and that the Japanese Government will consider 
specific measures after consulting with relative ministries and 
agencies. 
  He pointed out that Japan has already hammered out an action 
program and it will take measures in line with that. 
  Describing the summit talks between Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton as "meaningful" in that 
they were able to discuss items of common interest, Saito said 
it was regrettable that the two countries failed to reach an 
accord in the microeconomic field of the trade framework talks. 
But he said it was impossible for Japan to accept U.S. demands 
in the framework talks since Washington did not change its 
stance of urging the introduction of numerical targets to 
measure foreign access to Japan's markets. 
  Japan is opposed to the setting of numerical targets 
claiming 
it would lead to managed trade. 
  The two governments were expected to draw up a progress 
report on the framework negotiations by Friday when Hosokawa and 
Clinton met in Washington. But they remained at loggerheads 
over the interpretation of the application of "objective 
criteria."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- The government plans to 
formulate measures designed to trim Japan's unabated external 
trade surplus and open the country's markets in the wake of the 
breakdown of the Japan-U.S. "framework" trade talks. 
  Nobuo Ishihara, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told a press 
conference that working-level officials may hold an emergency 
meeting on the collapsed trade talks Tuesday [15 February] to 
prepare for a similar meeting among Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and key cabinet members possibly later in the week. 
  The framework trade talks, aimed at redressing the bilateral 
trade imbalance, broke down last weekend over a U.S. proposal 
that "objective criteria" like numerical targets be set to gauge 
Japan's efforts to open its market to foreign goods and services. 
  Government sources said Hosokawa appears unwilling to 
hastily 
restart the framework talks. Rather, they said, the premier 
wants to fashion a sort of new action program to present to the 
U.S. in a bid to break the ice on the bilateral negotiations. 
  At a meeting earlier in the day of government and ruling 
coalition parties, Hosokawa vowed that Japan would make 
voluntary efforts to bring down its trade surplus with the U.S. 
before the summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major economic 
powers in Naples in July. 
  The sources said the forthcoming government meeting on the 
collapsed framework talks will study such measures as further 
deregulations to help correct the wide gap between domestic and 
overseas prices and boost imports, and more voluntary efforts by 
the private sector to open the market. 
  Asked what Japan will do about bilateral trade with the 
U.S., 
Trade Minister Hiroshi Kumagai also said earlier in the day that 
the government will consider "whatever macro and microeconomic 
steps Japan should take."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Monday [14 February] that the best way to resolve 
issues surrounding North Korea's suspected development of a 
nuclear weapons arsenal is through dialogue. In a meeting with 
the leaders of the government and ruling coalition parties, 
Hosokawa said, "Japan considers the best plan is through 
dialogue, no matter what the situation is." 
  In Washington over the weekend, however, the prime minister 
told reporters that Japan will take all possible measures to the 
extent of Japanese law if the United Nations Security Council 
proposes sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  Meanwhile, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social 
Democratic Party, told reporters Monday that imposing sanctions 
against North Korea would be counterproductive. 
  Kubo proposed that a resolution be sought through the 
friendly connections between the North Korean Workers' Party and 
the Chinese Communist Party. He stressed further that there is 
no way of knowing what kind of ill effects sanctions would have 
on both North Korea and Japan. 
  "Even though negotiations for establishing diplomatic 
relations between Japan and North Korea have broken down, 
efforts to improve relations would open the path" to resolving 
the nuclear issue, Kubo said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam on Monday [14 
February] agreed on the importance of tripartite cooperation 
with the United States in getting North Korea to accept 
inspections of its nuclear sites, Japanese Government officials 
said. 
  Earlier, Hosokawa had told leaders in his ruling coalition 
government that Japan considered dialogue the best means of 
resolving suspicions that Pyongyang may be attempting to build a 
nuclear arsenal. 
  Hosokawa, following a meeting with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton over the weekend, had indicated that Japan was ready to 
support the United Nations Security Council if it decides to 
impose sanctions on Pyongyang. 
  On Monday, Hosokawa spoke with Kim by telephone and both 
leaders agreed that cooperation with the U.S. will be essential 
to getting Pyongyang to accept inspections of its nuclear sites 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the officials said. 
  With the IAEA board of governors set to meet February 21, 
the 
U.S. has indicated a willingness to take Pyongyang's refusal to 
allow the checks to the Security Council and press for sanctions. 
  Japan and South Korea, which fear that sanctions might 
further heighten tension on the Korean peninsula and eventual 
disruptions in east Asia, have been seeking a negotiated 
settlement to the inspections impasse. 
  Pyongyang maintains that its nuclear facilities are for 
peaceful purposes only, but has refused for more than a year to 
grant IAEA inspectors access to sites believed to be nuclear 
waste storage facilities. 
  During the meeting earlier in the day with the leaders of 
the 
government and ruling coalition parties, Hosokawa said, "Japan 
considers the best plan is through dialogue, no matter what the 
situation is. 
  In Washington over the weekend, however, the prime minister 
told reporters that Japan will take all possible measures to the 
extent of Japanese law if the Security Council proposes 
sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  Meanwhile, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest among the seven ruling 
parties, told reporters Monday that imposing sanctions against 
North Korea would be counterproductive. 
  Kubo proposed that a resolution be sought through the 
friendly connections between the (North) Korean Workers' Party 
and the Chinese Communist Party. He said further that there is 
no way of knowing what kind of ill effects sanctions would have 
on both North Korea and Japan. 
  "Even though negotiations for establishing diplomatic 
relations between Japan and North Korea have broken down, 
efforts to improve relations would open the path" to resolving 
the nuclear issue, Kubo said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- A senior trade ministry 
official apologized Monday [14 February] for a 
"misunderstanding" caused by an internal ministry document 
advising outside bodies how to respond to reporters' questions 
about the government's new economic package. 
  Hideaki Kumano, vice minister at the International Trade and 
Industry Ministry (MITI), was commenting on a newspaper report 
that the document told major economic organizations to give a 
good evaluation of the 15.25 trillion yen package announced 
February 8. Some phrases in the document were "inappropriate," 
Kumano told a regular press conference. 
  But he added that the document, prepared for the ministry's 
internal use for what he termed "clarification," was not 
intended for distribution to outside organizations. 
  The TOKYO SHIMBUN, a major daily, said Monday that MITI had 
shown the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), the 
Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and other economic organs 
a list of model answers to give when asked for comments by 
reporters on tax reforms and other steps contained in the 
package. Most of the economic organizations rejected the 
instructions as "opinion making by bureaucrats," the newspaper 
said. 
  Kumano said MITI had no intention of putting any pressure on 
the economic community and will take every step to ensure that a 
similar misunderstanding does not take place in the future. 
  Kumano expressed concern over the yen's sharp upswing 
against 
the dollar following Friday's collapse of the trade framework 
talks between Japan and the United States. 
  Corporate earnings may turn worse again at a time when 
inventory adjustment has been progressing smoothly and overall 
business sentiment had picked up thanks to the record 15.25 
trillion pump- priming package launched February 8, he said. 
  The failure to reach agreement in the summit between Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton served to 
put "a chill blanket" on the exchange market and other sectors 
of the economy, Kumano said. He cited the need for both 
countries to make efforts to mend their soured economic ties by 
returning to the "starting point" of the current framework talks. 
  He was referring to an accord reached last July between 
Clinton and then-Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. 
  The "objective criteria" spelled out in the accord do not 
call for either country to make any promise in "future matters," 
Kumano said, repeating Japan's opposition to setting numerical 
targets to measure progress in import penetration. 
  The ongoing Japan-U.S. wrangling over the definition of 
objective criteria could be settled if they read the accord 
"carefully," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- The yen's sharp rise on 
foreign exchange markets stems from Japan's current account 
surplus, and Japan may have to tolerate it, a government source 
said Monday [14 February]. 
  The yen shot up by over 2 yen against the U.S. dollar in 
early Tokyo interbank trading Monday in reaction to the failure 
of talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President 
Bill Clinton on Friday to resolve a trade dispute. 
  The source said on condition of anonymity, "Foreign exchange 
rates reflect the balance of current account of a country. 
Japan, with this much surplus, may have to bear the yen's 
advance."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Monday [14 February] there were "somewhat speculative 
movements" involved in the day's sudden surge in the yen against 
the U.S. dollar. 
  Fujii repeatedly told a regular press conference that there 
appeared to be speculative elements in currency trading, but he 
declined to tie the surge to any cause. He said Tokyo would 
take "appropriate measures at the right time" but refused to be 
specific. 
  The Japanese currency soared 2.56 yen in Tokyo trading to 
105.69 yen to the dollar, with dealers citing the failure of 
Japan-U.S. trade talks at last Friday's summit in Washington. 
  Market players have said failure by the two countries to 
pare 
Japan's huge trade surplus would invite high-yen pressure from 
Washington, and U.S. officials were quoted by the Japanese press 
as saying a higher yen would not be surprising. But Fujii said, 
"I would like to avoid comment" on causes of the yen's rise. 
  He said it is the "common understanding" of seven leading 
industrial nations that exchange rates should move in a stable 
manner, reflecting economic fundamentals. 
  Asked about Japan-U.S. trade relations, Fujii defended 
Tokyo's macro- and microeconomic efforts, saying 
"misunderstandings remain" on the U.S. side. 
  On the insurance sector, which is under his ministry's 
jurisdiction, Fujii refuted charges that Japan is dragging its 
feet, saying the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
is making every effort to "solemnly" deregulate its insurance 
market. 
  Separately, a senior ministry official said the two sides 
had 
nearly agreed on the insurance sector before Friday's meeting of 
Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton, remaining hung up on how to 
define "objective criteria" to gauge progress. 
  Japan remains opposed to U.S. calls for what he said were 
essentially numerical targets of market share, which is decided 
by private business decisions, not government fiat, he said. 
Deregulation is the key to improving market access in 
insurance, and measuring market share is unrelated to progress 
on deregulation, the official said. 
  Despite U.S. warnings that it may review the bilateral trade 
"framework," the official said a July deadline for the talks has 
not changed and that Japan will proceed with its insurance 
deregulation. 
  Fujii said Japan's politically divisive tax cut, decided 
last 
week, has also been misunderstood. 
  Although the nearly 6 trillion yen worth of income and 
residential tax cuts were proposed for one year only, they are 
not single-year rebates, Fujii said, stressing that they 
comprise reduced rates of application. 
  The tax cuts are "the first step in a full-fledged tax 
reform" promised by the governing coalition, he said. 
  Fujii also defended the strict curbs in growth of spending 
on 
the military and for official development assistance (ODA), 
agreed Monday for inclusion Tuesday in the government's draft of 
the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  The final adjustments reflect the accumulated individual 
policy needs of each ministry or agency, Fujii said. 
  As all the government's cabinet ministers visited the 
Finance 
Ministry in turn for final budget talks with Fujii, attention 
focused on the record low 4.8 percent ODA rise from the initial 
fiscal 1993 budget and the 34-year low 0.9 percent increase for 
the Defense Agency.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- The dollar-yen rate is 
moving on "speculative dealings," and this is "undesirable," a 
top Finance Ministry official said Monday [14 February]. The 
official, requesting anonymity, said he "favors exchange rates 
that reflect economic fundamentals." 
  The dollar fell more than 2 yen to sink below 106 yen in 
Tokyo after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton failed to reach an agreement on the framework trade 
talks at their weekend meeting in Washington. 
  Rejecting possibilities of an overall review of the trade 
talks, the official said both sides decided on "a cooling-off 
period" but "the July deadline is unchanged." 
  Aside from the issue of "objective criteria" which lead to 
the failure of the summit, the official said the insurance field 
was "near agreement," and stressed that Japan would continue 
promoting deregulatory steps and other measures.

February remarks on SANKEI report on possible cabinet reshuffle; 
from "NHK News" program] 
  [Text] This morning, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told 
reporters he would finalize his stance toward a cabinet 
reshuffle after the Diet approval of the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  In the conversation with reporters, Prime Minister Hosokawa 
denied a press report that he may reshuffle the cabinet as early 
as 15 February. When asked about the possibility of a cabinet 
reshuffle after the enactment of the 1994 budget, he said he has 
no idea unless the budget is approved. 
  In a 12 February news conference in Washington, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa said he intends to devote himself to the Diet 
deliberations on the budget for the time being; the reshuffle of 
the cabinet is not on the agenda. It is believed he meant he 
would determine if he would reshuffle the cabinet after the Diet 
approval of the 1994 budget. 
  In connection with this, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura said in a news conference this morning that the prime 
minister has the authority to determine when to reshuffle the 
cabinet. Then, he stated as follows: 
  [Begin Takemura recording] In my understanding, I did not 
feel it was the intention of the prime minister when I met with 
him yesterday and today. I guess the prime minister currently 
has no plan for a cabinet reshuffle, as he said at yesterday's 
news conference. [end recording]

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Shinseito co-leader Ichiro 
Ozawa wants ruling coalition parties to merge into a new party 
to be led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to win in the next 
general election for the House of Representatives, the 
mass-circulation daily YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported Monday [14 
February]. 
  Ozawa, a powerful figure in the coalition government, said 
in 
an interview with the paper that the "(ruling parties) have no 
choice but to compete in (the next lower house) election as a 
single party." He was quoted as saying that such a merger is 
necessary to win against the primary opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) in the next lower house polls to be held 
under a new electoral system, which combines single-seat 
constituencies and proportional representation seats. 
  Ozawa said the ruling parties will not form a government 
with 
the LDP after the election, the report said. 
  The politician predicted that political realignment, 
including a merger of the ruling parties, would progress rapidly 
after the current Diet session officially approves a package on 
the new electoral system later this month, the daily said. 
  The package was passed in the Diet last month but because of 
time constraints no date was set for implementation. The 
current Diet session is slated to revise the bills. 
  Ozawa was quoted as saying that the new party would group 
people who think Hosokawa should be kept as the leader and who 
believe Japan should enact a basic security law defining Japan 
as a peaceful nation with the United Nations as its lead. 
  Ozawa also said the new party would stress a policy of free 
competition with relaxed regulations as much as possible, the 
paper said. "This idea will surely have many supporters," he 
said in the report. 
  Last summer, Ozawa defected from the LDP which surrendered 
its 38-year grip on power to the current coalition in August 
1993.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States have decided to hold the joint military exercise 
"Team Spirit" this year if the North Korean nuclear issue is not 
resolved, South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Friday. 
  Han said the two countries have also agreed to make a final 
decision on the deployment by U.S. Forces in Korea of Patriot 
missiles after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
discusses the issue at its Board of Governors' meeting Feb. 21. 
  Han made the statement at a press conference after meeting 
with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense 
Secretary William Perry earlier Friday. 
  Pyongyang and the IAEA are deadlocked over IAEA inspection 
of 
North Korean nuclear facilities. Unless some progress is made 
before the IAEA Board of Governors meets, the United States and 
its allies will refer the question to the U.N. Security Council 
for possible economic sanctions against North Korea. 
  "The deployment of Patriot missiles is still in the stage of 
discussion," Han told reporters. He and Perry have agreed to 
make a final decision after the IAEA Board of Governors' 
meeting, Han added. 
  As a result of his talks with U.S. Government leaders, Han 
said he was able to confirm that "there is no change in the 
basic approach of South Korea and the United States to the North 
Korean nuclear question. 
  "There is nearly complete agreement on countermeasures 
between the two governments," Han said. 
  Han's remarks were received as an indication that Seoul and 
Washington have agreed to pursue a peaceful solution to the 
problem until the issue is referred to the U.N. Security 
Council, if the IAEA Board of Governors judges that the 
continuity in nuclear safeguards in North Korea has been broken. 
  "I have agreed with Secretary Christopher that it is 
desirable to exchange opinions and adjust positions among the 
IAEA Board of Governors," Han said. 
  "South Korea and the United States have decided to hold 
close 
consultations before and after the IAEA Board of Governors' 
meeting and at every stage," Han added. 
  The international community will do its utmost to help 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and will respect and 
cooperate with any decision made by the IAEA and the Security 
Council, Han said. 
  China has played a "very constructive" role, Han said, 
adding 
that he expects Beijing will continue to make a positive 
contribution in practical ways. 
  In regard to Team Spirit, Han said South Korea and the 
United 
States will plan for and hold the exercise unless progress is 
made on the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  The content of President Kim Yong-sam's personal letter to 
U.S. President Bill Clinton was not disclosed, but it was said 
to favor persuading North Korea to resolve the nuclear question 
through dialogue. 
  If all efforts failed, South Korea would go along with any 
decisions by the international community, Kim was understood to 
have told Clinton.

<F P=106> [Report by Pak Tu-sik on 10 February news conference in </F>
Washington, D.C. by Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who left for the 
United States in a hurry with about 10 days to face the deadline 
for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue, 
held a news conference with his accompanying reporters and 
Korean correspondents stationed in Washington after meeting U.S. 
Vice President Al Gore on 10 February. The following is a brief 
of the news conference: 
  [Unidentified reporter] What do the ROK and U.S. Governments 
think is the reason North Korea is not allowing nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]? 
  [Han Sung-chu] There are various analyses. First, the 
restriction posed by the North Korean political and policymaking 
structure may be the reason. Second, it may be North Korea's 
negotiation strategy. In this case, it is possible that the 
situation will dramatically be reversed right before the IAEA 
Board of Governors meeting to be held on 21 February. The 
situation, however, would be pessimistic if we are under a 
fundamentally limited situation [kibonjok hangye sanghwang] 
(this seems to mean in case North Korea possesses nuclear 
weapons or feels uneasy for fear of the disclosure of its 
nuclear development), in which it is impossible to resolve the 
nuclear inspection issue. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is it possible to refer the issue to 
the UN Security Council? Does the ROK agree on this? 
  [Han] It is hard to ignore any possibility at present. We 
will continue dialogue to the last, but will seek an alternate 
effort [tarun chawonui noryogul moseakhal kosida] if our effort 
for dialogue ultimately comes up against a wall. We will 
respect the international agency's decision on the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Have you delivered our protest 
against U.S. media reports on rumors about a crisis on the 
Korean peninsula? 
  [Han] It is unreasonable to make a protest to the U.S. 
Government against those reports because they were made by 
independent U.S. media. However, I will express our concern 
about the fact that some media reports can make people 
misunderstand the current situation. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do the United States and North Korea 
have any intention to resume their contacts in New York? 
  [Han] The possibility of their exchange of opinion through 
New York remains open, but not the resumption of contacts. They 
may use some means of communication. They just think that this 
is better than nothing in order to improve the situation. The 
United States will, however, hardly attempt dialogue on its own 
initiative. 
  [Unidentified reporter] There is the rumor that the U.S. 
State Department's recent attempt to resume contacts with North 
Korea in New York has failed because of the objection by the 
U.S. Department of Defense. Is this true? 
  [Han] As far as the ROK Government knows, it is not true. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Could you confirm, through a series 
of talks, the confrontation between the hardliners and the 
moderates inside the U.S. Government? 
  [Han] It is not right to divide all matters into toughness 
and moderateness. The ROK and U.S. Governments have invariably 
maintained the position that they will try to solve the North 
Korean nuclear issue through dialogue, and if this method does 
not work, they will carry a stick, too. The mobilization of 
strong measures is being made by the international situation, 
not by the will of the ROK and U.S. Governments. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How will the situation develop after 
the referral of the nuclear issue to the UN Security Council? 
  [Han] The effort for dialogue will be continued even after 
the issue is referred to the UN Security Council, but the 
reality will make it difficult. Two methods are being 
considered. One is the gradual increasing of sanctions 
beginning with light ones, such as the adoption of a resolution 
urging North Korea to allow inspections and diplomatic 
sanctions, and the other is applying certain sanctions during a 
short period. They have not decided yet which one to choose. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do South and North Korea have any 
intention to attempt direct dialogue between themselves? 
  [Han] We have insisted on and urged holding South-North 
dialogue on the nuclear issue. North Korea, however, has not 
acceded to it. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What will be discussed if North 
Korean-U.S. dialogue is resumed at North Korea's request? 
  [Han] There are various possibilities. North Korea may 
demand that the United States lessen [wanhwa] the scope of 
nuclear inspections by the IAEA or that the United States 
confirm the inspections are not to be conducted as an obligation 
under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. The U.S. position 
is, however, that this is what has been agreed between North 
Korea and the IAEA. North Korea may also demand that the United 
States remove tension caused by U.S. moves, such as the 
reinforcement of its combat strength on the Korean peninsula, 
and guarantee the validity of the U.S.-North Korean agreement 
reached in New York late last year.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Saturday he was assured that 
U.S. policymakers wanted to leave channels with North Korea open 
if possible and try finding solution to the nuclear problem 
through dialogue up to the very last minute. 
  Winding up his first two-day agenda in the U.S. capital, Han 
told reporters that he came to understand that the chances of 
North Korea and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
reaching an agreement over nuclear inspections were slim but not 
entirely hopeless as reported by foreign press in discussing the 
matter with U.S. senior officials. He said he found the 
concern for a possible war in the Korean peninsula was very 
seriously spread among the U.S. press. 
  "I explained that the security situation in the Korean 
peninsula was not that serious as pictured in the U.S. press 
through interviews. I think the press views here have become 
more calm now," he said. 
  The foreign minister said Seoul and Washington agreed not to 
discuss the matter of deploying U.S. Patriot missiles in South 
Korea any more before the IAEA board meeting on Feb. 21 as not 
to provoke North Korea. 
  Noting a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement on Saturday 
urging Washington to be clear about the next round of bilateral 
talks, Han said he got the impression that Pyongyang's attitude 
has turned a bit softer, considering the statement highlighted 
that the United States wanted to continue talks with North Korea 
and the IAEA board meeting hinted at nuclear inspections to 
guarantee continuity of nuclear safety. 
  Han embarks on his four-day schedule in Canada on Sunday, 
stops by New York for talks with United Nations 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on Feb. 16, and visits 
Washington the following day for the second time.

  [Excerpts] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- With the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors' meeting 
only a week away, the United States and North Korea may meet in 
New York soon to resolve the deadlocked nuclear issue, a senior 
South Korean Government official says. 
  "A recent statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry 
spokesman that stressed the need to resolve the nuclear problem 
is a very significant change," said the official Sunday. 
  "This (statement) is a big turnaround from the attitude 
North 
Korea has taken until now," the official said, asking that his 
name be withheld. The statement heightened the possibility of 
resolving the nuclear question through dialogue, he said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Saturday's statement is a big departure from one issued on 
Jan. 31, in which Pyongyang said it would not hesitate to leave 
the NPT if the United States continued to press for a 
comprehensive inspection of all seven nuclear facilities in 
North Korea, the South Korean official said. The latest 
statement can be viewed as an expression of North Korea's wish 
to resolve the issue through dialogue, he said. 
  The South Korean Government plans to work with the United 
States to help resolve the nuclear problem in the wake of the 
North Korean statement, he said. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who has just visited 
Washington for talks with U.S. Government leaders, also 
evaluates the statement as an indication that North Korea has 
"softened" its attitude. 
  Han, winding up his U.S. visit, noted that Pyongyang has 
stressed its willingness to resume talks with the United States 
and that the IAEA still wants to conduct inspections in order to 
maintain continuity in nuclear safeguards in North Korea. These 
developments have helped improve the outlook for resolving the 
issue slightly, Han said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 14 
February in connection with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's 
current visit to the United States to tune the ROK-U.S. policy 
on the nuclear issue. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN in Korean carries on page 5 
a 
1,600-world article by Washington-based correspondent Yang 
Sung-hyon summing up Foreign Minister Han's visit to the United 
States. 
  Recalling that North Korea begins to show signs of change 
through its 12 February Foreign Ministry statement while Foreign 
Minister Han's U.S. visit was close to an end, the article 
analyzes that Foreign Minister Han attempted to deliver three 
different messages to North Korea through his U.S. visit. 
  The article says the first message is "the invariable 
efforts 
to settle the nuclear matter through dialogue." The article 
notes that the ROK and the United States, through in-depth 
discussions, were able to tug out an agreement to "open a 
dialogue channel to the last moment for the solution of nuclear 
problem." 
  The second message, the article maintains, is connected with 
"the reports on a crisis on the Korean peninsula and the United 
States preparing stern measures against North Korea." The 
article interprets Han's expression of mild gestures as a move 
to avoid the current situation on the Korean peninsula being 
termed as a crisis. Citing the ROK-U.S. agreement that if the 
North Korean issue was referred to the Security Council, UN 
action against Pyongyang should be taken in stages rather than 
through immediate sanctions, the article says Han made clear 
that "the ROK and the United States have no intention of driving 
North Korea to an extreme situation." 
  The third message, the article notes, is "an expression of 
firm will to use a stick if North Korea continues to hold out to 
the end." The article says that the ROK and U.S. Governments 
try to deliver a warning to North Korea that unless North Korea 
accepts inspections by the end of February, sanctions by the 
international community against North Korea will be "out of our 
hands." 
  The article sees that North Korea reacted to Han's such 
messages through its 12 February Foreign Ministry statement and 
concludes that "in this perspective, Han's visit can be 
evaluated as successful." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,400-word 
article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Pyong-chin on 
Foreign Minister Han's achievements during his U.S. visit. 
  Citing press reports focusing on possible military scenarios 
in case of war on the Korean peninsula, the article says Han, in 
connection with this, has calmed down the U.S. media's 
aggravated reports by pointing out detailed points. 
  The article continues that "the purpose of Han's U.S. visit 
is to narrow the differences in opinions for the solution of the 
nuclear problem and to make correct diagnosis of the reports on 
a crisis on the Korean peninsula by going into the epicenter of 
the reports." 
  The article then adds that "President Kim's personal letter 
to President Clinton also firmly reaffirmed ROK-U.S. cooperation 
over the nuclear issue and expressed "concern and 
unpleasantness" over the U.S. media's reports on a crisis on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The article concludes by saying that Han reassured the U.S. 
media that the current military movements on the Korean 
peninsula--including the recent reports on concentration of 
North Korean troops near the DMZ, deployment of the Patriot 
missiles, and resumption of Team Spirit exercise--are not 
something new aimed at preparing steps to countermeasure a 
possible crisis.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
had [a] telephone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa Monday afternoon to exchange opinions on 
matters of common interest including ways to cope with the North 
Korean nuclear question. Chongwadae [presidential offices] 
spokesman Chu Ton-sik said President Kim received a telephone 
call from the Japanese premier at 5 P.M. 
  In the telephone talks that lasted 18 minutes, the two 
leaders agreed that the nuclear question has entered a crucial 
phase and that it is important for South Korea, Japan and the 
United States to cooperate closely and take joint steps over the 
question, Chu said. 
  Hosokawa also informed President Kim about the contents of 
the talks he had with Clinton with emphasis on the nuclear 
question at their recent summit in Washington, he said. 
  The telephone talks were second of its kind held between Kim 
and Hosokawa in half a month. On last Jan. 29, President Kim 
called the Japanese premier to congratulate him on the passage 
of a controversial political reform bill through the Diet.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and 
Japan have reportedly agreed to seek gradual sanctions against 
North Korea under the accordance with the changes in the 
communist country's attitude toward its nuclear program instead 
of resorting to swift sanctions in case the problem is referred 
to the U.N. Security Council. 
  Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, meeting his Japanese 
counterpart Tsutomu Hata in the U.S. capital Saturday, widely 
discussed Seoul-Washington-Tokyo front on the North Korean 
nuclear problem and reached such agreement, Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said here. 
  Hata, in a clear show of change in past lukewarm position, 
expressed Tokyo's full support for economic sanctions against 
North Korea if necessary, Chang said. 
  Han explained that Seoul and Washington agreed to try 
dialogue to solve the North Korean nuclear problem to the last 
moment during his visit here and asked for Tokyo's cooperation. 
  Hata, expressing sympathy to diplomatic efforts, added that 
should the United States enter into sanctions against North 
Korea, Japan would cooperate under the boundaries of its law. 
  The Han-Hata meeting confirmed Seoul-Washington-Tokyo's 
comprehensive agreement and cooperation on North Korean nuclear 
issue, Chang said.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 10 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. State 
Department has acknowledged that the permanent members of the 
U.N. Security Council [UNSC] have discussed adopting a statement 
encouraging North Korea to accept nuclear inspections before 
sanctions are imposed against the communist country. 
  Department spokesman Mike McCurry made the admission when 
pressed to comment on reports that adoption of a statement 
urging Pyongyang again to permit outside nuclear inspections has 
been discussed by the council's permanent members. McCurry did 
not elaborate on whether the Security Council was moving to 
adopt the statement before the nuclear issue is referred to it 
or after. 
  Asked about the possible form of sanctions, McCurry said 
there has been no specific discussion since the issue has yet to 
be brought up formally. He said there were only informal 
meetings among UNSC permanent members to review the present 
situation and work out an agreement on the best possible means 
of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  As to speculation that China might exercise its veto power 
when the Security Council considers sanctions against North 
Korea, McCurry said Beijing has not revealed its official 
position on sanctions.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 (YONHAP) -- The permanent 
members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) will meet 
in Vienna, home to the Secretariat of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue, 
an official accompanying Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said 
Friday. Officials of the United States, Britain, France, China 
and Russia will hold discussions to prepare for possible 
referral of the problem to the Security Council, according to 
the official. 
  Han is visiting Washington to discuss ways to cooperate with 
the U.S. Government in dealing with the nuclear issue. 
  "Han and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher agreed 
in 
their talks that a meeting of UNSC members at the IAEA will be 
useful in finding joint measures to cope with the nuclear 
problem at this stage," the official said. 
  If the permanent UNSC members discuss the problem in New 
York 
now even though the problem has not yet been referred to the 
United Nations, it might unnecessarily provoke Pyongyang, he 
added. 
  "That's why they decided to discuss the problem at the 
IAEA," 
he said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 13 (YONHAP) -- While Seoul and 
Washington repeatedly pledged to continue dialogue to solve the 
North Korean nuclear issue, Pyongyang hinted at willingness to 
try more dialogue to approach the problem in a statement issued 
on Saturday. 
  A North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said Pyongyang was 
notified that Washington wanted to continue nuclear dialogue and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board meeting 
hinted its wish to conduct inspections to guarantee continuity 
of nuclear safety in an interview with the Korean Central News 
Agency. The spokesman added that such position was very good, 
drawing a great contrast with former angry and threatening 
statements from Pyongyang and hinting a change in its position 
on the nuclear issue. 
  "This (statement) is very meaningful change. It raises the 
chance of resolving the matter through dialogue," a senior 
government official said Sunday. 
  Although the statement was in the form of an interview and 
not an official announcement, it said there was no change in 
North Korean position to approach the nuclear problem through 
dialogue and urged Washington to act if it really wanted settle 
the matter by dialogue. 
  "It is a great change from the Foreign Ministry statement on 
Jan. 31 that threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty if the United States continues to demand 
fullscope nuclear inspections," the official noted. 
  Both Seoul and Washington cautiously view the statement a 
remarkable change in the attitude of the Stalinist country. 
  In Washington, visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu observed that the statement has raised the possibility 
of resolving the nuclear matter to some extent.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials from ROK vernacular newspapers published 
on 14 February on the future of the North Korean nuclear issue 
following the remarks made by a spokesman of the North Korean 
Foreign Ministry on 12 February and ROK Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu's recent visit to the United States. 
  The moderate CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word article by correspondent Pak Tu-sik from Washington 
on the possibility of a new turn in the North Korean nuclear 
issue. 
  Reviewing the contents point by point, the article analyzes 
that the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's 12 February 
comment implies another new turn in the North Korean nuclear 
issue, which has been aggravated since a statement was issued by 
a spokesman of North Korean Foreign Ministry on 31 January. 
  The article says that although it cannot be expected that 
the 
North Korean nuclear issue will be resolved through dialogue by 
21 February, it notes: "it has been confirmed that North Korea 
does want a breakthrough of the current situation which could 
only result in UN Security Council's measures." 
  The article notes North Korea's sudden assertion that it 
received "new facts" that the United States is willing to 
continue dialogue and that the inspections of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are purely for the continuity of 
safeguards--while the two conditions are not new at all--are to 
"accumulate pretexts for internal reporting procedures." 
  The article concludes that the behind-the-scenes 
communications between the United States and North Korea in the 
remainder of the week will be noteworthy. 
  The moderate CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial on the follow-up measures on the nuclear 
issue. 
  The editorial says: "If it is inevitable to seek resolutions 
in the frame of sanctions instead of negotiations, the 
government should clearly convey to North Korea that the 
sanctions are not threats but a reality, and should be prepared 
to clearly interpret North Korea's response." 
  Therefore, the editorial urges that a communications channel 
is established to quickly communicate our decision to the top 
decision maker in North Korea in order to prevent a crisis 
resulting from delayed communications. 
  If this does not work out, the editorial says crisis 
management measures should be sought at this stage. The 
editorial stresses that the most important thing at this stage 
is to cautiously manage the domestic systems in the ROK and the 
United States so that a prudent countermeasure to minimize the 
crisis can be carried out with a national consensus of opinion. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a 
600-word article by correspondent Nam Chang-sun from Washington 
entitled "Main Role and Supporting Role in Handling the North 
Korean Nuclear Issue." 
  Noting that there had been frequent contacts between South 
and North Korea a year ago for the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula, the article regrets that now the nuclear issue 
has become an issue to be resolved between North Korea and the 
United States or the IAEA. 
  The article analyzes that North Korea succeeded to exclude 
South Korea from the issue because "it was aware of the effects 
and limits of South Korea's carrots and sticks and disregarded 
them." 
  The article says Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's hasty visit 
to the United States to pull back the Clinton Administration 
from rushing into a hard-line position and to "confirm" that the 
U.S. policy on the North Korean nuclear issue was the same as 
ours, vividly shows the ROK's supporting role. 
  The article asserts that we should seek a way to play the 
main role in the North Korean nuclear issue because it is 
directly linked with our destiny. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 
a 1,400-word article by correspondent Yi Sung-chol from 
Washington analyzing the possibility of a breakthrough in the 
North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The article notes that the comment made by a spokesman of 
North Korean Foreign Ministry was announced on the same day 
NODONG SINMUN carried a hard-line commentary that any sanctions 
will be regarded as a proclamation of war, and quotes an ROK 
Government official as saying: "The NODONG SINMUN commentary 
and Foreign Ministry spokesman's comment can be analyzed as a 
fake operation." 
  The article reports North Korea seemed to have put 
considerable emphasis on the Foreign Ministry spokesman's 
comment because it even distributed copies of the contents to 
ROK and Western correspondents in the United States. 
  The article analyzes that "such a move of change resulted 
from the North Korean leaders' crisis awareness" as well as "the 
ROK Foreign Minister's efforts during his recent visit to the 
United States to create an atmosphere for North Korea's change." 
  The article worries that optimism can be destroyed at any 
moment if the real emphasis was on the NODONG SINMUN commentary 
and the other comment was a harassing tactic noting that no 
changes were seen in North Korea's contact with the United 
States in New York or with the IAEA in Vienna. 
  The article reports the ROK and U.S. Governments are 
establishing phased countermeasures while analyzing North 
Korea's real intent.

<F P=106> [Article by Beijing-based correspondent Yu Tong-hui: "What </F>
Is Beijing's Method of Solution?"] 
  [Text] With the beginning of the "march of crisis" of the 
North Korean nuclear issue toward the deadline of 21 February, 
people's attention is directed to China's attitude. 
  When the situation was dashing toward a catastrophe after 
North Korea declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty [NPT] on 12 March last year, what the 
people had to watch attentively was China's attitude. This was 
because China is the only nation that can exercise influence on 
North Korea and is a permanent member state in the UN Security 
Council whose consent is absolutely necessary when the Security 
Council takes procedures for sanctions against North Korea. 
However, as long as the North Korean nuclear issue is 
concerned, the Chinese side kept a consistent position, at least 
outwardly, whether in the situation of crisis or in the stage of 
negotiations. 
  China put forward as a precondition its position that 
neither 
the North nor the South of Korea should have nuclear weapons. 
Nevertheless, China maintained the position that the North 
Korean nuclear issue is a problem which should be resolved 
between North Korea and the United States; between North and 
South Korea; and between North Korea and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Proceeding from this position, 
China opposed referring the issue to the UN Security Council. 
Moreover, China maintained that the problem should be resolved 
through dialogue and persuasion, instead of sanctions. 
  The past one year can be called a course of application of 
the Chinese-style method of solution to the North Korean nuclear 
problem through dialogue. However, the resolution of the problem 
through dialogue has not been successful for the past one year. 
At this point, therefore, mere repetition of the Chinese side's 
basic position may be criticized as an irresponsible attitude of 
the nation with the responsibility for international problems. 
  Some people, however, predict that although China is 
outwardly opposed to taking procedures for sanctions against 
North Korea, it would internally give strong pressure to the 
North Korean side. China does not want to aggravate relations 
with Western countries, including the United States, even while 
maintaining its existent position. Besides, China is expected to 
play an active role in leading the situation in such a way as to 
resolve the problem through dialogue. 
  China presently has more favorable conditions than last year 
for exercising influence on North Korea. First, distrust caused 
between China and North Korea by the establishment of ROK-China 
diplomatic relations was removed last year to a considerable 
extent. Recovery of North Korea's trust in China would broaden 
the scope of China's persuasion of North Korea. Second, with 
persistent nuclear crisis, the degree of North Korea's economic 
reliance on China has been deepened. 
  However, even if the situation comes for China to take 
advantage of the card pertaining to energy, China will not 
likely use this card as the West expects. What one should pay 
attention to in observing China's attitude is the issue of 
renewing most-favored-nation status in early June. It is 
expected that the issue of renewing the most-favored-nation 
status will cause considerable discord because the Clinton 
administration put forward the improvement of China's human 
rights as a precondition. 
  This being the case, China will strive to gain maximum 
practical interest by opposing the West's method for solution to 
the nuclear problem to the maximum possible extent. The basic 
reason for China--a nuclear power--not to keep step with the 
West is the difference in views on whether the North Korean 
nuclear arms are an actual threat or a diplomatic card. 
  Unless clear evidence of the existence of North Korean 
nuclear arms is revealed to the public, "China's brakes" will 
likely continue in the future.

  [Text] It has been learned that North Korean President Kim 
Il-song is slated to visit China around April. 
  A high-level government source on 13 February revealed: 
"China and North Korea are supposedly discussing President Kim 
Il-song's visit to China," and added that "the timing is likely 
to be April, right after President Kim Yong-sam's visit to 
China." 
  It was learned that China's invitation to President Kim 
Il-song was made in the course of China informing the North 
Korean side of President Kim Yong-sam's itinerary. President 
Kim Il-song will reportedly hold a summit with Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin to discuss its nuclear issue and ways to enhance 
bilateral cooperation to help North Korea spur Chinese-style 
opening, said the government source. 
  The source said: "China is worried about being caught in a 
diplomatic dilemma in case the United Nations decides to impose 
sanctions against North Korea," adding, "Accordingly, China is 
expected to invite President Kim Il-song and will stress its 
stance of supporting denuclearization on the Korean peninsula 
and will induce North Korea to adopt the policy of Chinese-style 
opening to stabilize the North Korean system."

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Yun Kuk-han: "North Korea's Moves To </F>
Introduce `Chinese-Style' Opening"] 
  [Text] Concerning the visit to China by Hwang Chang-yop, 
secretary of the North Korean Workers Party and chairman of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, 
observers have recently affirmed that North Korea will soon 
officially declare the introduction of Chinese-style opening 
policy. 
  Such observation has persuasive power because of the fact 
that toward the end of last year North Korea finalized laws 
pertaining to opening up, including the law on lease of land and 
the foreign investment law, and that President Kim Il-song 
emphasized the trade-first policy in his New Year address. 
  The North Korean nuclear issue, which has been blocking 
external cooperation up to now, still remains unsolved. However, 
with the possibility of the resolution of the problem during the 
first half of the year, the people will pay attention to North 
Korea's moves toward opening up. In fact, North Korea was 
reported to have been suffering from economic difficulties, 
including negative growth, during the past three years. As the 
result, it is likely that North Korea will inevitably take steps 
for economic revitalization in any form, even for the sake of 
maintaining its political system. President Kim unusually 
admitted the failure in the third Seven Year Plan during the 
21st Plenary Session of the sixth party Central Committee last 
year. 
  Under these circumstances, North Korea dispatched Hwang 
Chang-yop, one of the real power holders within the government, 
to Beijing with a view to improving relations with China and to 
grasping the real situation of Chinese-style reform. It is 
believed that he visited China so that North Korea could review 
its own opening up. 
  During his stay in China for eight days, from 15 to 22 
January, Hwang Chang-yop intensively toured Zhuhai's special 
economic district, an agricultural science research institute, 
plants, enterprises and other major industrial facilities in 
Guangdong Province. 
  The government-operated Beijing broadcast reported that in 
meeting with Hwang Chang-yop, Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
explained the reform and opening implemented by China and on 
successes in socialist market economy, and that Hwang praised 
the achievements made by China in building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. It was also learned that before and 
after Hwang's visit to China, North Korea sent a group of 
economic experts to special economic districts and other areas 
in China in a bid to grasp the practical situation there. 
  Concerning such moves by North Korea, Hwang Pyong-tae, ROK 
ambassador to China, revealed that "North Korea recently sent a 
number of people to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, 
to personally learn from Chinese-style reform and opening by 
touring the actual sites and spots. Thus, something appears to 
be changing in North Korea." 
  North Korea also seems to be interested in economic 
cooperation with many nations in Asia, other than China, that 
have grown rapidly in recent years. Amid this situation, Kim 
Chong-u, vice chairman of the External Economic Commission, who 
is actually leading the economic opening up, revealed early this 
month North Korea's willingness to join the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation. Kim Chong-u toured Singapore, Thailand, 
Hong Kong and Vietnam last year. All these moves show that North 
Korea is seeking economic cooperation with other countries. 
  Experts in North Korean affairs note that North Korea 
already 
expressed its will to open up during the Sixth Party Congress in 
1980. That time, President Kim expressed for the first time the 
will to expand exchanges with capitalist countries. According to 
this, North Korea formulated the Joint Venture Law in 1984 and 
actively attempted to induce foreign capital. However, since its 
efforts were not successful, North Korea began to show interest 
in Chinese-style opening up through special economic zones in 
the nineties. In the earlier stage, North Korea believed that 
Chinese-style economic opening up would destroy the socialist 
political system at last. Therefore, North Korea tried to 
distance itself from it. However, seeing the economic 
development successes in the special zones in China and that the 
political system remained intact, North Korea seemed to have 
changed its mind. 
  This can be noted from the fact that President Kim Il-song 
and then Premier Yon Hyong-muk made consecutive tours to special 
economic zones in China in October 1991. In December of the same 
year, North Korea officially designated Najin and Sonbong in 
North Hamgyong Province as "free economic trade zone" as decided 
by the Administration Council. 
  President Kim Il-song openly expressed his interest in and 
support for China's economic reform during the events marking 
the 9 September holiday [DPRK founding anniversary] last year. 
  Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the Asian-Pacific Peace 
Foundation 
in the ROK, said that "North Korea, finally realizing that there 
is a road for economic development even by maintaining the 
socialist system, is advancing along this road." Thus, he 
stressed that North Korea has already begun to implement the 
policy of Chinese-style opening up. 
  North Korea is expected to attain the increase in employment 
and growth in the light industry through opening up and, thus, 
to upgrade the people's standard of living by revitalizing its 
stagnant economy. 
  On the other hand, it is likely that North Korea, while 
operating special economic zones in the district far away from 
the central area like China does, will apply laws and 
regulations pertaining to opening up only to these special zones 
so that the wind of reform will not influence other areas. 
  The prevailing consideration is that North Korea, with not 
as 
vast land and as large population as China's, may be able to 
prevent the wind of reform from expanding on a short-term basis. 
However, overall opening up of the entire society will be 
inevitable in the long run.

<F P=106> [Article by Yun Sun-hwan: "North Korea-China Border Trade"] </F>
  [Text] As North Korea-China border trade is expanding 
rapidly, the border areas along the Yalu and Tumen Rivers emerge 
as "strategic markets" that will lead North Korea to open its 
economy. North-South direct trade is still minimal, and there 
are limitations on the types of goods to trade. Therefore, it 
has been proposed that ROK business corporations positively 
utilize North Korea-China border trade as a means to promote 
"indirect North-South trade in order to lead North Korea to open 
its market and promote economic cooperation with North Korea." 
  The North Korean Economy Research Center of the Korea 
Development Institute released a "Report on North Korea-China 
Border Trade" on 11 February. The report says North Korea-China 
border trade, which is promoted in the form of barter trade, has 
been rapidly expanding by over 20 percent a year since the start 
of the nineties thanks to the successive measures by the 
governments of the two countries to expand bilateral trade. 
Even though exact figures have not been made public, the volume 
of North Korea-China border trade is estimated at over $100 
million in 1990 and over $240 million in 1992, which accounts 
for 35 percent of the total volume of bilateral trade. However, 
in many cases, business corporations involved in North 
Korea-China border trade tend to report reduced amounts of trade 
to authorities concerned to reduce customs duties and taxes. 
Therefore, the volume of border trade is estimated to be over 50 
percent of the total volume of trade ($300 million). 
  Border barter trade, which can be said to be rather 
primitive 
and unusual compared to other forms of international trade, is 
expanding rapidly between North Korea and China. This is 
because North Korea faces very serious shortages of daily 
necessities and hard currency. Through border trade, North Korea 
imports such daily necessities as textile goods (36 percent), 
groceries (31 percent), and chemical, electric, and machinery 
goods (17 percent) from China. In return, North Korea exports 
mineral products, fishery products, and antiques to China. Both 
countries prefer border barter trade over ordinary trade because 
they face shortages of foreign reserves and have no appropriate 
credit transaction system. 
  Therefore, to expand border trade, the two countries have 
reportedly taken measures to ease various restrictions and give 
tax breaks. Special customs rates, a mere 50 percent of 
ordinary rates, are applied to almost all goods in border trade, 
and procedures of trade have been simplified. The Chinese 
Government's "measure to ease trade management" eliminated 
almost all import restrictions toward the end of 1992, and a 
$180 million border trade contract covering 30 items of goods, 
the largest amount over the 10-year period, was signed at a 
North Korea-Jilin, China, border-trade fair last May. In fact, 
border smuggling trade, which is called "peddling," had been 
prevalent under governmental tacit approval. Therefore, the 
Chinese Government's measure to activate border trade is 
described as an approval of such "peddling trade." 
  Border trade is growing in areas along the Yalu and Tumen 
Rivers, close to the three Northeastern Provinces of China -- 
Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, and the Yanbian Korean 
Autonomous Prefecture of the Jilin Province and the border areas 
close to the prefecture are the most prospering markets. North 
Korea reportedly opened approximately 140 Chinese goods markets 
in Sinuiju of North Pyongan Province, Manpo of Chagang Province, 
and other areas last year to expand border trade with China. 
  The Korea Development Institute says: "In case North 
Korea-China border trade continuously expands, domestic business 
corporations must use North Korea-China border areas as a 
forward base for indirectly leading North Korea to open its 
economy." The institute also says that toward that end, 
domestic business corporations must have Chinese border-trade 
companies as agents or sign work agreements with Chinese 
border-trade companies to join in border trade in this region. 
The institute also says: There are "risks in trade" because of 
the infrastructural problem and the credit problem. However, 
given the fact that North-South trade is now being promoted 
through third countries, North Korea-China border trade will 
become an important means to lead North Korea to sell ROK goods 
in the North Korean market and open its economy.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- Two North Koreans sought 
asylum after arriving at Kimpo International Airport aboard an 
Aeroflot jetliner Sunday afternoon, the Agency for National 
Security Planning (NSP) said Monday. Choe Myong-hak, 34, and 
Kim Tae-pom, 32, arrived at Kimpo Airport carrying Russian 
passports, the NSP said. Kim was born in Songchon, South 
Pyongan Province, and Choe is from Najin, North Hamkyong 
Province. Both of the men left behind families in North Korea. 
  In 1989, they were dispatched to a lumber factory near 
Khabarovsk, Russia, where they worked as drivers. They left the 
factory last July and gained Russian passports using the names 
of ethnic Koreans there. Sunday's incident marks the first time 
that North Koreans have entered South Korea by plane and 
defected.

  [Text] North Korea is trying to use the labor movement for 
wage hikes and better working conditions in South Korea to 
achieve its goal of generating social confusion in the South by 
instigating workers here to strike. 
  Between late last year and Jan. 22, Radio Pyongyang aired a 
10-part lecture by a Kim Il-song University professor on 
"Several Problems Found in South Korea's Labor Movement," 
according to the official North Korea watcher, NAEWOE press. 
  The lecture was apparently aimed at stirring up social 
unrest 
in South Korea, as South Korean workers showed signs of 
cooperating with their employers to achieve industrial peace in 
support of President Kim Yong-sam's policy on increasing 
international competitiveness of South Korean products under his 
new five-year economic development plan, analysts say. 
  The lecturer, noting "a temporary retreat by the South 
Korean 
labor movement," said different views and theories voiced in the 
course of making a decision on the movement's direction should 
be blamed for this retreat and stressed the need for "a militant 
strike struggle." 
  Also, the Workers' (communist) Party newspaper, NODONG 
SINMUN, in a commentary carried in the Jan. 31 issue severely 
criticized President Kim Yong-sam for seeking industrial peace 
in recent meetings with business leaders, and urged South Korean 
workers and citizens to launch a struggle to overthrow the Kim 
Yong-sam government. 
  The Radio Pyongyang lecturer, defining workers as "the 
leaders of a South Korean revolution," said the South Korean 
proletariat's political line of action should be based on 
Korean's "chuche" (self- reliance) socialism rooted in the 
masses, adding that "chuche" thought should be "the guiding 
ideology of South Korea's labor movement." 
  Claiming that South Korea's labor movement has problems due 
to conflicting opinions in the leadership, he said "Kim 
Chong-il, the sagacious revolutionary leader, has provided the 
most scientific solutions to these problems." 
  In the fifth part of the lecture, noting that there are two 
theories in the South Korean labor movement--one for national 
unification based on proletariat liberation and the other for 
democratization before unification--he said both are wrong 
because they belittle the importance of the unification issue. 
  South Korea's labor movement should focus its political 
struggle on the unification issue because in South Korea's 
"colonial society under foreign imperialist rule, proletariat 
liberation and democratization cannot be achieved without 
national liberation from the imperialist colonial rule." 
  North Korea, seeing "the struggle for national unification" 
as being on a par with "the struggle against foreign aggressors 
and proletariat liberation struggle" calls on South Korean 
workers to fight for national independence and proletariat 
liberation. It also calls for united front of "all patriotic 
forces through struggle against foreign rule and dictatorship," 
as seen in the eighth part of the lecture. 
  According to this lecture, South Korea's labor movement 
should practice sabotage, strikes, demonstrations and riots, 
which should be employed not only in political and economic 
struggles but also in violent and non-violent struggles, lawful 
and unlawful struggles and large-and small-scale struggles. 
  The preference for one of the political and economic 
struggles over the other is "a leftist tendency," which South 
Korean workers must cope with "by equipping themselves with the 
labor movement methodology based on 'chuche' though to combine 
both political and economic struggles on an equal footing." 
  "The enthusiasm and mood of the masses aroused through the 
economic struggle must be directed to the struggle for political 
objectives," the lecturer said. 
  For instance, South Korean workers must direct the struggle 
for economic goals, such as wage hikes, improved working 
conditions and tax cuts, to that for the political goals of the 
release of political prisoners, revision of labor laws, freedom 
to organize trade unions, withdrawal of U.S. troops and 
overthrow of the government, he said. 
  To lead such a labor movement, the lecturer stressed the 
need 
for South Korea's workers to develop leaders of such dissident 
groups as the National Council of Trade Unions, the National 
Association of Industrial Unions and the Hyundai Group Trade 
Union Federation as a strong driving force. 
  This will help develop South Korea's labor movement into a 
strong political force, an important strategic goal, under the 
influence of the workers' party. 
  In the face of "the Fascist puppet regime's oppression," the 
South Korean proletariat must employ lawful, semi-lawful and 
unlawful approaches to organizing its own political party, he 
stressed. 
  In the final and 10th part of the lecture, the lecturer said 
strikes are the basic instrument for workers to achieve their 
objectives and commended South Korea's dissident unions for 
their leadership in past strikes. 
  The lecture was designed to create social and economic 
confusion and unrest in South Korea by instigating South Korean 
workers to take to the streets in a struggle against the Kim 
Yong-sam government's plan to increase competitiveness of South 
Korean goods in overseas market.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 12 (YONHAP) -- North Koreans across the 
country observed Lunar New Year's day on Feb. 10 by playing 
folk games, according to Radio Pyongyang as monitored by NAEWOE 
press, the official North Korea watcher here. 
  "Our people meet Lunar New Year's day, one of the 
traditional 
festive seasons, at this juncture of a forceful march toward a 
new victory, upholding the (Solar) New Year's day message (of 
President Kim Il-song), and cities and villages are filled with 
the rejoicing of workers, farmers and children playing such folk 
games as sledging, kite flying and top spinning," Radio 
Pyongyang was quoted as reporting on Friday. 
  The report, noting that Lunar New Year day is one of 
Koreans' 
three traditional festive seasons, said, "the people clean their 
houses on New Year's Eve to send off the passing year and put on 
new clothing and eat special food on New Year's day to meet the 
coming new year." 
  "The most important thing you must do on New Year's day is 
bow down to your parents and seniors in New Year's day 
greetings, as this is a custom observed on New Year's day only, 
and not in other festive seasons. 
  "In the past, poor workers could afford to prepare only one 
or two plain dishes on Lunar New Year's day and the only jovial 
way for them to spend the festive day was to play a folk game." 
  Radio Pyongyang was also quoted as reporting that North 
Koreans spent a joyful Lunar New Year's day "because of the 
sagacious leadership of Kim Chong-il in the preservation and 
development of the cultural assets of the nation handed down 
from generation to generation." 
  Pyongyang resumed observing Lunar New Year's day in 1989, 
not 
as a public holiday but as a "substitute holiday" -- meaning 
that North Koreans must work on a public holiday in exchange for 
a day off on this substitute holiday. 
  Just after the armistice ending the Korean war was signed in 
July 1953, North Korea stopped observing Lunar New Year, 
regarding it as a vestige of feudalism. 
  On Lunar New Year's Eve in February 1989, Radio Pyongyang, 
celebrating the holiday's restoration after 36 years of 
oblivion, reported the people could once again observe the day 
as a traditional festive season through "the good offices of the 
dear leader (Kim Chong-il)." 
  Celebration of Lunar New Year's day in North Korea appears 
to 
be quite different from South Korea. 
  In South Korea the first event performed by every household 
on this traditional holiday is a rite in memory of ancestors, 
but in North Korea this custom is not observed, according to 
North Korean media. Instead Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il are 
eulogized through propaganda praising the Kims for restoring 
Lunar New Year's day as a traditional festive season, with the 
people told anew to pledge their allegiance to this father-son 
dynasty by visiting a nearby statue of Kim Il-song. 
  In North Korea, Lunar New Year's day is not a day of family 
reunions, unlike in South Korea. 
  In playing folk games, however, North Koreans are not much 
different than their brethren in the South: Sledging, top 
spinning, kite flying and other games are played on both sides 
of the border.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 11 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Chong Tong-ho 
returned home on Wednesday after staying in Taiwan for about 10 
months. 
  Chong bolted from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party and 
flew to Taiwan soon after a controversy developed over his 
alleged accumulation of an illicit fortune last April. "I am 
sorry for neglecting my legislative activities and for failing 
to represent my constituents properly in the past," Chong said 
upon his return. He said that in Taiwan he had studied Chinese 
at Taiwan political college and received treatment for his 
arthritis. 
  Chong visited the national cemetery on Thursday and planned 
to call on National Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop and the two vice 
speakers on Saturday. 
  Regarding his fortune, Chong said he believed any suspicions 
had been fully swept aside following the Assembly Ethics 
Committee's investigation into the properties of assembly 
members. 
  "It is fortunate that the properties of myself and my family 
were found to have been made through legal means," Chong said. 
  Last week speaker Yi sent a message to Chong, telling him to 
return to the assembly forthwith or face disciplinary steps.

<F P=106> [`Summary' of `exclusive' interview with Georgiy Kunadze, </F>
Russian ambassador to the ROK, by Kim Yong-kol on 8 February -- 
place not given] 
  [Text] [Kim Yong-kol] What is your view on North Korea's 
nuclear issue? 
  [Georgiy Kunadze] Russia is displeased with North Korea, 
which is trying to receive "special treatment" within the 
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty [NPT]. In March 1993 North 
Korea declared that it would withdraw from the NPT, but has 
withheld that decision. North Korea can choose on its own if it 
will withdraw or remain in the NPT. As long as it has decided 
to remain in the NPT, however, I believe that as a member of 
international society, North Korea must sincerely implement the 
duties of preventing nuclear proliferation. North Korea must 
show a clear attitude regarding this matter. 
  [Kim] It was learned recently that the Russian Government is 
showing moves to repay ROK's loan through the transfer of 
military technology. 
  [Kunadze] The Russian Government regards the ROK as an ally. 
Therefore, I believe that there will not be any big barrier in 
transferring military technology. I believe that this issue 
must proceed from a purely private level and in accordance with 
international practice. If the quality is good and the price 
satisfactory, I do not know of any reason for the ROK not to 
purchase Russian weapons. This can be carried out in the form 
of a direct trade or possibly through joint ventures. 
  [Kim] How do you view the bombing of the Korean Air Line 
plane in 1983 and the issue of repaying the ROK's loan, which 
are regarded as pending issues between the two countries? 
  [Kunadze] The Russian Government has cooperated to find out 
the truth about the Korean Air Line plane bombing incident. I 
believe that the Russian side is no longer politically 
responsible. I would like to express profound sympathy for the 
victims and the bereaved families. Even though experts from 
Russia, the ROK, and other related countries carried out an 
accurate investigation and reached a united result, I doubt that 
this will by any means be a consolation to the bereaved families. 
  The issue of repaying the ROK loan is a slightly delicate 
issue. When Russia was burdened with the old Soviet Union's 
foreign debt, it reached an agreement with the Western creditor 
group on the principle of repaying debt. A condition was 
attached in that Russia cannot repay its loan with any other 
country before receiving approval from the Western creditor 
group. I would like to reveal that repaying the $3 billion debt 
to the ROK side is not that big a burden to Russia, but Russia 
can suffer economic consequences from the Western creditor group 
if Russia repays the ROK. 
  [Kim] Do you have anything to say to the ROK Government? 
  [Kunadze] Most of all, I would like to discuss the issue of 
returning the embassy lot situated in Chong-tong, Chung-ku, 
which was used during the Czarist days. The embassy building 
that we are currently using is situated in Samsong-tong, 
Kangnam-ku and is too far away from the center of the city, thus 
causing difficulties in conducting our work. 
  During the Czarist days, all embassy buildings in the ROK 
were built from soil and building material brought from their 
native countries. This is why we have such an affection for our 
embassy lot. China and Vietnam have been allowed to use the 
embassy lot that was used by the former Taiwanese and Saigon 
governments. I would appreciate it if this was considered. 
  [Kim] What is your impression of being appointed ambassador 
to the ROK? 
  [Kunadze] I have visited the ROK on many occasions before, 
but this is the first time I have assumed the duty of 
ambassador. I am working to get accustomed to Korean customs. 
The ROK is a safe country at least in public peace and order 
because there are not that many crimes such as highway 
robberies. However, I believe that the ROK is faced with 
serious social problems, such as water contamination and traffic 
congestion.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, Japan and 
Russia will conduct a joint test of the East Sea from next month 
for signs of contamination from radioactive waste dumped by 
Moscow, the Foreign Ministry announced Saturday. The three 
countries signed an agreement in Vladivostok to send out the 
4,000-ton Okean, a Russian survey vessel, to seven test points 
in the sea that lies between Korea and Japan. Okean will leave 
Vladivostok around March 10 and stay out for 31 days, the 
Ministry said. 
  A total of 32 surveyers, seven from South Korea, nine from 
Japan, 15 from Russia and one from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), will participate in sampling of the water, 
seabed and plankton. 
  Seoul and Tokyo were alerted and ired when they found out 
last fall that the former Soviet Union and Russia have been 
dumping nuclear waste into their adjacent seas for decades. 
  Plans for a joint survey were delayed over cost sharing, but 
the three countries finally agreed to bear the burden equally, 
the Ministry said. 
  On-spot test results would be out within one month after 
Okean completes its course, but the final analysis will be out 
approximately a year later. 
  Second set of survey will take place sometime in mid-year, 
the Ministry said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, Japan and 
Russia have agreed to jointly investigate radioactive pollution 
of the East Sea (Sea of Japan) by the former Soviet Union and 
Russia's dumping of nuclear waste, from March 15 for 31 days, 
the Science and Technology Ministry said on Monday. Delegates 
from the three countries signed a letter on the investigation in 
Vladivostok, Russia, on Saturday. 
  According to the plan, nuclear and marine experts from the 
three countries will leave Vladivostok aboard a 4,000 ton-class 
Russian ship, the Okean, on March 15 and conduct an 
investigation of seven points in the East Sea for 31 days. The 
experts will examine sea water, undersea soil and marine life. 
  Within a month after the investigation, the experts will 
submit a preliminary report and within a year, they will issue a 
final joint report. Seven experts from Korea, nine from Japan, 
15 from Russia and one from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency will participate in the mission, with the costs shared by 
the three countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Should Refrain From </F>
Indiscriminate Trade Offensive"] 
  [Text] Even amid the traffic hell created on the way home 
and on the return to Seoul, we enjoyed the Lunar New Year 
holiday. However, the situation outside the nation was not 
quiet. In addition to the North Korean nuclear issue to which 
the world is directing attention, the U.S. trade offensive has 
been strengthened with each passing day. The import of rice and 
beef has now become an old story. Following the pressure to 
open financial markets, expansion of automobile imports and 
protection of intellectual properties have become the imminent 
issues. Besides, in a meeting with the ROK minister of commerce 
and industry a few days ago, the U.S. Ambassador to the ROK made 
a strong protest against our court's decision to put the 
representative of the Korean branch of the U.S. Amway Company, 
who was previously brought to a summary indictment, on trial. 
He also expressed a deep regret for disadvantages inflicted on 
U.S. business firms last year by our government reversing its 
decision to designate firms for the mobile telecommunications 
project in our country. It was learned that during "talks for 
economic cooperation" to be held in Washington this week, the 
United States will demand the positive improvement in the tax 
system, custom clearance, financial restrictions, and 
management-labor disputes, as well as for establishment of an 
organization within the Economic Planning Board to exclusively 
handle the elimination of trade friction and improvement of the 
investment environment. In a nutshell, a special institute 
should be organized as a government office to promptly settle 
complaints put forward by U.S. business firms now operating in 
the ROK. 
  It appeared that with the resolution of Uruguay Round [UR] 
negotiations, the reorganization of the world trade order came 
to a temporary settlement. However, without even moments for a 
breath-taking thereafter, we became the target of concentrated 
fire attack by the United States. The UR agreement is a 
discriminative and unfair trade order which reflects the 
interests of only a few big powers. However, since they 
emphasized that this is the way for removing obstacles laid on 
the road of world trade, we cooperated by opening even our rice 
markets on which the nation's life depends. This being the case, 
those who led this negotiation should direct their utmost 
efforts on the operation of this system and should wait for its 
achievements. However, the U.S. attitude totally contradicts 
this. By taking advantage of the settlement of the 
negotiations, the United States has launched a concentrated fire 
attack on its trade partners, in particular, the ROK and Japan. 
An offensive and defense battle between the United States and 
Japan over the issue of establishing a so-called "standard of 
numerical value" to objectively prove the extent of import of 
automobiles and the degree of opening of insurance markets 
continued to the current U.S.-Japan summit. However, the two 
sides failed to bring about satisfactory results. In view of 
the enormous imbalance in trade income and outgo between the 
United States and Japan, the U.S. offensive against Japanese 
markets has considerable persuasive power. 
  However, as for the case of the ROK which suffers red 
figures 
in trade with the United States, the indiscriminate U.S. 
offensive is not only unfair but also insolent. The the United 
States' act of picking a quarrel over the ROK court's decision 
for trial and over the postponement of the mobile 
telecommunications project, which was inevitable after the issue 
developed into a heated political dispute, makes one doubt its 
true intent, going beyond pure economic interests. The ROK 
cannot import as many U.S. automobiles as U.S. imports of ROK 
automobiles because of the different standard of income of ROK 
consumers and their requirements, not because of trade barriers. 
Frankly speaking, it is not likely that the one who wants to 
buy a high-class U.S. automobile would give up its purchase 
because of a high income tax imposed at home. We are not in the 
position to revise our tax system merely for the sake of helping 
the sale of U.S. automobiles. We hope to maintain sound trade 
relations between the ROK and the United States and to promote 
mutual understanding on such relations. However, this cannot be 
achieved by unilateral pressure by one side and yielding to such 
pressure by the other. Trade is an economic issue. However, 
this issue would become very difficult to resolve if the 
people's ill feeling is involved. We ask the United States to 
exercise self-control so that ROK-U.S. trade relations would not 
develop into relations in which people's ill feeling is involved.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- A meeting of the 
International Policy Coordination Committee chaired by Deputy 
Prime Minister Chong Chae-sok on Monday afternoon fixed the 
final schedule for Korean market opening necessitated by the 
Uruguay Round [UR] talks. The schedule lays down concrete ways 
to open Korean markets in such areas as farm products, 
industrial goods and services. 
  The final schedule will be sent to the Secretariat of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) soon after being 
passed by the cabinet, rendering useless Korean farmers 
organizations' demand to re-open the Uruguay Round negotiations. 
  Member countries will submit their schedules to GATT by the 
end of March, with the final agreement on the UR talks to be 
signed in Morocco on April 12-15. The legislatures of GATT 
member countries must then ratify the agreement, which is to 
take effect on Jan. 1 or on July 1 of next year. 
  The schedule calls for industrial products' and fishery 
goods' range of tariff concessions to be expanded to 90 percent 
in number of items and to 87.5 percent in import amounts. The 
average tariff concession rate will be reduced to 8.1 percent 
from 17.9 percent in 1996. 
  As for the service sector, 78 items will fall under tariff 
concessions: In the previous schedule, which was submitted in 
October last year, such items numbered 80. 
  Also in the schedule, the Computerized Reservation System 
(CRS) and a future financial liberalization plan are offered as 
items subject to exemption of most favored nation (MFN) status.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The government will 
submit to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on 
Tuesday South Korea's farm market opening schedule for 1,298 
items under the Uruguay Round accord reached last December. 
  Revealing the schedule at a National Assembly Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries Committee meeting on Monday, Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae said it would not 
contain any cuts of tariff equivalent -- the difference between 
the world and domestic prices -- on rice. 
  Instead, under the Uruguay Round accord the government will 
allow a minimum rice market access of 1 percent of domestic 
consumption for imported rice in 1995 and increase the rate to 2 
percent in 1999, 2.5 percent in 2000 and 4 percent in 2004, 
while not tarifficating rice for 10 years starting in 1995, Kim 
added. 
  Regarding the 111 items due for tariffication under the 
accord, the schedule calls for a 10-percent cut in the tariff 
equivalents determined by the difference between world and 
domestic prices in the 1988-90 period. 
  For barley, potatoes and other items whose imports are 
currently minimal or zero, a minimum market access of 3-5 
percent of domestic consumption will be permitted, while for 
corn, soybeans and others whose imports currently stand at more 
then 3 percent of domestic consumption, the existing tariff 
system will apply. 
  As for the "balance-of-payments" clause items such as beef, 
pork and chicken, the schedule will apply the tariff rates 
already agreed with the United States and other countries. On 
red pepper, garlic, onions and other "non-concessional" items, a 
10-percent cut in the tariff equivalents is called for over the 
coming 10 years, Minister Kim said. 
  For 102 import-liberalized items such as mushrooms and 
carrots, the schedule sets forth a 10-percent cut in rates 
determined by multiplying their 1986 basic rates by 150 percent 
or more, while a special determining method will be used for the 
175 tariff cut preference items, including fruit juice and 
sunflower seeds. 
  Tariff cuts on frozen strawberries, soybean sauce and 813 
other items will be made on the basis of their basic rates in 
1986 or their concessional rates. 
  Minister Kim said the schedule would also call for a 
13.3-percent cut in farm subsidies and a minimum subsidy of 10 
percent of farming costs over a 10-year period ending in 2004, 
reducing total subsidies from 1,718 billion won to 1,493 billion 
won. But subsidies for grapes, silkworms and dairy products 
will be less than 10 percent of the cost, he added.

  [Text] The government has decided to reduce its 
agricultural subsidies by 228.6 billion won, which accounts for 
13.3 percent of current subsidies provided for items on the list 
for the government's subsidy reduction plan, over a 10-year 
period beginning in 1995. Accordingly, the government will 
reduce state subsidies for rice, barley, beans, corn, and rapes 
-- its prices have been maintained by the government by 
purchasing these items at a set price and making up for the 
price difference -- by 22.8 billion won a year. 
  The Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery said on 7 
February that it will reduce tariffs and tariff equivalences on 
14 basic farm products, excluding rice, and on 1,312 farm 
products by an average 24 percent by 2004. Accordingly, tariff 
equivalences on barley, corn, beans, potatoes, sweet potatoes, 
red beans, green peas, and red ginseng will be reduced by 10 
percent over 10 years.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The Ministry of Trade, 
Industry and Energy will eliminate 14 jobs for grade one through 
four officials by dismantling two bureau-class offices and five 
division-class offices under its downsizing plan announced on 
Monday. 
  Under the reorganization scheme to be implemented early next 
month, the three trade-related bureaus will be merged into two 
new bureaus -- one responsible for multilateral trade 
negotiations and the other for regional trade. 
  A new office of the trade councilor will be set up under the 
direct control of the vice minister, with the councilor acting 
as a roving ambassador responsible for trade negotiations with 
foreign countries, Minister Kim Chol-su said. 
  The industrial policy bureau will be expanded into two 
bureaus -- one for industrial policy and the other for 
industrial technology -- while the four industry-related bureaus 
will be reorganized into three bureaus -- one for machinery and 
materials, another for electronics and information and the last 
for textiles and chemicals. The four energy-related bureaus 
will be merged into three new bureaus -- one for energy policy, 
a second for petroleum and gas and the third for electricity. 
  The Korean Trade Commission will dismantle the bureau-class 
office of administration and investigation.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party (DLP) on Monday called on the government to seek 
ways to possess nuclear reprocessing facilities for the peaceful 
use of nuclear. 
  In a policy material it prepared and distributed to its 
lawmakers in connection with the upcoming National Assembly 
session, the DLP objected the idea of turning the South-North 
denuclearization declaration into an international treaty. The 
party said that if the declaration were made an international 
treaty, it would restrict Korea's use of nuclear reprocessing 
facilities for peaceful purposes. 
  "The question of nuclear reprocessing facilities should be 
dealt with in linkage with the issue of denuclearizing whole 
Northeast Asia," the paper said. 
  Since the denuclearization declaration is not an 
inter-country treaty but an intra-national agreement, the paper 
said, the declaration cannot be made an international treaty. 
  The policy paper also voiced negativism toward the possible 
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. It said there 
should be an ample review of the issue at the National Assembly 
before any decision is made on the deployment of Patriots. 
  The paper specifically noted that because of the 
geographical 
limitedness, there would be no sufficient time for Patriot 
anti-missile missiles to detect and intercept incoming North 
Korean Scud missiles. Besides, there is the suspicion that the 
United States seeks to deploy the missiles in South Korea as a 
prelude to the promotion of sales of their old-type Patriots to 
Korea. 
  The paper further indicated that the ruling party is not 
buying the reported offer of the Russian Government to produce 
sophisticated Russian weapons in a joint Russia-South Korea 
project. Such a joint scheme is prone to cause a confusion in 
South Korea's weapons system and accelerate the arms race 
between South and North Korea, it said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 12 (YONHAP) -- Splinter opposition 
party members and independent lawmakers will meet on Sunday to 
discuss creating a new negotiating group at the National 
Assembly, but prospects for realizing the plan in the near 
future have suddenly become hazy. 
  Leader Yi Chong-chan and member Chang Kyong-u of the New 
Korea Party, New Party for Political Reform Chairman Pak 
Chong-chan, Han Yong-su of the United People's Party and 
independent Yang Sun-chik will get together to try and iron out 
their differences in organizing a third group. 
  Under the law, a negotiating group is eligible only if it 
contains more than 20 lawmakers. Currently, the floor is 
limited to the ruling Democratic Liberal Party and main 
opposition Democratic Party. 
  Initially, 21 concerned lawmakers were to hold a meeting on 
Monday to officially announce the idea and register the new 
floor group on the following day, when the ad hoc National 
Assembly session opens. 
  But the schedule has become unclear as a few lawmakers are 
now saying there is no hurry. 
  "Although we may not register immediately, we will hold the 
meeting on Monday as scheduled," Yi of the New Korea Party said. 
  "The date is a bit too close for comfort and I say we take 
our time," independent Yang said, adding that he will think 
about attending Monday's meeting.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 12 (YONHAP) -- Exports of electronic 
products rose 50 percent in January over the same month last 
year, industry sources said on Saturday. The figure compares 
with 12 percent growth in January 1993 and, considering the good 
start, this year's aim of 16 percent export growth is likely to 
be attained with ease. 
  Samsung Electronics Co. led the pack with exports worth 630 
million U.S. dollars, up 57.5 percent. Exports of home 
electronic appliances rose 39.1 percent to 320 million dollars 
and shipments of electronic parts such as D-RAM chips jumped 
82.3 percent to 310 million dollars. This compares with 
Samsung's export target of 560 million dollars, as Japan's 
economic woes helped its rivals compete, a Samsung official said. 
  Goldstar Co. exported goods worth 250 million dollars, up 40 
percent, with exports to China surging 133 percent. Six million 
washing machines were exported, up 100 percent, and 47 million 
color television sets were sent overseas, up 62 percent. 
  "The export strategy of selling mainly high-value-added 
products and securing new markets in the Middle East and Africa 
made a great contribution to the export increase," a Goldstar 
official said. 
  Daewoo Electronics Co. registered exports totaling 125 
million dollars, up 42 percent, chalking up gains of 83 percent 
and 58 percent in the Middle East and China, respectively.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's cumulative 
car exports over the past 17-odd years had surpassed the 
4-million mark as of the end of January, according to the Korea 
Automobile Manufacturers Association. 
  In July 1976, Hyundai Motor Co. made the country's maiden 
car exports when it shipped some Pony's to Ecuador. After that 
modest beginning, South Korea had exported a cumulative total of 
4,004,688 cars by the end of last month. 
  In 1993, exports jumped 40 percent from the year before to 
an 
annual high of 638,544, bringing the cumulative total at last 
year's end to 3,956,990. 
  Exports last month totaled 47,698, causing the cumulative 
total to break through the 4-million mark. 
  South Korea needed 11 years and two months to export 1 
million cars, achieved in September 1987, followed by two years 
to hit the 2-million mark in September 1989, two years and eight 
months to pass the 3-million mark in May 1992, and then one year 
and eight months to reach the 4-million mark in January 1994. 
  In 1985, exports first hit the 100,000-unit level, with a 
record of 123,110, and the annual achievement reached the 
500,000-unit level for the first time in 1987 when Hyundai's 
Excel-model cars swept the U.S. market. 
  In cumulative export records by model over the past 17 years 
and seven months, Hyundai's Excel overwhelmed all others with 
922,526, followed by Pride (Kia) with 544,788, Lemans (Daewoo) 
with 396,946, Presto (Hyundai) with 310,503, Pony-Excel 
(Hyundai) with 252,757, Elantra (Hyundai) with 234,225 and Pony 
I and II with 217,496. 
  The association predicts that exports will increase 27.7 
percent to 815,000 units in 1994 and that the country will begin 
exporting 1 million cars a year in 1995.

  [Excerpt] The Philippines yesterday appealed for calm and 
called for continued dialogs to peacefully resolve the brewing 
international dispute involving North Korea's defiance to 
demands of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it 
allow inspections on its nuclear facilities. 
  Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday joined 
the 
call for a peaceful resolution of the dispute following reports 
of mounting pressure for international sanctions against North 
Korea if it fails to allow the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), a United Nations Agency, to inspect seven 
suspected nuclear missile sites in its territory. [passage

the cities of Davao, Cebu, Baguio, and Bacolod and panelists in

PTV-4 studio in Quezon City -- live; passages in italics in 
Tagalog] 
  [Excerpts] [Ricardo Puno] Mr. President it was 
mentioned that you were in Subic yesterday, and that's the news 
here in Manila, that you were in Subic because you went to meet 
with the president of Taiwan, and some expressed apprehension 
that the meeting will offend the People's Republic of 
China. What really transpired in Subic, and what did you 
discuss with the president of Taiwan? 
  [Ramos] [passage omitted] It was not an official visit; we 
did not talk about political matters, but we concentrated on 
trade and economic cooperation because that is allowed under the 
one-China policy. And why shouldn't I take advantage of that 
stopover, a very brief one about three hours, of the president 
of Taiwan, in as much as they are the biggest potential 
investors in Subic. They have already contracted for 300 
hectares in which they will put up 150 factories, and we will 
open up this area on 20 February. And for the purpose of 
developing that industrial site area, the Taiwanese have 
arranged for a soft loan to the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority 
under Chairman Dick Gordon, amounting to $23 million dollars, 
but that can be expanded to $100 million later on between the 
next couple of years depending on how fast there's a need for 
that loan. At the same time, we, on the part of the 
Philippine Government, we are putting in our appropriations 
there, which is called for there at the BCDA Law, the Bases 
Conversion Development Authority Law which includes Clark. 
  Now, as for those investments in Subic, another 
important matter we discussed is the joint ventures in 
agribusiness. This is an offshoot of what we just discussed 
with Ben Jochico [journalist in Bacolod City] in regard to 
sugar. It was quite very clear to me that the Taiwanese would 
want to contribute agricultural expertise as well as capital 
into the Philippines to develop joint ventures in agriculture so 
that at least they will have a nearby source of food products 
coming out of this joint ventures, because joint ventures 
allow them to produce at minimal cost. So I said that, by 
all means, we have the land and the farm labor available, and 
these are readily available in the northern part of Luzon, which 
is nearest to your country. [sentence as heard] But they are 
available elsewhere in the Philippines, and there is already a 
very active Taiwanese business group here, they have their own 
chamber of commerce. That could be the vehicle for the 
acceleration of this kind of partnership. [passage omitted]

television studio, moderated by Ricardo Puno at the PTV-4 studio 
in Quezon City -- live; passages in italics in Tagalog] 
  [Excerpts] [Godofredo Roperos, SUN STAR DAILY, in Cebu 
City] Mr. President: President Clinton has just lifted the 
economic embargo on Vietnam. The floodgates for investors to go 
to Vietnam is now wide open. Don't you think that this will 
affect the Philippines' potential for investment in our part of 
the globe? 
  [Ramos] You know, within three hours of our hearing of the 
lifting by President Clinton of the trade embargo in Vietnam, I 
issued a statement -- which already has been published in our 
newspapers, and that should already be there in Cebu by now 
because that was last week -- supporting the lifting of the 
trade embargo because in the overall, our assessment -- my 
assessment -- is that the opening up of trade all over the world 
-- especially here in Asia and the Pacific; our region -- will 
lead to advantages to the Philippines also. And we need not be 
panicked again by a possible competitor on the part of Vietnam 
in regard to the capturing of investments as well as the sale to 
the world market of similar products. 
  As far as I'm concerned, there could be some complimentarity 
between the Philippines and Vietnam. We can even be partners 
with each other to put out cheaper and high quality goods, even 
if our raw materials are about the same. We can also help 
Vietnam, as we have helped them in the deepest moments of their 
crisis since the middle 60's. We have good rapport with the 
people of Vietnam, and now even the government of Vietnam. We 
can help them in certain types of expertise because of our 
higher level of technical experience. 
  But I think most of all we should look at the advantages 
inherent in the Philippines itself. Labor costs are higher here 
than Vietnam, but I say that we are more strategically located 
in terms of Asia and the Pacific. We're the gateway here, with 
access both to the mainland of Asia as well as the Pacific rim 
of North America. We're also, I would say, better -- much better 
-- in communications. We don't need an interpreter in the 
Philippines to do international business in the Philippines. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Angelo Abarico, in Davao City] Mr. President: Prime 
Minister Mahathir of Malaysia was here last Sunday and he spoke 
about the need for intensifying trade among ASEAN members and 
spoke about AFTA, which is the Asean Free Trade Area. Today, 
Ambassador Negroponte of the U.S. Embassy in Manila was here in 
Davao and he also spoke about the need for more trade and less 
aid to this country. In fact, he said that the United States 
Government is phasing out aid to foreign recipients. He also 
spoke about the NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Area. 
  Mr. President, are we prepared to take advantage if there 
are 
any advantages in the AFTA? And are we prepared also for the 
possible adverse effects that might come through NAFTA? 
  [Ramos] [passage omitted] AFTA itself as a program was 
launched 1 January 1993 -- during my time -- as a result of that 
summit decision. So we are into it. What it envisions over the 
next 15 years after 1993 is a gradual reduction of tariffs 
within our six countries in ASEAN, so that at the end there is 
nothing bigger than a 5 percent tariff. Now, in between are 
milestones that we must achieve also, meaning we lessen the 
number of items which are to be benefited by protective tariff. 
At the same time, we reduce the rate of tariffs. In general, 
that is what is the agreement in AFTA. 
  With NAFTA, I have said that there are 
complimentarities in NAFTA and AFTA. It is not necessarily one 
against the other, or they are not necessarily mutually 
exclusive. Although in two areas... [pauses] You people 
in Bacolod, listen to this. Regarding sugar, that might be 
threatened. Garments might also be threatened, because these 
are Mexican products, and it is easy to bring them into the 
United States. Under a NAFTA situation, there could be 
lowering of tariffs also, and so their products -- coming from 
Mexico for sugar and garments -- might be more competitive than 
ours. But so far, we have been assured by the U.S. Government 
that Philippine sugar and garment products will not be 
jeopardized. In fact, the quota for garments has 
been increased as between the Philippines and the United 
States, and we're seeing this as a very good opportunity for 
expanding exports in garments to the United States. 
  During the APEC meeting in Seattle last November, I 
emphasized that since we are in the middle of it -- we have both 
AFTA and NAFTA historical connections -- we should try to look 
for the complimentarities between the two systems. Meaning 
our garments have an advantage, because it is not 
necessarily true that just because Mexico is nearby, that they 
can produce products needed in the United States better than 
those of us in the Philippines. That is not necessarily true. 
So let's look for our comparative advantage, even if there is 
NAFTA. Then let's press on that because we have also this 
advantage of proximity if we are looking at the Pacific states 
of the United States and even Canada itself. [passage omitted] 
  [Hector Villanueva, MANILA CHRONICLE, in the PTV-4 studio] 
What are the most urgent reforms or legislations are you 
pursuing now? 
  [Ramos] Well, I told you Chito that out of that 
legislative- executive minisummit, or caucus, we came up with 
about 15 agreed key priority, urgent legislative proposals. 
Now, when we discussed this with the people in the 
multisectoral survey, or summit, this ballooned to about 93 
executive-legislative proposals. But we have refined that since 
then, and this was done as a result of the agreement to cease 
fire the unicameral issue, about three weeks ago. 
  Before they resume their sessions on 24 January, and the 15 
top bills, if I remember, are: Amendments to the BOT 
[build-operate- transfer] law -- this is now being done in the 
Senate under Senator Arroyo; the liberalization of the banking 
system; the amendments to the Foreign Investments Act, FIA; the 
so-called higher education bill; the dual education and training 
system, meaning private sector must come in to help in the 
transfer of science and technology to our young people; 
refinements to the VAT [value added tax]; the improvement of our 
geothermal exploration effort, because certain incentives will 
be added there; the upgrading of science and technology in our 
country; and then there is that body of laws, resolutions, 
ratifications, related to the Uruguay round of GATT so that the 
Philippines can accede to the forthcoming world trade 
organization; and then there is a set of bills on population 
stabilization. 
  Now, it is not all tax measures, but some of them are 
revenue 
enhancement in terms of organization, policy, computerization, 
etc., and I think they agreed on this being the calendar for the 
next several weeks in both houses in Congress. [passage omitted] 
  I am very confident that our economy is on the verge of 
take-off. In 1993, the economy performed very well in spite of 
the fact that we achieved targets not as high as our neighbors. 
We are also enjoying unprecedented stability as well as social 
cohesion. If we use as a base the fine cooperation 
between the executive and the legislative, that is something in 
our favor. 
  We are also seeing now a greater appreciation of our 
neighbors around us of the value and the worth of the 
Philippines as an investment, tourism, and trade destination. 
The result is the influx of investors and visits by high 
government officials and just plain tourists. One of the 
fruits of our making visits abroad last year are the return 
visits of our colleagues in government, and they always bring 
with them large trade and investment delegations, like 
last week, when Prime Minister Mahathir came here, and 
yesterday, very quickly, President Li of Taiwan, and there 
will be some more coming as scheduled. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The government is not closing the door to 
negotiations with the National Democratic Front, Ambassador 
Howard Dee, said yesterday. 
  Disputing that interpretation made by exiled communist 
leader 
Jose Ma. Sison, Dee, head of the government panel negotiating 
with leftist rebels, said, "We merely stated that given our 
objective to attain peace everywhere in the country, and the 
reality of the serious rift within the CPP/NPA/NDF [Communist 
Party of the Philippines/New People's Army/National Democratic 
Front], then peace talks with Messrs. Sison and (Luis) Jalandoni 
alone would no longer be adequate." 
  Although implying that the government would be willing to 
talk with groups that broke away from the CPP, Dee yesterday 
reiterated that such groups must first stop their terroristic 
activities. 
  "We categorically state that the GRP [Government of the 
Republic of the Philippines] Peace Panel had no intention of 
entering into peace talks with any group, including the Alex 
Boncayao Brigade [ABB], under threat of violence and coercion."

  [Excerpt] There is no deadline for communist rebels to 
resume peace talks with the government, the chief peace 
negotiator for the Left said yesterday. Former Ambassador Howard 
Dee told reporters in Malacanang that he will consult with peace 
advocates to explore avenues to save the talks from collapsing. 
But he asked the warring factions in the communist underground 
to stop dragging government officials into their conflict. 
  "We cannot talk on the basis of an environment where we are 
being threatened with physical harm, not the panel itself but 
government officials, institutions that they have threatened," 
Dee said. "So when they (communist rebels) are ready, they can 
always come to tell us that they want to talk. It takes two to 
tango. You cannot force them to come to us," he said. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] Sison, CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines] 
founder, denounced chief government negotiator Howard Dee for 
expressing willingness to talk with breakaway communist groups. 
  Gregorio Rosal, alias Comrade Roger, CPP spokesman, also 
issued strong statements against Dee. Rosal said the Alex 
Boncayao Brigade (ABB), headed by Felimon Lagman, is a vigilante 
group working with the military. 
  "The Ramos regime bears full responsibility for closing the 
door to any kind of talks with the NDF (National Democratic 
Front)," Sison said in a statement from his base in Utrecht, the 
Netherlands. Sison said Dee revealed the government's decision 
to get out of peace talks with the NDF in a statement issued by 
Dee on 5 February. [passage omitted] 
  "Dee is in effect delivering the message to the 
revolutionary 
forces that they must continue to wage the people's war," Sison 
said. "Howard Dee is more interested in being a psy 
[psychological]-war agent of the Ramos regime than in looking 
for a way to the negotiating table. He is below the caliber and 
style of Representative Jose Yap," he said. Yap was 
presidential emissary to the NDF during the exploratory talks in 
September last year in the Netherlands. 
  Sison said it will be futile for Dee to "pretend that the 
Lagman gang is something that the regime can negotiate with." He 
said the NDF had in fact demanded that the government stop 
coddling and using the "criminal Lagman gang" as a tool to 
"sabotage" the communist movement before peace talks can proceed. 
  Sison said Dee's statement was meant to "deflect public 
attention from the outrageous raising of oil prices and 
electricity and power rates." In a separate statement, Rosal 
said the ABB's bombing of the three oil companies following the 
increases last 28 January was aimed at sabotaging the peace 
talks. [passage omitted] "From being part of the NPA [New 
People's Army], the ABB has become a vigilante group and worse 
as an instrument of the U.S.- Ramos regime," Rosal said.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said yesterday that he 
was not prepared to welcome Taiwan President Li Teng-hui, who is 
arriving on a private visit. 
  President Li Teng-hui is visiting several ASEAN countries, 
including Indonesia and the Philippines, on a swift and vehement 
"money diplomacy" offensive. He is scheduled to arrive in the 
southern province of Phuket for a vacation. An earlier source 
said that Prime Minister Chuan would meet President Li Teng-hui 
on this famous island on the western coast of southern Thailand. 
  Responding to this report, Prime Minister Chuan said that 
the 
Thai Government adheres to a "one China" policy. Prime Minister 
Chuan said that the Foreign Ministry has already stressed 
Thailand's policy in this regard. The prime minister said, 
however, that Thailand has maintained good relations with 
Taiwan. These relations are economic; they involve members of 
the private sector and have nothing to do with politics. The 
prime minister said that Thailand has to be careful in the way 
it handles some sensitive issues because it adheres to a "one 
China" policy. In particular, Thailand has to honor its 
diplomatic commitments, because it has good relations with its 
neighbors. Thus, it is able to clarify some issues.

  [Text] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui and his 40-member 
delegation will visit Thailand as tourists and are scheduled to 
hold talks with Thai business people during their vacation in 
Phuket Province from 14 to 16 February. In this regard, Sutchit 
Nimitkun, governor of Phuket Province, held a closed-door 
meeting with some 20 officials at Dusit Lagoona Resort Hotel on 
13 February to map out reception for the Taiwanese leader and 
his delegation. 
  The Dusit refused to answer any questions, saying the 
meeting 
is a regular event. However, it was reported that the meeting 
discussed the reception and security measures for the Taiwanese 
delegation. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan will also come 
to meet the president during his stay in Phuket. It was 
stressed during the meeting that officials concerned must avoid 
giving any news about the visit to the mass media for fear of 
affecting the good relations between Thailand and China. 
  A source revealed that Amnuai Wirawan arrived in Phuket on 
12 
February and has been staying at the Dusit Lagoona Resort Hotel. 
However, the place where the Taiwan delegation will stay has 
been kept secret. Amnuai was seen at Thai Muang Golf Course in 
Phang-nga Province, presumably inspecting the readiness of the 
golf course, where the Taiwanese visitors and Thai businessmen 
will play friendship matches.

  [Excerpts] Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan flew to 
Phuket yesterday for a "round of golf" with visiting Taiwanese 
President Li Teng-hui, who is due to arrive today on an 
controversial private visit, an official source said yesterday. 
  Li's private plane is due to touch down in Phuket about 11 
am 
from Bali, in Indonesia, an informed source said. Thailand is 
the third and last stop of Li's Southeast Asian tour--which has 
drawn protests and veiled threats from Beijing. He also visited 
the Philippines. 
  The Taiwanese president will stay at the Pacific Island Club 
Hotel, where Amnuai will host a dinner reception for him 
tonight, the source said. Deputy Labour and Social Welfare 
Minister Phaithun Kaeothong is also to meet Lee for talks about 
the Thai labour market in Taiwan. Amnuai and Phaithun are both 
members of the New Aspiration Party (NAP). 
  There are about 30,000 Thais working legally in Taiwan, and 
an estimated 40,000 working without permission. [passage omitted] 
  Li will spend tomorrow playing golf with senior Thai 
businessmen--Chatri Sophonphanit, of the Bangkok Bank, Uthen 
Techaphaibun, of the Bangkok Metropolitan Bank, Saman Ophatwong, 
a major rice exporter to Taiwan, and Wisit Wirasithom, owner of 
the Wall Street Tower--and go sightseeing at Pang-Nga Bay, the 
source said. Tomorrow night he will host a return dinner party 
for Amnuai and the businessmen at the Sheraton Hotel. [passage 
omitted] 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri have stressed the govemment's adherence to a one-China 
policy. However they also said senior people from Thailand's 
economic partners, such as Taiwan have a right to make private 
visits. 
  Chuan, unlike Ramos and Suharto, has refused to receive Li 
during his three-day visit. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Speaking to reporters, Deputy Prime Minister 
Amnuai Wirawan denied a report that President Li Teng-hui would 
visit Thailand as his guest. But he did not rule out the 
possibility of meeting with President Li Teng-hui. He said: "I 
don't know whether I will meet him or not. Even if there is a 
meeting, it will not be an official one. I think that it is 
acceptable if one wants to have a private meeting with an old 
friend." 
  He said that President Li Teng-hui's visit to Thailand is 
simply a vacation trip which has nothing to do with the Thai 
Government. Such a visit will not undermine Thai-Chinese 
relations. He said that Thailand upheld the policy of having 
political dialogue with Beijing only, and not Taiwan. Thailand 
only has economic relations with Taiwan, which includes 
investment, labor, and technology exchanges. [passage omitted]

  Chuan said Thailand had the freedom to allow any visitor 
into 
the country. He reaffirmed the government's adherence to a

trip to Thailand. 
  " We should show principles in conducting our (foreign)

"Otherwise the Dalai Lama could not have visited Thailand." 
[passage omitted] 
  The Chinese ambassador to Thailand, Jin Guihua, on Monday 
delivered a protest note to the Foreign Ministry, warning 
Thailand not to approve Li's visit. [passage omitted] 
  The premier said previous exchange trips between Taiwanese

the past were normal for countries with economic relations.

  [Excerpts] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui is making use of 
the Chinese New Year break to tour Indonesia and Thailand. 
Although the trip is announced as private, the PRC is certain 
to react unfavorably because Beijing will try to impose its "One 
China" policy on the countries with which it maintains relations. 
  Indonesia does not appear to pay much attention to China, as 
evidenced by the reception accorded by President Suharto to the 
Taiwanese president. By contrast, the Thai Government will not 
have any official part in the Taiwanese president's visit. 
  On behalf of the Thai Government, Foreign Minister Squadron 
Leader Prasong Sunsiri stated that Thailand firmly maintained 
the "One China" policy and that the government had nothing to do 
with the Taiwanese president's visit. He said Li's visit 
concerned trade and investment matters and did not involve 
international political activities. [passage omitted] 
  Thailand has been a good friend of China. It has graciously 
implemented correct policies regarding China and Taiwan. 
However, taking into account the national interests, there is 
no reason for Thailand to neglect economic relations which could 
grow as result of the Taiwanese president's private visit. This 
is the way every country in the world operates. 
  We are confident that the Thai foreign ministry will be able 
to explain and gain China's understanding. We also are 
confident that China will be broadminded enough to accept the 
undeniable reality.

  [Excerpts] The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok yesterday 
continued to show Peking's "concern" about the private visit to 
Thailand of Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui next week. 
  National Security Council [NSC] Secretary General Charan 
Kunlawanit said the Chinese Embassy counsellor called on him at 
Government House yesterday to express his government's "concern" 
about Mr. Li's visit which will begin on Monday. 
  He said he told the Chinese envoy that the visit was private 
and had nothing to do with any state agencies, including the 
NSC. The invitation was extended to the Taiwanese president by 
the Thai private sector, and the visit was, therefore, not 
recognized by the government. 
  Gen. Charan said the Chinese envoy was concerned that the 
visit, although private, might affect good relations between 
Thailand and China. He said he assured the envoy of Thailand's 
strict adherence to the one-China policy and asked him not to 
worry too much. He said he was not aware of the full details of 
Mr. Li's itinerary except for a vacation in Phuket. [passage 
omitted] 
  Gen. Charan said he exchanged views with the embassy 
counsellor about regional cooperation on narcotics suppression. 
  Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said that 
no 
Thai cabinet ministers would meet the Taiwanese president either 
in their official or private capacities. He said he had no plan 
to meet Mr. Li, and would turn down such a request if one was 
put to him. [passage omitted] 
  Asked if there was any possibility of the Taiwanese 
president 
discussing economic issues with economic ministers, Sqn. Ldr. 
Prasong said "no." 
  The minister said he did not pay attention to details of the 
visit when asked if he knew how many days Mr. Li would stay in 
Thailand. 
  Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa stressed the 
private 
nature of President Li's trip, and said Thailand was a free 
country open to visitors. The spokesman said there was 
substantial business activity between Thais and Taiwanese, and 
that a large number of Thais were working in Taiwan.

  [Text] Bangkok -- Fiscal Policy Office Director General 
Somchai Ruchuphan yesterday denied U.S. allegations accusing the 
Thai tax system of not meeting international standards, and said 
the U.S. itself has used the same tax methods Thailand uses on 
certain products. 
  The director, in response to U.S. condemnation of the tax 
system in Thailand, said Thai tax calculation is based on the 
quantity and price of goods purchased, much the same as in many 
foreign countries. However, according to the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), taxes must be levied as a 
percentage of the value of the goods. 
  Thailand uses this method because tax on some kinds of 
products can not be easily calculated. For example, the Customs 
Department sometimes fails to receive the correct prices of 
import products from the importers. 
  A product may be priced at 1,500 baht, but the information 
given to the department claims that the price is only 1,000 
baht. The system of Thai taxation has been quite effective for 
the most part, Somchai said, but he admitted there is still room 
for improvement. 
  Economics Business Department Director General Kroekkrai 
Chiraphaet reaffirmed Somchai's statement and said the United 
States, along with several other foreign countries, is 
responsible for accusing Thailand of violating tax regulations 
as well as making some changes to its collection system which 
was supposedly agreed upon in the GATT. The accusations are not 
entirely true, he said.

  [Text] The Defence Ministry has asked the Cabinet to speed 
up an agreement on bartering agricultural products for a fleet 
of six Italian G-222 aircraft before the price soars out of 
reach, a source said yesterday. 
  The source said the Cabinet, on 2 November last year, 
resolved that the Ministries of Defence, Commerce, Agriculture, 
and Foreign Affairs negotiate with the Italian government to 
barter farm produce for six G-222 planes on behalf of the Royal 
Thai Air Force. But to date, the ministries have not been able 
to finalise details of an agreement with the Italians and 
further delay will likely mean that the price of the aircraft 
will become too expensive. 
  The aircraft, worth about 3.4 billion baht including spare 
parts and the cost of training, would be accounted for in the 
fiscal period to 1998. 
  To accelerate the barter process, the Defence Ministry has 
proposed the Cabinet assign the ministry to handle the task. 
Alternatively it suggested waiting until the four ministries 
come up with some solutions, but this would have to be soon. 
  According to the source, the Defense Ministry preferred 
forwarding the issue for debate by the Cabinet, so as to avoid 
further delay.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Amnuai Wirawan was on a 
visit to the Union of Burma to attend the second ministerial 
meeting on cooperation in narcotics suppression between the 
Union of Burma, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and 
Thailand, which was held in Rangoon on 10 February. Commenting 
on his visit, Dr. Amnuai said that Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
might visit the Union of Myanmar [Burma] in the near future in 
order to forge ties between the leaders of the two countries in 
their pursuit of national development, especially in the areas 
of investment. Amnuai said the Burmese Government has in the 
past few years adjusted its policies in line with economic 
realities, and has opened up the country more for foreign 
investment. Several countries have already had investment 
ventures in Burma. They are, for example, the United States, 
Japan, and South Korea. 
  Concerning Thailand, the deputy prime minister noted that, 
although Thailand's investment in Burma has been recorded as 
high as 220 million U.S. dollars, there is still little 
investment in major projects such as opening factories. It is 
hoped that there will be bigger projects in future. Thailand 
should explore new possibilities for investment in Burma, taking 
into account the advantages offered by Burma, such as its cheap 
labor and rich natural resources. Besides, investment in Burma 
will involve new technologies, especially the development of 
telecommunications, and communications infrastructure. Burma 
also needs technical cooperation to develop its natural 
resources, including mineral ores and zinc; its water sources, 
including the Salween River; and its natural gas deposits. 
  The deputy prime minister said both sides agreed in 
principle 
about cooperation, but some obstacles emerged when they went 
into details. He therefore proposed that there should be a plan 
on cooperation. In 1993, Thailand proposed to the Burmese 
Government a draft memorandum of understanding on the 
development of the Salween River for irrigation and for power 
generation. It is still being studied by the Burmese 
Government. Meanwhile, the Thai private sector, namely, the 
Petroleum Authority of Thailand, also has a plan to buy natural 
gas from the Gulf of Martaban in Burma. A survey has been made 
for the laying of gas pipelines. What is left to be done is 
price bargaining with the Burmese authorities. Regarding 
logging in Burma, Dr. Amnuai Wirawan said Burma had no policy to 
block off the trade, but it said it needs time to make a survey 
of Burma's natural resources in order to plan a long-term 
exploitation. On this, Thailand offered to cooperate with Burma.

  [Excerpt] Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Surin Phitsuwan 
reported after his return from an official visit to Indonesia on 
7-8 February that he held consultations with Indonesian Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas on the strengthening of bilateral ties and 
the implementation of the Growth Triangle program involving 
Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia. The deputy foreign minister 
said that both sides agreed, after discussion, to set up a 
consulates in each country. Indonesia wanted its office set up 
in Songkhla Province, whereas Thailand would open its in Medan, 
north of Sumatra. The date for the opening of the offices has 
not been decided. Surin said they also discussed an amendment 
to the agreement on the avoidance of double taxation and on 
investment protection. It is expected that the two countries 
will be able to sign the agreement during the second meeting of 
the joint Thai-Indonesian general committee, which is scheduled 
to be held in Bangkok on 23-26 August. The Indonesian foreign 
minister will be here to jointly chair the meeting with the Thai 
foreign minister. 
  The Thai deputy foreign minister and the Indonesian foreign 
minister also discussed the problem of violations of Indonesia's 
exclusive economic zone by Thai fishing trawlers. Both sides 
shared the view that, in order to solve the problem, the issue 
must not be treated in isolation, but there should be a contol 
on investment in industries related to fishery such as the 
setting up of ice factories. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said 
in an interview with newsmen that the Lao Government had asked 
Thailand for a special reduction on duties collected on imports 
from Laos. Laos said it is a poor landlocked country which has 
good brotherly relations with Thailand. The tariff reduction 
would help promote Laos' exports through Thailand. Suphachai 
said the Coordinating Committee on Economic Affairs Policy 
considered that Thailand should comply with Laos' request. 
Thailand has already granted special tariff reductions for 
several categories of goods from Laos. The committee had put 
the Foreign Trade Department of the Commerce Ministry in charge 
of negotiations with Laos. Thailand also wants Laos to reduce 
transit fees on trucks from Thailand -- now collected at the 
rate of 2,000 U.S. dollars, or about 50,000 baht, per trip. 
  The deputy prime minister reported that at yesterday's 
meeting the Coordinating Committee on Economic Affairs Policy 
endorsed the U.S. Government's proposal to set up a joint 
advisory committee on economic affairs, with full power in 
decision making regarding negotiations on trade and economic 
cooperation. Asked about the U.S. Government's decision on 
Thailand's status as a country on its Priority Watch List, or 
PWL, facing retaliation under the U.S. trade law, the deputy 
prime minister said it was very likely that the United States 
would remove Thailand from the list, but it is still not known 
when. This is because of Thailand's good record in cracking 
down on violations of U.S. copyrights, including the pirating of 
copyrighted video tapes and discs.

  [Text] Rangoon, Feb 14 (AFP) -- A US Congressman and a UN 
official met Burmese dissident Aung San Suu Kyi here Monday -- 
the first outsiders to see her since she was put under house 
arrest in July 1989. Five people, including Congressman Bill 
Richardson (Democrat-New Mexico) and the United Nations 
Development Program resident representative in Rangoon, were 
allowed to see Aung San Suu Kyi, a reliable source said. She 
had previously had contact only with immediate family members or 
security officials at her heavily-guarded lakeside home on the 
outskirts of Rangoon. 
  The meeting was apparently filmed, as a crew from Burmese 
state television was seen entering the premises at around 9 a.m. 
  Richardson, who arrived in Rangoon Sunday at the invitation 
of the ruling military junta, the State Law and Order 
Coordination Council (SLORC), is a member of the Congressional 
committee monitoring human rights under the Helsinki agreement.

  [Text] Malaysia today called on the United Nations to find 
a fair and comprehensive solution to the conflict in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina. It must solve the conflict in a comprehensive 
manner rather than merely rescuing Sarajevo, which is only part 
of the conflict. Speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur today, 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the United Nations 
must find a fair, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the 
conflict. It must also lift the arms embargo against Bosnia to 
enable Bosnian people to defend themselves. 
  The minister was commenting on an upcoming UN Security 
Council meeting on Bosnia, scheduled for this week. He 
described the NATO threat to launch air strikes against Serbian 
positions as a positive step. Sarajevo is not the only target 
of continued bombardments by Serbian terrorists; other cities 
are also under similar attack. Bosnia-Herzegovina is no longer a 
minor case for Europe, but an international issue involving 
human rights, democracy, and the right to exist as a sovereign 
state.

<F P=106> ["If U.S. Is Willing To Have Dialogue, It Must Stop Pressure </F>
Campaign Against DPRK, Declares DPRK FM Spokesman"--KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA)--If the United States 
is truly willing to have a dialogue, it must prove this by 
action and it must, first of all, stop the present pressure 
campaign against the DPRK, declared a spokesman of the Foreign 
Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  Answering today a question of KCNA on the present situation 
surrounding the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, the 
spokesman said there is no change in our stand of resolving the 
nuclear issue through dialogue. 
  He noted that if the United States really want to resolve 
the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it should no longer seek 
to isolate and stifle the DPRK with a double-dealing tactics as 
now but clearly indicate its correct stand toward the talks 
first of all. 
  Recalling that on January 31 we published a statement 
clarifying our principled stand toward the great difficulties 
laid in the solution of the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula by the unjustifiable act of the United States, he said: 
  The United States openly defended the secretariat of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which was demanding 
that we accept an unjust inspection tantamount to a 
comprehensive inspection, contrary to the points of agreement 
between the the DPRK and the U.S. and U.S. political figures 
went off into an undisguised war hysterics against us. 
  All this was clear manifestation of the policy of stifling 
the DPRK. 
  When the United States and the IAEA secretariat were 
resorting to base intrigues to stifle our Republic, openly 
reversing the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement like this, we 
could no longer pin hope on the DPRK-U.S. talks and, 
accordingly, made a resolute decision to walk our own way, not 
bound to any promise. 
  This decision of ours was immediately conveyed to the U.S. 
side through a relevant channel. 
  In this regard the U.S. side made clear that the inspection 
by the IAEA should be one purely for the continuity of 
safeguards and officially notified our side that there was no 
change in its stand to continue DPRK-U.S. talks and it was 
willing to discuss the nuclear issue and the improvement of the 
relations between the DPRK and the U.S. as a whole at the third 
round of talks. 
  Synchronizing with this, the secretariat of the IAEA 
suggested that it would seek an inspection only for the 
continuity of safeguards, renouncing its absurd former claim for 
a comprehensive inspection. 
  It is a fortunate thing, if the United States and the 
secretariat of the IAEA mean what they say. 
  However, the clamor for pressure on the DPRK continuously 
raised by the U.S. hardline conservatives makes us deeply doubt 
whether this stand of the United States is true, or not. 
  The U.S. Senate reportedly passed a "resolution on 
sanctions" 
against the DPRK some time ago and then the U.S. ambassador in 
the United Nations called a consultative meeting of the 
permanent members of the UN Security Council and discussed the 
feasibility of the "sanctions". 
  The United States and the South Korean authorities are even 
showing an undisguised movement to stage the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises. It obviously contradicts the stand for 
continued talks for the United States to resort to such row of 
pressure before the end of the negotiations for defining the 
scope of inspection for the continuity of safeguards between the 
DPRK and the IAEA Secretariat. 
  If the United States thinks it can get something by 
frightening us with strength, regarding pressure as an almighty 
solution, it is a mistake. 
  The heavier the pressure on us, the firmer our 
determination. 
  We will watch the future action of the United States with 
concern.

  [Text] In response to a question on the present situation 
surrounding the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula asked by a 
Korean Central News Agency reporter, a DPRK Foreign Ministry 
spokesman gave the following answer: 
  As everyone knows, on 31 January, we published a statement 
clarifying our principled stand toward the great difficulties 
laid in the solution of the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula by the unjustifiable act [pudanghan haengwi] of the 
United States. 
  Contrary to the agreement between the DPRK and the United 
States, the United States openly defended the Secretariat of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], which demands that we 
accept an unjust inspection tantamount to full-scope inspection 
[chonmyon sachal], and U.S. political figures went off into 
undisguised war hysterics [nogol chogin chonjaeng kwangjung] 
against us. 
  All this was a clear manifestation of the policy of crushing 
[apsal] the Republic. 
  When the United States and the IAEA Secretariat were 
resorting to base intrigues to crush [apsal] our Republic, 
openly reversing the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement like 
this, we could no longer pin hope on the DPRK-U.S. talks and, 
accordingly, made a resolute decision to walk our own way 
[chegalkillo nagalsupake optanun tanhohan kyolsimul naerige], 
not bound to any promise. 
  This decision of ours was immediately conveyed to the U.S. 
side through a relevant channel. 
  In this regard the U.S. side made clear that the inspection 
by the IAEA should be one purely for the continuity of 
safeguards [sunsu tamboui yonsoksong pojangul wihan sachallo] 
and officially notified our side that there was no change in its 
position to continue DPRK-U.S. talks and that it was willing to 
discuss the nuclear issue and the improvement of the relations 
between the DPRK and the United States as a whole if the third 
round of talks were held. 
  Timed to coincide with this, the IAEA Secretariat suggested 
[sisa] that it would renounce its absurd former claim for full- 
scope inspection and seek an inspection purely for the 
continuity of safeguards. 
  It is a fortunate thing, if this position of the United 
States and the IAEA Secretariat were true. 
  However, the pressure commotions against the Republic, which 
the U.S. hard-line conservatives are continuously kicking up, 
make us deeply doubt whether this position of the United States 
is true or not. 
  The U.S. Senate reportedly passed a resolution on sanctions 
against us some time ago, and the U.S. representative [taepyo] 
in the United Nations reportedly convened a consultative meeting 
of the permanent members of the UN Security Council and 
discussed the feasibility of the sanctions. 
  The United States and the South Korean authorities are even 
showing an undisguised movement to stage the Team Spirit joint 
military exercises. The United States resorts to such pressure 
commotions even before the end of the negotiations between the 
DPRK and the IAEA Secretariat for defining the scope of 
inspection for the continuity of safeguards. This obviously 
contradicts [myongbaekhui mosundoenda] a position to continue 
talks. 
  If the United States is truly willing to have a dialogue, it 
must prove this by action and it must, first of all, stop the 
present pressure commotions against the Republic. 
  Our position to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue 
has not changed. 
  If the United States really wants to resolve the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula, it should no longer seek to 
isolate and crush [korip apsal] us with double-dealing tactics 
as now but clearly indicate its correct position toward the 
talks first of all. 
  If the United States thinks it can get something by 
frightening us with strength, regarding pressure as an almighty

  We will watch the future action of the United States with

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Feb 12 (AFP) -- Taiwanese President Li 
Teng-hui and Indonesian President Suharto discussed economic 
relations between the two countries, which have no diplomatic 
ties, a newspaper here said Saturday. The daily JAKARTA POST 
said that Taiwanese Presidential Office spokesman Kramer Ting 
told journalists that Li and Suharto agreed that Indonesia and 
Taiwan should improve economic cooperation. 
  Suharto also expressed appreciation for Taiwanese investment 
in Indonesia, the spokesman said. The two presidents met for 90 
minutes at the Tampaksiring summer palace on the Indonesian 
resort island of Bali Friday. Despite the absence of diplomatic 
relations, Taiwan is the third largest investor in Indonesia, 
committing nearly four billion dollars over the past 25 years in 
the archipelago. Two-way trade was 1.42 billion dollars in the 
first half of 1993 and was a total of 2.62 billion dollars in 
1992. 
  The tightly guarded and closed meeting between Li and 
Suharto 
took place after a lunch attended by the presidents and the 
first ladies, a source here said. [passage omitted] 
  Suharto arrived in Bali late Thursday, officially to visit 
the newly renovated state-owned Grand Bali Beach Hotel, which 
had burned down in January 1992. [passage omitted] 
  Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said that Li's visit 
would not change Indonesia's One-China policy. He said that any 
meeting between Li and Indonesian officials, including Suharto, 
would be private capacities and should not be "exaggerated."

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- Japan's Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata resumed talks with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor in the early hours Friday [11 
February] in a bid to break the deadlock in the so-called 
framework trade talks ahead of Friday's U.S.-Japan summit. 
  Japanese officials said Hata left Blair House shortly before 
1 A.M. for his third encounter with Kantor since Thursday 
morning. 
  "There is always room for mutual concessions," Hata told 
reporters as he showed up at Kantor's office for the meeting. 
  The sticking point centers on a dispute over how to set 
"objective criteria" to measure imports into Japan. 
  Japanese officials say the United States insists on 
interpreting "objective criteria" as numerical yardsticks. 
  "Without objective criteria, we can't have a good 
agreement," 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was quoted as telling 
Hata in a meeting Thursday evening. 
  Senior administration officials have warned that President 
Clinton has made it clear he would rather have no agreement than 
"a bad agreement" by papering over differences. 
  Officials from Japan and the United States have only until 
11:30 A.M. to close an agreement. Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa is scheduled to meet with Clinton at that hour.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Lao </F>
People's Democratic Republic on an assessment of the 
implementation for 1993-94 of the Lao-U.S. cooperation plan for 
American prisoners of war and personnel missing in action -- 
read by announcer; date not given] 
  [Text] According to a report of the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry, the Voice of America -- an official mouthpiece of the 
U.S. State Department -- carried reports on 2 January and again 
on 13 January blaming the Lao side for failing to provide 
sufficient cooperation in excavating, surveying, and searching 
for American pilots missing in action during the war in Laos, 
the war for which the U.S. official sector has never admitted 
that it employed various types of aircraft to drop three-all 
[kill all, burn all, and destroy all] destructive bombs on Lao 
territory and that the bombardments took many lives, destroyed 
considerable property, and left extensive damage to the 
environment. After the end of the war, instead of paying 
compensation to the Lao side for the losses deliberately caused 
by the air bombardments, the U.S. side even pressed Laos and 
Vietnam, which are still suffering bruises from this war of 
aggression, to cooperate with it in searching for American 
pilots. These pilots flew planes shot down by the Lao and 
Vietnamese peoples while they were dropping bombs on a large 
scale to mercilessly kill these people. 
  Though the innocent Lao people still strongly resent the 
U.S. 
bombing, the government, as well as the ill-fated Lao people, 
have consistently agreed to cooperate well with the U.S. side in 
surveying, excavating, searching, and investigating the fates of 
these airborne pirates, despite the fact that the ill-fated Lao 
people, who experienced the suffering, have not been given any 
compensation for the losses caused by that destructive war. The 
Lao Government and people have cooperated with the U.S. side 
because they consider the issue a humanitarian one and have 
taken into consideration the feelings of the American people, 
who have also suffered due to the policies and secret activities 
of their official sectors. 
  This cooperation, as has been mentioned many times, began in 
1985 and 1986, when Lao and American technical teams excavated 
crash sites in Paksong District, Champassak Province. From then 
until late September 1993, the two sides jointly conducted 
surveys and excavations on 35 occasions in 11 provinces. So 
far, the remains of some 51 American personnel missing in action 
have been discovered. The U.S. side, however, has never made any 
announcements or remarks publicly acknowledging this. It is not 
known why the deputy head of the Congress of the United States, 
[title as heard] known as the person in charge of following up 
and expediting this issue and who has apparently known all about 
Lao cooperation from the beginning, has not mentioned anything 
about it. He has only said unconstructively that Laos has not 
cooperated, and that as Laos has failed to cooperate, it is 
necessary to put ever more pressure on Laos to do so. 
  To clear up the false accusations of the Voice of America 
and 
of the spokesman of the U.S. State Department and to enable 
peace- and justice-loving people throughout the world determine 
themselves what is true, what is false, who is right, and who is 
wrong in connection with this issue, the Lao side deems it 
necessary to clarify and give the following details about Lao 
cooperation, particularly in 1993 and 1994 -- from October 1993 
until February 1994 -- by reviewing the reports of Lao officials 
in charge of this issue: 
  The Lao-American cooperation project on American prisoners 
of 
war and personnel missing in wartime can be divided into the 
four following categories: 
  1. Surveys and excavations of areas around plane crashes. 
Based on the plan and data presented by the United States at the 
technical meeting held 16-17 September 1993, the U.S. proposed 
joint surveys and excavation of six crash sites in 10 provinces 
throughout the country, namely Attopeu, Sekong, Saravane, 
Savannakhet, Khammouane, Bolikhamsai, Vientiane, Houa Phan, 
Xieng Khouang, and Luang Prabang Provinces. These began in 
October 1993 and will end in late September 1994. From October 
1993 to February 1994, joint surveys and excavations were 
conducted on three occasions. 
  The surveys and excavations on the first occasion took 
place simultaneously in Sekong and Saravane Provinces. The work 
lasted 23 days -- from 19 October to 12 November 1993. It was 
performed jointly by 32 personnel from the U.S. side and seven 
from the Lao side, excluding local labor. Four helicopters were 
used. No motorcars were used, because all the sites are on 
mountains. There were 23 survey points and three excavation 
points. Eight personnel excavated at point 1530 where a C-130 
was shot down in 1968. A number of skeletons and teeth were 
discovered at that point. Ten personnel worked at point 1600 
where a C-130 was shot down in 1971. A number of skeletons and 
teeth were discovered there. Excavation was impossible at the 
third point, point 1382, because there were live bombs 
throughout the area. The excavation was suspended as hazardous 
to the personnel involved. Joint surveys were conducted on 23 
points of plane crashes. 
  The joint surveys and excavations in the second stage, 
called 
tripartite cooperation by the U.S. side -- Lao-U.S. and 
Vietnamese-U.S. cooperation -- were conducted along the 
Lao-Vietnamese border in Sekong, Saravane, and Savannakhet 
Provinces. Work was carried out in a radius of 10 km from each 
side of the borde, the radius which the U.S. side considered a 
privileged case based on the agreement reached by the deputy 
minister-level tripartite meeting held in Hawaii on 10 August 
1993. The second group of surveys and excavations took place 
over 16 days -- from 4 to 20 December 1993. A total of 32 from 
the U.S. side and seven from the Lao side, excluding auxiliary 
personnel, took part in these. Four helicopters and four motor 
vehicles were employed in the second stage. There were 17 survey 
points and three excavation points. At point 1643 a number of 
skeletons and teeth were discovered, while at points 1719 and 
1750, pilots' emblems and wreckage of downed aircraft were 
discovered. 
  During this second stage, tripartite technical meetings were 
held on four occasions at the Lao Bao border checkpoint to 
exchange information. The first meeting was on 4 December, the 
second on 6 December, the third on 10 December, and the fourth 
and last on 15 December 1993. In the final tripartite meeting 
at the Lao Bao border checkpoint on 15 December 1993, Winston 
Lord, deputy assistant to the U.S. secretary of state [title as 
heard], accompanied by Major General Thomas Needham, attended 
the meeting to observe the actual bilateral and tripartite 
cooperation. After the meeting, the two expressed thanks to the 
Lao Government for the fine cooperation that it has consistently 
given to the U.S. side. 
  The third stage of surveys and excavations was conducted in 
Savannakhet Province. It began on 12 January and ended on 8 
February 1994, lasting 28 days. Conducting the surveys and 
excavations were 32 personnel from the U.S. side and seven 
others from the Lao side, excluding supporting laborers. Four 
helicopters and four automobiles were employed. A camp was set 
up in Sepon District on Route 9. According to the plan proposed 
by the U.S. side, 26 points on crash sites were to be surveyed 
and six were to be excavated -- two in Vilabouli, two in Sepon, 
one in Phin, and another in Atsaphangthong Districts. As of 6 
February 1994, the surveys were completed on 17 points. 
Excavations at 0571 and 1363 have been completed. A number of 
teeth and skeletons were discovered. 
  At the time this report was prepared, an excavation was 
conducted at point 9950 in Na Gnom Canton, Vilabouli District, 
while preparations were being made for further excavation at 
point 0370. Excavations were conducted on many occasions at 
point 0018. The U.S. side has requested more excavations at 
this point, and the Lao side has had no objection. As the 
operation is still in progress, the achievements in conducting 
the surveys and excavations of the third stage can not be 
reviewed and assessed yet. 
  2. The second category of the Lao-U.S. cooperation project 
on this issue is the investigation and search for American POWs 
whom the U.S. side believes to be alive. To show its good 
intentions and sincerity to clear accusations from U.S. 
officialdom, which has claimed that there are still American 
POWs in Laos, despite the denials by the Lao side all along that 
no more such POWs remain and that there is no reason for the Lao 
side to keep them in Laos if there were any, the Lao side is 
willing to cooperate. If the U.S. side has concrete and 
reliable information on the living POWs, let the Lao side be 
informed so that a team can be set up to investigate. 
  In fact, in the recent past, the two sides have jointly 
investigated on many occasions. No facts concerning POWs have 
been found on any occasion. Examples were the case of Captain 
Borah, who was later found to be a 60-year-old Lao Theuang 
tribesman, namely (A-lao), and the case of First Lieutenant 
(Kha), whose photo was shown to the Lao side to assist with the 
search. According to American experts, the photo was believed to 
be a photo of 1st. Lt. (Kha). The Lao side, not expert in this 
field, said immediately after seeing the picture that the person 
is not an American and that the picture was not taken in Laos. 
The Lao side saw the picture as taken in a zoo in Thailand. 
Some one month later, it was determined that it is not a 
picture of 1st. Lt. (Kha). It is instead a picture of a German 
national, named Gunther, who runs a small business in Thailand. 
  Later, on 2 and 4 November 1993, the Lao side took (Gary 
Smith), an American expert in this field, to Toumlan village in 
Saravane Province. According to U.S. news sources, an American 
national was found living in the village. The news was received 
from a Thai trader working in the province. After an 
investigation, the person was found to be a physician attached 
to Medecins Sans Frontieres, which implemented an aid project in 
Laos. Later, on 25 and 28 January 1994, the Lao side also took 
(Gary Smith) to Nong Ma Village and Gnommalat District in 
Khammouane province to further investigate information he 
received about the detention of Americans at the two places. To 
make sure, our side granted special permission for him to 
inspect the Gnommalat prison and interrogate prisoners and 
people in nearby areas on whatever he wanted to know. But, he 
found no Americans living in the area. A bad point was that 
while inspecting the Gnommalat prison, instead of inquiring 
about the trail of the Americans, the American technician asked 
why the Lao nationals were detained there. Can this be seen as 
coming to find fault with the host country, which has cooperated 
with the U.S. side? 
  3. Interviews of prominent persons: At U.S. suggestion, the 
Lao side has allowed the U.S. to interview Sot Phetlasi in 
Vientiane twice. The second time was on 8 January 1994. The 
U.S. was also allowed to interview Lieutenant Colonel Khamla 
Keophithoun in Beijing, China, on 19 December 1993. 
  4. Probing various war documents and films: In response to 
a U.S. suggestion, the Lao allowed American experts to examine 
and list available films on 10 January 1994. This project is 
expected continue for the rest of the year. In addition, on 26 
January 1994, the Lao also granted permission for the U.S. to 
inspect the revolutionary museum in Vientiane. 
  In general, the Lao Government and people, as well as local 
administrations and concerned authorities at all levels of the 
Lao side, have cooperated well with the U.S. all along in 
dealing with the problem of American POW-MIAs. According to an 
agreement reached between the two sides, since August 1987 the 
U.S. Government has given assurance to the Lao side that in 
return for good cooperation, the U.S. will provide appropriate 
humanitarian aid to the Lao people. Based on said agreement, 
the Lao side has, therefore, requested said humanitarian aid 
from the U.S. for 1993-94. The request, in terms of medicine, 
small medical equipment, water pumps, generators, and 
motorcycles for local cadres working in support of the project, 
was made at the technical meeting held in Vientiane on 16-17 
September 1993. 
  So far, the Lao side has not yet received any aid from the 
U.S., while the surveys, excavations, collection of information 
about American POWs believed to be still alive, interviews, and 
the probing of films and documents has been done continuously 
each and every week and every month to the extent that there is 
almost no time for rest. What does the U.S. want the Lao to do 
so as to be seen as cooperating sufficiently? If Lao 
cooperation given fails to meet U.S. requirements, would it be 
better for us to stop wasting time continuing to do it?

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States have agreed to carry on efforts to resolve the 
North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue, South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said in Washington on Thursday. 
"Our two countries decided to exert all available efforts to 
settle the nuclear question through dialogue until the regular 
Board of Governors' meeting of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) opens (on Feb. 21)," Han said. 
  He made the remarks to reporters at the Watergate Hotel 
following talks with U.S. Vice President Al Gore and National 
Security Adviser Anthony Lake at the White House. 
  "It is true there are some hard-line voices in the United 
States with respect to the nuclear question," said Han. "But, 
the United States' official policy direction now is to carry on 
with dialogue." 
  The two countries, Han said, also shared views on the 
importance of maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula, even 
though the peninsula is not in a state of crisis now. 
  Discussing recent efforts by the five permanent members of 
the U.N. Security Council to adopt a statement on North Korea, 
Minister Han said dialogue was discussed as part of its policy 
on the North Korean nuclear question. "The five countries can 
pool their opinions for conveyance to North Korea," he said. 
  Han said that if the nuclear question were referred to the 
U.N. Security Council, it would choose one of two available 
options. The first is to begin with a resolution on North Korea, 
followed by weak sanctions initially and stronger steps later: 
The second is to impose sanctions from the start after a 
certain period of time passes. 
  Regarding China's future role, Han said its behavior at the 
Security Council depends on how far "we have striven to resolve 
the question peacefully." 
  "Substantial achievements have been made between Seoul and 
Beijing through direct discussions and cooperation. I believe 
China will continue to try to settle the question peacefully in 
what they think is the best manner," the minister said. 
  On the possibility of the United States and North Korea 
resuming contacts in New York, Han said there are no plans to do 
so at the moment. He was quick to add, however, that "we think 
it is better to have an exchange of opinions in whatever form." 
  Minister Han is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry on Friday 
afternoon to discuss the nuclear question. The talks will be 
preceded by an earlier meeting between Han and Assistant 
Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of State Tom Hubbard and several other senior State Department 
officials.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States agreed Friday that they will continue efforts to 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue before 
referring it to the U.N. Security Council. The agreement came 
during a meeting between South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the 
State Department on Friday afternoon. 
  At the hour-long meeting, Han and Christopher shared the 
opinion that Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency could still make progress in negotiations on IAEA 
inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, according to 
Chang Chae-yong, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's 
American affairs Bureau. 
  In addition, Han and Christopher agreed that even if the 
North Korean issue was referred to the Security Council, U.N. 
action against Pyongyang should be taken in stages rather than 
through immediate sanctions. 
  They reportedly decided to introduce mild measures at first, 
such as passing a resolution urging North Korea to accept IAEA 
inspections, before gradually turning up the heat, Foreign 
Ministry sources said. 
  Han also handed Christopher a personal letter from President 
Kim Yong-sam to U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  In the letter, President Kim reaffirmed the agreements he 
and 
Clinton reached at their summit in Washington last November and 
in a telephone conversation on Dec. 7, in which they vowed to 
pursue "thorough and wide-ranging" measures to resolve the North 
Korean nuclear problem. 
  Earlier Friday morning, Han met with new U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry and agreed to study plans to hold the 
joint military exercise "Team Spirit," tentatively scheduled for 
March 10, if North Korea refuses to allow inspection of its 
nuclear facilities. 
  Han told Perry that South Korea was positively considering 
the proposed deployment by U.S. forces in Korea of Patriot 
missiles, but he urged the United States to be careful about the 
timing, sources said. 
  The two officials further agreed that the current situation 
on the Korean peninsula could not be termed a crisis. 
Nevertheless, Seoul and Washington would make thorough 
preparations to preserve South Korea's security against any 
military provocation by North Korea. 
  Prior to meeting with Christopher, Han held wide-ranging 
discussions with senior officials of the U.S. State Department 
including Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for 
political and military affairs, and Tom Hubbard, deputy 
assistant secretary of state. 
  The two sides agreed that they will not abandon their 
efforts 
to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue 
before Feb. 21, when the IAEA Board of Governors is scheduled 
to meet. 
  In addition, they decided to study the possibility of 
holding 
a working-level contact in New York between the United States 
and North Korea in the belief that Pyongyang must be told of 
"the hard- line atmosphere" in the international community on 
the nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Kyo-kwan] </F>
  [Text] Korean businesses are stepping up their investment 
in North America to adapt to changes in the region's business 
environment following the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA), which went into effect Jan. 1. Particularly, Korean 
manufacturers of electronic appliances and autos are hurrying to 
set up locally incorporated plants in the region to meet the 
strengthened regulations for country of origin clause in the 
free trade agreement. The implementation of NAFTA is expected 
to affect Korean exports of electronic goods, autos and fabrics 
as the regulations for country of origin under the agreement 
have been toughened, business officials said. 
  For example, the new country of origin rules require 
exporters of color TV sets to the region to use locally produced 
color picture tubes (CPTs) for 14-inch or bigger sets if they 
want to enjoy tariff exemption. 
  In addition, the agreement demands that exporters of 
passenger cars, light trucks, engines and transmissions increase 
their use of locally produced parts from the present 50 percent 
to 62.5 percent by 2002 to gain tariff exemption. 
  Accordingly, trade officials here have urged Korean 
companies 
to establish locally incorporated production factories in the 
NAFTA region as soon as possible to stave off these 
"protectionist" measures. 
  Goldstar Co., one of the leading electronics manufacturers 
in 
the nation, will expand the annual production capability of its 
Mexican plant, GSMX, from the current 700,000 color TV sets to 1 
million by investing $10 million, a company official said. To 
meet the country of origin regulations of the NAFTA countries, 
the electronics arm of the Lucky-Goldstar Business Group is 
groping for ways to enter the region along with two electronic 
parts makers, he said. 
  In a bid to expand its sales of electronic goods in the U.S. 
market, Goldstar has been restructuring its locally incorporated 
sales company, Goldstar Electronics International Inc., since 
1991, the official said. 
  "Through the revamped sales network, we expect our exports 
to 
the big U.S. market to rise continually. After-sale services on 
Goldstar-made products also will be strengthened across the 
United States," he said. 
  The company also is planning to set up a $100-million 
joint-venture factory to churn out TV cathode-ray tubes in 
Mexico with Samsung Electron Devices Co. and Orion Electronics 
Co., business sources said. TV cathode-ray tubes to be produced 
by the proposed Mexican plant could be used in color TVs 
produced by Samsung Electronics Co., Goldstar Co. and Daewoo 
Electronics Co., all of which hope to expand their market share 
in the United States, they said. 
  Samsung Electronics Co., the electronics arm of the Samsung 
Business Group, is expanding the annual production capability of 
its Mexican plant, SAMEX, from the current 1 million color TV 
sets to 1.2 million, a company spokesman said. To satisfy the 
local regulations for country of origin, the company has helped 
its Korean parts makers set up their own plants in Mexico, and 
the partners are now supplying SAMEX with main TV parts, he said. 
  Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co. is studying a plan to 
establish 
a wholly owned plant to produce TV tuners and speakers in 
Tihuanisi, Mexico, which is close to the border with the United 
States, at a cost of $40 million, a company official said. 
  Korean automakers have been reluctant to set up locally 
incorporated plants in North America as the tariffs which the 
United States levies on imported autos are still low, business 
officials said. Recently, however, large Korean automakers 
including Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo have begun considering 
establishing production plants in the North American region now 
that NAFTA has taken effect, they said. 
  According to the officials, such proposed, locally 
incorporated auto plants will also help the automakers expand 
their exports to South American nations, which are growing 
rapidly following radical economic reforms. 
  Particularly, Hyundai Motor Co., the auto arm of the Hyundai 
Group, has already begun expanding its Canadian plant so that it 
can churn out 100,000 subcompact car Elantras annually from 
1995, a company official said.

  [Text] According to a VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY reporter based in 
New York, at 1700 local time [2200 GMT] on 3 February -- or 0500 
Hanoi time on 4 February -- at the White House in the capital 
city of Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced his 
decision to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam and open a 
United States liaison office in Hanoi. 
  He said: Today I am lifting the trade embargo against 
Vietnam, because I am absolutely convinced that it offers the 
best way to resolve the fate of those who remain missing and 
unaccounted for. 
  The President reviewed U.S. efforts to search for missing 
American servicemen and stressed that efforts will continue to 
obtain more information about American servicemen who are 
prisoners or who are missing. He also announced that a United 
State liaison office will be set up in Vietnam to provide 
services to Americans in Vietnam and help follow up on human 
rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government. 
  President Clinton also said that the decision does not 
involve the normalization of relations: Before that happens, we 
must have more progress and cooperation; more answers. In this 
regard, he will send another high-ranking delegation to Vietnam 
to search for additional human remains and documents. 
  Secretary of State Christopher; Secretary of Defense Aspin; 
Joint Chiefs Chairman Shalikashvili; and many other high-ranking 
officials and senators, including Mr. John Kerry, were among 
those who attended the conference.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam has 
issued a statement on the U.S. President's decision to lift the 
trade embargo on Vietnam. The statement said: 
  On 3 February 1994, President Bill Clinton declared the 
lifting of the embargo on Vietnam and proposed the mutual 
establishment of liaison offices in the two countries. This is 
a positive and significant decision which contributes to opening 
a new page in the U.S.-Vietnam relations in the interests of the 
two peoples. This decision meets the desire of the American and 
Vietnamese peoples as well as of many other countries. It is in 
line with the trend toward peace, development in Asia-Pacific, 
and in the world. The improvement in U.S.-Vietnam relations 
will make a significant contribution to the common endeavor of 
the countries of the world for the sake of peace, friendship, 
and cooperation among nations. 
  The Government and people of Vietnam welcome this decision 
of 
the American Government. On this occasion, the Vietnamese 
Government affirms its policy whereby it consistently attaches 
importance to relations with the United States and wishes for 
normal relations between the two countries on the basis of 
respect for each other's independence and sovereignty, 
noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality, and 
mutual benefit. Proceeding from such a position, Vietnam will 
continue to cooperate fully with the American Government and 
people in solving pending issues between the two countries. 
  Vietnam accepts the establishment of liaison offices in the 
respective capitals to be seen as a transitional step toward 
full diplomatic relations. 
  The Vietnamese Government reiterates its policy of 
consistently regarding the question of Americans missing from 
the war and the humanitarian concerns not linked with political 
issues. 
  In consonance with the human traditions and policies, the 
Government and people of Vietnam have been, are, and will be 
cooperating in the constructive spirit with the American 
Government and people to solve this issue to the fullest 
possible extent. 
  On this occasion, the Vietnamese Government and people 
express their sincere gratitude to all those who in the United 
States and other countries of the world have made their 
contributions to the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam and to 
the improvement of relations between the United States and 
Vietnam. The Government and people of Vietnam once again affirm 
the policy of befriending all countries in the world community 
for the sake of peace, stability, and development in Southeast 
Asia and the world over.

  [Excerpts] Dear friends: The Vietnamee Foreign Ministry 
held a news conference in Hanoi this afternoon on U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's decision to lift the trade embargo against 
Vietnam and to open a U.S. liaison office in Hanoi. 
  The news conference was presided over by Deputy Foreign 
Minister Le Mai and was attended by a large number of local and 
foreign news reporters. The news conference started with the 
deputy foreign minister reading the Foreign Ministry statement 
on the U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo against 
Vietnam. The statement reads in full as follows: 
  On behalf of the Foreign Ministry, I would like to 
announce the statement of the SRV Foreign Ministry regarding the 
U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo against 
Vietnam. [passage omitted on Le Mai reading the Foreign 
Ministry statement published above] 
  This is followed by a question and answer session. 
  An Australian Radio and Television Company reporter asked: 
When did the Vietnamese Government receive the report on the 
U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo and by what 
means? And was this decision made by President Bill Clinton or 
the U.S. Government? 
  Deputy Prime Minister Le Mai answered: According to 
U.S. law, the right to lift the embargo rests with the 
president. As for when we were informed of this, I can say that 
we have been widely informed by friends from various countries 
and through different means. I am using the word friends here 
to refer to newsmen. And before President Clinton's decision 
was announced, our [UN] ambassador in New York had met with U.S. 
State Department officials who had informed him of the action. 
He telephoned me about this matter before 0500 this morning, 
that is, before the presidential announcement. 
  A Japanese ASAHI reporter asked about the plan to establish 
the U.S. liaison office in Hanoi and about when the 
establishment of diplomatic offices will be planned. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said: The U.S. and 
Vietnamese Governments will have a meeting to exchange views on 
stipulations governing the number of diplomatic cadres and 
members of the diplomatic corps as well as on the operating 
procedures for these liaison offices. I do not think that these 
are difficult issues. Therefore, the exchange of liaison offices 
between the two governments will be undertaken soon. 
  A BANGKOK POST reporter asked: What are the follow-up steps 
after the U.S. presidential announcement on lifting the embargo 
against Vietnam and what are the most important issues? 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said: What we have been 
longing for and will continue to long for is to have the United 
States regard Vietnam as a friend. Our Vietnamese people will 
also regard the American people as friends. 
  The deputy foreign minister also answered many questions 
raised by Vietnamese and foreign reporters on the MIA issue, on 
the question of frozen assets of the two sides, and on the 
relations between Vietnam and other ASEAN countries following 
the lifting of the embargo. 
  A FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW reporter asked: Rumor has it 
that Vietnam will give priority to U.S. businessmen to engage in 
a number of investment projects such as those involving oil and 
gas exploitation. Is this true? 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai answered: We welcome 
U.S. businessmen coming to do business in Vietnam, to contribute 
to economic cooperation, and to spur economic development in 
Vietnam in the interests of the two countries. The Vietnamese 
Government hereby assures U.S. businessmen that the Vietnamese 
Government will create equal opportunities for U.S. businessmen 
to compete with those from other countries already in Vietnam. 
Tradition does not allow us to give preferential treatment to 
one country without giving the same treatment to others. I 
think that with its technology and its economic strengths, the 
United States will be able to develop its competitive power if 
it enjoys equal opportunities.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Detente Reaches Vietnam"] </F>
  [Text] As U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen recently 
put it, economic policy is an increasingly important component 
of the U.S. foreign policy. This is so because President 
Clinton is determined that his country should resume the role of 
the driving force of the world economy. To achieve this, 
Clinton must defend U.S. companies and create new jobs in 
industry and agriculture. Much of the president's effort has 
been geared to the approval of NAFTA; to the holding of the 
Asia-Pacific Conference in Seattle; to the successful conclusion 
of the Uruguay Round of the GATT -- which will enable the United 
States to sell its agricultural surpluses for several years 
while restructuring the sector and being instrumental in 
improving competitiveness all over the world; to pressuring 
Japan, the PRC, the ROK, and other countries to improve the U.S. 
balance of trade position; and so on and so forth. The lifting 
on the embargo on trade with Vietnam is another chapter in this 
long string of events. 
  The initiative is neither surprising nor does it stem from 
Clinton's past convictions about the Vietnam War, even though 
public opinion believes his action is undoubtedly tinged by 
memories and emotions of that cruel war -- without mentioning 
the "missing" U.S. soldiers whose whereabouts have never been 
disclosed by the Hanoi authorities. They have not repatriated 
the mortal remains of all the fallen to their homeland either. 
  And yet, bilateral relations have eased off considerably. 
Back in April 1991, General John Vessey, an envoy of the then 
President George Bush, met with the Vietnamese foreign minister 
to notify him of the opening of an official U.S. office to 
investigate the fate of the U.S. soldiers reported as missing. 
They also discussed the possible resumption of diplomatic 
relations on condition Vietnam withdrew its troops from 
Cambodia, and that the South Vietnamese officers being held in 
"rehabilitation camps" be released and authorized to travel to 
the United States. It goes without saying that the United 
States also made it a condition that Vietnam should actively 
cooperate in the search of the missing. In exchange for that, 
rapprochement would continue (telecommunications, tourism) and 
restrictions imposed on Vietnamese diplomats before the United 
Nation in New York would be lifted. 
  Following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia 
in mid December 1992 and Vietnamese cooperation over the 
missing, Washington authorized U.S. companies to "prepare 
themselves" in Vietnam because the raising of the embargo was 
considered imminent. Washington also gave the "green light" for 
international credits for Vietnam for the reconstruction of the 
country. 
  Following a line of diplomatic continuity at the beginning 
of 
July 1993, President Clinton announced that the United States 
would no longer oppose the granting of loans for Hanoi by 
international organizations (the IMF and the World Bank). By 
that time, the economic reform in Vietnam had attracted 
significant foreign investments, mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong, 
Japan, and Europe. 
  Finally, Washington sent three consular affairs experts to 
Hanoi in July 1993 to look after fellow citizens who travelled 
to Vietnam in ever-increasing numbers. By this time the 
Vietnamese had "found" the blue book where the names of all the 
U.S. prisoners of war were recorded and submitted the list to 
Gen. Vessey. This report agreed more with the documents 
obtained from Soviet archives than with the original list 
drafted by Hanoi. 
  Parallel to the progress on the missing was the 
consideration 
that, from a very modest start, Vietnam's economy was growing 
in leaps and bounds. It grew by 7.5 percent in 1992, and in 
1993 things looked even better (industrial production increased 
by 12.3 percent in nine months in 1993). Exports were expanding 
at an average 20 percent a year. Foreign investments for the 
period 1988 to August 1993 totalled $6.300 billion. This 
contrasts sharply with the constraints on U.S. companies that 
could only participate in business transactions with Vietnam 
through contracts with international organizations. 
  Thus U.S. businessmen as well as the Senate enthusiastically 
hailed the lifting of the trade embargo. U.S. companies, ready 
and eager like racehorses at the starting gate, began activities 
without wasting a minute, as has been eloquently recorded by 
newspapers over the last few days. The logic of business 
prevailed over [former President Richard] Nixon-like ideologies 
which were furthered by those who want to continue struggling 
against the last pockets of "the empire of the evil" until it is 
totally routed, or at least until it is smothered. The 
reestablishment of full diplomatic relations will have to wait 
until the issue of the missing is totally cleared up. 
  The United States created 62,000 new jobs in January, 26,000 
of which are in the industrial sector. It thus keeps reducing 
its unemployment rate, which runs at approximately 6.4 percent. 
This is much lower than the average in the European Union (10.9 
percent), but higher than that of Germany, which is currently 6 
percent. This is the reason why Clinton continues his trade 
offensive -- to expand exports and reduce imports -- as the 
basis for the country's productive renewal. He is aware that in 
our modern world, nobody can indulge in the luxury of giving up 
one's domestic market or a highly remunerative job lest one 
should plunge into the maelstrom of decadence.

  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says 
everyone will benefit from the lifting of America's embargo on 
Vietnam. Senator Evans says Australia has been pushing 
President Clinton and his administration on the issue: 
  [Begin Evans recording] We have been urging him and previous 
administrations to go down this route, of course, for a very 
long time. We have regarded it as, quite frankly, absurd that 
the POW-MIA issue should have occupied the time and attention 
and been the distraction that it was. Obviously it is in 
everyone's interest that there be a resumption of major economic 
activity in Vietnam, and we are very glad that has happened. 
[end recording] 
  Sen. Evans said Australian industry should not fear American 
competition in Vietnam, because it should generate higher 
economic activity. The foreign minister said Australian 
industry was much more internationally competitive and Australia 
already had an established track record in Vietnam. 
  Belinda Tromp reports that the American decision is expected 
to remove some obstacles for Australian investors: 
  [Begin recording] [Tromp] With a literacy rate of around 80 
percent and a government keen to achieve rapid economic growth, 
Vietnam has some of the fundamentals for attracting new 
investment. What is missing, according to an executive member 
of the Australia-Vietnam Business Council, Robert Wilcox, is a 
modern bureaucracy. 
  [Wilcox] The Vietnamese need to move, I believe, more 
quickly 
with their reforms -- in getting their legal system together, 
getting their administrative act together -- as a result of this. 
  [Tromp] Mr. Wilcox says the reputation and expertise 
established by Australian companies already in Vietnam -- such 
as BHP, Telecom, and the ANZ Bank -- put Australian companies in 
a good position for the onset of competition from U.S. 
investors. [end recording]

  [Text] Australia has welcomed the U.S. decision to lift its 
embargo on Vietnam. A spokesperson for the foreign minister, 
Gareth Evans, said although the decision does not include the 
establishment of diplomatic relations, it is a positive step 
toward Vietnam's acceptance in the international community. The 
spokesperson says the increased competition which is likely to 
result between Australian and U.S. firms in Vietnam should also 
be welcomed.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Nathalie Mattheiem: "Washington Makes a </F>
Gesture Toward Hanoi"] 
  [Excerpts] Washington -- In lifting the U.S. trade embargo 
on Vietnam -- President Clinton has finally overcome the 
political, historical, and personal obstacles to the measure 
which business circles wanted. This was a decision made easier 
by the Senate's adoption, during a general foreign policy 
debate, of a recommendation that this should be done, supported 
in particular by veterans and former prisoners of war from both 
parties. 
  The President needed all the help he could get on this 
sensitive subject: The organizations representing families of 
soldiers reported "missing in action" (MIA's) during the Vietnam 
War reject this additional step toward the normalization of 
relations between the former enemies, with, in particular, the 
opening of American Government offices in Hanoi. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is therefore easy to understand that the President should 
start by expressing his conviction that his decision would make 
a full search possible: The progress in cooperation with 
Vietnam is tangible, he said, and the United States itself is 
devoting more effort to this question than at any other time in 
its history, the President said, citing the practical results 
obtained since he came to office. His decision was the result 
of careful consideration, he added, and was supported by all the 
experts inside and outside the White House: Vietnam's 
cooperation would be more effectively guaranteed by a policy of 
"involvement," but without going as far as "normalization," than 
by any continuation of the country's isolation. 
  Is this really the end of the famous "Vietnam syndrome?" 
Many 
people in the White House, the Capitol, and the country, hope 
so. It is not completely certain, as demonstrated by the 
hostility which the President encountered last year when he paid 
his respects at the "wall," the memorial to the people who died 
in that war. As the President himself admitted, a whole 
generation is obsessed by the desire to know what happened to 
the soldiers who never came back, after the last repatriation of 
prisoners under the Nixon administration. However, over the 
years, this feeling has gradually given way to the desire to "be 
reconciled" with the past. [passage omitted] 
  For American firms, the time to rush into this market, now 
described as "enormous," has certainly arrived: The big 
business lobby and oil companies at Westinghouse had been 
waiting impatiently for months. Forced to go through 
intermediaries, they saw their competitors, especially European 
competitors, establishing themselves and cleaning out this new 
country in which, they note in passing, 60 percent of the 
population was not born when the conflict was raging. The 
Democrats' new policy, aside from a less "automatic" link 
between humanitarian and commercial questions than campaign 
speeches suggested, is focused on economic recovery, and hence 
encouraging exports. Although President Clinton's personal 
position was bound to be extremely uncomfortable in this 
specific case, his decision is consistent with his priorities: 
To unite the country, and in particular to heal once and for 
all the emotional wounds of the Vietnam War, and to ensure 
economic recovery.

<F P=106> [From the "Notes and Information" page: "The End of the </F>
Vietnam Era"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Senate last week approved a resolution 
urging President Bill Clinton to normalize economic ties with 
Vietnam. The proposal was submitted by a Vietnam war veteran 
and prisoner of war, and supported by other senators who are 
also Vietnam war veterans. Because the resolution was a mere 
recommendation, it was believed that it would be merely another 
step in the process of normalizing U.S.-Vietnamese ties, which 
has been dragging since 1991. Extremely propitious conditions 
-- particularly the insignificant opposition of groups demanding 
the identification and location of those soldiers missing in 
action in Vietnam -- allowed President Bill Clinton a few days 
later to lift to commercial embargo in force for 19 years. 
  In fact, the timetable established by the Bush 
administration 
to normalize U.S.-Vietnamese diplomatic ties is being fulfilled. 
One year ago, Vietnamese authorities helped to locate those 
missing in action and as a result of the Vietnamese troops 
withdrawal, Cambodia was able to hold elections. Thus the 
international and domestic prerequisites the U.S. Government 
announced as essential for normalizing its ties with Vietnam 
were met. 
  The process was delayed because of the action of outspoken 
veteran groups, which have important electoral clout, that were 
dissatisfied with the almost insignificant progress to locate 
the almost 2,300 soldiers missing in action. One of the 
remaining myths of the war is that U.S. prisoners are still kept 
in concentration camps, which is like saying that the fictitious 
Rambo films are true. 
  Once the precautions of election year were left behind, 
reason and business prevailed. Vietnam is a rapidly growing 
market of 70 million people offering good business opportunities 
that were previously denied to U.S. manufacturers. The 
Vietnamese market grows 8 percent per year and the socialist 
rigors applied to the economy have almost been nonexistent since 
the end of the 1980's. These considerations weighed heavily on 
President Bill Clinton's decision. It is true that Clinton can 
only lift the embargo now that the painful "Vietnam drama" -- 
the feeling of self-inflicted defeat that undermined U.S. pride 
for two decades -- is already part of the past. 
  By allowing the normalization of business ties -- diplomatic 
ties will be restored shortly through which Vietnam will have a 
more favorable status which in turn will promote trade -- 
President Clinton ends a stage in history that enables the world 
to know the true limits of power and force and opens a stage of 
business cooperation that will benefit all involved nations.

  [Text] Another taboo of the modern world has collapsed with 
the end of the trade embargo imposed by the United States on 
Vietnam. After 19 years the embargo was maintained mainly for 
historical reasons. 
  Little remains of the differences that led the two countries 
to war in the 1960's and 1970's. Vietnam has withdrawn its 
troops from Cambodia. With a single party system, and without 
worrying about subjects like human rights, Vietnam has gradually 
opened its market to the rest of the world. 
  The truth is that Vietnam allowed itself to be contaminated 
by the winds of trade and prosperity that turned the Far East 
into the greatest laboratory of economic experiences at the turn 
of the century. To a certain extent the embargo created more 
distress for American companies than for the Vietnamese 
themselves. 
  In a country where everything literally had to be 
constructed 
or reconstructed, capital from Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, South 
Korea, and from the former colonial world power, France, among 
other European investors, poured in. 
  Melting the ice with the United States was more difficult, 
but it began in the mid-1980's when the Americans were still 
grieving over the humiliation of the military defeat. 
Curiously, there were not as many difficulties on the 
Vietnamese side. The economic reforms thus gained momentum in 
1986. Given the events in the USSR, the failure of Communism 
contrasted with the bewildering acceleration of the market 
economies in the neighboring countries. 
  U.S. goodwill, which Vietnam needed to gain access to 
international capital, was generated through a cooperative 
attitude over a subject that touched the heart of the Americans: 
The location of the prisoners of war whose whereabouts were 
unknown. Last year President Clinton withdrew the veto the 
United States imposed on help from international financial 
institutions. From then on, the embargo was psychological and 
political rather than economic. 
  We wonder when and how the same thing will happen with Cuba. 
The main objective of that embargo was to combat Communist 
infiltration in the continent and in the direct area of 
influence of the United States. 
  That motive no longer exists. The Cuban Government is in 
tatters and whenever they can, Cubans move from a government job 
to small private businesses. 
  Paradoxically the embargo is the only way Fidel Castro can 
still touch the nationalist feelings of the increasingly 
disillusioned Cubans. It is his last chance to carry the Cuban 
flag. 
  If the embargo were lifted it would be doubtful if the Cuban 
regime would survive the avalanche of opportunities that would 
be created by the arrival of capitalist agents, that is, 
development.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Vietnam: An Emerging Asian Tiger"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has decided to lift the 
economic blockade against Vietnam, which has been in force since 
the beginning of the U.S.-Vietnamese war in 1964. Justifying 
the decision, Clinton said this is the best way to determine the 
fate of some 2,238 Americans missing in Vietnam. He also cited 
Vietnam's return of the bodies of a number of U.S. soldiers. 
  Although the decision angered some organizations, especially 
Vietnam war veterans and families of American POW's, it is, in 
fact, a response to pressure by U.S. firms. A number of major 
U.S. firms realized that the embargo on Vietnam narrows their 
opportunities in this growing market. Still ruled by a 
communist government, Vietnam introduced an economic reform plan 
in 1989. Under the plan, Vietnam managed to grow from a 
rice-importing country to the world's second or third biggest 
rice exporter. Economic growth rose between 6 to 8 percent over 
the past four years, and the government managed to reduce 
inflation from 300 percent to only 15 percent, helping the 
influx of foreign investment. 
  But foreign investment is largely Asian, and Vietnam does 
most of its trade with other Asian countries. This stirred U.S. 
firms, which see in Vietnam an emerging Asian tiger with a huge 
market, a population of about 67 million, and cheap labor. 
Irrespective of all the justifications made by Clinton, the 
decision to lift the trade embargo on Vietnam was motivated by 
the interests of the major U.S. companies.

Government to lift its trade embargo on Vietnam. A Foreign 
Ministry press statement stated that, even though the embargo is 
a bilateral problem of the two countries, the United States 
Government's lifting of the embargo was heartening because this 
would stimulate trade and economic activities among the various 
nations. 
  Indonesia attaches great importance to efforts aimed at 
further enhancing regional political stability, security, and 
cooperation. As a result, any effort made to develop normal 
relations with any nation in this region represents a positive 
approach which will assist toward achieving such an aim.

  [Text] With the lifting of the 30-year U.S. trade sanctions 
against Vietnam, Washington's efforts for establishing a greater 
presence in the South Asian region has found new dimensions. 
  After the U.S. Senate approved a bill to lift trade 
sanctions 
against Vietnam, Bill Clinton officially announced the lifting 
of sanctions yesterday and thus the way was cleared for 
investment by U.S. companies and establishments in Vietnam. 
  According to agency reports, with the lifting of the 
sanctions at least 25 American firms that had offices in 
Vietnam, which up until now were prevented from extensive 
activity for political reasons, have started their work. The 
lifting of trade sanctions against Vietnam has taken place at 
the same time as the publication of reports in which its 
supporters in Washington spoke of the adverse effects of the 
continuation of those sanctions on the unhealthy U.S. economy. 
Moreover, that group supporters of the lifting of sanctions in 
Washington believe that by lifting the sanctions against 
Vietnam, Washington will be in a better position to access that 
country's market in international competition. 
  Before the lifting of the sanctions against Vietnam, 
Washington had set two preconditions for improving its relations 
with them. First was a clarification of the status of 1,500 
American soldiers who disappeared during the Vietnam war. The 
other was the speeding up of the trend of reforms that had 
started in 1985. But the new political and economic realities 
in Vietnam are such that America cannot give up a country that 
possesses rich oil and mineral resources, as well as the 
potential to absorb foreign investment and pull back from 
international competition, especially when Japan, France, and 
China, as well as other powerful European industrial states and 
East Asian regions, started their efforts some time ago to 
establish a serious presence in the reconstruction of that 
country and offering financial aid to Hanoi. 
  It is clear that the main obstacle in America's extensive 
presence in Vietnam is China's policy regarding Hanoi, something 
that has created concern in Washington. Those concerns stem 
from the fact that if China succeeds in gathering the small 
South Asian states -- that earlier were allied to the former 
Soviet Union -- around its own axis and prevent their strong 
leaning toward Western capitalism, that country's political 
success will be further strengthened in South Asia. Therefore, 
if the issue of lifting the trade sanctions against Vietnam is 
viewed from the angle of the formation of economic and 
commercial competition in South Asia, as well as China's policy 
regarding Hanoi, the trend of normalizing relations between 
Vietnam and America will be justifiable in the eyes of 
Washington's statesmen. Thus, it seems that Vietnam's future, 
from a political and economic point of view, will take the form 
of a competition framework between China and America.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Japan expressed hope Friday 
[4 February] that the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against 
Vietnam will contribute to peace and prosperity in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  "At last, spring came to U.S.-Vietnam relations," Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "I 
perceive it as a very hopeful development." 
  The top government spokesman also said, "I hope the improved 
ties between the two nations will not be restricted to them 
alone but contribute to the peace and prosperity in the broader 
Asia-Pacific region." 
  Takemura issued the comment shortly after U.S. President 
Bill 
Clinton announced he is lifting the 19-year-old embargo against 
Vietnam. 
  Clinton also said the United States and Vietnam have decided 
to exchange liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington to 
facilitate more progress on the missing Americans issue. 
  He removed the sanctions a week after the Senate voted 
overwhelmingly in favor of lifting the embargo in recognition of 
Vietnam's cooperation in accounting for the fate of 2,238 
Americans still listed as missing in Vietnam, and also in the 
hope that Hanoi will cooperate more on the issue. 
  The United States imposed an economic embargo on 
communist-ruled North Vietnam in 1964 and extended it to the 
whole country when the U.S.-backed regime in Saigon fell to 
communist forces in April 1975.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Japan welcomed Friday [4 
February] the United States announcement that it will lift its 
nearly two decades-long trade embargo against Vietnam which is 
expected to pave the way for normalization of Washington-Hanoi 
ties. 
  "Japan welcomes the decision made by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam as a 
significant step toward the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam 
relations," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada said. 
  Japan regards the U.S. decision as "contributing not only to 
the improvement of the U.S.-Vietnam relationship but also to the 
peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region," Terada said. 
  He said Japan has been making diplomatic efforts to 
facilitate the improvement of U.S.-Vietnam ties, such as urging 
Vietnamese Government officials to cooperate with the U.S. in 
resolving problems involving Americans Missing in Action (MIAs) 
in the Vietnam war. 
  Tokyo has also been telling the U.S. Government it is "very 
important to ameliorate" Washington-Hanoi ties, he said. 
  Clinton announced Thursday he would lift the 19-year-old 
trade embargo against Vietnam, citing "tangible progress" in the 
accounting of American MIAs. 
  He also said the U.S. and Vietnam have decided to exchange 
liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington to facilitate more 
progress on the MIA issue. 
  But Clinton said the measure does not constitute a 
normalization of diplomatic relations, saying, "before that 
happens, we must have more progress, more cooperation and more 
answers." 
  The U.S. imposed an economic embargo on communist-ruled 
North Vietnam in 1964 and extended it to the whole country when 
the U.S.-backed regime in Saigon fell to communist forces in 
April 1975.

<F P=106> [Article by Chin Se-kun: "The Background Behind the U.S. </F>
Lifting of Its Embargo on Vietnam--Choosing Material Gain in 
`Asia's Last Golden Market'"] 
  [Text] The United States entered the road to normalizing 
relations with Vietnam 19 years after it suffered its first 
defeat in war. The U.S. lifting of the embargo on Vietnam must 
have been prompted by economic realities in which the United 
States realized that it can no longer afford to stand aloof by 
Vietnam's golden market. Besides, the Vietnamese authorities 
have shown positive and quick responses toward the solution of 
the issue of U.S. soldiers missing in action (MIA's) in the 
Vietnam war. 
  U.S. economic sanctions on Vietnam have been such an 
agonizing shackle to the United States it may be said that they 
applied economic sanctions on one another. 
  Therefore, while the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam has 
long been envisaged, the decision on lifting the embargo had to 
take into account how sincerely the Vietnamese Government pushed 
ahead with the search for the remains of the 2,239 U.S. MIA's. 
No matter how important the Vietnamese market may be, the 
Clinton administration had to be sensitive to potential 
criticism from the U.S. war veterans association and the 
association of families of MIA's. 
  During his visit to Hanoi toward the end of last month, 
however, (Charles Larson), commander of the U.S. Pacific Forces 
who is charged with the search operation for the U.S. MIA's, 
highly appraised the Vietnamese authorities' efforts in which 
they even offered prize money. Adding that, "If the United 
States normalizes relations with Vietnam, it will facilitate the 
resolution of the MIA issue," he opened a way to lifting the 
embargo. 
  Lawmakers of the U.S. Senate Energy Committee Appropriations 
Subcommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee 
Asia-Pacific Subcommittee visited Vietnam. Upon their return 
home, they helped adopt a resolution calling for the lifting of 
the embargo on Vietnam, thus enabling the government to lift the 
embargo. 
  We can better understand the background behind the steps 
taken in order to lift the embargo on Vietnam in view of the 
fact that some 300 U.S. businesses, including such multinational 
enterprises as Citibank, General Electric Co., and Mobile, have 
arrived in Vietnam to begin their brisk marketing activities 
there. 
  Since Vietnam introduced the doi moi renovation policy in 
1986, along the lines of the former Soviet Union's perestroyka 
and glasnost example, it has achieved an economic miracle with 
an annual average economic growth rate of 7 percent from 1991 to 
1993 and an annual inflation rate of 5 percent or lower from its 
previous three-digit inflation rate. Vietnam's potential, no 
doubt, is attractive to U.S. businesses. 
  With the lifting of the embargo, investment and cooperation 
between the two countries is expected to increase in various 
fields, such as in construction, real estate, finance, 
manufacturing, and in petroleum and gas projects. Brisk 
activities are already evident with Mobile's signing last 
December of a contract to develop the (Tan Long) oil field. 
  However, the lifting of the embargo may not smoothly lead to 
the complete normalization of relations, for the United States 
will probably use the issue of normalizing diplomatic relations 
as leverage in securing the initiative in negotiations on 
pending issues, such as the MIA issue, the signing of an 
investment guarantee agreement, the lifting of the freeze on 
U.S. assets in Vietnam, and the human rights issue. 
  Following President Clinton's 4 February announcement of the 
lifting of the embargo, he clarified that "This does not mean we 
are normalizing relations," and this supports the above analysis. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. lifting of the embargo on Vietnam may 
well have considerable impact on the world, as well as the Asian 
economy, because it is a signal heralding the official rebirth 
of the Vietnamese market, which is called "Asia's last golden 
market" second only to the Chinese market, in the Asian economic 
sphere.

<F P=106> ["Statement" issued by spokesman of the Foreign Affairs </F>
Ministry of the Lao People's Democratic Republic -- date not 
given; read by announcer] 
  [Text] In late January, the Senate of the United States 
discussed the issue of the lifting of the trade embargo against 
Vietnam. Following the discussion, the Senate overwhelmingly 
voted in favor of the lifting of the trade embargo. Later, on 3 
February 1994, President Bill Clinton officially announced his 
decision to lift the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam. 
  The Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], as a 
neighboring 
country which has shared the same difficult destiny as Vietnam, 
is delighted with this pleasant news and would like to sincerely 
welcome President Bill Clinton's decision. The government and 
people of Laos are of the view that this decision conforms to 
the regional trend and the current global situation, and meets 
the aspirations of the Vietnamese and the American peoples as 
well as the peoples of the entire Southeast Asian region. 
  Though the lifting of the trade embargo marks a significant 
step toward trade cooperation and exchanges of visits between 
Vietnam and the United States, the step which is widely 
acclaimed by peace- and justice-loving people in the world -- 
the normalization of relations between the two countries -- 
still remains to be taken. In view of this, the LPDR Government 
hopes that the lifting of the trade embargo will serve as a 
significant development toward enabling the relations between 
the two countries to advance toward normalization at an early 
date.

  [Text] Malaysia welcomes the lifting of U. S. embargo on 
Vietnam. Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said it is 
important that Vietnam recovers from the effects of the war and 
grows to prosper just like other countries in Southeast Asia. 
  Replying to a question at an open forum with the members of 
the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Manila, he 
said Malaysia believes when countries are prosperous they are 
less likely to cause problems to their neighbors. 
  He said already Vietnam is moving very forward and that is 
the result of the investment of (?southern) countries, including 
Malaysia. He feels that Malaysia should invest and help Vietnam 
recover so that it has invested in the stability of the region. 
In this way its people will become properous and buy more goods 
from Malaysia. 
  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir is also asked on the possibility of 
bringing in the professionals from the Philippines to overcome 
the shortage in Malaysia. He said this is one area that could 
be looked into by both countries.

  [Excerpt] For the heirs to the heroism of the Vietminh, the 
bruising of the American ego by defeat in the Vietnam War had 
cut both ways. The United States, booted out of a dirt-poor 
Third World country as a neocolonial oppressor, would never 
again meddle in Indochina -- an outcome that was to dull the 
sweetness of victory into the blandness of irony in the course 
of time. Vietnam's seasoned soldiers found it hard to 
consecrate their glory in peace, and for more than a decade 
after the fall of Saigon in 1975, they strove to rule the 
regional roost, standing up to all outside pretenders. The 
exertions of military power, even after the roost was reached, 
could not still the groans of empty stomachs, however. The doi 
moi [renovation] reforms were instituted in 1986, and soon 
after, the irony of victory was made plain. Vietnam's economic 
horizons were clouded by the sore indifference of the world's 
biggest economic power. 
  Until today the injured pride of American patriotism is 
still 
refusing to heal, and upon turning its back on Indochina, 
America found it hard to forgive and forget. Thus, the 
sourpuss' fault-finding denial of diplomatic and economic good 
sense -- since the end of Cold War rivalry, U.S. policy over 
Vietnam, and by extension, the whole of Indochina, has been held 
to ransom by a handful of MIA refuseniks. How the MIA issue, 
the agitprop made out of 2,238 missing in-action servicemen 
still unaccounted for, can still sear the national conscience, 
is due to the recrudescence of Yankee pride marked by the Reagan 
presidency after years of liberal protest and self-doubt. 
  Only the right-wing America Firsters can carry the 
compulsion 
to get even as belatedly as this and assign Ann Mills Griffiths, 
executive director of the National League of Families (of MIA's) 
a central role in the highest inter-agency policy planning 
level. "Because of her, U.S. policy towards Vietnam was 
determined by the narrow -- albeit deserving -- concerns of the 
MIA families," according to a pro-normalisation advocate in 
Washington. The Clinton Administration, in spite of its eye on 
the domestic implications of foreign policy, has kept a safe 
distance from the emotive pull of the bereaved families. To the 
president's credit, he has attempted a rational tack, one 
directed at a constituency governed by the hard facts of 
economic realism. The announcement of the lifting of the 
30-year-old trade embargo was excitedly welcomed by U.S. 
businessmen in Hanoi yesterday. 
  In spite of Clinton's cleverness at political dissimulation 
-- he said the embargo's withdrawal was intended to get the 
"fullest possible accounting" of the MIAs and denied its 
practical merits -- the move is a first step towards long 
overdue normalisation. Part of this procrastination has been 
due to Clinton himself: a good-guy president who is much too 
vulnerable to angry placard-waving. No matter how it has been 
packaged and disguised, the president's hard-headed practicality 
in the Vietnam issue is a change from his usual weak-stomached 
dallying over foreign policy. Vietnam, of course, has it all to 
gain. No one is going overboard in expectations of a flood, but 
at least the door has been flung wide open. Even with the 
embargo in place, although somewhat relaxed, Vietnam obtained 
7.5 percent economic growth in 1993. Without its biggest single 
constraint, that economy could well grow by more than 10 percent 
this year. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Former President Daniel Ortega recognized the 
decision of U.S. President Bill Clinton to suspend the trade 
embargo on Vietnam that had been in effect since 1975 and called 
on the U.S. President to follow suit with the people of Cuba. 
  [Begin Ortega recording] What has happened? Despite the 
embargo and the blockade, Vietnam continued to grow and develop. 
Finally, in an intelligent and courageous measure -- we must 
recognize this -- U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to lift 
the trade embargo on Vietnam. We are now sending a message to 
President Clinton telling him that we recognize his courageous 
action of bringing justice to the Vietnam case because U.S. 
policy was unfair as long as the embargo and blockade were 
maintained. 
  We recognize President Clinton's courageous act because 
there 
are extremists in the United States who are already criticizing 
him for lifting the embargo against Vietnam. We also tell 
President Clinton that just as he was brave enough to lift the 
embargo on Vietnam, he must have the courage to lift the embargo 
on Cuba, because that is a real disgrace to the policy of U.S. 
leaders. [applause] [end recording] 
  The United States imposed the trade embargo on Vietnam in 
1975, when U.S. troops were defeated by the Vietnamese people.

<F P=106> [Viktor Pritula Commentary: "There Will Be No Change of </F>
Priorities"] 
  [Text] Hanoi -- Thirty years after the beginning of the 
aggression in Vietnam, the U.S. Administration has announced the 
lifting of the economic embargo against Hanoi. This is 
unquestionably an historic event, as was shown by the 
unprecedented number of foreign journalists and diplomats who 
attended the press conference given by Le Mai, Vietnamese deputy 
foreign minister. 
  However, despite the significance of Clinton's decision, it 
aroused no undue euphoria in Vietnam. Deputy Minister Le Mai, 
who read out the Vietnamese Government statement, stressed that 
Vietnam welcomes this move, which it considers important and 
useful both for the peoples of the two countries and for the 
cause of peace in the region. Answering journalists' questions 
afterwards, the Vietnamese diplomat said that the lifting of the 
embargo will have no effect on the foreign policy doctrine of 
Vietnam, which advocates the development of relations with all 
countries in the interests of peace and cooperation. In other 
words, a cardinal shift of priorities is not on the cards. 
  But Vietnam does have its priorities. After the collapse of 
the socialist community and the disintegration of the Soviet 
Union Vietnam turned firmly toward the Asia and Pacific region. 
Last year there was a perceptible economic rapprochement with 
the West European countries, too. Thus Vietnam's integration 
into the system of world economic cooperation has begun without 
any participation by the superpowers, one of which meanwhile 
lost that status while the other continued to maintain its 
anti-Vietnam embargo. 
  When President Clinton asserts that the lifting of the 
embargo is dictated solely by a desire to speed up and complete 
the solution of the problem of Americans missing in action 
during the Indochina war, there is a definite element of 
craftiness in his words. The Vietnamese leadership has 
repeatedly stressed that the solution of this problem on 
Vietnam's part is purely humanitarian in character and has no 
political or economic motives. The search for the remains of 
the U.S. MIA's would have continued regardless of the lifting or 
extension of the embargo. 
  In the opinion of many analysts the lifting of the embargo 
was dictated more by the economic interests of U.S. business, 
for whom Vietnam is the key to Indochina. The dynamic 
development of the Vietnamese economy, which is far from 
overheating, the pragmatism of that country's leadership, its 
great natural and human resources, and, most important, absolute 
political stability make Vietnam one of the most attractive 
targets for foreign investors today. 
  Vietnam is available for cooperation with America. But it 
must be mutually beneficial cooperation, not one that is 
conditioned by any political requirements. I was told that by 
the leaders of Hanoi enterprises with whom I have talked in the 
past few days. They stressed that they are not expecting 
miracles from Washington. In the opinion of some Vietnamese 
directors it would be naive, not to say stupid, to change the 
economic priorities today. America is a superpower of course, 
my interlocutors said, but in the economic sphere there are 
other superpowers, such as Japan in Asia. There are also the 
new Asian "tigers," whose rapprochement with Vietnam is evident. 
In January the Japanese granted Vietnam a credit of 0.5 billion 
[currency not specified] on preferential terms and they are now 
first among its trading partners. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and 
Singapore are top of the list of foreign investors. 
  The lifting of the U.S. embargo, in my view, demonstrates 
first and foremost the pragmatism of Washington politicians, who 
know how to listen to the opinions of their country's 
enterprises. U.S. business will now begin to try to secure a 
position in the promising Vietnamese market, even if it is 
somewhat late starting. 
  It will bring its capital and technologies here for reasons 
that are far from philanthropic. But it is more advantageous 
for it to come to a still poor and backward Vietnam than to the 
vast expanses of a former superpower where, in the words of its 
president, the "idol of communism" has already been destroyed. 
U.S. businessmen are afraid of wreckers and prefer creators 
even if the latter have retained a loyalty to communist 
ideology. This, too, is one reason for the lifting of the 
anti-Vietnam embargo.

Kondratyev; from the "Good Evening, China" program] 
  [Text] The U.S. Senate's vote to lift the trade embargo on 
Vietnam in late January to a great extent heralded President 
Clinton's announcement on Thursday [3 February]. Needless to 
say, the announcement is an important event which will exert a 
favorable influence not only on U.S.-Vietnamese relations but 
also on the situation in Indochina as a whole. 
  In recent years, Vietnam has done a host of work searching 
for U.S. soldiers missing in action from the Vietnam war. It 
can be stated with certainty that after the lifting of trade 
embargo, Hanoi will more actively cooperate with Washington in 
solving this issue which is rather sensitive to the American 
people. 
  Another factor in lifting the trade embargo is economics. 
U.S. business circles have estimated that their losses in 
Vietnam resulting from the trade embargo amount to $700-800 
million annually. It is true that U.S. companies are allowed to 
do business in Vietnam, but this is only in partnership with 
companies of other countries. Such business restrictions can, 
of course, limit the profits of U.S. businessmen. According to 
experts' estimates, Vietnam is one of the few Southeast Asian 
countries with the best potential for economic cooperation. 
Undoubtedly, Vietnam is also an indispensable springboard for 
economic cooperation with other countries on the Indochinese 
peninsula. 
  The lifting of the trade embargo on Vietnam will also exert 
a 
favorable influence on restoring U.S.-Vietnamese diplomatic 
relations and political contacts. Washington has decided to set 
up a liaison office in Hanoi, and it can be converted into a 
diplomatic mission in the future. 
  What is noteworthy is that the lifting of the embargo on 
Vietnam has also activated the campaign in the United States to 
end the trade embargo on its neighbor, Cuba. Many mass 
organizations and business representatives have taken part in 
the campaign. U.S. businessmen are dissatisfied over being 
deprived of the opportunity to invest in Cuba while their 
competitors from Europe and Latin America are actively exploring 
markets in Cuba. As time passes, the lifting of the U.S. trade 
embargo on Cuba will likely become a more heated issue.

the lifting of the trade embargo against Vietnam. The Singapore 
Federation of Chambers and Industries said much business would

  [Text] Singapore companies believe the lifting of the U.S. 
trade embargo on Vietnam will bring increased opportunities, 
more than increased competition. 
  With their headstart and good relationship with the 
Vietnamese, the companies here believe they can only benefit 
from the greater influx of U.S. technology, funds, and resulting 
business activities. 
  One such company is Asia Pacific Breweries [APB], which has 
a 
U.S.$22-million (Singapore $34.76-million) brewery investment in 
the country. Said its spokesman: "We welcome the competition 
as this will encourage the beer market to grow even faster. We 
will certainly be working harder, but at the end of the day, APB 
can only benefit from such accelerated growth". 
  Sembawang Engineering's executive chairman, Mr. Cheong Quee 
Wah, said that there will now be additional sources of 
technology and funds for infrastructure projects in Vietnam. He 
added that there is enough business for everyone there. He said 
that Sembawang Engineering, which is developing an $80 million 
[Singapore dollars] power plant there, has established close 
relationships with the Vietnamese, and could even co-operate 
with American companies in infrastructure projects in the future. 
  The Koh Brothers Group, which has just completed a hotel 
project in Ho Chi Minh City and is planning to work on road and 
canal projects there, also sees only greater opportunities. Its 
business manager, Mr. Joseph Koh, said: "The lifting of the 
U.S. embargo will help to increase all business activities in 
Vietnam, and we believe that as one of the early birds, we have 
developed a knowledge of business practises there." 
  Mr. Jen Shek Voon, a director of Ernst &amp; Young 
Consultants, 
believes that Singapore can now capitalise on its reputation as 
an honest broker and effective deal maker in Vietnam better than 
anyone else. "Finally, all Singapore-based companies will be 
able to utilise the excellent government-to-government 
relationship that we have with Vietnam," he said. Agreeing, Mr. 
David Howell of international law firm Baker Mckenzie said: 
"Singapore is well placed to take advantage of its partnering 
strategy with multinationals to penetrate Vietnam". 
  And Ms. Cheah Swee Gim, a partner with local law firm Chor 
Pee &amp; Co. said her firm was confident that it would hold its 
own 
against U.S. law firms going into Vietnam. "Some potential 
foreign clients have told us that they think a Singapore law 
firm understands the social and bureaucratic culture of Vietnam 
better than others," she noted. Chor Pee opened licensed 
representative offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City last May, 
and is looking to employ more lawyers to work there, she said. 
  But of course the outlook for Singapore companies in Vietnam 
is not all rosy. Cycle &amp; Carriage Ltd [CCL], while bullish on 
its 50-percent stake in a joint venture to operate a car rental 
fleet and build a modern vehicle workshop in Ho Chi Minh City, 
sounded a cautionary note on broader business prospects there. 
CCL director Philip Eng cautioned that "progress in a socialist 
environment will be slow and real progress will only be seen at 
the turn of the century".

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday received 
from Washington yesterday a report on the lifting of the U.S. 
trade embargo against Vietnam. President Bill Clinton made the 
decision after the U.S. Senate on 28 January voted 62 against 38 
for the abrogation of the law on a trade embargo against 
Vietnam. The lifting of the U.S. embargo can be regard as the 
opening of the door to the world market for Vietnam because the 
trade boycott created numerous obstacles to trade and investment 
development in that country. As a result, not only Vietnam but 
also all countries, including the U.S. private sectors, will 
benefit from this new move for they will be able to do business 
in Vietnam, which is one of the markets and investment areas in 
the Asia and Pacific region that is of high potential. 
  As a close neighboring country of Vietnam, Thailand is 
extremely pleased with the U.S. president's decision and regards 
it as ending the past conflict and beginning a period of peace 
and economic development in Indochina and the Southeast Asian 
region. 
  Speaking to reporters during an interview right after 
learning about the report at Government House yesterday, Deputy 
Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan said: 
  [Begin Amnuai recording] Not only the United States but also 
other countries will invest in Vietnam because the process of 
economic development is currently being carried out with the 
cooperation of several countries in line with the so-called 
globalization system. For this reason, all countries, including 
Thailand, will benefit from the lifting of the embargo. We will 
have to closely monitor this new development. Our 
entrepreneurs, business people, and industrialists should render 
their cooperation because they can also share in the benefit 
along with Vietnam and other countries. [end recording] 
  Asked about the anticipated increase of Thai investment in 
Vietnam, the deputy prime minister said: 
  [Begin Amnuai recording] There is nothing wrong with this if 
it is for mutual interests. If we have the resources, we can 
form joint investment ventures with them. This is a common 
practice because all the parties concerned will gain. 
Meanwhile, it does not mean that we will not invest in our own 
country. In fact, Thailand's economy is much more advanced than 
theirs. Our market is big and wide. We have the buying power. 
Nobody wants to turn away from Thailand. Provided we manage 
our economy properly, our market will continue to expand 
rapidly. This new development will benefit our region, 
particularly in the areas of international security and 
political stability. [end recording]

  [Text] Speaking to reporters on the effect on Thailand of 
the U.S. decision to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam, 
Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said one favorable 
effect is that Thai and U.S. investors will be able to jointly 
invest in businesses in that country. However, there will be an 
adverse consequence in the agricultural area, as Vietnam will 
become a formidable competitor of Thailand in the future. 
Churin said: 
  [Begin Churin recording, in progress] ...our agricultural 
products such as rubber and coffee. Vietnam also produces these 
crops and the United States is a big coffee-consuming country. 
The negative side is that Vietnam will become our competitor in 
the U.S. market. The United States is the third biggest market 
for our coffee. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Chokchai Aksoranan, chairman of the Chamber of 
Industries of Thailand, said foreign investment in Vietnam will 
increase. American investors can join hands with their Thai 
counterparts in that country. Hence, Vietnam's demand for 
commodities will rise and this will benefit the marketing of 
Thai products. However, in the long run, Thai entrepreneurs 
must readjust and reduce their production costs to compete with 
Vietnam.

  [Excerpts] The Thai Government yesterday welcomed the 
lifting of the US embargo against Vietnam as an opportunity for 
both countries to grow economically. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said the move 
will be to the advantage of both Vietnam and Thailand. It will 
be a catalyst in the development of Vietnam, as more investors 
will go in, but it will be for Vietnam to amend its existing 
laws and regulations to tempt investors, he said. The transfer 
of funds will become more convenient, and the Mekong Sub-region 
Project will benefit as Vietnam will be encouraged to take part, 
he said. Suphachai assured Thai investors that Vietnam will not 
become a competitor because Thailand is several steps ahead of 
Vietnam in manufacturing. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan commented that he does 
not expect Vietnam to represent a serious threat to Thai rice 
exports to the US as a result of the move. The US imports Thai 
glutinous rice because there are many Asians living there, and 
normally the US does not import rice from any country because of 
its rice surplus. Amnuai said Thailand's strong economic growth 
will prevent a significant shift of foreign investment away from 
Thailand to Vietnam. "Nobody will abandon Thailand for 
Vietnam," he said. "What we should worry about is how to manage 
and control our strong growth." 
  Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said that Thailand 
as one of the main gateways to Indochina stands to benefit from 
increased trade and regional investment. "The lifting of the 
embargo will stimulate trade and investment in the region," 
Abpisit told UPI. "It is positive development for Thailand." 
But the lifting of the embargo will eliminate the necessity to 
trans-ship products through Thailand to Vietnam. "Definitely it 
will affect certain kinds of Thai businesses," Aphisit said. 
"Some will benefit from this and some will lose. We have to 
accept the (Vietnamese) competition." [passage omitted] 
  Kroekkrai Chiraphaet, Director-General of the Business 
Economics Department, said the move will mean keener competition 
for Thailand. "Vietnam may take three to five years to catch up 
with us, especially in products such as textiles, shoes, 
electronics, computer components and electrical appliances, he 
said. But it does not take long to establish factories and 
Vietnam has a comparative labour advantage, he said. Thailand's 
labour costs are moving up, therefore it should seek a 
comparative advantage in manufacturing quality. Thailand must 
catch up with Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong and step away 
from competitors. The influx of investors to Vietnam implies 
that they want to gain a greater share of the local market, 
Kroekkrai said. 
  Due to its proximity to Vietnam, Thailand enjoys a decisive 
advantage in certain businesses such as construction materials 
and certain Thai consumer products. These have gained market 
recognition from being smuggled into Vietnam over the past two 
decades. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday 
hailed US President Bill Clinton's removal of 30-year old trade 
sanctions against Vietnam as a move that would benefit Thailand 
and the region. At the same time, Mr Surin acknowledged that the 
return of US business to Vietnam would have some repercussions 
on Thailand. He did not elaborate on the repercussions, but said 
they should serve to prompt Thais to "pay more attention' to 
economic developments in the region. "Thailand will benefit from 
economic development in Vietnam," he said. "The region is a free 
market. The emergence of Vietnam in the market system will 
enable the region to develop trade, investment and tourism 
ties," he said. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement said the removal of the US 
embargo would not only improve the "atmosphere" between the US 
and Vietnam but also foster economic development in Vietnam and 
the Southeast Asian region. 
  The Foreign Ministry's East Asia Department 
director-general, 
Don Pramutwinai, said better economic conditions expected to 
come with the removal of the US embargo are unlikely to lead to 
political liberalisation in Vietnam. It was a "matter of theory" 
that people enjoying better living standards would demand 
political freedom, he said. In reality, the situation in Vietnam 
was different because the Communist Party remained firmly in 
charge of the country, he said. The party recently made clear 
that it would retain the existing system, indicating that 
political and economic policies were working, he said. "If 
existing conditions in Vietnam are suitable for the country, why 
should they be changed?" But the future of communism in Vietnam 
depended on economic developments in the world at large and 
Vietnam's response to them, he said. Vietnamese people were 
unlikely to demand political change "because they have been 
under strict control," he said. Vietnam learned from 
pro-democracy protests in the Soviet Union and China where there 
were demands for political reform after economic improvements. 
  Demands for democracy and human rights in Vietnam were more 
likely to come from the United States, he said. "If the 
Americans don't make the demand, no one else will," he said. 
  Another official said that better economic conditions would 
improve Vietnam's access to the outside world, and this might 
lead to demand for change especially among Vietnamese in the 
southern part of the country. The southerners were previously in 
contact with the West and, with a better economy, might demand 
political change, he said. The official cited the pro-democracy 
demonstrations in Tienanmen Square in Peking in 1989. But he 
noted that Vietnam's Communist Party was "more hardline" than 
that of China and that it remained unpredictable how Hanoi would 
adjust to any demand for political change. 
  Deputy Foreign Ministry spokesman Rawi Hongpraphat said the 
removal of the US embargo would help ease tension in Southeast 
Asia. Economically, Lt [Lieutenant] Rawi warned that Thais would 
have to work harder because there would be competition in the 
cheaper labour market in Vietnam. 
  Another official pointed out that there would also be 
competition for Thailand in terms of US capital and technology. 
"Thai businessmen must work harder because other investors from 
the US have big money and high technology needed in Vietnam," 
the official said. "Our investors have the edge only in terms of 
experience in some, not many, sectors." The entry of US business 
into Vietnam would lead to more systematic economic development 
of the country, he said. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] US President Bill Clinton's decision to lift a 
long-standing trade embargo against Vietnam had been expected. 
[passage omitted] 
  In his White House speech, Clinton said the time for 
bitterness was over and now was the time for a new beginning 
between Hanoi and Washington. This is indeed laudable and the 
US president could not have said it better. 
  The reconciliation process was a long difficult one for the 
United States due to the great bitterness the Vietnam War had 
caused among the American people. At that time it was perceived 
that a communist regime had beaten the free world superpower of 
the day, and this did not go down well with the American people. 
  When the embargo was extended after 1975, its purpose was to 
squeeze more information from Vietnam regarding the American 
MiAs. [missing in action] Veterans groups and families of the 
MiAs were of course very emotionally involved, just wanting to 
know what happened to their loved ones. 
  Hence there was a great deal of pressure on a number of US 
administrators to keep the embargo intact until there was a full 
accounting of the missing servicemen. [passage omitted] 
  For the Vietnamese to forgive and forget is also laudable. 
It has to be remembered the extent to which the Vietnamese have 
suffered from the ravages of war. Since 1946 they have fought 
five wars almost continuously, and nearly 10 percent of the 
population of about 71 million is totally disabled. 
  Interestingly enough, one of the key questions on the minds 
of many is to what degree the issue of trade played a part in 
the presidential decision. Clearly, American companies have 
been represented in Hanoi for a long time but the embargo has 
always prevented them from assuming a full role in the booming 
Vietnamese economy. Because of this they have been forced to 
stay on the sidelines while European, Australian, Japanese, 
South Korean and Hong Kong companies have been able to get a 
good head start on them. 
  Obviously, this factor has been the main point of 
consideration, though in answering questions from reporters 
Clinton said the trade question did not influence his decision. 
  Unfortunately, the lifting of the trade embargo is not quite 
the same as the normalization of relation between Washington and 
Hanoi. Normalization usually involves the exchange of 
ambassadors and other diplomatic ties and these were certainly 
not a part of the current presidential decision. 
  However, it can be assumed that Vietnam will be seeking 
diplomatic ties with the United States. Since the collapse of 
the Soviet Union, Hanoi has been looking for a guarantor 
against China's expanding role in the region and sees Washington 
now being able to play the part. 
  The establishment of a US liaison office in Hanoi is indeed 
positive development and this must be seen as the first step on 
the path towards normalizing ties between the two countries. 
  With the lifting of the trade embargo, the United States and 
Vietnam can now look forward to a better future. This is indeed 
a good omen for the beginning of the new lunar year next week 
because, for the first time in decades, Vietnam is not at war or 
in conflict with any country.

  [Excerpts] If everything went as planned, by now, on 
Friday in Washington D.C. (Saturday in Thailand), President Bill 
Clinton must already have announced a major decision to lift the 
trade sanctions imposed for 30 years on Vietnam, its adversary. 
  The decision of the U.S. leader will turn a new page in the 
history of relations between the United States and Vietnam, now 
free of conditions from the Indochina war. [passage omitted] 
  Those benefiting from the removal of the trade sanctions are 
none other than private American companies which, from now on, 
will be able to reap profits from Vietnam in full after allowing 
Japan to gain huge interests for so long. 
  The American business sector believed that the sanctions 
caused more damage to the United States than to Vietnam. It 
deprived the U.S. private sector of huge "business 
opportunities" during the 30 years of the sanctions. [passage 
omitted] In the eyes of American businessmen, Vietnam is no 
longer the enemy who killed more than 50,000 American GIs during 
the war. Vietnam of the "new era" for them is a country with 
high economic potential and the possibility of becoming another 
"new tiger in Asia." More importantly, Vietnam can serve as a 
"base" in the economic power play as a balance against China and 
Japan. [passage omitted] 
  However, experts on this matter do not think the United 
States will restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam as easily 
as it decided to lift the trade sanctions (which stood for 
economic commitments). 
  For the United States, the question of diplomatic relations 
with Hanoi must certainly be linked with the question of human 
rights, democracy development, and other conditions. Thus, it 
will take a long time before the two countries can establish 
full diplomatic relations. 
  As for President Clinton, he has once again demonstrated 
political `courage' despite the fact that he risked being 
opposed by war veterans. Yet the risk is worthwhile because he 
has gotten full support from the business and political sectors, 
especially from the rival Republican Party. With all the pros 
and cons taken into account, it can be said that the whole of 
the United States stands to gain from this action.

  [Text] On the evening of 9 February, Defense Agency 
Director General Kazuo Aichi exchanged views by telephone with 
new U.S. Defense Secretary Perry on the issue of nuclear 
inspections in the DPRK (North Korea). During the telephone 
conversation, they agreed on the need for Japan and the United 
States to communicate and cooperate closely with each other in 
dealing with the issue. 
  Mr. Aichi telephoned Mr. Perry to congratulate him on his 
assumption of office as secretary of defense. According to Mr. 
Aichi, they affirmed that the rough sailing at the Japan-U.S.

<F P=106> [Interview with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata by </F>
Kazuyuki Kanamori; place and date not given: "Keyperson--Tsutomu 
Hata: Heartfelt Necessity for Japan To Be `Permanent Member of 
UN Security Council'"] 
  [Text] Tsutomu Hata. Minister for Foreign Affairs. 
Head of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Born 1935. Joined 
Odakyu Bus Co. after graduating from Seijo University. First 
elected to Diet in 1969. Has held posts of minister of 
agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; minister of finance. 
  [Kanamori] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], 
which 
was negative toward security and the Self-Defense Forces, joined 
the coalition government. Isn't it difficult to manage the 
coalition government's foreign policy? 
  [Hata] When forming the coalition government following the 
general election, we agreed, before starting, to take over such 
basic things as foreign policy and security. But we did not say 
it was all right to take over everything. Time passes. We must 
seize the opportunity, and, while holding proper consultations, 
go on building a Japan which connects with the world. It is 
probably healthier if there are all sorts of debates during that 
process. By having all sorts of debates, the problem points will 
begin to be visible to the public. There were some who worried 
about whether a coalition government would be safe, but has it 
not, conversely, progressed in a good direction because the 
process can be seen? 
  [Kanamori] But there are dissenting views even within the 
coalition government concerning Japan becoming a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council, and it appears that Prime 
Minister Hosokawa, too, has become negative since the time of 
the Miyazawa government, saying "a reform of the United Nations 
is necessary as a precondition for that." Would you care to 
comment on that? 
  [Hata] There are all sorts of opinions regarding the fact 
that Japan has become a major power. One holds that it is better 
for Japan to live modestly, without trying to do something 
beyond its power, and one holds that the world would not 
recognize Japan if it did that. 
  When I was minister of finance, I also had various meetings 
with presidents and prime ministers of various countries. I was 
often told "Japan should address the world in a more active 
manner." The role of Japan has begun to be given more attention 
than Japan thinks. 
  Even looking at the conflicts in various regions of the 
world, most are not so much ideological rivalries as they are 
conflicts with a historical background, such as ethnic or 
religious rivalries. What has begun to be necessary in order to 
deal with them is not strength, but very delicate consideration 
and attention. I think Japan is a master of that aspect. 
  A good example is that UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia] head Yasushi Akashi, in Cambodia often did such things 
as appeal to people by radio, saying "putting the election into 
operation is the beginning of democracy." 
  [Kanamori] What are the benefits of becoming a permanent 
member of the Security Council? 
  [Hata] It is not a matter of benefit, it is that we are 
being 
asked to do so by the world. It is not a matter of looking good, 
or of saying that it is natural to become a permanent member of 
the Security Council because Japan has become a major power. 
  [Kanamori] What about disadvantages? 
  [Hata] It is probably feared that Japan might be forced to 
shoulder a military role in PKO [UN peacekeeping operations] if 
it became a permanent member of the Security Council, but there 
are any number of roles for Japan to play. Some people 
immediately let their imagination run in that direction, and shy 
away, but conversely, one can also propose that the United 
Nations get along without using military means. When I visited 
the United States in September to attend the UN General 
Assembly, expectations for Japan were so strong that there were 
requests for meetings from some 60 countries. 
  [Kanamori] They were from the economic side, were they not? 
  [Hata] Some were from that side, but others wanted to join 
forces with Japan and work to solve conflicts within regions. 
And there was also talk of wanting to use Japan's power in the 
economic development of neighboring countries. 
<H5>  "Taboos Are Bad" </H5>
  [Kanamori] Did the situation which divided public opinion 
end 
because the SDPJ joined the coalition? 
  [Hata] In such things as (then) chairman Yamahana visiting 
the Republic of Korea, the SDPJ has also begun to change after 
becoming a governing party. And though it is criticized this way 
and that, the one that has contacts with North Korea is the 
SDPJ, so I think the SDPJ will have a big role to play in 
improving relations with North Korea, which have now reached an 
impasse. 
  [Kanamori] One hears that one impediment to deregulation of 
rice has also been removed. 
  [Hata] People often say that taboos are bad. But, 
particularly in regard to rice, there is a strong aspect in 
which the media have gone and made it into a political and 
symbolic issue. It has begun to become clear that if the Uruguay 
Round reaches a showdown, actually not only Japan, but every 
country will have problems. Diplomacy is speaking frankly with 
each other during a clash between the egos of various countries. 
  [Kanamori] Secretary General Ozawa of Shinseito, who has 
great influence with the Hosokawa government, favors accepting 
tariffication of rice, so there are also many who are 
apprehensive, suspecting that it will probably happen. Would you 
care to comment on that? 
  [Hata] Ozawa has said for a long time that "it is better to 
protect what should be protected by a high tariff." But I fear 
that, even if it is initially a 70-percent tariff, Japan will 
probably be pressed repeatedly to make concessions by countries 
saying "Japan has a surplus, so concede more." I intend to 
develop foreign policy by seeking the best way to solve it, not 
a masochistic policy of saying that Japan will become isolated 
if it does not deregulate rice.

<F P=106> [Article by Tomoo Yamaguchi, political commentator: "The </F>
Existence of Taisaku Ikeda Cannot Be Ignored" second in a series 
entitled "The Persons Who Sustain the Hosokawa Government"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Yamagishi Wants To Flaunt Being a Person To Be 
Reckoned With </H3>
  The one who is commonly recognized to be a person who 
performed great service behind the scenes in regard to the birth 
of the Hosokawa coalition government is Akira Yamagishi, 
chairman of Rengo (National Confederation of Trade Unions). 
  In the election of Rengo officers that was held last 
September, Yamagishi was elected to a third term in recognition 
of his efforts and achievements directed toward establishment of 
the coalition government. 
  Even so, it was not the kind of thing one could call 
unanimous; it was because rival candidates stepped down 
reluctantly. It was certainly not a smooth election to a third 
term; there were such things as an argument for replacing 
Yamagishi emerging from local industrial unions connected with 
the former Sohyo [General Council of Trade Unions of Japan], 
which originally backed Yamagishi for chairman of Rengo. 
  An argument for bringing in a new generation came from major 
private-sector local industrial unions, and there also welled up 
a reaction against a Yamagishi line which leans excessively 
toward politics. 
  Certainly Rengo has suffered a series of defeats in the 
spring labor offensives of the last few years. Alienation of 
workers from unions has also become conspicuous, and although 
Rengo is a national center that mustered 8 million workers, the 
actual situation is that it has things which are far from what 
one would call the main headquarters of labor unions. 
  Moreover, the labor environment has become harsher and 
harsher because of the bursting of the bubble economy and 
stagnation of business conditions. With real discharging of 
workers and so on being carried out by such means as employment 
adjustment, layoffs, and company restructuring, the existence of 
labor unions is now about to be called into serious question. If 
Rengo is only for such fortunate workers as those in major 
private-sector unions and in public-sector unions, its meaning 
as a national center will also disappear. 
  It is also natural that calls to return to the labor 
movement 
come from within Rengo. There is even a feeling that most Rengo 
executives from Yamagishi on down have become "labor 
bureaucrats" rather than leaders of labor unions. 
  Because of the end of the East-West cold war structure, 
ideological rivalry has disappeared. The word "working class" 
has also become an obsolete word. It is to be expected that not 
only politics, but labor unions as well, are pressed by the 
necessity to grope for new policy lines. 
  It appears that Yamagishi tried to flaunt his sense of being 
a person to be reckoned with by intervening in politics with 
Rengo for a background. 
<H5>  Thesis of Ozawa's "Purification" Is a Staged Event </H5>
  Yamagishi was the one who first granted an indulgence in the 
question of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general 
Ichiro Ozawa "turning over a new leaf." 
  Yamagishi spoke out on the thesis of Ozawa's purification, 
saying "The past is the past. Everyone has a past. I think that 
for a person who up till now was at the heart of the government, 
and knows the delicious taste of politics, to abandon power by 
his own volition, resolving to take a big risk by wagering his 
political life, cannot be done by an average person. I think 
that Ozawa's political `purification' was completed by the 
formation of the new party. It is not a matter to go on 
discussing forever." 
  Ozawa appears to have been overjoyed by this statement. It 
is 
said that when, even after that, Sadao Yamahana, who was 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], said 
"the public still has doubts regarding the connection between 
Ozawa and the Sagawa scandal," Ozawa spoke immediately. 
  Ozawa said, even showing anger toward Yamahana, "It is no 
good because people say things, like Yamahana does. If you make 
up your minds on a coalition, get a firmer grip on yourselves. 
If you once say things clearly, like Yamagishi, everyone will 
stop asking." 
  But at a subsequent press conference, Yamagishi stated the 
true meaning of the thesis of Ozawa's purification, saying "My 
saying that Ozawa's purification was completed was a political 
judgment. I do not think that his purification is complete, 
either. I said it because I thought Ozawa would feel indebted to 
me if I came to his aid when he was being attacked. Even after 
forming a coalition government, he will probably not be able to 
do something like refusing what I ask." It was, so to speak, a 
type of "staged [yarase]" statement. 
  However, the truth be what it may, Ozawa and Yamagishi drew 
closer to each other rapidly through these circumstances. 
  During the lower house election as well, Ozawa devoted 
himself to burrowing underground, hardly appearing on the 
surface. During that time he conferred with Yamagishi at Rengo 
headquarters more than once. 
  While on the one hand Yamagishi is said to have performed 
great service in the birth of the Hosokawa coalition government, 
he has been branded a "Class-A war criminal" who caused the 
crushing defeat of the SDPJ because there were also cases in 
which SDPJ candidates who were excluded from recommendation by 
the Rengo selection lost in the election, but more than that, 
one cannot deny an overall lowering of the the SDPJ's image by 
Rengo making the selection. 
  But according to a survey of the voting behavior of members 
of the Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union (NTT's union), 
which is Yamagishi's original parent body, the rate of support 
for the SDPJ was 52.6 percent. The result has become clear that 
77 percent voted for SDPJ candidates in the last lower house 
election. Moreover, concerning recommended candidates in 
national elections, the number who say "even a Liberal 
Democratic Party candidate is all right" if he is sympathetic to 
the Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union, has risen to all of 
43 percent. 
  But in a February 1992 survey, the rate of support for the 
SDPJ in the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union 
was 26.5 percent, and in the All Japan Federation of Electric 
Machine Workers' Unions was 13.3 percent. 
  This means that the rate of support for the SDPJ in the 
Japan 
Telecommunication Workers' Union is still high, compared to the 
All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union and the All 
Japan Federation of Electric Machine Workers' Unions, but even 
though they are members of unions under the Rengo umbrella I 
cannot believe they are voting in accordance with Rengo 
headquarters' recommendations and support directives. 
  It is no exaggeration to say that Rengo has already been 
reduced to a shell, not only in such labor-movement activities 
as the spring offensives, but also in the aspect of a political 
movement. 
<H5>  Rengo's Demands Will Not Be Realized </H5>
  Be that as it may, how much meaning does establishing a 
nonLDP coalition government hold for Rengo? 
  To be sure, labor-management relations within companies and 
workers' rights are of course all very well, but it is necessary 
to win a share of the pie in the aspect of government policy. 
Because such things as shortening working hours, the tax system, 
and all types of pensions are policy questions that are 
necessary and vital to workers. 
  But if it becomes a matter of those who are working, that 
is, 
"workers," it means expanding to a national scale. If it becomes 
a matter of winning rights for one segment of workers, however, 
problems are generated. Consequently, there cannot be a 
coalition government for the benefit of Rengo. 
  But Yamagishi is delighted at the birth of the coalition 
government. 
  Yamagishi, who visited the prime minister's official 
residence immediately after the birth of the Hosokawa 
government, beamed as he shook hands with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, saying, "I feel as though I have come home." He may 
have had the thought that he built the coalition government. 
  This was probably because when former prime minister 
Miyazawa 
and Yamagishi conferred, Yamagishi was treated coldly, without 
even a handshake. 
  Just because a coalition government has been created does 
not 
mean that Rengo's demands are about to be realized. 
  In the time of LDP cabinets Rengo kept demanding income tax 
reductions. The argument for a broad reduction in income tax as 
a decisive factor in a policy to stimulate business conditions 
is being advanced from all sides, but the response of the 
government is not very different from that in the time of LDP 
governments. 
  The government is adopting a cautious attitude because of 
the 
problem of revenue sources. An increase in the consumption tax 
rate has become a precondition for tax reduction. At one time 
Rengo united with the SDPJ and opposed introduction of the 
consumption tax. 
  The situation is now such that an increase in the 
consumption 
tax cannot be avoided, but if it is this method, it would be 
possible to reduce income tax by any amount at all, even if it 
were not the coalition government. 
  Furthermore, the question of starting to pay welfare 
pensions 
at age 65, which Rengo opposed, has also become a situation in 
which it seems likely to be settled in the direction of LDP 
governments. 
  Yamagishi was welcomed warmly by Prime Minister Hosokawa, 
but 
that does not mean that Rengo's demands, themselves, will be 
respected. 
<H5>  Is the Breakup of Rengo Also in Sight? </H5>
  The Hosokawa cabinet is maintaining a high rate of support 
as 
usual, but it is probably a matter of a certain kind of 
freshness manifesting itself as hope because the characteristic 
hue of the Hosokawa cabinet has not been shown in concrete 
policy. 
  It is natural, because the coalition government parties 
agreed to carry on LDP government in basic policies, but one 
cannot sweep away the question: In that case, what is the 
purpose of the coalition government? 
  Of course, starting with the succession of suspicious 
incidents, at the peak is the question of a 500 million yen 
contribution from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin to former LDP vice 
president Shin Kanemaru, which further developed into questions 
of illegal contributions and evasion of taxes on a grand scale. 
Needless to say, corruption because of long rule by the LDP 
burst forth. 
  Speaking from that viewpoint, the fact that the coalition 
government put an end to the LDP's long rule has great political 
significance. 
  However, Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa was at the core 
of 
the former Tanaka-former Takeshita faction, which was referred 
to during the long rule of the LDP, in particular, as 
"one-faction rule," and he controlled a part of power to the 
extent that it was spoken of as "Kanemaru-Takeshita-Ozawa." 
  Because of Kanemaru's resignation from the Diet, the former 
Takeshita faction split up, and Ozawa was defeated temporarily 
in the power struggle. That Ozawa and his associates, the 
Hata-Ozawa faction, endorsed the no-confidence motion against 
former Prime Minister Miyazawa and proceeded to form a new party 
was Ozawa's counterattack against the anti-Ozawa forces. 
  The birth of the Hosokawa coalition government was, so to 
speak, a concentration of the Ozawa versus anti-Ozawa power 
struggle. 
  In a word, it means that Yamagishi supported Ozawa's 
struggle 
for power. Power struggles are inseparable from politics. In 
that sense, one cannot simply reject them, but what kind of 
meaning does the establishment of a non-LDP coalition government 
hold for Rengo? That point remains unclear. 
  Nevertheless, Yamagishi is moving energetically to cause the 
SDPJ to turn toward a more realistic line. The SDPJ may cease to 
exist even if Yamagishi does not move. 
  One can pass it off as the trend of the times, but will not 
the result be that Rengo will end up also losing the political 
base on which it depends? 
  There is probably also the logical view that, if the SDPJ 
ceases to exist, Rengo need only join hands with such new forces 
as Shinseito and the Japan New Party; but in that case the 
influence of Rengo would become markedly weaker. 
  Or, I even suspect that Yamagishi might foresee the future 
of 
Rengo as a national center, and have the breakup of Rengo in his 
sights. 
<H5>  The Close Relationship of Ozawa and Ikeda </H5>
  In contrast with Yamagishi, who acted openly, the one who 
did 
not once come out publicly, but is said to have supported 
Shinseito's Ozawa, is Taisaku Ikeda, honorary chairman of Soka 
Gakkai. 
  The LDP is doing things like demanding that Ikeda be 
summoned 
as a witness; that is because it is strongly conscious that 
Ikeda is behind Ozawa. 
  Shinseito and Komeito are said to now be in total unity, and 
[Ichiro] Ozawa and Komeito Chief Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa have 
such a close relationship that they are called the "Ichi-Ichi 
combination." 
  It is said that the greatest factor in Ozawa embarking on 
formation of Shinseito was because Soka Gakkai and Komeito 
promised complete support. 
  In Nagata-cho all sorts of information flew about concerning 
the relationship of these two. 
  There are such items as "the Soka Gakkai gave Shinseito's 
Ozawa 3 billion yen," or some such, and ones that said "10 
billion yen," and "the Soka Gakkai became the guarantor, and 
Shinseito received a loan of 5 billion yen from Mitsubishi Bank." 
  Of course, it is uncertain how much truth there is in these 
bits of information. Speaking from the proverb that where there 
is smoke there is fire, one can also suspect that there was 
probably some providing of funds, and on the other side one can 
also say that it is beneficial information. Because there is no 
way for anyone other than the persons involved to confirm 
questions about funds. 
  But in the last lower house election, Shinseito's funds were 
more abundant than those of the LDP. 
  The LDP provided each candidate with an endorsement 
allowance 
of 5 million yen and with 20 million yen for campaign expenses, 
but Shinseito gave an endorsement allowance of 5 million yen and 
30 million yen for campaign expenses, and it is said that 60 
million yen was given, depending on the candidate. 
  The situation was such that an executive of the Obuchi 
faction of the old Takeshita faction, who had once been a close 
comrade of the members of Shinseito, was shocked, asking, "Why 
does Shinseito have so much money?" 
  Up till now Soka Gakkai has depended on Kakuei Tanaka and 
Noboru Takeshita. As a huge religous organization, Soka Gakkai 
has all sorts of problems. There are many problems which require 
political power: doubts being raised about it as a religous 
corporate entity because of rivalry with the Ishiyamadera sect, 
suspicions regarding transactions in paintings by Renoir, it is 
being pressed to file revised reports because of a tax audit of 
Soka Gakkai headquarters, criticism of the thesis of unity of 
politics and religion in Komeito and Soka Gakkai, and so on. 
  But Takeshita, upon whom the Soka Gakkai relied up till now, 
is in the situation of having to leave the LDP because of 
intervention of the right wing and gangs when the Takeshita 
government began; and with the breakup of the Takeshita faction, 
which was his base, he can no longer be relied upon. 
  To the Soka Gakkai, it was in a situation in which it had to 
create a political force on which it could rely. Ikeda sekected 
Ozawa as his partner. 
<H5>  Soka Gakkai and Komeito Have Influence </H5>
  When Ozawa was LDP secretary general, he supported Hisanori 
Isomura in the Tokyo gubernatorial election and was defeated, so 
he took responsibility for it and resigned the post of secretary 
general, but it is said that the one who originally recommended 
Isomura as a candidate for governor was Ikeda. 
  It is judged that the problem of the Tokyo gubernatorial 
election was the turning point in the close relationship of 
Ozawa and Ikeda. Ichikawa is said to have been their go-between. 
  It is said that Ozawa never speaks out actively at meetings 
of the representatives of the coalition governing parties (made 
up of general secretaries and secretary generals). It is said 
that the one who has the power to lead the meeting in Ozawa's 
stead is Ichikawa, and that has become the conventional wisdom. 
To put it in another way, it is probably a matter of the 
cooperation between Ozawa and Ichikawa being that close. 
  It has been reported by all that the selection of Management 
and Coordination Agency Director General Koshiro Ishida, Posts 
and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki, Labor Minister 
Chikara Sakaguchi, and Environmental Agency Director General 
Wakako Hironaka, who joined the Hosokawa cabinet, was done by 
Ikeda. 
  In the last lower house election, Komeito replaced many 
candidates with younger ones. Former chairman Junya Yano, for 
example, was forced to step down in spite of having had some 
years to go before the mandatory retirement age. They cannot win 
election unless they have the support of Soka Gakkai. The will 
of Soka Gakkai is absolute. 
  Conversely, if they are endorsed officially by Komeito, 90 
percent are elected, without name recognition or anything else. 
  Komeito counters the LDP's "criticism that it combines 
religion and politics" by arguing that "Soka Gakkai is nothing 
more than a simple support organization," but it is clear just 
by looking at election results that it is not a simple support 
organization. 
  Moreover, Taisaku Ikeda's influence is so strong that Soka 
Gakkai is called "the teachings of Ikeda." 
  It is said that in the last lower house election also 
Komeito 
and Soka Gakkai supported Shinseito candidates across the board 
in election districts where they were not competing with Komeito 
candidates. 
  The "concept of a new new party" is about to become a 
reality 
between Shinseito and Komeito, and there is no impediment 
whatsoever on the Komeito side. 
  Ichikawa says things like "If it were to become a system of 
two major political parties, it would be all right to disband 
Komeito," but looking at it in strategic terms, is this not an 
attempt to grasp the power of one of the two large political 
parties? Because so long as Soka Gakkai exists, its 
organizational strength will truly be everlasting. 
  Ozawa insisted upon "power surpassing that of Komeito" as 
the 
condition for forming a new party. Was this not because, 
speaking from Ozawa's philosophy of numbers being power, he 
thought that with a force smaller than Komeito he would be 
unable to eliminate the influence of Komeito and Soka Gakkai? 
  Whatever the situation in the upper house, Shinseito 
surpassed Komeito in the lower house. Which means that, in that 
point, Ozawa's plan was able to be achieved provisionally. 
  But in order for Ozawa to continue to maintain influence 
within the coalition governing parties, Komeito's cooperation is 
indispensible in the current situation. This also means that 
Ikeda's support is necessary. 
  However, there is no talk of Ikeda having made any request 
directly to the Hosokawa coalition government. 
  Yamagishi cannot be compared with Ikeda in strength of real 
influence, but Ikeda is in the strange position of not being 
able to move in an open manner. It lies in the special nature of 
the leader of a religous organization, but on the other hand, it 
is also certain that he is an entity which the Hosokawa 
coalition government cannot ignore.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 11 February Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Some business leaders have given high marks to the 
draft 1994 budget presented by the Finance Ministry, saying it 
has given considerable consideration to spending for economic 
recovery despite tight financial conditions. Gaishi Hiraiwa, 
chairman of Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations], said: "I frankly welcome it since it has given 
major consideration to spending related to public works 
projects." Business circles have urged the government to 
compile the third supplementary budget and the fiscal 1994 
budget -- which together cover "a 15-month period" -- to avoid 
budget interruption. Also, there have been strong demands 
within business circles for further cuts in expenditures. 
  Business leaders are divided over whether the allocation of 
outlays for public works projects have been fully reviewed in 
the draft budget. Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry, spoke highly of the draft budget, 
saying: "It has placed emphasis on spending for housing and 
sewerage construction, which will lead to a higher quality of 
living for the people." Meanwhile, Osamu Uno, chairman of 
Kansai Economic Federation, said: "I do not see any remarkable 
results in the draft," and added, "I expect the government to 
drastically review the fixed budget allocation." 
  Masaru Hayami, chairman of Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association 
of Corporate Executives], said: "Drastic cuts in expenditures 
should be sought through a complete review of outlays for 
individual ministries and agencies." 
  With regard to negotiations between the Foreign Ministry and 
other government offices over reinstatement of budget requests, 
Hiraiwa said: "While taking international relations into 
consideration, the government should invest more money in a new 
social infrastructure such as science and technology, housing, 
information communication, and welfare." In this way, he 
indirectly noted the need to review defense and Official 
Development Assistance budgets. 
  Commenting on the 2.4-percent growth for the fiscal 1994 GDP 
[gross domestic product] forecast by the government, Hayami 
said: "This is a very high estimate. From our viewpoint, it is 
almost impossible to achieve such rapid growth. The government 
should devise measures to accurately forecast the actual state 
of the economy."

  [Text] Based on the Financial System Reform Act, the trust 
bank subsidiaries of Tokyo Bank and the four major securities 
companies began operating on 1 October in the second phase of 
mutual entry into trust banking by subsidiaries whose parent 
companies are in other fields. Due to the prolonged recession 
and the restrictions on their scope of activities, the 
subsidiaries are entering a harsh environment, and their 
prospects for profit are less than bright. However, each parent 
company has adopted a long-term strategy and intends, by means 
of distinctive management--providing new trust services, 
etc.--to meet diversifying trust needs and expand the market. 
<H5>  The First Group of Entrants Includes Five Companies </H5>
  The trust bank subsidiaries of Tokyo Bank and the four major 
securities companies began operating on 1 October. 
  The procedures that the parent companies followed in 
establishing their subsidiaries included the following: On 11 
August they obtained unofficial authorization from the Ministry 
of Finance for establishing a trust bank. On 24 August they 
obtained authorization for a special-case subsidiary 
[tokurei kogaisha] in accordance with the Banking 
Act, and authorization for a special-approval company 
[tokunin kaisha] in accordance with the Antitrust 
Act. On 3 September they obtained, from the banking industry, a 
license as well as authorization to operate a trust bank as a 
secondary business. With this, the legal procedures were 
completed. One thing that should be noted is that, in connection 
with authorizing the trust bank subsidiaries of the securities 
companies to conduct foreign exchange activities, the Ministry 
of Finance decided to authorize the full line of those 
activities. 
  Let's look at the starting size of each subsidiary as 
measured by its capital and number of employees. The smallest of 
the subsidiaries is Tokyo Trust Bank, with capital of 10 billion 
yen and 21 employees. According to the bank's president, Hiroshi 
Hayashi, "With regard to banking activities, we are a step ahead 
of the securities companies' trust banks as far as skill and 
know-how go, and we are concentrating on the services that are 
our strong suit." As small as this bank is, it is functioning 
well. 
  The biggest of the trust bank subsidiaries is Nomura Trust 
&amp; 
Banking, with capital of 30 billion yen and 71 employees. As 
mentioned below, this company claims that its strong suit is 
foreign exchange activities, for which it has an appropriately 
large number of employees. 
  The reason that each company has invested a liberal amount 
of 
capital is to balance the poor profit prospects with financial 
services. Initially, the capital for the securities companies' 
subsidiaries was planned at 1-2 billion yen. However, activities 
such as tokkin [specified money trusts], which were 
prospectively regarded as main sources of income, ended up not 
being authorized, as a result of which the capital was increased. 
  On this point, the difference between trust bank 
subsidiaries 
and securities subsidiaries might be mentioned. In the latter 
category, IBJ [Industrial Bank of Japan] Securities started with 
capital of 25 billion yen and 138 employees. At this company, as 
well as at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan [LTCB] Securities, the 
proportion of capital to number of employees was only about 200 
million/person, whereas it was more than double this, 400-500 
million yen/person, at the trust bank subsidiaries. This clearly 
shows the difference between business based on transaction 
commissions and business based on managing assets. 
  The staffs at the trust bank subsidiaries are composed 
mainly 
of young people who have experience conducting trust activities 
according to foreign laws and who have been sent to trust banks 
for training. They also include some people who were lured away 
from major trust banks. The opinion has been expressed that it 
will be necessary to increase the number of personnel when the 
regulations on the scope of activities are relaxed. At present, 
however, any movement towards increase is extremely cautious. 
What seems the prevailing attitude was expressed by Akira 
Kiyokawa, president of Nomura Trust &amp; Banking, who said, "We 
have no intention of increasing our staff to 200-300 people. 
Rather, we will seek to increase the specialization of each of 
our people so as to form an organization of specialists."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  Limiting Main Activities </H5>
  The scope of the activities of the first trust banks since 
the new law went into effect is extremely narrow. It includes 
banking activities, of course, as well as securities investment 
trusts, fund trusts, non-monetary trusts (except real estate 
trusts whose purpose is the disposal of trust property), public 
trusts, special donation trusts, etc. 
  According to Yoshinobu Isokawa, President of Yamaichi Trust 
Bank, "The fact that some of the activities--tokkin, shiteitan 
[the portion of postal savings and postal insurance funds 
designated for stock investment], etc.--that we wanted to 
include among our main activities were not even partially 
authorized is extremely painful to us in terms of nurturing the 
skills we need." Dissatisfaction on this point is strong. 
  Therefore, each of the companies has limited its main 
activities to ones with earning power, and set up a small staff 
of elite employees. In this way, each hopes to maintain profit 
and bring its own distinctive brand of activities management to 
the fore. 
  One of the activities common [to the new trust banks] is 
fund 
trusts. The four securities companies all mentioned securities 
investment trust deposits. About fund trusts, President Hayashi 
said they are "an interest-bearing item, an internationally 
diversified investment, a foreign exchange hedge-type of 
mid-risk, mid-return," whereas Tsutomu Yamashita, president of 
Nikko Trust Bank, said, "We offer a custom-made type of 
exclusive portfolio." Thus, everybody has a different emphasis. 
As regards securities investment trust deposits, "Japan's 
investment trust balance is one-fourth that of the United 
States," said Katsuhiko Fujimoto, president of Daiwa 
International Trust Bank; "future growth can certainly be 
expected. This is a field that our know-how can invigorate." 
This company aims to get investment trust deposits not only from 
within the Daiwa group, but also from foreign companies. 
  Activities related to monetary claims in trust are naturally 
one of the main activities of Tokyo Trust. What is drawing 
attention, however, is that Yamaichi Trust is also looking into 
them. In the case of Tokyo Trust, there are the claims of the 
parent bank and of the group, so it is easy to imagine Tokyo 
Trust undertaking these activities. As for Yamaichi Trust, 
President Isokawa said, "We will offer a mechanism that raises 
capital by converting installment sales claims ["kappu saiken"] 
to trust beneficiary rights." As this indicates, the target of 
these activities stretches from nonbanks to general 
corporations. For Yamaichi Trust, the key seems to lie in 
whether it can make use of the Yamaichi group's reported 
strength among corporate customers. 
  Nomura Trust &amp; Banking is the only trust bank 
subsidiary that 
mentioned foreign exchange activities as a main activity. The 
decision whether to conduct these activities hinges on whether 
the company is able and willing to maintain the needed system 
and number of employees. For the time being, Nomura Trust &amp; 
Banking will mainly handle the foreign exchange that occurs 
within the Nomura group. As to whether the companies in the 
group choose Nomura Trust &amp; Banking or their current banks, 
"It's fine with me if they make their decision on a commercial 
basis; otherwise, we won't grow," President Kiyokawa said with 
clarity and dignity. 
  One of the conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Finance 
for authorizing companies to establish not only trust bank 
subsidiaries but any subsidiary in a different field than that 
of the parent company is that, by its third year, the subsidiary 
must be operating in the black based on its current-term profit. 
Therefore, the fact that each of the five parent companies is 
claiming that its trust bank subsidiary "will be in the black 
after three years" is only natural. They are also saying that it 
will take an additional year or two to fully eliminate the 
accumulated loss. 
<H5>  Expectations From Relaxation of Regulations on Tokkin </H5>
  Now then, what do the various companies expect from the 
relaxation of the regulations governing the scope of their 
activities--said to be two to three years off? 
  According to President Yamashita, "Not only will there be an 
increase in the activities that we can conduct, but convenience 
to the customer will also improve markedly. I definitely want 
the relaxation of regulations to quickly become a reality." This 
opinion is widely shared. The need for relaxed regulations is 
particularly strong with regard to tokkin, which, due to 
relations with the parent company, will immediately become one 
of the activities of the trust bank subsidiaries. 
  On the other hand, loan trusts--one of the main activities 
of 
existing trust banks--are not popular among the trust bank 
subsidiaries. As President Isokawa said, "We are not thinking of 
entering retail activities, now or in the future." Nor is there 
currently any thought of engaging in such activities as land 
trusts, which require activities related to real estate, or 
annuity trusts, which require that specialists in actuaries, 
etc., be maintained. The activities strategies of the trust bank 
subsidiaries are unexpectedly not predicated on a relationship 
of competition with the existing trust banks. According to 
President Hayashi, "Trust banks have functions that enable them 
to offer even more services than now." And, according to 
President Isokawa, "In the financial field, trust banks should 
aim at activities other than those related to loans." Emphasis 
is thus being put on answering the needs that the existing trust 
banks are not adequately addressing. 
  A fair argument about financial system reform is that the 
relaxation of regulations and what activities a company conducts 
should be two different things. Ideally, the full line of 
activities will be allowed, and companies will be able to 
choose, according to their individual strategies, the ones at 
which they are best. However, the shadow of the existing trust 
banks is looming behind the Ministry of Finance, so there is no 
guarantee that things will progress according to what's fair. 
This is cause for concern among the new trust bank subsidiaries. 
  At the present stage, it is difficult to predict how the 
relaxation of regulations will be decided. However, it can 
probably be said that at least the vector along which the 
activities of the trust bank subsidiaries are developing is 
conforming to the spirit of financial system reform. There would 
be nothing strange if the newcomers tried to hold the existing 
trust banks in check by saying, "If the market weren't growing, 
it would be a different story; but given how the market is, the 
existing trust banks are guarding it too closely." 
  Each of the trust bank subsidiaries has expressed the 
intention of joining the Trust Companies Association. However, 
there is a problem: "the rent is too high." 
  The "rent" is several tens of millions of yen a year for 
members (seven companies exclusively engaged in trust banking 
and Daiwa Bank) and about 5 million yen a year for semi-members 
(nine foreign trust banks). The trust bank subsidiaries, who are 
resigned to being in the red for the first year or two, 
undoubtedly have considerable resistance to paying such a large 
sum. If they are unable to make it into the black after three 
years because of the "rent," it will be too ironic for tears. 
  A contention of the trust bank subsidiaries is that "since 
the scope of our activities is restricted, the amount of our 
`rent' should be proportionately reduced." At present, 
discussions between the association and the individual trust 
bank subsidiaries are continuing. When this magazine went to 
press, it seemed that the problem would be resolved. It would 
only be natural if some special measures or some time-limited 
measures were taken for the trust bank subsidiaries. 
  The five companies in this first group of new entrants into 
trust banking field have waited long to enter the field. They 
have thus had plenty of time to clarify their strategies, and so 
are expected to develop their activities in a way that makes the 
most of their individual characteristics. 
  As for other financial institutions that intend to establish 
trust bank subsidiaries, the National Society of Credit 
Associations is in the midst of preparing an application aimed 
at establishing one by next April, and the Japan Credit Bank is 
carrying out studies preliminary to establishing one.

Now Is a Good Opportunity To Introduce a System of Taxpayer ID 
Numbers: It is Necessary in Order To Thoroughly Capture Income 
Tax and Prevent Government Corruption"] 
  [Text] The 
current debate on the tax system, in which an increase in 
consumption tax is being called for, using "correction of the 
direct-indirect ratio" as a slogan, is putting the cart before 
the horse. Japan's tax rate for direct tax is still low. The 
main point of tax system reform should be placed on increasing 
the rate of income tax which is captured, which up till now was 
merely a dream. What we need for that purpose is introduction of 
a system of taxpayer ID numbers. 
<H5>  Japan's Income Tax Rates Are Still Low </H5>
  In the tax system debate that is currently going on, it is 
taken as a premise that increasing the consumption tax is 
obvious as a long-term reform of the tax system. What has been 
used as grounds for this is the concept "correcting the 
direct-indirect ratio." The direct-indirect ratio is low in 
developing countries and highest in the most advanced countries, 
such as Japan and the United States. This means they seek to 
lower Japan's direct-indirect ratio to a level equal to that of 
Europe, which is in the middle. Everyone thinks that if there is 
no margin for raising income tax above what it is now, an 
increase in the consumption tax may be unavoidable. 
  But what is helpful in judging whether the rate of income 
tax 
is too high is not the direct-indirect ratio; it is 
international comparison of the income tax rate, itself. Let us 
assume that Japan's rate of income tax is the highest from the 
viewpoint of international comparison. Even in such a case, it 
would not mean that the view that there is no margin for raising 
the income tax rate higher than this would have great persuasive 
force, but it would at least be necessary to listen attentively 
to that view. Conversely, if Japan's income tax rate is low 
compared with foreign countries, one could say that, from the 
viewpoint of international comparison there is margin for 
raising it, however high the direct-indirect ratio might be. 
  The graph [not reproduced] shows the ratio of personal 
income 
tax to GDP [gross domestic product] for the advanced countries 
of the OECD. As is clear from the graph, Japan's tax rate is 
strikingly low. It is second from the bottom after France. 
Japan's tax rate is 7.6 percent; Denmark's is 26 percent. 
Consequently, Japan's income tax rate is still very low, so 
there is margin for raising it greatly in the future. 
  The doubt may arise that, although this is the case on 
average, Japan's income tax rate for workers is high when their 
income exceeds 10 million yen. But, in contrast to Japan's 
effective tax rate of 14 percent on income of 10 million yen, it 
is 23 percent in the United States, and in England it is about 
27 percent. Actually, compared with the United States, Japan's 
tax rate for incomes of 19 million yen and below is lower 
(calculated at a rate of 107 yen to the dollar). Compared with 
England, Japan's effective tax rate is lower on incomes up to 
about 25 million yen. Japan's income tax rate is this low even 
when compared with the United States and England, where 
flattening out of income tax by Reagan and Thatcher was carried 
out. 
  When debating whether Japan's income tax rate can be raised 
above this, let us decide soon to stop fraudulently substituting 
the direct-indirect ratio for the problem, and grasp the fact 
that the income tax that we are paying is uncommonly low. 
<H5>  Progressive Income Tax Is an "Insurance System" </H5>
  The object of taxes is not just to pay for government 
finances. The income-redistribution function is also important. 
People are getting different incomes based on effort, talentm 
and luck. Many people are making a living by their own efforts, 
but their incomes differ greatly depending on talent and luck. 
  If we compare persons, now 50 years old, who are employed in 
steel companies with those employed in banks, the salary of one 
is probably about twice that of the other. About 30 years ago, 
when they got their jobs, the dynamic persons who were the cream 
of the cream joined the steel company. Nevertheless, now their 
incomes amount to only one-half that of the bank employees, 
whose only merit is steadiness. In this way, people's lifetime 
incomes end up differing greatly because of the success or 
failure of the industry in which they happened to obtain 
employment. Even within the same industry, for instance even in 
the case of newspaper companies, one hears that there are some 
examples in which salaries differ by 100 percent depending on a 
company's good or bad luck. 
  An important role performed by a progressive income tax is 
that, in such a case, fortunate persons, who happened to obtain 
employment in an industry or company that continues to expand, 
share part of their good fortune with persons whose luck was bad. 
  Furthermore, of course, such persons as author Jiro Akagawa, 
baseball's Hiromitsu Ochiai and Joji Tokoro strive hard, but 
they are getting high incomes more because they happened to be 
born overflowing with talent. It is also thanks to the 
progressive income tax that persons who were born blessed with 
talent pay part of their high incomes as tax, so that it is 
possible to lower by that much the tax rate of us ordinary 
people, who are working hard night and day but are not blessed 
with talent. 
  We do not know what kind of talent and luck our children and 
grandchildren will have at birth. We can consider that the 
progressive income tax by which they are forced to pay high tax 
when everything goes well and they are born with talent, and 
they gain employment in a fortunate company and have reached the 
point of being able to have an affluent life, is insurance for a 
time when things did not go well. 
  There are all sorts of risks in living in a liberal society. 
However astute one may be, there is a limit to judging the 
future of one's own company or industry. One can consider a 
progressive income tax to be an insurance system for that 
purpose. 
<H5>  Opponents of a System of Taxpayer ID Numbers </H5>
  Japan's income tax rate is uncommonly low compared with all 
countries. Why did the authorities decide, nevertheless, that, 
unlike foreign countries, Japan alone must be satisfied with a 
low income tax rate? Furthermore, what was the occasion which 
decided the course of raising the rate on the consumption tax, 
which does not have the function of income redistribution, and 
lowering the income tax rate? 
  It was when the green card system collapsed. After that, the 
Ministry of Finance quickly revised the orbit, the direction of 
which, up till now, had been the taxing of assets, and shifted 
its positon to a policy of seriously carrying out introduction 
of a large indirect tax, which ultimately came to fruition as 
the consumption tax. There is much which escapes taxation with 
the income tax, and it has reached a situation in which 
government throws up its hands in defeat, and because of the 
failure of the green card system it was probably judged to be 
politically impossible to correct this situation. It worked out 
that if they could not correct the escape of taxes which should 
be obtained, they would introduce a consumption tax which 
everyone would pay without escape. 
  There are two types of escape from taxation. The first is 
escape in asset income tax and asset tax. The system of taxpayer 
ID numbers which is employed in such places as the United 
States, Canada, Australia, and the countries of northern Europe 
is indispensible for the purpose of preventing this escape. The 
second, called 9-6-4, is the low rate of capture for the income 
of farmers and the self-employed. But this, too, can be improved 
greatly by an accurate grasp of assets. If assets increase it is 
also clear that there existed income that was its source. 
Moreover, if, as in the United States, transactions are done 
mainly by check rather than by cash, a number is registered on 
the checking account, so it becomes difficult to hide the income 
itself. 
  Consequently, at the stage before introducing an income tax, 
the authorities had to select one of these two options as a 
measure against income escaping taxation. One of them was to 
introduce a system of taxpayer ID numbers, grasp income 
accurately, and change to a tax system centered on income tax. 
The other was to choose "defeatism." In other words, it was to 
give up on grasping income and switch to a tax system centered 
on consumption tax, which does not have the function of 
redistributing income. 
  But introduction of a system of taxpayer ID numbers means 
exposing clearly to the eyes of tax authorities the financial 
asset transactions of all persons. This was a troublesome matter 
to conservative party politicians. Firstly, the holding of 
financial assets by the politicians, themselves, would end up 
becoming clear to the tax authorities. If that happened, it 
would become very difficult to conceal it if they had 
bribery-type income that they wanted to keep secret. Second, it 
would become easy to discover the state of stock trading by 
politicians using the government's inside information. Because 
if there were a person who was always profiting abnormally by 
stock to the extent that it could not be explained as a 
coincidence when viewed in terms of mathematical statistics, one 
would discover it by collecting information for each taxpayer ID 
number, and the investigation of insider trading would begin 
from there. 
  Third, if we ban making political contributions by cash, and 
arrange it so that they are made only by check, it will become 
impossible for contributors to invent expenditures which are 
unaccounted for. A number is registered on the checking account, 
so it means one cannot have an account in a false name. 
Political contributions will end up being in full view of the 
public. 
  This was something that ruling party politicians wanted to 
avoid by all means. This is symbolized by the fact that the one 
who urged destruction of the green card system was none other 
than Shin Kanemaru. Michio Watanabe, who was minister of finance 
when the consumption tax debate began, stated that "those who 
advocate introducing a system of taxpayer ID numbers have 
schoolgirlish tastes." The feeling of conservative party 
politicians toward taxpayer numbers is also expressed well in 
that statement. 
  In other words, the choice between a consumption tax and a 
system of taxpayer ID numbers was also a matter of judging 
whether or not one could eradicate politicians' corruption. 
Under the political conditions at the time, the government and 
the ruling party decided to preserve corruption as something 
natural, so under Prime Minister Takeshita the consumption tax 
was introduced. 
<H5>  Why Is a Number System Necessary? </H5>
  The real reason why the conservative government feared a 
system of taxpayer ID numbers has now become clear to everyone's 
eyes. Most of Japan's governors are afraid of being arrested for 
bribery by general contractors, and the actual situation that 
contributions through the covernors flowed from the provinces 
and were collected by leading politicians of the central 
government is also becoming clear. The decisively important 
system for changing this structure of money-government 
corruption is the introduction of taxpayer ID numbers. Unless we 
introduce this system, it will be impossible to make 
politicians' financial assets and transactions clear to the 
public no matter what kind of election system reforms are 
carried out. 
  Introduction of an ID number system would also protect 
Japan's income tax-centered tax system. Introduction of an ID 
number system would also improve the tax system in the following 
points in addition to those listed up till now. 
  First, it would make it easier to levy a tax on profit from 
transfer of stocks and bonds. In Japan, transfer profit obtained 
from the purchase or sale of stocks and bonds is practically tax 
exempt. A tax is levied on presumed profit from transfer, but 
this is about the same as a transaction tax. How unfair it is 
that the profit from transfer of stocks or bonds obtained by a 
millionaire is not taxed, in spite of the fact that the interest 
of persons with savings accounts are taxed, however small the 
account. It is necessary to newly establish a tax on profit from 
transfer of stocks and bonds, and to levy it at the same rate as 
the tax on savings-account interest. 
  Second, introduction of taxpayer ID numbers is indispensible 
in order to eliminate avoidance of inheritance tax. Inheritance 
tax is the most important tax system for the purpose of 
maintaining fairness of distribution. But in the present 
situation, one does not know accurately who has how much stock, 
so it is judged that there is considerable tax evasion in the 
inheritance of stock. If a list is made of all financial assets 
by means of a number, it will be possible to prevent this kind 
of evasion of inheritance tax. 
  The third concerns taxing of pensions. When one considers 
government financing of pensions, it is wasteful for wealthy 
people to receive pensions exempt from taxes. Yet if one levies 
a tax on pensions, a new injustice occurs. Because in the 
present situation, in which the assets income of old people is 
not accurately known, there appear many old people who, although 
they really have a high asset income, escape being taxed, as 
persons whose total income, including pension, is below the 
tax-exempt point. An accurate knowledge of asset income by 
taxpayer ID numbers would also be helpful from this point. 
  An ID number system is also necessary for redistribution in 
the aspect of annual expenditure. For example, it has been 
pointed out for a long time that scholarships from scholarship 
societies go to the children of farmers and the self-employed, 
who ride around in foreign cars, but that children of salaried 
workers cannot get them. It is said that also among the 
residents of Osaka's public housing designed for low-income 
persons, there are few salaried workers and many persons who are 
self-employed. These phenomena have arisen because it has become 
impossible to judge who really has a low income, because 90 
percent of salaried income is known, but only 60 percent of 
self-employed income and 40 percent of agricultural income. 
  By being able to more accurately account for the entire 
income of each individual, it will become clear who really has a 
low income, so by this means the income-limit conditions for 
such things as social security and scholarships will function 
effectively, and sufficient redistribution of income will be 
made to the necessary people. 
<H5>  Keep Income Tax Reduction to a Minimum </H5>
  The biggest criticism of taxpayer ID numbers is that they 
violate privacy. There are two types of argument, the natures of 
which are completely different. The first is a criticism that 
conservative party politicians like to make: "It will be 
troublesome if the tax authorities stick their hands in 
taxpayers' wallets." 
  But an income tax system cannot be realized if taxpayers can 
hide the content of their income from the tax authorities on the 
grounds of privacy. Anyhow, the income of salaried employees is 
already known completely. The kind of argument given above is no 
different from saying "We would like you to protect preferential 
tax treatment for wealthy persons, and refrain from 
investigating whether politicians have violated the law." 
  The second criticism of violating privacy is that there is a 
possibility that administrative authorities would use for a 
political objective information about a taxpayer's asset income 
which was obtained by introduction of the ID number system. This 
criticism is valid. 
  Actually, unless there are clear preventive measures, there 
is a very strong danger that administrative authorities would 
use tax information for the purpose of entrapping critics and 
persons who became political obstacles. Information related to 
collection of taxes is, by nature, a sword that administrative 
authorities, potentially, can misuse, regardless of whether 
there is an ID number. 
  We, too, must adopt the misuse-prevention measures employed 
by countries that use taxpayer ID numbers, such as the United 
States, Sweden, Australia, and Canada. 
  The policy to lower the income tax rate and raise the 
consumption tax rate in Japan, where the income tax rate is 
strikingly low among advanced countries, is a phenomenon which 
is inseparable from the fact that it was impossible to introduce 
a system of taxpayer ID numbers because of government corruption. 
  Therefore, introduction of taxpayer ID numbers is also an 
indispensible device for eliminating government corruption. It 
will at the same time bring to fruition a tax system centered on 
income tax and without a consumption tax. 
  Now, when the combination of introduction of taxpayer ID 
numbers and a tax system centered on income tax is in sight, 
income tax reduction as a measure for stimulating the economy 
should be kept to a minimum. In particular, we should not lower 
the highest tax rate. This is a trump card which we must save 
carefully for now as payment for introduction of a system of ID 
numbers.

<F P=106> [By Correspondent Liu Zhenyan from Phuket] </F>
  [Excerpts] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui, accompanied by 
his wife and a 40-member delegation, arrived in Phuket on 
Valentine's Day. [passage omitted] 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, in his personal 
capacity, hosted a party for the Taiwan president and his 
delegation at the Dusit Laguna Hotel last night. Chen Youhan 
[Thai name: Chatri Sophonphanit; president of the Bangkok 
Bank], Hu Yulin [Thai Name: Saman Ophatwong; chairman of the 
Thai Rice Exporters Association], Li Guanglong [Thai Name: 
Wisit Lilasithon; chairman of the Wall Street Finance &amp; 
Securities Company and the Wall Street Tower], and Chen Zhuohao 
[Thai name: Sumit Loetsumit; chairman of the board of directors 
of the Si Thai Superware Company] were among the Thai-Chinese 
businessmen invited to attend the banquet. 
  An informed source told our correspondent that Li Teng-hui's 
visit resulted from mediation by Gu Liansong, who has close 
relations with the Thai-Chinese business community and once was 
chairman of the Taiwan-Thai Business Committee and advisor to 
Taiwan's Executive Branch. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai met President Li while 
attending 
an international monetary meeting in Taiwan late last year. 
Yesterday's meeting was the second between Amnuai and Li 
Teng-hui in seven months. 
  Meanwhile, a Chinese National People's Congress [NPC] 
delegation led by Zhu Liang, chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs 
Committee, may delay or cancel its visit to Thailand as a result 
of Li Teng-hui's visit. The delegation is scheduled to visit 
Thailand at the end of this month at the invitation of 
Parliament President Marut Bunnak.

  [Text] Kroekkrai Chiraphaet, director general of the 
Business Economic Department, has commented on the first APEC 
[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] Senior Officials Meeting 
[SOM] -- as well as the Committee on Trade and Investment 
meeting -- held in Jakarta between 31 January and 4 February. 
  According to him, officials placed emphasis on small and 
medium enterprises, which are under the APEC umbrella. Relevant 
working groups and committee were told to emphasize these 
because APEC believes they will contribute to the economic 
development of its members, especially regarding regional 
distribution of income. Consideration, however, must be given 
to enterprises that really respond to the needs of each country. 
  With the conclusion of the GATT talks, the APEC group 
pursued 
its call for liberalization within the grouping. Thailand must 
plan ahead for five years from now and must adapt, because 
Thailand will have to remain with APEC whether it likes it or 
not. 
  Withun Tulayanon, the department's expert on regional trade 
who also attended the Jakarta SOM, said the meeting tasked 
Indonesia with preparing for an informal APEC trade ministers 
meeting during the next GATT meeting, which will be held in 
Morocco. This meeting will allow ministers to exchange views 
prior to the next APEC meeting, which is scheduled for Seattle 
[as published]. 
  He said that during the SOM, U.S. officials circulated 
copies 
of a paper on work that APEC should pursue that was adopted at 
APEC's Blake Island summit late last year. President Bill 
Clinton signed the paper. It was handed to Indonesian President 
Suharto, who will host this year's APEC meeting. The paper said 
it was agreed at Blake Island that an APEC investment code 
[preceding two words in English] should be drafted in 1994. The 
senior officials were surprised when they read the paper. 
Member countries agreed in principle at the summit to draw up 
an investment code, because this will facilitate the flow of 
capital within the grouping. There was no indication, however, 
that the move should be carried out this year. 
  Withun said that such a proposal had already been made to 
APEC in 1993 by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) 
[preceding four words and acronym in English]. Under this 
proposal, investing countries would be given national treatment 
[preceding two words in English], which is even better than most 
favored nation status (MFN). There was also a prohibition 
against quotas on the use of local raw materials. The proposal 
was not supported by most members, and was finally rejected. 
  Many countries expressed surprise after reading the paper 
presented to the SOM. Many disagreed with its contents. Thai 
Board of Investment officials present also disagreed. The 
meeting decided that the issue should first be discussed by 
investment specialists from member countries scheduled to meet 
in the United States at some point. Thailand will send Board of 
Investment officials to attend. 
  According to a Commerce Ministry source, the United States 
pressed for a discussion of the investment code during the SOM. 
An early resolution of this matter would benefit the United 
States, particularly if it concerns the liberalization of 
foreign investment in the service sector, such as airlines, 
tourism, and banking. 
  Singapore and Hong Kong also support the move to speed up 
discussion of the investment code. As duty free ports, they 
both stand to benefit. Japan partially supports the move, but 
has reservations concerning telecommunications. Australia 
supports it. Thailand, Indonesia, China, and some other 
countries disagree with it. This includes Korea, which has 
never allowed foreign investment in its oil industry. 
  Anyway, it is possible that there was no mention in the APEC 
statement about concluding the investment code this year. Those 
who attended the SOM will have to report to Deputy Prime 
Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak and check with him as to 
whether there was any agreement at the APEC summit about a 
deadline for drawing up the investment code. The deputy prime 
minister attended the summit. 
  Withun also described the meeting of the Committee on Trade 
and Investment, which is a permanent mechanism of APEC, 
established under the International Charter on Trade and 
Investment adopted at the 5th APEC ministerial meeting in 
November 1993. The meeting agreed to speed up work on the 
following three issues: 1) product origin; 2) mechanism for 
settling disputes; and 3) policy on competition. APEC will 
attempt to push the first two issues on the GATT meeting's 
agenda. New Zealand has been asked to work on the third issue 
and develop a more precise definition. New Zealand made the 
proposal.

  [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Chaloemphon Sanitwongchai 
disclosed that the Commerce Ministry and Insurance Department 
have not yet come up with a resolution on the proposal to 
increase the number of insurance companies nationwide. In 
principle, the more companies, the more the people benefit 
because they will have more choices. 
  Chaloemphon said: "The business' present image is not very 
good because certain companies still exploit clients. 
Liberalization will trigger competition and prevent 
maltreatment of clients." 
  The deputy minister, however, reaffirmed that if it is 
decided that more insurance companies will be allowed to 
operate, application screening will be carried out in accordance 
with regulations. He said: "I can assure you that issuing 
permits must be done in a fair manner to all. If not, I will be 
the first to defend the interests of the people." 
  He noted that although liberalization of the insurance 
business to open the door for foreign firms is necessary, 
existing Thai insurance companies need time to improve so they 
will be able to compete with foreign companies. 
  He said: "I believe that Thai companies are not yet ready 
for competition and the government is taking necessary actions 
to defend their business as long as possible. They must make 
efforts to improve and should not only think of relying on 
government assistance."

arrest, at her residence on University Avenue Road at 1000. Mr. 
Jehan Raheem, resident representative of the United Nations 
Development Program, was also present at the meeting.

  [Excerpts] A Myanmar [Burma] goodwill delegation led by 
Rail Transportation Minister U Win Sein arrived in Dkaka by air 
on 7 February at the invitation of Bangladesh Communications 
Minister Oli Ahmed. 
  In the evening, Minister Oli Ahmed hosted a dinner for the 
Myanmar delegation in the special reception hall of Dhaka's 
(Kumitola) Golf Resort. 
  On the morning of 8 February, the Myanmar delegation called 
on Bangladesh President Abdur Rahman Biswas. The Bangladesh 
president extended his best wishes to Senior General Than Shwe, 
chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], 
and spoke cordially and frankly on the need for greater 
cooperation to improve existing bilateral relations. On behalf 
of SLORC Chairman Senior General Than Shwe, Minister U Win Sein 
wished the president best wishes and stressed his desire to 
improve bilateral economic relations while upholding the 
existing good and friendly bilateral relations. [passage omitted] 
  The Myanmar delegation visited and donated saffron robes and 
other items to the (Athtavmeda) Myanmar Monastery in Cox Bazar 
on the morning of 9 February, and to the Chittagong Buddhist 
Monastery in the evening. The delegation then left Chittagong 
by train and arrived back in Dhaka on the morning of 10 February. 
  The Myanmar delegation called on Bangladesh Foreign Minister 
Mustafizur Rahman in Dhaka. At the meeting, Minister U Win Sein 
expressed his gratitude for the Myanmar delegation's tour of 
Dhaka, Chittagong, and Cox Bazar on its first visit to 
Bangladesh. He also expressed his satisfaction at studying 
developments in agriculture and forest conservation and the 
renovation and expansion of highways in Bangladesh. He 
explained future investment prospects, including joint ventures 
in the field of bilateral trade. U Win Sein explained that 
bilateral visits by leaders of both countries will lead to 
better understanding and goodwill and will decrease and reduce 
problems. He expressed his belief that bilateral relations 
should involve all administrative levels, to facilitate easy and 
quick coordination, rather than involving only routine 
diplomatic channels. He also expressed his thanks for the 
invitation to visit Bangladesh, and thanked his host for the 
hospitality. 
  The Bangladesh foreign minister expressed his happiness with 
the success of the Myanmar delegation's visit, and noted that 
bilateral cooperation between Myanmar and Bangladesh should be a 
model of good neighborliness. He also expressed his desire for 
greater South-South cooperation. The minister explained that 
Bangladesh should be regarded as a country that desires better 
bilateral relations, and as a good friend that wants to see 
Myanmar develop.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 5 (ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas Tuesday that it is not unusual for the international 
media to raise stories on East Timor ahead of the United Nations 
Commission on Human Rights Convention in Geneva. "These 
sensational news stories are aimed at attracting world attention 
on East Timor," he told the press after accompanying the 
visiting German state minister of foreign affairs, Ursula Seiler 
Albring, to a courtesy call on President Suharto. 
  The Australian SYDNEY MORNING HERALD recently published a 
report of an "Orgy of Killing" in East Timor following what came 
to be called the "Dili incident." The daily was quoting a BBC 
documentary producer whose original footage of the Dili incident 
helped incite international condemnation on Indonesia's 
treatment of its youngest province. The British Broadcasting 
Corporation film maker said he had lived illegally in East Timor 
for 3 months. On that claim, Alatas said: "Without our notice, 
it would be very impossible for him to stay there for almost 
three months." When asked about a foreign journalist's 
application to produce a film in the province, Alatas said his 
ministry was still considering the request. 
  On the occasion, the minister also disclosed his plans to 
visit Myanmar [Burma] and Laos at the invitation of the two 
countries. 
  He said his visit to Myanmar was aimed at finding out the 
latest development in the country, including discussing matters 
for the next Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 
ministerial meeting. 
  Commenting on China's protest over the recent "vacation 
visit" of Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui to Bali, Alatas said 
no other official protests were lodged after the end of Li's 
stay. He reiterated Indonesia's "one-China policy" and said that 
Jakarta recognised only mainland China as a nation and state. He 
stressed that ties between Indonesia and Taiwan were maintained 
at economic and trade level.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Feb. 14 (ANTARA) -- Taiwan and 
Indonesia will soon explore the possibility of establishing 
cooperation in manufacturing non-military aeroplanes, said 
Research and Technology Minister B.J. Habibie here Monday. 
  "Taiwan has no experience in producing such type of 
aeroplane, so that it would like to learn from Indonesia which 
has 18 years of experience in non-military aircraft production," 
he told the press after meeting with Germany's junior minister, 
Ursula Seiler Albring, of the German Foreign Ministry. [passage 
omitted] 
  Habibie quoted Taiwan President Li Teng-hui as saying that 
Taiwan would like to learn from Indonesia in manufacturing 
non-military aeroplanes in line with the country's effort in 
demilitarization. [passage omitted] 
  At the meeting, Habibie urged Taiwan to increase its 
investment in Indonesia. Taiwan's direct investment in Indonesia 
in 1993 was recorded only at U.S. $124.6 million or a sharp 
decrease from U.S. $1.06 billion in 1991. "Taiwan pledged to 
muster its enterpreneurs and business sector to invest in 
Indonesia," he added. Habibie, who made clear that he met the 
Taiwan president in his capacity as a scientist, said that he 
learned much about issues on village development from President 
Li Teng-hui who is an expert in agronomy and village development. 
  "Indonesia would also like to explore the possibility of 
establishing cooperation with Taiwan in the development of 
villages," he said, adding that Taiwan has suceeded in 
industrializing 70 percent of all its villages. We can take, as 
an example, Taiwan's experience that if the villages are 
integrated into the industrialization process of the country, 
the village community will also be able to transform themselves 
into becoming industrial technocrats," he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Berlin, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) opened a working-level 
contact on Tuesday on the issue of nuclear inspection of North 
Korea, sources at IAEA said. The sources said North Korea asked 
IAEA on Tuesday morning to have working-level contact. It was 
the first contact between North Korea and IAEA in 20 days after 
their last contact took place on last Jan. 25. 
  Officials of the North Korean Embassy in Vienna carried 
instructions from Pyongyang to the talks, the source said. But, 
no contents of the Pyongyang instructions were immediately 
known. In this connection, IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said that 
at the moment he could not confirm nor deny the resumption of 
the contact.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will soon resume talks 
that deadlocked over the scope of nuclear inspections last 
month, informed sources in Washington said Tuesday. North Korea 
has notified the United States of its wish to resume last-minute 
talks with the IAEA as the Feb. 21 opening of the agency's 
board meeting nears, the sources said, predicting a breakthrough 
in the disagreement over nuclear inspections. 
  Previous talks went nowhere as North Korea flatly opposed 
full-scale inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites while 
insisting on limited inspection of the secretive reprocessing 
facility and reactor at Yongbyon. The North Koreans may show 
more flexibility on allowing inspections in this round of 
negotiations, the sources said. 
  Pyongyang, informing Washington of its intention to resume 
talks with the IAEA at a recent unofficial meeting, urged the 
United States to keep its promise to hold a third round of 
high-level negotiations to discuss suspension of the annual 
military exercise "Team Spirit" with South Korea and improving 
bilateral ties. The sources said Pyongyang and Washington have 
narrowed their differences over nuclear inspections a great 
deal, but did not elaborate. 
  There is a possibility that North Korea may accept 
full-scale 
nuclear inspections by attaching a number of conditions, but it 
is uncertain whether it will use that card before the IAEA board 
meeting or before the end of the month, when the North Korean 
nuclear matter will likely be referred to the U.N. Security 
Council if there is no progress on inspections. 
  After six rounds of unsuccessful talks, North Korea has 
shunned the IAEA since Jan. 25, accusing the U.N. nuclear 
watchdog of trying to force complete inspections. 
  It remains uncertain whether Pyongyang will resume talks 
with 
the IAEA and working-level contacts with the United States in 
New York at the same time.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korea 
may hold a high-level meeting here around Feb. 21 in order to 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, a Western diplomatic 
source said Monday. 
  "Ambassadors Hwang Pyong-tae of South Korea and Chu 
Chang-chon of North Korea nearly met here through arrangements 
made by an influential ethnic Korean living in Beijing last 
November when negotiations between the United States and North 
Korea were making hardly any progress," the diplomat said. That 
meeting failed to take place, he said, but chances that the two 
Koreas will get together behind the scenes are bright because of 
recent developments, the diplomat said, asking for anonymity. 
  The United States has said it will refer the matter to the 
U.N. Security Council unless North Korea and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reach agreement on inspections 
before the IAEA convenes a Board of Governors' meeting on Feb. 
21. 
  According to the source, the South Korean Embassy here 
received a proposal from the North Korean Embassy in a 
councilor-level contact urging that they arrange a Hwang-Chu 
meeting. 
  The South Korean Embassy has studied the proposal but 
withheld any decision because North Korea was already in contact 
secretly with the United States in New York and because the 
timing was wrong, the diplomat said. In addition, the two Koreas 
have an existing channel for such contacts, he added. 
  The source said, however, a view is gaining strength within 
the South Korean Government that Seoul must determine 
Pyongyang's true nuclear intentions as its talks with the United 
States and the IAEA appear to have reached their limit. 
  Besides, South Korea must know the North's position on the 
issue because President Kim Yong-sam is expected to discuss it 
at a summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin when he visits 
China in March, the source said. Consequently, there is a 
strong possibility that Hwang and Chu will hold a secret meeting 
in Beijing in the near future, the source said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 15 February 
carry articles discussing the North Korean stance in connection 
with its nuclear issue with the 21 February International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors meeting approaching, 
which reportedly would lead to referring the issue to the UN 
Security Council and then to sanctions on North Korea by the UN 
Security Council. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO on 15 February carries on page 
4 
a 1,000-word article by Ottawa-based correspondent Pak Tu-sik 
entitled "North Korean Nuclear Issue Heading for the UN Security 
Council--China and Japan Openly Revealing Their Intention of 
Seeking Practical Profit." The article refers to the remark 
made by Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa at the U.S.-Japanese 
summit talks held in Washington on 11 February. He is quoted as 
saying: "If the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN 
Security Council, Japan will cooperate with the United Nations 
within the scope that our local laws permit." The article notes 
that Japan's attitude in attaching a string to the issue 
suggests that Japan is seeking a reward for its cooperation with 
the United Nations in dealing with the North Korean nuclear 
issue. The article then notes the Chinese position of delaying 
the UN Security Council's moves toward resolving the North 
Korean nuclear issue and says, "China makes it clear that China 
does not want the UN Security Council to take up the issue 
directly. China may not want the North Korean nuclear issue to 
be referred to the United Nations, which may well create a 
crisis near China and expose the Chinese position to the 
judgment of the international arena. Meanwhile, it is also true 
that China regards the present situation as a golden opportunity 
to expand its influence on the Sino-U.S. relations and on the 
Korean peninsula." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 2 a 
600-word article dispatched by reporter Chong Pyong-chin from 
Washington in the "Reporter's Eye" column entitled "Facsimile 
Dispatched by Ho Chong." The article notes two different pieces 
of North Korean reactions reaching the ROK Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu's Washington field camp dealing with the North Korean 
nuclear issue around noon on 13 February [EST], one being the 
North Korean NODONG SINMUN and Central Broadcast's bellicose 
warning "We will regard any sanctions and pressure on Korea as 
an act of war provocation," and the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman's negotiation-seeking comment "The U.S. 
Government should make clear its correct position toward the 
third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks." The article notes that Ho 
Chong, North Korean representative to the United Nations, sent 
facsimile of the latter, namely, the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman's comment, to the news agencies and even to 
the residences of correspondents from around the world in 
Washington. The article notes that North Korea did not show 
such a kindness for the former, namely, the NODONG SINMUN and 
the Central Broadcast's warning. The article concludes, "We may 
be able to discern the North Korean `nuclear strategy' from the 
behavior of the North Korean UN mission distributing door to 
door the `proposal aimed at negotiation,' instead of the 
`warning,' with the deadline for the UN Security Council 
decision on sanctions approaching only several days away, timing 
it with the ROK foreign minister's visit to the United States." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 5 a 
1,300-word article by Ottawa-based correspondent Chong 
Pyong-chin entitled "What Is the True Intent of the North Korean 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman's Comment--North Korea Tries To Get 
Open Confirmation of Its Behind-the-Scenes Agreement With the 
United States." The article notes the meaning of the North 
Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's comment issued on 12 
February and says: "the ROK and the United States regard it as 
the North Korean proposal that the United States confirm the 
secretive and intermittent exchange of views between the United 
States and North Korea." The article goes on to note the 
remarks by an ROK Government official who accompanied Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu on his visit to the United States, who is 
quoted as saying: "We think that North Korea openly asked for 
the card which the ROK and the United States was going to 
present. This seems to be the North Korean intention of leading 
the situation positively rather than negatively." The article 
then notes, "North Korea is, in fact, asking the United States 
to help North Korea establish its justification for its own 
people at home, in allowing the IAEA inspection team to visit 
North Korea, that the inspection team could come to North Korea 
because of its own good will" rather than being forced by the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty obligations. The article also 
notes that North Korea wants to have the U.S.-North Korean 
behind-the-scenes exchange of views notarized so that it can 
secure the anticipated fruits if the third round of U.S.-North 
Korean talks are held." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 5 a 
900- word article by reporter Yu Sung-u entitled "Why Is North 
Korea So Indecisive Between Hardline and Dialogue?--Hardline and 
Moderate Negotiation Strategy Utilizing Time Before 
International Sanctions." The article notes the background 
behind North Korea's sending two different messages one after 
the other in connection with its nuclear issue, that is, while 
it maintained a stiff stance for some time on the nuclear 
inspection by the IAEA, North Korea hinted on the possibility of 
resolving the issue through dialogue at the last minute. The 
article notes, "Some North Korean watchers believe that North 
Korea takes this position because it thinks there is still some 
time left before actual sanctions are taken." The article then 
notes the opinion of another group of watchers that says that 
"North Korean President Kim Il-song may have tentatively taken 
back the authority on diplomacy and economy from his son Kim 
Chong-il to institute the authority himself. This may have 
caused the issuance of the apparently conflicting messages." 
The article notes the opinion of yet another group of watchers 
that says "North Korea is trying to fully use the time before 
the actual sanctions are taken," because it could still use the 
double tactic of negotiation of hawk and dove before the 
sanctions can actually produce effects. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 4 an 800-word 
article entitled "The Last U.S. Persuasion To the North" by 
correspondent Nam Chan-sun from Washington. 
  The article reports that the United States is making its 
final persuasive move through the North Korean mission in the 
United Nations and the PRC is also doing everything possible to 
join the effort to persuade North Korea. The article reports 
that such persuasive efforts are based on the analysis that 
North Korea values the clue for dialogue [taehwaui pulssi] as 
has been revealed through the remarks of a North Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman on 12 February. 
  The article notes the fact that most conditions except one 
or 
two were agreed upon between North Korea and the IAEA and that 
the ROK foreign minister's "appeal" during his recent U.S. visit 
encouraged the United States to continue to be persuasive. 
  The article notes that "the persuasion does not mean any 
more 
concession but is focused on having North Korea realize the 
situation after the nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security 
Council." 
  The article reports that the ROK Government is criticized 
for 
having weakened the "stick character" of the persuasion by 
announcing that it will continue dialogue with Pyongyang even 
after the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN 
Security Council. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 4 a 
1,200-word article by correspondent Yang Sung-hyon from Ottawa. 
  Comparing the two communications made by North Korea on 12 
February--the hardline toned NODONG SINMUN commentary and the 
moderate remarks of a Foreign Ministry spokesman--the article 
reports that the government analyzes the former as "for domestic 
use" targeting the hard-liners and public opinion inside North 
Korea, and the latter as a message to the international 
community. 
  The article analyzes that "ROK Foreign Minister Han's visit 
to the United States provided North Korea with a pretext for 
changing its direction" and adds that government officials 
believe there is a great possibility that North Korean 
working-level officials reported such moves of the ROK and the 
United States as an "achievement of the Republic's demand." 
  The article notes that it is still too early to be 
optimistic 
because the United State and the IAEA have yet to assess North 
Korea's true intentions and North Korea has to confirm with the 
IAEA if the IAEA's expression of "inspections for the continuity 
of safeguards" coincides with North Korea's demands. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
700-word 
entitled "Attention on North Korea's Last Nuclear Card" by 
correspondent Yi Sung-chol from Ottawa. 
  The article notes that ROK and U.S. officials agree that 
North Korea will soon suggest the resumption of dialogue with 
the United States and that the attention is focused on when and 
what the contents will be. 
  The article quotes an ROK Government official as saying: 
"Analyzing the 12 February remarks of the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, North Korea is focusing on facilitating 
pretexts rather than insisting on their demands." 
  The article reports the official also added that North Korea 
has finally realized that it is impossible for the United States 
to pressure IAEA more to ease inspection conditions. 
  The article reports the ROK and U.S. authorities are 
discussing the optimum level of pretexts available to the 
expected demands from North Korea. 
  As to the timing, the article reports that related officials 
expect North Korea will request the United States to hold a 
dialogue on 19 February at the latest and that a high-ranking 
ROK Government official expects that the IAEA's resolution to 
refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council 
will be adopted on 23 February. 
  The article reports the ROK and U.S. Governments are 
studying 
countermeasures based on three assumptions before 19 February: 
First, when North Korea expresses its willingness to accept 
nuclear inspections; Second, when the nuclear inspections begin; 
Third, when no agreement is reached. 
  The article reports that an ROK Government authority said if 
North Korea agrees to accept nuclear inspection, there is a 
great possibility that the United Nations will adopt a 
resolution to impose sanctions with a deadline for nuclear 
inspections.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 13 (YONHAP) -- As tension mounts over 
the matter of accepting international nuclear inspections, North 
Korea turned cold on inter-Korean economic cooperation which it 
has previously actively sought through unofficial channels, a 
government official said Sunday. 
  North Korean businessmen have lost interest in contacting 
their South Korean partners this year and instead are turning to 
American or Japanese firms to pursue joint-venture projects, the 
official said. 
  The change in their position is understood to be in 
connection with the dismissal of reform-minded Kim Tal-hyon as a 
vice premier and chairman of State Planning Commission and the 
mounting tension over the nuclear issue, the official said. 
  South and North Korean businessmen have continued their 
contacts in Beijing even when the nuclear problem became an 
international issue, he said, but the North is making no efforts 
this year. 
  Pyongyang is also very cold on allowing South Korean 
companies taking part in its infrastructure projects and instead 
is seeking partnership with U.S. or Japanese firms, he said. 
  Kim of North Korea reportedly met with Samsung, 
Lucky-Goldstar, Daewoo leaders in December 1992 and asked for 
their participation in Pyongyang's economic development projects.

  [Summary] North Korea has reportedly requested that ROK 
businesses invest capital into the development of Port Chongjin 
and is preparing for increased North-South trade by opening, 
within this year, a sea route between Chongjin and Pusan that is 
to serve twice a week. 
  According to authorities concerned on 14 February, Chairman 
Li Tiehu of the Xianhu business group of Jilin Province, China, 
visited the ROK in early February to discuss this issue and 
conveyed the North Korean authorities' intention that "Rather 
than China or any other country, North Korea is now counting on 
the South Korean side for the necessary funds to develop Port 
Chongjin that is estimated to exceed $100 million," and added 
that "North Korea is gearing up efforts to open sea routes 
between Pusan and Chongjin, and Inchon and Nampo as part of a 
plan to devote all of Chongjin to free economic zones." [Citing 
a Chinese source, Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean on 15 February 
1994 p 7 adds: "North Korea reportedly launched a feasibility 
study on opening Chongjin and Nampo as economic zones" and 
"North Korea once reviewed opening Sinuiju as an economic zone, 
only to withhold a final decision."] 
  Xianhu Business has been learned to have signed an exclusive 
contract with the North Hamgyong Provincial Administrative and 
Economic Committee, and the Economic Cooperation Co. of North 
Korea to build a wharf for containers and cranes, a road 
connecting Chongjin and Horyong, and to expand an open storage 
yard to 237,000 sq. yds.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Chon Taek-won] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that North Korea will open 
Sinuiju and Nampo this year as special economic zones following 
the Sonbong-Najin area, which was opened in December 1991 as a 
free economic and trade zone. This was disclosed on 14 February 
by a Chinese specialist on North Korean affairs who contacted 
North Korean officials concerned in North Korean external 
economic affairs. He added that the residents of the Sinuiju 
area, to be opened as a special economic zone, were relocated 
last year, and that harbor and railroad construction work is now 
underway in this city. 
  The Chinese specialist said: An economic zone with an area 
of 
three square kilometers will be established in Sinuiju, and 
another economic zone with an area of two square kilometers will 
be established in Nampo, respectively. The opening of these two 
cities will be officially announced on 9 September, the day of 
the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean regime, 
after being passed by North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly. 
  The specialist said: "I understand that there was some 
objection to opening up among North Korea's highest leadership, 
but the leadership decided to promote openness in a phased and 
limited manner, believing that it is an inevitable trend of 
history." 
  Stressing that "China has played a great role in leading 
North Korea to openness" the specialist said that "with the 
opening of Sinuiju, the industrial zone linking Dandong, located 
on the opposite side of Sinuiju, and Shenyang, the central city 
of the three northeast provinces of China, is ready to be linked 
with Sinuiju. At the same time, North Korea also attaches great 
importance to the opening of Sinuiju, which will contribute to 
increasing trade with China. 
  The specialist said that a mutual cooperative system has 
already been established between China and North Korea for the 
opening of Sinuiju. Thus, he expressed a strong desire to 
develop, through this cooperative system, a West Sea economic 
sphere including North Korea. 
  The specialist also said that in addition to the 380 
kilometer-long Shenyang-Dalian expressway, a direct 
Shenyang-Dandong expressway is scheduled to open in October and 
that the Shenyang-Fenghuangcheng-Benxi linking railway, which 
was used as the main supply route for the Chinese People's 
Volunteers during the Korean war; the second railway bridge on 
the Yalu River leading to Chongsumyon in North Korea; and other 
roads will be rebuilt to use as routes for transporting 
underground resources. 
  The specialist said that Sinuiju, the second largest city of 
North Korea with a population of 700,000, forms an industrial 
zone in Puksinuiju [north Sinuiju] District, located in the 
city's Yalu River riverside. He said that the depth of the water 
of the present harbor located in the estuary of the Yalu River 
is 20 meters, that the construction work of expanding this 
harbor from the present facilities capable of anchoring only a 
5,000-tonne ship to the facilities capable of anchoring a 
10,000-tonne ship is underway, and that the construction of the 
Sinuiju-Pyongyang railroad and an 8 km-long railway leading to 
the harbor is also being accelerated.

<F P=106> [By Chon Taek-won from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] The opening of Sinuiju means the start of North 
Korea's opening of areas near the West Sea following the opening 
of Najin and Sonbong near the East Sea [Sea of Japan]. The 
development of the economic zone around the Tuman River, which 
finds its way to the East Sea, is still merely a plan without 
any clear prospect for investments although it has been promoted 
by the UNDP [United Nations Development Project]. The Sinuiju 
development plan is, however, likely to be realized soon and 
produce visible results because this area is connected with 
China's West Sea economic zone, which is under a full-scale 
development. This fact draws public attention. People are 
interested, in particular, in the possibility that North Korea 
will partially introduce the Chinese-style opening policy 
because the opening of Sinuiju is going to be promoted in 
relation with China's opening policy. 
  In fact, rumors on the development of Sinuiju began last 
year, and have been popular for a long time among people in 
Dandong, the Chinese city across Sinuiju, at the other side of 
the sea, but there was no way to confirm it. Real facts of the 
rumor began to emerge as North Korea recently set out its 
second-stage opening plan in a full scale. 
  North Korea opened the Najin-Sonbong area on 28 December 
1991 
according to Decree No. 74 of the State Administration Council. 
Thus, the three North Korean ports along the East Sea coast, 
including Chongjin located in this area, are now open. When 
Sinuiju and Nampo open in the second stage, North Korea will 
have open areas in, both, the East and West Sea coasts. 
  In spite of this fact, we could not realize North Korea's 
opening up because of the deadlocked North Korean nuclear issue 
and because of no visible progress in the plan to develop the 
Tuman River area, including Sonbong and Najin, due to the 
contradiction in interests of the countries concerned. 
  Moreover, North Korea has been very cautious of the 
Chinese-style way of opening up based on the socialist market 
economy, and it was hard to believe that North Korea would 
really open the West Sea area -- its opening would inevitably be 
related with China -- under the situation in which relations 
between the two countries became delicate because of the North 
Korean nuclear issue. North Korea, however, could not help but 
seek its way in the changing situation represented by the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and East Europe and China's reform 
and opening up. 
  North Korea finally worked out a "region-lockout opening 
policy [kukchi pyeswoehyong kaebangchaek]" as a means to protect 
its system from the shock caused by the opening up as well as to 
break the economic deadlock. 
  This policy was experimentally applied to the Najin-Sonbong 
area. The policy is aimed at preventing the wind from an open 
area from blowing over to other areas by completely banning the 
people's contacts with open areas and by having unfaithful 
residents in open areas and those in the region neighboring an 
open area move out. 
  North Korea forced residents in the region around Najin and 
Sonbong to move out and replaced some of them, and now is 
reportedly having the residents of Puksinuiju move out. 
  Why has North Korea worked out this opening policy 
internally 
although the nuclear issue, externally, is running into a 
tougher phase? Public interest is focused on this. Some people 
guess that though it assumes a nuclear confrontation policy, 
North Korea is well aware that it has no choice but taking a 
line of peaceful coexistence based on economic exchanges. It 
can be said that the opening of Sonbong, Najin, and five cities 
for border trade with China is nothing but preliminary 
arrangements for the second-stage opening of Sinuiju and Nampo. 
  Sinuiju is as important to North Korea as Pusan is to the 
ROK. This border city competes with China's Dandong and 
Donggou. This city can play a role in beefing up North Korea's 
opening up. This city has abundant hydraulic power (Supung 
power station), abundant water supply, and the railway system, 
and is convenient for maritime and river navigation. 
  A pipeline for oil, which China exceptionally supplies to 
its 
brotherly country [North Korea], runs from the Daqing oil field 
to the Pakchon refinery via a bottom section of the Yalu River 
in front of Sinuiju. Needless to day, Sinuiju's industries, 
including the textile industry, are important to North Korea. 
  China, a world-class base of non-ferrous metals, is 
developing borax, magnesium, talcum, and graphite. Japanese 
trading corporations have so far been making profits by 
re-exporting these minerals to the ROK. Dandong has an 
international airport directly linked to Hong Kong; Shanghai; 
and Beijing; and the Donggou port, where four 40,000-tonne boats 
can berth simultaneously, is nearby. Therefore, Dandong is 
equipped with all conditions for development. 
  Dandong was formerly Andong. A historic irony is that the 
military airport, railway, bridges, and roads which were used 
when the Chinese Army was invading the Korean peninsula are now 
being used for opening North Korea and promoting exchange with 
North Korea. 
  China seems to believe that if it links China's three 
northeastern provinces [Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang] in 
which Shenyang is a central city, Dandong, Dalian, and Donggou 
to Sinuiju, this will contribute to developing the Yellow Sea 
sphere, unlocking North Korea's economic potential, promoting 
regional economic cooperation with the ROK, and, thus, promoting 
stability on the Korean peninsula. 
  It is presently far from certain that North Korea will 
further open up. Still, indications have appeared that North 
Korea is moving toward carrying out practical economic policies. 
And, the opening of Sinuiju must be assessed in this context.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- U.S. lawmakers on 
Tuesday denied any commercial motives in plans to deploy Patriot 
missiles in South Korea, urging Seoul to look at the political 
meaning of the deployment and the heightened war deterrence. 
  A group of six U.S. representatives, led by John Murtha, 
chairman of the Defense Subcommittee of the House Appropriations 
Committee, met with South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Hong 
Sun-yong to discuss the effectiveness of sanctions against North 
Korea and security on the Korean peninsula, ministry officials 
said. 
  The talks touched on how far Japan and China would go in 
case 
the UN Security Council imposed sanctions against North Korea, 
whether the Tokyo government would be able to halt the money 
flow from pro-Pyongyang Korean residents into North Korea and 
whether Beijing would stop supplying crude oil to its ally. 
  Vice Minister Hong said he expects Beijing to recognize the 
international mood and meet South Korea's expectations. 
  Apparently trying to allay criticism here that Washington is 
taking advantage of the current tension to sell arms to Seoul, 
the congressmen dismissed any commercial interest in the matter, 
the officials said. 
  The Clinton administration's plans to deploy Patriot 
missiles 
at American bases in South Korea, the lawmakers said, are aimed 
at countering North Korean missiles that can reach as far as 
Japan. 
  The Patriot deployment should be understood for its 
"political symbolism," the congressmen were quoted as saying, 
and the missiles' presence would greatly improve deterrence 
against North Korean aggression. 
  The legislators left Tuesday morning, ending a three-day 
visit to Seoul that included meetings with the defense minister 
and presidential aide for diplomacy and national security.

  [Text] Pusan, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The Pusan Coalition for 
Democracy and National Unification on Monday called for the 
retraction of an alleged plan of the United States to build up 
arms in South Korea. The coalition with some progressive-minded 
people in the Pusan area as its members, said in a statement the 
United States should retract an "arms buildup plan" forthwith. 
It said that in the buildup plan, the United States seeks to 
deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters in Korea. 
  "The arms buildup plan stands in the way to a peaceful 
resolution of the North Korean nuclear question," said the 
statement. "It is a conspiracy to heighten tension and thereby 
facilitate the sale of weapons whose overseas markets have been 
obliterated by the advent of the de-Cold War age." 
  The coalition also asked the United States to be more 
sincere 
toward nuclear talks with North Korea and called on the South 
Korean Government to turn down the U.S. plan to deploy modern 
weapons in Korea and to resume the suspended inter-Korean 
dialogue.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- The opposition 
Democratic Party resolved at a caucus on Tuesday to send U.S. 
President Bill Clinton a letter urging a peaceful solution to 
the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  International sanctions against the Stalinist state would 
heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula, the main opposition 
party concluded at the meeting attended by supreme councilors 
and lawmakers belonging to the National Assembly's Defense and 
Foreign Affairs-National Unification Committees. 
  The letter will be delivered to Clinton, via Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, by Rep. Chong Tae-chol when he visits 
Washington later this week. 
  The party also agreed that if sanctions become inevitable 
after the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of 
Governors meeting slated for Feb. 21, they should be taken on a 
step-by-step basis. 
  Spokesman Pak Chi-won said the letter would convey to 
President Clinton the party's hope for fresh efforts to seek a 
peaceful way out, such as a package solution, by calming down 
U.S. hard-liners warning of the danger of war on the Korean 
peninsula.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. State Department 
has notified Seoul that it will take up the question of opening 
the South Korean market for foreign legal service at the third 
round of U.S.-South Korea Dialogue for Economic Cooperation 
(DEC) in Washington on Wednesday, the Justice Ministry said 
Monday. 
  The official letter, sent in the name of the assistant 
secretary of state, said that foreign legal service is needed in 
South Korea in order to protect U.S. interests as an increasing 
number of American companies are investing in Korea, according 
to Justice Ministry officials. 
  Kim Yong-chol, a specialist on international law at the 
Ministry, said, however, that Seoul should tell the U.S. side 
that the market cannot be opened since legal service in Korea, 
which works basically for the benefit of the public rather than 
individuals, has fundamentally different characteristics from 
that of the United States.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- A growing number of 
South Korean firms are being "cheated" in trade with foreign 
companies this year, with the Chinese ranked as the second 
biggest problem after the Americans, the Korean Commercial 
Arbitration Board (KCAB) said Monday. Korean businesses 
reported nine damage claims against foreign companies worth 2.41 
million U.S. dollars last month, up 225 percent in number and 
296.1 percent in value from January last year. 
  In contrast, foreign companies demanded damages in 26 Korean 
cases, off 33.3 percent from a year earlier, worth 1.26 million 
dollars. As trade volume grows and export lines diversify, 
Korean businesses are suffering more damage, a KCAB official 
observed. 
  Another reason for the increase in claims by Korean 
companies 
is their change of attitude in reacting aggressively to 
cut-throat world competition following the conclusion of the 
Uruguay Round pact, the official said. Their trade claims 
reported to the KCAB totaled 106 last year, up 65.6 percent from 
1992, and foreign claims against Korean companies dropped from 
395 to 387. 
  Trade friction with the United States overshadowed that with 
other countries as cases hit 28 last year and nine last month, 
followed by China with 13 last year and four in January. 
  Although China is Korea's third biggest trading partner 
after 
the United States and Japan, Korean companies claim many damages 
because of China's inconsistent trade practices, the official 
said.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is 
positively considering a Russian offer to repay loans totaling 
1.47 billion U.S. dollars in the form of state-of-the-art 
weapons, not in cash, it was learned here on Monday. 
  The Seoul Government, having already examined two lists of 
arms Russia recently offered, has concluded that some would be 
useful in evaluating North Korea's weapons systems because they 
follow those of the former Soviet Union, informed sources here 
said. But Seoul would reject many others on the lists 
considering that its weapons systems are patterned after U.S. 
systems and that it maintains close relations with Washington, 
they added. 
  In response to Russia's proposal, Seoul will shortly send a 
group of weapons specialists to Moscow to study any technical 
problems with the arms and negotiate the terms of receiving them 
in place of the defaulted loans. 
  The Russian Army Chief of General Staff, Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
will visit Seoul in march to meet with Korean defense officials 
to discuss Russia's offer of weapons in payment for outstanding 
loans. 
  Russian Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin said in a 
recent interview with YONHAP that Moscow is ready not only to 
offer many of its state-of-the-art weapons in payment for South 
Korean loans in arrears, but also to introduce Korean capital 
and marketing techniques in privatizing the Russian defense 
industry.

  [Text] The government has set aside $10 million to finance 
rehabilitation projects for the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of 
Jericho, government sources said yesterday. The sources said an 
additional $260,000 will be granted for various training 
programs and donation of equipment to the self-rule government 
of Palestinians this year. 
  The financial support will be studied with the PLO side when 
a legitimate recipient body is set up in the autonomous region, 
the sources said. 
  The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) agreed 
early this month in Jerusalem to provide $25 million to the 
Palestinian Housing Council to build houses for poor families in 
the village of Jabalia in the Gaza Strip. 
  The sources said the government will consult with the PLO 
over which projects the fund will be financed when the 
Palestinian outlet is formed in the autonomous territory. 
  The $10 million will come from the Economic Development and 
Cooperation Fund (EDCF) which is managed by the government to 
help developing nations. 
  The other $260,000 in aid will be used to train 10 
Palestinians in the manufacturing field here, and to send two 
Korean experts and construction equipment there this year. 
  The sources said that set-up of a legitimate body to receive 
the financial support will be speeded up as Israel and the PLO 
signed an agreement in Cairo last Wednesday on security issues, 
including who will monitor the Palestinian border crossing. 
  The Korean embassy in Jordan has been instructed to closely 
watch the development of Palestinian autonomy in connection with 
the aid program, the sources said. The embassy in Jordan 
handles affairs to the PLO with which Korea has no diplomatic 
relations.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to 
expand overseas tours by political, educational and regional 
figures to observe nuclear power plants in an effort to promote 
the plants here, the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said on 
Monday. 
  Ministry officials said that additional construction of 
nuclear power plants in South Korea is inevitable, but that 
recognition of the situation and knowledge of nuclear reactors 
among the general public are inadequate. In a plan to enhance 
such recognition and knowledge, the Ministry will send 210 
people in 17 observation parties to overseas power plants this 
year, compared to 65 in eight parties last year. 
  The Ministry plans to construct 76 power plants including 14 
nuclear plants by 2006 to meet the demand for power, which is 
expected to increase by more than 10 percent yearly into the 
early 21st century. The plan will raise the proportion of 
nuclear power in electricity generation to 47.7 percent in 2006 
from the current 40.3 percent, Ministry officials explained.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition 
Democratic Party [DP] claimed Monday that President Kim 
Yong-sam, who launched a campaign for reform and liquidation of 
authoritarianism a year ago, has run into the wall because his 
policy failed to justify such reform. 
  President Kim's reform has no clear-cut principles and 
targets, said Rep. Kim Pyong-o, chairman of the party's Policy 
Committee, in the DP's evaluation called "the limitations of the 
Kim Yong-sam Administration's reform and 10 acts of misrule." 
  The party listed the following 10 [number as received] types 
of misrule by Kim in the first year of his presidency: 
  Rising consumer prices, failure in the Uruguay Round of 
trade 
negotiations and forced opening of the rice market, negligence 
on the North Korean nuclear issue and a setback in inter-Korean 
dialogue, railroading of bills in the National Assembly, a 
series of man-made disasters, large-scale fraud involving banks, 
setbacks in workers' welfare programs and delay in revising 
labor laws, failure to carry out a pledge to allocate 5 percent 
of Gross National Product (GNP) for education, and personnel 
management based on personal links.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The Economic Planning 
Board will eliminate 17 jobs for grade one through nine 
officials, instead of the originally planned seven positions for 
grade one through four officials, under its downsizing plan. 
  Under the reorganization which will be implemented 
immediately after President Kim gives the go-ahead next week, 
the Economic Information and Education Bureau will be reduced to 
a division responsible for economic information in the Economic 
Planning Bureau. 
  The three bureau chief-level coordinators under the 
assistant 
minister for international policy coordination will be trimmed 
to two, while a new job of defense budget examination will be 
created under the assistant minister for budget. 
  The system of sending a bureau chief-level official to a 
foreign educational institution for study will be scrapped. 
  Several bureau-class offices will be rechristened: For 
instance, the Fair Trade Policy Bureau of the Fair Trade 
Commission will be renamed the Policy Bureau. 
  The reorganization plan will also affect some 20 
division-class offices: For example, in the Economic Planning 
Bureau, the manpower development planning division and the 
social development planning division will be merged into a new 
manpower division.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- Fewer Koreans moved to 
foreign countries while more overseas Koreans came back to Korea 
last year as the country achieved further political stability 
and economic development, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday. 
  The number of Koreans emigrating to foreign countries last 
year was the lowest since 1970, only 14,477, while people 
resettling in their home country showed a steady increase with 
8,781, according to the Ministry. 
  The number of emigrants did not reach 10,000 a year until 
1969, then recorded 16,268 in 1970 and soared to 46,000 in 1976. 
  During the 1980s, 26,000-37,000 Koreans a year moved to 
foreign countries. The number of Koreans who emigrated was 
23,314 in 1990 and decreased to 17,433 in 1991 and 17,927 in 
1992. 
  People who returned to South Korea numbered about 1,000 a 
year until the early 1980s, increasing to 4,700 in 1988, 6,400 
in 1990, 7,029 in 1991 and 8,892 in 1992. 
  Those who married foreigners and moved to other countries 
totaled only 1,510 last year, compared to 6,306 in 1979, and 
those who emigrated to live with relatives in foreign countries 
amounted to 6,044. 
  An official at the Foreign Ministry attributed the drop in 
emigration to a clear improvement in living conditions and 
political democratization here.

  [Text] Prime Minister Paul Keating says Canberra will 
refuse to take sides in any trade war between Japan and the 
United States. Mr. Keating repeated that Australia would not 
enter any bilateral arrangements that were detrimental to Japan, 
but said this was different to taking sides. He said the 
tension between Tokyo and Washington reflected fundamental 
underlying differences. 
  [Begin Keating recording] The U.S. and Japan will work that 
out. We shall create a new institution to work it out within, 
and that is APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]. APEC 
gives the United States and Japan a chance within an umbrella 
organization to look at their policy and trade differences, but 
they will always do it bilaterally as well as in any other 
framework. 
  There is a lot of serious thought about this relationship, 
and it is in terms of their current account -- that has had a 
problem for years -- and this tension underlines the savings 
imbalance between the two countries. Now, it is going to take 
time to work this out, but it is working itself out in the sense 
now that the United States is enjoying very rapid growth of 
exports into North and South Asia. So the dependency of Japan 
upon the U.S. as a market is diminishing and, like most 
problems, they tend naturally to work themselves out. [end 
recording]

  [Excerpts] The suspension of most flights to Australia by 
the American carrier, Northwest Airlines, will mildly embarrass 
both the airline and the Clinton administration which supported 
it in last year's aviation dispute with Qantas and our 
Government. American threats worked in that dispute. Now 
Northwest's need to trim costs has achieved what Australian 
diplomacy (and litigation) could not. Yesterday the airline was 
forced to announce the end of two of the three 
Detroit-Osaka-Sydney services Washington was so determined to 
protect. 
  But it would be unwise to declare a belated victory for 
Australia. Rather, Northwest's departure may only make more 
room for the larger American carrier, United Airlines. Of the 
four US airlines active in Australia at the beginning of 1992, 
two have now withdrawn altogether, and Northwest will be reduced 
to one weekly service from April. United, by contrast, is 
expanding its Australian flights. [passage omitted] 
  Northwest entered the market after signing agreements by 
which at least half the seating capacity would be taken by 
passengers originating in the US. The deal was supposed to 
minimise Northwest's impact on Japanese and Australian airlines 
servicing the Japan-Australia route. But Northwest flagrantly 
ignored the "50 per cent" rule. Last year Australia, with 
Japan's support, threatened to reduce Northwest's service unless 
the agreement was honoured. However, Washington retaliated with 
threats to cancel several direct-flight Qantas services to the 
US, Canberra capitulated, and Northwest continued to pick up 
most of its Australia-bound passengers in Japan. 
  Even so, Northwest was unable to turn a sufficient profit. 
But American eyes are still fixed on the profit potential of 
Asia, the world's fastest-growing aviation market. US interests 
conflict with those of countries in the region, including 
Australia, whose own carriers hope to dominate the market. So 
far, however, Australia has not come up with an effective answer 
to America's bullying but successful tactics.
